Link Official siteGod of War is a PC game. That still felt weird to say as I wrapped up my second playthrough over the holidays. Not far above it on my Steam library sits another game that is ""of War"" for a different master—Gears 5. Just a few years ago, these two tentpole series existing on the same device was impossible. Now they share a virtual shelf.Sony's latest angry dad game is evidence that the PC is the ultimate videogame unifier, and a great reminder of how the platform can bring out the best in games. I've killed my way across Midgard at 30 fps on a PS4 and 4K on PS5, but I don't think I can go back to either after 24 hours of buttery smooth monster chopping at 90+ fps. This is a damn good port, at least on my higher-end PC.If you skipped God of War 2018 or haven't touched the series at all, this is the God of War to play. All you need to know going in is that Kratos was Athena's best murder man until he was betrayed and decided to kill all of the gods (including his daddy, Zeus). This soft reboot picks up years later. In that time, Kratos left a now-godless Greece and wandered into the Norse lands, where he gained a wife (who has just passed away at the start of the game), a son named Atreus, and a glorious beard.God of War is its restraint. It's a small story in a world of gigantic characters. Kratos and Atreus aren't out to save the world—they just want to spread their wife/mother's ashes on a big mountain. They're not looking for a fight, but end up walking into a bunch of them because, apparently, Midgard has been a nightmare land of evil trolls, poison witches, and zombies for the last century or so. Much of the game is basically carving a path through this broken world, unraveling the petty god drama that led to its ruin.There's a lot of The Last of Us and Uncharted in its puzzly moments—hoisting young Atreus up a ledge to kick down a rope and jostling dilapidated supports to make a bridge are pages straight out of the Naughty Dog playbook—but these familiar puzzles get to have a lot of fun with Kratos' superhuman strength.My strongest memories all revolve around one of the greatest weapons in videogames: the Leviathan Axe.It's both cool and funny how often Atreus ponders how they're going to cross a gap just as Kratos lifts a beam the size of six cars or spins an entire building like it's a windup toy. Where Nathan Drake looks for a chain to lift an ancient pulley, Kratos simply throws his axe at the gears so hard that they spin. For a character that used to mostly show his toughness by killing every living thing in the room, it's nice to see Kratos throw his weight around the world itself. Lifting big rocks wouldn't be near as fun without the back and forth banter with Atreus (or as he's often called, ""boy""). It's not exactly a new narrative trick to pair a strong silent type with an inquisitive youngster, but unlike the developing relationship of Joel and Ellie, Atreus and Kratos already have a layered rapport that's steadily peeled back over time. It's obvious from the jump that the two aren't close. Atreus is determined to prove he's ready to make the journey and pressured to live up to Kratos' high standards (""Do not be sorry. Be better,"" Kratos tells him after taking a careless shot at a deer). Kratos, meanwhile, is an emotionally distant father who projects his own issues on other people.Their relationship evolves organically as they take on the world together, but Sony Santa Monica was smart to let side characters do some heavy lifting as well. One character introduced halfway through is easily the best part of the game, a wise old grandpa figure brimming with useful advice and stories to fill the dead air while the trio boat around Midgard.For as good as God of War's characters and stories are, my strongest memories all revolve around one of the greatest weapons in videogames: the Leviathan Axe. The axe is your primary weapon and do-it-all multitool throughout the entire game. It can pry open doors, destroy obstacles, freeze machinery in place, or be thrown the length of a football field to nab hard-to-reach loot. In combat, the Leviathan is a gratifying balance of heft and speed that hits a lot harder than Kratos' old Blades of Chaos. Here, again, Sony Santa Monica leverages Kratos' supernatural might to let you do impossible things with an axe, like cleave three enemies in half with a single move.Then there's the Leviathan's other perk. You've probably seen cool gifs of Kratos throwing the axe at a draugr and recalling it back to his hand like Thor's Mjölnir hammer. It feels just as cool as it looks and doesn't stop being cool for dozens of hours. Axe combat translates surprisingly well to keyboard and mouse, too: left and right mouse are standard attacks and you have to hold Ctrl to ready a throw. It was a good sign for God of War's default keybindings when I instinctually called back the axe by pressing the standard R reload key and it totally worked. That said, reaching for Ctrl might become a nuisance after a while if you don't have pinkies of steel. You can chuck the axe like a boomerang for a quick attack that bounces off enemies or throw it overhead for a harder hit that sticks and freezes them in place. It often made sense for me to leave that pinned enemy in place, because axe-less Kratos can still fight with his two meaty fists.Because nothing in God of War goes to waste, unarmed combat is an entirely different beast with its own skill tree and advantages. Blunt blows don’t deal as much damage as the axe, but they do fill enemy stagger meters super fast. Once fully staggered, Kratos can seal the deal with an instant execution straight out of Doomguy's library of glory kills. These spectacle kills are so satisfying that I was constantly looking for an excuse to lose the axe and go full boxer. Backing up Kratos at all times is Atreus, who has a dedicated button to command him to shoot arrows at whoever you're targeting. This on-the-fly weapon swapping creates fun improvisational brawls that compliment every fighting style. I can keep spamming light attack, or I could go full galaxy brain by pinning the biggest guy in place with the axe, beating fodder zombies to a pulp, and recalling the axe at just the right angle to slice through an enemy on the way back. When the stars align, I'm chaining moves in a literal combat loop. Everything matters at the same time, even if I could one-trick with the axe through most of the game.You get more cool stuff as the story progresses that you're best off seeing yourself, so much that I was a little overwhelmed by choice in the back half of the game. I tried hard to make the most out of every awesome way I have to kill stuff and yet Atreus would still berate me for not asking him to shoot arrows enough. I'm sorry kid, I just get carried away with axe headshots and forget about your wimpy arrows sometimes.Nvidia's upscaling tech has gotten so good I'm not sure why you'd ever flip it off when it's available.My second God of War playthrough was my best playthrough, and it had everything to do with the higher framerate I enjoyed with this PC port. Like Days Gone and Horizon: Zero Dawn before it, God of War flies on a good PC. On an RTX 3060 at 1920x1080, I was able to crank up the target fps to 90 and mostly stay there with Nvidia DLSS set to Quality. I noticed things got a little choppier during doorway transitions to the open-world lake area, but the frames would steady after a while. God of War also runs fine without DLSS, though at this point, Nvidia's upscaling tech has gotten so good I'm not sure why you'd ever flip it off when it's available. Little issues that plagued earlier versions of DLSS (like that weird ghosting effect you'd see on the small floating particles) are cleaned up nowadays, and what's left is an AI-assisted upscaled image that I can hardly discern from a native 1080p image. The magic trick may be a little less convincing if you scale it down to Balanced or Ultra Performance, but Quality is a safe bet for 1080p gaming. As for 1440p or 4K, I'm unfortunately ill-equipped to give it a go.DLSS isn't the only flavor or upscaling supported by God of War, either. You can alternatively flip on AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution. I don't have as much experience with this one, but I noticed a bit more blurriness when set to quality. It's still good, and as a frame-hungry PC gamer, I'd keep it on if it was my only choice.I also fiddled with individual graphics options here and there, of which God of War has several but not everything you could ask for, though I was satisfied with the game's simple presets. The game defaults to the curiously named ""Original"" preset (which I assume means the original PS4 look). I played mostly on Original and it looked great throughout, but I did notice sharper textures and post-processing on High and Ultra. My Kratos looks so good I can just about reach out and touch his wrinkly face.It's exciting to think about what God of War's landing on PC could mean for the console exclusive status quo. Sony has a dedicated PC publishing label now. As the company gets more serious about PC ports, will we ever get to the point where its games release on PC months after launch instead of years? Could it even pull a Microsoft and drop everything on PC at the same time as console?That's probably a stretch, but God of War is a positive sign. The best game on the PS4 is now one of the best games on PC.I was one of those people that scoffed at Dad of War when it was announced. I thought we were getting The Last of Us with an axe, but instead, we got a fully-fledged RPG with tiered loot and skill trees expertly weaved into a story about power, violence, and bad parents. It's an impressive departure from the edgy slaughter fest that this series used to be and a necessary change if it was going to come back at all. The mountain of money, talent, and time it took to reboot this 2000s relic into something worth existing today is evident in every moment. Four years later, God of War is still a triumph. The best game on PS4 is now one of the best games on PC.Morgan has been writing for PC Gamer since 2018, first as a freelancer and currently as a staff writer.

Eurogamer,"Here comes the head-stepper.Remove the heart. Climb on the chest, feet slapping against sinew and skin. The ruined flesh beneath shudders but holds. The first incision. One to pierce the surface. The second to part the ribs with a brisk crack. The heart is in there, but it's well connected. Reach deep. Pull. Remove the heart. Pull.Something about this incident gets at, well, the heart of God of War. It is ridiculous and petulant, a world in which gods are just giants and giants can be felled and there is still, regardless of your own beliefs or lack of them, something of a guilty shudder to that. But it's also sort of realistic, or at least it cleaves to the most superficial elements of reality: to the human textures of the shells we all bumble around in, the warm depths. And it's disgusting, but it's also businesslike: we are kept in our place, and - if you look closely, as it were, at what we are shown and not shown - we are quietly shielded from the least palatable aspects of it. God of War is so committed to getting us close to acts of depravity that at times - when it's literally tugging at the heart - it steps back just a little and reveals its secret, shameful conservatism.Then there's this, of course: that heart is one grotesque highlight nestled in amongst an endless run of highlights. Everything is a glissando here, in a game of one god set against all the others. Kratos will have forgotten the heart ten minutes from now, even though it bloomed and shimmered when he held it aloft, like a Pimms jug with a couple of glowsticks in it. And ten minutes from then? What fresh horrors will he be up to by that point?None of these things are criticisms. God of War is so lavish, so sharp-edged with technological brilliance, so studied in its understanding of everything a big budget game needs in order to make people feel the bigness of its budget that these internal contradictions are welcome, because they give it a bit of life, a bit of warmth. They give it, I almost want to say, a bit of humanity. Just a bit.Anyway, God of War is back. Not quite rebooted but certainly heavily retooled. Kratos is even more serious now, and even more violent. And he's taken a bit of a trip, washing up in the Christmas forests of Midgard, Greek gods a muddy stain behind him, Norse gods forming a gauntlet of freewheeling hicks and Biro-tatted hoboes up ahead. There's a shift in location, then, but this most beautiful of series is very capable with the frozen north, with rocks and moss and trees and snow underfoot. There's a shift in the cast, but gods are gods in a world like this, which means they are sleazy, compromised, fallen and corrupt. The Greek world was connected by chains, this one is threaded into the roots of a tree, and yet there is an understanding that both realities can coexist. All beliefs are equally real, equally foolish. The chains and the tree do not cancel each other out.So what's the big difference? It's tempting to say that it's the boy - the son, Atreus - that Kratos now takes on his adventure. God of War meets The Last of Us? But this isn't entirely true. We'll get to the boy, but the main shift is one of perspective. In previous God of War games, you were big but the world was bigger, so Kratos, perversely, was often quite small, an ant crawling over a Titan the size of a mountain range. That elastic camera would sacrifice your sense of personal size in order to give the Greek myths their panoramic due. Here, though, Kratos is given his weight and stature and it never leaves him. The camera moves in close and it stays close. We see the world at almost all times from over his gigantic shoulder. He is a marvel: muscle twisting and bunching beneath the tats, weighty flesh casting shadows, skin stretching and revealing scars, one along the back that I cannot stop wincing at, one running over the stomach and suggesting, even if it runs in the wrong direction, a weird hint of cesarean childbirth. Kratos' beard: you can see every strand of the thing, just as you can see the glossy irises of the eyes, just as you can read his age, his agonies, in the bruising beneath the sockets of those eyes. He is the main character, but he is also the theme and the backstory, all of it on display at all times, all of it written in the things that happen to flesh. The world is another marvel, thankfully, capable of suitable deity-crushing bigness despite the fact that you're wedged so close to the surface with none of that sprightly wandering of the old game's cinematic camera. The detailing, though! Silver birches have peeling curlicues of bark, rocks have little cracks running through them, huts are made of planks of wood that do not meet cleanly, that do not match. All of the extraordinary flights of fancy of the gods and their realms builds upon this sense of reality, of messy wilderness. This means when the game takes you somewhere extraordinary it does not purely feel like a set-dressing change, but it also does not feel entirely natural. The gods' worlds are impositions, garish indulgences, and they look like it - because the gods are children, and they are forced, perhaps through the weight of expectations, to remain children. An interesting choice, really, to come in close. These games have always been graphical showcases, and they show, this time, that the things we like to look at have changed. God of War is as spectacular as all the other God of Wars, and there are still those dizzying shifts in scale that define the series' imagination, but the designers have also developed an eye for the smaller things and found a way to make it all work together.It feels a bit like Tomb Raider in this regard - another reboot that sought to bring the camera in closer and rediscover the natural world and make things a little less pulpy as it did so. Crucial to this aim in God of War is Kratos' son. Atreus, who sets off with Kratos at the start of the game on a mournful, treacherous mission that his father does not think he is ready for. The less said of the plot the better - it is simultaneously filled with spoilers and light on any real sense of forward momentum, offering complications and frustrations rather than genuine developments that might enrich proceedings - but the character of Atreus is well-realised for the most part. Sure, he is a surprisingly Californian son for a Greek god seeking refuge in the frozen north - at one point he stalks away from an argument with a petulant, ""Whatever..."" - but this is a series that has always been playful in combining modern sensibilities with its ancient cast, in understanding that the ancients saw their gods as contemporary beings. He is dark-eyed, scarred and watchful, Atreus, but beneath the heavy burden of backstory and the hacked-about Hoxton haircut, he has a lot of genuine child to him. I think someone involved in God of War may even have had a kid of their own for a while. Riding on a timber lift, he will bounce up and down on the springy planks filled with aimless energy. He is nervous around his remote father one minute and teasing the next. He pushes things and you fear for him. This glimmer of actual life inside him makes up for so much of the game's trajectory, which spends too long, in amongst the predictably gradual thawing between father and son, on that annoying idea that the best a child can be is a perfected version of the parent - or that, at the very least, they must in some ways be defined by their relationship to the parent's flaws.Thankfully, as a game character, Atreus behaves very well too, keeping himself alive and warping, I suspect, in and out when I'm not looking to avoid snagging himself on geometry. Out of combat he is a hint system, a plot reminder and a means of making the subtext of a moment clear even to people who like to check their messages during cutscenes. In combat, he is a ranged weapon with his bow and arrow and has some nice magical trinkets hidden away in the upgrade menu. God, it was a happy day when I realised I could slot a rune or whatever it was into a socket in him and make him summon a spectral herd of wild boar at trying moments. That's my boy, off into battle, awaiting my cry of, ""Ghost-pigs! Hit them with the ghost-pigs!""As runes and sockets suggests, God of War has become very excited about items and levels and other RPG trappings. Fights grant XP, which allow you to unlock new skills for your various weapons, but enemies also drop Hacksilver and resources that you can submit to a pair of blacksmiths to buy and upgrade armour and other handy bits of kit. Everything has a socket which allows you to trick things out further, and Kratos' stats are divided into categories like strength, defence, vitality and luck. This stuff links together in a friendly muddle and means that you always have a reason to dip into a menu and give your axe a new pommel, say, which might boost this or that, or to slot an enchantment into armour. I tended to let my XP build up - a sure sign that there isn't anything truly earth-shattering lurking amongst all the literal earth-shattering going on with the skills to spend it on - but it's still nice to locate a perk that allows me to summon a boulder and chuck it, or unlock a nice launcher move. It looks the part, in other words, but the depths are never deep enough to lose your way in. God of War has loot and items and crafting, but it's not Diablo, just as it has a bit of gentle gear-gating but it's not Metroid.What it is is God of War, thankfully, and the recipe is surprisingly unchanged despite the son and his echoes of The Last of Us and despite the new mournfulness and the tragedy beard and the close-up camera. Moment to moment this is light, visually appealing puzzling, often with an enormously satisfying pay-off as ancient machinery turns, or as forgotten doors open, or as an entire island spins on its axis like the mechanism of an old watch. It's a bit of that, yes, and a bit of no-fuss traversal as Atreus hops on your back and you gamble up an artfully rendered cliff-face emerging into the rosy light of another perfect dawn. And then it's a bit of exploration, through a world that is perhaps a little more open than before and has side-quests - and a lot of backtracking - sprinkled in, but remains, at heart, a series of extremely pretty corridors connecting hubs and battle arenas.All of this and then combat, and combat remains the biggy.It is still such a joy, too, such a sometimes-tactical, technical-as-you-want-it-to-be, shamefully violent, blood-rushing pleasure. Kratos appears to have traded his chains for an axe, but the range of the chains is still available since the axe can be chucked at people and then summoned again with an outstretched hand, and it can also be swung with great force and purpose, cleaving distant archers in two, knocking tanks sideways, or sending ripples of ice through the ground. You can parry and dodge with precision, or you can knock down the difficulty to the point where neither is required. Enemies, ranging from teleporting witches to the spindly, Peperami-in-armour forces of the Northern undead Draugr all come with their attack quirks and all succumb eventually, often exploding in bright gouts of Lucozade, while the chugging economy of being an angry god thunders through the game, violence allowing your rage to grow, and rage being cashed in for moments of absolute frenzy in which violence suddenly rebuilds your health bar. Is the axe as much fun as the chains? Not entirely if I'm being honest, and there are signs the developers realise this since the axe is joined, in the second half, by further weapons which should not be spoiled. And as the action increases and the XP starts to get pumped into different abilities, a true synthesis emerges between Kratos and Atreus. In another developer's hands this would have felt like a prolonged escort mission, bringing the kid along, but there is none of that in God of War. On the standard settings, at least, Atreus looks after himself and you both look after each other. The escorting is saved for quiet moments of exposition.The regular fights - elemental baddies, baddies with shields, baddies who hover and spit fire - are so much fun that the bosses almost take a backseat. They're still spectacular, of course, but the stage-management of them, with which they pull you between arena-brawling and moments of lofty on-rails theatrics, make them feel a little less alive than the basic scrapping. In a game about the indulgences of the gods, these are the indulgences of the real higher powers: the designers. Even here, though, the sheer drama of being a god who hates other gods steps in to keep things fresh. You fight a winged beast by racing up over its scaly back and into its mouth where much dentistry awaits; you knock a man through a mountain and then he knocks you through another. It's astonishing stuff to look at and playing on a PS4 Pro the frame-rate never faltered (although the audio occasionally hitched and there was the odd pause for loading).Such are the intricate pleasures of brawling your way through Midgard and beyond, it can sometimes be hard to notice all the game's wilder ambitions. Despite the plotting, I didn't really reflect much on God of War's relationship with the other big relationship games out there: Kratos and Atreus just sort of get on with it. Despite the backtracking, I didn't really think much about the fact that the whole adventure was knotted up in an audacious, improbably calm single shot with no cutaways or flashbacks. There's padding and asset reuse, but look at the richness of the assets and the world they are delivering. And at the end of it there's still so much left to mop up, still so much that remains unseen. God of War does a lot with holy light and crumbling temples, but one of its best moments involves waves of enemies and two bonfires that must not be extinguished. It is capable of making fun from very straightforward things.Yes. Like Kratos, the god of fury who must learn not to fear his son, this is a strange beast, really. The latest technology and astonishing craft and artistry are employed to deliver a game of extremely simple pleasures - a wash of new pseudo-ideas that cannot hide the fact that the basics remain unfixed because they were not broken. God of War dresses things up, in other words, but it is ultimately the same deal it always was. As is the way with myths, I guess. As is the way with gods.

Metro GameCentral,"One of the best PlayStation exclusives ever made gets an updated PC version that looks and plays better than ever.Given that all of Sony’s exclusives this year are cross-gen it’s still unclear when anyone will be able to stick a fork in the PlayStation 4 generation and say that it’s done; especially now that Sony has restarted production of the console. That also means nobody can say, without fear of future contradiction, which is the best exclusive. For PlayStation 4, we can’t imagine that ever not being Bloodborne but in terms of internally developed Sony games our pick would be God Of War – one of the best sequels of all time.Although the lack of numbers and subtitles in its name implies a reboot this is nothing of the sort; there’s a major time skip but it follows on directly from the original games. You don’t need to have played the earlier titles to understand what’s going on, but the new game is surprisingly vague about the past of protagonist Kratos and his interactions with the Greek pantheon of gods.A detailed knowledge of series lore is not essential to enjoying God Of War but where you do miss out is in appreciating the difference between how Kratos is portrayed here, when compared to the originals. Before the PlayStation 4 he was nothing but a brutish thug and, unless you were an angsty teenager, one of the most unlikeable characters in all gaming. This new game has many great qualities, but its greatest achievement is making Kratos seem like a relatable person.As with Sony’s other PC ports this doesn’t feature any new content, so apart from the improved visuals it’s essentially exactly the same as the PlayStation 4 game, our original review for which you can read here. Rather than ancient Greece, the new game – and the follow-up due later this year – are set several decades later in an unspecified part of Scandinavia. The game’s setting is strange, though, in that there are almost no human characters and no attempt to portray the region as inhabited by anything other than ghosts, gods, and monsters.You also get to visit several of the other nine realms from Norse mythology (the Marvel movies are a surprisingly good primer for many of the concepts and characters) but the story starts with Kratos burying his wife and embarking on an arduous journey to scatter her ashes from the highest peak in the Nine Realms. Accompanying him is his young son Atreus, with who Kratos has great difficulty connecting.What transpires is a third person action adventure very much in the mould of Sony games like The Last Of Us and Horizon Zero Dawn. However, there are some light role-playing elements to God Of War, and a more complex combat system, that give the action a depth and variety that its stablemates often lack.On its original release Sony was very careful not to describe the game as open world, but it is really, even if there is only one major open plan area. By the end you can go anywhere you want, whenever you want, but there’s also a Metroidvania style structure that sees you returning to previous areas to unlock new pathways and locations as you gain new powers and equipment.This certainly isn’t Metroid Dread in 3D though and while there are many obvious comparisons to make with other games and genres God Of War manages to avoid feeling formulaic by always offering at least a small twist on existing conventions.Despite a range of different armour and charms, Kratos’ only weapon in the game is an axe which he can throw like Thor’s hammer from the Marvel movies and recall it with the press of a button. There are no combos as such, but you do gain a shield to parry with and, like the original games, there are still elements that bear comparison with Japanese games such as Devil May Cry and Bayonetta, including the ability to ‘juggle’ enemies in the air and an optional bullet time effect.Arteus can also help out with his bow and arrow but there’s no pretending that the combat is as involved as its Japanese counterparts, but then there’s a lot more going on in God Of War than just fighting.God Of War’s narrative is linear but for once it uses the long running time of a video game to its advantage, so that the slow thawing of Kratos’ personality feels organic and natural. The game’s themes of parenthood and acknowledging the mistakes of your past feel all the more incisive precisely because Kratos used to be just a one-dimensional monster, creating a character arc that feels surprisingly relevant despite the fantasy setting.As with everything else, the game’s flaws are exactly the same as last time, with the lack of enemy variety becoming very obvious by the end, with some of the most blatant palette-swapping since the 16-bit era. The role-playing elements can also seem quite superfluous, as if they were added in late in development just to give the illusion of greater gameplay depth.Alan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNew Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart bundle is £50 off reveals leakXbox will be less hands-off with Bethesda amid major reorganisationIn terms of visuals, the original always looked great but naturally it’s even better on PC. You’ve got support for 4K resolution, unlocked frame rates, improved reflections and shadows, DLSS, and all the trimmings. Of particular note though is the 21:9 ultra-widescreen option and mouse and keyboard support where someone actually seems to have sat down and thought about it for more than five minutes – instead of just assuming everyone will use a joypad (which they should, but that’s not the point).God Of War is one of the best games of the last generation and it’s lost none of its appeal over the last four years. The only problem with this PC version is that PC gamers are much less likely to have played the originals than PlayStation owners, so the full impact of Kratos’ character development may be lost. That’s not nearly a good enough reason to miss out on such an excellent game though and if nothing else this new version makes the wait for God Of War Ragnarök all the more tantalising.In Short: Kratos looks better than ever in this welcome PC port of one of the best action adventures of the outgoing generation.Pros: Some of the best storytelling ever in an action game, with a fascinating reinvention of Kratos’ character and an extremely well-crafted game world that’s full of secrets. Good PC port.Cons: The combat isn’t the deepest and the role-playing elements feel somewhat superfluous.

Here’s how it works.One of PlayStation’s finest moments, Kratos has been reimagined for a new audience while keeping the best bits of what originally made him great. An incredible spectacle of combat and actionGreat characters, story and a beautifully realised semi-open worldSo much to see, investigate and doUpgrades are initially confusingIt’s not always clear if you have the right tool for an enemy or puzzle yetWhy you can trust GamesRadar+ 


Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy.There’s a moment in God of War when you realise you can go anywhere. Clear of the opening set up, the game steps back, presents you with a map of the world and says, ‘you know what? You’re a demigod, you’ve got a boat: sort yourself out.’ It’s perhaps the biggest change to the series, aside from the [deep breath] combat, Kratos, timezone, location, gods, monsters... beard. The ability to go anywhere and do anything in a semi-open world suddenly makes this as much about your journey through Kratos’ story as it is any of his goals. Don’t worry, though, there’s still a tightly woven tale here. It’s beautifully rhythmic and perfectly paced as it ebbs and flows through violently crashing narrative crescendos and quieter, expositional lulls. Now, however, you can control when to mainline the plot, or just wander off in a canoe and explore. For a series more traditionally built on a carefully controlled theme park ride of excitement and set pieces, this newfound freedom is just as much a rush as any building-sized monster with oh-so-gougeable eyes. These changes mean this God of War works whether it's your first time with Kratos or you know the man well. There are call outs that will mean more to some than others, but nothing to alienate a newcomer. The new (old) world Kratos now roams the Norse realm of Midgard. He’s older, beardier and a very changed man, mourning a wife not long dead and with a son, Atreus, to raise. I’ll steer clear of any spoilers but, safe to say, some things happen, and you set off into the world to do something about it. Mainly by being grumpy about stuff and hitting it with an axe. God of War won't stop with Norse mythology - prepare for ancient Egyptian and Mayan locations tooPerhaps God of War’s greatest achievement in all this is making Kratos a likable character. The original PS2 games’ vicious edge and misogyny got somewhat of a pass from its cartoonish sheen and sheer outlandishness but, as things got more realistic on PS3, the Ghost of Sparta became increasingly harder to enjoy. He was just a spiteful, cruel man full of rage and with almost no redeeming qualities. Now, he’s wiser: aware of, and unhappy with, his past. Trying, as he so often repeats to Atreus, to “be better” while gruffly and inexpertly attempting to pass on what he’s learned the long way round to prevent his son repeating his mistakes. Hoping to make both the boy and his future a better place as a result. This is wisely done without ever ignoring what went before - Kratos never denies or excuses his history, just a desire to ensure he doesn’t pass it on. It’s not hard to read more into the God of War’s attempts to be a good man as the series reinvents itself for a new generation, minus the sex mini-games and exposed breasts of before. As a result the relationship between father and son is everything. It’s full of frustration, awkward moments of bonding, and popping breakthroughs of progress. You’ll be rooting as much for them to just sort it out, as you are for hacking up a 30 foot troll. Their chats, as you explore, develop them, the world and characters around them in detail, and every person you meet is expertly realised, written and performed. This has some of the best storytelling and cast in a game for a long time, and even the most incidental conversation is written with all the weight and care of a major cutscene. It’s funny too, in a very ‘real’ way, not just jokes for jokes’ sake. I can’t say much without spoiling it but there are interactions, one liners and interplays that feel believable and human, even if there is a massive fantasy monster crashing about in the background. Plus it’s got one of most interesting and different villains I’ve seen for awhile. Every person you meet is expertly realised, written and performed. This has some of the best storytelling and cast in a game for a long timeYou’ve probably noticed I haven’t even touched on the combat yet, mainly because there’s so much going on with characters, world and story. There is plenty of fighting though, so don’t worry - brutal, bloody, ‘can’t unsee what you just did to that man’s face’ fighting, with a system that’s spectacularly physical and flexible. Kratos’ chained blades have been replaced by the Leviathan Axe, a more focused and drawn in weapon. Using a combo system of light and heavy blows it’s about prioritising threats and managing space with dodges and parries around ever-closing enemies.The upgrade systems driving the combat are huge, letting you build out both Kratos and Atreus’ abilities, gear and armour on multiple skill trees: the latter mainly able to unleash stunning arrows, or choke enemies (weakening them for an axing) with a press of Square. Then there’s magic, the ability to throw the axe as a projectile and fight with your fists, a shield for rebounding parries, and more. The options initially seem daunting because of the scale - there’s just so much to consider with a range of stats that can be hard to decipher at first. Is +3 Strength better than +10 Runic overall? If this new bit of kit drops my Luck by two will that matter? If I’m honest I didn’t feel entirely comfortable with it all that until at least 20 hour so hours in. However, the system grows as you master it into a devastating arsenal of splintering, crushing damage. It’s a beautiful thing to watch as you swiftly dodge and counter, or time a cleaving blow perfectly. Atreus also becomes increasingly useful as you power him up and, by the end, you’ll be fighting as a coordinated unit - both from hammering Square to call out his arrows and magic, or contextual attacks. For example, when you’re bent over from a heavy axe blow he’ll jump from your shoulders to rain arrows down on your target as he flies past. It is just the best thing.Elsewhere this is every bit as brutally unflinching as previous games. Rib cages are torn open with bare hands, or jaws are left hanging on strips of skin. Vicious curb stomps will make you flinch for a second, before gently whispering ‘again’ and diving straight back in. Unrecognisable in a lot of ways, this still is 100% a God of War game when the action flexes it ample muscle. The series’ sense of scale is still there, just redirected and more equally distributed. In the same way the old games would make you blink in disbelief at the scale of a single boss fight or set piece, this applies that to the entire world. Every region, each place you visit, has a colossus, hydra or Titan’s worth of ‘WOW’ applied across every inch of Midgard’s soil, rock and mountains. There are frogs in this game, hopping around the background, that are better crafted than some entire game campaigns. And, when the game does roll up its sleeves for a spectacle, it does not disappoint.How God of War's combat team made Kratos' new axe feel so goodSomething that’s really cleverly done is how you use your flesh-rending arsenal to also interact with the wider world. God of War’s map is full of puzzles and navigational obstacles to hack, thump and fire at. For a vocabulary mainly built on hitting things it’s incredible just how satisfying the language of solving problems is. At a basic level your axe can freeze cogs to hold a door open, say, but as you progress, how you reach that cog escalates, or other mechanics come into play. There are gear-gated elements that hold things back for later with barriers you can’t pass or solve until you have certain items or skills. These gently corral you back to the main story, only to return later with a new tool and a dawning epiphany of what that means for whatever you couldn’t get past before. Even now, a good 15 hours post credits, I’m still finding new areas, and puzzles that have me slow-clapping the screen at whoever made the damn thing. They’re rarely a chore and with a level of ingenuity up there with Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild’s Korok Seeds when you see something familiar flipped in a way you’d never have predicted. It’s a world that continues in a very satisfying way long after you’ve ‘finished’ the main story. You can occasionally find yourself unsure if you’re doing something wrong, or don’t have the right equipment yetThat openness, combined with the range of abilities to unlock, can leave you a little confused sometimes. Possibly my only real criticism is that you can occasionally find yourself unsure if you’re doing something wrong, or don’t have the right equipment yet. Is it you, or the game, that has the problem? Are you solving this puzzle wrong? Or just lacking the right tool? Is this enemy too hard for a reason? Or just because you haven’t found the thing that hurts it more?Realistically, however, I don’t think it’s possible to overstate just how good God of War is; how well realised its world, how nuanced and layered its characters and storytelling. The depth and craft of its combat, puzzles and almost every system it has sparkles and shines with an indulgence and luxury that regularly stopped me in my tracks to drink it all in. Whether breathless and bloody in the aftermath of an axe-hacked victory, or watching Kratos and his son Atreus share a genuinely human moment, this is a level of game making that doesn’t happen often. The final question really isn’t about where it sits in any game of the year discussions, but rather its place in eventual game of the generation talks. I'm GamesRadar's Senior Guides Co-ordinator, which means I run GamesRadar's guides and tips content.

Metro GameCentral,"The PS4 gets another stunning-looking exclusive, but this radical reboot presents Kratos as you’ve never seen him before.This is one of the most peculiar sequels we’ve ever played. God Of War has almost nothing in common with the previous games in terms of gameplay, characters, or tone. There are certainly similarities, but this is a soft reboot of the entire series that holds absolutely nothing about the previous titles sacrosanct. For those tired of decades old franchises that never seem to change this is the ultimate antidote to lazy, identikit sequels.The original God Of War games were created as a response to Japanese-made action titles such as Devil May Cry and, latterly, Bayonetta. The combat system wasn’t quite as complex or versatile but it was certainly comparable, and the games had much more coherent storytelling and taxing puzzle-solving. They also featured perhaps the most dislikeable protagonist in all video games: Kratos – a violent, amoral monster whose senseless quest for vengeance ended up wiping out the entire pantheon of Greek gods.What’s fascinating about this new God Of War (it has no number or subtitle after its name but it is, to all intents and purposes, God Of War 4) is that it’s not just the gameplay that has evolved but also Kratos himself. He’s still a word class grumpy guts, but he’s become ashamed of his previous life and now struggles to connect with his young son Atreus – for whom it’s implied he’s been a largely absent father.As the game begins Atreus’ mother has just died and Kratos sets out to fulfil her last wish, of having her ashes scattered from atop the highest mountain in the nine realms. This seemingly simple request remains the goal for the entire game but getting there proves extremely complicated.Rather than Ancient Greece, Kratos now lives in what is vaguely implied to be Norway. But you don’t meet a single living human in the entire game, just ghosts, the odd dwarf, and other supernatural beings. We’re not sure why but Sony has been careful not to describe the game as open world, even though it essentially is. Not in the GTA sense of a giant sandbox environment, but despite what early previews implied the game is not linear or split into chapters and you can travel wherever you want almost from the start.There’s more than a touch of Metroidvania to this new God Of War, and while the landscapes are a lot smaller and more constrained than they first appear – thanks to the stunning visuals – exploration is still a key element and extremely rewarding given the wide range of genuinely useful items you can come across.The original games used a mostly fixed camera perspective but this God Of War is viewed over the shoulder, not unlike the identically acronymed Gears Of War. This obviously has a significant effect on the gameplay, although the combat is already very different given that for the majority of the time Kratos’ only weapon is a magic axe which he can throw like Thor’s hammer from the Marvel movies and have it immediately fly back to his hand.Kratos also has the option to fight bare-handed, which increases the chances of stunning an enemy and performing an execution move, but most of the time you’ll be flinging your axe at long range and making use of simple light and heavy attacks when fighting up close. Kratos also has a slowly charging rage mode, but while additional moves and abilities can be unlocked via a skill tree, or by finding special amulets, there’s not really anything in the way of traditional combos.There are more advanced moves, including a dodge, a parry with your shield, and the ability to ‘juggle’ enemies in the air by repeatedly hitting them but on normal difficulty most enemies don’t require much more than a bit of button-mashing and some basic situational awareness. But there are much harder opponents, especially some of the optional ones, and here it helps to equip more advanced techniques such as a Bayonetta style slow-mo effect and an ability that prevents enemies from interrupting your attacks.We’ve no doubt that many are going to accuse the game of having shallow combat, and they do have a point. Atreus can help out with various trick arrows and support abilities but once you learn each enemy’s repartee you’re seldom in much danger. Especially by about the halfway mark when, as long as you do a reasonable number of side missions, you’ll be largely unstoppable with the improved armour and abilities at your command.God Of War has a fairly involved role-playing system that has you unlocking skill trees, upgrading amulets, and crafting and improving armour – and it does all make a difference. But at the same it often seems somewhat superfluous; an unnecessary layer of complication that’s only there to try and hide the game’s innate shallowness.But even being aware of the game’s tricks we have to say that we don’t care. If anything the puzzles running out of new ideas before the end is more problematic than the combat, which while a little basic never stops being fun. There’s a great sense of violence and impact, with some excellent sound design, although existing God Of War fans may be disappointed by the relative lack of gore. The game can get a bit nasty at times but the mere fact that most enemies aren’t even flesh and blood limits the amount of offal flying around.We can’t say we missed the almost fetishistic levels of violence from the previous games but we were a little surprised at the paucity of traditional boss battles. And despite how nutty Norse mythology can get the ordinary enemies feel slightly uninspired, with lots of palette-swapped trolls and zombie guys but few really unique designs.On the positive side this is another game, after the recent Far Cry 5, that is elevated by the quality of its side quests. There aren’t that many, but most take place in their own separate part of the game world and always involve a distinct story element and a unique and useful reward. They also provide God Of War with a significant endgame to mop up with, even after the main story lasts a lengthy 20 hours or more.Surprisingly though, it is the quality of that story which is the most impressive element of the whole game. God Of War clearly borrows a lot of ideas from other Sony titles, most obviously The Last Of Us and Horizon Zero Dawn. The latter, in particular, could also be accused of covering up simplistic gameplay with unneeded role-playing elements but the two games are very different in their approach to storytelling. Horizon has an interesting backstory but the actual story and characters are fairly dull and generic.By comparison we’re not sure God Of War’s plot makes a lick of sense, even by the surreal standards of Norse mythology, but the themes it deals with are serious modern day issues involving parenthood, responsibility, and fellowship. And despite spending so many years as a one-dimensional male power fantasy Kratos proves to be the perfect conduit for these subjects.The game takes a few narrative shortcuts – a lot of Kratos’ character development takes place offscreen between this game and God Of War III, while Atreus has a few rather sudden changes of heart – but it absolutely works. Rather than the tedious moralising it might sound like, Kratos’ shift in attitude is slow and organic, and the reasons he changes make perfect sense in context. And all without creating any narrative dissonance when he starts beating trolls and ogres to death with his bare hands.What’s so fun about Greek and Norse mythology is that their gods are just as petty and flawed as ordinary mortals and so their elaborate family feuds are just as relevant now as when their stories were first told, allowing the game to tackle serious social issues in a fantasy context.Alan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNew Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart bundle is £50 off reveals leakTop 10 new Halloween board games and tabletop RPGs 2023The central question in God Of War is whether people already set in their ways can change, but there’s also a clear meta narrative that asks the same about a media franchise like God Of War. And the inspiring answer is that big name games can dare to do things differently; just because they’ve been doing the same thing for decades doesn’t mean they have to carry on that way.God Of War is certainly not without flaws but it’s easily the best in the series and thoroughly entertaining from beginning to end. It’s also one of the best story-based action games we’ve ever played, turning a character we used to loathe into a surprisingly sympathetic role model.In Short: A top-to-bottom revamp of the whole God Of War franchise that matches thrilling, if slightly shallow, combat and exploration with some impressively trenchant storytelling.Pros: The new visual style and combat work extremely well, with an interesting and secret-filled game world. Excellent storytelling and great use of Kratos’ character. Stunning graphics.Cons: The combat is highly enjoyable but relatively simplistic, at least on normal difficulty. Slightly uninspired enemy designs and repetitive puzzles.Score: 9/10

Game Informer,"In gruff moments of fatherly instruction, Kratos repeats the phrase “be better” to his son, Atreus. This happens in different contexts, but the lesson remains consistent: Your decisions are not bound by precedent, and the choices of others are not examples to follow – they only set standards you can strive to exceed. In developing the latest God of War, Sony’s Santa Monica studio apparently took this message to heart. While previous games in this series established a successful formula of stylish action and epic setpieces, the team used this opportunity to be better; with surprising changes on every front, God of War forges a new identity and surpasses even its most acclaimed predecessors.As a longtime fan of the series, this entry captivated me for completely different reasons. The narrative is one of them, despite its simple premise: Kratos and Atreus need to reach the top of the highest mountain in the Norse domain. They encounter detours and surprises along the way, but the precise story beats are less important than how they are conveyed. God of War brilliantly presents a desolate journey in a gorgeous world, all through the lens of the relationship between a distant father and his eager son.The interactions of Kratos and Atreus range from adversarial to compassionate, and these exchanges have ample room to breathe and draw players in. Atreus wonders what he might say to his departed mother if given the chance – an exercise Kratos finds pointless. When Kratos artlessly paraphrases the fable of the tortoise and the hare, Atreus mocks his lack of storytelling prowess. These quiet moments are interesting, slowly and believably closing the distance between two characters – a focus that contrasts sharply with previous games. In terse responses and long silences, Kratos conveys more than he ever did cursing Olympus at the top of his lungs.That isn’t to say God of War has sacrificed its ability to deliver incredible spectacle. An early encounter (against a mysterious enemy called the Stranger) sets the bar absurdly high, and a cathartic sequence later on stands out as my favorite moment in the series to date. Between those points and beyond, the adventure is punctuated by a steady flow of enormous beasts, ancient architecture, and intense boss fights. The environments and characters look fantastic, and a new cinematic camera angle brings you close the action and never cuts away – a decision that proves immensely rewarding during big moments by giving you an intimate view. Despite this more grounded approach to presentation, the action’s scope and ambition is stunning in cutscenes and combat alike.The Greek world may be gone, but Kratos is still a god of war, and his skill on the battlefield is appropriately divine. He fires off magic attacks and performs brutal executions in his attempts to defeat a clever assortment of foes from Norse myth. The ice-infused axe Leviathan is a drastic departure from the iconic Blades of Chaos Kratos once wielded, but it is a well-balanced and entertaining tool of destruction. I like how it emphasizes a more calculated style of combat; instead of zoomed-out, combo-driven encounters, Leviathan makes you a tactician. You can’t cut through huge swaths of enemies with it, so you need to consider how to manage your foes. You can freeze one from afar by throwing your axe, then use your fists to stun and grab another, then recall Leviathan for an area-of-effect ice burst. This kind of strategy gives many fights – especially one-on-one bosses – an engaging duel-like quality. Plus, the “thunk” of Leviathan magically flying back into Kratos’ hand is satisfying every time.During the first few hours, I had doubts about the axe-and-shield emphasis. In those opening segments, crowded melees are difficult to navigate due to off-screen attacks, which encouraged me to keep my distance – at least until I got more comfortable with key mechanics like parrying. After that, I quickly came around; the combat system’s gradual unfolding in God of War is a joy. Though it may feel restrictive at first, before long you are rapidly alternating between all the tools and skills at your disposal, including your fists, Spartan Rage, Leviathan, and more. Cooldown-regulated runic attacks provide a diverse and unique array of special moves, like a freezing beam or a stunning blast, and I had fun experimenting with them and seeing which ones I wanted to cycle into my regular rotation.You spend experience to unlock cool new techniques, and they aren’t just damage or range improvements; several have a significant impact on your options, like Kratos assuming a secondary stance from which additional attacks are possible. I also leaned on Atreus for assistance, since his arrows are crucial for incapacitating many creatures. Some of these concepts are introduced too slowly, but on the other hand, I relished how God of War’s battles avoid stagnation through constant evolution.Underlying all of your combat endeavors is a surprisingly involved gear system that gives you an avenue to customize your arsenal, but also dangles aspirational goals in front of you. Many of your deeds provide materials and equipment as rewards, and like an RPG, you see the numbers next to your stats increase as you build and equip new items. You also see materials you don’t have for pieces of gear you want to craft, which adds to the excitement when that item finally drops after finishing a sidequest or beating a tough foe. This layer of upgrading may be less exciting than learning new moves to chop up monsters, but it still provides a powerful incentive to explore.While not strictly open-world, the game has a large lake with various shores and islands available for free exploration. I loved systematically checking out new locations and acquiring crafting materials, enchantments, and other rewards. These excursions are largely optional, but they are the best way to ensure that you have everything you need for equipment upkeep. As a bonus, these diversions flesh out the world with some interesting NPCs, in addition to offering some fun (but not too challenging) puzzle-like scenarios. They can provide a nice break from the main story, but they’re always available, so you don’t need to invest in them at the expense of the narrative pacing.God of War’s momentum rarely falters, and when it does, the inconvenience is brief. For example, you have the freedom to explore, but the map isn’t especially helpful for tracking your position relative to the things you are interested in, and the fast-travel system is weirdly cumbersome and opens up too late. This is more frustrating if you plan on being thorough with collectibles and post-game objectives (no new game+ this time around), but that didn’t dampen my enthusiasm for climbing cliffs and delving into ruins long after the 30 hours I spent finishing the main story.Years ago, Kratos killed the deities of Mount Olympus in a gory rampage. Now, in the Norse realm, he has remade himself into a different kind of god. He is quieter and more deliberate, affected by his history but not constrained by it. Kratos’ reinvention serves as a narrative hook, but it also parallels the series’ evolution as a whole; where God of War once relied on bombast and bloodlust, now it leaves space for strategy and nuance. It still has superb action and plenty of jaw-dropping moments, but it supports them with a new level of depth and maturity. God of War learns from its past while clearing an exciting path for the future, and emerges as one of the best games of this generation.

   on January 12, 2022 at 8:00AM PSTThis review has been updated to include impressions of God of War's PC version, released in 2022. The initial review, written by Peter Brown in 2018, follows. The new text, written by Phil Hornshaw in 2022, has been added at the bottom of the original review.The God of War series has, until now, stuck very close to the standards set in the original 2005 game. More than a decade (and many games) later, it makes sense that Sony would want to mix things up for the aged hack-and-slash series. Like so many popular franchises that have reinvented themselves in recent years, the new God of War dips into the well of open-world RPG tropes. It also shifts its focus to Norse mythology, casting off the iconic Greek gods and legends that provided the basis for every previous game.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: God Of War Video ReviewThese major shifts don't signal the end of God of War as we know it, rather they allow the series' DNA to express itself in new ways. There are many reasons why the structural transformations are a good thing, but it's what's become of Kratos, the hulking death machine, that leaves a lasting impression. A furious, bloodthirsty icon has transformed into a sensitive father figure. Part of him retains the old violent tendencies that made him a star long ago. However, with his young son Atreus to protect and guide, we also see Kratos take a deep breath and bury his savage instincts in order to set a positive example.Watching Kratos take care in nurturing his child's sensibilities does feel a bit jarring at the start, but thanks to the natural writing, fitting voice actors, and flawless animation, it's easy to get sucked into the duo's journey and buy into their mutual growth. Though he is a teacher, Kratos carries a mountain of grief and self-pity that only the innocence of his son can help him overcome. And Atreus experiences his own ups and downs that might have set him down a very different path if not for Kratos' guiding hand.Atreus was raised in isolation from the dangers of the wild world around him, and rightfully fails to grasp his place in it when confronted with the realities of a land protected by and under siege from gods. It's the death of his mother prior to the start of the game that thrusts Atreus and Kratos outward; her dying wish was to have her ashes spread atop the highest peak in the land. As if wild predators and ghastly fiends weren't obstacles enough, representatives from the pantheon of Norse mythology arise in an attempt to disrupt their mission, establishing the amplified stakes and the clash of impressive forces that you expect from God of War.And like its predecessors, God of War is a technical and artistic showcase. It is without a doubt one of the best-looking console games ever released, with every breathtaking environment and mythical character exhibiting impressive attention to detail and beautifying flourishes aplenty. The vision behind all of this is evident in Kratos' meticulously grizzled physique and weathered equipment, in the atmospheric effects that transform believably rustic environments into the stuff of dreams, and in the overall design and structure of the world itself.The majority of the journey is set in the realm of Midgard. At its heart lies a wide lake that you can explore by canoe, with a coastline dotted by optional puzzles, formidable opponents, and entrances to the map's primary regions. Your mission will carry you through to most of these places, and along the way you'll likely take note of inaccessible pathways and glimpses of sealed treasures. There's always ample room to explore off the main path and good reasons to give into curiosity regardless, but these teases in particular spur you to re-examine previously visited areas as your capabilities expand.With the boy fighting by your side, firing arrows or choking unsuspecting enemies, you will team up against corrupted cave trolls, face towering beasts, and fight hundreds of intelligent supernatural warriors during your travels. Kratos prefers to use an axe these days, which functions very differently than the chained Blades of Chaos he's known for. This comes with the very satisfying and cool ability to magically summon your weapon to your hand (like Thor and his hammer), a move that never gets old.And really, neither does combat in general. The new over-the-shoulder camera brings you directly into the fray, and consequently limits your view. You can't see enemies from all angles at once and must be on guard at all times. By default the game provides proximity icons to alert you of incoming attacks, but it's worth tinkering with the UI for a more immersive experience as you get the hang of how fights flow.It's rare that you can actually spam combos without putting yourself at risk, and this emphasis on mindfulness solidifies God of War's graduation from the traditional hack-and-slash doldrums. The realities of fighting with an axe also makes skirting away from harm an exacting process. But when variables align and you get to lay into an enemy, Kratos' dexterous axe handling allow him to hit hard, and give you the opportunity to flex his might with a bit of style.The basic set of close-range combos and weapon behaviors can be expanded by pouring experience points into a skill tree and by activating magical rune abilities that bind to your two attack inputs. There are a lot of options to consider and tactics to learn, including skill trees for fighting empty-handed. There's a wonderful rhythm to be found when switching from axe to fists, and then into Kratos' satisfyingly brutal execution moves, all the while ducking and rolling out of harm's way.God of War's combat is already great at the start, but it gets better as it steadily introduces one new layer after another. You can absolutely stumble into incredibly punishing enemies that are made easier with adept timing and mastery of every available skill, but you can also succeed at any level so long as you've mastered the art of parrying and dodging incoming attacks.Atreus can't be configured to the same extent that Kratos can, but there are still a lot of ways to tailor his capabilities to your liking. The arrows he fires can be laced with different types of magic, with multiple elemental and functionality upgrades, and he eventually gains the ability to summon spectral animals that can harm and distract enemies, or collect items. Thanks to the smart button layout, it's actually very easy to both attack and defend as Kratos while also commanding Atreus. God of War gives you plenty to do in any given moment and makes you feel like an experienced warrior in the process.The armor that Kratos and Atreus wear can influence a range of character stats, elemental affinities, and may include slots for enchantments that grant further bonuses. Armor can be purchased or crafted using the few resources scattered about the world, and can be upgraded by the game's two blacksmiths: two dwarven brothers constantly at odds with each other. There's Brok, the foul-mouthed blue dwarf, and Sindri, a far more gentle yet tragically germophobic fellow--a gag that is usually funny, though occasionally pushed a bit too hard.As enjoyable as those two can be, it's Mimir that ultimately steals the show. The horned, one-eyed sage accompanies you and Atreus for the majority of the game, serving as your guide to Midgard, and an inside source into the ins and outs of Norse politics. Mimir and the blacksmiths have strong individual personalities, as with every other character you meet during the course of the game. We're keeping other identities vague in general to avoid spoilers, but regardless of who you bump into, God of War's cast is strong, convincing, and oddly enchanting. But the real accomplishment is how, even though there are just a handful of characters to interact with, their big personalities color your adventure with tantalizing anecdotes that draw you into the world and imbue the land with a tangible sense of history.If there's any piece of the overarching mission that feels like a letdown, it's the final battle against the primary antagonist. He's great from a narrative standpoint, unraveling in a manner that changes your perspective, but it's the fight itself that leaves you wanting. There are plenty of big boss battles and tests of skill throughout the course of the game, yet this fight doesn't reach the same heights, and feels like it was played a little safe. It could be an effect of configuring Kratos and Atreus just so, or it may just be too easy to begin with. Thankfully, that's not all the game has up its sleeve.Two optional areas in particular seem designed with the endgame in mind. The first, Muspelheim, offers a series of battles in arenas surrounded by lava flows and scorched earth. Some trials are merely fights against strong enemies, while others require you to defeat waves in quick succession--if even one enemy remains alive, it only takes a few seconds for others to resurrect automatically. The other realm, Niflheim, is randomly generated every time you visit, but it's always filled with poisonous gas. The goal there is to survive for as long as possible while racking up kills and collecting treasure, and escape before the poison takes hold. Both locations offer tense and rewarding pursuits that are only accessible if you play at your best.And odds are that you'll be so hooked by the story's pacing and procession of events that there will be plenty of other side activities left in Midgard after the credits roll. God of War isn't set in a massive open world, but it is stuffed with secrets and quests. Where most games with long and diverse quest opportunities tend to run a bit stale by the end, God of War has the opposite effect. It's far longer than it needs to be, though you hope you never run out of things to do.In many ways God of War is what the series has always been. It's a spectacular action game with epic set pieces, big-budget production values, and hard-hitting combat that grows more feverish and impressive as you progress. What may surprise you is how mature its storytelling has become. Like Kratos, God of War recalls the past while acknowledging the need to improve. Everything new it does is for the better, and everything it holds onto benefits as a result. Kratos is no longer a predictable brute. God of War is no longer an old-fashioned action series. With this reboot, it confidently walks a new path that will hopefully lead to more exciting adventures to come.Nearly four years after its initial release, God of War has finally made its way to PC. If you haven't yet checked out Sony Santa Monica's lengthy tale of Mad Dad Kratos and Boy, the PC version is the one you should grab. It doesn't bring any new content to the table, but it does offer graphical options that make an already beautiful game look even better.The PC version of God of War supports 4k resolution and unlocked framerates, DLSS and ultrawide displays, as well as some more granular options for tweaking the look of the game, like turning up the resolution of textures or enhancing the appearance of shadows. Probably the most notable improvement is the unlocked framerate, which makes for some buttery smooth moments of Kratos slamming the Leviathan Axe into draugr and trolls. God of War ran at 30fps on PlayStation 4, so if this is your first time playing or revisiting the game since then (without, say, the upgrade to its PlayStation 5 version), the higher framerate is a nice step forward for a game that's all about slick animations and the flow state of building devastating combos. Generally, though, God of War was a very pretty game even in its PS4 incarnation, and it remains a very pretty game here, whether you're turning up the graphics and framerate or not. Apart from the amped-up graphical capabilities, the other main upgrade in the PC version is customization. You can do a lot to mess with the game's graphics, heads-up display, and camera controls to make God of War play the way you want. Like other PC games, God of War also supports a variety of control setups--while PlayStation players are limited to using the DualShock or DualSense, you're not locked into those on PC. I played almost exclusively with an Xbox gamepad, and it felt just as natural as if the game had been made to play on the platform from the start. While you can't remap gamepad controls, everything can be customized if you're playing with a mouse and keyboard for even more opportunities to adjust how the game feels.God of War isn't drastically different on PC when compared to the PS4 version that launched back in 2018, but its little improvements are definitely nice ones, making this a solid PC port overall. There isn't reason enough here to buy a second copy of the game if you've already played, necessarily, but the PC version is a great reason to check out God of War for the first time for anybody who hasn't had a chance to experience it. God of War remains an excellent, gorgeous, affecting action game, and with the port to PC, it gets a handful of nice, if somewhat minor, improvements.God Of War is featured as one of the best PS5 games.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"
Polygon,"Filed under:Before Ragnarok later this year, God of War finally comes to a new audience2018’s God of War is one of the best games ever made. And with its move to Windows PC nearly four years after launch, it’s managed to get even better.God of War surprised players with the ways in which it matured the series — like making Kratos a character people care about rather than an unrepentant bastard, and doing away with the extreme objectification of female characters. But as much as developer Sony Santa Monica focused on building a new legacy, it didn’t do away with the past completely.God of War picks up years after Kratos’ adventures through Greece, where he slew the entire pantheon of Olympian gods. Now he’s a father, again, and he’s trying to pull his son, Atreus, in a different direction, to help Atreus avoid some of the cruel mistakes Kratos made in his previous lives on PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3.Polygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences. When we award the Polygon Recommends badge, it’s because we believe the recipient is uniquely thought-provoking, entertaining, inventive, or fun — and worth fitting into your schedule. If you want curated lists of our favorite media, check out What to Play and What to Watch.It’s still a series about rage, but instead of focusing on the youthful frustrations of the past, it offers a more mature take. Fear is the new heart at the center of Kratos’ fury — fear that Kratos’ past will never let him be at peace, that his son will discover who he truly is, and that he’s too broken to ever be the father he needs to be. And of course, fear fuels a new rogues’ gallery of enemies — the Norse gods — who are all fighting to stave off the end of the world. God of War wraps a beautiful story into a tight third-person action and puzzle game. It demonstrates a fervid appreciation for Norse myths in the way it makes these gods into compelling characters. It takes RPG systems, narrative-based exploration, unique weapons, and storytelling tricks from different kinds of games, and melds them all together perfectly. It’s a marvel of modern game design, but it’s been shackled to PlayStation for years, limiting both its technical potential as well as the number of people who can experience it.With this PC release, Sony has not only brought an excellent game to masses of PC players; it has also given God of War a second life as a visual feast. The original release looked great in 2018 on PlayStation 4, and in 2021 on PlayStation 5. But in 2022, God of War looks downright gorgeous on PC.On ultra settings, God of War runs smoothly at 120 frames per second in 1080p  resolution on my PC. (I’m rocking an Nvidia RTX 3080 with a Core i7-10700K processor at 3.80 GHz and 32 GB of RAM.) The melted innards of Draugr splinter apart with a crack when Kratos rips the creatures open, spewing orange viscera everywhere. During emotional moments, the subtle twitches of Kratos’ face betray his thoughts beautifully. And during close-up shots, I can count the individual gray hairs in his beautifully detailed beard.

  Nothing compares to playing a game like God of War for the first time, seeing the way the water rushes out of the Lake of Nine as Jörmungandr, the World Serpent, rises from beneath the waves. But when the giant snake opened his mouth, and his voice bellowed through my headphones, I was even more awestruck by his design — his 4-year-old model and textures look excellent, even with my face just inches away from the monitor. The water dripping off of his mossy beard, the shadows in his nostrils, and his throat wavering while he speaks — it all looks better than ever. It’s the same game, but with its already impressive sets and visuals turned up, creating an even more immersive experience.But my beautiful PC playthrough wasn’t without some hiccups. On rare occasions, I experienced minor screen tearing during quick turns. Kratos’ armor also occasionally clips through his body or objects. The enhanced visuals make the 2018 level of detail on certain textures — like a rare kind of chest, made of a bright gold — more noticeable, with the game’s improved shadows seemingly not pulling the same weight on brighter textures. But those blemishes were the exception to the rule, thrown into contrast by the beauty seen everywhere else in the game. The excellent visuals and smooth performance of the PC version is something I’d hoped for — a way to see this excellent game in a new light, not constrained by my PS4 that was just a few years away from being benched for a PS5. God of War is an exciting addition to anyone’s Steam or Epic Games Store library because it looks beautiful and runs almost perfectly, but there’s another reason to be glad about its jump to PC: A legion of new players will get to experience Sony Santa Monica’s magnum opus for the first time.With Sony’s recent move to get some of its exclusive titles (Horizon Zero Dawn, Ghost of Tsushima, Days Gone) into the hands of PC players, it’s opening itself up to an even wider fan base. Sure, some of those players might buy a console to check out God of War Ragnarok later this year, but that’s not the point. God of War is my go-to example of how mechanics and storytelling can combine to create something distinct from other mediums, a game I recommend to nongamer friends and family all the time (with a high degree of success). It was always a bummer that it took buying into a single console ecosystem to experience this game, and now, it doesn’t.God of War on PC is more than just a great visual upgrade for an already stunning game. It’s the best version of one of the best games ever made, perfect for replays and first run-throughs alike. God of War will be released Jan. 14 on Windows PC.

   on January 12, 2022 at 8:00AM PSTThis review has been updated to include impressions of God of War's PC version, released in 2022. The initial review, written by Peter Brown in 2018, follows. The new text, written by Phil Hornshaw in 2022, has been added at the bottom of the original review.The God of War series has, until now, stuck very close to the standards set in the original 2005 game. More than a decade (and many games) later, it makes sense that Sony would want to mix things up for the aged hack-and-slash series. Like so many popular franchises that have reinvented themselves in recent years, the new God of War dips into the well of open-world RPG tropes. It also shifts its focus to Norse mythology, casting off the iconic Greek gods and legends that provided the basis for every previous game.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

There are many reasons why the structural transformations are a good thing, but it's what's become of Kratos, the hulking death machine, that leaves a lasting impression. A furious, bloodthirsty icon has transformed into a sensitive father figure. Part of him retains the old violent tendencies that made him a star long ago. However, with his young son Atreus to protect and guide, we also see Kratos take a deep breath and bury his savage instincts in order to set a positive example.Watching Kratos take care in nurturing his child's sensibilities does feel a bit jarring at the start, but thanks to the natural writing, fitting voice actors, and flawless animation, it's easy to get sucked into the duo's journey and buy into their mutual growth. Though he is a teacher, Kratos carries a mountain of grief and self-pity that only the innocence of his son can help him overcome. And Atreus experiences his own ups and downs that might have set him down a very different path if not for Kratos' guiding hand.Atreus was raised in isolation from the dangers of the wild world around him, and rightfully fails to grasp his place in it when confronted with the realities of a land protected by and under siege from gods. It's the death of his mother prior to the start of the game that thrusts Atreus and Kratos outward; her dying wish was to have her ashes spread atop the highest peak in the land.

Polygon,"Filed under:Dream daddyAbout midway through God of War, Kratos and his son Atreus sit in a canoe in the middle of a lake, listening intently to a disembodied head recount the tawdry and tragic dramas of the Norse gods. The head dishes with the gusto of a gossip columnist and the smoothness of a public radio host. Kratos and son show the orator respect, only interrupting with the occasional question for clarification. That this serene moment doesn’t ring false, let alone veer into tedium, speaks to the tremendous heavy lifting done by the creators of God of War to shift the tone, the style and the expectations of one of the most beloved but also most violent and debaucherous franchises in modern games.Last we saw Kratos, he still enjoyed getting hammered on a bottle of red, participating in a well-lit orgy and slaying Greek gods in ways that a teenager might storyboard onto the back of a ruled notebook. He and his franchise thrived on adrenaline, any inner turmoil serving as a springboard for ultraviolence, rather than an emotional well to be drawn from. Times change, and the new God of War, part sequel (the story continues from where it left off) and part reboot (the adventure is slower and the characterization more thoughtful), has more heroic ambitions for the notorious antihero.Polygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences.

If you want curated lists of our favorite media, check out What to Play and What to Watch.Kratos is a parent now, older, calmer and from what I can tell, into the tiny home fad. He’s taken part in an ancient form of witness protection by moving north and living in a modest cabin in the forests of the Norse realm of Midgard. Kratos is, however, no less a magnet for domestic tragedy. His second wife, the mother to his son Atreus, has just died and been cremated. And so, this particular adventure, at the outset at least, has Kratos and his tween on a quest to fulfill her final wish: that her ashes be carried to the highest peak in the realm. (Yes, the game kicks off with a spin on the “woman in the fridge,” but mercifully, things become more complicated as the story unpacks itself.)The gods and the past get in the way of good intentions, and rather quickly, Kratos and his son find themselves vivisecting undead soldiers, elves, trolls, ancients, and a number of other mythological creatures with silly names and even siller characteristics (e.g., the tatzelwurm, a poison-spitting, tunnel-burrowing walrus-tiger hybrid). Thank goodness. For all the changes to tone and ethos, this is still a God of War game, and you can feel that in the joy of the combat. Kratos doesn’t punch; he pulverizes. He moves like a boxer, shoulders set, legs grapevining back and forth. The way his ax zips into an enemy’s skull, then back to his hand, is so smooth and natural that it’s easy to overlook how challenging it must have been to animate such a thing. (Fortunately, animation director Kristjan Zadziuk explains how the developers likely did it in this YouTube video.)In the early hours, God of War feels, if not like a follow-up to the original game, then a creative revamping. As the 2005 God of War took the individual great combat ideas from its time and blended them together, so does the new God of War for a new era. But the game doesn’t set into any style for too long. Without warning, the linear adventure, focused on fights and dramatic showdowns, bursts wide open, and the preset paths of past entries give way to a new, grand hub, its spokes taking the crew far beyond Midgard. The main objective must be attended to, sure, but not now, not necessarily. Kratos’ goal has weight, but the world isn’t literally rotating around his every decision — an increasingly common and welcome change in AAA blockbusters. This relaxed pace frees you to explore, and it frees Kratos to focus more on parenting than on saving the planet. On more than one occasion, he threatens a bratty Atreus that he will turn this canoe around and head straight back home, and it feels like he might actually do it.In this way, the game has less in common with Homer’s epic Odyssey than with last year’s memoir An Odyssey by Daniel Mendelsohn, which serves as a rich, therapeutic and exploratory look at the author’s relationship with his father through the lens of the classical text. And like that book, God of War does it with wit and grace. The dialogue doesn’t put on a faux-Shakespearean haughtiness. Atreus talks like a kid, sweet and also selfish. And Kratos acts, in turn, like a father who has no clue how to be a parent, and yet feels a profound need to protect this boy from the world and his own bloodline. God of War is awesome at times, in the true sense of the word, but its heart lives in the small ways this man and this boy are building and unbuilding their relationship. All of which is to say that the game is relaxed to the point of bordering on indifferent. Many of God of War’s most interesting surprises are optional, branching from the game’s sturdy throughline: secret rooms giving way to hidden caverns winding to towering statues or belligerent dragons — which I would have missed altogether had I just followed my compass to the next objective. You don’t find collectibles; you find entire chunks of story tucked behind a mossy wall or under a tropical island. God of War, like last year’s Nier: Automata and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, rewards the player who inspects its immaculately designed world as if it were a hidden object game. Also optional are the spoken tales I mentioned earlier, the ones told by the disembodied head. Whenever you step from the canoe onto dry land, the head hushes up, and like a courteous tour guide, promises to eventually pick up his yarns where he left off. I got the most enjoyment from letting him finish, though. This applies to everybody Kratos meets during the journey. I encourage you to hang in the water. Lounge around the shops. Don’t rush into battle when characters are speaking to you. Set down the controller, take in the scenery and listen to what they have to say.By journey’s end, of course, the fate of the world is at play — baby, bathwater — at which point God of War is thoroughly spiced with the gristle of Game of Thrones. Ice zombies, a skeuomorphic tabletop map, some occasionally stilted dialogue about the history of powerful family legacies that had hitherto been mentioned only in passing. The game’s one glaring weakness is this occasional mimicry of the iconography established by George R.R. Martin and his fantasy forebears. The art design excels when it tries something different, such as the buglike dark elves and ghastly white elves, neither of which look like elvish cliches.The rare riff on other fantasy epics would be more bothersome if the game didn’t so confidently hold its own alongside its contemporaries when it comes to sheer scale. I’m hesitant to call the biggest moments in God of War setpieces, since they don’t operate in the fashion setpieces normally would. Some involve heavily choreographed fights and gargantuan explosions. Others, however, make Kratos a diminutive object in the frame, like when he’s dwarfed by a sea serpent that, coiled, must be the size of a small city. One of the most memorable moments has Kratos (with the player maintaining control) parting a lake, creating long chasms of waterfalls that extend into the horizon. No blood or guts, just beauty.These visuals don’t boil down to glorified matte paintings. Unlike in other action games, where spectacle happens around the hero while they fight inside a controlled arena, Kratos and Atreus step into these dense backgrounds. That massive lane in the lake becomes a pathway to an elven kingdom, filled with fights and puzzles. The giant serpent rests languidly around the world’s central hub. And the camera never cuts away. There are no load screens. From the opening frame, through the credits and beyond, the camera lingers behind Kratos, the story proceeding in real time. God of War takes place in one shot.The unedited long take is a bit stress-inducing, at least at first, like watching a movie and not being allowed to blink. But as the game established its more chill pace, I appreciated the refusal to cut away from Kratos and company. I felt more like a participant in the world, rather than someone watching the adventure from outside it. As a technical achievement, the single shot is mind-bending, a never-ending “how did they pull this off?” Open-world sequences seamlessly transition into cinematic showdowns into lengthy trips in the canoe — without a stutter. Because the game can’t cut away, or skip ahead in time or space, you must follow Kratos on every step from one location to the next. As a result of the decision, the world is big and condensed all at the same time. There’s a lot to see, but God of War’s designers have been creative in how they minimize backtracking. Generally, you can see where you’re going or where you came from, as paths through castles and cliffsides have you doubling back, creating shortcuts or secret passages back to the main route. (You eventually gain access to a tool that makes travel simpler and faster, all without breaking the game’s single long camera take. It’s neat.)It sounds Dark Souls-ish because it is Dark Souls-ish. That comparison extends to the combat, which — especially in the extremely difficult postgame content — does a good (if imperfect) impression of everybody’s favorite masocore series. Borrowed inspiration isn’t limited to the Souls franchise. Fights involve an unusual but effective hodgepodge of genres: Ax melee attacks handle like an old-fashioned beat-’em-up; ax throws work like a sniper rifle, the weapon returning to Kratos with the tap of a button; Atreus (whom you can command to fire arrows) behaves almost like an RPG party member, flanking large enemies and stunning packs into position for attacks.In fact, God of War takes a good deal from role-playing games. Gear can be purchased or found, then upgraded or modified, to increase Kratos’ status, which is displayed on the pause screen like a tabletop character sheet. The ax, the shield and the bow have upgrade trees. Kratos’ fanciest attacks are called runics, and you assign one light and one heavy runic attack at a time. Runic attacks replace complex combos, and are performed with a simple tap of the shoulder buttons. No pressure to master reflexes and motor skills. Instead, precious brain juice can be spent on strategy: Does a zone call for attacks that stun large groups of enemies, setting up a sequence of brutal takedowns, or does a big boss warrant narrow but powerful damage-dealing blows? Tough battles are made easy when treated like puzzles to be solved with the right combat approach.None of this is explicitly clarified by the game, nor does it need to be. You won’t see tutorials, just small reminders of which button corresponds to which move. God of War embraces a certain degree of ambiguity, freeing the player to discover their own methods, and tackle the journey how they see fit. Same goes for the story. Kratos and Atreus’ quest takes them in and out of the dramas of other people and kingdoms, and their involvement isn’t clearly rationalized as good or bad. Early in the game, Kratos tells Atreus a tale of sailors who drank seawater and believed they heard the call of their families, the voices both pleasing them and driving them mad. It’s a brief moment, but it subtly establishes a distrust of one’s perception that’s reflected and refracted by the central storyline.This ambiguity works because it’s intentional, not a byproduct of poor storytelling. Even small details pay off. Brief anecdotes parallel core themes. Seemingly inconsequential decisions have major repercussions. Like the game’s world, the story folds in on itself, inviting you to re-examine where you’ve been and reconsider where you’re going. There’s a musicality to the structure: The central hub that Kratos and Atreus visit between adventures acts like a chorus, with each spoke of their journey its own verse. Atreus and other characters gently guide the player toward priorities, though they just as often mention a bundle of side quests that are just as worthy of your time. Simple chatter usually has a purpose, either moving the story forward, or nudging you, wittingly or unwittingly, in a new direction.I’ll skip spoilers and specifics, but even core mechanical design choices, things that seem gamey and intangible, are given narrative purpose by the end. God of War is, in a single word, holistic. Every aspect is excellent on its own, but more importantly, it all serves and accentuates the larger vision.A decade ago, director Cory Barlog helped establish the God of War franchise as an iconic gory and debaucherous video game romp. While its antihero, Kratos, had pathos (he killed his wife and daughter in a fit of rage, his skin forever grayed by their ashes), it served little dramatic purpose, rather existing as a grimdark excuse for his god-slaying and orgy-having ways. Barlog — now older, a father — has returned to the series with a small army of talented designers, many of whom served on the earlier games, to make good on that rich but neglected potential at the francises’ core. There’s still plenty of gore, but now the guts have meatiness. Some die-hard fans may fear this isn’t really God of War. I suppose they’re right. It’s even better. God of War was reviewed using a final “retail” PlayStation 4 download code provided by Sony. You can find additional information about Polygon’s ethics policy here. The game was played on a PS4 Pro on Performance mode. For PS4 Pro users, God of War offers a display mode with 4K resolution, but it had frame-rate issues in our tests. The game was also tested by the Polygon team on a standard PS4 and exhibited no major performance issues. Screenshots were captured on both PS4 Pro and standard PS4 in 1080p resolution.Please check your email to find a confirmation email, and follow the steps to confirm your humanity.Oops.

Not due to quality issues (that year’s God of War III and Ghost of Sparta were critically acclaimed), but because it seemed that there was no place else to go. Kratos’ quest for revenge had led him on a rampage through the pantheon of Greek gods and culminated with the death of his father Zeus. We had performed hundreds of QTEs, killed dozens of gods in the grisliest of manners, and heard plenty of angry Kratos screams. We were done.When Ascension was announced a few years later, you could almost hear the collective groan from the gaming world. It was yet another prequel, it didn’t introduce much in the way of new gameplay, and Sony confusingly led its marketing with a multiplayer mode that no one was asking for. It wasn’t a trainwreck of a game, but it was far from eventful and didn’t necessitate the return of the neatly tied-up series.At E3 2016, we saw our first glimpse of yet another return to God of War. Unlike Ascension, this reveal felt like far more of a departure from the franchise’s past. Kratos wasn’t screaming at the heavens or tearing a minotaur’s horn off and using it to disembowel him. Rather, the nearly ten-minute trailer focused more on dialogue between the protagonist and an as-yet-unknown son.I was excited about the prospect of taking God of War in a new direction, but I also wondered if I’d enjoy it as much. I had always loved the over-the-top brutality in the same way that I enjoyed Mortal Kombat’s cartoonish fatalities. My favorite moments included beating Zeus to death until the screen was covered in blood, tearing the massive fingernail off of a titan, and in perhaps my favorite moment in the series, slamming a metal door onto the head of Theseus for way too long. God of War was a hilarious, over-the-top, violent revenge story, and I loved it for that. I worried that a more “mature” take on the series would be like remaking Commando with an emphasis on the relationship between Col. Matrix and Jenny instead of an emphasis on rowing a boat up to an island and killing tons of bad guys.Of course, God of War wouldn’t have seen the massive success it enjoyed if it were based solely on blood and guts. Rock-solid gameplay ensured that it was more than a one-trick pony, so I hoped this PS4 reboot would satisfy on the gameplay front even if the “screaming and killing” tone had changed.The games of the original trilogy began by impaling the head of a Hydra on the mast of a ship, destroying a rampaging colossus from the inside, and poking out Poseidon’s eyes and throwing him off a cliff. By contrast, Kratos spends most of his time in the early hours of the new game by chatting with his young son. Compared to the seemingly intentional lack of nuance in the series’ past, it’s handled extremely well this time around. Kratos is no longer a screaming avatar of rage that expresses himself via quicktime event. He’s older and sadder, with a quest of fulfilling a loved one’s dying wish instead of exacting vengeance on every god that crosses his path.At the outset, he seems to be simultaneously preparing his son Atreus for a life as a warrior while also trying to steer him away from the path he took for himself. He’s harsh and humorless in the face of Atreus’ childlike playfulness and inquisitive nature. If the topic of conversation isn’t about focusing in combat or removing emotion from killing, Kratos seems to have no time for it.If this were the tone for the entire game, it could quickly become tiresome. Thankfully, this new world (set in Nordic mythology for the first time) is populated with plenty of characters that aren’t amused or intimidated by Kratos’ gruffness. There are several new characters (including Atreus) who call him out on his attitude or poke fun at how much of a ridiculous grump he is, and he never really seems to know how to respond.We spend several hours getting accustomed to the new world, characters, mythology, and father/son dynamic. These hours aren’t without the occasional skirmish, so you’ll also have some time to get accustomed to the new over-the-shoulder camera and completely overhauled combat system. The new perspective and Kratos’ Leviathan axe instantly feel more deliberate than the iconic, crowd-clearing Blades of Chaos. Your abilities are limited in use early on, with little to do other than light and heavy swings, bare-handed attacks, blocking with your shield, throwing the axe (with a boomerang-like return), and commanding Atreus to fire his bow in the general direction of the camera’s view.Combat has changed in more fundamental ways than “it’s over-the-shoulder and you have a kid now.” Rather than the face button-centric combat of the past, the majority of attacks are now handled via some combination of the triggers. Instead of a directional evade controlled by the right analog stick, you can now block (or parry) with L1 or roll out of the way by double-tapping X. It takes some time to get used to and I found myself messing up for many hours before I acclimated myself to the new system. Once everything clicks into place and you’ve earned some upgrades, combat feels as intense and responsive as ever.I felt limited in my axe attacks in the early hours, but your combat capabilities continuously evolve over the course of the game. By the end, I was utilizing my weapons, bare-handed techniques, two special Runic attacks, a talisman ability, a rage meter, tons of unlocked combos, and numerous Atreus abilities to control and defeat large groups of enemies. Once you know what you’re doing and you have plenty of moves at your disposal, combat becomes more satisfying than the mash-friendly encounters of the past.Atreus is just as critical to combat as he is to the game’s story. You can use him to pull enemy attention and deal damage via his arrow attacks, and it never feels like he’s in the way or requires babysitting. It’s an even-better implementation of a companion than Ellie in The Last of Us. While she didn’t require a lot of protection either, she’d sometimes break immersion by running around in plain sight during a stealth sequence. That isn’t an issue in God of War, as Atreus fits in perfectly at all times, whether it’s a combat encounter or a father/son chat while rowing across the Lake of Nine.Hopping into that boat with Atreus is the first real taste of just how open and different the format is this time around. Previous God of War titles were strictly linear, with only the occasional branch off the main path (almost always to find a hidden chest). A story objective is clearly marked once you reach the lake, but it’s immediately clear that you’re free to explore at your leisure. The Lake of Nine almost feels like Hyrule Field in a 3D Zelda game, serving as a central hub that connects a wide variety of smaller locales and challenges. Between almost every story beat, I loved sailing around to side areas to see what I could find. More often than not, my exploration would be rewarded in the form of side stories, clever puzzles, hidden collectibles, or new gear.I was initially excited about the prospect of a robust customization system in a God of War game, but it doesn’t quite work as well as I hoped. You can discover and craft a wide variety of armor, talismans, axe pommels, runes, and more, but everything from the interface to the inventory management feels a bit half-baked. New crafting materials are constantly being thrown at you (especially late in the game) with little explanation of what they’re for. A “resources” tab in the menu doesn’t always clear things up, such as when I started finding things like Symbols of Perseverance in treasure chests but no mention of them anywhere else in the game.Some materials are tied to rare enemies, so I had no idea if their supply was inherently limited or if the necessary enemies would respawn at a later time. I also found little reason to change out gear or runic abilities unless it was for a significant, obvious step up in rarity. Once I found something I liked, I’d funnel tons of materials and currency into upgrading it. I’d eventually find some new base-level gear or ability, but I’d already be so invested in whatever I was currently using that I wouldn’t want to start the process again with something that was untested.God of War’s first gear system doesn’t knock it out of the park, but it’s at least cool to see new armor represented visually on Kratos. Each element of this game’s visual design is impeccable, melding the stunning scenery the earlier titles were known for with technical brilliance that rivals the best we’ve seen from Naughty Dog. Titles like Uncharted: Lost Legacy and Horizon: Zero Dawn have made great cases for a PS4 Pro and a 4K television, but God of War’s visuals are a bigger selling point than anything I’ve seen on Sony’s platform to date. Dark caverns and blinding ethereal locations make great use of HDR, and the art design of the various environments is bound to look amazing regardless of what you’re playing on.I was excited for a new take on God of War, but I don’t think I could have expected what Sony Santa Monica pulled off with this one. Those first three games are among my favorite games of the 2000s thanks to their visceral combat, stunning environments, grand scale, satisfying upgrades, and memorable boss fights. I even loved the skin deep, silly nature of its narrative and violence. This new entry proves that it can provide all of the positive qualities of the franchise’s past while expanding on and evolving them in every conceivable way. The new combat system is excellent, the numerous puzzles are clever and rewarding, a more open format gives you plenty of reason to explore, and the entire adventure is at least three times longer than any of the original games without ever feeling padded out.Perhaps most importantly, I didn’t know how much more ground could be covered with Kratos as a character. The new Nordic mythology obviously gives Sony Santa Monica plenty of new material to play with, but it’s the new Kratos that’s responsible for the game’s most striking evolution. I’ve played through five God of War games as this character, and never saw him as much more than “the tough screamy guy that’s gonna kill all these gods in hilarious ways.” Now, I find myself just as invested in the quiet conversations Kratos has with Atreus as I do with my newest weapon upgrade. God of War grew up, and the result is the best entry in the series.© 2023 FANDOM, INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

USgamer,"There’s a scene in God of War where Kratos decapitates someone to free them from a magical cage within the mangled roots of a tree. The original games would have relished in the act, pulling the camera close for each grisly axe swing, zooming in as the tendons snap back like stretched elastic bands. In God of War 2018, the camera pans away instead, and the act itself takes just one clean cut. The pantheon-punching God of War series has always been as subtle as a demigod’s boot to the face, but this sequel has more class, more confidence than ever. It allows things to go unseen or unsaid. In one early cutscene, Kratos’s wrist bandages untangle. He stares down at the dangling cloth as his hand instinctively tries to catch some invisible hilt, grasping at nothing. There’s no flashback to explain what he is thinking - everything you need to know is right there in his face: he has left the Ghost of Sparta, and the Blades of Chaos, behind. We join Kratos in the frozen, craggy land of Norse mythology, a place ruled over by deities Odin and Thor. He did not come here to carve up the gods, however. No. He came here to start a new life - a new life as a man. The adventure begins with the funeral of Kratos’s wife, shortly before he and his son, Atreus, take a journey to the tallest peak in all the realms to scatter her ashes. Rather than kicking off with a massive boss fight - though you punch someone through a mountain within an hour - God of War 2018 begins with a slow walk. 
 
This is a story about the sins of the father - a central theme wrapped around the experience like a flaming chain and mirrored in the characters you meet. God of War has always been thematically consistent, but rage is not the sole driving force here. Kratos is still a sullen slaphead whose brain is probably made of a bicep (he punches certain chests - treasure chests, not pectorals - open for Christ’s sake). He is also still a brutally efficient murderer who moisturises his ashen skin with the blood of his foes. Kratos is just more world-weary, mindful of the consequences of his Greek revenge spree, and now he has something to lose. ""The pantheon-punching God of War series has always been as subtle as a demigod’s boot to the face, but this sequel has more class, more confidence than ever.""Just as there’s a steadfast commitment to its themes, God of War is unmoving in its style. It is filmed in a single shot, the camera dancing in and out of the action with no visible loading between areas. There is a trade-off - it means that you can never see what is happening off-screen - but it all comes together to make the journey feel more personal. You have to admire Sony Santa Monica’s devotion to such a novel artistic choice. During cutscenes that seamlessly transition between exploration and combat, the camera dollies out or becomes a drone that hovers around the action, swooping in and following the carnage. When you are in control, the camera hugs Kratos’s back, allowing you to look around freely - unlike in the older games where fixed camera angles amped up the drama of your grandiose surroundings, often reducing Kratos to a spec against the environment. If anything, the fact you have to angle the camera up to take in some of the game’s huge creatures and ornate contraptions makes everything seem grander still.  
 
Kicking a dragon in the face is just best experienced up-close, you know? As for the violence itself, combat is comfortably familiar despite the change of perspective. You have a light and heavy attack - though now they are on R1 and R2 - and you can mix them together to create combos, or pause between attacks to switch stances and perform different strikes, once unlocked. Stagger an enemy and you can perform a grisly and satisfying execution with R3. For incoming attacks, you can dodge, guard, or - with the right timing - parry. Fill up your rage meter and you go into a fury and pound your enemies to a pulp while recovering health with successful strikes. The main difference is your toolkit. Your primary weapon (others come later) is an ice axe capable of freezing enemies or mechanisms in place. Squeeze L2 and it functions like a gun in a third-person shooter, allowing you to fling it at speed and bury it into an enemy’s face or a part of the environment - this is useful in both combat and puzzles. When the axe is out of your hands, you fight with your fists, feet, and a shield. Tap triangle at any time and the axe whizzes through the air like Thor’s hammer, hitting any enemies it passes through on its return to your hand where it lands with a lovely clunk. Yes, it is as cool as it sounds. No, it never gets old. ""Sitting alongside the snappy and at times genuinely funny dialogue are the ridiculous, bombastic set-pieces you expect from a God of War game. ""Atreus also helps out in combat, grabbing enemies by the neck and holding them in place, loosing volleys of arrows at your command, or summoning spectral animals to trample on your foes. Combat isn’t as deep as some action games, but there’s a real heft to every attack as Kratos spins like a hurricane that just swept through a knife shop, and new abilities unlock at a rapid rate.  
 
As well as pulling his weight in battles, Atreus acts as a cipher for the player’s curiosity. He has spent his entire life squirrelled away in a shack in the woods, and now he’s seeing the land of Norse mythology with fresh eyes, just as you are. As you row between islands or explore on foot, the father and son pair chat (well, Kratos grunts) about your goals. Atreus is happy to go off and explore, while Kratos is concerned only with your quest and making sure Atreus doesn’t develop his father’s temper and go all dad-stabby. Other than one clumsy bit of character development in the final third, the writing is excellent. Atreus is in awe of his father, a burly baldy who can flip an entire temple upside down with his hands, while Kratos himself treats Atreus as a student, rather than a son. Their relationship matures over the 20-odd hours the main story takes to complete, and both are different people by the time the credits roll. The same goes for the supporting cast, who are trying to reconcile their own family bonds. Sitting alongside the snappy and at times genuinely funny dialogue are the ridiculous, bombastic set-pieces you expect from a God of War game. I won’t spoil them, but there are moments here that rival God of War 3’s opening scene, only now they have something to contrast against - the moments of downtime make these wonderfully choreographed action sequences and environmental oddities really stand out.  
 
God of War comes with all the trappings of a video game released in 2018, letting you loose into a small open-world, filling it with sidequests, and layering it in light RPG elements, but it’s such a beautiful, awe-inspiring landscape that even simply exploring is enjoyable. Sony Santa Monica makes great use of the space, too, opening up new areas with dropping water levels, or allowing you to discover looping shortcuts, so there always feels like there is something new to discover when you want a distraction from your main quest.Partway through the game, you get access to a teleporting machine that allows you to access other realms, opening up the world even more. My only real criticism is how that contraption promises more than it delivers. A handful of the realms are locked throughout - presumably put aside for DLC - while two of them are essentially fighting arenas, distractions where you can battle to grab legendary loot. Only two of the other realms contain a ‘proper’ new landscape to explore. Still, it’s a credit to the quality of what is there that I didn’t want to leave its world after the credits rolled and instantly headed back into the world to punch werewolves again. God of War has grown up. It is violent, but it’s not excessive. It is angry, but there is something to contrast it against. There is a flash of nipple, but it’s Kratos’s. Kratos is older, and he feels remorse for his past, but it feels like Sony Santa Monica also wants to atone. If that was God of War’s goal, the studio deserves a standing ovation. This isn’t only the best God of War game, it’s one of the best games of the current generation.

God of War has finally made it to PC, and I was pumped to give the former PlayStation exclusive another playthrough. God of War was one of my favorite games of 2018 and has continued to stick out as one of the best of the 2010s.Unfortunately, the experience was somewhat marred by the PS4’s inability to carry such a detailed game further than 30 frames per second. A patch allowed PS5 players to squeeze 60fps out of it, but there weren’t any options to increase the quality of the visuals. It wasn’t until the PC version that we got to experience the game in its full glory.Of course, God of War’s story continues to be a banger. The world has changed a lot in the four years since the game was released, so I took different things away from this playthrough than it did the first time around. Kratos was not a great guy, and his move for Midgard was meant to put some distance between him and his past. His relationship with his wife and the birth of Atreus gave him a second chance at having a family. However, he’s obviously still dealing with feelings of inadequacy when the game begins.Throughout the game, the concept of what makes a good man and father is continually examined. Kratos tries to be a stern, cautious dad and doesn’t want to make the same mistakes his father and he made in the past. Unfortunately, this causes him to inadvertently withhold the love that Atreus needs in the wake of his mother’s death. Kratos distancing himself also makes Atreus think that he’s not strong enough to be his son.At the same time, Atreus is at the age where he’s figuring how who he is. The boy is torn between rebellion at what he feels are slights from Kratos and the need to convince his dad that he’s worthy of his love. I still love that we’re very much an audience to the story of Kratos and Atreus. Even when you’re doing side activities and exploring outside of the main story, the two converse with each other, telling stories and making observations.God of War also continues to have some of the best pacing I’ve ever seen in a game. It avoids the pitfall of many open-world games that make the main story seem urgent and then let you do whatever you want indefinitely. Instead, the game locks you in during certain parts, and you’re on a set path until that section has concluded.God of War has Metroidvania elements as well. As Kratos and Atreus gain new abilities and items, you’ll be able to revisit old areas in the open world sections and move past obstacles into new territory. Essentially, this means there are two paths of progression, the linear story, and the open-world areas.Midgard, which serves as the main open-world area, isn’t the most gigantic area in gaming history. Still, it’s packed with things to explore. After playing through some recent open-world titles, like Assassin’s Creed Valhalla and Cyberpunk 2077, I find I much prefer worlds that are dense with detail, even if they don’t necessarily feel gigantic.Fortunately, this is an excellent port. It played as smooth as butter for me at 4K and averaged higher than 60fps for almost my entire playthrough. There were a few times it dropped into the 50s, but the only way I noticed was the FPS counter.The only issue I found at all during my time with God of War on PC was with the implementation of DLSS. Turning it on caused framerates to climb into the 70s and 80s, but it had one nasty side effect. For some reason, it makes Kratos’ beard look kinda crappy. It’s not terrible, but it definitely loses fidelity when DLSS is turned on, and the lighting doesn’t interact with it properly. It might not seem like a big issue, but you see A LOT of close-ups of Kratos in cutscenes, and it can be a bit jarring. I didn’t install a God of War-specific driver, so it’s possible a fix for the issue might be coming soon.Aside from the above issue, it was smooth sailing. Shadow resolution and ambient occlusion are superior on PC, and the textures look amazing at 4K, even with DLSS turned on. Some players will find the lack of a FOV setting to be a negative, but I didn’t mind.God of War is obviously designed around using a controller, but keyboard and mouse aficionados will be happy to know that there is full rebind support and on-screen prompts change to reflect any new bindings. It’s great to see Sony is putting care into its ports, especially given the poor state we’ve seen some of them in the past.How impressive God of War is on PC really gives credit to Santa Monica Studio’s work on this game. It’s still a gorgeous journey through a unique take on Norse mythology, and a great way to play the game for the first time or revisit it before God of War Ragnarok releases. I’m as impressed with it now as I was the first time through it, and I look forward to seeing what’s in store for Kratos and Atreus in the sequel.10Jason Faulkner is Evolve Media's Senior SEO Editor.

Game Revolution,"

Jason Faulkner 
Almost every console has a defining game, one that comes to mind whenever you think about the platform. These are the Marios and Halos of the video game world, the exclusive games that sell systems. While no one could argue that the PlayStation 4 doesn’t have a sizable collection of quality exclusives, its library has been missing that magical title that makes gamers everywhere pause in reflection. A game that transcends all fan bases and attracts aficionados of any genre.Well, that game is finally here. God of War (2018) is an amalgam of the best of everything PS4 has to offer to this point. It perfects current-gen gameplay conventions and introduces it’s own twists that we’ll see replicated in games for years to come. God of War is the Breath of the Wild of the PS4, and it’s joined the handful or so of exclusive titles that alone are worth the price of the console.SIE Santa Monica has crafted an utterly amazing world in God of War. Part of this is because it’s rooted in Norse mythology and has a vast pool of legends to draw from. Sometime after God of War 3, Kratos pulled up his stakes and moved from Greece to Midgard. Instead of Zeus, Athena, and pals, Kratos now has to worry about the likes of Odin, Thor, and Baldur.However, instead of leaning entirely on the old tales, the writers have taken liberties with the legends here and there to weave the story of Kratos and his son Atreus into Norse mythology in a way that makes it feel as though they were always there. Additionally, SIE Santa Monica made this game with the idea in mind that those who have never played a God of War game can enjoy and understand it just as well as someone who has played all of them. It’s sort of a soft reboot (thus the God of War moniker instead of God of War 4) in that it doesn’t rely heavily on previous knowledge of the series, but longtime fans of the series will enjoy the references to previous events in Kratos’ life..The game begins with Kratos cremating the remains of his wife, Faye. Faye’s last wish was to have her ashes scattered from the highest mountain in all the realms. Sad, but a pretty simple objective, right? Unfortunately, Kratos may have run from Greece, but he can’t run from his godhood, and there are plenty of people in the Norse realms that aren’t particularly happy about a stray god traipsing about.At center stage in the game is Kratos’ relationship with his son. Kratos was a terrible father in Greece, and he didn’t do a much better job in Midgard. His relationship with Atreus is strained at best, and without Faye to stand as a medium between them they’re forced to directly interact with each other for an extended period for the first time.The two’s journey together is a struggle in multiple ways. Dealing with the loss of a wife and mother is hard enough on its own, but their histories make the going even tougher. Kratos, though older and wiser, still has a lot of difficulty with the concept of family. Not only did he kill his family due to Ares’ trickery, but his relationship with his own father and mother, Zeus and Callisto, was far from healthy. Because of Kratos standoffish demeanor, Atreus struggles to feel accepted by his father and doesn’t think he’ll ever be strong enough to make him proud.Watching the two grow throughout their journey is incredibly rewarding, and measures up with pairings such as Ellie and Joel or Lee and Clementine. The writing and acting bring out the bond between father and son and drive home the moments when it’s strengthened or strained. Atreus, while mature for his age, is still a young boy and watching Kratos teach him how to be a man, and how the world works is heartwrenching. Though you control Kratos, both he and Atreus are the main characters of the game, and part of what makes God of War so great is the fact that you’re made an audience to their struggles. Neither of them is an avatar for the player; this is their story and not a choose-your-own-adventure game.Just because you want Kratos or Atreus to do something doesn’t mean it’s going to happen. They do things according to their own personalities, regardless of how bad an idea it is. Some might be turned off by this “lack of player agency,” but I think that’s rubbish. After all the sandbox, open-world games that get released, I’m always thrilled to play a game with a strong lead role instead of some nameless protagonist making shallow, insignificant decisions.Instead, everything in God of War makes sense in the context of the world it takes place in. Almost nothing remains unexplained, down to fast travel and why the dwarven shopkeepers can be everywhere at once. Some games would suffer greatly by taking player choice out of the equation, but by closing the world to direct player influence, God of War is able to weave a fantastic plot and build an incredible world without having to worry about what’s going to happen if you randomly kill an NPC.Just because the plot of God of War is linear though, doesn’t mean there’s not exploration and open-world design. At key parts during the game, you’ll get the opportunity to break aware from the main quest for a while and explore Midgard and some of the other Norse realms.The great thing about the exploration in God of War is that you can participate in it as little or as much as you want. There are tens of hours of optional exploring and side questing you can do that will reward you with powerful armor and enhancements along with a ton of lore and backstory about the world you’re in. If you’re just interested in the story though, you can stay on the path and move on.An excellent design decision in God of War is that during many main plot points the game keeps you on task. If you need to hurry somewhere, the game locks you into that course of action so you won’t get distracted. This allows God of War to have the best of both worlds: an urgent and linear main quest and plenty of open-world exploration and side quests if you so choose.The pacing of how the world is revealed is excellent in God of War. At first, you don’t even have a compass. The game makes you figure out the basics without assistance and gradually introduces mechanics before doing so becomes cumbersome or irritating.Fast travel too, isn’t available from the start, and for most of the game, you can only fast travel to one centrally located area. As a result, you have to actually traverse the world on foot and by boat and take it all in instead of going to a menu and changing location every five minutes and waiting for a loading screen. Some players may find this irritating, but I really enjoyed how it set the pace for most of the game, and by the end, I felt like I had been on a real journey because of it.The pace of exploration is kept nicely as well. There are key events in the game that open up new areas to explore and new ways to get past certain obstacles. This means that you might complete exploring most of an area early in the game, but not have the means to open a door or create a path to the last part of that area until late in the game. This kind of keeps you filled with a sense of anticipation, wondering, “when will I get to see what’s behind that door?”Midgard is by far the largest area to explore, and where most of the game takes place, but you’ll gain access to five other realms as well. The Norse realms exist layered on top of one another, so each one is a different version of the other eight. This means that some are filled with cold winds while others are teaming with magma and spewing molten rock. All of these changes in scenery look amazing on the PS4, and with 4K and HDR this game goes a step beyond what even games like Horizon Zero Dawn showed us was possible on this platform.Beyond crisp resolution and stunning HDR colors though are the incredibly detailed textures. Your journey takes you through a lot of different environments, and the texture work in God of War really brings them to life. As I was playing through the main quest, I didn’t notice it so much, but as I was going back and completing the side quests and exploration I hadn’t finished yet, I took the time to really look at the scenery.Run-of-the-mill environmental aspects like dirt, water, and snow all look great, but it’s the buildings and statues that show how much love SIE Santa Monica put into this game. You’ll see temples with golden decor all about, all engraved with ridiculously intricate scrollwork and runes. The detail throughout the game is consistent and astounding, and even the most inconsequential areas seem to have had special care taken with them.Somehow the God of War displays all these visuals without any loading screens in-between areas. After the initial game load, you’ll never have a big black screen take you out of the action. Of course, this is mostly due to some clever programming tricks. Instead of a loading screen, you may have to paddle your boat through a narrow tunnel to the next area or wait for a piece of enchanted machinery to cycle.However, I’d much rather remain in control of a character, even if it means you’re just doing something mundane like riding an elevator. These disguised loading periods are also often punctuated by conversations between Kratos and Atreus about the state of the world or Kratos’ past. It gives a chance for some exposition during a time most games would just have a loading screen displayed, and keeps your head in the game instead of sighing and waiting for the next opportunity to play.There are plenty of undead (and living) foes that stand between Atreus and Kratos’ objective. The God of War games are known for their hack-and-slash gameplay, but this time around things are a bit more measured.Most of the control in the game is over Kratos, though you can also call on Atreus to assist you with his bow. Kratos’ starting weapon is the Leviathan Axe, which works a lot like Mjolnir. You can throw it and have it instantly fly back into Kratos’ hands. You’ll also have access to a retractable shield and, of course, Kratos’ fists.The combat in this game is similar to Horizon Zero Dawn, though it tends to play out fast and against more numerous and more powerful foes than that game. Enemies in God of War usually have two meters: health and stun. While the most straightforward way to kill an enemy is to drain their health to zero, you can also stun them with specific attacks. If you manage to fill the stun gauge enough to daze an enemy, Kratos can attack them for massive damage.The interplay between Kratos ax, fists, and shield, and Atreus’ bow makes for an impressive fighting system, one that when mastered will have you truly performing godlike acts of martial skill on-screen. Throwing your ax into a far-off Draugr for the kill, then stunning a nearby one and ripping it in half before calling back your ax to carve through a third enemy looks amazing and gives you a real feeling of power.As you continue through the game, both Kratos and Atreus gain new skills that add to the utility of their weapons. Kratos starts the game with some basic moves and the ability to throw his ax. However, by the time you reach the end, you’ll have acquired extra techniques that allow you to chain together devastating combos. If you put some time into learning the different combinations of attacks, you can eventually get to the point where most enemies can’t even touch you as you pull off infinite combos that kill just about anything that gets near.At the beginning of God of War, you’ll likely find one or two enemies difficult to take on, but there’s plenty of equipment to locate and craft that feeds into the games stat system. For the most part, an item’s power is dictated by its rarity, with Epic gear being the best.However, sometimes you’ll be better off wearing an upgraded piece of lower-tier gear than a fresh piece of Epic gear. There are also enchantments that bestow bonus effects when socketed into armor and weapons that give you beneficial effects like increased sprint speed or resistance to burn damage.Crafting new armor and enhancement items is a big part of why exploration and side quests in God of War are important. For going out of your way, you’ll often get access to a new item or crafting ingredients which will give you a mighty boost over what you’re currently wearing or let you upgrade your current equipment even further. Though like I said above, you can altogether skip out on all of this. The game rewards you with enough armor and enchantments as you play through that you can forgo the crafting system if you want.Unfortunately, God of War shares some of the issues that other third-person action games do. In fact, these problems are so widespread that I didn’t even end up counting them against this game in particular.During combat, it can be difficult to control the camera and keep a bead on the enemies you’re fighting. If you’re fighting a large number of foes or a particularly fast one, it’s not hard to lose track of them and take damage that you really shouldn’t have. There’s a lock-on function that helps this somewhat, but I found it a bit too sticky and using it was often more detrimental than helpful.God of War does have among the best controls I’ve seen in a third-person action game, though. Until humans can get a third arm grafted on to control the camera independently or someone comes up with a better controller idea than the standard configuration all three consoles use right now, then this is about as good as it’s going to get.The game has four difficulty settings, and I played on “Give Me a Balanced Experience” which corresponds to the Normal in most games. I found the combat challenging, but fair, and didn’t have an issue making it through most of the game without getting frustrated. I will say some side bosses are absolutely brutal and will try you even with a tricked out Kratos and Atreus.For those that want more of a challenge there’s also “Give Me a Challenge” (hard) and Give Me God of War (very hard), and for those who want a lighter experience, there’s “Give Me a Story (easy). For the first three difficulty modes you can change the difficulty at will, but for the hardest mode, you’re locked in for the duration. The difficulty setting seems to influence enemy AI, health and strength instead of limiting item usage or changing item placement, so it should only really affect how tough combat is.These aren’t the most robust difficulty options I’ve ever seen in a game, but they don’t have to be. Gamers who want a challenge have the opportunity to play through the game in that manner, and those who are in it for the story both should be satisfied with the options presented in God of War. If you want some extra difficulty, or you just don’t want a HUD, there’s an immersive mode available that lets you turn on and off parts of the HUD at will. In fact, it’s entirely possible to play through the whole game with a minimal or no interface.[springboard type=”video” id=”1735565″ player=”ga027″ width=”640″ height=”387″ ]I’ve never given a game a perfect score before, and I thought long and hard about whether or not God of War deserves it. No matter how much I enjoy a game, typically there are at least a few moments where I get frustrated or bored, but not with this one. It’s possibly the best example of what the PS4 has to offer, and I feel like it’s going to be one of those games that instantly comes to mind when they think of this console generation.The graphics, sound, combat, world, and plot all come together to make an exquisite package that is a prime example of why games are art and God of War is right up there with the best films and novels when it comes to storytelling. If you have a PlayStation 4, you should play God of War. If you don’t have one, you should consider getting one to play this game.PS4 digital review copy was provided by the publisher.

Destructoid,"darkI was highly skeptical of the soft God of War Norse reboot. I’m always willing to give something a shot, but taking the fast and frenetic combat of the original series and slowing it down to focus on a father and son relationship? It’s a bold and risky move.One that paid off in spades.God of War (PS4) Developer: SIE Santa Monica Studio Publisher: Sony Interactive Entertainment Released: April 20, 2018 MSRP: $59.99With its muted intro of…gathering wood, it’s immediately clear that God of War is moving in a new direction. The pacing, score, and the voicework are a hat tip at the level of effort that Santa Monica put into this labor of love, and can only be described as meticulous. Before you chop your first undead grunt in half, the table is set for a personal journey intertwined with an epic quest. Yes, you actually get both.I’ve jokingly referred to the project as “Dad of War” since it was revealed, but that light ribbing slowly became more of a term of endearment as I wrapped myself around the narrative. Kratos and his son Atreus have a tumultuous relationship at the start, and although you can guess where that setup is going, the way it gets there is organic. Having played every game in the series it’s a little tough for me to truly reconcile Kratos’ new turn from “murderous genocidal asshole” to “stern father,” but some of that history is addressed, and it’s strongly hinted that the rest will make its way into the fold eventually. I’m still wrestling with it.Atreus worms his way into combat and the game’s puzzles, mostly propelled by a square button prompt that initiates actions and commands him to fire arrows at enemies. I’ll be the first to admit that I was wary of the whole familial angle, but Atreus, at his worst at the absolute start of the tale, is merely a smartass. Very quickly he starts to come into his own in a way that doesn’t feel forced, and roughly five hours in he’s a badass in training that starts actively participating in combat with the player. Far too often works in any form of media can screw up the kid angle — but a kid that can summon spirit wolves, talk smack on Kratos, and choke out Norse zombies sure beats the hell out of most video game companions.What starts off as a semi-grounded affair (minus some quick bouts with the undead, a few trolls, and a God) soon gets otherworldly. If the narrative isn’t moving along there’s a subtle level of worldbuilding going on, frequently spouted in sections I call “story time,” when the player is rowing down a stream or walking toward a key destination. The heavy-hitting moments (including one “oh hell yea” scene) are few and far between which is a good thing, as the pacing is even-keeled. Without giving you any details, suffice to say this is not a self-contained story.Progression isn’t chapter-based as the discovery of new areas is seamlessly linked. For the critical path you’re moving from setpiece to setpiece, some of which are labyrinthine caves or quasi-large open zones, and then eventually you trigger a cutscene (which are nicely done with the in-game engine) or leap down from a ledge of no return. But after that individual bit is done, you’re free to come back and explore again, uncovering new secrets, sometimes with items you’ve picked up later in the story. There’s a legitimate endgame here after the credits roll, involving multiple optional areas, challenges, and bosses (the campaign took me roughly 20 hours to best, and I wrapped up every major quest minus a few collectibles in around 35).Shortly into the fray you’ll get a fast-travel item that works at specific doorways. It’s a great compromise because while there is some light bloat (the map constantly reminds you of missed riches and collectibles), it never reaches gargantuan radio tower levels. I’ll refrain from making direct comparisons, but with a bevy of shortcuts there’s a clear amount of From Software influence afoot.Okay but enough about how much God of War strays from the path of the original. Can you still rip apart wolf jaws and juggle fools with combos? Sure! At the start you’ll be kitted out with Kratos’ Leviathan Axe, which can be recalled after thrown and used in basic light/heavy attacks. Eventually you’ll unlock two magic slots, which are basically old combo abilities now tied to a cooldown — and you’ll earn new skills and light combos through experience points.Early on, the limited amount of moves at your disposal aren’t as flashy as you’d expect. Calling back your axe is very cool at first and even offers an additional layer of strategy (it’s incorporated into many puzzles), but it does get old. It would have been a lot more effective of a gimmick if you could recall it while running/jumping and so on to encourage more locomotion; as it stands you have to wait until a late upgrade to recall it quickly, and even then it’s in a limited fashion. In case you’re wondering QTEs are mostly out, with the exception of the occasional circle button mashing during key moments.Your bread and butter is using a heavy attack as a launcher then juggling with light blows, and peppering in arrows from Atreus. A quick tap for a smooth dodge and a double-tap for rolling is a nice touch, and my favorite aspect of combat is micro-managing Atreus while Kratos is animation locked. You can also manipulate your abilities in several cool ways, like linking them to a talisman that resets their cooldowns to create new builds. Despite these nuances, at first, I was worried. Initially, combat is clunkier than you’re used to in a refined God of War. That’s because the original trilogy contains some of the finest action mechanics of the past few decades, and it doesn’t mean that the new PS4 iteration is by any means sub-par.It’s a minor annoyance that you acclimate to after the first incredible boss fight, and more and more as you start to weave in Atreus and your god powers (Rage of the Gods is back), take in the scenery, acquire at least one new weapon, and deal with the runic and progression systems. Oh, God of War has more RPG elements now. Gear can be crafted or purchased after acquiring the appropriate materials, and it has a World of Warcraft rarity level of green, blue, purple, and gold.Kratos can level-up by equipping better gear, and has a full statline that can be min-maxed or evenly spread. It completely depends on what you want your playstyle to be and the kinds of gems you socket. Some of this begets grinding, especially later in the game as you’re scrounging for upgrades, but it’s by no means required to see the end of the tale. As always, swift dodging and a penchant for iFrame (invincibility) windows will get you past all of the game’s challenges.Don’t think that Santa Monica put all of their effort into dialogue and drama, as God of War maintains the same bonkers-level boss fights and setpieces, all of which are presented in the stunning in-game engine that features a hell of a draw distance. Environmental destruction helps give fights scale, and the new engine is constantly trying to push the envelope. I was hanging on by a thread in what feels like nearly every battle, which speaks to the balance team’s talent on a technical level too.A bit of housekeeping, as I know there’s a lot of purists out there: the medium difficulty setting feels pretty on-point, and there’s a hard and very hard setting to mess around with from the start. You can also swap to easy, medium, or hard whenever you want (very hard is a take-it-or-leave-it kind of thing that locks you from changing it).God of War is a different game for a new era of the medium. While I’m a sucker for more frantic arcadey action there are plenty of studios left carrying on that legacy. Unless something catastrophic happens to Sony Santa Monica, there’s more story to tell, and I hope the exact same team is able to tell it.[This review is based on a retail version of the game provided by the publisher.]Essential10s aren't perfect, since nothing is, but they come as close as you could get in a given genre. The new leader to beat in its sector, we're talking pure ecstasy.
