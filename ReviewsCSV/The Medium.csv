Eurogamer,"A game of two halves.Death is everywhere here. You can feel it. You can smell it. I know that makes no sense - how can you tell that from a video game? - and yet you know that's what it smells like, a muddy, earthy, cloying scent that sticks in your throat as you tiptoe across the razor-thin edge between Here and There. Light and shadow. Life and death. Fungus blooms everywhere and doorways quiver, blanketed with a thick, terrible, alien skin. Later, arms will hang down from the ceilings and shattered bones will jut out of the ground. Later still, the entire world will be soaked in a blood-red filter as you scramble up mountains of paperwork and giant, haphazard filing cabinets. Even the 'real' world is scattered with reminders of what used to be. A hotel is frozen in time, the scattered belongings of its guests - suitcases and odd shoes and forgotten toys - sprinkled throughout the ruins. It's the kind of place that someone coined the word ""hubbub"" for, a room that's supposed to ripple with laughter and footsteps and the endless ting of the bell on reception. For you, though, it's empty. Cold. Dead. Death is all Marianne has ever known. It begins with The Medium's opening line - ""It all starts with a dead girl"" - and doesn't waver right up until the credits roll. Even in this reality - her safe place, supposedly - she's an undertaker, and that's where we find her as her story begins, preparing to bury the only man that ever showed her any kindness.  The duality of The Medium isn't subtle. It draws heavily on the ying-yang of contrast - good and bad; up and down; happiness and sadness - and recycles it endlessly, thematically and literally. There's no attempt to conceal Bloober's unabashed affection of old school horror, either. There have been flickers of it throughout the studio's horror-heavy back catalogue, but no game has come quite as close to The Medium in terms of unadulterated adoration. That said, there's a reason why some of those old horror tropes have been left in the past. The fixed camera angles undoubtedly enable the developer to spin a more sophisticated visual narrative, as well as heighten tension and uneasiness, but I am forever impaling Marianne on environmental hazards I simply can't see. The tank controls, too, are better in theory than practice. You no doubt already know that Troy Baker lends his talents to terrifying antagonist The Maw, and yes, he's predictably wonderful as it - the creature's guttural mutterings and furtive soliloquies hint at something vaguely human, or at least attempting to appear so - but otherwise, the voice performances are a little uneven. I can't say I particularly warmed to Marianne, either; though fearless, her character was a tad too one-note for me. It was the story that kept me gripped, and while that too perhaps lacked the depth I'd been hoping for, it's nonetheless an intriguing yarn that - like its title - was neither too long nor too short, but... well, medium length, at around eight-ish hours.But oh my lord, is it beautiful here. I know it's weird to say that - this netherworld is a burnt, broken place; it's not somewhere you'd choose to holiday - but there's an undeniable beauty here, too, secreted between the alien flora, fungi and fear. Juxtaposed just-so between the piles of skulls and frozen death masks, Bloober's canny use of fixed vignettes means every shot is perfectly dreadful and dreadfully perfect, and only further enhanced by the soundscapes sculpted by composer Arkadiusz Reikowski and Silent Hill sound director and producer, Akira Yamaoka. The inspiration drawn from celebrated Polish artist Zdzisław Beksiński (whose work I've now fallen wholly and inextricably in love with) is all over it, yes, but to Bloober's credit, the world it's painted is so much more than mere homage. As I progressed through Marianne's story, the set-pieces reminded me of several games that have come before it - Alice: Madness Returns, Control, Silent Hill, and even Portal 2, to name but a few - and given every single one of them is celebrated for its striking visual vocabulary, that can't be a bad thing. And if there was a photo mode I'd have endlessly abused it. I suspect that's weird to say, too, but it's true. While it starts out muted - at first, Marianne's alternate reality is painted with mud and rust - the further you progress, the more vibrant it'll become, as though each time she returns to the real world, she leaves a fragment of herself behind to soften its palette and fill it with pale blues, mossy greens, and ruby reds. The Medium isn't quite as scary as prior Bloober offerings, though. Beyond one early, unexpected surprise (I still have bruised knees from where my legs collided with the underside of my desk), it's a sedate affair, choosing to let its environments unsettle you rather than jumpscares. While I admit I missed some of Layer of Fears' creative shocks, I can't say this is to the game's detriment, and may even win over new horror fans who crave atmosphere over scripted scares.Moving through two realities simultaneously is every bit as disorientating as it sounds initially, but Bloober overcomes this with clever engineering that goes beyond merely projecting two versions of the same scene. More often than not, splitscreen cut-scenes portray slightly different perspectives, and what you'll see in one isn't always apparent in the other. This means you'll find your gaze flicking from one side of the screen to the other - some splits are horizontal; others are vertical - in search of the irregularities, like a macabre spot-the-difference puzzle.Talking of puzzles; cerebral they are not. I've been stuck on Bloober puzzles for hours in the past - Blair Witch stumped me good and proper several times - but The Medium's offerings are less opaque, and only a couple outstay their welcome. Marianne has just three tricks up her psychic sleeve; Insight - the power to see beyond the veil and spy secrets an ordinary gaze will miss; Spirit Blast, which enables her to shoot out a powerful shock of energy to overload electrics or shake off enemies; and the ability to have an Out of Body Experience.Yeah. I know. It sounds strange, and it is a bit. The former's pretty cool, enabling her to get auditory visions of the past from everyday items, as well as construct Echoes, ghostly memories of the past that help Marianne piece together what once happened here. Spirit Blast, while ostentatious, is underutilised. Out of Body Experience, on the other hand, enables her to divorce her spirit from her physical form to access something - usually a lock - in the spirit realm. She can also absorb and channel psychic energy by locating Spirit Wells - a font of psychic power, I guess you'd call it - that can also be used to ward off denizens as well as open doors. Your Out of Body Experience is always time-limited, though, as her spiritual side will slowly dissipate until you return her to her physical body. Dawdle too long, and she'll die. It's perhaps no surprise, then, that given its so heavily constrained by the careful camera angles and tourniquet-tight storytelling, the gameplay is so rigid it might as well be on rails. Sadly, this results in an astonishing lack of organic exploration. Maybe it's greedy to want more, but I do wish I could've spent more time scurrying around that topsy-turvy place, peeking into every creepy cranny and unmasking every secret. Beyond this sedate puzzling, Marianne will find herself either skulking about or fleeing for her life. Again, the team has seemingly learned from mistakes such as Layer of Fear 2's tedious scripted death sequences, and while there's no doubt that making her run full-pelt towards the camera is both terrifying and a nod to horror games of yore, it gets old quickly. One breathlessly brilliant exception, however, sends you continuously catapulting between worlds as you run for your life, trying to avoid the hazards as you go. Yes, Marianne's world is one of duality - good and evil; heaven and hell; life and death - there is little negative to weigh down Bloober Team's lofty ambition. Even though it substitutes scripted scares for an unsettling atmosphere instead - something I fear not all fans will be happy with - The Medium is the studio's most successful, accessible offering yet, and a sign that Bloober continues to improve, mature, and innovate. I cannot wait for its next terrifying adventure.

Link: Official siteWe're all going to die some day, so I won't waste your time: The Medium is one of the best third-person horror games I've ever played. Bloober Team, the studio behind Blair Witch and the Layers of Fear series, has completely outdone those less ambitious games with the fantastically written, emotionally grounded story of Marianne, a young woman who can see and communicate with spirits. What it lacks in technical polish it makes up for with chilling set pieces and thoughtful plot developments.

The Medium plays like an old school Resident Evil game, minus the guns. You navigate Marianne around crumbling, abandoned hotels and claustrophobic Cold War bunkers from fixed camera angles, which can be cumbersome, but it's an effective design choice. Like the games that inspired it, The Medium is excellent at making you feel like you're always being watched, and that danger could be lurking just out of view at any time.What you do is fairly simple: Most sections involve finding hidden objects, solving puzzles, or sneaking past ghastly enemies against whom you are mostly powerless. The added gimmick is that Marianne can sometimes see into the spirit world, which is handled by splitting your screen in half. All inputs affect the real and spirit world versions of Marianne identically, but things are complicated by small differences in the terrain or enemies that only exist in one world. Bloober definitely didn't push this idea to its limits. Most of the puzzles are fairly simple, and there were only a couple of those Portal-like ""A-ha!"" moments that made me feel like I'd done something really clever. But the lack of roadblocks keeps the pacing fairly brisk, which works well with the kind of story that's being told.That story is undoubtedly the star. The Medium is exquisitely paced and plotted, with multidimensional characters and a complex, but not convoluted, supernatural mystery to uncover. I had several running theories about what was going on at the haunted Niwa Resort that all made sense, but the true answer ended up being even more elegant and poignant than I guessed—and yet the solution didn't come out of left field, M. Night Shyamalan style. Over its course, The Medium asks what makes a person evil, and what the difference is between the innately sadistic and those who are turned into monsters by cycles of violence—though it doesn't apologize for anyone. In untangling these themes it explores domestic abuse and even genocide, but these concepts aren't displayed gratuitously for mere shock value. It's some of the sharpest writing I've seen in a videogame in quite a long time.This is all supported by a spectacular voice cast. From the intrepid but troubled Marianne to the enigmatic avenger Thomas to a deeply unnerving archvillain brought to life by Troy Baker, every character is realized with exceptional emotional depth and authenticity. The central struggle Thomas faces, in particular, is a heartbreaking story of a man in an impossible situation, and all of its highs and lows hit me right in the heart. It's easy to find common ground with characters who are trying to do the right thing in a world with no right answers.Composers Arkadiusz Reikowski and Akira Yamaoka (Silent Hill franchise) back the exploration with a haunting, melancholy score, and then bring intense, disturbing tracks when we're fleeing for our life—it's music you'll notice and appreciate. And every rundown hallway and spooky Polish forest feels alive thanks to some of the best positional audio and layered ambience I've heard in a game: Lifelike echoes bounce off of a concrete tunnel, and the ramblings of a creature hunting you pace back and forth between the left and right audio channels.It looks pretty stunning, too, with overgrown, post-Soviet ruins in the real world and a macabre, yellow-tinged spirit world as its surreal mirror. The textures, color balance, and lighting evoke a range of moods: intrigue, unease, and unadulterated horror.Niwa Resort is layered with small details from roof to paving stones, including crinkled old Polish magazines accurate to the 1990s era. When Marianne is split between worlds, walls of human flesh and spectral moths are juxtaposed with the mundanity of an abandoned classroom on the other side of the screen. It gives the sense that you're never really safe—when the split screen effect goes away and you're just looking at the classroom, how do you know what's going on over on the other side? The character models are the one area where detail is lacking, especially in contrast to how fantastic everything else looks. They stand out with a somewhat doll-like appearance, and stiff animations. They won't always connect with the objects they're interacting with.There are performance issues, too. While I was generally able to maintain a good 45-60 fps on my RTX 2060 Super, there is a significant amount of hitching when you first enter the spirit world or transition between gameplay and a cutscene. This took the bite out of some key moments, like a monster jumping out at you for the first time. The RTX effects can look stunning, but they dropped me down closer to a 30-35 fps baseline with some dips into the mid-20s. The ""RTX On"" setting disables certain effects dynamically when performance dips too low, which is kind of nice, but can lead to weirdness like water flickering between RTX and non-RTX shading in a jarring way. The ""Force On"" option will prevent this, but it made certain areas with complex point lighting, particularly in the spirit world, an unplayable slideshow. So neither setting is completely ideal.On another PC with an RTX 2070 Super, we managed framerates in the 40s to 60s at 1440p with RTX On and DLSS set to high quality, but also ran into occasional slideshows if RTX was bumped up to the highest setting.Despite some technical foibles and the simple, unchallenging stealth and puzzle solving, I fell completely in love with The Medium. The writing stacks up to the very best in the genre with its well-crafted mystery that explores difficult, often heartbreakingly relatable themes on its way to a satisfying, though not uplifting conclusion. Top-notch actors realize complex and memorable heroes and monsters along the way, and the score, sound design, and art are gorgeous, pulling together an unforgettable, cohesive whole.

Metro GameCentral,"The first major Xbox Series X exclusive is finally out, featuring a special split-screen display that’s only possible on next gen.As much as Microsoft’s plan for the Xbox Series X/S seems to go against all previously accepted norms it does seem to be working. The new consoles enjoyed the best launch ever for Xbox hardware and attracted 18 million Game Pass subscribers. They not only did that with no exclusives but no games of any kind that run only on Xbox Series X/S and not also Xbox One. But with the release of The Medium that is no longer the case.Although you’d imagine that distinction would be a welcome coup for publisher and developer Bloober Team, being the first major exclusive for the Xbox Series X/S immediately puts more pressure on the game than it can take. So while there are some technical tricks that would be impossible without an SSD we’d immediately forget any thoughts of this being a graphical powerhouse that will show off the full power of the new consoles.We’d also abandon any notions that this is a spiritual successor to Silent Hill and other classic survival horrors, as you’d have to be of a very nervous disposition (or have an unnatural aversion to moths) to find anything in the game frightening, bar a couple of jump scares. The game does have other qualities, and an impressively ambitious approach to narrative, but they struggle to make up for the other failings.The comparisons with Silent Hill come from the idea that that The Medium is a more psychological style of horror game (and that Akira Yamaoka worked on the soundtrack) and certainly it is very far away from shlock like Resident Evil. You play as Marianne, a former orphan who can see the spirit world and its denizens, and who becomes embroiled in the mystery surrounding a post-war holiday camp out in the rural backwaters.The entire game is set in Poland, with the script relying heavily on the country’s history for some plot points, but weirdly no-one has a Polish accent and at first we thought Marianne meant she’d been adopted from America. That’s not the case though, it’s just that the English language voiceovers completely ignore the Polish setting, which immediately spoils the atmosphere – especially as there’s no way to listen to the Polish voice track with English subtitles.As it is, the game opens with Marianne returning to her family home after the death of her foster father. It becomes evident that his spirit hasn’t moved on and so you’re introduced to her key ability to see and interact with the spirit world. This involves the screen splitting in two, sometimes vertically and sometimes horizontally, so that you can see both worlds at once.The real and spirit worlds have layouts that are similar but different, with a desk in one being an altar like object in the other, or a door being open in one world but locked in another. Any veteran gamer will immediately recognise this as the light/dark world mechanic from Zelda: A Link To The Past, except in The Medium you have to navigate both worlds at once – with both versions of Marianne moving in tandem but stopping as soon as one of them is blocked.As rich with potential as the concept may seem The Medium seems to instinctively opt for the least interesting and most obvious puzzles at any given time, as you flit between focusing on one world over the other to get through maze-like building layouts or do things like manipulate a clock face to change the appearance of the spirit world.We’ve no idea how the logic on that is supposed to work, and we’re not sure the game does either, but it carries on throwing cliché after cliché at the gameplay, including a form of detective vision that highlights interactive objects, a spirit shield that is mostly used to survive swarms of demonic moths, and a psychic fireball that you have to charge up from certain locations in the spirit world.There’s little real combat in the game and instead those fireballs are more frequently used to charge up the spirit world equivalent of a junction box or other electrical device, which seems just as silly in context as it sounds on paper. Sometimes though, objects can only be reached by fully entering the spirit world, causing the other screen to almost disappear and allowing you to move around freely for a few seconds without worrying about mirroring your movements in the real world.The look of the afterlife is apparently modelled on the work of Zdzisław Beksiński, but the brown, dusty locations are more immediately reminiscent of cheap horror movies and Keanu Reeves’ otherwise unmemorable Constantine film and game tie-in. On a technical level the backdrops are often impressive, despite the fixed Resident Evil style camera angles, but the character models are usually much less so, with some very simplistic animation; there’s also a lot of texture pop-in when zooming in on objects.At heart it’s just a fundamentally uninteresting vision of the netherworld, with most of the characters you meet not being fully aware of where they are and so usually only offering frustrating, circular conversations. Further into the game you take control of a second character as you explore the histories of various troubled spirits but the plot’s frequent change of focus comes across as more confusing than intriguing.Alan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNew Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart bundle is £50 off reveals leakXbox will be less hands-off with Bethesda amid major reorganisationThe Medium does attempt to tackle some serious subjects, including child abuse and PTSD, but never in any satisfying depth, such that the mundanity of the gameplay and the leaden pacing makes what is a barely 12-hour experience seem considerably longer. As a survival horror it’s never really scary and its attempts at psychological inquiry are stymied by a bland script and equally uninteresting puzzles.Despite its next gen credentials, The Medium feels disappointingly old-fashioned and unexciting. Everything works as its intended – this isn’t a broken game, it’s just not a very interesting one. The storytelling ambitions are commendable but the execution is poor, with the story frequently feeling aimless and unengaging. In the end ‘medium’ seems a fairly generous description of the game’s qualities, in what is one of the more forgettable horror games of recent years.In Short: Instead of high-tech thrills and survival horror chills, this disappointingly mundane thriller struggles to impress with a muddled narrative and unengaging gameplay.Pros: The light/dark world concept is always fun and the game’s plot does attempt to tackle some weighty issues. Impressive background graphics and split screen effect.Cons: The plot is unfocused, poorly paced, and needlessly confusing. Very few survival horror scares and the puzzles are mostly simplistic and uninteresting.

It's a busy mix of mechanics and story threads that jostle to fit in, never settling, and rarely trusting the player to enjoy themselves without a watchful hand to guide them. I spent a lot of time tapping the run button for example, because I wanted to move faster, but you can only run when allowed. And if The Medium decides you're in an atmospheric moment you'd better damn well walk and soak it in. It feels like a story that someone spent so long thinking about, planning, and clearly loving, that they forgot about the bit where another person has to play it and panicked at the last minute that people might play it wrong. Release date: January 28, 2021
Platform(s): PC and Xbox Series X
Developer: Bloober Team
Publisher: Bloober TeamIt's part a love letter to the old days of fixed camera horror games (with Silent Hill's composer Akira Yamaoka providing some great sparsely atmospheric music in places), and part an attempt to reimagine the idea by showing a split reality on-screen where the real and spirit realm overlap. The idea is that, as a medium called Marianne, you're able to exist in both planes and manipulate things across them as you try to solve the murder of a little girl. One of the main mechanics, for example, is the idea of drawing power from a Spirit Well, a sort of ghostly energy source in the spectral world, to power a fuse box in the real world and open a door. The idea of being able to use separate but coexisting worlds to progress is interesting, but it's never really expressed in a way that feels innovative. Often the overall gist is still the usual locked door/find key idea -  there are doors in one world, a key in the other and that's about it. I waited for a 'oh that's good' moment when the split camera sections did something clever, but it never came. It's a very controlling experience too. While there are some good puzzles, there's often a sparsity of things to interact with, making progress a simple job of matching up what little you're given, in the order you're meant to. There's a big lack of freedom to what you're actually able to do. At one point I entered and explored a room, wandering between a series of clearly important areas - tables covered with items and so on - that were inert, and apparently contained nothing of use. A few minutes later I found some arbitrary object that then created a breadcrumb trail to all the areas I'd previously discovered with the objects I couldn't touch before, now able to trigger sequential pieces of a story reward. This odd structure of objects only becoming relevant when you find them in the right order is a constant theme: gameplay and puzzles acting to fence you into a path so you can receive a tour in the way the guide intended. There's rarely much agency as a player - the gameplay doesn't serve the story, but rather controls it, using object picking puzzles and treasure hunts to meter it out. It strips the fun out of exploring when you realize finding something boils down to when you're meant to, not when you actually do.The gameplay rarely acknowledges the tension or momentum of what's going on either. There's a particularly long puzzle towards the end that's perfectly fine and nicely designed but just drops like a sedentary weight on the ""holy shit what's happening?"" build-up of the story. Sections often exist in suspended moments of their own that pay little attention to ongoing events. The stealth sections are extremely guilty of this. There's a creature called The Maw pursuing you, voiced by the usually excellent Troy Baker. Here, however, he's apparently channeling 'The Muppets do Satan', ricocheting wildly between Gollum, Jermaine Clement, Tim Curry in Rocky Horror, and at least three of the Skeksis from The Dark Crystal. These Maw sections are often big non sequitur moments. Either because he rocks up for no clear reason, or because you have to solve some arbitrary puzzle to progress. (At one point I had to electrocute him to get past which I don't really think is how ghosts work.) These moments also lack as much threat as they do narrative purpose. He's basically invisible most of the time and there's no clear indication of when he can see you or when you're in danger. 'Press the right stick to hold your breath' the game explains at one point without ever clarifying when and how this might help. Death or escape are the only resolutions and you don't know which one is coming until it happens. Sometimes it feels like some things have been added to fix some of these issues. Spectral butterflies appear to lead you around. In one single section, an arrow appears over your head to tell you where to look. One stealth section let me die repeatedly until a prompt finally appeared to tell me I should use a mechanic that had never been a part of stealth before. It's a game that isn't prepared to be played any way other than intended and sometimes has to point really hard at what that intent is. I solved what I thought was a good puzzle but wasn't able to complete it until the game walked me, step by step, through dialogue for each part of the puzzle in turn. Another time I died at the end of a level and, knowing what to do, went straight to the stuff I needed... Except I couldn't pick anything up until I went back to the start, triggered the initial step and then went back to the thing I was just at. The checkpointing and saving is also pretty bad. You can't save manually and so just have to hope the background auto-saving will be close behind you. It isn't easy to die but if you do you'll have to retread entire chunks. Like the mechanics there's a scattershot 'didn't know where to stop' feel to the plotting. There is a good story here, but again: just too much. There are at least three substantial threads that feel like they could have held their own, but coiled together they heave and strain against each other until the very end explains what's really going on. At that point it becomes very clear which parts mattered, and which bits could have been a line but ended up a chapter. Things like an entire, almost DLC-like gameplay coda in the middle is interesting, but an unnecessary chunk of game that adds nothing beyond telling you a specific background event happened. The sad thing is, I did like the core of the story. There's a good pay off in the end once you filter out the extra stuff, and there are some nice gameplay moments and ideas that could have done more given space to develop. There's a phrase, 'kill your darlings' that's meant as creative advice. It means you sometimes have to completely get rid of ideas and things you've worked really hard on for the good of the overall story; things you might love and adore, and that aren't necessarily bad, but really need to go in order to make the complete experience better. The Medium feels like that never happened. Gameplay and narrative are  desperate for a streamlining edit that never came. There are flashes where you can see what this could have been: atmospheric moments of exploration, a couple of lovely detective-style puzzles, some really interesting insights into the traumatic post-communist 90s Poland setting. But it tries to do too much and what nice beats there are feel like luck struck through quantity rather than quality intent. Perhaps the most disappointing thing here for me is that I've been a Bloober Team fan since the incredible Layers of Fear (still one of the best horror games of all time). It's a studio that's always had interesting ideas, stories, and mechanics, but none of that shows here. The Medium isn't even really a horror game, despite the setting and themes, and lacks any scares bar an early cheap jump. For a studio so focused on creating psychological horror it's hard to see this mildly spooky action-adventure as anything other than a misstep. Reviewed on PC.

Game Informer,"With our five senses, we perceive a great deal of the world around us. But what if another world exists behind the one we see? What if a second reality sits just behind the façade of our experiences? And, what if this reality is full of spirits we cannot see and cannot touch, who brush past us on a daily basis? Bloober Team attempts to explore this mysterious spirit realm with its puzzle-filled horror adventure, The Medium. Sadly, Bloober Team’s vision for an unseen reality isn’t that exciting to look at.Marianne is a supernatural medium who can talk to the dead, but when she receives a mysterious phone call summoning her to a derelict hotel on the outskirts of Kraków, Poland, her talents are truly tested. When Marianne arrives at the resort, the only inhabitants she encounters are tormented lost souls and an invisible monster who forces Marianne to wrestle with her past. The Medium’s narrative starts with a lot of promise, but quickly loses steam. Marianne doesn’t have much of a personality, and is little more than a cipher to move the plot along. Moreover, certain details are hard to follow, and The Medium's few interesting twists (near the end of the game) feel unearned.It’s unfortunate that The Medium’s narrative doesn’t shine, because a solid story may have pulled me through its uninspired gameplay. As Marianne communes with the dead, she is occasionally tasked with solving simple puzzles, such as rerouting the power to a car lift or finding the missing pieces to a broken mirror. Sadly, only a small handful of these puzzles ask the player to look for clever solutions. For example, I enjoyed paying attention to clues in my environment to decipher the passcode for a locked door, but most of the time I felt like I was completing grunt work, hauling random items from one end of the environment to the other so I could place them back where they obviously belong.The Medium’s one unique element comes from how it handles the spirit realm. At designated points in the story, Marianne inhabits both the real world and the spirit world at the same time. During these sequences, the screen splits in half to show Marianne’s location in each realm. A room that is blocked off in the real world might be open in the spirit realm, which encourages you to carefully explore both realities and find a way forward. This is a neat idea, and I enjoyed manipulating objects in one realm to affect the other. But even in the spirit realm, most puzzles boil down to returning objects to their proper place. The spirit realm is also incredibly drab, and its overtly grotesque design diminished my enthusiasm for crossing realities. I love good, creepy atmosphere, but The Medium’s environments are simply grotesque environments formed of human-like skin, not terror-inducing locales.Like a lot of modern horror games, The Medium forgoes traditional combat mechanics in an effort to amplify the scares – but this doesn't do enough to turn up the tension. The Medium sets the stage for several chilling moments, but often fails to deliver. For example, Marianne occasionally encounters a powerful beast that forces her to either run or hide. These moments seem thrilling at first, but the monster is so easy to evade that it quickly stops feeling like a threat. The stealth sequences are particularly disappointing because they are so linear that there is never any question on where you need to hide; these moments are more like trials in patience as you wait for the monster to move on so you can creep forward to the next hidey-hole. Some of the best horror games of the last decade have offered combat-free frights. After all, abandoned buildings are scarier when you can’t push back against the shadows. However, The Medium’s lack of combat highlights the challenge of letting atmosphere and puzzles carry a horror experience. The idea of exploring split realities is neat, but Bloober Team needed another gameplay hook to hang its hat on, because this horror show is a bit shallow.

Polygon,"Filed under:Bloober Team’s horror game gets bogged down by tired tropesThe first spirit you see in The Medium is someone you know. It’s your foster father Jack, a man with a warm smile and a beleaguered cadence to his voice. As Marianne, a funeral home worker with the ability to enter the spirit world and communicate with the dead, you knew this moment was coming. That doesn’t make it any easier.After Jack’s spirit manifests in the funeral home and breaks a vase, Marianne finds and deals with him the way she’s done with so many other spirits before him. Jack isn’t malevolent or somehow twisted into a monster by his vices and regrets; he’s confused and tired, not entirely sure of what’s going on. After one final conversation with her loved one — something Marianne admits few others get to have — she sees him off to face the next life in peace.It’s a touching opening, and a hint at the kinds of ghost stories The Medium seems poised to tell: ones in which the dead must confront personal issues instead of curses or demons. And for a while, the game sticks to that tone, grounding Marianne’s eventual journey into the spirit world in a thick history, one filled with haunted people and places. But as its dual-world concept comes into focus and its ghost stories wade into muddier waters, The Medium doesn’t build on these intriguing threads, and instead begins to follow a more rote horror framework.After Marianne sees her foster father off, she gets a call from a stranger named Thomas, urging her to come to the Niwa Worker’s Resort just outside Krakow, Poland, and dangling answers about a recurring dream Marianne has been trying to decipher for most of her life. When she arrives, the resort is abandoned and padlocked. Marianne has to find her way inside.The Medium is a fairly straightforward adventure game; you explore environments as Marianne from set camera angles, and have to move objects to climb walls, use keys to open doors, and examine items to glean a little history from them using your medium powers. Throughout, The Medium makes sure you can’t forget the weight that history can have on a place. Before you ride into the resort, a TV-style opening credits sequence bombards you with dozens of black-and-white stock footage shots, setting the mood for when you find all the cheerful townsfolk suddenly gone. As you explore the resort, you see chalk drawings in the parking lot, then notes written in the lobby by the resort’s inhabitants and signage created by its owners on the walls.It’s here that The Medium begins to flex its central hook: Marianne can manifest herself in both the physical and spiritual worlds, which are largely the same, but in key ways are asymmetrical. She can split herself up and examine specters of people’s pasts by channeling objects, too, which opens up the first few areas of the resort to some mildly interesting puzzles in which you need to move the spirit-world Marianne through an area impassable to her in the physical world, then flip a switch or use her spirit-world energy to turn on a fuse box to power an elevator. The puzzles make some interesting use of both worlds, but none of them stand out as particularly clever, making the whole concept feel underutilized.Several cutscenes also play out in both worlds at once, a neat idea that also doesn’t end up being crucial. While I regularly saw Marianne talking with an otherworldly presence in the spirit world but acting by herself in the physical world on the same screen, I never caught a character speaking in one world and another character’s reaction to what they’re saying in the other, or anything else that rewarded me for darting my eyes between the two halves of the screen.The two-world conceit instead works best as a way to take in the stories of the ghosts you encounter. You soon meet up with Sadness, the spirit of a young girl with a missing arm who helps you put together a few details about why Thomas brought you to the resort, and assists you with a few puzzles along the way. The rapport between Marianne and Sadness is, again, touching, a source of light and company in an otherwise dark and lonely silence.The spirit world is a realm of metaphors, and The Medium doesn’t let you forget it. When Marianne finds a razor blade in the spirit world that she can use to cut through what appear to be walls of flesh, she immediately remarks, “This thing isn’t a razor. It’s ... guilt. Shame. Regret.” That line is a particularly egregious example of the story interpreting itself for you, but it’s indicative of the game’s overall tone. The metaphors you encounter — abusers represented as literal monsters, or traumatic events made manifest in historical artifacts — lack the kind of ambiguity or occasional conflicting meanings that can make horror and mysticism so enticing. Instead, the meanings have been laid out for you, leaving you with few opportunities to interpret or dig deeper.Over time, The Medium becomes far more concerned with the secrets behind Thomas’ call, but this plot line, for all its twists, is much less interesting than the early, more empathetic tales of the dearly departed. Rather than focusing on stories that capture the feeling of loss of both individual people and their communities, The Medium pivots to a story about personal trauma as a catalyst for cycles of violence, as one person’s traumatic childhood causes them to inflict that same pain on someone else. Here, again, The Medium is not subtle; it uses extreme backstories like child abuse as shortcuts to establish characters as victims or villains, making a strong connection between “terrible thing happens to person” and “person is overcome by terrible thing.” The trauma we face inarguably affects and changes us as people, but The Medium doesn’t deliver that message in a compelling way. Instead, it paints with too broad a brush, smothering strokes of black and white in a way that leaves little room for interpretation or nuance. Interacting with both the physical and spiritual worlds also quickly loses its charm. Marianne eventually becomes the target of The Maw, a monster from the spirit world that can’t be killed, and which you must hide from in a few stealth sections in both worlds. I thankfully never had to fight the thing, but every time I’d have to hide or run from The Maw, it felt like something I’d already done or encountered somewhere else. These sequences feel out of place in a game that otherwise seems fairly comfortable moving outside the bounds of traditional horror games.Eventually, The Medium abandons its surprisingly empathetic take on the afterlife altogether to become a thriller, which, while honing in on a single thread, ends up being shallow and disappointing. The twists aren’t predictable but aren’t shocking, either, and while the latter half of the game sets itself up as an intricate web of interconnected relationships and secrets, it teases out hidden identities and other twists for way longer than it took for me to figure them out, leaving me waiting for the story to catch up. By the time I’d rolled credits and began processing what had just happened, I realized I didn’t have many plot points or striking moments to chew on.It’s in these shifts from the quiet history of its locales and characters to an uninteresting suspense story that The Medium turns from a game ready to tackle the heartbreak of losing a loved one — or how that loss can reverberate through others over time — to yet another familiar story about violence. It can’t help but turn the traumatic experiences it wrestles with into trivial plot points to move its story along. As much as its latter half is concerned with doling out big revelations, none of them will stick with me as much as being able to talk to Jack one last time. The Medium will be released Jan. 28 on Windows PC and Xbox Series X. The game was reviewed on PC using a pre-release download code provided by Bloober Team. Vox Media has affiliate partnerships.

GameSpot,"The Medium is a terrifying but compelling exploration of duality that uses the horror of personal trauma to craft a memorable tale.By 
    Jordan Ramée
   on January 27, 2021 at 2:31PM PSTThe world of The Medium begs to be closely examined, to be parsed for small details that begin to paint monsters as something not too dissimilar to humans. Recognizing these similarities, at times, can be even more terrifying than facing an actual grotesque creature. There's something disturbing about being forced to confront the evils that humans can inflict on one another, and recognize how horrific acts of sexual abuse, ethnoreligious discrimination, and physical violence rarely, if ever, result in a singular trauma. The aftereffects of such actions can fester in the heart and mind of victims for years, an unsettling truth that is often glossed over. It's here that The Medium finds the basis for its story, one that leaves a lasting impressionIn The Medium, you play as Marianne (voiced by Kelly Burke, who does a fabulous job), a powerful clairvoyant who travels to the Niwa Resort. She goes there in search of Thomas, a man who leaves her a strange message telling her to find and help him, promising that he'll give her the answers she seeks about her past in return. As a medium, Marianne is able to commune with spirits and help them pass on to the afterlife, a skill she's developed working in her foster father's funeral home. To that end, The Medium plays out on two planes of existence: the normal world and the spirit world, the latter of which acts as a twisted reflection of the former.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: The Medium ReviewThe spirit world--inspired by the surreal dystopia portrayed in the paintings of Zdzisław Beksiński--is a nightmarish hellscape, one where the doors are made of human skin that you have to slowly carve open with a rusty knife, and the inhabitants are either monstrous creatures or creepy mask-wearing spirits. Even Marianne takes on a new appearance when navigating the spirit world, the sleeve of her kickass jacket (she's so stylishly put together, I'm jealous as hell) and pant leg becoming frayed, as if this version of her is an incomplete, less-human being. But these two depictions of the world are not black and white opposites. Instead, the game posits that they exist as mirrors of one another--one manifesting literally what the other only hints at figuratively. And via this shared window into both perspectives, The Medium is able to explore the trauma of its characters through puzzle-solving and riddles.As you explore the Niwa Resort in search of Thomas, you'll stumble into areas where the emotional remnants of the world are so powerful, Marianne is forced to traverse the space in both the real and spiritual plane. At this point, your perspective is split, forcing you to look at and explore both worlds simultaneously. Navigating these spaces isn't straightforward, though--a staircase that's still present in the spirit world may have collapsed in the real world, or an empty hallway in the real world may be full of killer moths in the spirit world. And what affects Marianne in one world will do so in the other.These moments of dual-reality occur in a good third of the game, transforming areas into self-contained puzzle boxes where an understanding of the space is necessary for moving forward. For example, putting together certain items in the real world might spark memories that manifest as positive energy in the spirit world that Marianne can then absorb and use to power her supernatural abilities, such as a shield that can protect her from moths. As you continue, the puzzles become more elaborate, encouraging you to take a closer look at the environment in search of clues that might lead you toward the solution to the problem in front of you.The puzzles revolving around the dual-reality of Marianne's life are impressive in their technical achievement and the best part of the game. Bloober Team has spoken about how these moments are actually two different, wholly separate experiences running side by side, a feat the developer could not accomplish when The Medium was first conceptualized as an Xbox 360 game nor even made possible with the Xbox One. Only now, thanks to the powerful hardware and architecture of the Xbox Series X|S can the vision of what Bloober Team wanted for The Medium be realized--and it certainly is impressive. There are in-game ramifications beyond the visual splendor, too. Marianne is able to have an out-of-body experience, allowing you to control only her spirit form for a limited time. When this occurs, the game suspends the real world experience, giving you a chance to quickly explore previously inaccessible sections of the spirit world. When you're done, a brief flash of light hides a very fast load as spirit Marianne returns to the same position as real world Marianne and your controller connects to both versions again. It's incredible how seamlessly the two experiences link up to one another--it can't be any longer than a second or two.But beyond how cool it is to see Xbox's new hardware finally getting a console exclusive that accomplishes something that feels very ""next gen,"" these moments of dual reality also add to The Medium's gameplay. In order to solve a puzzle, for instance, you may need Marianne to be in two places at once or rely on the fact that she can essentially teleport from one place to another. One of my favorite moments in The Medium was when I came face to face with a monster during a moment of dual reality. I had an out-of-body experience and ran down a hallway, the creature chasing after my spirit form. Right before it caught me, I returned to my body, reloading spirit Miranne alongside real-world Marianne, who was able to physically interact with and cut through the chain locking the door, allowing both versions of Marianne to pass through just before my pursuer returned. It was a terrifying and thrilling moment.Regardless of whether they're a part of the dual reality sections or not, the puzzles are satisfying to solve--both for the sense of accomplishment and for how each one gives you a new glimpse into a world you're desperate to understand. Most puzzles require a level of spatial awareness or deductive reasoning; they're less about leaving you stumped and geared more toward smartly navigating spaces. So while you can't guess your way to success, figuring out what to do shouldn't trip you up for very long. And there's a great deal of incentive in solving each puzzle--prior to your arrival, the Niwa Resort suffered a horrifying incident in which almost everyone on the premises died but no one knows why. Journeying deeper into the resort begins to fill in those gaps, unveiling a mystery that compels you to push further through the horror in hopes of finding the answers you seek.Though most of the game revolves around puzzle-solving, there are stealth encounters and chase sequences in The Medium as well. Both of these stem from encounters with The Maw (voiced by Troy Baker), the main antagonist of the game. The Maw is a fairly straightforward chap who is very confident in letting others know what it desires--it wants to strip you down and live inside your skin... because reasons. These instances grant The Medium an opportunity to delve into more traditional horror game tropes, the kind that make it feel like your heart is going to explode out of your chest. And in this way, the fear of running into The Maw provides an ever-present tension.Any time you have the eureka moment of figuring out how to solve a puzzle, it's usually accompanied by the growing dread that you haven't seen The Maw in a while. And that feeling only grows worse once you notice that you now have to travel down a very long hallway to use the item you've just discovered to unlock the next area; it feels like it would be a real inopportune time for you if the creature were to show up, which probably means it's going to show up, whimpering about how cold it is and how you're being very selfish for not letting it try you on, and then growling with malicious glee upon spotting you and demanding you hold still so that it can have its way with your body. I'm not sure what well of horrific creativity that Troy Baker found in order to inform his performance, but we must ensure he never finds it again--he does way too good a job of making The Maw sound creepy as hell. I'm not even really sure how to describe the voice; it's as if a toddler that's struggling for air is cooing in your ear about being a serial killer. You just feel unclean listening to it. The Maw is a deeply unsettling antagonist, made all the more so because you go a great deal of the game not knowing why it wants to be inside you, but knowing that it can appear at almost any time.Thankfully, there are a few systems designed to ensure you don't always outright fail if you make a wrong turn during a chase sequence or accidently stop holding your breath while trying to sneak through a stealth section. When captured--provided you have spirit energy--you can emit a blast that temporarily stuns The Maw, allowing you to keep running or flee to a hiding spot. Marianne can't hold an endless supply of spirit energy (the amount is cleverly indicated by how much of her jacket sleeve is glowing, removing any need for a user interface) but you usually always have enough to escape at least once. So the first time you're caught, it's not necessarily a game over. That doesn't dispel the unnerving atmosphere when The Maw is nearby, of course, nor did it help my unease when exploring the resort, especially during the times when I hadn't had a chance to recharge Marianne's spirit energy in a while and was running dry.That feeling of unease is only heightened by how you're able to perceive The Medium's world. Bloober Team strips you of any agency over the camera, opting for a more cinematic experience where you're at the mercy of predetermined angles for every room. Often, you're forced to view a room from a less-than-ideal perspective; for example, with the camera facing Marianne head-on so that you can only see what's directly behind her, or a faraway shot that showcases just how big the room is and how vulnerable you are. To the game's credit, it's very effective for establishing the tone of every moment, allowing Bloober Team to orchestrate the same type of shot composition seen in well-choreographed horror films or cinematic horror games like Silent Hill.Occasionally, The Medium will combine both the cinematic nature of its shots and the dual reality of its setting to amplify climatic moments, such as extended chase sequences or significant conversations. My favorite examples are the series of talks between Marianne and Sadness, a mysterious spirit of a young girl who cannot remember who she is. Because Sadness is a spirit, she only exists in the spirit realm, and so it looks like the Marianne in the real world is talking to thin air. Bloober Team almost always uses this opportunity to great effect in order to show how Marianne and Sadness' relationship is evolving. For example, the side of the screen that focuses on real-world Marianne may remain as a close-up of her face so that you can read her microexpressions, but not see much else while the spirit world side may showcase how Marianne and Sadness are talking to one another. One camera reveals what Marianne is likely thinking while the other gives us a glimpse as to what she's reacting to.The sound design of The Medium is top-notch, too. Wood creaks beneath your feet, the thudding footsteps of The Maw reverberates into your ears when it's chasing you, and the sound of Marianne replenishing her spirit energy comes as a major relief. The soundtrack is no slouch either, as composers Arkadiusz Reikowski (Layers of Fear 2, Blair Witch) and Akira Yamaoka (the Silent Hill franchise) ensure the music creates a terrifying atmosphere and moments of silence deliver an unnerving one. The music and sounds of The Medium work beautifully (in the most frightening way) to amplify each scene, typically working in tandem with the odd angles of the camera to keep you in a perpetual state of freaking out, but also informing you of Marianne's current state.The Medium does a terrific job of storytelling without explicitly telling you what's going on, so it's disappointing when it goes out of its way to explicitly lay things out. Almost the entire game is a flashback of past events as Marianne recaps her harrowing journey through the Niwa Resort, narrating her innermost thoughts, feelings, and convictions during each moment. She's excessively vocal, often explaining revelations that do not need explaining because the game has already sufficiently established a situation. The most annoying instance of this is when Marianne comments on how she's feeling. Kelly Burke's stellar performance does much of the work in conveying Marianne's mental and emotional state, so getting narration about how she's feeling just after inferring it from the tone in her voice feels redundant. The Medium gives you everything you need to piece together its puzzles and narrative. But whereas it leaves you to solve the puzzles on your own, it goes too far in trying to ensure you never miss a beat of its story. Granted, this straightforward narration does act as a benefit for those that might not be able to pick up on certain visual or auditory cues, ensuring that the necessary information remains accessible, though it feels a bit inelegant in its implementation.The Medium's initial hook of finding Thomas in order to learn about Marianne's origins isn't all that interesting, but, as mentioned before, the walls of Niwa Resort hide many compelling secrets. Early on, you discover evidence of several seemingly unimportant but fascinating stories that speak to what transpired in the days leading up to the massacre that left Niwa Resort abandoned. Many of these stories tie into the puzzles--more often than not, deducing the identity of someone and understanding who they were is key to moving forward. Thus, to understand the puzzle in front of you, you need to empathize with those who once lived there to figure out how they ticked. Even if you can't fully comprehend the scope of their trauma, it's important to acknowledge it and try to understand how it may have shaped them.Two moments in particular stand out, as they involve getting at the heart of trauma that has been kept from others to see. These sections play out in unique dreamscapes inspired by the twisted subconscious mind of the individuals in question. They're both harrowing and intense--you're cutting away at the defenses that someone has erected against the most traumatic moments of their life, so it can occasionally feel like you're the monster in this scenario, triggering someone for no other reason than better understanding them for your own personal gain. But in both instances, you're entering the mind of victims that went on to become victimizers themselves, ones who wielded their trauma as an excuse for the horrific abuse they went on to enact on others.At the core of The Medium is the idea that there are usually always two ways of perceiving something or someone. The puzzles, dual reality gameplay, and overall story support this central theme, revealing instances of human behavior that showcase how bad deeds can occasionally have good motivations (or vice versa). In most instances, The Medium leaves it up to player interpretation as to whether someone was good or bad. The aforementioned sections where you dive into the psyche of abusers are the game's acknowledgement that there is an exception to how much agency you have in how you judge someone, even when there are two sides of a story. In both cases, Marianne outright rejects the use of a miserable or abusive upbringing to forgive evil actions. You can feel bad for a villain on account of what happened to them, but that doesn't mean you should ever forgive what they did. It's an important distinction and one I'm glad the game makes, utilizing both an example of an abuser who accidently shielded their guilt with their trauma and one who purposely did so, in order to make the point that both instances are not okay. The latter is far worse, but neither is inexcusable.And I think therein lies why The Medium works as well as it does. It's a horror game--no doubt about that. I have a whole camera reel of screenshots of the times the game scared me so bad I tried to pause it to compose myself, only to hit the screenshot button by mistake. But if anything, it feels more like a game about the aftermath of horror, and how living with unresolved trauma can create nightmares as damaging as the initial event. As scary as it is to be chased by a monster, it's the terrifying display of how one traumatizing act--even after it's been justly punished--can still create such a ripple effect that, years later, it continues to affect the victim, those around them, and even complete strangers. The Medium posits that there is no single victim in a traumatic event, and then through its characters and environmental storytelling, builds proofs to its hypothesis that are difficult to disagree with.Eventually The Medium's narrative threads begin to weave together, even connecting to the original goal of discovering Marianne's origins. The promise that everything somehow connects in some unforeseen and fascinating way is a thrilling reason to see the game all the way through. The connections to real-world events of Polish history make many of the revelations even more poignant--even if the supernatural aspects are fictional, it's deeply unsettling to think about how some of the evil present in this game did actually occur.And to that end, The Medium's conclusion sticks with you; it's one last horrifying reminder that trauma may not define a person, but it can have consequences we can't even begin to foresee if it's not adequately dealt with and simply left to fester over time. I can't say I enjoyed the ending to The Medium, but I am deeply satisfied with how it sets up the inescapable nature of its horrifying conclusion.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"
Kotaku,"The Medium is stuck between two types of video games. It seems like a throwback to classic, claustrophobic horror titles such as Silent Hill and Resident Evil, but it also feels like a more modern non-combat, narrative-focused scary game. The end result is a game that feels middle of the road. This is disappointing, because it contains some great ideas and has a strong second half. But too much of the game buries these bright spots under stretches of boredom.(This review was originally published on Jan. 27, 2021. With the release of The Medium on PS5 we’ve updated and republished our original review.) Developed by Bloober Team, the horror specialists behind Layers of Fear and the recent Blair Witch game, The Medium is something different. Where those previous games were focused on first-person gameplay, The Medium is a third-person game that uses static camera angles, giving the game a retro-feel. Adding to this feeling, the entire storyline of the game is set in Poland during the late-90s when classic survival horror games like Silent Hill were popular.In The Medium, you play as Marianne, a woman who is also a medium, able to connect and interact with dead people, their spirits, and the “other side.” In fact, she can actually traverse the other side of reality, directly interacting with the dead and helping them move on. This is a major part of the game, with the screen splitting in two, as you play in both the real world and spirit world at the same time. In action, it’s impressive and might be one of the reasons this game is only playable on the new Xbox Series X and S and not the Xbox One, as I assume rendering two worlds at once takes extra power older machines might lack.The game starts after the death of Marianne’s adoptive father. She gets a mysterious phone call from someone at Newa, an abandoned government-run vacation lodge. Once she arrives, it becomes clear that this place hides some dark secrets and a lot of suffering. Quickly, using your powers, you befriend a young girl who goes by the name of Sadness and who helps guide you around Newa, as you meet other, nastier spirits and characters. Along the way, a dangerous entity known only as The Creature hunts you down, both in the spirit world and the real world. To stop this deadly monster and help Sadness move on, you’ll have to uncover all the deep, dark secrets of Newa and confront your own past. Doing so involves a lot of door and key puzzles.The Medium’s story takes a while to get anywhere, with the first half filled with vagueness, cliches. But once the creature begins showing up more and I learned about Sadness and her family, The Medium’s tale hooked me. Then the ending, which feels rushed, brought back my disappointment, as it ends in all too vague a manner. Boo! Don’t make me care about your characters, world, and story only to pull the plug at the last minute and leave me hanging.I try to not spoil games too much when reviewing them, but I do feel obligated to mention that a part of the game’s narrative involves a pedophile and their victim as well as that person’s history. Their connection to the story is impossible to ignore and while the game never shares explicit details or imagery, thankfully, it’s still alluded to and mentioned multiple times. It’s all gross and sadly never gets fully resolved. Consider this a content warning. If pedophilia, even minor mentions or references to it, is something you want to avoid, and I don’t blame you, The Medium is probably a game you should skip. To reach the unsatisfying conclusion, you’ll have to play through a lot of empty areas and backtracking-based puzzles. Do you like searching for keys and levers over and over? I hope so, because that’s a lot of what you do in this game. Another issue is that The Medium’s main creature is scary, but is also the only real threat in the entire game. That lack of a threat, combined with the simplistic puzzle design, makes too much of the game a bore. There are no random zombies or ghostly demons to fight. There’s essentially no-combat at all, outside of some areas that have you burning ghost moths with spirit energy. This means a lot of time is spent running around larger-than-necessary levels, with no threat of death or failure, trying to desperately find the one small item needed to press forward. Often, any feelings of fear quickly turned to frustration and boredom as I searched around maze-like areas looking for a valve or small piece of paper. The static cameras don’t help, as I often found myself getting lost in some areas when the camera wildly flipped to a new angle or didn’t flip soon enough, so I watched as my character walked off-screen.""Excuse Me, Creepy Ghost Monster, I’m Looking For A Valve.”Reality-Bending-Psychological-Horror Split reality system, second half of the story, visualsBad start, ambiguous ending, dull puzzles, backtracking and performance issuesBloober TeamJanuary 28, 2021Xbox Series X (Played), Xbox Series S, PS5, PC9 hoursThe real saving grace for The Medium and its mediocre puzzles is the use of the spirit world. This is the big hook, and it’s genuinely cool and fresh. Throughout The Medium, Marrianne will occasionally “split” herself between two realms. One is the boring real world, the other is a strange dimension that looks a lot like Hell as it appeared in the Keanu Reeves film Constantine. One Marrianne stays in the real world while another ghostly one explores, at the same time, the spirit realm.The two-world system spices up what would have been more plain puzzles. For example, in the real world, there might be a locked door, but in the spirit world, it’s an open entryway. So you can temporarily leave your body and walk around as just a spirit, potentially unlocking a new path or getting an item you needed from the spirit world to the real world. Other times you’ll need to find something in the real world to unlock a path or item in the spirit world.Sadly, I never felt like the game truly took advantage of its two-reality system. There’s no big final level that tests all your spirit world knowledge and skills. And that might be because outside of a few instances where you use your spirit self to shoot some energy or burn some moths, there’s not much else to do in the game. You walk around, you pick up stuff, you read some notes and in a few small instances, you get some cutscenes through the eyes of someone else. This simplicity, coupled with a lack of combat, one enemy who is fairly easy to avoid and areas that look good but are filled with the same puzzles over and over made me lose interest.It’s a shame, because I did enjoy the world Bloober Team had created and many of the cutscenes were fantastic. I also dug the idea of playing in two different realities at once. But so much of The Medium just didn’t connect with me. Horror games shouldn’t be boring or frustrating, yet that’s what I felt a lot over the nine hours it took to finish the game. Some wonky controls and performance issues didn’t help improve things either.In a different reality, I could see this game being something special. And it might, like so many other horror games and movies, go on to become a cult classic. But in this realm, for me, it just doesn’t come together. "

The Medium review for Xbox Series X|S and PC.The Medium is Bloober Team’s most ambitious title so far, but it sticks close to the studio’s roots. Initially announced in 2012, it was shelved to allow the technology to develop so the studio could tell the story it wanted to without compromise.The ability to interact with two separate instances of a game world simultaneously, dubbed the Dual-Reality System, is The Medium‘s unique gimmick, which sets it apart from its horror contemporaries. This gameplay mechanic was the primary aspect of the game that was highlighted pre-release, but the big question was whether or not this would enrich its narrative or if it would be little more than fluff.In The Medium, a spirit world lies parallel to the real world. Within the realm of spirits, emotion and intent are made physical. Though the two planes can interact with each other, they remain almost wholly separate as a rule. Our protagonist, Marianne, breaks this rule by existing as a single entity in two worlds. For her, the spiritual plane can be as easily explored and manipulated as the real world.After her adoptive father’s death, Marianne receives a phone call beckoning her to Niwa Resort by Thomas, a man who claims to know her secret. Having sought answers as to why she has her powers, she makes her way to the long-abandoned facility. Upon her arrival, she becomes caught up in the aftermath of a tragedy that occurred there two decades before.The Medium is a psychological horror game, Bloober Team’s specialty. However, unlike Layers of Fear 2 and Blair Witch, the plot is more grounded. Despite the fantastical notion of a spirit world, the game establishes a natural relationship between the two planes that follows specific rules. Marianne’s issue is that she, and the remaining inhabitants of Niwa Resort, don’t follow these rules.Shortly after arriving at Niwa, Marianne is confronted with The Maw, an entity that is her opposite. This twisted creature originates in the spirit world but can manifest into the real world, at least for a while. It becomes evident after meeting it that The Maw intends to inhabit Marianne’s body so that it can finally fully enter the real world. Its origin and how to defeat it is a central thread of the game’s story.I enjoyed The Medium more than Bloober Team’s most recent efforts, Layers of Fear 2 and Blair Witch. The story is more grounded and relies more on traditional horror techniques to build and maintain suspense. Bloober Team has relied too much on disorienting the player by rapidly switching environments and surreal elements in the past, and I’m glad that both of those narrative tools are almost entirely absent.Unfortunately, the pacing is off. The game starts slow, and it wasn’t until around a quarter of the way through that it really started drawing me in. From there, the story was a crescendo that unfortunately dropped entirely off a cliff-edge in the last 20 minutes of the game. This is far from an issue that affects this studio, though. Many works of horror fumble the climax. However, the ending is an absolute letdown, which made me question the rest of the game’s validity.I’m not someone who needs everything explained to me. I love theory-crafting and what-ifs. However, The Medium leaves the major plotlines of the game unfinished for seemingly no reason. You get to the goal, the mystery has been solved, and you’re just waiting for the denouement when the curtain drops.Ambiguity works best when one or more plot points are open to interpretation, but The Medium ties everything together fairly neatly by the time you reach the end. This makes its lack of resolution incredibly unsatisfying, rather than intriguing and memorable.The environments in The Medium are excellent, especially considering that most of them had to be designed twice. The derelict Niwa resort combines Soviet brutalism with the haunting pastels of family-friendly design. The gray of the real world resort contrasts with the spirit realm’s organic browns and fleshy tones.Seeing an environment in two variations is fascinating. Twisted metal and ruins in the real-world are bone and sinew in the spirit realm. A good portion of the game allows players to interact with both versions, and especially toward its finale, some puzzles require players to move between the two multiple times to solve them.The inspiration the devs took from surrealist Polish painter Zdzisław Beksiński is evident when playing, as the spirit world is almost directly lifted from his paintings. I hope the game brings Beksiński to some new fans, as his work was on par with H.R. Giger, an artist who has been the inspiration for a variety of games over the years.The spirits found throughout Niwa, including The Maw, are haunting and appropriately creepy. The friendlier ones still have decay about them, with crumbling flesh and roughly-hewn porcelain masks. On the other hand, the Maw has a powerful but horrific vitality about it, signifying its strength and ability to exist within both worlds. Troy Baker does an excellent job with the vocals of The Maw, who torments Marianne by beckoning her to let it wear her skin. The creature gives a real Buffalo Bill from Silence of the Lambs vibe, which never failed to make me uncomfortable.The Medium makes use of fixed camera angles to heighten its scares. I’ve always been a fan of fixed camera angles in horror games because it lets the devs show you precisely what they want you to see. The limited viewpoint allows for excellent use of light and shadow, and The Medium‘s use of raytracing enhances that effect. However, raytracing isn’t required to make the game look beautiful. I found that RTX was glitchy for me on PC, likely because a The Medium-specific driver hasn’t been released yet by Nvidia. I turned it off, and the pre-baked lighting is still excellent.The Medium falls short in the time between its puzzles. It’s very linear, which means you’re only able to explore within each little box it puts you in. You basically move from one “puzzle box” to another throughout the game, with corridors linking them. There would be inventory management and combat in a survival horror title to soak up part of this time and keep the suspense up, but here there’s nothing but walking.Because The Medium has no traditional combat, the pacing can become uneven outside of the stealth, puzzle-solving, and exposition. Even the stealth sections are brief and act more like puzzles than anything else. It ends up taking some of the suspense away, as there are clear demarcations between when Marianne is in danger and when she’s safe.When you’re trying to get away from The Maw, you’ll inevitably find something to shock it with or a hole in a wall to crawl into, and the creature will just give up. The Maw is meant to seem like an ever-present danger, but the limited gameplay design leaves it toothless.The split worlds mechanic in The Medium isn’t revolutionary, but it’s something I’d like to see again in a future title. The environments and the interplay between the real and spirit worlds are what makes this game unique, and it’s worth playing through it just to experience the excellent visuals and puzzles.The Medium is a step in the right direction for Bloober Team and I hope that it’s a sign that the studio is moving out of its comfort zone. It’s definitely the most dynamic title from the devs so far. At its best times, The Medium channels Silent Hill, but the rough pacing and limited gameplay outside of puzzle-solving hold it back. Additionally, the unsatisfactory ending leaves a sour note that detracts from the overall experience.7Jason Faulkner is Evolve Media's Senior SEO Editor.

Destructoid,"darkI respect Bloober Team’s persistence in the realm of psychological horror games. They’re not for everyone, and I understand the complaints that their games lack a certain impact, but I like ’em okay.The Medium, Bloober Team’s latest release following the back-to-back Layers of Fear 2 and Blair Witch, feels higher-profile. The horror-adventure game has been pushed quite a bit as an early Xbox Series X/S title due in large part to its distinct “two worlds” split-screen concept, but it’s also out on PC.That’s where I played it, and after seeing the recommended specs, I was surprised to have pretty good performance with my setup: an i7-7700K, GTX 1080 Ti, 16 GB RAM, and SSD. I didn’t have to make too many visual compromises at 1080p. Whether Marianne was in the spirit world, the real world, or she was inhabiting both realities at the same time side-by-side, the game ran consistently well for me.But apart from The Medium working on a technical level, is its world worth exploring? Is it actually scary? And what about those stealth encounters with a trash-talking demon voiced by Troy Baker?The Medium (PC [reviewed], Xbox Series X/S) Developer: Bloober Team Publisher: Bloober Team Released: January 28, 2021 MSRP: $49.99 (Also included with Xbox Game Pass) If those were your concerns coming in, I hear you. Same! Quote unquote “horror games” can mean so many different things these days. I also recognize that composer Akira Yamaoka’s involvement in The Medium has roped in Silent Hill fans, some of whom may not know exactly what they’re getting into.This team has a knack for creating creepy scenarios that sound cool on paper – in this case, a medium who can exist in the land of the living and the dead simultaneously and channel spirit energy – but those fresh ideas don’t always make it to the finish line. Without compelling gameplay to back it up, a cool hook can fade away. I’d argue that there’s just enough going on here to keep players engaged.It’s the late ’90s, and Marianne is summoned from her home in Krakow to investigate the remote Niwa Hotel – a resort that was abandoned years ago after a bizarre massacre. The old compound has a lot of skeletons in its closet, and as a medium who can glean insight from left-behind objects, Marianne needs to piece together what happened at Niwa, who the players are, and eventually, how she fits in.The Medium is very much in line with Bloober Team’s past work, for better and for worse. By that I mean it once again blurs the line between psychological horror and walking sim. There’s one jump-scare, a few quick chase sequences, and several not-too-taxing stealth bits. Otherwise, it’s weirdly low-key.[brid video=”708972″ player=”12899″ title=”The%20Medium%20Review” duration=”397″ description=”In today’s Destructoid Review, we’re getting in touch with our spooky spiritual side with The Medium! Is it worth the journey, or should we just hit up our nearest ouija board? Find out!Version played: PC (Also available on PS4, PS5, Stadia, Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X)Developer: Bloober TeamPublisher: Bloober TeamReleased: January 28, 2021MSRP: $49.99 (Also included with Xbox Game Pass)” uploaddate=”2021-01-27″ thumbnailurl=”//cdn.brid.tv/live/partners/10260/thumb/708972_t_1611774124.jpg” contentUrl=”//cdn.brid.tv/live/partners/10260/sd/708972.mp4″]Much of the experience is spent strolling around, stress-free, to try and find a path forward in the material world or spirit realm. Thankfully, it’s atmospheric. Sometimes you’ll need to leave your physical body behind to circumvent an obstacle or find a particular item for a particular piece of scenery that can help Marianne tap into a power source. Mechanically, you can expect to inspect a lot of items and listen to audio tidbits that cover past events. The Medium has a few true puzzles, but the rest don’t push back in a meaningful way. There’s no tricky resource management to worry about and there’s no combat.To elaborate, you occasionally will need to sprint away from a recurring demon that wants to wear you as a “skinsuit” – but those moments feel heavily scripted, and they don’t last long. As for the stealth sequences, The Maw is blind in the real world, so there’s no reason whatsoever to rush. I didn’t struggle to sneak by the creature like I thought I might based on the trailers. I will say though, its theme is legit.In some ways, I appreciate the simplicity of this game. You’re never going to feel too lost or unsure about what to do. Items are easy to spot with a “detective vision” Insight ability to outline them. And if you ever grow tired of Marianne’s frequent narration (for the record: I didn’t), you can skip her lines.At the same time, I feel like The Medium could’ve asked far more from its players. It’s too passive. It never throws you in the deep end, so your nerves never really kick in. The game’s main hook, the dual reality split-screen presentation where you control two versions of Marianne at once, looks cooler than it is. These moments are always pre-defined, meaning you won’t manually activate her ability. At most, you’ll have to protect yourself from otherworldly moths using a spirit shield. There aren’t threats to watch out for other than the demon antagonist, and even then, those sequences are self-contained.Apart from a short opening sequence at her adoptive father’s funeral home and a few other areas I won’t spoil, The Medium mostly takes place in and around the abandoned Niwa Hotel complex.It’s a testament to the visual presentation and the snowballing mystery that I never wanted to put this game down. As an adventure game with few if any scary moments and little in the way of intensity, I’m sure it’s not going to click with all horror fans. There’s no way it will. That said, there’s something about The Medium‘s modernized rendition of classic fixed camera angles that I truly enjoyed. It felt cozy.I captured an absurd amount of screenshots – more than I ever could or would use in a review. That goes for the hotel’s dilapidated interiors, the beautifully grotesque ghostscapes, and the scenic woods. Even if my interactions with the world left me wanting, I still had a generally good time exploring it.The Medium took me almost exactly eight hours to finish, and I got most but not all of the optional lore collectibles. While one playthrough was plenty for me, I’m still dwelling on the bigger picture and how everything fits together. Poland is an interesting historical backdrop, one that doesn’t feel like an afterthought. And even though this is largely Marianne’s personal story – much more than expected – it does ultimately branch out. If you care to look, there are world-building dots to consider and connect.I wanted a whole lot more from the split-reality premise, though. I wanted higher stakes. Tension. If this game felt threatening, I’d have a very different outlook. As is, I think it’s decent. Enjoyable enough.My favorite part of The Medium ended up being its “semi-fixed cameras,” which blend old and new design philosophies in a way that seems genuinely palatable in 2021. That’s the real achievement here. I can easily picture a more well-rounded sequel happening, and for what it’s worth, I hope it does.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]AlrightSlightly above average or simply inoffensive. Fans of the genre should enjoy them a bit, but a fair few will be left unfulfilled.

Shacknews,"New to Shacknews? Signup for a Free AccountAlready have an account? Login NowBloober Team's most ambitious game yet rips back the veil between reality and the spirit world. But is the world beyond worth exploring? Going into Bloober Team’s latest title, I really wasn’t sure what to expect. To say that the developer’s take on horror has evolved and changed throughout its projects would be a bit of an understatement. From the jump-scares of the original Layers of Fear, to the murky and tense world of Observer, the studio has made a name for itself on several different sides of the horror spectrum. With The Medium, though, the team seems to forego the past focuses on jump scares, and instead focuses on a style of horror reminiscent of the Silent Hill games and the original Resident Evil.In The Medium, players step into the shoes of a woman named Marianne, who is a literal medium that can connect with the spirit world. Shortly after the death of a loved one, Marianne receives a mysterious phone call, beckoning her to the remains of an old Polish work camp. From here, players are thrust into a dark mystery as they work to uncover the secrets behind the Niwa (pronounced Niva) work camp, including what happened to the camp’s occupants several years earlier.Unlike Blair Witch, or the previous titles the team has released, The Medium goes for more of a fixed camera angle than a true third-person or first-person angle. This constricts the player's view quite a bit, and while I found that being unable to look around the environments as freely as I wanted was annoying at times—the environments here are easily the best part of the game—the constriction caused by the fixed angles helped drive the amount of tension up throughout the entirety of the game.The camera setup feels really good as you explore the Niwa resort, which is put together quite meticulously. The amount of detail in the world is astounding and really helps bring the abandoned location to life as you move through each of its shadowy rooms. Flickering lights and strange sounds amplify the tension that is present, only helping to further escalate the anxiety that is already growing in your gut as you dig deeper.It doesn’t take long for Marianne to meet her first friend, a little girl named Sadness, a character that might seem unimportant at first, but soon helps push the player deeper into the horrors that await.Bloober Team wastes no time in throwing players into its new dual-reality gameplay, which sees Marianne exploring both the physical world and a weird spirit world at the same time. In most cases this breaks up the gameplay into a format similar to split screen, and it makes for a really interesting way to explore the environments the developers have worked so hard on. This feature is used predominantly throughout the game, so players need to get used to focusing on both scenes very quickly.For the most part, experiencing the game in dual reality is fine. It allows you to go into what Bloober Team calls “out of body” experiences, which lets you explore the spirit world and get past barriers you can’t move in the real world. It’s a unique way to diversify the game’s puzzles and opens the door for some unusual solutions.Despite the perks dual reality does get annoying at certain times, especially during intense chase scenes. Focusing on both sides of the screen at the same time is extremely difficult when you’re focused on getting away from the game's main enemy, The Maw. This often led to me running into walls and getting caught, which forced me to retry from a predetermined save point, something that was often several minutes behind where I died. It was a minor annoyance, but one that grew as the chase scenes continued through the game.One thing that The Medium does really well is atmosphere. The best horror games focus on atmosphere and ambiance to jack up the anxiety in its players and Bloober Team does a really good job this time around. Unlike some horror games which focus on jump scares and other cheap tactics, The Medium is absolutely rife with tension that only builds as players explore. The sounds of dripping water and footsteps as you move through the abandoned halls of Niwa are fantastic and really help drive the fear that rules that place home.There are a lot of callbacks to horror classics like Resident Evil and the Silent Hill games, with much of the music sometimes feeling like it was ripped straight out out of the Silent Hill OST. Audio design is one of the best ways to push a horror game to the next level, and The Medium delivers in almost all aspects of that particular category.These highs are pockmarked with lows, though, and all the good comes to a grinding halt as players dig deeper into Marianne’s story.The Medium tries to tell a deep and meaningful story that lets players connect to the characters and experience their heartache. Unfortunately, it’s never really sure what it wants to do. There are times where the players are completely ripped from controlling Marianne as they explore other characters and it just feels like a cheap way to go about expanding on that part of her story.There are also a lot of instances of what writers call telling and not showing. This is something that can completely ruin a story, as the audience doesn’t get to discover things for themselves, nor are they given a chance to come to that conclusion. Instead, the game simply says it is, so it must be. There were quite a few big story reveals that felt hollow because of this, and it’s something I’d love to see developers stepping away from, especially in story-driven titles like The Medium.At its core, The Medium does a good job of offering a unique take on the old, haunted location tropes. There are some nice twists, and while they don’t reach their full potential, they do tell a decent story. Unfortunately, all of the good bits of the story are wasted on an unfulfilling ending that feels rushed. The game drops its biggest twist and then you’re immediately walking into the ending without any chance to digest it. This is further made worse by an after-credits cutscene that almost feels like Bloober Team leaving the story open for a sequel.Despite the wrong steps, there is good in The Medium. If you want a decent horror story to wade through, which offers telltale signs of the classics we’ve come to know and love, then Bloober Team’s latest is just that. There are mistakes along the way, and some things could have been done better, but ultimately The Medium feels like a game that meets you in the middle, straddling the line between mediocre and really good.This review is based on a PC code provided by the publisher.

VG247,"Bloober Team's latest goes under the microscope in our The Medium review.The Medium isn't really the game I thought it was. Maybe I should have been paying closer attention to Bloober Team's Xbox Series X|S and PC exclusive, but this is an old-school horror game through the lens of next-gen power and possibilities. This isn't a triple-A game, it's a bit rough at points, it's heavy on story over action, and might come across to some as mechanically archaic, but for many reasons The Medium clicked with me. This isn't an exclusive Xbox fans will scream about on social media, but it's one that the right audience will find is a sometimes gorgeous, impressively atmospheric tale.It didn't take long to be taken back to the original Alone in the Dark, Ecstatica, and even Resident Evil. The unexpected arguably begins with the camera, which is fixed, with the shot switching to the most useful for atmospheric and gameplay purposes. The Medium is also almost entirely devoid of combat. The threat that exists is mild, the puzzles are neat if not genius, and sometimes you walk awkwardly in the wrong direction because the camera shot changed. But, I enjoyed almost every moment - as much as you can enjoy a game about the darkest of secrets and their painful discovery.Marianne is troubled. Not only has her foster father Jack recently died, but her head is full of visions. These nightmares prove to be more than manifestations of her mind, with Marianne able to see a parallel spirit world. This is The Medium's big hook, as for large chunks of the game you get to see both worlds side by side, Marianne moving through each in split-screen, and interacting with objects as they appear in each world. It's far from a gimmick, with key characters living in the spirit world, and some puzzles tied to how you play in both simultaneously. It looks damn cool.To help you navigate through the puzzles you have access to a number of skills only people with Marianne's skillset are capable of. As well as being able to conjure an energy shield (useful to move through swarms of moths) and energy blasts (one shock in spirit land will power a device in the normal world), Marianne can use an enhanced vision mode to spot hidden objects while in our world.While most spirit world gameplay sees you controlling Marianne in both worlds, which never gets old, you can activate an out of body experience and control her just in the spirit world. This mode is time-limited so you can't roam around indefinitely, but it's another smart way to add more variety to puzzles. Other than one moment early on, and some late-game headscratchers (which only required a little extra thought) the challenge here isn't high, but it's enough. The Medium isn't a game that really puts up a fight. You're on a journey to find out the truth rather than find out if you're an expert gamer. I was happy with that.Story is a key part of The Medium, so you won't find any spoilers here. What can be said is that Bloober has done a great job crafting a multi-generation, multi-reality yarn that all comes together nicely as key plot points start to unravel. The storytelling itself is the studio at its best yet, and benefits from excellent vocal performances from Mary Elizabeth McGlynn, Troy Baker, and others.As a next-gen Xbox console exclusive a lot of attention will be on The Medium's graphics. Even though Bloober Team isn't a triple-A studio (and isn't shy about saying as much), comparisons to other exclusives on the new consoles will be plentiful and likely vociferous. While no doubt unfair to put this smaller effort up against mega-budget titles, at points The Medium is able to handle itself extremely well. There's some superbly lit scenes on offer, and the woodland environment (especially when you also see the hellish spirit world alongside it) is often gorgeous. But it's not all up to that standard.I played on Xbox Series X and the frame rate didn't seem silky smooth. There's also a fair bit of detail and texture load-in - something I'd hoped the SSDs in these new consoles would eliminate - and a varying mix of art quality on show throughout. Parts of this game are wonderful to look at, and give me confidence that Bloober will one day rival some of the industry's heavy hitters, but others feel bland and uninspired. There's also a fairly common slight disconnect with the player character and the world itself, although again this is sometimes exacerbated by the look of the environment.These blemishes shouldn't put you off what is still technically an extremely impressive game. The way the two worlds are displayed alongside each other, Marianne moving identically in each, is awesome. So too is the way you can sometimes trigger a complete switch between worlds. It's not dissimilar to how you can flick between old-school and modern visuals in the Halo remasters, but it's more impressive here seeing as both worlds look impressive.If you're after action and full-on horror, The Medium will likely leave you wanting, and considerably so. This is more of a slow burn, the twisted plot unravelling over six to eight hours. I found the pacing to be ideal, with the game throwing just enough moments of high intensity into the mix to keep things interesting. There is a big bad of sorts, but don't expect traditional boss fights, with encounters being designed to be intimidating and scary rather than difficult. Bloober clearly wanted everyone to be able to see this story through to its conclusion.A lack of exclusive titles for Xbox Series X|S has put an overly harsh spotlight on The Medium, and I hope it won't result in unfair criticism. No, this isn't a production up to the level you might expect from Naughty Dog or The Coalition. This is an indie game that's performing on the biggest stage, and for the most part it's put on quite the show.

God is a Geek,"September 3, 2021It feels like ages ago that The Medium released on Xbox’s next -gen console. At the time, Bloober Team’s supernatural adventure was an exclusive title to the X and S. Microsoft had been pretty slim on games for their fancy new consoles, but this one was theirs…until PlayStation revealed they were getting it, too. Now, owners of the PS5 get to see what all the fuss was about. While it’s still pretty much the same game, The Medium gets to make use of the DualSense controller in pretty much every way imaginable.CHECK THIS OUT: Far Cry 6 changes the series in a meaningful way | 6 hours of hands-onIf you’re unfamiliar with the story, it follows a spirit medium known as Marianne. You see, she’s been having some pretty messed up dreams, and after getting a phone call from a man known as Thomas, she heads to an abandoned holiday resort to find the answers about what her dream means as well as the origin of her powers. The Medium has a solid story, taking the player in different directions throughout. It can be terrifying, unnerving, and moving. There’s a claustrophobic dread as you explore Niwa, the resort, and uncover the alleged massacre that happened there.Marianne has a lot of different powers. She can split herself between the real world and the spirit world where you control them both at the same time. To power up broken switches and generators, she can use Spirit Blast to send a charge of power from her fingertips. Not only that, but she can have out-of-body experiences, use a Spirit Shield to protect herself, and hear memories of the past simply by looking at an object. It features some clever mechanics, but now The Medium is on PS5, the DualSense brings them to life.The haptic feedback plays a pivotal role in immersing you in the game. When using your Spirit Shield, you feel every flutter of a moth’s wings rattling through your hands. Running over different terrain varies depending on whether it’s a woodland, a cracked floor, or the messed up spirit world. When you have your out-of-body experience, the controller rumbles when you’re about to die, with pulsing becoming more frequent and heavier. It’s also impressive when you have to hold your breath, as vibrations are more aggressive as you struggle for air.As for the adaptive triggers, they work great with the Spirit Blast. The resistance builds as you charge it, then loosens off as you let go. Mostly, the technology does a fantastic job of bringing you into the action, but running is pretty frustrating. Almost every time you hold L2 to run, it clicks as you do so. It doesn’t matter if you’re in an open space or confined to a small room. It’s by no means a gamechanger, but I found it annoying, choosing to walk much more often as a result.CHECK THIS OUT: Lost in Random is a smart and beautiful platformer | Hands-on previewThe audio from the controller is pretty cool, especially when listening to memories. The first time I noticed it in gameplay was after holding a shoe that revealed the screams of those involved in the ‘Niwa massacre.’ Not going to lie, I almost soiled myself. The lightbar is also reactive when using your flashlight, letting you know if any creatures are close to you. All these little touches make The Medium on PS5 the best place to play it.Many of the lingering issues still persist, such as slow running and seeing in the dark, but it’s still a fantastic game. The story is great, and the puzzles are so smart. Bloober Team has been a hit-or-miss studio. Saying that, The Medium is easily their best yet, behind Observer. It captures fear in an inventive way, and makes fantastic use of the PS5’s wonderful controller. These improvements don’t feel tagged on or arbitrary. It allows you to immerse yourself in the world in new ways, and experience The Medium in a way the Xbox Series X just can’t provide.Much of the DualSense support is fantastic
Great story
Inventive puzzles
Looks gorgeousRunning is still slow
Adaptive triggers when running are irritatingThe Medium on PS5 is as good as it was on Xbox Series X, however, with DualSense support it becomes a much more immersive game.
