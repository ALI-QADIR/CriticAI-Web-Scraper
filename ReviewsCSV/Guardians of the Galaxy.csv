Eurogamer,"All over the space.I'm not sure what Guardians of the Galaxy wants to be.On one hand, it's a wonderfully accessible adventure wrapped up in family-friendly packaging, with an action-packed storyline that takes you on a delightful voyage through some of the galaxy's most colourful climes. On the other, it boasts an aggressively complex combat system that requires a high degree of digit-dexterity and rarely forgives your mistakes.On a third hand (well, we're literally in alien territory here, so indulge me), the game routinely pastes together blistering action sequences with monotonous walk-down-this-corridor scenes, rambling exposition, and a generous dollop of tedious teamster ""banter"" on the side. It makes for an extraordinarily uneven experience that means you're usually only doing one of two things in Guardians of the Galaxy: getting your arse kicked by a cube of jelly; or being somewhere en-route to getting your arse kicked, listening to the other Guardians squabble.That's not to say I didn't enjoy my time with Guardians of the Galaxy, though. Admittedly, during the earlier chapters, I actively did not have fun. As much as I liked getting to know the cast (which I come to as an MCU noob having - GASP! - never seen the movies), it felt like the game was doing all it could to keep me from getting immersed in its world-building. And it is a story worth hearing, by the way. Whilst the forced banter and arguments you're compelled to wade through feel a tad inelegant at times, the story of how Star-Lord Peter Quill and the rest of the Guardians - Drax, Gamora, Groot, and Rocket - come to save the galaxy this time around is a predictable, if curiously poignant, tale of love and loss... although the emotional impact of its climax dissolves pretty swiftly when you're forced into an infuriating final boss fight. To touch too deeply on the story will teeter into spoiler territory, so I promise I won't do that here, or even list the names of the characters and creatures you square up against (mainly because I have no idea who or what may be surprises taken directly from the cinematic universe). I can say, however, that in atonement for straying into a Quarantine Zone and being caught carrying contraband, the Guardians are forced to pay a hefty fine that, even collectively, the unmerry band of outcasts can ill afford. And so our story begins.The trouble is, despite its PG-13 presentation and wondrously peculiar lifeforms - there's no blood, gore, or overt violence here, and I wasn't joking when I said one of the enemy types you take on is a cube of jelly - Guardians of the Galaxy's combat is tough and its enemies frustratingly spongey. Not only can you punch foes, but you can shoot them, fire elemental shots, perform special attacks, instruct your teammates to attack, tell them to dole out special attacks, or deploy the ultimate power move by having all of the Guardians attack at once. That sounds cool enough - and it is when it works out - but a lot of the time, there's so much visual noise and noise noise that it's hard to keep track of what's going on on-screen. Add in environment traps, electric mines, stagger meters, mystical shields, and a broken health recovery system - Quill will merrily collect health drops around him regardless of whether or not he needs them, which means when you do need them, they're all gone - and I found myself succumbing to the bad guys with embarrassing frequency. Oh, and for good measure, the Guardians refuse to revive each other too (there's one notable exception, but that's straying into spoiler territory again), so you're often fighting the ""heal"" button prompt as much as the enemies themselves. It's a tightly controlled experience, though, one that whizzes you through the story on rails with zero opportunities to explore off the beaten path. In some ways, it's hard to fault the game for that - Guardians of the Galaxy is a gorgeous looking game that boasts some truly stunning vignettes by forcing your perspective; I took 280 screenshots - but it does mean there's little merit in turning left when the others turn right. Most of the time you'll uncover a dead end rather than a secret collectable. ""There's a lot here that Eidos can be proud of, but those things are hard to find amongst an oversaturation of systems and mechanics.""And there's so much else - maybe too much else? Quick time events. Wwwwwoooaaaahhhh! slide sequences. Real-time combat. Environmental puzzles. Momentum streaks. Team takedowns. Spaceship battles and chases. Watchdog-esque hacking sequences. Swappable outfits. Dialogue choices, but I don't think they have a bearing on the outcome of the game. Unlockable perks, but I gathered enough resources to unlock all but one in my first playthrough. Ability points, but there's not a lot of those, either, even though you can unlock new abilities for Gamora and the lads as well as Quill. But wait, there's more! An obnoxious visor that coats your surroundings in a sickly hot pink glow to help discover lore, resources, or tips on what to do next, but I often found it unreliable, failing to properly choreograph my next steps. It's great that Edios has worked so hard to keep gameplay fresh, sure, but the downside of this is that you're never certain what the hell you're supposed to do next. If you're stuck and can't progress, is it because you haven't instructed a Guardian to do something or do you need to do it yourself? The most curious of all, however, is the Guardians' huddle, which unceremoniously yanks you from the fight into a first-person point-of-view to gee up - or calm down - your squaddies. To be successful, you need to listen to them - some will be cock-sure; others fearful of defeat - and pick from two responses to get them refocused. It's utterly pointless, though, as, during the speeches, keywords will appear in the air behind them to really hammer it home, so all you have to do is match the words to the statement. It adds nothing to the game other than a chance to reset the cooldown on the Guardians' special moves and allow you to kick butt to Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go or some other delightful 80s tune. It was sadly buggy, too. Playing the PS5 version, I encountered numerous issues, including a good dozen crashes, progress and audio glitches, broken button-prompts and HUD instructions - I once had ""Chapter 3 - The Cost of Freedom"" emblazoned across the top of my screen for 20 minutes, and a triangle prompt that wouldn't go away until a soft reset - and it took six attempts and an overnight reprieve to conquer the Dweller of Darkness boss fight because each time I cut off its third appendage, the game would crash.Bugs aside, there's a lot here that Eidos can be proud of, but those things are hard to find amongst an oversaturation of gameplay systems and mechanics, and uninspired combat. As much as I enjoyed the game's stunning set-pieces and thoughtful storyline - not to mention the prerequisite post-credits (and post-post-credits) scenes - unlocking the full complement of your pals' sparring skillsets and getting to the end of Guardians of the Galaxy feels like an unmitigated slog when you're fighting an endless sea of tanky, bullet-spongey Centurions. And I still can't quite understand why a game that relies so heavily on cooperative play offers no co-op option at all.

Release date: October 26
Link: Official siteI did not expect to root for Guardians of the Galaxy this much. It was weighed down by so many stagnant vibes during its pre-release cycle. The shadow of Marvel's Avengers, Square Enix's 2020 attempt to transmute the total media superiority of the Marvel Cinematic Universe into a living co-op videogame, loomed particularly large. That game's cast of Hollywood facsimiles—all of these fake Chris Hemsworths—left customers ice cold, and while the core narrative was decent, nobody enjoyed the meaningless currency grind.Guardians comes from the same publisher and appears to be made of the same stock, except that this time, it's a singleplayer-only campaign and the player is restricted to the least interesting member of the troupe, Star-Lord. There is a pervasive focus-tested coldness that corrodes so many products that bear the Marvel name in 2021, and I wasn't optimistic that Eidos Montreal would be capable of overcoming the taint.That is until I solved a puzzle involving a psychedelic space llama who I needed to coax into chewing up some wires on the ship. The beast was either enchanted or repelled by each crewmember's singing voice—he'd come closer to Star-Lord's melody, run away from Rocket Raccoon's, and so on—so we all took turns belting out Bobby McFerrin's ""Don't Worry Be Happy"" until our mercurial llama was finally in place. Guardians is full of sequences that capture the odder, funnier, lighter side of Marvel's cosmic expanse. I ran into a Soviet test-flight golden retriever blessed with celestial hyper-intelligence, and in a moment of weakness, he admitted to me how much he missed his former puny dog-intellect, those endless afternoons chasing tennis balls in the front lawn. There's a fourth-wall-breaking left-hook, taken right out of the Arkham playbook, tying to an amazing twist that caught me hilariously off-guard. Hell, deep into the game's final acts, I watched as the permanently chaffed Rocket Raccoon faced his one lingering trauma thanks to the encouragement and support of his teammates. The scene worked as a better emotional payoff than anything I've seen the character do on film. Guardians of the Galaxy has its heart in the right place… if only the game itself weren't constantly sabotaging those efforts with exhausting technical jank.Like Avengers before it, Guardians of the Galaxy is steeped deep in the character-action tradition. You take control of Star-Lord, as I mentioned earlier, and unload an endless stream of photon beams at all the toothy beasties, corrupt interplanetary cops, and deranged cult leaders that stand in your way. A bar on the left side of the screen fills up as the player deals damage, punctuated with Marvel-fied versions of those vintage Devil May Cry descriptors—""Marvelous!"" ""Uncanny!"" The remaining Guardians come into play with your unlockable special power rolodex. I could ask Groot to bind my enemies to the floor with his roots, or summon up Drax for an earth-shattering ground pound. But outside of those instances, your fellow superheroes are relegated to the nameless faces that tend to populate Call of Duty levels, offering the faint image of warfighting solidarity, without actually doing anything all that productive.It gets the job done. The combat isn't where Guardians of the Galaxy shines, but it is both flashy enough and simple enough to sustain some of the more active portions of the plot. I found that the villain-fighting got more engaging the closer I came to the game's conclusion. In the beginning, armed with only a pair of pea-shooters and a handful of basic attacks, Guardians is a shooting gallery with no pulse. But when you're popping off multiple cooldowns at once and enjoying a fully optimized arsenal, the design gets close to that overwhelming, splash-panel, polychromatic eye candy that is so often prioritized in the films. Lasers, bombs, swords, and Drax flying in off the top rope like a punishing Marvel vs Capcom assist. One of the best features in Guardians of the Galaxy is its ""Huddle Up"" function. Every once in a while you can call the team together, offer some words of encouragement, and re-enter the fray with a damage buff cued to a pulpy '80s classic pulled from the game's trove of licensed material. (I heard Gary Numan's ""Cars,"" Wham's ""Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go,"" Soft Cell's ""Tainted Love."") It is genuinely incandescent.The story here is centered around the usual universe-threatening Marvel disaster. There's some sort of hyper-religious stellar church corrupting the minds of the Andromeda Galaxy. Our motley crew is here to stop it, even as the odds continue to pile up against us. The Guardians might be a roving batch of greedy malcontents, but at least they've got a heart of gold. The broad-strokes didn't interest me much, but Guardians does a good job integrating the uber-high stakes into the cloistered anxieties of the heroes themselves. One of the cult's first victims? A girl who may or may not be Star-Lord's illegitimate child. How could a bunch of daffy venerated nerds ever seduce a chiseled meathead like Drax? Maybe by introducing the memories of his dead wife and daughter. All of this is buttressed by Guardians' moral choice infrastructure, which is clearly ripped directly from the Telltale convention. Along the way, Star-Lord has a hand in shaping the team's plans and posture, which have a light impact on the narrative. In the interstitial periods between missions, you can chop it up with the team on the ship, akin to those elliptical therapy sessions hosted by Commander Shepard on the Normandy. The writers here are clearly bound by Marvel orthodoxy, but it was still cool to see some of their own flourishes. (Gamora, for instance, is a huge action figure collector in this timeline.)I should reiterate again that Guardians of the Galaxy is very much singleplayer and plot-focused. You move from chapter to chapter, disembarking on all sorts of famous Marvel locales, fighting through beautiful corridors that are occasionally broken up by some heavy-duty cutscenes. That makes the game a bit of a dinosaur, in a good way. A number of the attack unlocks are tied to certain wrinkles in the dramatic arc rather than meeting a certain threshold of resources. You will spend precisely zero minutes staring at talent trees or defensive integers. When I saw that the characters all had their own suite of greyed-out costumes, I thought for sure they were going to be cinched by some sort of depressing meta-grind and an in-game real money store. Nope, you just find those stashed away in the remote corners of the geography as a reward for taking the time to explore. It brings to mind the storytelling conventions of the Uncharted and God of War series. Eidos doesn't punch at quite that weight, but it does enough here to be mentioned alongside those influences.This level of jank is expected in the high-entropy continent of Tamriel, not in a series of combat arenas and connective tissue.That brings me to the core, debilitating issue with Guardians. This game is frequently, flagrantly broken. At one point I ran into three different crashes within a single hour of play. One was a bizarre soft-lock, the other two were straight-up hardcore freezes that required an alt-F4 to escape. The first boss I fought stopped moving a few times; it was stuck in stasis as I blasted away at its tentacles, scoring oodles of cheap damage. The game routinely believed Star-Lord had fallen down a phantom pit, and it dutifully teleported me back to some sort of crucible of danger completely haphazardly. I needed to reload checkpoints in order to get certain progression choke-points to trigger.It's bad, and Square Enix knows it. When I first downloaded my review code for Guardians, it came in at a ridiculous 150GB size. A few days later, the company issued a new version that reduced the file size and promised greater stability. The crashes I described earlier all occurred after that big patch, though. Another patch came after and more will come, but the odds that every physics anomaly and crash will be swept up within days of launch are slim—the post-launch bug fixing phase can go for months and months with big games.This makes Guardians of the Galaxy a difficult game to recommend right now. Something clearly went awry during development, because it's weird for a singleplayer, linear game to have so many bizarre performance issues. This level of jank is expected in the high-entropy continent of Tamriel, not in a series of combat arenas and connective tissue. The closest analogue I can think of is Jedi Fallen Order; another Disney property that shipped with a well-hewn narrative, some neat combat tricks, and a boatload of sundering technical hangups. Unfortunately, I don't think Guardians is quite good enough to offset those problems the way Respawn did.But then I think back to a sequence early on, where Star-Lord runs into an old drinking buddy named Lipless at a slimy dive bar in Knowhere. The two of you fumble through a turgid hair-metal anthem that, apparently, the hero was too blacked-out to remember writing. The player chooses each line in the song, and Star-Lord does his best to half-mumble the lyrics to stay on Lipless' good side. Guardians of the Galaxy desperately wants to be a technicolor, starfaring adventure worthy of the multimedia powerhouse that shares its namesake. It accomplishes that with its story, its voice cast, and its wonderfully cheeky '80s pastiche. If only the technical side could better keep up with those ambitions.A surprisingly good time when you're not forced to reload your checkpoint after a game-breaking bug.Luke Winkie is a freelance journalist and contributor to many publications, including PC Gamer, The New York Times, Gawker, Slate, and Mel Magazine.

Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy game might be better than the movies. It's incredibly rare for a game to make me laugh as much as it does cry, but what Eidos Montreal has created here is something rather magical, both in terms of its story and its execution. Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is a game where you embody everything it is to be a leader, including all the doubts and insecurities that come with it. You play as Star-Lord, the leader of a Guardians of the Galaxy team who have only been working together for a year or so. What that means is that they're still learning to operate as a team and as an adopted family. It puts you in a great position as a player, allowing you to learn more about each of these characters as Star-Lord himself does. Release date: October 26, 2021

Developer: Eidos Montreal
Publisher: Square EnixIf you're familiar with the comics or the MCU movies, these Guardians feel like an episode of What If. They're familiar characters, with recognizable traits and personalities, but with different backstories featuring characters and events that'll make you build a separate timeline for these alt-history versions. Discovering how they differ from what you'd expect is just part of the charm. What I particularly love about Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is that you learn about their strengths and weaknesses as characters both in narrative and combat sections. Narratively, the longer you spend with the game, poking in every corner and following every dialogue prompt, the more the game gives back. Finding collectibles unlocks further dialogue options back on the Milano, while taking time to have a quick chat with a character mid-mission or simply just listening in conversations all help build a better picture of who these Guardians are, and it's so rewarding to find. You're not going to lose out by blasting through the game's quest, but if you love these characters as much as I do after the opening few missions, you're going to want to peel back every layer of this onion. There's an extra incentive in finding all the dialogue here, because the writing is excellent. It's brilliantly funny, making my laughter blurt out in many moments from excellently timed, didn't realize that joke was coming joy. But it's also touching, sweet, and occasionally downright emotional, with two particular moments almost drawing real tears. You end up really caring for these characters, with Drax, in particular, being a standout favorite for just how well-rounded his character is. Yes, he's still deadpan / accidentally funny, but he's also hurting from the guilt of surviving an intergalactic war. They all are, in their own way, and it really makes this story one that you'll highly invest in. As their leader, you'll have to be additionally invested because they're all going to look to you to make decisions. While there is one overall ending to discover, there are decisions that'll have to make along the way that can have an impact on how things play out. I won't spoil any of them here, but even seemingly innocuous dialogue options can lead to something happening that may help or hinder you later on. This is the team that brought us the most recent Deus Ex games after all, so they have priors when it comes to branching dialogue systems like this. However, I will say that it's not always clear when something you've done will have an effect later, or whether you really had a choice at all in certain moments, even though the game may suggest you did. Leadership will always have an effect in combat. Each of the Guardians has a unique set of skills that you can call upon in battle, commanding them almost RTS-style to use a specific ability on a certain enemy. There's a great strategy element in figuring out how to take down the more powerful enemies, or when to unleash certain moves when you're feeling overrun. For example, using Drax to diminish a stagger bar, before sending in Gamora to deal high-level damage. Or using Groot to wrap his roots around a group of enemies before using Rocket's bombs on them en masse. It's essential too, as not using the team's abilities can see you flatlining all too regularly, especially if you don't combo this up with Star-Lord's own abilities, including his elemental blasters. This all plays out in combat that always feels like you're fully in control. Strategizing and reacting is great fun, and there are boss battles where you'll need to think carefully about what to do when. There are some moments where I would have appreciated a touch more variety in the enemy types and the ways to use the skills, but it's mostly a great experience.You can use these specific skills to solve puzzles in the world outside of battle too. Drax, for example, can lift and move hefty objects, while Gamora can leap up to high places to give you a boost. Rocket can hack terminals and Groot can lift platforms. But, there's definitely an element of the puzzles being pretty repetitive. There's an electricity puzzle where you interact with terminals to redirect the flow that's introduced pretty early on and then very overused. I'm unconvinced that multiple planets use the same electricity systems, and eventually you can become weary of following yellow lines around. Otherwise, puzzles are mostly traversal-based, and almost platformer-esque in places. Again, some of the elements - like using Star-Lord's scanner on the terrain to find something Gamora can slash through with her sword - become a little tired by the time you're in the closing chapters, but there are some great little set-pieces to discover, which are further complemented by the way the Guardians react to them. The game could just have benefitted from a few more elements or mechanics to keep things fresh. But the repetitious elements are greatly overshadowed by the fact the story is just so damn enjoyable. The landscapes you explore are wonderfully put together and utterly screenshot worthy, and there's always the encouragement to take a moment to explore - especially in the jovial quips from the Guardians that you're wandering off… again. Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy excels in its storytelling, delivering a narrative that will linger with you long after the credits roll - so much so I am eager to go back in and make different decisions. There's great fun to be had in its combat and puzzle solving, but it's held back a little by a lack of range in its puzzles and mechanics, particularly later on. Reviewed on PS5 with a code provided by the publisher.Sam Loveridge is the Global Editor-in-Chief of GamesRadar, and joined the team in August 2017.

Metro GameCentral,"The latest big budget Marvel game is a vast improvement on the Avengers tie-in and one of the best action adventures of the year.You can just imagine the dollars signs that must have shone in the eyes of Square Enix execs, as they signed up the video game licence for The Avengers – especially once Endgame went on to become the biggest movie of all-time. Except, while official licences might buy you success with sports sims it’s not the guarantee you’d imagine with movies and other media. Games like Spider-Man and Batman: Arkham have done very well but only because they were good games, while Marvel’s Avengers has fared unexpectedly poorly because it’s not.The best parts of the Avengers game were the story elements surrounding Ms. Marvel, which made you wish that Square Enix had just made a normal single-player game, instead of trying to merge it with a confused mess of co-op and live service features. You’d assume, because it also revolves around a team of characters with very different powers, that Guardians Of The Galaxy would take the same tact but it does not. It’s a purely single-player action adventure where you only ever get to control Star-Lord. It’s also much, much better than that sounds.Apart from both featuring a mixture of ranged and melee combat, with multiple allied characters running around, there really aren’t any similarities with the Avengers game at all. Guardians Of The Galaxy isn’t an action role-player (there’s a small number of extra abilities to unlock but that’s it) but if you think of it as a cross between Mass Effect and Streets Of Rage you wouldn’t be far off.As with the other Marvel video games this isn’t set in the cinematic universe, even though much of the character and hardware designs are very similar. The Guardians films are one of the least authentic to the comics though and the game picks and chooses between them, so while Drax and Rocket Racoon are clearly based more on their film versions, Star-Lord has a backstory much closer to the comics and Mantis has almost nothing in common with her movie incarnation.The game probably would’ve been better off basing everything on the comics though as while the storytelling is surprisingly complex, and tackles some serious issues, the characterisation inevitably suffers by comparisons with the films. The game goes overboard in having Drax constantly taking metaphors literally, to the point where he seems to do it in almost every second line of dialogue. And apart from one fun personality quirk, that’s not in the movies, Gamora is a little bland, as she never interacts with Thanos or Nebula and there’s no hint of any romance with Star-Lord.Far worse though is Rocket, who is one of the most irritating video game characters we’ve ever had to endure. The films always walk a tightrope in terms of not having him seem too obnoxious or argumentative, but the game makes him absolutely insufferable from the first moment, as he manages to complain and whine his way through almost the entire game – while demonstrating himself to be a thoroughly amoral person/raccoon.That sounds like a real problem but oddly it’s not, even though one of the other irritations is that none of the characters ever shuts up, as they constantly talk over each other like they’re in a Robert Altman film. They’re never really that funny either, with the game’s script being just that touch more straightlaced than the movies (despite being filled with faux swear words like ‘scut’ and ‘flark’) and unable to generate the same style of irrelevant, unpredictable humour.As damning as that should be though, it’s strangely not an issue, in part because all of the characters, including Rocket, get a proper self-contained story arc, and partly because the rest of the game is so unexpectedly entertaining.Guardians’ combat system has two main components, as you take direct control of Star-Lord while he engages in some surprisingly meaty melee combat and uses his ‘element gun’ (which is a thing from the more recent comics) that gradually unlocks the ability to shoot ice, electricity, and other powers – that are often also used for environmental puzzles. Star-Lord has his own buffs, that are unlocked with collected resources, while all five main characters have three unique special moves that are gained by spending skill points – and a fourth at predetermined story moments.You can’t play as any of the other characters, but you can order them around – not in terms of where they go but who they attack and when. This allows you to manage crowd control and activate special moves, many of which can be combo-ed into each other, such as Groot holding an enemy down, Drax staggering it, and Gamora performing an area of attack move. It’s not the deepest tactical system ever devised, and the lock-on is fiddlier than it should be, but the overall experience is a lot of fun, with a decent amount of enemy variety.The game is entirely linear and there are no side quests on the first playthrough, just small diversions to find resources, alternative costumes, and unique items that reveal a bit of background lore about one of the characters. Apart from Star-Lord’s weird, inhuman eyebrows the graphics are generally very good but what really impresses is the art design, which again excels when it’s showing things not in the films.This is the only big budget game in a long time that has proper alien landscapes and creatures, with weird colours and strange plant life that for once looks like something other than just a rock quarry or a desert/forest/snow planet. There is a snow world but it’s constantly being bombarded with perfectly oblong meteorites, while the aliens range from cyclopean beach balls to peculiar tentacle monsters that attack in packs, and poisonous bipeds that look like something out of The Thing.Some of these may be based on existing Marvel comic book designs but it’s a real pleasure to see developer Eidos-Montréal constantly trying to present you with something you haven’t seen before. This is true of both the visuals and unexpected gameplay segues, such as a couple of space combat sequences and what at first seems to be a series of bog-standard arena battles but which are resolved in a surprising way by listening to what the characters are saying and not thinking of the game purely as a mindless action title.We should emphasise that despite the issue with the script the storytelling is actually very good. The game is filled with binary decisions you have to make, some of which come quickly, one after the other, as you try to talk your way out of a situation or convince a potential ally to help you. In some instances, success has an immediate benefit but in others you get a little ‘character X will remember that’ style onscreen note that may not pay off until right near the end of the game.There are also a number of lengthy sequences that are purely dialogue based and it becomes clear that the main theme of the game is coping with loss and learning to let go, which despite all the sci-fi silliness (the plot revolves around a religious cult harnessing faith as an energy source) is handled with surprising tact and insight.This requires Star-Lord to be far less pathetic, and much more responsible, than he is in the films, which may disappoint some, but it works in context and some of the side characters, like Cosmo the space dog and the gloriously over-the-top Lady Hellbender, are great value. The game is also surprisingly (that word again) well anchored to the wider Marvel universe and, in one particular Easter egg, the Marvel Cinematic Universe.The game is filled with unexpected references though, not just from the disturbingly vast Disney empire but including everything from Pac-Man (which Square Enix must’ve gone to the bother of licensing from Bandai Namco) to Deathtrap Dungeon.The 80s soundtrack is amazing too, featuring everyone from Blondie and Def Leppard to Soft Cell and Rick Astley. Its embarrassment of riches isn’t utilised very well though, as most of the time a song just plays at random when you activate what is essentially rage mode during combat. Only once – with Final Countdown right at the end – is it used for any real dramatic or ironic effect.Alan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNew Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart bundle is £50 off reveals leakXbox will be less hands-off with Bethesda amid major reorganisationGuardians Of The Galaxy is an easy game to pick holes in and as we read back over these faults it seems surprising even to us that we enjoyed it so much. Evidently, it’s more than the sum of its parts but there is something intrinsically entertaining about a big budget video game made to this level of competence, in terms of gameplay, storytelling, and presentation. Despite being such an expensive game, that’s using an equally expensive licence, it’s impressively daring, in a way that means you never quite know what’s coming next.Perhaps that says more about the predictability and tiredness of other AAA games but short of getting James Gunn to write the script it’s hard to imagine how this could have turned out better. It’s an ambitious, well-made third person action game that, crucially, would work just as well without the licence. And, just as crucially, it’s absolutely nothing like the Avengers game.In Short: A surprisingly ambitious cosmic space adventure that excels the more it diverges from the movies, offering robust action, impressive visuals, and unexpectedly sophisticated storytelling.Pros: A highly competent mix of interactive storytelling and robust, tactical combat that consistently manages to surprise and entertain. Excellent art design and graphics. Amazing 80s soundtrack.Cons: Rocket is an insufferable ass for the majority of the game and Drax and Gamora aren’t as funny as they are in the films. Lock-on system lacks precision.Score: 8/10Formats: PlayStation 5 (reviewed), Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch*, Xbox Series X/S, and PCPrice: £59.99Publisher: Square EnixDeveloper: Eidos-MontréalRelease Date: 26th October 2021Age Rating: 16*cloud streaming onlyEmail gamecentral@metro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter

Game Informer,"From the moment the Guardians of the Galaxy are introduced as a space-faring team that will do anything for a quick buck, it’s abundantly clear how much of a dysfunctional mess they are. Gamora and Rocket are at each other’s throats. Drax and Star-Lord don’t see eye to eye. And no one is paying attention to Groot. For the next 15-plus hours of gameplay, I listened to these misfits bicker, hurl insults, and chatter nonstop – much to my enjoyment.When I say “nonstop,” I mean they never stop talking. A second rarely goes by without the Guardians sharing their thoughts. I’m not exaggerating this frequency. Any moments of quiet made me question if the game was not working properly. The amount of dialogue that Eidos-Montreal crafted is off the charts, and most of it is nicely penned, offering the witty humor, heartfelt intimacy, and sheer chaos you’d expect from the Guardians.Drax’s inability to comprehend common colloquialisms and phrases brings big laughs and is just as good as James Gunn’s take on the character in the Guardians’ movies. I’ve never said this in a review before, but the dialogue is the best part of the game. Eidos-Montreal knocked it out of the park. The rest of the game delivers plenty of fun but with varying levels of quality and polish – the latter subtly hurting critical areas of the experience.It took me a few hours to warm up to both Star-Lord and the combat system. Peter Quill is a bit grating from the outset but comes around when the team dynamic begins to gel, and the story softens from its overall bombastic tone to allow him to show his emotional side. I ended up adoring him over time, especially when he’s talking to himself.His story is well written, and Eidos-Montreal did an excellent job injecting his leadership qualities into the action and decision-making. Players are in total control of Star-Lord and will determine the road your team takes. These choices aren’t on the same seismic scale as a Mass Effect game and don’t change the story much, but do offer fun alternate sequences and even more dialogue.I can’t speak to all of the outcomes that stem from these choices, but the dozen-plus I experienced in a second playthrough were just as good and flowed as naturally as those in my first run through the game. While it was to fun to take in the different humor or unique gameplay sequences I missed before, they weren’t enough for me to want to keep going to see how the second journey would be different. Again, things aren't changing much.This is a game where the narrative consumes just as much time as gameplay. Given how enjoyable the story is, I didn’t have a problem sitting back and watching for a big chunk of my time, especially when I had control over the most significant decisions. The allure of discovery anchors the story and touches each Guardian in ways that flesh them out thoroughly. I don’t want to give away too much of the plot, but the Guardians are chasing something evil that they unleash. That hook remains strong through most of the experience, moving at a nice clip and striking a delicate balance between serious and outright absurd.Eidos-Montreal fully embraces “science-fiction” themes in the worlds, characters, and that evil entity of note. The worlds steal the eye with their wildly colored and oddly designed vistas. The characters are just as weird (sometimes for comedic sake), and that evil beast moves in the most peculiar and astonishing ways.Each world pushes the Guardians to lean into their unique abilities to navigate treacherous terrain. The paths forward are always linear and filled with platforming sequences and combat arenas, much like the Uncharted games. While the player only controls Star-Lord – a decision that works well for all gameplay aspects – each Guardian can be summoned with a button press to perform a specific task. These brief inputs work well, and Eidos-Montreal even warps the character to the desired location to make sure you are moving forward at a solid pace. You can summon Drax to knock over a pillar or Gamora to leap up onto a wall to give you a boost up to a platform. All the Guardians’ moves are used for environmental puzzle solving, which starts fun but loses its luster through repeated solutions.The Guardians also play massive roles in combat and are as powerful as you would hope. Groot can upend enemies with a swarm of roots, Rocket blasts foes with a silly number of guns, and Drax and Gamora use blades to slice and dice. For Star-Lord, however, this is not a game I’d bill as a power fantasy. His blasters are weak, and he must work hard to drop even the lowliest of foes. All the Guardians need to be used in strategic ways to find success. Star-Lord can dash around quickly and tick away at the enemy’s health, but his most significant contribution is as a play-maker. When he wants to call upon a Guardian, time slows, and he can tell them to perform a desired ability. It’s not a power fantasy, but a teamwork fantasy that ends up being immensely satisfying when everything is clicking as it should.At its peak, combat is handled admirably through the controls, allowing the player to whip across the arena, quickly highlight targets, and just as swiftly tell each Guardian what to do. Given how many characters are onscreen at any given time, the fray looks chaotic, but there’s a violent beauty to it, and you oversee all of it, barking out commands to rain death in various ways. The Guardians can also chain together most moves to truly show the team's power. By the end of the game, the battles are wildly entertaining and deliver a good challenge. Oddly, the game’s most powerful ability is a pep talk by Star-Lord, which always carries a little humor, but pauses combat for far too long and ends up being quite annoying.Now the bad news: The opening hours of combat are a rough and uneventful ride. Before legitimate threats come out of the woodwork, the Guardians take on gelatinous cubes and spheres, conflicts that are as dull as they sound. With a good majority of abilities locked away for over half of the game, the true potential of the Guardians is kept at bay for far too long, and the experience suffers. This game is at its best when it’s over the top, and it eventually gets there, but not quickly enough. The training wheels are on for half of the game. A lack of polish across the entire experience also hurts. Some animations are a bit jumpy, specific gameplay mechanics like sliding don’t offer much precision, and combat’s framerate can be rough at times.Another misfire is controlling the Milano in space-combat sequences. It’s cool in concept, but awkward controls and lack of a threat make these moments little more than a visual showcase. The game’s other distractions fare much better. Tracking down different suits for each Guardian is a nice reward, and some collectibles that appear on the Milano open new conversations and backstory.As a fan of the Guardians’ comic books and movies, I thoroughly enjoyed Eidos-Montreal’s unique take on this supergroup. The nonstop character banter and nicely designed choices make this a journey worth taking, even if the gameplay takes a little too long to highlight the team’s true potential.

Polygon,"Filed under:They may be a ragtag band of misfits, but they’re *my* ragtag band of misfitsI went into Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy expecting a few chuckles, but the tears surprised me. I’m an emotional guy, and I’m secure in the fact that I’ve cried during multiple video games and Marvel movies. But there’s an exploration of loss in Eidos Montreal’s newest outing that genuinely caught me off guard. Then again: Nothing about Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is quite what I expected. Polygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences. When we award the Polygon Recommends badge, it’s because we believe the recipient is uniquely thought-provoking, entertaining, inventive, or fun — and worth fitting into your schedule. If you want curated lists of our favorite media, check out What to Play and What to Watch.Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is a third-person action game where you play as Peter Quill, AKA Star-Lord, the ’80s-obsessed captain of the titular mercenaries-turned-heroes. The game takes you and your squad to a variety of planets where you’ll need to blast enemies with your dual guns and command the rest of the Guardians to perform special moves in combat. The game’s quieter moments have you exploring the weirdest parts of Marvel’s galaxy, selecting dialogue options and using your allies to break down walls or create bridges out of branches. But, at its best, the bridges and walls in Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy are, in a sense, purely metaphorical, and your relationship with your crewmates is paramount. Most of the 16 chapters feature the Guardians making their way through a new planet, ship, or space station, shooting the shit, launching into cutscenes, and solving environmental puzzles with Drax’s strength or Rocket’s hacking skills. While bumbling around, I can hit one of the shoulder buttons during key moments to select a dialogue option, steering conversations in one direction or another. Sometimes the game pops up with a typical “Rocket will remember this” prompt, and sometimes my input just adds a bit of flavor.Combat occasionally interrupts the exploration, and as Star Lord, it’s my job to not only fight but to command the rest of the team as well. Groot is great at binding enemies with his roots, while Gamora excels at dealing heavy damage to individual enemies. Guardians nails such a strong sense of camaraderie that when one member is absent from combat, I feel the loss.However, Eidos Montreal understands its source material and knows that arguments and internal drama are essential to the Guardians’ dynamics. About halfway through my adventure, everyone on the team was feeling a bit disenfranchised. Rocket and Star-Lord were in the middle of an argument. Gamora was depressed for unknown reasons. Drax had uncharacteristically given up. And Groot … was Groot. I stepped out into a space station, and within minutes, we had all gone our separate ways. For the first time, I was apart from my teammates, and it’s to this game’s credit that I actually felt lonely.I eventually stumbled upon Drax staring into a great cosmic void. Dialogue options appeared and we began to chat. Canonically, these characters’ pasts aren’t exactly the same as the James Gunn Marvel movies, but there is at least one constant: Peter Quill and Drax the Destroyer have both lost their families to tragedy. As Peter, I explained the human concept of heaven to Drax, and he explained the beliefs of his own people. Drax ended the conversation by asking for some alone time, but as I walked away, he stopped me to say, “Peter Quill, I hope your mother found her way to ‘heaven.’” On its own, the line might seem trite, but at the tail end of an uncharacteristically emotional conversation with an otherwise stoic brute, it was affecting.Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy had some major visual and gameplay issues in the build I reviewed on PlayStation 5. I ran into texture popping, black boxes, shaking models, incomplete animations, and other distracting problems. In certain gameplay sections, prompts were unusable and in one instance a critical cutscene didn’t play after a climactic battle (closing the game and replaying the fight solved the issue). Eidos Montreal promises that many of the game’s issues will be solved in a day-one patch that was unavailable to us at the time of review.The Guardians all have strong personalities, so watching them come together is a major highlight in an already excellent game. At one point, I denied Drax when he suggested we simply toss Rocket across a chasm to then let us across, and we all took the long way around instead. Through hours of their ambient chit-chat, I watched the pair build a friendly relationship with one another that I helped foster. When Rocket himself eventually asked Drax to chuck him for the good of the team — much like Gimli in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers — Drax denied the request, saying Rocket was a valuable teammate, not a tool. We found another way around at Drax’s behest. I’m unsure if that moment would’ve happened if I hadn’t said no to Drax’s initial throw, but I’m not sure I care. What matters to me is that I watched their relationship build from animosity to trust and respect — eventually, Drax saw the same potential in Rocket that I did.One of my favorite moments in Guardians of the Galaxy didn’t occur until I was nearing the end. After spending the entire game telling Groot to make bridges for the team, Groot walked up to a gap and placed a bridge without me asking. At first I thought it was a bug, but Peter complimented Groot on his initiative. Similarly, Rocket began hacking electronics of his own accord. I treated my teammates with respect from the beginning, and they were paying it back to me in the gameplay itself.Guardians of the Galaxy is full of genuine moments like these. The Guardians never stop sniping at each other — it’s their nature — but it’s the difference between intentionally hurting a rival kid’s feelings and ribbing a sibling. True to life, the Guardians don’t change on a dime when you say the magic words — their evolution is gradual and, occasionally, painful.Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is about the difficulties that come with friendship and found family, but also how necessary connection is for all of us. The game shows how frustrating characters like Rocket Raccoon can be. But in his absence, I found myself exploring less and pushing through the story just to find my way back to him, even if he was still mad at me — anything not to be alone anymore. It takes work to love someone, or a group of someones, and it’s that shared labor that Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy taps into.Life can be isolating, and I’ve turned to many video games to make friends and help me keep in touch with real-life loved ones around the country or — over the past year — just around the corner. Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy won’t fool you into thinking you’re having those same, genuine social interactions with people you care about. But to Eidos Montreal’s great credit, the Guardians give a convincing performance. I always expected to jet around blasting aliens in Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy. But its new place as one of the more emotionally resonant video game stories in recent memory easily makes it 2021’s best surprise. Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy will be released Oct. 26 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. A “Cloud Version” will also come to Nintendo Switch on release day.

GameSpot,"Eidos-Montréal's Guardians of the Galaxy digs into the weird side of Marvel comics to deliver a fulfilling story about the titular heroes.By 
    Jordan Ramée
   on October 25, 2021 at 6:00AM PDTI'm a big fan of the ""found family"" trope. There's something so heartwarming about watching complete strangers finding a place to belong by sticking with each other. It's the basic underlying principle of practically every superhero or vigilante team, including the Guardians of the Galaxy. Developer Eidos-Montréal's Guardians of the Galaxy builds off this premise to deliver an incredible story about what comes after the found family trope. In the game, the family has been found, its forging hinted at in conversations throughout the game's campaign. But as anyone who is a part of a family (found or otherwise) can tell you, forming connections with people isn't the hard part; it's the regular struggle to maintain those bonds that really takes effort. And that's at the heart of Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, a game that says that a family, once found, is worth fighting for.Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy picks up following the creation of the titular team, all of whom have some sort of history with one another. It plays out a lot like developer Insomniac Games' Marvel's Spider-Man in that way--the origin story has already occurred, and the player is now catching up on what the characters already know. Though I can see how this setup could confuse players who aren't familiar with Peter Quill, Gamora, Rocket, Groot, and Drax (if you don't know their backstories, you might be confused as to why Drax distrusts Gamora when he is the one who killed her father, for example), this setup ultimately works to the game's benefit. Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy regularly moves beyond familiarity, digging into the wonderfully bizarre cosmic side of Marvel's universe, all of which is so absurdly alien.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy Video ReviewAnd yet, it's all very human too, and that's why it works so well. These might not be the Guardians you're familiar with--heck, you might not be familiar with the team at all--but the issues that they're attempting to deal with and overcome are all deeply relatable. The same can be said for the increasingly strange assortment of allies and enemies the Guardians meet. You latch onto their issues and pay attention to them because they're the parts of the story that make the most sense from a human perspective. That, more than anything, captures the sensation of being Peter Quill, aka Star Lord, a human who finds himself regularly exploring a galaxy far removed from the goings-on of Earth, and yet, as an Earthling, is ideally suited for navigating these galactic issues because he can bring out the innate humanity of these aliens.You apply Peter's human perspective via your own with choice-driven dialogue. You'll regularly be presented with opportunities where Peter can respond to conversations in multiple ways. Similarly to games like Oxenfree or Afterparty, your available choices pop up for a limited time and those around you usually don't stop talking while Peter is thinking, presenting the opportunity to say nothing at all. Sometimes, though, missing a chance to speak is a risk worth taking, as holding out to respond can occasionally allow you to gather more information about how everyone is feeling by listening to the conversation.The act of listening to someone as opposed to just hearing the words is a big part of the game's narrative core. The overarching campaign of Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy isn't affected by the choices you make, but individual relationships and certain story developments are influenced, and the best outcomes only occur if you listen to what people are saying and reply in a way that responds to their concerns. Oftentimes, that results in immediate consequences, but there are a handful of opportunities where your choices early on can have long-standing effects, and it's deeply gratifying to see the game reward you in later conflicts for being a good listener throughout the course of the campaign.That campaign sees the Guardians struggling to pay off a massive debt in order to avoid being arrested, a task that ultimately gets the five self-described heroes for hire tangled up in a galaxy-wide threat. This game isn't reinventing the traditional superhero story, and you'll likely foresee several of its twists and turns. But it's well-written and well-sold by the fairly impressive motion capture and superb voice talent that bring life to an otherwise by-the-books story. Notably, Romane Denis, who voices 12-year-old Nikki Gold, brings an earnest warmth and child-like mischief to her performance. It's easy to see why Peter immediately takes a liking to Nikki when Denis does such a good job of ensuring that you, the player, also like her. The Guardians may be the focus of the campaign, but Nikki is at the heart of the game's story, providing a strong emotional throughline for the narrative theme of open communication leading to acceptance and a stronger family.Between the bouts of story, there are a lot of baddies to shoot. From murderous jello to familiar (and more often, unfamiliar if you haven't dug deep into the comics) super villains, the Guardians face a variety of threats throughout the game. Each foe seemingly encourages you to approach the threat in different ways--a target carrying a shield suggests you need to find a means of flanking them, while a more nimble beast-like enemy may seemingly prove difficult to attack if you can't pin them down. I say ""seemingly"" because it's an illusionary variety, and one that is easily seen through after a few hours with the game.Early on, the game advertises each Guardian as uniquely qualified for responding to these specific threats. For example, Groot is a tank with abilities geared towards crowd control while Drax is an aggressive fighter who can utilize his strength to stagger opponents, opening them to normal attacks. Peter even unlocks an ability early on that allows him to take to the skies and more easily get a lay of the land, seemingly incentivizing you to take on a more strategic leader-based role. None of that is necessary, though. Despite their variety of strengths, every enemy can be damaged by all five Guardians, so you can just as easily spam the same attacks over and over to win a fight. Fights may take a bit longer if you play that way, but not by much, so there's nothing spurring you on to approach combat strategically.And so fights ultimately devolve into ever-longer grind-fests as the number of enemies grow more plentiful and their health bars extend ever longer. By the end of the story, my go-to plan for most fights was to use Rocket's implosion grenades to forcibly pull all enemies together, send out Drax to bulldoze the group in order to stagger them, then follow up with Gamora's sword or Groot's branches to finish them off. Despite each Guardian unlocking four abilities, I never found myself having to use more than their first two to overcome a fight (save for Groot, who unlocks a clutch fourth skill near the end of the campaign).The game includes multiple difficulties, including a ""Custom"" level where you can adjust practically every aspect of combat, quick-time events, and dialogue choices to incredible detail (it's really quite something--this game has over a dozen approachability and accessibility settings). You could crank up the game's difficulty in order to create more of an incentive to use each Guardian to the best of your ability, at risk of a squad wipe for nearly every encounter, if you want an extra challenge. That said, doing so isn't intrinsically increasing the level of strategy needed to beat the game; it's simply making enemies into harder-hitting bullet sponges so fights become longer, not tougher.In the event a fight wasn't going my way, I could easily turn the tides with a team huddle, a mechanic I love but which feels underutilized. The huddle mechanic is like the Guardians' ""ultimate ability,"" charging throughout combat and best saved for when all seems dire or you want to lay on the damage and finish off a tough opponent. It sees Peter call his allies to him, allowing them to group up and express how they're feeling about the fight. You then get a choice of what to say to inspire the group, with the team being fully revived and their ability cooldowns reset if you respond to your allies' concerns. It's an interesting mechanic, insofar as it ties combat back to the narrative core of the game, providing a metaphor for how being a good listener is important for cultivating a strong family that supports each other. It's not so interesting a wrinkle that it washes away my problems with the rest of the unremarkable combat, though.When you're not telling your allies what to do or propping them up, you guide Peter, who controls like your traditional third-person, over-the-shoulder shooter protagonist. Peter can free aim or lock onto targets with his dual blasters, using his jet boots to dodge enemy attacks. There's not much to it--you're mostly just holding down the trigger and taking the time to dodge away from an attack or cool down your guns to keep them from overheating. But even when you do miss a dodge, you don't take much damage and even when your guns do overheat, you don't have to wait too long to start firing again--you don't have to think very hard, is the point I'm trying to get at. The game is designed with a focus on Peter giving his allies orders or support, which ultimately ensures that Peter himself isn't all that engaging to control in the heat of combat.Over the course of the campaign, you also unlock four different kinds of elemental ammo for Peter's blasters, allowing you to unleash special attacks that can take advantage of an enemy's weakness. Those aforementioned jello monsters, for instance? Normal attacks don't affect them that much, but if you use ice ammo to freeze them first, they'll become brittle and easy to destroy. Much like Gamora, Rocket, Drax, and Groot's abilities, however, the game doesn't adequately push you to engage with these special shots. I'd occasionally switch to wind ammo to pull in a far-away sniper or fire ammo to deal burning damage to a boss, but I mostly just left it on lightning ammo for the entire campaign and the game never dissuaded or penalized me for doing so. It's a mechanic that, once again, is asking the player to be strategic but then not providing any incentive to meaningfully engage with combat.This elemental ammo--alongside your allies' unique abilities--also play a role outside of combat. Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy features an assortment of environmental puzzles, a few of which hide optional collectibles and cosmetics, while most simply impede progress through a level. Save for one or two puzzles, however, none really encourage you to think about how to use the Guardians' skills in fulfilling ways. If you're stuck and the way forward is blocked by some pipes, you can command Gamora to cut through them. That puzzle never becomes more complex, though, so you'll just keep encountering pipes for her to cut through (okay, sometimes they're icicles or plant vines instead of pipes, but still). The same can be said for all of the different types of environmental roadblocks you have to overcome. You'll encounter pretty much every type of puzzle the game has within the first few hours and then just keep stumbling upon them again and again in slightly different flavors for the rest of the 16-hour campaign. At that point they're not roadblocks to overcome, they're just mildly annoying speedbumps where you know what to do before any of the characters can mention that the path forward is blocked.All paths eventually lead to the Milano, Peter's ship and the in-game hub you regularly return to between the planets that the Guardians visit. It's not much of a hub. Though it provides opportunities to have optional check-ins with individual members of your crew, these conversations are largely inconsequential and lack the emotional or narrative impact that occur throughout the rest of the game.Occasionally, your time in the ship also has you manning the helm. These sections aren't all that fun--they're either frustrating flying gauntlets where the Milano's finicky handling regularly leads to death-inducing crashes, or boring combat encounters where the simplistic mechanics and scenarios don't create engaging dogfights. Between the irrelevant optional crew conversations and unlikable space battles, the Milano ends up being the weakest part of the game.On the other end of the spectrum, the soundtrack is one of the strongest aspects of Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy. There are plenty of excellent licensed '80s tracks sprinkled throughout the Guardians' adventure to highlight badass story or combat moments, but the original score sells the game. The thematic undertones to each world help differentiate the various settings, while evolutions to the score accentuate shifts in narrative tone. The music used for an especially poignant emotional scene near the end of the campaign was just so excellent--it's soft, almost to the point that you can barely hear it, allowing the nearly indistinguishable tremor in the actors' voices to ring through, but it's noticeable enough to really sell the scene. It got my eyes to water at least, which is not a reaction I expected to have to a Guardians of the Galaxy game.Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy doesn't feature an engaging combat system, save for the moments where the team huddles provide a loose connection to the much more engaging narrative theme of the strength of communication. The game instead shines via its storytelling, which is enhanced by a talented collection of voice actors and a wonderful soundtrack. If this game is your introduction to the titular heroes, it's not the best first impression, but sometimes when the galaxy needs to be saved, you can settle for good enough.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"
Kotaku,"When Square Enix revealed Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy at E3 earlier this year, I was not excited. The idea of playing only as Peter “Star-Lord” Quill, arguably the least interesting member of the galaxy-guarding super group, did nothing for me. The poor technical performance displayed in the game’s early footage didn’t help. So I wrote it off, ignoring subsequent trailers and previews for a game that was clearly not for me. Now, after 15 hours of nonstop laughter, joy, and excitement, I’m writing it back on, which is totally something I can do.In Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy you play as Peter Quill, aka Star-Lord, a half-human, half-Spartoi space cowboy who stumbles into leading the titular rag-tag group of intergalactic heroes for hire. His crew includes beefy green powerhouse Drax the Destroyer, deadly assassin (and daughter of Thanos) Gamora, sentient tree creature Groot, and certainly-not-a-raccoon Rocket, the team’s munitions and technology expert.These are not the same Guardians of the Galaxy from the Marvel cinematic universe, nor is it the team from current comic book continuity. These Guardians are a unique creation of developer Eidos-Montréal. Though the game maintains the dysfunctional space family vibe of the Marvel films, Star-Lord and his companions are a little closer to their comic counterparts. For example, instead of being the son of Ego the Living Planet, here Peter Quill is the son of J’son, leader of the planet Spartax. Instead of dying from cancer, as in the movies, Peter’s mother is shot by assassins attempting to kill Peter and end J’son’s bloodline. Throughout the game we’re treated to little glimpses of Peter’s life on Earth, back when it was just him, his mother, and their majestic mullets.As Peter Quill knows, however, the real action is out in deep space. The game opens with the Guardians, barely a year after their formation, doing what they do best: space crimes. Strapped for cash, the team breaks into the Quarantine Zone, a site closed off after a vast interstellar war, in hopes of capturing a valuable monster they can sell to Lady Hellbender, the Monster Queen, for a quick buck. Things go wrong, and the Guardians find themselves arrested by the Nova Corps. Given the choice between paying a massive fine or going to prison, the team hatches a plot to sell one of their more monstrous members to Lady Hellbender to generate cash to pay the fine and get back to their regularly scheduled shenanigans.This leads to one of the game’s first big choices. Who will the team sell to Lady Hellbender, Groot or Rocket? Sure, Groot is a brilliant conversationalist and incredibly powerful, but Rocket packs a whole lot of angry asshole into an adorable little package. Ultimately, after much hemming and hawing, I decided to sell Rocket. Things go wrong, again, and now not only are the Guardians of the Galaxy in debt, they’re also being hunted across the galaxy by one very angry Monster Queen. While I doubt choosing Groot would have led to a vastly different outcome, having a choice is nice.If you’re thinking, “Well, that escalated quickly,” you ain’t seen nothing yet. The plot continues to escalate through the game’s 16 chapters, quickly evolving from “we need cash” to “oh god, the entire universe is going to end.” It wouldn’t be a Guardians of the Galaxy game without some galaxy guarding going on.Free from the shackles of comic movie continuity, Eidos-Montréal is able to tap in some of Marvel’s most powerful players, creating some truly spectacular story arcs that had me excitedly pointing at the screen in a desperate attempt to get my spouse interested in my nerdy comic book bullshit. “Look! It’s (redacted)!” I would shout, as they nodded patiently and listened to their true crime podcast.The story in Guardians of the Galaxy is strong. The humor is even stronger. The back-and-forth between members of the team as they explore alien planets and massive starships never fails to elicit at least a smile, if not a full-on guffaw. “Groot says the plants here are all either mean or stupid,” quips Rocket on a planet filled with exploding flora. We’ve got Drax taking everything literally, Rocket making fun of Quill’s dead mom, Gamora wondering how a newly-formed cadre of bad guys made their uniforms so quickly. Late in the game there’s an extended sequence featuring a character I am not allowed to mention that’s some of the most hilarious stuff I’ve ever heard in a video game.When Guardians of the Galaxy isn’t splitting my sides, it’s impressing the hell out of me as a fan of pulp science fiction. The aliens and planets depicted in the game remind me of the dusty old magazines I used to find at sci-fi conventions, their covers splashed with bizarre landscapes and creatures beyond my wildest imagination. Aside from the flashbacks to‘80s-era Earth, every setting in the game is fantastic.What an outstanding use of the video game medium to create something truly unique. There are no planets that look like “Earth, only a different color.” Nothing looks like it was filmed in a quarry or a desert with Instagram filters. Even spaceships, where designers could get away with generic metal plating and grates, are made up of unfamiliar, otherworldly elements.Playing as half-human smartass Peter Quill helps keep the experience grounded. In a team with superhuman warriors, a sentient tree, and a furry little science experiment, he’s a guy with a gun and jet boots. Sure, it’s a magical gun left by his alien father that’s capable of harnessing the power of different elements, but it’s a gun nonetheless.So, what’s it like being the half-human leader of a band of space misfits? It’s a lot like being Noctis, the leader of a group of hot boy adventurers in Square Enix’s Final Fantasy XV. As Peter explores alien worlds, Gamora, Groot, Drax, and Rocket are his Gladiolus, Ignis, and Prompto. They are his constant companions, providing a steady stream of commentary during their planet-spanning adventures. While wandering the surface of an alien world they might draw attention to points of interest. When encountering an obstacle they might give Peter a hint about how to, say, use the ice setting of his Element Gun to freeze water into a traversable platform.And in battle, Gamora, Groot, Drax, and Rocket become important weapons in Star-Lord’s arsenal. As Peter runs about, shooting his guns or throwing punches, you can pause the action and issue commands to your teammates. Each character has a series of four special abilities that unlock as you play the game, and these abilities often complement each other nicely, making the team really feel like a team. For instance, Groot starts with an ability that roots enemies in place. Once he’s done that, those unfortunate enemies are helpless to evade Rocket’s ability to blanket the area with explosions for massive damage. When the team encounters an enemy that’s too fast to strike, Groot can grab them, giving Gamora and Drax a chance to use one of their slower but more powerful attacks. Featuring the greatest musical hits of the '80s! Tactical Action-AdventureBeautiful alien landscapes, epic scale, and outstanding comedy writing that kept me laughing the whole game through. Bugs and glitches, lots of combat padding in the game's final act. Eidos-MontréalPC, PS4, PS5 (Played), Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch (Streaming)October 26, 2021Around 15 hours to complete the entire story mode, constantly searching for hidden goodies and occasionally restarting checkpoints due to glitches.  Though you’re only directly controlling Peter Quill, it feels like the Guardians are working together to win every battle. What seemed like a massive downside when the game was first announced is actually a rather neat way to make you the most important part of a powerful team of intergalactic heroes. You’re the glue that keeps the other four from murdering each other and being done with it.Fighting is fun, especially as Peter unlocks new powers for his Elemental Gun. Ice can freeze a foe, allowing them to be shattered into pieces. Electricity stuns enemies and can take down shields. Magma inflicts a damage-over-time effect. And then there’s the best power of all, wind. With wind, Peter can draw distant enemies to him, leaving them in a weakened, easily-beat-down state. And should Peter be standing near a high ledge when he shoots, the enemies are teleported into empty air, immediately falling to their death.It’s a combat system built for experimentation, but it doesn’t always hold up. There are battles where it’s obvious the game wants you to use powers in a specific way that’s not immediately clear, leading to me fumbling about the battlefield like an idiot until I figured it out. Other times battles will take place in confined spaces, and when you try to move out of those spaces, the game fades briefly before moving you back into the area where it wants you. And though battles are generally entertaining, there’s a point in a latter chapter where battles become more frequent, and start feeling like padding before the grand finale.Then there’s the huddle system. As your team fights, a huddle meter fills. When full, you can hit the shoulder buttons to call the team into a huddle. After a brief discussion about how the battle is going from your teammates, you’re given a pair of dialogue choices. The correct choice inspires and buffs the entire team, while the wrong choice only enhances Star-Lord. When the fight is rejoined, a random tune from the game’s hit-studded ‘80s soundtrack plays.There is nothing quite like heading back into battle with a massive, screen-filling boss to the sounds of Bobby McFerrin’s “Don’t Worry, Be Happy.” During one of the game’s dramatic final battles, I wound up Rick-rolling a powerful alien entity. Does the music make the battles better or worse? Yes. Also no. As much as I love the sheer absurdity of it all, I feel like some of the fights were cheapened considerably thanks to Peter Quill’s Walkman. As impressive as the game’s soundtrack is, there are times I would rather just stick to the regular combat music for dramatic effect. Just know that if you get similarly bothered, there is an option (mainly for streamers) to replace copyrighted music with unlicensed alternatives.I also wasn’t a big fan of the frequent bugs and glitches I encountered. While exploring alien vistas I kept losing members of the team, usually right before encountering an obstacle that required their special abilities to overcome. A hidden costume on a particularly icy planet remained out of reach because I needed Groot to raise a platform for me, and Groot kept going AWOL. Elsewhere I got stuck because I needed Gamora’s sword to cut down an obstacle and Gamora had fucked right off. These sorts of issues would sometimes resolve after reloading my last checkpoint. Sometimes they would not. There’s supposedly a day-one patch in the works that will fix most of the problems I had, but don’t be surprised if it’s still got the odd glitch.Despite the frustrating technical issues, I enjoyed nearly every moment of the 15 or so hours I spent playing Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy. I like the battles and banter. I enjoyed dropping unsuspecting enemies off of cliffs. I didn’t mind Rocket attempting to get me to answer “Quill’s Mom” to a question posed by a security AI. I loved Drax’s awkward attempts at flirting with Lady Hellbender. I adored every moment spent with Soviet space-dog Cosmo, who is truly the bestest of boys. I especially enjoyed the secret sixth member of the Guardians, Kammy the purple space llama.Just like the titular scrappy band of underdogs, Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy defied all of my expectations. What I expected to be an awkward mishandling of one of Marvel’s most unlikely superhero teams turned out to be one of the most faithful and entertaining depictions of the Guardians since their 2014 movie debut, and one of my favorite games of 2021.

Guardians of the Galaxy is not another Marvel’s Avengers-level missed opportunity for publisher Square Enix. Despite being a point of contention among fans when it was released, its complete focus on its central characters – and its decision to make Peter Quill a.k.a. Star-Lord the only playable one — greatly benefits the story it tells. And it’s the strength of this story that carries GotG a few steps above Square’s previous crack at the Marvel whip, even if it’s undermined by a lack of polish that really shouldn’t accompany a license of this magnitude.Guardians of the Galaxy tells an original story that sees the titular anti-heroes creating their own problem, which winds up having devastating ramifications for the galaxy they’re supposedly guarding. As part of a job-gone-wrong, Quill accidentally unleashes a mysterious entity that sets about taking over the galaxy alongside the Universal Church of Truth, a creepy cult led by priest Grand Unifier Raker. This sends the Guardians on an adventure spanning multiple planets, space stations, and the like, that players must shoot and puzzle-solve their way through.Players may only directly control Quill, though they’re still able to give directives to the other Guardians during combat. Each team member has four unlockable special abilities, all reflective of their own unique skill-set. Groot can lock enemies into place with his tree roots, while Rocket can unleash a devastating flurry of explosives. Meanwhile, Quill is solely armed with his two trusty pistols, though is able to imbue the pistols with special elemental powers as the game progresses.Combat is fast-paced and frenetic, though the lack of variety in Quill’s own arsenal holds it back. Elemental powers mix things up a little and can be used to counter specific enemies weak to certain elements, though he’s mostly resigned to shooting people with the same guns while his friends pull off the cool-looking moves. He has his own set of unlockable abilities, too, though it’s difficult to get too excited about a move where you throw a few grenades on the floor or use your jet boots for an extended period of time.Outside of each character’s unique abilities, there’s also the team-based Huddle, a special move that pulls the Guardians into a team talk where Quill is tasked with rallying the troops. This sees you selecting a dialogue option that complements the other Guardians’ thoughts — for instance, if they seem overly confident of victory, you tell them to keep their minds focused — but it’s far too easy to know exactly the right thing to say. I eventually found that the brief period of souped-up superheroes it offered was less attractive than just shooting my way through enemies and not having to sit through the Huddle.Unlike Marvel’s Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy leans heavily into its heroes’ comic book design rather than presenting us with off-brand versions of Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, and co. The same can be said of their personalities, too — Drax lives up to his Destroyer nickname, with him having already killed Thanos prior to the events of the game, while Peter Quill’s heritage is more in line with his comic book counterpart. Rocket and Groot’s adorable relationship is lifted straight from the MCU, though, while Gamora occupies a middle-ground between a stern assassin and a voice of reason.Each character goes through their own arc alongside the main story, though some are better presented than others. Drax’s should please Marvel fans who were upset with the MCU’s treatment of the character as comic relief, while Gamora’s feels rushed by comparison. Quill is depicted as a far stronger leader than Chris Pratt’s bumbling figurehead, and the Guardians of the Galaxy game actually does a better job of illustrating why these highly skilled warriors would follow Star-Lord’s command more than the MCU ever did.The draw of the Guardians has always been their unlikely friendship, and this is the focus here. There is constant banter between the protagonists throughout each mission as they expand on their history, share their opinion of the best approach to each situation, or simply rib on each other. Players are given the infrequent ability to choose Quill’s response in certain situations, too, though these options typically rotate between either empathizing with or chastising his partners. They have a moderate influence on the outcome of certain events, though it’s never difficult to figure out which option is the “right” path.However, while the witty dialogue comes thick and fast, this also ties into Guardians of the Galaxy’s biggest problem — the sheer number of visual, audio, and even occasional game-breaking bugs, glitches, and problems. Now, Square Enix has noted that a day one patch will focus on these, so these are known issues that will hopefully be resolved sooner rather than later. However, it’s no exaggeration to say that nearly every cutscene, shootout, or even gentle stroll to the next area is accompanied by at least one bug or glitch.Chief among these issues is almost every exchange between characters — some of which are integral to their development and plot exposition — being cut short by the player entering a new area or triggering a new cutscene that will stop the dialogue in its tracks. It got to a point where I’d deliberately have to stand still in order to hear out what my teammates had to say, as pressing ahead with the game would ensure they’d be cut off by the next batch of dialogue. While the plethora of other bugs and glitches can likely be resolved with a future patch or two, it’s difficult to see how the script routinely overrunning the on-screen action will be improved.The other bugs included, but were not limited to: characters refusing to move to the next destination and thus preventing any progress, on-screen button prompts remaining on the screen, characters T-posing during the middle of combat, the abilities menu refusing to open until the game was restarted, my health bar not regenerating, the camera getting stuck in cutscenes, and a particularly infuriating section where I spent a considerable amount of time trying to find the exit out of a cave, only to find that an essential line of dialogue hadn’t triggered.It remains to be seen how much the day one patch fixes, but there are so many little flaws bursting through its seams that it will be a gargantuan task to rectify all of them. Hopefully, all of the more glaring ones will be removed with the patch, and checkpoints are forgiving enough that the particularly egregious ones weren’t too debilitating. However, it’s still far too much jank for a Marvel game and brought back unfortunate memories of Avengers’ slew of launch day issues.Guardians of the Galaxy is a solid original story from Eidos Montreal that deviates from both the MCU and the comics, providing something for Marvel fans across mediums to enjoy. However, while it’s certainly a step up from publisher Square Enix’s Avengers, it suffers with its own notable bugs and glitches that detract from the on-screen action. The day one patch will hopefully tackle these problems, and if so this is a highly recommendable superhero game that doesn’t quite step it up like Insomniac’s Spider-Man series, though still does right by its unlikely group of misfit anti-heroes.Guardians of the Galaxy reviewed on PS5.

Destructoid,"darkThe whole “Square Enix has the Marvel license” thing didn’t start out so well. Marvel’s Avengers was somehow far too broad in scope when it came to its monetization and live-service strategy — and it skimped on content. It wasn’t a great match. But with Guardians of the Galaxy taking the exact opposite approach, it shows that we have hope yet to turn this Milano around. With room for improvement along the way.Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy (PC, PS4, PS5 [reviewed], Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S) Developer: Eidos-Montreal Publisher: Square Enix Released: October 26, 2021 MSRP: $59.99I won’t lie: I was extremely skeptical of Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy going in. I have experience with the characters from the source material and the MCU; and I feel like there was plenty of room to work with both mediums to make this cast a little more impactful than, say, a few of the stoic Avengers staples. Getting likenesses is a tricky business, and although the proper Avengers game had a lot more issues with the “off-brand” feel, the Guardians game allows most of the cast’s personality to shine, and dips into both wells. It’s clear that this is a character-driven game, and that the Eidos-Montreal team had an easier time juggling five core cast members and a complete-at-launch release, compared to a gigantic team and impending live-service DLC.We get to see Peter before he was Star-Lord and spend some time with him when lasers aren’t flying around. With intermittent flashbacks dealing with his old life on Earth, there’s some downtime to connect without having to dial everything up to 11. We hear tales of Drax and Gamora from what are essentially their past lives. We see how much Rocket cares for Groot on a constant basis, whether it’s playful ribbing or extreme anger when the latter is put in danger.I did have some issues acclimating to the performances, in spite of all this effort. Star-Lord and Rocket are…fine? They can be cantankerous when they need to be (and play off each other more than any other duo). The writing is sometimes on their side to showcase their personal highs and lows. Groot, similarly, is kind of hard to screw up: you have the kind eyes, the powerful stature, and the booming voice, and you’re good to go.On the opposite side of the spectrum, I really enjoyed this characterization of Gamora, and was at odds with Drax. Drax is incredibly hard to translate from the MCU as his comic counterpart is so different, and there are bits of both incorporated here, leading to some moments where you’re supposed to laugh, but just don’t.Gamora has a little more to work with, and gets a lot of fun moments that allow her to spread her wings beyond her portrayal in the MCU (even including her looser characterization in more recent films). She’s a believable badass, but there are layers, including a few small moments I won’t spoil. These sorts of qualities are where the Guardians game banks a lot of its goodwill. You know how banter is a huge focus in Dragon Age and Mass Effect, two of the closest analogs? It’s the same thing here — minus the fully open-world setting, as Guardians is linear and chapter-based. A lot of the time you’re with all five members: yourself as Star-Lord included. He’s the only person you have full control of, which helps give the game a more streamlined feel.The other big part of Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is the “choices” mechanic looming over micro and macro elements of the narrative. So….like many games before it, it completely falls flat a lot of the time. There’s some “X will remember that” moments that ultimately don’t really matter, and a few forks in the road that still lead to the same path in the end. The vast majority of choices I made didn’t compel me to immediately play again to see how differently things could have gone.There are also QTEs, and some “walk and talk” sections during linear paths, which leads to more bantering. Exploration is very limited with only a few forks in the road every now and then, though Star-Lord’s jet boots handle a lot of the heavy lifting when it comes to map design: letting the development team err on the side of verticality, and give a little more personality to Guardians‘ environments.While roaming around and not shooting or smashing stuff, you’ll solve very light puzzles, sometimes by ordering party members over to semi-obvious bits and bobs. Rocket has to go in vents and tinker with circuit boards, Drax moves giant rocks or platforms, Gamora can jump real high, that sort of thing. Like many pieces of Guardians of the Galaxy, it’s cute, and sometimes rote.There’s not a lot to it hours in, and while there was an opportunity to do some really cool things like introduce sequence-breaking or more interesting puzzles, it’s very one-sided in practice. Yet, it’s easier to get on board with this simplistic approach when there are so many accessibility options and toggles, even for in-depth control and combat nuances. A “time until last save” notification right on each pause screen is also super helpful when you need to take a break.Combat, which again, involves you directly controlling Star-Lord and issuing orders in the form of triggered abilities for everyone, follows the same approach. It’s point and shoot, occasionally dodge, and trigger team abilities when they’re on cooldown. Literal elemental weaknesses for Star-Lord’s main elemental gun add more tactical options over time, on top of a few cool team-based combos that you can use later. Think Ultimate Alliance character models smashing into each other.By and large, you can issue Groot and Rocket to handle crowd control, and Drax and Gamora (with Groot and Rocket to boot) to slam single targets, and stick with that tactic for the entire game. Or, in the case of most bosses, you can just spam everything on cooldown when they’re vulnerable: albeit with a very awesome-looking presentation on a grander scale, with some MMO-like combat tactics to account for.Every so often you can trigger a big super called a “huddle,” where you can listen to what your team is saying on-screen (“we’re isolated,” “they think we’re a joke”) and respond in kind with one of two options. If you shout things like “we need to fight as a team,” or “then laugh right back at them” respectively, you get a super boost. Again, very cute, but familiar, especially after you’ve done it 10 times.I can’t say it enough: the theme carries this game. There are plenty of non-MCU surprises — in fact, the game mostly deals with non-MCU characters — and also a few suspenseful moments, which are usually resolved very quickly. If a chapter was getting dull because of the same walk and talk, puzzles, and trash mobs, usually some sort of immediate story twist will come out of the woodwork and ask you to get invested again.Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy coasts by quite a bit on personality, and that’s definitely going to make it divisive. Playing through it myself, I was constantly torn. When it gets going and it’s firing on all cylinders, it’s fun. But it’s also exceedingly linear (in a negative sense in some aspects of the game) and many of the choices it offers are surface-level at best. Treat it like an arcadey weekend romp and you’ll be fine: bonus points if you already adore these lovable little bandits.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]AlrightSlightly above average or simply inoffensive. Fans of the genre should enjoy them a bit, but a fair few will be left unfulfilled.

Forbes,"Guardians of the GalaxyMarvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy feels like a game both ancient and ultra-modern. It’s a throwback to linearity in video games in a way we almost never see in AAA blockbusters anymore. And yet it’s also hyper-advanced in its storytelling, utilizing animation, voicework and a seemingly endless script to great effect.Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy, made by Eidos Montreal under the Square Enix umbrella, is the direct inverse of its sister game, Marvel’s Avengers, made by Crystal Dynamics (with some early help from Eidos as well). The game is determined to do nothing but tell a lengthy, straightforward story. No loot grinds, no live service elements, probably no DLC.It’s not as if single player story games are dead by any means, just look at Sony’s catalogue. But Guardians of the Galaxy has leaned so hard into this concept, it’s something I really have not seen in years. The game is relentlessly linear. There is nothing resembling an open world to explore, nor really even open sections within a linear story map like you might see in a more recent Uncharted or Last of Us game. You might go down a single secret path to find some resource or a new costume, but that’s as exploratory as it gets. And you cannot come back to previous locations to poke around further. Only forward, never back, is the Guardians’ motto here.This allows the game to do something unique, however, using an old concept to do something very modern with the script. Simply put, this is the most dialogue I have ever heard consistently in a game. Any game.I am sure there are games with more total dialogue, branching Mass Effect conversation trees and such, but the way Guardians is structured with its linearity means that there is probably never more than a span of 30 seconds in which Peter or your team is not talking. And it’s not canned lines, it is all current commentary on what’s happening in the story or in the action. The linearity here allows all the dialogue to feel fresh because you’re never not progressing the story forward. Hell, there are even unique lines when you decide to explore a path to find secrets, as your team will chastise you in various ways for going off mission (they are trolling Peter, the hero, not you, the player, so I didn’t find it annoying).Guardians of the GalaxyAnd the voicework here is mostly…great? A combination of visuals which make for beautiful character models and realistic animation, and quality voicework from a pretty unknown cast means you won’t get sick of the talking, which is more or less the backbone of the entire game. I was especially impressed with Rocket, Drax and Gamora, who stand toe-to-toe with their A-list MCU counterparts in terms of delivery. And by the end, lord knows they’ve all spoken more than the Guardians have in total across 3-4 different movies now. I was less enthused about this surfer dude iteration of Peter Quill whom I liked the least, and while I’d like to say he grew on me, but he mostly didn’t. But he’s tolerable, and I suppose meant to be kind of a doofus, and the rest of the cast really shines to compensate.As for the actual storyline, I won’t get into much detail as it’s a key part of the experience to uncover its layers. We start out trying to earn money from Lady Hellbender by capturing and selling her a rare monster, and end with trying to prevent the imminent destruction of the galaxy by a cultish church who is brainwashing entire planets. And there is a lot in between, and the story probably clocks in at about 15-20 hours, depending on how you play. I was sure it was ending a few different times and it just…keeps going. I’d argue there are some pacing problems in there as a result, but it mostly works, and creates a fantastic non-MCU Guardians story probably on par with anything we’ve seen onscreen so far. And Marvel fans will love the roughly 50,000 references and easter eggs the game contains.But actual gameplay? That’s…where things start to slip for me.You only control Star Lord, and your four teammates are essentially your “super moves” by extension. Peter has his own specials, but none of them seem as good as spamming your teammates abilities which all have absurdly low cooldowns and do far more than anything Peter dishes out. Gamora does huge damage, mainly to single targets. Drax does stun damage. Groot has CC lockdown. Rocket does AOE damage. Peter is mainly useful for matching elemental gun types to various shields, and then again, going back to spamming his teammates abilities. I would advise upping the difficulty to one level past what you normally would, as it felt almost a little too easy for me, I’d say, even the boss fights, which are mechanically neat but kind of a breeze. The game offers little challenge unless you really crank things up.I’d argue the lack of challenge extends to the puzzle element as well. In addition to commanding your teammates in combat, you also tell them to do certain things in the environment to get past obstacles. Gamora cuts vines and pipes, Drax smashes walls and floors, Rocket hacks doors, Groot bridges gaps. But after about an hour it’s just painfully obvious what the “solution” to every puzzle is, that again, there’s no meaningful thinking or going on here, just like there’s rarely a need for actual strategy in combat.Guardians of the GalaxyAnd just in terms of the “feel” of it all, combat is a bit too airy and Peter is too disconnected from the action with so much teammate ability spam. Even if Guardians laps Avengers in terms of storytelling and game structure, I think Avengers and its extremely good character kits trump Guardians here. I would love, for instance, to have played a version of this game where you hopped between five Crystal Dynamics-designed versions of the Guardians, each with their own gameplay. The Star Lord uber-control idea is…fine, but it’s outshined by all other aspects of the game.The worst bit of combat is easily the huddle mechanic, a flow-breaking concept that has Peter pause the battle talk to his teammates with a goofy dialogue matching minigame to give everyone a boost. This would have worked infinitely better as an instant summon ability, and it got so annoying I actively tried to avoid using it in combat, and only did when I accidently hit R1 and L1 together when I was trying to do something else. That’s how obnoxious it was.One thing I remain unclear about after playing all the way through is what actual story choices mattered in the game and what could have gone differently. You are often asked to side with one teammate or another, but you never really have any idea of what might have changed otherwise, and this does not strike me as a storyline with loads of different endings, though I could be wrong. The only way to find out is to I suppose, go check YouTube after launch, or play the game’s New Game Plus mode, but there’s little point to doing an entirely new playthrough as you will have literally nothing at all left to unlock in terms of skills or perks. So I can’t imagine doing that.I suppose we can now venture into the old “is Guardians worth $60?” debate. If you miss hyper linear story games with no live service BS, and are a big Marvel fan, then this might be the game for you. If you are hoping for Devil May Cry level combat and God of War type puzzles and exploration within a linear story, you will be disappointed. But I can safely say this is probably a better end product than most people were expecting, and that alone is a pretty big win for a game that felt like a bit of a risk and like it’s been lacking in buzz leading up to launch here. It has issues, but it gets a lot right, and pushes storytelling in ways I haven’t seen in this genre before.Score: 8/10A review code was provided by Square Enix for the purposes of this review.

We take a look at Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy.It's been almost a decade since the Guardians of the Galaxy had their radical reinvention via the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Since then, the team have become beloved pop culture fixtures, while new stories have continued to emerge from the movie and comic book spaces. However, the Guardians don't exactly have a rich video game history. They've certainly been featured in a few games, but this is arguably going to be their most high profile title ever.Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is conceptually interesting. It's a team-based game, but one in which players only take on the role of leader ""Star-Lord"" Peter Quill. It's a bold move, but one that works in practice. Square Enix and Eidos Montreal put forward a story worthy of the big screen or the inked pages. Unfortunately, there are some major quirks that keep it from the all-time comic book video game pull list.It's no hyperbole to say that the story for Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is one that's worthy of its own movie or comic book storyline. This version of the team follows a totally different continuity from the movies and the comics, similar to what Marvel's Avengers and Marvel's Spider-Man have done previously. Here, they've only been together for a few years. A major plot component is that the story takes place after a catastrophic Galactic War, one in which Thanos was killed and the Chitauri aliens were ultimately defeated. Out of the ashes of the Galactic War came the formation of the Guardians of the Galaxy, who basically band together to take on odd bounty hunting jobs to keep their bank accounts afloat.Part of what's interesting about the story is its pacing, as the main plot doesn't start up until several chapters in. This gives players time to get familiar with the game's supporting cast, including Nova Corps officer Ko-Rel, her daughter Nikki, Grand Unifier Raker of the Universal Church of Truth, beast tamer Lady Hellbender, and others. And, while the plot takes several turns throughout this 25-30 hour adventure, everything circles back around and converges by the end. While certain pieces of the story feel padded, nothing ever feels wasted. In the end, it feels like it's paced similar to a two-and-a-half hour Marvel Cinematic Universe movie.Speaking of the MCU, the individual Guardians are wonderfully fleshed out characters. They don't look particularly pretty. In fact, some of the character models are so displeasing to the eye that they're almost distracting. However, I won't fault the individual characterization. Star-Lord aims to be the best leader he can be, Gamora is searching for purpose in the galaxy beyond ""daughter of Thanos,"" Drax is struggling to trust Gamora and cope with his family's loss, Rocket is still a lovable jerk, and Groot... he is Groot. Beyond hitting their individual characters, Eidos Montreal does what few other games of this type pull off so well. It captures the team chemistry beautifully, as do the voice actors for each of the Guardians, who do a great job with their characters. Jason Cavalier, in particular, shines as Drax the Destroyer, truly sinking his teeth into the Katathian warrior. (Editor's Note: This review originally identified Drax's voice actor as Brandon Paul Eells, which was in error.)Throughout the game, whether there's action happening or whether the team is wandering towards their next objective, the banter between the Guardians is constant. Everyone talks to one another, team members butt into conversations, and sometimes Quill even needs to interject to cool down tensions, keep everyone focused, or change the subject whenever it's needed. The latter element is a player-driven mechanic and that leads to one of this game's other cool ideas. There's a lot of player-driven choice in this game.Whether Star-Lord's having individual conversations with other characters or whether he has to keep the team rallied together, players will constantly be prompted to make dialogue choices. There's a chunk of it that's inconsequential, outside of maybe keeping team morale up. However, there are certain parts in the game where Quill's choices will impact the story. Without spoiling the endgame, some of the choices that were made over the course of the game did end up mattering, in the sense that certain sequences were made easier or major combat encounters were removed entirely.Of course, choice also comes into play in the game's final moments. There appear to be multiple endings, some of which are impacted by who shows up in the game's final moments, others influenced by certain dialogue choices made over the course of the game, and some even affected by overall team chemistry. For example, there's a running gag at the start of the game over whether Drax should throw Rocket across a chasm in order to have him create a path for the rest of the team. These choices end up more consequential than they might seem, eventually affecting Rocket's relationship with Drax and with Quill.The problem with this is that there's no real indicator of how players can affect their ending. There's no way to know which choices matter and which ones don't. While some of the big choices may seem obvious when they come up, it's easy to ignore some little ones and wind up with an ending that leaves a sour taste in your mouth. This wouldn't be such a big deal, but this is a long game. Going back and changing one choice or doing one thing differently means potentially replaying 20 or so hours before you get to see how your new ending pans out.In discussing team chemistry, it's worth talking about how the Guardians work together. Star-Lord may be the leader, but it's in how he directs his friends that Eidos Montreal puts together a solid game.While Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is mainly a single-player action game, there's a lot of strategy involved and it revolves around the rest of the team. Each area is filled with environmental puzzles and players have to figure out how to best use everyone's individual strengths to proceed. For example, Drax can move giant objects to make platforming possible, Groot can create bridges to clear large gaps, Gamora can cut through objects to clear paths, and Rocket can squeeze into tiny areas and also hack electronics.These abilities are novel and go a long way towards making this game stand out. I do wish that the puzzles would get a little more sophisticated. In a few instances, some of these abilities need to be done in a certain order, but that's about as tough as things get. Outside of that, the hardest aspect of these puzzles is identifying which objects can be manipulated by using Star-Lord's visor. There aren't any real brain teasers that utilize these abilities, which could have made their use feel a little more memorable.Of course, the rest of the Guardians also assist in combat and this is where things get a little more fun. Star-Lord shifting his friends around during combat encounters gives this game a bit of an XCOM vibe. Sometimes, there's a sniper that's out in the distance, so you send Gamora out to take him out. Other times, there are heavy numbers of minor enemies, at which point you have Rocket blow them up with explosives. Or, maybe there's a heavy enemy who hits really hard, so you have Groot tie him up to give you a free shot.Guardian abilities can be upgraded over time through combat experience. The only thing wrong with this is that those abilities get maxed out well before the end of the game, leaving you with ability points that you can't really use anywhere. It would have been nice to see more abilities or even tiers to the existing ones.Those sure are some nice compliments to this game's combat, but unfortunately, that's where they stop.The other major element of combat comes from fighting with Star-Lord himself and Peter Quill must be quite a lover, because he's not really much of a fighter. The melee combat in this game is a frustrating mess. Even on lower difficulties, enemies counter Quill's punches frequently and can either knock him down or stun him. That's bad enough with the minor foes, but the major enemies can often knock his health down to almost nothing with a single blow. That's particularly frustrating, given how certain enemy units are balanced. Here's where I want to note that healer enemies somehow manage to have more health than their partners and absorb more damage. Having to deal with bullet sponges who can heal themselves and their allies is brutal and I had to face these foes multiple times in my playthrough.Alright, so maybe Quill's punches are about as light as one might expect from a half-human. I mean, he's not Captain America. Surely he compensates for that with his Element Blasters. Outside of combat, the Element Blasters add to the puzzle element, with Quill able to use certain blaster settings to find new paths or manipulate the environment in certain ways.In combat, the Element Blasters are perfectly fine, too... until they overheat. That happens a lot. Every enemy has a certain weakness, one in which an Element Blaster setting (cold blast or lightning, for example) can fill up their stagger bar quickly and open the door for the rest of the team to set them up for a finisher. Unfortunately, the charge on the Element Blasters is woefully small, so just as you're filling up an enemy's stagger bar, you'll be waiting for the blaster to cooldown. Worse, that cooldown is not short and there's no way to speed it up, either through perks or otherwise. That's just with one enemy. Now imagine having that problem with a dozen or so enemies, all at one time.Combat is topped off with the Huddle mechanic, in which Star-Lord calls his teammates over for a quick parley to recharge their abilities. I have mixed feelings about it, because its use comes across so weird. Everyone gathering around Quill grinning weirdly (""Quit smiling, you idiot,"" oh, wait, I used that line already) and talking about what an awesome fight they're having is oddly unsettling. I appreciate Eidos Montreal trying to push the teamwork motif further and this is as good a way as any to dig into the game's soundtrack, but the execution comes across as strange to me. Worse, since the button to control the Guardians and control Quill's Element Blaster are so close together, it's really easy to slip and hit both buttons at once and accidentally trigger the Huddle at a bad moment.The combat is easily one of the weakest elements in this game. The XCOM-style control of teammates is pretty cool, right up until they start calling out for help. That will happen more than once and it'll usually happen at the worst possible time. You could leave them dead, but since Star-Lord hits about as hard as quilted toilet paper, that's probably not the best idea. There is a way around helpless teammates, which I'll get to in just a bit, because that goes a long way towards helping save this aspect of the game.If anything in Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy made me groan more than the combat, it was the overreliance on quick-time events. There are QTEs everywhere in this game and they're the kinds where if you miss them, you're going back to the last checkpoint. It's such an outdated mechanic that it aggravates me to see major titles still use them.Fortunately, that leads to one of Guardians' better ideas and that's the custom difficulty setting. Players can adjust just about any setting they want, including how strong enemies are and how much damage players inflict. The more relevant ones help alleviate some of this game's bigger design issues. One affects how often a teammate finds themselves in danger and another affects QTEs directly. Unless they're doing it purely for curiosity, I can't imagine anybody playing with QTEs on and, sure enough, their removal makes for a more enjoyable experience. Good on Eidos Montreal for including a multitude of options, which feature several accessibility settings, as well.There is one more item worth mentioning and that's the subject of the Milano itself. There are a few instances where Quill can fly the Milano, either to escape a hairy situation or fly directly into combat. I only wish there had been more to this, because the Milano's flight controls are solid and I had a pretty good time trying to get through space. Sadly, there's such little time spent piloting the Milano that it winds up feeling like a tacked-on feature.There's a lot to love about Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy and it's balanced out by the bad stuff being really bad, whether it's the combat or the incessant QTEs. If I'm judging it on the Marvel scale, it's a game that doesn't feel quite as good as Marvel's Spider-Man, but feels better than Marvel's Avengers.I will say that like those two other Marvel games, Square Enix and Eidos Montreal seem to know what makes the Guardians of the Galaxy so special. They're a group of space misfits who wound up in each other's lives and became a makeshift family and that's a theme that carries through over the course of the entire adventure. As a Guardians of the Galaxy story, this holds up every bit as well as the best comic books and the two MCU movies. The way in which the story gets the team chemistry across should be lauded and it will be something that every Guardians fan will love. Plus, you probably don't need me to tell you that the game's soundtrack is outstanding.What Eidos Montreal does with player choice is also commendable, though it still feels like more could have been done. It's 2021 and I feel like I should be able to compare my choices and my ending with my friends and with the online gaming space. However, the way in which the studio weaves in player choice to the overarching narrative works well enough to warrant multiple playthroughs, including a few where you go off the beaten path to find a new outfit. Or, at least it would, if the combat wasn't so dreadful.Square Enix and Eidos Montreal don't exactly pull this job off flawlessly. In fact, it gets ugly at points. Yet, oddly enough, that feels very appropriate for Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy.This review is based on a PlayStation digital code provided by the publisher.

VG247,"You'll enjoy Guardians of the Galaxy if you go into it with the right expectations.Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is a curious thing - simultaneously one of my favourite games of the year and also undeniably flawed. Super-slick presentation makes it a must-play for those who put story first, however.Indulge me to open this review with a question and an answer. Can you talk about a video game without talking about other video games? Most of the time, I think the answer is yes - but every now and then a game comes along that simply cannot be divorced from its influences and context. Guardians of the Galaxy is one such game.In the case of GotG, that ‘other game’ is primarily Marvel’s Avengers, last year’s prestige action and game-as-service cross-over, that was clearly lavish in expense and vision but lacking in heart and execution. Avengers hasn’t really failed, but it hasn’t exactly been the roaring success one would hope for from the world’s hottest cinema property - and that perceived failure casts a long shadow, looming large over Guardians, which - though a stand-alone game - is also functionally a follow-up - the second Marvel game from Square Enix.With that context considered, here’s the good news: Guardians of the Galaxy doesn’t fall into the same trap as Avengers. Conversely, it also falls into other traps all of its own. On the whole it feels like a significantly better experience than its Earth-bound sibling, however - and I recommend it much more heartily.The primary offender in Avengers, of course, was its characters. These weren’t the film versions, but original creations. They were valid in their own right, but for whatever reason they were met with derision, compared to those knock-off toys you find in dollar stores. The adventures of The Astonishing Bulk and the Metal Fella; that sort of thing. My hypothesis has always been that the problem was never in the costume design or in not securing the rights to Downey Jr.’s face - it was an issue of execution. By being successful in building a new version of its crew, Guardians proves it. Through a deftly-paced story that’s unafraid to take a breather from the action, Eidos Montreal has delivered a new version of the Guardians crew that complements and even rivals the cinematic versions, stepping out of the shadow cast by James Gunn’s Guardians to stand alongside his interpretation. These quieter moments are where Eidos Montreal’s Guardians of the Galaxy earns its keep, with powerful worldbuilding and strong characters - the Deus Ex DNA is most strongly expressed. The Milano, the Guardians’ ship, changes between chapters like Mass Effect’s Normandy - you can always learn more about your crew by exploring between missions, while collectibles gathered in the field trigger optional conversations with your buddies. Perhaps the best example of quick-fire fleshing out of a character happens early on, where a flashback depicts some of Peter Quill’s life on Earth as a long-haired, metal-loving teenager. This area is full of gleeful character building minutiae - some interactive, some not. Posters on the wall depict a mix of real and fictional 80s movies. Peter owns a copy of Deathtrap Dungeon, which is a sort of meta nod, having of course been written by former Eidos boss Ian Livingstone...In fact, the game is practically brimming with this licensed stuff. In a way, it’s one of the areas in which it feels most filmic. In those same recurring childhood flashbacks, it’s Peter’s birthday - and he has an appropriate 80s gaming-themed cake. It would’ve been easy for Eidos Montreal to use Space Invaders - Square Enix owns it - but they went out and got Pac-Man from Namco, because that’s the legitimate, ‘real’ game of the era. There’s weight in this, as in many of these additions; they’re not just winks to the fans, but effective worldbuilding. All of this has been done in games before, of course - it’s Nathan Drake having dinner and playing Crash Bandicoot, writ large - but it’s particularly effective in Guardians, a franchise sort of rooted in Peter’s pop culture obsessions.One of the most significant elements of selling these characters is depicting emotion - and Guardians has some of the most impressive facial animations I’ve seen in a game of this kind. There’s a caveat here, which is that scenes are split into two distinct camps - the hand-animated, cinematically directed stuff and the shot-reverse-shot ‘in-game’ conversations that have stiff canned lip-sync - but the major story beats are fabulously presented. Regardless of which type of scene you’re watching, these characters are charismatic as hell. For every weird or slightly unnatural expression, there’s about ten where the characters look really good. It’s so good that Guardians can get away with something games rarely bother with - cutting to silent reaction shots, where Quill wincing at something Drax said or Rocket seething with anger are absolutely sold through the animation.Other elements similarly shine. The banter between the teammates is fantastic. I love the dialogue choice system, where it’s usually timer-based, meaning you have a choice of things to say or the option to say nothing at all. Answering quickly, early, can interrupt the person you’re talking to mid-sentence. It feels organic and natural, though the way choices impact the story is more superficial. A choice early on might cancel and skip a challenging combat encounter later, but little else. It doesn’t matter, though, because the immediate reward of alternate dialogue and character beats is powerful enough as it is.It’s difficult to talk about this story in depth without hitting spoilers, so I won’t. I’ll keep it simple and just say - I love it. It’s one of the most emotionally effective video games in some time, and stands distinct from the movie Guardians. It has a few particularly powerful ‘playable’ story moments that really do give you pause - and I think it’s one of the most exciting and memorable story-driven games in a long while.Combat and moment-to-moment play is another, less flattering story. It’s decent switch-your-brain-off fun, but ultimately doesn’t live up to the rest of the game. The core issue is that movement feels relatively sloppy and loose. This leads to a chaotic feel which does sort of match up with how you’d expect a scrappy upstart like Peter Quill to fight, uneasy on his rocket boots, but too often it just doesn’t feel good - perhaps best demonstrated in the stilted way his jet boots work for vital world-traversing double jumps. They just feel jerky and off, even though they accomplish the task well enough.That slapdash sort of feel feeds into all of the battles, which are frequently explosively over-the-top and disorderly. Like I said - chaos. It fits the dysfunctional Guardians crew - but it also lacks weight. As Star-Lord you fire blasters that have a Gears-style active reload and elemental powers that you unlock over time. There’s also basic melee. Meanwhile, you can call upon the AI-controlled Guardians to perform special moves to help you out. The issue is it can often be difficult to focus on the timing of your advanced reload or which ability you’re causing a teammate to trigger, because there’s always so much going on. Battles are busy, and it feels as though Eidos Montreal dialed back the difficulty - so it’s full-on, but not really very challenging, even on hard mode. Out of battle, you’re constantly using your team’s abilities to progress through the environment. Gamora has to cut through things. Rocket can squeeze through small gaps and hack panels and the like. Groot can extend his roots and branches to create bridges across chasms. Drax can pick up heavy items and move them around, in turn allowing you to create pathways up high, and so on. For most of the game you have to order the crew to perform these actions, and it’s up to you to read environmental clues that tell you where abilities can be used. This is used for core progression but also to hide optional secrets, like costume unlocks. In a cute story twist, however, as the team coalesces some characters start using their traversal abilities on their own, at least for obvious story-progressing moves. I really like this aspect of the game.All of this taken together offers up a result that feels fine, but also a little bland. An acquaintance who was also playing the game early described it as a knock-off PlatinumGames sort of thing, which is harsh and not something I’d agree with - but I also see where they’re coming from. Be that as it may, it ultimately doesn’t matter. The combat really serves as a vehicle to deliver narrative, either through ongoing in-battle dialogue or by seeing you from one scene to the next. The story is where the money is - and one gets the impression that the game knows it.By dodging the eager game-as-service guff, Guardians of the Galaxy can focus on being something more compelling - even if you won’t play it for as long. For its ten-plus hour runtime, you’ll enjoy a thrilling, gripping, funny, and surprisingly heartfelt adventure. The game built around that narrative framework isn’t earth shattering - but it is enough scaffolding to allow the story to shine. You have to understand what Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is going into - but if you do, one of the finest narrative games of the year awaits. Switch your brain off, give yourself over to its story, and you’ll find much to enjoy.Disclaimer: played on Xbox Series X, code provided by publisher.
