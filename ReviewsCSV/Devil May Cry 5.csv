Eurogamer,"Better the devil you know.Style is everything, and Devil May Cry 5 has it in spades. It's in the blithe way rakish new character V holds a book of poetry and reads from it in the middle of battle. It's in the adolescent aggression that flows through the attacks of Nero, the character who was front and centre in the last numbered entry finally coming into his own here. It's in the swagger of Dante - oh that sweet, sweet swagger - who brings along every trick he's learned in the series' long history alongside a few new ones. It's an outrageously broad vocabulary of punishment that Devil May Cry 5 boasts. In full flow Devil May Cry 5 is a savage, spectacular action game, stylish to the extreme if not exactly fashionable. After the Shoreditch edge of 2013 prequel DmC: Devil May Cry, this is a return to the more classically teenage boy concerns of old; it's all long hair, leather jackets, motorbikes and demons and music that raaaaaaaaaaawwwks. I absolutely love it, even if perhaps the one misstep here is a failure to acknowledge Ninja Theory's frequently wonderful, wrongly maligned spin-off that feels a little like capitulation. This is Devil May Cry as you remember it from its noughties pomp, a rediscovery and thorough retooling rather than a reinvention. And so it feels and plays like a PlayStation 2 game. Maybe you see that as a slight, but I certainly don't intend it to be - PlayStation 2 games were awesome, and I admire Devil May Cry 5 for forgoing most mod cons to deliver a game that's unashamedly old school (save for the spectre of microtransactions, admittedly, though they're so slight that after my first playthrough I had to ask Capcom if they'd been removed entirely - they're still there, it turns out, as a shortcut to unlocking moves, but so generous is Devil May Cry 5's economy you've got to wonder why Capcom invited ill-will by keeping them in at all). The focus here is on action, and on pushing it to new extremes, and so intent is Devil May Cry 5 on doing so it doesn't have much time for other embellishments. That action is exquisite, thankfully, and more lavish than ever before. This isn't merely the feel of 60fps, but rather the real thing (on the X and Pro at least - base consoles do a noble job of keeping up, I'm told, and Digital Foundry will be along to do its thing shortly), and in the hand it's just dandy. The camera, which is freed up from Devil May Cry 4's stiff and semi-fixed offering, does a good job of keeping everything in frame, and there's a giddying amount to keep track of in what's always a fantastic looking game. The setting helps. Devil May Cry 5 takes place in Red Grave City, a lightly reimagined London with twisted little spins on recognisable places. An analogue of Regent Street gets torn asunder by a demonic apocalypse, while Burrow Market is based on - well, you can probably figure that one out yourself. It's dark and gothic and moody, even before you descend into the underworld, but Devil May Cry 5 wears the aesthetic well, always keeping on the right side of the thin line between stylish and sulky. As does its story, told via sumptuous cinematics that have the RE Engine flexing its muscles. It's standard the-stakes-have-never-been-higher stuff that centres on the core enigma of new character V, offering up few surprises in its twists and turns. Amid all its absurdities and contrivances, though, it finds an emotional throughline, thanks to an abundance of character and a neat structure. There's not quite the blunt backtracking of Devil May Cry 4, but it's certainly economic with its backdrops, telling a tale that winds throughout the course of a single day (with a handful of flashbacks thrown in for good measure). Did it make me cry? Of course not, but it did make me laugh out loud on more than one occasion, and the cutscenes have a cinematic swagger all of their own. That Devil May Cry swagger is at its most pronounced in the action itself, of course. Levels are lavish, if curiously old-fashioned - there are awkward platforming sections, puzzles that are there to be blunt-forced rather than seriously thought through - and it's here that Devil May Cry 5 feels the most dated. Perhaps it's because we've been spoiled by the set-pieces and flair of Bayonetta and its sequel - both those games having come since the last numbered Devil May Cry, somewhat shockingly - but there's that strange feeling of playing a game so rooted in its PlayStation 2 origins, told with the muscle and flair of contemporary Capcom and its RE Engine. It looks great, in short, but plays it very straight. When those invisible barriers pop up and you're forced into combat, that mandate of serving up age-old thrills with modern visuals comes into its own. Devil May Cry 5 offers up three characters - locked off at certain points in the 20-mission campaign - who are so diverse in style it ends up feeling like three very different games. Happily, each one is as enjoyable as the other. Nero retains his grabby moveset from Devil May Cry 4, though it's flourished by his acquisition of the Devil Breaker - a prosthesis that can be swapped out with consumables acquired and loaded out before missions or found on the battlefield. It inspires a slightly strange, counter-intuitive feeling at first - we're so used to having our entire vocabulary to hand in action games - but it opens up a new layer of strategy, and several new layers of depth. Each type of Devil Breaker comes with its own attributes and moves, so one moment you might have access to a shockwave, while another the ability to heal. The permutations are dizzying, and make playing Nero a constant journey of discovery, and if, like me, you felt his starring role in Devil May Cry 4 felt something like an act of Metal Gear Solid 2-esque misdirection, then here he finds something like redemption. He even comes close to stealing the show. As does V, Devil May Cry 5's new addition who plays quite unlike anyone else in the series' past (well, okay maybe a little bit like one other character, but let's not go there for fear of spoilers). A sorcerer-style character, with more than a hint of Dragon's Dogma in the way he goes about business, V introduces ranged play as he fights from afar with the help of familiars - the avian Griffon, the panther-like Shadow and the demon Nightmare, all who can be controlled remotely before V steps in to finish the job off with his cane. It's a very different rhythm, and a welcome one too even if, in comparison to his companions, V ends up feeling a mite under-developed come his story's end.Those familiars might seem, well, familiar, too, having all featured as enemies of one sort or another in the series' very first outing. Devil May Cry 5 is full of such throwbacks and fan service, and of course there's no greater throwback than Dante himself, a playable compendium of the entire history of Devil May Cry. In the hand, he feels exactly as he should, and so painstaking is the commitment to make him faithful to his past selves at times playing Devil May Cry 5 feels more like you're engaging in a Resident Evil 2-esque remake than something entirely new. Switchable styles return, allowing you to flick between Trickster, Gunslinger, Swordmaster and, of course, Royal Guard, giving you access to different movesets that can be used in tandem with Dante's arsenal. The sheer breadth of it all can feel a little unwieldy at first, though you're given plenty of room to grow into it, and there's the promise of depths to be mined for countless playthroughs. It's all culled from familiar stuff, but this is the best Dante has ever felt. And as familiar as it is, there's still room for a new move here and there. The Cavaliere is Dante's headline new acquisition, a motorbike that can be torn in half to cleave through enemies. Or, if you'd prefer, just pull off an endo and grind the rear wheel into an enemy's face, a move as preposterous as it is satisfying. It's silly to the extreme, but nailed with the exquisite execution that can only come through a deathly serious approach. Such is the charm with Devil May Cry, really, an action game of outrageous extremes delivered with a craftsman's touch. Devil May Cry 5 is an inescapably backwards-looking title, though in referencing its past it discovers and invents whole new depths. It's the kind of thing where the first playthrough feels like simply the warm-up before you explore those reaches further with the help of higher difficulty levels, and that rewards you with spectacle the more you master it. Is it the measure of the action titles that come out of that other studio in Osaka? At times it feels a little too retrograde to be the best in class, but I'm certain it's the best Devil May Cry there's been yet - which is still quite the claim to be able to make. This is a more vintage type of action, though that ends up serving Devil May Cry 5 incredibly well. Style like this never really goes out of fashion, after all.

Buy it SteamDevil May Cry 5 is a 16-hour exploration of the hundreds of ways a magical man might hit a demon. There are swords and guns, of course, which you use interchangeably to create flowing, acrobatic combos. Alternatively, Devil May Cry’s ageing original hero Dante can hit demons with two halves of a haunted motorbike. Nero can slap on one of seven mechanical arms that can punch enemies with a big electric fist, or shoot rocket fists that punch demons from a distance. The magical antihero V commands a demonic condor and a panther to hit demons for him. All of these approaches look sensational, and feel so good that I’m happily ploughing into new game plus when the review is already finished. It hasn’t been a hard one to write because Devil May Cry 5 is simply one of the best games about hitting demons ever made.You switch between Nero, V, and Dante as the story dictates across DMC5’s 20 missions. A demon called Urizen is using a bad tree called the Qliphoth to drain the city of all its blood and it’s up to the trio to fight through his minions to stop him. The story is preposterous, genuinely funny at points, and supported by earnest performances and quality performance capture. Though many of the areas you visit can be simplistic and a touch monotone and washed out, it’s a decent enough setting for tremendous combat encounters.In classic Devil May Cry fashion you clear the level room-by-room and collect ranking scores from each encounter that feed into an overall score for the chapter. The point isn’t merely to survive, but to reach the upper echelons of the scoring system and claim the coveted, ridiculous ‘Smokin’ Sexy Style!’ title. The game marks your homework as you play and deducts points for repeating combos and taking hits. The game really sings as you start fighting at SSS level, switching weapons and zooming around the combat space to build a gorgeous improvisational combo of sword slashes, fire gauntlets punches, shotgun blasts and dazzling robot arm attacks.If you'd rather kick back admire the combat there's an 'auto' mode that executes some advanced combos for you—accessible by clicking in the right stick at any point in a level. Between that and the 'human' difficulty level, this is the most accessible Devil May Cry game yet for new players. In a series that proudly offers a high level of challenge, it's good to see players of all skill levels taken into account.Each character has their own fighting style, but there’s plenty of opportunity to find your own preferred approaches within each moveset. Nero’s basic abilities let him attack with his sword and revolver. You can hold fire button to charge the gun and deliver bullets that can stagger enemies, and you can rev your sword like a motorbike to power it up and access fiery new moves. Nero can also whip enemies closer or pull himself towards larger enemies with a tether he fires out of his right arm.Within this stable framework of go-to combos you use Nero’s disposable robot arms to mix up combos or move around. The Gerbera arm lets you fire shockwaves that propel Nero away from enemy attacks, and the Punch Line can detach and fly around as Nero rides it. The arms break if you take a hit during their special move, but you tailor an arsenal of up to eight arms before a mission starts and detonate them whenever you like. Some arms do give you an advantage over certain enemies—the many lashing hits of the whip-like Helter Skelter can shatter guarding enemies, for example—but the system is lax enough to let you pick the arms you really enjoy using in any situation.You can make any enemy in the game wear a dumb hat. It even works on giant tentacle-faced rhino monsters. It even works on bosses.If Nero was the only playable character this would still be a fine game, but Devil May Cry 5 offers so much more. Dante can switch between four melee weapons, four ranged weapons, and four combat styles on the fly. This spectacular range of attacks in part harks back to previous Devil May Cry games with the classic sword combos and stinger dash, but his new abilities are even better. Dante can switch out his guns for a hat and scarf combo that lets him attack with the game’s red orbs currency. Lock on and launch a forward attack and Dante throws the hat onto the targeted enemy’s head. While demons are wearing the hat they shed orbs that you can collect and then throw right back at them. The hat is great because it demonstrates DMC5’s wilful tendency to be incredibly smart and stupid at the same time. You can build your whole combat style around the hat’s clever orb switching mechanics, and in a random nod to Journey, enjoy the way the red scarf grows longer as you collect orbs. But perhaps more importantly, you can make any enemy in the game wear a dumb hat. It even works on giant tentacle-faced rhino monsters. It even works on bosses.Devil May Cry 5 seems to be well optimised for PC, running at a comfortable 60 fps for the duration. There is a dedicated and comprehensive PC options menu that lets you tweak anti aliasing, lens flare, motion blur, subsurface scattering, shadow quality, shadow cache, refresh rate, and much more. You can rebind keyboard and mouse controls, though a control pad is hugely recommended.V is the palate cleanser of the three. He has a less developed set of abilities, but they feel quite different to Nero and Dante. V struts around the edges of the battle reading poetry from his book as his pet demons rip up enemies. The melee attack button controls attacks with V’s Panther, Shadow. The ranged attack command controls his eagle, Griffon. Once you’ve landed enough hits to build up your super gauge, you summon a massive oily golem called Nightmare to clobber everything into a near-death state. The demons can’t actually kill anything, so you have to teleport V around the battlefield to deal final blows with his cane. He does this as nonchalantly as possible.V’s style feels sloppier than Dante and Nero. The panther seems to just do its own thing sometimes and both creatures can teleport back to V’s side at inappropriate moments. If there are intricacies to the control system that stop this from happening, I haven’t found them. However, with a couple of move unlocks V reliably hits SSS rank thanks to the demons’ various area-of-effect attacks, which reliably overlap to juggle enemies. V's sections are a fun power trip and a nice breather from Nero and Dante’s surgical combat styles.Between missions you can pour red orbs into weapon abilities to unlock new moves. At some points you find payphones that summon the Devil May Cry van, driven by wisecracking tech support character Nico, who delivers some of the campaign’s funnier putdowns. Here you encounter the minor irritation of having to buy each Devil Breaker Nero arm that you plan to use. This, and a couple of poor boss fights are the main factors that really let the game down.Nero, Dante, and V don’t reach their full potential until the end of your first run through. The next difficulty level remixes every combat encounter and lets you keep all of your unlocks. The refresh is so extensive that it makes the main campaign feel like a mere tutorial, and this is before Capcom adds the bloody palace gauntlet mode in April. I’ve been hitting demons in this game for 19 hours so far, and I can easily see myself putting in 19 more. The setting lacks the flair and imagination of the genre behemoth Bayonetta, and those boss fights make it a slightly more uneven experience, but there’s a greater variety of combat styles and a higher degree of challenge that will will keep me playing until Capcom hopefully releases another one. If you enjoy third-person brawlers DMC5 is a must, and if you've never tried one before, this is a great place to start. What a treat.Three great characters and a beautiful, fluid combat system make this a must-buy for hack-and-slash fans.Part of the UK team, Tom was with PC Gamer at the very beginning of the website's launch—first as a news writer, and then as online editor until his departure in 2020.

Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy.The best parts of Devil May Cry 5 aren't when I'm being most challenged, they're actually when I can cut through that challenge, when I'm in full flow pushing buttons without having to think about it, mentally flicking through a menu of outlandish moves to weave my own varied combos. Of course, make no mistake, the game has its fair share of hard-as-nails boss encounters and a bevy of increasingly hard difficulty modes that can absolutely make me crush my controller into a fine dust. But it's watching the style meter ticks up, adding extra layers to the pulse pounding soundtrack with my moves that's the major appeal. Devil May Cry 5 is an absolutely stunning return to form that builds on improvements Ninja Theory's spin-off and reimagining DmC. But for all the bright sparks, spurts of blood, raging fires and more action hitting the screen at once - all gloriously rendered in Capcom's own Resident Evil 7 RE engine - it’s always the character you’re controlling that’s your real focus. The true genius of Devil May Cry 5 is that it's not just a great action game - it's three. You play as Dante, Nero and V, and each of these playable characters are so unique that I might as well be playing different games that share a narrative. These are no simple reskins. As you fight your way through hordes of demons on your way to Qliphoth, the massive demon tree from Hell that's invaded Red Grave City, it's easy to see that each character is based on the same framework. Everyone has a long range attack, a close range attack, a dodge/evade, a lock on, and a couple of unique moves mapped to other buttons and so on. The rating system revolves around avoiding being hit, and making sure you're using a variation of moves, regardless of who you play as. But that's where the similarities end.Nero's intricacies like his heavy-hitting revolver, the sword with motorbike throttle handle that you can rev mid-combo for stronger attacks, and more return. But this time, his unique arm - a literal demon arm - has been stolen for plot reasons, meaning he's got a slot for an interchangeable robot arm. These, known as Devil Breakers, are littered around the levels to pick up or available to buy from the customisation shop. From abilities ranging from whips to rocket punches, they're all pretty crazy, and always come with the ability to grapple enemies from a distance, which is handy. However, you can't switch them out on the fly, which feels a little annoying at first, though it's clear that it's meant to encourage you to mix up the powerful moves to get through them. You can break them entirely, which lets you unleash a powerful attack and switch to a new arm, but it'll just be to whatever is next in your arm magazine. Seriously. Particularly intense moments see deft use of all the arms in your magazine to run rings around your enemies. It's terrific fun, but so much so that the Devil Breakers can overshadow things like Nero's Exceed system - the robo-arms are just more well developed. It's easy to get carried away and forget to make best use of Exceed when you're distracted with the Devil Breakers, but it does end up feeling pretty satisfying when you do manage it.Dante is the least changed from his previous appearances. He's still all about swapping between a large arsenal of guns and close-quarters weapons on the fly; as well as switching styles between Gunslinger, Trickster, Sword Master, and Royal Guard, which give you access to different moves depending on what you have active. Considering you can switch between all of these mid-combo, the options are immense. Fittingly you don't get to play as him until around the midpoint of the game, so the slightly more complex aspect of switching between all these things feels much easier by that point. New weapons offer great new twists on his gameplay, feeling right at home alongside returning and revised classics - a fitting metaphor for Devil May Cry 5 as a whole.It's V that offers the freshest gameplay for the series, and understandably would make veterans the most hesitant. Instead of getting involved in the action himself, he summons demons to do the dirty work first before zapping in with a finishing move. You have the option to summon three demons, which are all based on enemies from the first game, but functionally they provide the same roles as the other two devil hunters’ weapons.Griffon fires long range zaps, and the panther-like Shadow uses claws and tentacles. The main difference is you're remotely controlling them, giving you a fresh perspective on encounters as you hang back, waiting to land that final strike with your cane. Summoning the third demon, Nightmare, uses your devil trigger meter, and he'll mostly just destroy everything around him without you having to worry about it. V adds a new dimension to the series that proves Capcom can continue to innovate as well as refine what came before.All three characters team up to take down the demon tree that's torn up this sort of “Not London”, Red Grave City. The ruined city has some interesting environments you don't get to see a lot in games, and being from the UK it was nice to see designs inspired by where I live, even if that's just things like big red public telephone boxes (which you use to call up Nico, the engineer of Nero's arm, and all-round customisation shopkeeper queen). While fun to a degree, the settings do at times lean towards the same colour palettes of browns and reds, especially as the action moves deeper into the Qliphoth tree. It would have been exciting to see the inside riff on the idea of bright, bizarre flora more than the repeated thorny vine theme, as the bright early morning colours of the previous levels felt very fresh.That doesn't detract too much from the game's appeal as a whole though, especially as each character has unique missions, which is a big step away from the huge amount of repetition in Devil May Cry 4. At points you'll even see the others fighting their own way through sections in the distance, which is rather cleverly drawn from actual player combat data. Perhaps you'll even see me in the distance! Because each of the 20 or so missions is one character or the other, that doesn't leave you with a whole heap of missions per character, but that also means nothing really overstays its welcome. The appeal is, as always with Devil May Cry, on replaying for more stylish scores, to challenge higher difficulties, and find all the hidden orbs and secret missions.Even on easier difficulties the game retains a reasonable amount of challenge and plenty of options to feel like you're overcoming them with stylish scores without being too unforgiving. The option for the game to give you auto-combos also helps as an entry point for new players. For a game that can have such a high skill ceiling with crazy combos, it's excellent to see genuine care taken with welcoming newcomers. The story though is mostly going to be hot nonsense for those unfamiliar with the series, as it references and pays off on a surprising amount of lore - though enough is unique to this adventure and explained to the point where it makes a certain amount of thrilling sense. It's a wild, exhilarating ride from start to finish.Reviewed on PS4 Pro and Xbox One.PLAY editor Oscar Taylor-Kent first joined Official PlayStation Magazine in 2018, and was involved with the long-standing mag’s rebrand into PLAY before becoming editor.

Metro GameCentral,"Dante and Nero return for Capcom’s outrageously over-the-top action sequel in a game that will delight both new fans and old.Video games are all about second chances, and third and fourth and however many other lives you’re granted. Perseverance can overcome almost any obstacle, whether you’re a gamer trying to beat that final boss or a developer trying to ensure the survival of a beloved franchise. Devil May Cry has had its ups and down, with two controversial entries that still divide the fanbase, and that’s made things difficult for a style of game that’s previously never enjoyed much mainstream appeal.We always felt 2013 reboot DmC: Devil May Cry was poorly treated by fans, and we know, after having spoken to him, that series overseer Hideaki Itsuno feels the same way. There are some welcome nods to the most recent game here, but it’s also made very clear that this is a direct sequel to the previous numbered entries – and not the soft reboot some may have been expecting.For those not familiar with the series, Devil May Cry is part of a small sub-genre that’s never really had an unanimously accepted name but which encompasses Bayonetta, Ninja Gaiden, Heavenly Sword, and, arguably, the early God Of War games. Devil May Cry was the originator of the concept though, with both it and Bayonetta created by PlatinumGames’ Hideki Kamiya. Bayonetta has been the standard bearer for the genre in recent years but now has a serious rival again, because this is the best Devil May Cry has ever been.We’re glad there’s a ‘History of DMC’ summary available from the game’s main menu because we’re not sure we could do the enjoyably nonsensical plot justice. The basics are very simple though: series lead Dante is a demon hunter (while also being part demon himself) and is hired by a mysterious man named V to investigate a series of supernatural attacks. This brings him to a fictionalised version of London, where a gigantic demonic tree, that feeds on human blood, has sprouted up.There is nothing subtle or plausible about Devil May Cry’s storytelling and for many that’s part of the appeal. The cocky bravado of Dante, and fellow demon hunter Nero, is cheesy and over-the-top but in such an earnest manner it’s somehow endearing. How seriously it’s meant to be taken is always difficult to tell (especially after Itsuno explained the concept chu-ni to us in an interview last year) but it leads to a lot of mostly intentional comedy and some wonderfully over-the-top cut scenes.But Devil May Cry is not one of those games where you get to see the characters participate in all manner of athletic action during a cut scene and then find out the in-game action is far more mundane. Fighting as stylishly as possible is entirely the point of Devi May Cry, with the game constantly grading your performance – in terms of skill, fluidity, and variety of moves – to S-rank and beyond. That could easily be seen as discouraging for newer players but one of the great achievements of Devil May Cry 5 is how accessible it makes itself without compromising the core gameplay.Not only are there multiple difficulty modes and an auto-assist option for combos but every gameplay concept and technique is carefully explained and introduced in a way that allows you to experiment and practice as much as you like. Devil May Cry 5 can get quite hard towards the end but the real challenge comes from bettering your own scores, not simply getting through the game, and that allows it to be appreciated by all kinds of different players.What also helps is that the game features three very different playable characters, with you often having the option to pick which one you want to play as in each mission. Nero is clearly the beginner’s option, with a simple mix of guns and a sword he can rev with what looks like a motorcycle throttle. In that sense he works very similarly to his appearance in Devil May Cry 4 but he starts the game missing an arm – thanks to the same demon tree-sprouting bad guy – and can replace the missing limb with a range of prosthetic ones that imbue different special abilities, from stopping time to lightning attacks.By comparison, Dante has a more complex moveset and is when the game bears the closest resemblance to Bayonetta. Dante can utilise much more complex combos between guns and melee combat and can also turn into a demon for a few seconds. But on top of that he can also change combat styles via the D-pad, to emphasise guns, melee attacks, defence, or agility. These can be ignored at first but give a clear advantage when fighting different types of enemies.More moves and abilities can be bought from shops (including using real money, rather disturbingly, although we certainly never felt the need to use microtransactions), which allows you to increase the complexity of the game at your own pace. Each character also has their own individual skill tree to unlock, using items collected from defeated foes. Even with Dante the game never has quite the same range and complexity of moves as Bayonetta, but the combination of different characters and abilities ensures it never feels shallow by the comparison.Both Dante and Nero are veterans of the series but the third playable character, V, is brand new. He uses a cane and is physically very weak, so he can’t fight enemies directly – only finish them off once they’ve already been injured. Instead he uses demons to fight for him: a machinegun-equipped bird, a Venom-esque panther, and a giant goelm-like creature as his special move (whose summons meter can be increased by reading from a book and making V even more vulnerable).V still uses the same underlying controls as the other two characters, since he’s basically engaging with a similar mix of ranged and melee attacks, so taking control of him isn’t quite as disorientating as it might sound, but trying to keep him safe while he organises the attacks is a pleasingly different challenge. V is so good, in fact, that he almost risks unbalancing the game, as we kept wanting to use him instead of the others. Having a choice is clearly for the best though and further increases the compulsion to replay missions.That desire is fuelled further by a huge collection of very enjoyable boss battles and a wide selection of optional extras to collect and find along the way – not just Nero’s robot arms but optional weapons that include a pair of nunchakus that transform into a giant match and a motorcycle that can be broken apart into two giant circular saws. It’s all fantastically over-the-top and demonstrates that such a traditionally ‘video game-y’ release can be as self-indulgently imaginative as it likes and still remain surprisingly accessible.Alan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNew Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart bundle is £50 off reveals leakTop 10 new Halloween board games and tabletop RPGs 2023In terms of flaws the game has no real Achilles heel, although inevitably not everyone will get on with the cheesy characterisations and silly plot. And while the combat is very welcoming for novices the camera and lock-on system could certainly be more helpful and requires a lot of manual adjustment.Our only other complaint is that the backdrops remain very static and inert, a problem the genre has always suffered from – presumably because all the processing power is put into maintaining a 60fps frame rate. There are usually a few destructible items laying around but there’s still a lack of dynamism to most environments, despite the generally good graphics (powered by the same engine as Resident Evil 2).Devil May Cry 5 is a triumphal return for the series, with a host of end game secrets that you really shouldn’t wait on someone else to spoil for you. It’s the most approachable and varied any similar game has ever been and yet deep enough to satisfy long-term fans as well. What a few years ago might have been written off as niche franchise, doomed never to return, has reinvented itself as one of the best action games of the generation.In Short: A perfectly judged comeback that’s full of all the wild invention and stylish mayhem fans demand but proves surprisingly accessible and varied for everyone else.Pros: All three characters are great to control and very distinctive, with V being a real revelation. Wide range of difficulty modifiers and additional abilities and moves. Great boss battles.Cons: The camera and lock-on requires a bit too much nannying to keep on top of. Static levels lack dynamism.Score: 9/10

Game Informer,"The Devil May Cry series began with Dante, a lone demon hunter. Today, he’s not so lonely; other playable characters have rotated in over the years, including Vergil, Nero, Trish, and Lady. Devil May Cry 5 expands the cast again with V, a mysterious man who uses demonic companions to fight. V offers a unique approach to DMC’s stylish battles compared to the slash-and-shoot mechanics of Dante and Nero, but his addition comes at a cost: Bouncing among three characters provides fun variety, but it keeps you wading in the shallows of combat too long, rather than letting you dive into its impressive depths.The core appeal of Devil May Cry is stringing moves together to form your own elaborate and spectacular combos. Devil May Cry 5 generally delivers a precise and satisfying (if familiar) version of that formula. You launch underworld abominations into the air, slice them up, and blast them from afar, all using responsive controls that make it easy to cut through the horde. The story is ridiculous and barely coherent, but it works thanks to a few awesome moments I can’t spoil here. All this serves as a consistently entertaining foundation, and all three playable heroes add their own variations.You start playing as Nero, who still uses his sword, gun, and grab to combine mobility and lethality. The biggest change from previous entries comes from his robotic arms. Each arm gives you different powers, like firing off a metal fist to pummel an enemy, super-charging your attacks, or giving you an extra mid-air dash. In theory, this system expands your arsenal with lots of new tricks. In practice, it isn’t fun to manage. Several arms have contextual utility, but you can’t switch among them manually; you have to break (i.e. waste) your limited supply until you get to the one you want. Plus, the arms cost orbs to replenish – the same currency you use to buy your moves and health upgrades – so spending resources on them feels like throwing your money away. Ultimately, they are fun to experiment with, but they aren’t powerful or interesting enough to warrant the hassle and expense.Controlling V offers a departure from tradition, since his approach is all about staying back while directing his demonic allies’ actions and summoning a brute when his Devil Trigger fills. Since his distance from the fray makes him less likely to get hit, I had the easiest time racking up SSS ranks with V. However, executing his companions’ specific moves feels less reliable. Even though using V to plow through fodder enemies is cool, his haphazard style isn’t great for focused encounters, and provides a diminished sense of strategic accomplishment.Dante has some new weapons (like dual rocket launchers) and a twist on his Devil Trigger, but he is the least surprising and most fun of the three heroes. Switching among various styles and weapons feels like the classic DMC I love, and I’m glad Dante’s the one squaring off against DMC 5’s most fearsome foes. That’s not something you can change, since only 2 missions (of 21 total) let you choose your hero; the other 19 are locked in as either Nero, V, or Dante.This assigned-character structure creates a few frustrations. You play as Nero for a bit, and then you switch to V. But V is a blank slate, so you have to start from scratch, often re-buying abilities (like increased speed) that are practically identical to what you’ve already bought for Nero. Then you do the same thing again when Dante unlocks. This gives the pacing a weird, start-and-stop sensation that makes it hard to gain momentum. Once you start to get in the groove with one character, a mandatory swap is always just around the corner.The diffuse gameplay focus also prevents you from accessing the full complexity of each character in a single playthrough. With my time (and orbs) split among three heroes, I felt like I only had the opportunity to climb halfway up the ladder to mastery with any one of them before I finished the final mission. Capcom must have recognized this problem, because the solution appears to be making sure none of the fights require full comprehension of your capabilities – even on Devil Hunter, which is the hardest option available at the start. I’m not saying the game is a total cakewalk, but I was about halfway through my second playthrough (on the next difficulty level up) when I finally hit fights that tested my limits, made me practice techniques, and forced me to improve – something Devil May Cry games normally deliver before the credits roll.However, once you finally reach the depths, Devil May Cry 5 stands shoulder-to-shoulder with its predecessors. Each character has a solid complement of moves and abilities to play with, and some of the more difficult enemy configurations almost feel like puzzles as you prioritize and control the crowd while trying to maximize your rank and keep your health high for the next encounter. I like how the removal of manual-use items (like green and purple stars) prevents you from brute-forcing tough fights, but I also appreciate that you still have gold orbs to let you keep fighting when victory is within sight. All of these wrinkles  (and more surprises I won't ruin) kept me hooked post-game, though I wish the game provided more gameplay-related incentives to keep playing on other than the simple satisfaction of getting better and finishing harder modes.For all of its pacing issues, Devil May Cry 5 is still a lot of fun to play. Combat is a blast, and the cutscenes are delightfully absurd; fans of Devil May Cry 3 and 4 should feel right at home here. Capcom goes back to the baseline action I’ve always enjoyed, and executes that with the series’ signature over-the-top style. However, this entry’s changes and additions to that core experience don’t enhance what the series does well; they feel more like roadblocks than steps forward.

   on November 9, 2020 at 2:31PM PSTEditor's note: This review was originally published in March 2019. Devil May Cry 5 Special Edition, which will soon be available on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, features a number of additions on top of what we've covered here. See our impressions of DMC5 Special Edition on PS5 for more details.As you send demons flying across the screen in Devil May Cry 5, a strong sense of familiarity will hit you. This is ""old school"" Devil May Cry, a simplistic network of hallways and arenas where you humiliate demons with absurd weaponry as a thumping battle theme fuels the bliss of every well-executed combo. DMC5 marks a return to the previous series continuity, and everything you remember about how those games played has been resurrected and improved. It is a brilliant iteration of the series’ best qualities--but it innovates as much as it reiterates, balancing new and old with infectious confidence.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Devil May Cry 5 Quick Video ReviewThe majority of your time in DMC5 is spent killing demons. With an array of melee and projectile attacks, you inflict complex combo strings while performing split-second dodges to evade incoming attacks. An in-game ranking system continually judges your style, encouraging you to better your performance. Protagonists Nero, Dante, and newcomer V each offer their own unique playstyles that makes the simple objective of clearing rooms of enemies continually exhilarating. Combat is where the game most expresses itself, showcasing the nuances of its mechanical depth in a variety of creative ways.Nero is where new and old ideas come together. Replacing his lone Devil Bringer from DMC4 are new prosthetic arms called Devil Breakers. With them, you can pull enemies towards you, as well as tap into an assortment of special abilities depending on which Devil Breaker model you have equipped. For example, Overture can deliver a wide shock attack, while Punch Line shoots a rocket-powered fist that continuously damages enemies. Devil Breakers significantly evolve Nero’s playstyle by expanding his attacks, but what’s most curious is how switching between them requires you to discard your current one in order to equip the next down the line. At first, this seems like an arbitrary way to access each arm’s unique abilities--not to mention there’s little done to justify this rule in-game other than asserting that they’re simply ""fragile.""However, this limitation introduces a thrilling spontaneity to combat that encourages you to be industrious and adaptable. You’re initially compelled to be frugal with Devil Breakers, but as you expand the number you can carry, you start hitting a rhythm expending them with strategic grace, flowing from one stylish combo to the next. But even with the best reflexes, an enemy can shatter a Devil Breaker mid-combo, which forces you to adjust your strategy on the fly. A persistent tension underlies using Nero’s Devil Breakers, melding high-consequence tactics with impulsive creativity. The gratifying free-flowing strategies that Devil Breakers inspire makes it easy to overlook any initial frustrations. They present a brilliant dichotomy that strengthens and amplifies the idiosyncrasies of Nero's more accessible playstyle.Where Nero brings new flair to classic mechanics, V is fresh and unexpected. Unlike his sword-touting brethren, V damages enemies from afar with his two familiars: a shape-shifting panther named Shadow and a demonic bird named Griffon (DMC1 fans should instantly recognize these creatures). The former inflicts melee attacks, while the latter shoots projectiles. Each have their own regenerating health bar and can be taken out of combat temporarily if you're not careful. V also has a third familiar named Nightmare. This giant golem acts as more as a Devil Trigger-like last resort who can inflict ridiculous damage all on his own for a short duration. In addition, it can be commandeered to inflict more direct assaults on enemies. An enemy cannot be killed by a familiar’s attacks alone, though; V himself must inflict the final blow. V requires a patience that goes against your general instinct to be confrontational. As a result, his more deliberate pace can be occasionally irritating, especially when your familiars have trouble focusing on the proper target during a hectic fight. It’s a bit disorienting due to the lack of feedback from hitting enemies with your familiars.Despite this, V’s emphasis on space management and calculated movement is a fantastic change of pace. Cunningly avoiding attacks as you command your familiars to deliver complex juggles is a satisfying thrill. And it's made all the more rewarding by the impact of a final blow alongside V's brief poetic soliloquies. V demands restraint, a quality that defies the offensive strategies of previous characters. His abilities may not seem like much, but he reframes the way DMC is played, demonstrating that there's still room for original and refreshing ideas in combat. V's inventive playstyle is a superb addition that feels right at home alongside Nero and Dante.Old-timer Dante most maintains traditional mechanics, but he’s also where combat is most creative. Like his DMC4 counterpart, he’s able to seamlessly switch between four different fighting styles, each with their own unique maneuvers and setups. This time, though, he can equip up to four weapons and four guns. It’s a joy to perform combos with Dante‘s extensive arsenal; you're capable of rush-stabbing a demon, break-dance-fighting them while they’re down, and then propelling them into the air with a demonic motorcycle chainsaw.While part of the fun is taking in the spectacle of a fight, playing as Dante is really about expressing yourself. There are so many attack combinations available that you can’t help but get sucked into learning the nuances of his every ability to achieve your desired style and flair. DMC historically excels when it’s continually motivating you to not only master its systems, but to execute upon them as elegantly and creatively as possible. Eventually, you get into a kind of flow with Dante, where combat is less about thinking than it is about feeling your way through it. Each character in DMC5 exemplifies this depth and intensity, but it’s with Dante’s open-ended combos where it feels most liberating and rewarding.With an abundance of fighting systems to learn, it helps that you’re gradually weaned into them. The campaign’s pacing is deliberate, starting you with the more accessible Nero, then switching you to strategic spacing of V before opening up combat entirely with Dante. But even as you grow accustomed to how everyone plays, new mechanics are constantly introduced, keeping you thoroughly engaged in the highs of DMC5's stylish combat.There are plenty of foes that test your abilities, too. Bosses in particular offer the most rewarding trials, with different challenges to suit each character's playstyle. For instance, one pushes Dante's ability to maintain quick and effective damage, where another is tailored specifically to V's vulnerability at close-range, forcing you to frequently manage your spacing while keeping your familiars in play. There are a couple bosses tied to relatively anticlimactic set pieces, but these are few and far between. The challenges are kept consistent, supplying riveting duels and new layers of complexity that inspire you to improve. And even with repeated deaths, a lenient continue system keeps the action and drama moving.Speaking of drama, DMC5’s story is an engrossing, albeit predictable, saga with plenty of extravagant action to keep you thoroughly entertained. It has a non-linear structure that has you switching perspectives to get the full picture, which lends variety to the events unfolding before you. Set in the duration of a single day, you're notified of the passing of time at the start of every mission. The narrative benefits from this approach to storytelling, keeping you invested in what each mission has to contribute to your understanding of the timeline.The return to familiar characters is perhaps the story’s most endearing quality. In fact, there are several loving nods to many of the series’ most iconic moments scattered throughout-- a particular instance involving Dante and a hat is a hilarious acknowledgement to the character's history. While some characters, like fan-favorites Trish and Lady, don’t have much to contribute, their presence at least brings a sense of camaraderie. However, a couple of nude scenes involving them come across as tasteless; with so many pleasing callbacks and references, moments like this awkwardly stand out. They feel cheap and unnecessary, hurting Trish and Lady's already minimal characterizations. It stands in stark contrast to the always delightful gunsmith Nico, who's established as headstrong, intelligent, and the reason why Nero is able to make short work of demons in the first place.The story ties a nice bow on the classic continuity’s unanswered questions, allowing for satisfying conclusions for its major protagonists.In spite of its more ambitious scale, DMC5's story leaves room for meaningful character development. It's by no means a nuanced study of its protagonists that digs deep into what makes them tick. But their motivations are always made abundantly clear, making for compelling melodrama whenever they clash against one another. You grow attached to their impassioned, if a bit simplistic, plights--if only to see how they'll overcome the harrowing challenges set before them. Ultimately, the story ties a nice bow on the classic continuity’s unanswered questions, allowing for satisfying conclusions for its major protagonists.There is an effort to pull DMC5's more grandiose moments together on a mechanical level with the Cameo System, which adds a subtle online cooperative element to the formula. Some missions often include the presence of another character exploring a nearby area or even acting alongside you. By default these characters are AI controlled, but through the Cameo System they're controlled either by other players online or their respective ghost data. A cool concept on paper, the feature is largely underutilized with only one particularly exciting instance where you actually get to fight alongside another player. That said, seeing another player from afar does add a novel yet fleeting solidarity to your journey.DMC5 thrives on the stylistic and mechanical prowess of its predecessors. It sticks to tradition above all else, pursuing a few ambitious new ideas along the way, but mostly maintaining the series’ focus on intricate fighting systems and campy bravado. Rarely does the game stumble, consistently leveraging its spectacle and mechanical depth to push aside any small frustrations. All the while, the story exudes a charismatic charm that keeps you constantly intrigued as you’re refining your skills. DMC5 proves the series can still be brilliant and imaginative without compromising its longest-held traditions.Devil May Cry 5 is featured as one of the best PS5 games.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"
Polygon,"Filed under:Even newcomers will find something to enjoy in Devil May Cry 5, if they meet the heavy metal action game on its own termsWhen we first see Nero in Devil May Cry 5, he revs his sword like a motorcycle. That scratches the surface of the game’s mood. Later on, as Dante, I’m able to weaponize literal motorcycles, dragging their spinning wheels across the faces of enemy demons, ripping loose skin and meat. Capcom’s latest entry in the beloved action series is silly, raucous, and spectacular — and yet surprisingly consistent, juggling gobs of ideas but never losing focus.The story of Devil May Cry 5 builds upon its predecessors, with our heroes once again fighting demon lords through a setting that falls somewhere between Dante’s Divine Comedy and a Grim Reaper mural airbrushed onto the side of a 1976 Dodge Tradesman. In this entry, half-demon demon hunter Dante, the demon-handed Nero, and their cast of sidekicks and supporting characters are back to stop (yet) another demon from taking over the Underworld.Devil May Cry 5’s design leans heavily into the rule of cool. That’s a very particular term that acknowledges the shortcomings and flaws of a piece of pop culture, while also excusing them due to everything else about the experience being badass.  Devil May Cry 5’s reliance on the rule of cool is uncompromising, and I found it grating until about halfway through my 15 hours with the game — when I began to see it for what it is, and found a way to meet it on its own terms. I had to embrace its soundtrack’s guitar shrills, its cast of Iggy Pop wannabes, and a comically byzantine combat system.Once I did, I was able to enjoy this heavy metal album cover come to life. Devil May Cry 5 delivers on its own aesthetic with so much confidence and commitment that it justifies itself, and most of its flaws.I’m more or less new to the series, which may explain why it took a moment to find my way aboard this particular cosmic ride. I understand that Nero returns from Devil May Cry 4 and Dante from many previous entries. The rest of the characters are about what I expected from the series, based on limited time with previous entries. There’s the mysterious and mopey V, with his cane, book of poetry, and wisecracking demon-bird familiar. Nico is the scantily clad, chain-smoking gunsmith who careens around the city in the Devil May Cry mobile office van. As in previous games, Devil May Cry 5 rates my performance not by the number of enemies I kill in each fight, but by how stylishly I’m able to slaughter them. I earn a rating of “dismal” when I flail around and don’t take advantage of my powers. I earn “apocalyptic” after I learn how to time my attacks properly and use more of the moves at my disposal. To earn the coveted S rank, I must kill with my weapon and slay with my style.I fought against this approach for hours, because I kept forgetting that nothing is more important than being cool. To a newcomer, Devil May Cry 5 plays like an over-the-shoulder hack-and-slash game, and that’s how I kept trying to play it. I’d mash buttons when I entered unfamiliar territory. That got me through fights in Devil May Cry 5 well enough, but it didn’t take my low ratings during each battle to show me that I was missing the point. I was playing the game but not getting it. I’m limited by the closed-off arenas of each fight. It’s intentionally of an era gone by, resulting in a pace that, today, feels uneven and jerky. A cutscene is followed by an empty hallway that leads me to another cutscene. I roll my eyes at the flood of new weapons and new moves, and the boss fights in which the enemy is never quite dead enough that fill the game’s third act. But then I take a step back and realize that a game with motorcycle swords isn’t focusing on its own narrative structure. Because who has time for structure when you have motorcycle swords? The fun isn’t in answering why you have swords, but in taking the time to make the absolute most of them.And that’s when it clicks. I’m suddenly 14 years old with $5 in quarters in my pocket, pumping coins into the loudest, flashiest cabinet in the arcade. I stop tripping over the fights and pacing. I’m only given a small space for each fight, but that allows me to focus on each scrimmage as if it were a theatrical space: my weapon my instrument, each hit a note. Hallways and cutscenes provide quiet momentS before I’m asked to build another crescendo of sticky violence. I’m given new weapons and moves not merely because they are more powerful, but because they provide variety that will add greater depth to my show. I start to think of the game itself as an observer for my actions, and I want to make sure it’s having a good time watching how I use the tools I’m given to kick ass in entertaining ways. I want a good rating on this fight, at this moment, more than I want to see what happens next.But buying into the rule of cool doesn’t mean I’m able to ignore all the ways the game stumbles. Devil May Cry 5 is built on the series’ impenetrable lore, which lies in the uncomfortable space between baffling and inconsequential. I control a trio of brooding men while largely objectified women sit on the sidelines. I navigate plot twists that don’t mean anything to me unless I dig through fan wikis. The default control scheme also frustrated me during the game’s early hours, and I spent too much time fighting the tricky button combinations and earning dismal ratings during battles before I realized I should just take the time to remap the buttons. Once I did get comfortable with the controls and spent some time learning the moves, the fights became almost too easy. Low-level enemies dropped dead before I got a chance to do anything cool, and more difficult enemies barely touched me. I suppose difficulty isn’t the point, since I’m only worried about style. Now, as I work through harder difficulty settings, I find that enough practice and a focus on stylistic combos make most fights quick. The enemies are more like a halfpipe I can use to try cool tricks, rather than a threat that can take me out if I’m not paying attention. And here I find myself, once again, learning to meet the game on its own terms.Devil May Cry 5 is truly, madly, deeply itself. I can’t think of any other game in which I can slice through flying demons while my panther familiar transforms into a spinning wheel of bladed death as metal guitar licks screech across rain-soaked streets. I’m not interested in perfection in that situation; I’m interested in fun. And Devil May Cry 5 is fun. It’s all about huge swords, epic fights, and ridiculous characters. Nothing about the game is subtle. It doesn’t have to be. It’s a gory, metalcore-driven, imperfect romp. It didn’t ask me for much — just 15 hours of my time and a willingness to admit that, all right, dragging a motorcycle across a demon’s face is, in fact, pretty badass. Devil May Cry 5 will be released March 8 on PlayStation 4, Windows PC, and Xbox One. The game was reviewed on Xbox One using a final “retail” download code provided by Capcom.

Kotaku,"Devil May Cry 5 is a wild mess of demonic magic, blood, brooding twinks, butt rock music, kung-fu homage, and joyous gameplay. By the end of it, I had killed literally thousands of demons and watched struggles of Biblical proportions. The experience itself is a blur, but I know two things for certain. The first is that while there’s nary a drop of romance in the game, every one of Devil May Cry 5’s sexy trash protagonists has absolutely fucked. The second is that every bone-splintering, blood-splattering moment I spent with them was a goddamn blast.This piece was first published on March 6, 2019. We’re bumping it today for the game’s release.Set after Devil May Cry 4, Devil May Cry 5’s story focuses on a massive demonic invasion led by a nasty-looking demon king named Urizen. Guided by series newcomer V, legendary demon hunter Dante and his erstwhile bud Nero square off against Urizen, only to face an astounding defeat at the start of the game. Nero survives, while Dante goes missing. Some time later, Nero embarks on a journey to set right was went wrong and save the world. The journey takes him through a monster-ravaged city and up to the top of a massive demonic tree. Each step forward involves a lot of hacking and slashing of bug creatures and shadow beasts.There is an initial learning curve as the player is introduced to all of the violent options at their disposal. Players can slash enemies to bits, blow them up with rocket launchers, and capoeira kick demons silly.  Once you get the hang of it, though, Devil May Cry 5 builds into the stylish carnage that the series is famous for. The joy of a character action game, be it Devil May Cry, Metal Gear Rising, or Bayonetta, is learning how to make hacking and head-stomping as graceful as a dance. Devil May Cry 5 is a subtle waltz where missing a button press by even a half-beat can have dire consequences. The allure of Devil May Cry isn’t simply the chance to play as a deadly demon hunter; it’s a chance to feel completely in control of your body. Devil May Cry 5 delivers even more by letting its protagonists’ personalities shine through in combat. When I play as these characters, I understand exactly the type of people they are.Nero is angry. Not simply in that tough-guy, video game protagonist sort of way—he’s pissed off. Brushed off as “dead weight” by Dante during their ill-fated fight and reeling from the tragic loss of his right arm months before the game’s start, Nero has a lot to prove. Playing as Nero means channelling his frustration and loss into combat against any demon who wanders into your path. Nero’s sword can be revved like a motorcycle throttle to build up energy before attacking or to give your strikes some extra pop, Gunblade style. He also comes equipped with a variety of prosthetic arms crafted by the nerdy mechanic Nico, a new character to the series. The most basic of these releases a powerful lightning blast, but others have more dramatic effects. You find arms that let you slam enemies around like a pro-wrestler, charge up to release energy beams, propel you through the air, and fire off rocket fists that attack enemies on their own. If you want to kick ass as Nero, you need to lean into every one of these tricks. Here’s how a fight might go:Rush in with a lunging stab, slash and then pause a half second before slashing again to trigger a furious series of overhead strikes. Do a rising slash to launch an enemy into the air, pull yourself to them with your grappling arm, punch them with your rocket fist, shoot them with your revolver to air juggle them, call your rocket arm back to you and ride that shit like a hoverboard. Glide that fist right into a demon’s throat and trigger an explosion. Leap away, dash to the next monster. Repeat until the room is full of bug meat and blood smears. Pause the game and smoke a cigarette because you’re a sexy bitch. If you’re a sexy enough bitch, Devil May Cry 5 will let you know. Like previous series’ entries, each moment of gameplay is accompanied by a letter ranking to let you know what degree of badass you are. It starts at D for “dismal” and builds to the wonderful SSS rating for “Smokin’ Sexy Style!” Variety is the spice of life, according to Devil May Cry 5: The more you kill and the more you switch up how you’re killing, the more your rank increases. This means that the initial portions of the game can feel limiting, as you barely have access to the various sword combos, special moves, and tricky dodge skills necessary to earn those higher ranks. It can be frustrating at first, but as you play and earn orbs to purchase new abilities, the game world transforms from a paint-by-numbers kiddy book to a blank canvas where you are the master. As your rank increases, the game’s musical theme, “Devil Trigger,” begins to play. “Devil Trigger” is not a good song, but God help me if I don’t lose my shit every time I nail a combo and hear its gnashing butt rock wailings punctuate my carnage. Nero is not the only character at your disposal. Much of the early game is spent playing as the mysterious newcomer V, whose frail body leaves him dependent on a swarm of animal familiars to deal with enemies until he can strike a finishing blow. Where Nero is angry and furious, V is slow and deliberate. In a series where aggression is everything, V flips that dynamic upside down.Playing as V sometimes feels more like navigating a map of Into the Breach or fitting a Tetris block into the right place than it does Devil May Cry. Because he’s so fragile and slow in combat, positioning is incredibly important. If I’m playing as Nero, I know exactly where I need to be: right in a demon’s stupid face. As V, that’s more complicated. Combat as V is a combination of dashing and floating into the right position and then summoning the correct minion to punish greedy enemies. Not only does this help communicate something about V as a character—he is distant, reserved, and calculating—but it also brings variety to Devil May Cry 5’s missions. A wild stretch as Nero ebbs into a slower, counter-attack focused exhibition whenever you play as V. Both are equally satisfying, and both force you to think about enemy monsters in different lights. In rare cases, some missions give you the choice of playing as Nero or V. Not only does this offer replayability, but their diverging paths round out the gameplay experience.It wouldn’t be a Devil May Cry game without Dante, and Devil May Cry 5 delivers the most freewheeling version of him to date. Dante has picked up dozens of weapons and fighting styles throughout years of demon slaying. Instead of forcing players to relearn his abilities or contriving some video-gamey scenario where Dante needs to regain his lost power, Devil May Cry 5 gives you access to everything immediately. To quote my coworker Tim Rogers, Dante is “a whole buffet table which happens to have some macaroni and cheese.” Not only does he have access to his signature sword and pistols, he also has gauntlets for kung-fu punching and a motorcycle to crash into enemies. He unlocks even more weapons throughout the story, such as transforming nunchaku and a cowboy hat that can be used as a projectile. All of these weapons can be augmented with one of four stances—Trickster, Gunslinger, Swordmaster, and Royal Guard. Each style gives weapons a different effect, and you’re able to mix a match all of the tools on the fly. It’s wild, stylish, and deliciously excessive.""Jackpot!""Monster MashFantastic combat, stylish cutscenes, each playable character feels unique. Also: it's just fuckin' fun.Story doesn't really take off until the very end, some generic environments in the middle segments.CapcomXbox One (played), Playstation 4, PCMarch 8Completed on normal difficulty in around 14 hours. Repeated a lot of levels to get higher ranks.Tons of melee weapons and guns, all augmented depending on your stance, might sound overwhelming. If I want to turn my magic nunchucks into a Sun Wukong staff, I need to remember to be in Swordmaster. If I want to counter enemies I need to time a block perfectly in Royal Guard. Oh shit, that demon is running right at me. What do I do? But let me tell you a  secret: I played a fair portion of this game buzzed on wine and still managed to get mostly S ranks during missions, at least on the default difficulty. Because for all of the complexity of Devil May Cry 5’s combat, the gameplay is incredibly intuitive. After a little bit of practice and a few mistakes, you start to find what works for you. In my case, that meant falling back on Swordmaster’s ability to unlock new forms and attacks for my favorite weapons while swapping my arsenal around just enough to build up my score. Nero and V have their own particularities, but Dante’s status as Master of Everything means that you’re bound to find a play-style that turns demons into hamburger. Since Devil May Cry 5 makes swapping weapons and styles as easy as a quick button tap, you’ll start to dash around the screen like you were born for this.  The core of Devil May Cry 5 is style over substance, fake it until you make it. Get your high scores, and if you mess up, just load the level again until you get those sweet S ranks.Combat is intuitive, and the characters are clearly defined, but the surrounding pieces that make the experience stumble, if only slightly. The core gameplay is wonderful, but it’s in service of a plot that is fractured and honestly makes little sense, even to a fan of the series like me.Much of this has to do with how poorly some things are communicated. At least one major character reveal was undersold so much that I didn’t even realize what had happened until I read about it again at a loading screen. The core concept is strong: Dante and the gang lost, and now it’s time to pick up the pieces. Character motivations are clear, but there’s not a lot of time spent on really understanding their relationships with each other. Key series characters like Trish and Lady are essentially left in the wings while the protagonists battle a generic demon villain with little charisma. Things finally come to a head near the end, but the process is so rushed that even the most elaborate and badass moments of fan-service land clumsily. Everything is stylish enough in the moment that I was enthralled. It’s only looking back that I realized that not a whole lot had happened in terms of raw plot or valuable character growth.It’s tempting to say that the Devil May Cry series doesn’t need too much plot or interpersonal struggle. To an extent, that’s true. Even with this flaw, Devil May Cry 5 is an amazing ride. But games like Devil May Cry 3 and even the much maligned Ninja Theory reboot DmC: Devil May Cry found time to build out their worlds and bring richness to their characters. In the former, the baroque setting became a stage for a pseudo-Shakespearean tale of clashing siblings and patricide. In the latter, a They Live inspired aesthetic mocking cable news networks turned Dante into a sort of counter-cultural icon. Devil May Cry 5 takes bits and pieces from these games, crafting a setting that’s alternatively neon-lit and steeped in blood, but for all of the flash there’s not as much going on with its characters as I’d like until the final moments, even if the actors sell the shit out of the proceedings throughout.Devil May Cry 5 is a firework. If you’re the one with the lighter, then setting the explosion off is as simple as flicking your finger. If you’re watching someone else, it’s more than enough to enjoy the bright colors and noise. Players looking to get dazzled will find themselves spellbound, while those who dig deeper will find a rewarding and expressive combat system. It’s a little superficial, but that comes with the territory. And while Devil May Cry 5 doesn’t completely redefine the series, it hones the gameplay to a sharp edge that will please diehards and newbies alike."
USgamer,"Stylish action games are all about lightning-fast combat. It’s a genre where your moveset is so broad that it only reveals its true depth over multiple playthroughs. Devil May Cry 5 is one of the most technical yet. Rather than having just one character to master, here we have three. Newcomer V is weak and attacks with spectral animals called familiars. The twist is that V has to personally finish each enemy off, meaning he must get in and out of range constantly - he’s only effective when an enemy is staggered. Those familiars - which are partly controlled by AI - can be knocked out of action temporarily, too, causing the grotesque hordes to focus on you. You have to constantly keep V out of danger: a horizontal dodge causes you to skate along the ground with your panther familiar, Shadow; while dodging backwards summons your bird, Griffon, to fly you to safety. Not only does the timing of these affect V, but they cause your familiars to disengage. Knowing when to pull them out is key. V is all about spatial awareness, keeping an eye on health meters, enemy locations, spotting clusters for area of effect opportunities, and charging up your Devil Trigger gauge by reading poetry (yes). Get the gauge to at least three bars and you can summon Nightmare, a colossal familiar that bursts through scenery and autonomously fills the scene with explosions and laserbeams. Conjuring this massive creature instantly revives Griffon and Shadow, so timing is paramount.  
 
Though he’s the most complicated on paper (you’re essentially controlling three things at once), V feels built for newcomers. There’s some nuance in how you can charge up one familiar while moving out of danger and hammering attack with another, but he’s the easiest character to parse. Racking up those SSS ranks is a doddle - especially when you learn to chain together finishers, teleporting between enemies and driving your magical cane into their hides. The moody newcomer is fun to play for a while, but his lack of depth makes him the weakest of the roster. His familiars can also be a little frustrating, since you never have full control over their range and they don’t always do what you intend. Things are much better when it comes to Nero. The cocky youngster's moveset seems simple on the surface - one button swings your sword, another fires your gun, and another uses your Devil Breaker: prosthetic arms with varied abilities - but he’s more complex than it appears. You can hold buttons to charge up gunshots, launch enemies into the air, pause between hits to twist into a different combo, rev your sword to Exceed and unlock a fiery new moveset, and pull enemies towards you with a locked-on grab. But it’s in those Devil Breakers where Nero comes into his own. You equip a set of these prosthetics before each battle. There’s a Breaker that grabs and pummels enemies, one blasts out an electric charge, another burrows into demon flesh, one has a rocket-powered punch (which you can also ride), one fires out kinetic blasts, launching you through the air, and there’s another that fires out multiple whips, lashing enemies all around you. Each has its own purpose and ideal scenario for deployment. They also all have a charged technique that overclocks and breaks them once triggered. If you’re hit while a Breaker is active, it breaks, forcing you to equip the next. You can also manually break them to send out a powerful blast, damaging enemies around you - this also works to escape from otherwise unblockable attacks.  
 
The only way to get to the next arm in your inventory is to purposely (or accidentally) break the one you’re using. The idea is that Nero’s moveset constantly evolves as you play. When you want to switch, you have to sacrifice and commit. I can see high level players having a lot of fun with locking down the perfect Devil Breaker setups for each level, knowing exactly when to switch during each encounter. There’s a boss fight early on against a huge demon with a gaping mouth for a belly. In my first playthrough, I barely scrape through. In my second playthrough - on the more difficult Son of Sparda setting - I stagger him by exploding my Devil Breaker, then use the Buster Arm to pick him up by his tail and spin him around, launching him across the arena. It’s hard not to have Nero’s shit-eating grin plastered over your face when you’re lobbing a ten foot demon like a trash bag. Most games become less interesting as you replay them, but DMC 5 only gets better. It wasn’t until my third playthrough that I started really getting the hang of jump cancels, a high-level technique that allows you to stay in the air indefinitely. This is triggered by using a move called Enemy Step to interrupt any animation in the air. It’s one of the best ways to rack up an SSS rank combo, and there’s little more satisfying than picking off enemies by pulling them up into the air one at a time as their friends flail at nothing on the ground below. Some hardcore fans have been bemoaning the lack of ‘inertia’ - an unintended mechanic that allowed for more aerial showboating, a side-effect of DMC 4’s physics - but who cares when you can flow from a jump cancel straight into a rocket ride and back again? Despite the nuances of these two characters, though, it’s no accident that the game gives you control of series staple Dante last. The demon hunter is like a Swiss army knife where every attachment is secretly another, smaller Swiss army knife. He’s more versatile than duct tape. He has four fighting styles, and by the end of the game has four melee weapons and four ranged weapons. All of the weapons interact with the styles, and you can switch between styles and weapons with the tap of a button. To complicate things further, some of the weapons have multiple forms.  
 
Take the Balrog, Dante’s demonic gauntlets: pulling back on the left stick and pressing attack at the same time switches it between Kick Mode and Blow Mode, allowing him to flow from capoeira-style kicks to boxer-style punches in an instant. Hitting Circle while in the Swordmaster fighting style deploys a different move depending on whether you’re punching or kicking. You can also hold attack while in Blow Mode to trigger the Welter Move, allowing you to bob and weave, following up with powerful body hooks and uppercuts like a demonic Mike Tyson. While Dante is just as devastating in the air as Nero, he offers plenty of reasons for you to stay on the ground as well. Pair Welter Move with Trickster - a fighting style for swift escapes - and you can dodge, weave, and zip around the arena like a kid at a soft play centre. Use it with Royalguard and you can make up for mistimed dodges with blocks and counter attacks. Whatever firearm you have equipped is layered over this, as well as the ability to switch to Gunslinger to alter the abilities of your ranged attacks. Oh, and you can turn into two different demon forms based on two separate power gauges, with one charging the other. It’s ridiculous, but it somehow remains intuitive and never feels overwhelming. Capcom is a master of the genre it spawned. There’s an element of learning combos and button inputs, but that’s not really the focus - DMC 5 is about making split-second decisions constantly, reacting on the fly to breakneck encounters. None of the moves are over-complicated - the complexity comes from knowing how to stitch them together effectively. Techniques are often a case of pausing attack strings or flicking the stick at the right time. When you’re focused, it’s like you’re being controlled by some unseeable puppeteer. It’s intoxicating. It looks incredible in motion, too. Even with the online components that see other players fighting in the distance at parallel points in the story, the action doesn’t slow down. It’s as slick and smooth as a stylish action game should be. The animations sell it even more, from the way Dante and Nero slide across the floor to turn on a dime, to how V strokes the orbs of his downed familiars if you stand closeby.  
 
The only thing that lets down the presentation are the environments. Everything looks sharp - this is the RE Engine, after all - but the environments are dull. Broken city streets soon make way to dank sewers, and most of the second half of the game is spent roaming the identical corridors and hexagonal arenas of a demonic nest. Some of the secret missions, unlocked by lining up symbols in the scenery, are just as unimaginative. Collect all the red orbs in a library? No thanks, I’d rather be battering demons with this nunchaku that turns into a lightning staff. Likewise, the story doesn’t go anywhere interesting. It’s pure fan service. The series’ returning women - Trish and Lady - play simple bit parts (and also show you their bits and parts). They’re around for the beginning of the game, they disappear for story reasons, then turn up again later - completely naked - for other story reasons. Lady’s real name is Mary, but the moniker Dante bestowed on her is fitting here: she doesn’t really have a personality, she’s just a woman for boys to ogle. Same for Trish, a demon warrior reduced to flesh. It’s a dated depiction of women characters and doesn’t do justice to these previously playable badasses at all. By playthrough two, though, you’ll be skipping the cutscenes to get to the good stuff: that action. Like previous DMC games, this is designed to be played through multiple times. Difficulty in games is often wielded like a badge of honour. In DMC, it’s baked into the design. Whatever difficulty you start on (Devil Hunter here), you keep all your upgrades for the next playthrough. So while the enemies get more difficult, your characters grow stronger in tandem. 
 
Son of Sparda mode, unlocked at completion, is not just about giving enemies more health and letting them hit harder. Instead, it changes up the mix of enemies, throwing different variations at you earlier on and keeping you on your toes. Increasing the challenge really lets you see what you've learned and it keeps the combat interesting through subsequent runs. Though it’s not without its flaws, DMC 5 is a game where action is king. A layperson might think God of War and DMC 5 exist in the same genre, but they don’t. DMC 5 isn’t about going on an epic journey, meeting characters, and uncovering the mysteries of a world. It’s about riding a fucking rocket, flying it between enemies, flipping over a demon and shooting it in the head. It’s about pulling up your hood, taunting the hordes of Hell, and somersaulting sideways at the last second before launching into a flurry of sword strikes. It’s about murdering ten demons without your feet ever touching the ground. It’s about fighting and looking cool while you do it. In that, it’s an unparalleled success. Version tested: PlayStation 4.

DEVIL MAY CRY 5 isn’t hiding how much it wants you back. The unwarranted catastrophe surrounding DmC Devil May Cry pushed Capcom to stop trying to reinvent its stagnating franchise and continue down the path it was already going down. Change-averse fans demanded an “out with the new, in with the old” approach and Capcom obliged with Devil May Cry 5. While the game does stick too closely to its aging roots and doesn’t push forward as much as it should, it still has a solid enough base in most regards to maintain a decent portion of its signature glory.Fast-paced combat made Devil May Cry what it is and it appropriately takes center stage in Devil May Cry 5. Responsive controls ensure that sliding around and slashing about is inherently satisfying; a feat that is carried by its rock-solid framerate. Each Devil May Cry game’s enemy design, boss fights, and array of weapons or mechanics benefit from that framework and their collective merit is what separates the best installments games from the not so good ones. And while that can mostly be summed up easily in those past entries, Devil May Cry 5’s three different characters vary drastically in quality and make that judgment a bit more difficult than it has been in the past.V is the newest addition to the Devil May Cry pantheon and, frankly, the weakest of the whole lot. He only strikes his opponents to land the finishing blow and relies upon his demonic panther, bird, and monster to do his attacking for him, which is unlike anything else in the genre. Novelty, however, can’t make up for how distant and unsatisfying he is to play most of the time.Commanding forces lacks the tactile feeling of attacking someone for yourself, which is a key part of any good hack and slash game. The projections also don’t always instantly obey your commands, further separating you from the action you already take a backseat to. Hanging back and sending orders means attacks can easily whiff since your lackeys will have a hard time judging if they should zoom in to the enemy you’re locked on to or pummel the bush 10 feet in from of it. V’s gameplay almost plays out like a real-time strategy game yet that approach doesn’t channel what Devil May Cry is good at and it shows.Precision has always defined Devil May Cry and V just doesn’t stack up. The game oddly doesn’t punish brainless play as evidenced by how effective button mashing is, even on the harder Son of Sparta difficulty. It struggles to effectively stop the player from exploiting thoughtless methods as randomly and continually attacking charitably hands out S ranks and destroys most bosses. He lacks nuance yet the game almost never demands it from him; a failure on two fronts. It’s not outright bad as it skates by on the core fluidity of the base controls, creative attack animations, and one-on-one boss fights but its mindlessness goes against everything Devil May Cry stands for.Nero’s mechanics are more in line with what Devil May Cry is about and, more specifically, Devil May Cry 4. Many of his attack strings carry over unabated, giving him a comparable, gratifying gameplay loop that is admittedly a bit sparse when compared to Dante’s arsenal. However, a few late-game upgrades and slightly bigger ability pool improve his overall playability this time around despite still being limited by just a single sword and gun.His new Devil Breaker arms are supposed to be the most substantial new addition. Instead of just grabbing enemies with a demonic hand, there are multiple different hands each with a unique standard and ultimate attack. For example, there’s one that stops time in a small area normally and stops time everywhere when charged up. But what the multiple Devil Breakers have in variety is almost overwritten by a few puzzling design decisions.Devil Breakers are, well, breakable and will shatter when you take damage, use its ultimate attack, or detonate it to push back enemies. Most of their strategic functions get undercut by how limited they are and how you can’t easily switch between them. Burning any arm on low-level enemies is a tough proposition since you either have to buy or find replacements. Scarcity like this discourages experimentation; a feeling that runs counter to the strengths of the genre.And you can’t switch between the arms in your loadout which is limiting given the endless possibilities swapping Devil Breakers mid-combo would have. Placing broken arms on cooldown timers and letting players change between them on the fly would help the Devil Breaker mechanic reach its full capability. The current system is solid on the surface but it only shows tantalizing glimpses of what it could have been.Dante is the only character that fulfills his potential and is unsurprisingly the best part of Devil May Cry 5. While he originally appears to a disappointing carbon copy of his Devil May Cry 4 appearance, the game piles an incredible amount of weapons and moves on the red-coated smartass. Dante’s impressive melee and ranged arsenal combines with his multiple returning styles to give him an overwhelming amount of options.There’s a lot to unpack and the well-paced drip of new toys makes combat an ever-evolving onion that opens up the more you peel back. Each weapon is independently viable thanks to their expansive movesets and overall fluidity. But the game’s freeform approach to combat begs for players to think of clever ways to combine each and create some legendary, rewarding combos. It appropriately takes a lot of practice and dexterity to perform lengthy, uninterrupted juggles, but the game allows you that freedom and the snappy controls to achieve such a status.Dante, V, and Nero all benefit from the game’s incredible replayability. Even though it can cause the early levels to feel like a bit of a slog, the number of purchasable upgrades and new moves come out at a steady enough clip to always give players something to strive for. And the game has enough upgrades to dole out over multiple playthroughs, which is perfect for its approach to difficulty.While the normal setting isn’t nearly as hard as its predecessors, the tougher modes get a bit more challenging as stronger enemies appear earlier on and more resilient bosses execute new patterns. Remixing the core content like this livens up the game since it gives players a new look on what is essentially the same experience. And this steady increase in difficulty is set up in a way to train players for the punishment that lies in the game’s extreme modes that hack and slash games are often judged by. Devil May Cry 5 not only has the responsive mechanics to survive under that duress, but it also is paced cleverly enough to prepare players for those trials if they put in the effort.Even though the replayability represents Devil May Cry at its peak, it still doesn’t overwrite how safe is and how little it has learned from other games as well as its underappreciated reboot. Most environments are flat, cliché locales that fail to match the liveliness or ingenuity of DmC’s memorable stages. Grabbing enemies doesn’t cover as much distance as it should nor does it allow you to pull yourself to your enemies. Aside from the moves in Dante’s Trickster style, dodging isn’t just one button and air dashing is still frustratingly not an option. Platforming is also still an afterthought and most bosses, while exhilarating, don’t tie into the narrative and are random beasts you kill just for the sake of it.While DmC was melodramatically crucified for its take on the series, it did improve the franchise’s aging formula in a few ways that the subsequent entries should have incorporated going forward. Devil May Cry 4’s aging foundation was the reason Capcom handed it off in the first place and to completely ignore DmC’s advancements is as petty as it is unwise. Instead of being a healthy mix of the two, Devil May Cry 5 has chosen to spitefully walk the path of its numbered entries with few modernizations in fear of poking the beehive once again.Its narrative also appears as though it was partially constructed with this timid development plan but that’s not the biggest of its problems. The game abruptly begins and it takes a bit to explain itself, but it turns out that a demon named Urizen is trying to harvest blood through the hellish Qliphoth tree to produce a fruit that yields incredible power to the being that eats it. V, Dante, and Nero take it upon themselves to power up and stop this seemingly unstoppable force.It’s told out of chronological order but easy to follow thanks to the helpful timeline on the loading screens. However, that doesn’t always make it enjoyable to follow as almost every single character is an annoying chud that clogs up every scene with a barrage of unfunny quips. Nero’s newfound snark is a pale imitation of Dante and their merchant, Nico, repeatedly forces horrible jokes in almost every line.V is cringe personified as his regular poetry slams are edgelord nonsense delivered in the most insufferable tone. Griffon, V’s bird, also has a ton of repetitive barks and awful one-liners that sound like a bad impression of Nolan North trying to do an even worse impression of Gilbert Gottfried. Dante is still the same wise ass but, since it is his schtick, he gets away with it. The incredible and simply stunning character animation makes each mesmerizing to watch but no amount of great animation can make most of the cast more tolerable.Even though its plot twists are incredibly obvious because of how overtly the game drops hints, those later revelations make up the game’s best narrative bits. It does borrow some of the conflicts from the past installments but they are just different enough to avoid being a direct copy.But there are bigger issues with the storytelling as a whole. Rather than dish out a narrative evenly throughout each level like DmC, stages are just plot-free strings of arenas with a couple of cutscenes at the bookends. By returning that poorly paced formula, it shows how little Capcom learned from Ninja Theory’s storytelling expertise.Learning little from DmC might be all some disgruntled fans need to hear because the insufferable backlash to that reboot is what has shaped Devil May Cry 5 into what it is. Whether willing or not, it pressured Capcom into reverting back into its old habits and creating a more direct sequel to Devil May Cry 4. While this means it has archaic narrative habits, lifeless level design, and missing features, it also means the game has excellent combat, extraordinary replay value, spectacular boss fights, and one of the best versions of Dante to date. Its reluctance to properly evolve keep it from being the king of its genre, but its commitment to its stylish and responsive mechanics still makes it one of the best hack and slash games, crown or not.GameRevolution reviewed Devil May Cry 5 on Xbox One with a copy provided by the publisher.8Michael Leri is Evolve's senior gaming editor.

Destructoid,"darkI’ll never forget a conversation one of our readers had with someone who was down on Devil May Cry 5 after the reveal. Their response to another community member who felt burned by DmC: “Mate, there’s a giant monster eating cars with his chest in the trailer, the game is going to be fine.”How right they were.Devil May Cry 5 (PC, PS4, Xbox One [reviewed on an Xbox One X]) Developer: Capcom Publisher: Capcom Released: March 8, 2019 MSRP: $59.99Devil May Cry 3 is still the gold standard for action games and I’ll take a moment to tell you why.Coming off the ill-fated Devil May Cry 2 and saddled with directorial duties after the original seat was jettisoned, Hideaki Itsuno had something to prove. He went all-out for the third entry, packing in so many different concepts that it was almost overwhelming yet ultimately satisfying once you figured them all out. The pacing was succinct, the prequel conceit allowed the team to play around with previously conceived notions of the series, and at launch, it was one of the most challenging action games ever released (it was later revealed that originally in the West, the default difficulty setting of “normal” was actually Japan’s “hard”). It was the perfect storm for an action entry that in my mind, has only been approached by the Bayonetta series.DMC3 was seemingly the apex of action and Itsuno couldn’t top it with his next effort. Although Devil May Cry 4 was on point mechanically, knocking it out of the park with two different characters, it suffered from an uneven campaign with tons of backtracking. Devil May Cry 5 feels like a genuine response to those complaints alongside a sprinkling of the secret sauce that made the third entry so great, topped with a hearty helping of original work. Even the menu sounds at the very start (like the “boom…Devil May Cry” voiceover) help set the tone.A tone, mind, that’s familiar, but welcome: a demonic force is terrorizing the world and a group of demon hunters needs to stop it. It’s straightforward and basically serves as a device to thrust the entire gang (Dante, Nero, Trish, Lady, plus newcomers Nico and V) into the spotlight to take down a big bad. With trademark comedic elements and absurd style baked-in it feels authentic, like you’re along for the ride. Devil May Cry 5 is just as over-the-top as the series has always been without taking itself too seriously: it’s the most obvious virtue that’s been put by the wayside in the past. New players shouldn’t feel lost, either. Not only are the four preceding core stories relatively easy to explain, but there’s also a text-crawl “history of the series” movie to watch from the main menu. Let me be clear though: if you’re expecting anything mind-blowing or genre-defining, you might not need to get on this train. This is an old school-minded Bayonetta-esque action romp that doesn’t pretend to be anything more.Your chief tritagonist is Nero from Devil May Cry 4 with some newly minted gimmicks. In lieu of his now-missing arm he can utilize “Devil Breakers,” clever transitory junker items that are so fragile, they’ll break on a moment’s notice. They’re so cheaply made that they’ll disintegrate if you use their ultimate power, use them to break away from an enemy combo or grab, or get hit once while wielding their power (Punch Line, a rocket fist that kind of flies around and does its own thing, is my favorite). To make up for the fact that you’ll be arm-free after they’ve all been ground into dust, Nero also sports a pulley system for grabbing smaller enemies or propelling himself closer to big ones.All of these abilities do a better job of keeping players in the fight than his Devil May Cry 4 kit. Nero really came into his own after I slammed an enemy into a wall then quickly grappled them back and drilled them into the ground. Where I started to click with Nero is when I realized that his Devil Breakers are completely expendable. There’s no point in holding onto them once you’ve mastered dodging: just keep the sparks flying. Nero’s enhanced focus feels more justified this time around.Then there’s the Adam Driver-ass V. He might look like a total dullard, but his wisecracking talking bird rules and so does his whole combat vibe. His whole thing is that his minions (a ranged bird, a melee panther, and a giant behemoth governed by his super meter) beat up enemies for him then he finishes them off with his magical cane. I dig it! You can control your creatures while doing other actions with V, like initiating a more pronounced shadow dodge or reading poetry (seriously) to recharge his super (Devil Trigger) gauge.That same gauge can power-up minions in an “EX” fashion if a certain strategy is favorable, which allows you to manually adapt as you survey the battleground as a commander of sorts. His summons have combos and multi-directional abilities, so you aren’t just spamming them or letting them fight. There’s nothing like surfing a dark nimbus cloud to get around while you’re independently operating your minion bird to shoot projectiles.As for Dante, all four of his styles (the speed-oriented Trickster, melee-centric Swordsman, ranged Gunslinger, and defense-minded Royal Guard) return and are hot-swappable, but this time with new weapons in tow. Cavaliere, the motorbike found in nearly all of the trailers, is actually a set of twin chainsaw blades: combined with the Swordsman style, he can ride it into the fray and grind up enemies. Another, a cowboy-themed power which I won’t spoil here, is one of the most unique in the Devil May Cry universe. From a series that once conceptualized Pandora’s Box as a briefcase full of endless weapons, the weaponry is right on the money.Dante’s styles really are the focus though because once again the swap technique works flawlessly. One moment you might be twirling around shotguns to keep away a mob, then swap to swordsman to isolate a big threat, then in half a second throttle to Royal Guard to perfectly parry an attack, throw back the force of the blow, then use Trickster to dart away and flow back into combat with a teleport.V and Dante (which have their own skill trees) were game-changers for me in the sense that they took Devil May Cry 5 to the next level, marrying new and old-school trains of thought respectively. All of this is present while trying to master Devil May Cry‘s combo system (which goes all the way up to SSS-Stylish, unlocking more intense music as you go), a kind of minigame on top of mere survival. This is a series that boasts a taunt button simply for boosting your score: not something you see often. The stylish focus is partly why Devil May Cry is still relevant.Enemy variety quickly gets spicy. At first you’ll do battle with some nasty bugs, then duel with grim reapers with thorny crowns then hooded dual-cleaver berserkers. Bosses are memorable and formidable, and several are seared in my memory with the best of them. Devil May Cry 5‘s environments are equally impressive and the RE Engine serves the series well. In some cases floors can fall out, leading to new zones, and there’s some really expansive areas where you can see battles going on in the background. It’s the kind of game that makes a commanding use of its photo mode.Backtracking from DMC4 is eschewed in favor of different perspectives for several levels, which are thankfully optional for completion (read: stages where you can choose a character only need to be beaten once, which is rad). Load times are relatively short and pacing is on point from minute one. There isn’t a lot of boring exposition and pretty much everyone gets their ass kicked by the main villain right away (who doesn’t even bother to get off his throne), without an overwhelming sense of “having to power up” for ages to take him on again; more like a general drive and purpose propelling the narrative.My complaints are few and far between, and one of them is complicated. There’s a very brief (like, several minutes if you know what you’re doing) “boss rush” type level with three encounters. At first I was flabbergasted at its customary inclusion, but after figuring it out I made short work of it and accepted how it slots into the big picture. Then there’s the Red Orbs (which you use to buy everything, from items to abilities to revives, on top of the traditional “extra life” Gold Orbs). Remember when it was announced that Capcom was monetizing the game’s currency? This is that discussion.In short, you can buy Red Orbs in bulk, even at the time of death to revive. It’s weird, in an “Xbox One launch” type of way back when it was considered new and didn’t even fly then. Now if you hate the mere thought of them even being included, you can skip out, I won’t be offended. But for the rest of you who are wondering if they impact natural advancement, I’d say “no.” Not once did I feel like I wasn’t earning enough orbs to buy what I wanted and progression felt roughly on par with the rest of the series. If you want absolutely every ability (including some of the endgame ones) you’ll need to go through the campaign at least twice across two different difficulty settings: that hasn’t changed.After the campaign is done you get to keep all your skills across all three characters, plus one extra endgame power that completely changes the way one of them plays. I started working my way through Son of Sparda (hard) as soon as the curtains fell without any sort of fatigue (those optional character levels are suited for replays). There’s also plenty of secrets to locate (including inventive ones with tricks like blowing up walls with V’s Devil Trigger minion) and extra difficulties. Dual-audio is being patched in at launch and the classic Bloody Palace mode (challenge rooms) arrives next month. It feels complete.I’m going to be playing Devil May Cry 5 weeks from now in the short term and years from now long term. This is the sort of fine-tuned wacky action game the genre deserves.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]Essential10s aren't perfect, since nothing is, but they come as close as you could get in a given genre. The new leader to beat in its sector, we're talking pure ecstasy.

Forbes,"DMC 5 - CapcomI go way back with the Devil May Cry series. My wife (girlfriend at the time) and I inadvertently began a tradition in 2001 when the original was released. She would sit and watch me play through games and she'd follow along as if it was a movie. She was the first and only girl I'd ever dated who would get into gaming with me on that level.That's one of the many reasons I married her the following year. Because of that experience, I've been excited whenever a new DMC is released, and the release of DMC 5 was no different. My takeaway is mostly positive, but not entirely what I hoped to get from the game.DMC 5 is beautiful on your screen or monitor. If you're playing in 4K, you will be treated to some of the most impressive action sequences, and they're all dancing on the screen with pristine clarity. The visual fidelity is in every aspect of the graphics package. The character's outfits, tattoos, hair, weapons and the plethora of explosions are beautifully rendered.DMC 5I don't think it's overstating the positive to suggest DMC 5 might be the most attractive action game I've seen. While the graphics are an obvious plus, there is a small issue with the visual experience. The camera can be a bit awkward. Depending on what part of the screen you're on, you can get lost in the chaos, or even made invisible behind a stationary object.This isn't nearly enough to make me down on the look of the game. If anything, it's most frustrating because I want to see more of this stellar amalgamation of lighting effects, gore, textures and Japanese anime-like action sequences.DMC 5I wish the sound was nearly impeccable like the visuals. In battle, the action is somewhat augmented by a soundtrack that fits the identity of the game and series. However, the speech from the characters amidst battles come off as mumbles in the more intense fights. There are some odd soundtrack choices in some areas too. Namely, on the DMC van where you upgrade weapons, the music is out of place, and it's hard not to notice.DMC 5Lastly, the dialog from the characters during the cutscenes is disjointed. V is one of the more annoying characters I've seen in an action game. I don't understand why he mumbles almost every word. While his weapons and magical powers are great, his speech comes off like a character who is supposed to have depth but is unaware that he exists in the video game equivalent of a B-movie. It's like Christian Bale's Batman interpretation abandoned the character and became enamored with Marilyn Manson, and now he's stuck in some sort of odd purgatory between the two personas.Unfortunately, everyone who isn't a demon is represented similarly disillusioned throughout the story.This deficiency spills over into the story. This just isn't a compelling journey. As a matter of fact, I actually had to fight sleepiness while watching the cutscenes. Part of the problem is the poorly delivered dialog, but beyond that the story is shallow.You're essentially charged with rescuing Dante, the original hero in the story. Dante appears to have been defeated by a demon and he's disappeared. Nero is the first controllable character. He's supposed to be hellbent on finding Dante, but the passion and determination aren't conveyed.V's mysteriousness is supposed to be compelling. You're supposed to be driven by unlocking his motives, but instead, I didn't really care. My desire to finish DMC 5 was entirely based on wanting to see the various bosses–because they're great–and just to say that I completed the game.The saving grace for DMC 5–beyond the visuals–is the pure action. DMC has always been a hack-and-slash masterclass and this version is no different. The variation of the characters and their unique weapons deliver a good bit of diversity. Each is fun to control in their own right. Also, it's a challenge to learn and acquire the different techniques attached to each character.You start to appreciate all of the differences, and it all works to establish a complete gameplay experience. It's hard to look for more from core gameplay than what Capcom provides in DMC 5.There is an element of microtransactions present, but it isn't a pay-to-win concept. You're consistently prompted to buy red orbs. You can get 100,000 for $1.99. The red orbs are used to buy combos, weapons or to continue when you've been killed. That sounds a little worse than it is considering there are a ton of red orbs throughout the game.You truly don't have to buy them. The combos aren't necessary to defeat any of the demons or villains you encounter, and from normal play, you'll attain the requisite orbs to continue even when you've succumbed to a boss. It's proof that not all microtransactions are created equally.The Bottom LineDMC 5 is beautifully rendered and the action is fun. However, the weak story and less-than-compelling character development and audio presentation remove the game's heart. Instead of being a masterful and complete action game, it's instead far more shallow than it could have been.Platforms: PS4, Xbox One (version reviewed), and PCRelease Date: March 8, 2019Price: $59.99 Score: 7.25/10 "

Login NowDevil May Cry returns for an explosive entry that delivers on plot, gore, and humor in ways that elevate the series beyond what it's accomplished before. It's been over a decade since the last core entry in the Devil May Cry series, with Devil May Cry 4 introducing players to a new character in 2008. Teenage Nero and his ""Devil Bringer"" arm initially presented series faithful with frustrations similar to that of Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, which introduced the then-new character Raiden.When fans found they were playing as Nero over Dante, at least for a good portion of the game, it was a bit of a shock, but critics and players alike ended up finding that they loved what he brought to the table. The game was ultimately a promising new direction for the series, and heralded great things for Devil May Cry as a whole.But then, after a brief pit stop with Ninja Theory's DmC: Devil May Cry reboot in 2013, there was nothing but radio silence for six years. Enter Devil May Cry 5, the first proper sequel to the core Devil May Cry continuity and the first new Devil May Cry game on current-get consoles like Xbox One and PlayStation 4. Bringing Nero, series mainstay Dante, and new character V together for an explosive combination of stylish action and lore expansion, it's the best the franchise has to offer so far by a country mile.As previously stated, this is a continuation of Devil May Cry 4, and continue the story it does. The story kicks off where an unknown man named ""V"" heads to the Devil May Cry office proper to enlist Dante to help him clear out a series of demon attacks taking place around the world. Dante pairs up with companions Lady and Trish to tackle V's little demon problem and soon realizes he may be no match for the powerful demon who needs slaying, named Urizen.As Dante and the others are swatted down like flies, Nero takes his shot as well, realizing he's no match for Urizen. As Urizen grows stronger and more powerful, Dante, Nero, and the newcomer V must work to take down the demon before the demonic tree he's growing through the nourishment of human blood can continue to flourish.That's the story in a nutshell – barring all the surprises that happen between the opening moments and the final wrap-up that results in the return of a fan-favorite character (by way of someone who's not who they appear to be) and something of a Goku and Vegeta-type rivalry between massively powerful beings. Suffice it to say, without spoiling anything, it's the most shocking end to a Devil May Cry game we've seen in the past, but it's full of good surprises, especially if you've been waiting for some sort of evolution of your favorite half-demons for quite some time. There may even be another joining the family, but mum's the word here.With that in mind, this is very much a story for those who have completed the entirety of the Devil May Cry series (excepting DmC: Devil May Cry) from start to finish. It culls from lore throughout the entire of the games, such as Dante and his brother Vergil, their father Mundus, the origins of Trish and Lady, and how Nero came to receive his demonic arm. You'll want to have at least played through some of the games or be familiar with the lore if you want to take this entry on. Devil May Cry 5 finds Nero back in the saddle again, though he's essentially armless this time around. His demonic Devil Bringer has been stolen, unceremoniously ripped away from his body, and he's forced to use prosthetics if he has any hope of destroying the droves of enemies that plague Red Grave City. He's a demon hunter with his own demon agency, lovingly referred to as Devil May Cry (with support from Dante, of course).It's not like he's using a plastic, hollow arm, though. He has tons of awesome arms called Devil Breakers, built for him by friend and engineer Nico, the granddaughter of the woman who created Dante's iconic handguns Ebony and Ivory. Devil Breakers run the gamut from what appears to be a white plastic arm with a back and forth motion (hinted at as"" good for Nero's girlfriend Kyrie,"" wink wink), a literal fork, and even Mega Man's iconic Mega Buster, with several others to choose from. With that in mind, the game's all about clearing a room or corridor full of enemies, collecting orbs (health, Devil Trigger energy, currency to purchase things) and then doing it all over again in a new area. Unlike the earlier entries, it's bereft of puzzles, placing the spotlight squarely on killing all the demons that you need to eliminate to progress. And that's fine by me, because I've never booted up a Devil May Cry game to solve puzzles. I want to cleave through demon flesh.And DMC5 does it with such panache that it feels like a celebration. It's ultra-stylish (as your performance is graded, of course) and feels fantastic, to the point where you enjoy fighting just as much as dashing through each level hacking through caches of red orbs and occasionally sticking nasty little ""booger babies"" (nidhoggs) into roots to open up areas. It's so enjoyable that I don't mind being interrupted going from point A to point B every few minutes to kill off various species of bad guys because it's so damn fun. Most of the fun stems from the different kinds of combat you can work with. Each Devil Breaker can be used multiple times until it breaks, or discharged immediately to cause a bigger blast and do more damage. Then, the next one in your magazine is ready to use. So if you select a few of your favorites to use, you can burn through them at your leisure as you cut through the hordes of demons.Unfortunately, though you can choose your loadout at the beginning of a mission, you cannot swap between your Devil Breakers at will. You must instead break the current one you have equipped to use the next one. This results in you having to be selective about which works best for you. Do you opt for the Punch Line which can fire rocket-powered left hooks or Helter Skelter, which features spinning blades? You might want to wear the Mega Buster (available with the Deluxe Edition I reviewed) for kicks. Since you have to find the arms out in the world if you don't buy the ones you want between levels, you'll deal with random ones instead. It's nothing to complain about, but something to keep in mind.V is an intriguing character to play as, because he doesn't actually lift a finger to fight himself. It may be unconventional, but it does add something of a refreshing and almost comical element to the story. He can summon the birdlike and panther demons Griffon and Shadow to aid him in battle instead. They simply do all the fighting for him, but V has to strike the final blow with his cane.As V, you need to stand back away from the action, occasionally using V's ""quick step"" to be pulled through the air by Griffon away from enemies so you can dash right up to them again and end their miserable lives. Instead of a Devil Trigger, V can summon the massive creature Nightmare, who's around for a short time and can make short work of enemies. V can read from the grimiore he carris around with him to charge up his Devil Trigger gauge for additional juice so you can keep trotting Nightmare out. While I enjoyed this fighting style, I couldn't help but wish there was additional variety, and there's that undeniable urge to want to be up close and personal with the action – but given the story reasons for V's weakness, I understood why that was the case. It does add a challenging layer to the game that we haven't seen before, however. And with any other weapon, we might have figured out V's secret sooner.Though Nero is undoubtedly the ""star"" of the game considering he's integral to the story, it's Dante who steals the show in terms of combat. This is the big Demon Hunter, the son of Sparda, it's freakin' Dante. Of course he's going to deliver with the big guns. And deliver he does, with his famous guns, shotgun, sword, uh...motorcycles, and the all-powerful Devil Trigger. It's even new and improved later on in the game with a souped-up version of the ability that absolutely wrecks everything in your path, making some of the later encounters a cinch. But Dante has it all, to the point where playing with him feels almost like cheating because he's so powerful. The man can wield motorcycles and beat demons to death with them by using two halves of one as blades. Come on.You won't switch off between the characters every level, but you do it every few chapters or so. Some will let you choose who you want to play as first, though you'll have to go back and do the other levels later as the others. This allows you to absorb more of whoever becomes your favorite, because you'll undoubtedly have one between the wildly varying play styles of Nero, Dante, and V.When you finish the game, you do have several goodies to look forward to. One such is Son of Sparda mode, a higher difficulty level that will whip you into shape. You can also browse character models, items you've collected, and look back on all the secret missions you partook in throughout the game. If you're feeling particularly creative, you can go back into the game and make good use of Photo Mode, which you can do no matter if you've beaten the game or not, but with access to all the levels at your disposal, you can go through and take some seriously impressive shots. It doesn't have all the same niceties of games like God of War or Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, but it can make for some awesome photos. There is co-op play, but only in the broadest sense of the word. Because I played ahead of the game's official release, I rarely experienced many sightings like this, but at certain intervals when all three characters cross paths, you may potentially run into the ""ghost data"" of other players. You might look off of a ledge and see them fighting demons while you're doing the same thing across the way. It never happened to me, likely due to a lack of player data, but they could even theoretically fight alongside you when it makes sense in certain areas.This will ramp up more when the game is out and everyone can play it, but it's a cool feature. At the end of a mission where another player makes a cameo, you can rate their performance as ""stylish"" or not, and if you end up receiving positive ratings yourself, you'll be rewarded with things like Gold Orbs. I would have vastly preferred traditional co-op play, but this made things interesting, and I felt like I needed to put on my best performance so others would rate me positively and I'd rack up the items. Plus, I wanted to look cool in front of my peers, of course. Devil May Cry 5 is an excellent action game. It's an even better Devil May Cry, perhaps the best the series has seen just yet. It's aesthetically pleasing in ways I never thought possible for the series, and chock-full of love for the fans, oozing out of every pore. From the throwback naming of demons that hearken back to the earlier days of the franchise to the style that drips out of every orifice, this is the best that Devil May Cry gets and more. Some fans may find the open-ended conclusion a bit frustrating, but I found it the perfect way to start laying groundwork for additional titles in the future. And judging by this game's quality? We're going to need them sooner rather than later. Trust me on this. This review is based on a PlayStation 4 download code provided by the publisher. Devil May Cry 5 will be available on March 8 via retail and digital stores on Xbox One and PlayStation 4.

					Brittany Vincent posted a new article, Devil May Cry 5 review: The devil you know 
					The only DMC I ever played was Ninja Theory's DmC: Devil May Cry. I had no idea it was a reboot but I thoroughly enjoyed it. If this new one is anything like it I will check it out.				
					[deleted]				
					Nice! Damn this also sounds amazing My Body is Ready! I am all pre-ordered up for my PC(pray it works in triple screen config on the PC for that would be insane!).  I personally fell in love with it during the XB1 demo so to read this review makes me Ultra Mega Hyped :) . The style, art, gameplay, sound, vibe is so Japan game design and I freaking love that(was what I was hoping for in the next DMC title), it just feels so right/has soul. That was my impression from just the demo, it is DMC done right and what it should progress to and what it should be. So happy right now, Brittany you made my day :) , thanks for the write up. Tomorrow is going to be an Epic day.				
					Review is as cool as the 5th installment of DMC. Nice!  Capcom is really going all out.  They've been introducing some of the best remakes of their most popular game series such as Resident Evil 2 and Megaman 11.  I can't help but have a strong feeling that Devil May Cry 5 will be the best game in the DMC series.  I love how I still get to see Nero and Dante.  I'm excited for the new protagonist as well.				
					This game should he held as an example to other developers of how to do a PC port.  It has better setting options than Metro, but a mile.  Also the HDR is amazing in this game which is nice to see given the mediocre implementation in the re2 remake.  				"
VG247,"Stylish action games are all about lightning-fast combat. It’s a genre where your moveset is so broad that it only reveals its true depth over multiple playthroughs. Devil May Cry 5 is one of the most technical yet. Rather than having just one character to master, here we have three. Newcomer V is weak and attacks with spectral animals called familiars. The twist is that V has to personally finish each enemy off, meaning he must get in and out of range constantly - he’s only effective when an enemy is staggered. Those familiars - which are partly controlled by AI - can be knocked out of action temporarily, too, causing the grotesque hordes to focus on you. You have to constantly keep V out of danger: a horizontal dodge causes you to skate along the ground with your panther familiar, Shadow; while dodging backwards summons your bird, Griffon, to fly you to safety. Not only does the timing of these affect V, but they cause your familiars to disengage. Knowing when to pull them out is key. V is all about spatial awareness, keeping an eye on health meters, enemy locations, spotting clusters for area of effect opportunities, and charging up your Devil Trigger gauge by reading poetry (yes). Get the gauge to at least three bars and you can summon Nightmare, a colossal familiar that bursts through scenery and autonomously fills the scene with explosions and laserbeams. Conjuring this massive creature instantly revives Griffon and Shadow, so timing is paramount.  
 
Though he’s the most complicated on paper (you’re essentially controlling three things at once), V feels built for newcomers. There’s some nuance in how you can charge up one familiar while moving out of danger and hammering attack with another, but he’s the easiest character to parse. Racking up those SSS ranks is a doddle - especially when you learn to chain together finishers, teleporting between enemies and driving your magical cane into their hides. The moody newcomer is fun to play for a while, but his lack of depth makes him the weakest of the roster. His familiars can also be a little frustrating, since you never have full control over their range and they don’t always do what you intend. Things are much better when it comes to Nero. The cocky youngster's moveset seems simple on the surface - one button swings your sword, another fires your gun, and another uses your Devil Breaker: prosthetic arms with varied abilities - but he’s more complex than it appears. You can hold buttons to charge up gunshots, launch enemies into the air, pause between hits to twist into a different combo, rev your sword to Exceed and unlock a fiery new moveset, and pull enemies towards you with a locked-on grab. But it’s in those Devil Breakers where Nero comes into his own. You equip a set of these prosthetics before each battle. There’s a Breaker that grabs and pummels enemies, one blasts out an electric charge, another burrows into demon flesh, one has a rocket-powered punch (which you can also ride), one fires out kinetic blasts, launching you through the air, and there’s another that fires out multiple whips, lashing enemies all around you. Each has its own purpose and ideal scenario for deployment. They also all have a charged technique that overclocks and breaks them once triggered. If you’re hit while a Breaker is active, it breaks, forcing you to equip the next. You can also manually break them to send out a powerful blast, damaging enemies around you - this also works to escape from otherwise unblockable attacks.  
 
The only way to get to the next arm in your inventory is to purposely (or accidentally) break the one you’re using. The idea is that Nero’s moveset constantly evolves as you play. When you want to switch, you have to sacrifice and commit. I can see high level players having a lot of fun with locking down the perfect Devil Breaker setups for each level, knowing exactly when to switch during each encounter. There’s a boss fight early on against a huge demon with a gaping mouth for a belly. In my first playthrough, I barely scrape through. In my second playthrough - on the more difficult Son of Sparda setting - I stagger him by exploding my Devil Breaker, then use the Buster Arm to pick him up by his tail and spin him around, launching him across the arena. It’s hard not to have Nero’s shit-eating grin plastered over your face when you’re lobbing a ten foot demon like a trash bag. Most games become less interesting as you replay them, but DMC 5 only gets better. It wasn’t until my third playthrough that I started really getting the hang of jump cancels, a high-level technique that allows you to stay in the air indefinitely. This is triggered by using a move called Enemy Step to interrupt any animation in the air. It’s one of the best ways to rack up an SSS rank combo, and there’s little more satisfying than picking off enemies by pulling them up into the air one at a time as their friends flail at nothing on the ground below. Some hardcore fans have been bemoaning the lack of ‘inertia’ - an unintended mechanic that allowed for more aerial showboating, a side-effect of DMC 4’s physics - but who cares when you can flow from a jump cancel straight into a rocket ride and back again? Despite the nuances of these two characters, though, it’s no accident that the game gives you control of series staple Dante last. The demon hunter is like a Swiss army knife where every attachment is secretly another, smaller Swiss army knife. He’s more versatile than duct tape. He has four fighting styles, and by the end of the game has four melee weapons and four ranged weapons. All of the weapons interact with the styles, and you can switch between styles and weapons with the tap of a button. To complicate things further, some of the weapons have multiple forms.  
 
Take the Balrog, Dante’s demonic gauntlets: pulling back on the left stick and pressing attack at the same time switches it between Kick Mode and Blow Mode, allowing him to flow from capoeira-style kicks to boxer-style punches in an instant. Hitting Circle while in the Swordmaster fighting style deploys a different move depending on whether you’re punching or kicking. You can also hold attack while in Blow Mode to trigger the Welter Move, allowing you to bob and weave, following up with powerful body hooks and uppercuts like a demonic Mike Tyson. While Dante is just as devastating in the air as Nero, he offers plenty of reasons for you to stay on the ground as well. Pair Welter Move with Trickster - a fighting style for swift escapes - and you can dodge, weave, and zip around the arena like a kid at a soft play centre. Use it with Royalguard and you can make up for mistimed dodges with blocks and counter attacks. Whatever firearm you have equipped is layered over this, as well as the ability to switch to Gunslinger to alter the abilities of your ranged attacks. Oh, and you can turn into two different demon forms based on two separate power gauges, with one charging the other. It’s ridiculous, but it somehow remains intuitive and never feels overwhelming. Capcom is a master of the genre it spawned. There’s an element of learning combos and button inputs, but that’s not really the focus - DMC 5 is about making split-second decisions constantly, reacting on the fly to breakneck encounters. None of the moves are over-complicated - the complexity comes from knowing how to stitch them together effectively. Techniques are often a case of pausing attack strings or flicking the stick at the right time. When you’re focused, it’s like you’re being controlled by some unseeable puppeteer. It’s intoxicating. It looks incredible in motion, too. Even with the online components that see other players fighting in the distance at parallel points in the story, the action doesn’t slow down. It’s as slick and smooth as a stylish action game should be. The animations sell it even more, from the way Dante and Nero slide across the floor to turn on a dime, to how V strokes the orbs of his downed familiars if you stand closeby.  
 
The only thing that lets down the presentation are the environments. Everything looks sharp - this is the RE Engine, after all - but the environments are dull. Broken city streets soon make way to dank sewers, and most of the second half of the game is spent roaming the identical corridors and hexagonal arenas of a demonic nest. Some of the secret missions, unlocked by lining up symbols in the scenery, are just as unimaginative. Collect all the red orbs in a library? No thanks, I’d rather be battering demons with this nunchaku that turns into a lightning staff. Likewise, the story doesn’t go anywhere interesting. It’s pure fan service. The series’ returning women - Trish and Lady - play simple bit parts (and also show you their bits and parts). They’re around for the beginning of the game, they disappear for story reasons, then turn up again later - completely naked - for other story reasons. Lady’s real name is Mary, but the moniker Dante bestowed on her is fitting here: she doesn’t really have a personality, she’s just a woman for boys to ogle. Same for Trish, a demon warrior reduced to flesh. It’s a dated depiction of women characters and doesn’t do justice to these previously playable badasses at all. By playthrough two, though, you’ll be skipping the cutscenes to get to the good stuff: that action. Like previous DMC games, this is designed to be played through multiple times. Difficulty in games is often wielded like a badge of honour. In DMC, it’s baked into the design. Whatever difficulty you start on (Devil Hunter here), you keep all your upgrades for the next playthrough. So while the enemies get more difficult, your characters grow stronger in tandem. 
 
Son of Sparda mode, unlocked at completion, is not just about giving enemies more health and letting them hit harder. Instead, it changes up the mix of enemies, throwing different variations at you earlier on and keeping you on your toes. Increasing the challenge really lets you see what you've learned and it keeps the combat interesting through subsequent runs. Though it’s not without its flaws, DMC 5 is a game where action is king. A layperson might think God of War and DMC 5 exist in the same genre, but they don’t. DMC 5 isn’t about going on an epic journey, meeting characters, and uncovering the mysteries of a world. It’s about riding a fucking rocket, flying it between enemies, flipping over a demon and shooting it in the head. It’s about pulling up your hood, taunting the hordes of Hell, and somersaulting sideways at the last second before launching into a flurry of sword strikes. It’s about murdering ten demons without your feet ever touching the ground. It’s about fighting and looking cool while you do it. In that, it’s an unparalleled success. Version tested: PlayStation 4.
