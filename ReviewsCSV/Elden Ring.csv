Link: Official siteThe Dark Souls series, including Demon's Souls and Bloodborne, were open worlds before the term referred to the structure of games like Grand Theft Auto and Assassin's Creed. Far off castles and swamps caught your eye, you puzzled out a linear path towards them, fell down a hole and went looking for a new destination. They didn't need maps or icons, because their worlds were dense with clues and lures leading to new paths and back to old locations.It worked, but spreading the mysteries and challenges of Dark Souls across an open world in the conventional sense—castles to infiltrate from many angles, swamps to ride through on horse, and beasts to chase you down—is the kind of thing you dream about.Elden Ring, FromSoftware's successor to the Souls series, is huge in comparison to the previous games, and what's in its open world is undeniably Dark Souls.It was a little better as a dream, though. The real Elden Ring is so much like Dark Souls at times that it feels distracting: there's a woman who levels you up, there's a throne to usurp, and many of the same types of monsters you find in Souls games, including some that are almost entirely identical. Scattering those things around an open world, it turns out, doesn't improve them, and robs them of the significance they had in the other games.The Souls games are excellent, so despite reusing much of what we've seen before, it all works. Where Elden Ring retreads the past, it's like playing a new, remixed and remastered version of a Souls game—with some frustrating technical problems to really replicate those old times.  And when Elden Ring reaches for something more, it soars.Elden Ring's first few hours might remind you of gentler times in a game like Breath of the Wild, but no, FromSoftware has not abandoned its traditional brutality. Because of the open world, there are opportunities to circumvent some of the third-person, hack-and-slash fights that would eviscerate you in another Souls game, but it's still difficult—for me, one of the most difficult FromSoftware games.Elden Ring features the same deliberate combat that's now conventional for these types of games, except here it's fully refined. You swing, the enemy swings, and both of you can interrupt each other's attacks with acute timing. The best Elden Ring fights, like the best Souls fights, ask that you study the way an enemy lunges at you and look for openings to punish them when they miss. In action, it's almost turn-based as you make your move and wait for the enemy to make theirs. These games are compelling because it rarely feels like the enemies use a different ruleset than you, so when you find a way to eke out a win, whether it's through magic spells or explosive bombs, it's like you outsmarted a dungeon master. Elden Ring echoes some of the best fights in the series with towering bosses and groups of enemies that force you to make snap judgments about which to prioritize, but it also echoes some of the worst, giving its late-game enemies and bosses so much health that beating them can be laborious instead of fun.It's the scale of it that tricks you into thinking it's gentler at first. I spent hours prodding at the autumnal landscapes of Limgrave and Liurnia and didn't meaningfully raise my stats enough to withstand more than a swing from one of the two early major bosses. I defeated creatures on the surface and underneath the Lands Between, picked up useful items and gear, and upgraded my kit with the blacksmith, but none of that prepared me for Elden Ring's biggest threats. There are weapons and shields that confer unique powers, such as a shield that deflects magic back at enemies or a sword that flings out a blade projectile after a short charge up. They're all fun to play with while fighting weaker enemies out in the open world, but when it comes time to fight inside one of the game's ""Legacy"" dungeons, which are essentially Dark Souls levels set in castles and swamps, they don't often make a clear difference.This glacial progression makes some bosses, whether within one of Elden Ring's tough ""Legacy"" dungeons or out in the world, seem insurmountable without another player splitting the attention of the boss so that, for at least a moment, you can squeeze a hit in. Elden Ring remained hostile for the 60 hours I've put into it, making the trek through it occasionally frustrating and directionless. One pocket of land might house undead soldiers who fall to pieces with a poof of magic, while another one might contain ruthless giants who can shrug off an axe cleaved into their side. I spent much of Elden Ring unsure of how strong my character was and where I could go. It makes sense from my character's perspective—she's intruding on the land that exiled her—but for me,  inscrutable encounters with high-health enemies felt like hitting an MMO level gate, except that because this is a Souls game, I couldn't tell whether I was expected to spend hours mastering these fights or leave them until later. That's one of the reasons Dark Souls worked better with carefully crafted boundaries.Torrent, the horse you can summon almost any time while outside of Elden Ring's delineated dungeons and caves, is part of the problem, too. There are worse horses to ride in games (you don't have to feed this one and it rarely gets stuck on rocks or shrubs), but galloping past massive enemies or through camps to pluck an item up from the ground can be exhilarating, especially if you're dodging enemy arrows and swipes.Eventually (or early on if I was feeling more adventurous), I faced fortifications and enemy types that specifically punished my four-legged freedom with heat-seeking arrows and trebuchet barrages. In certain areas, this pushback prompts you to use Elden Ring's surprisingly useful stealth mechanic to approach buildings, but other times it's hard to read what it's trying to convey. Torrent, while theoretically an empowering way to move through Elden Ring, led to confusion on how I should tackle certain battles or enemy camps.Once you understand the language of Dark Souls, it's clear where you should head next in its more contained world and where you shouldn't. A poison-soaked area might drain your healing resources on an initial run, but a forest nearby is full of  herbs to stock up on. Elden Ring's problems often have similar solutions, but because the map is so big and dense, it was hours before I understood where I was supposed to use items like anti-poison herbs and armor built to withstand magic attacks that I found.Ruts like that are worth climbing out of to see Elden Ring's most tremendous moments. In its early hours, Dark Souls appears to be a typical fantasy setting with skeletons and dragons, but it eventually unfolds into an hourglass world where golden cities gaze down upon flooded ruins. When Elden Ring isn't recreating these locations, including that very same city down to the windows, or the poison swamp, or its own vacant version of the hub area, it's magnetic.Elden Ring could have been anything, and yet, for an absurd amount of its length, it's disappointingly interested in reprising the Souls games.Below the Lands Between lies one of the most beautiful areas in FromSoftware's oeuvre, rivaling the sakura-hues of Sekiro's final act. That's where I fought the Ancestor Spirit, a graceful, magical stag pulled from Norse mythology. In contrast to Elden Ring's grotesque dragons and stoic knights, the Ancestor Spirit is otherworldly as it weightlessly glides through the air. The fight is backed by a sparse score that drives the slow pace of the fight to give you the space to soak it up. FromSoftware games are known for difficulty, but one of the developer's greatest tricks is turning the tension on its head with a fight that's almost purely thematic, with just enough to do to keep you present. The Ancestor Spirit is like being deep into a rhythm game where the buttons melt away under your fingertips and the music alone carries you to the end. It's nigh-transcendent, and an example of how hard Elden Ring's best moments hit, when the iconography of the previous games disappears and FromSoftware's skill at orchestrating these types of battles shines through.The reheated boss fights from the previous games undercut the impact. Although many of them are remixed and situated in different contexts, they are all blatant nods to what came before. I fought a spinning wolf with a sword in its mouth like Dark Souls' Sif, I dueled a knight with the same gait as Artorias, and I barreled through a library of minions to disrupt a floating boss that resembles Fool's Idol from Demon's Souls. Dark Souls 2 and 3 were full of references to the previous games, but neither of them promised to be a whole new universe birthed in part from the mind of a famous fantasy author. Elden Ring could have been anything, and yet, for an absurd amount of its length, it's disappointingly interested in reprising the Souls games, even if doing so puts it above so many other action RPGs. The infamous Basilisks that spew a lethal toxin at you are back again, except now those basketball eyes that weren't actually eyes are actually eyes. FromSoftware has seen the memes and the love for its games, and Elden Ring basks in it.Elden Ring guide: Conquer the Lands Between

Elden Ring map fragments: Reveal the worldDemon's Souls and Dark Souls didn't birth an entire genre and its voracious fans by being full of things the developer had already done. They created the trend, and Elden Ring simply continues it by using many of the same parts as the previous games. Its open world is bold, but Sekiro's new enemy types, emphasis on one-on-one combat, and parrying diverge from the Souls trilogy. While Sekiro didn't end up being one of my favorite of FromSoftware's games, I deeply respect it for the ways it asked for a very different approach.Instead Elden Ring carries forward a lot of the things you'd expect, including rough performance on PC. Over time, it tends to intermittently stutter and slow down for brief moments, especially as you're out in the open world. I never died to a hiccup in performance, but it made me pause and restart the game fairly often to fix the issue.  (Bandai Namco claims the day one patch will fix this.) There's a 60 fps lock, high RAM requirement, and limited graphics settings (you won't find DLSS or granular options for anti-aliasing). I hoped for better options and performance from a developer that's released several games on PC at this point.Like with Dark Souls, though, Elden Ring's technical flaws are worth putting up with and will hopefully be fixed soon, either by modder or official patch. And when it stops clinging to the past so much and you plop off a cliff after being chased by wolves and find a swirling gate that takes you far outside the known map to meet a hunched over beast man, the idiomatic dream logic of Elden Ring reminds you that no other developer creates fantasy worlds this repeatedly transfixing.Elden Ring is junk food for FromSoftware fans. It's more of what I already adore, but family sized. It has everything that makes these games so intoxicating, and that lodges their intricate fiction into my brain. But its devotion to what came before is distracting. It dulls the impact of those moments where Elden Ring leaps beyond its past to demonstrate why FromSoftware's games are unparalleled by all who attempt to replicate them. As another Souls game, I love Elden Ring, but as the latest game from FromSoftware, I wanted it to dream a little bigger.Elden Ring reaches new heights, but spends too much time in familiar FromSoftware territory.Tyler has covered games, games culture, and hardware for over a decade before joining PC Gamer as Associate Editor.

Eurogamer,"Die and knight cycle.At first, it's happening so slowly that you barely notice it. Out on the rolling, introductory fields of Limgrave, every encounter, no matter how small, is a risk - one that must be carefully weighted and considered before launching yourself into the fray.Every dank, echoing cave you step into could spell your doom, every seemingly sleepy ruin or settlement you pick your way through could be harbouring any number of twisted inhabitants seeking your cold, lonely end. Even out under the vast, open skies of these Lands Between you aren't safe. Your trusty steed Torrent might speed you from certain dangers, true, but even he isn't fleet-footed enough to outrun a tornado of dragonfire or a billowing cloud of poison spewed forth by a corrupted sentient flower. In this world, you start as nothing, no-one. But then, little by little, your power grows. The lowly bandits and wolves and soldiers you cut down turn to runes, these runes are channelled into power that steadies your sword hand, bolsters your spellcasting intellect, and enhances your ability to withstand a troll club full to the face. Bandits and wolves and soldiers turn to demons and witches and fey, and your power grows again. You feel you might be strong enough to journey south, to a ragged peninsula where beasts have overrun a castle by the sea; to the West, where lush marshlands have swallowed whole a once great centre for scholarly learning; to the East, where desert sands are stained red with blood and rot, or to the North, where a great golden capital lies, or perhaps you'll set off to a multitude of other faraway destinations between. As your power grows, so too does the challenge, and the wonder of the journey before you. Before long, you feel you just might be strong enough to challenge the demigods themselves.This is an ebb and a rhythm well-known to fans of From Software games by now. It's a song of life, death and a fading world of monstrous beings, with every refrain a challenge to get back up and try and die and try again. FromSoftware games - namely Demon Souls, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Sekiro - pride themselves on this particular genre of melancholic, masochistic action, and are in turn loved by fans for it - but they aren't known for being all that welcoming or accessible to new players. It's been clear for some time that with Elden Ring, the developer was hoping to satisfy core fans with ample challenge in a vast open world (the biggest the studio has ever undertaken), while courting potential new players with the promise of tools to help ease their passage through incredibly - and increasingly - unforgiving encounters. In this, Elden Ring is surprisingly successful. Veteran Soulslike fans will find stages set for epic showdowns set to test their resolve, while new players can call upon small and entirely optional devices that, while still demanding a certain level of skill before allowing you to carry on through the world, preserve the thrill without making you feel like you're repeatedly bashing your head against a brick wall. A lot of enemy encounters and even boss fights are made instantly more manageable with the simple inclusion of a distraction to buy you seconds of breathing room, and this part is played by new mechanic Spirit Summons, reusable items that spring forth echoes of beings to fight by your side until their death or the death of your enemy. Generally, their damage output will be laughable and they can only be summoned in certain areas. Thus, they aren't exactly there to hold your hand, but to buy you a few seconds of crucial time. Similarly, a mechanic whereby flasks of health and FP (your magic resource) are topped up after defeating an entire group of enemies can give you a helping hand when things get risky, but relying on this isn't without its own inherent dangers either. Then there are Stakes of Marika, where you can sometimes revive after death instead of a Site of Grace. It'll negate the sometimes lengthy and dangerous walk back to a boss battle, but you won't have the ability to change some of your set-up and loadout as you would at a Site of Grace. And utilising Great Runes, sources of great power found from felling some of the world's strongest beings, can be a huge boon when you need it the most, but again that doesn't come without a price. First, you need to activate the Great Rune, an obscure process on its own, and then you must choose to use an exceedingly rare, finite consumable item in order to tap into that power for as long as you stay alive. In true FromSoftware fashion, then, even when giving you the tools to move through the world a little easier, the underlying message is that nothing is free. Everything comes at a price, or with a tradeoff. For veteran fans, this is the experience you've come to expect from a Soulslike game, but the open world brings added thrills of discovery. It's clear that Hidetaka Miyazaki and co. delighted in the opportunity to create some truly stunning vistas - I gasped out loud at several extraordinarily beautiful landscape reveals - often showcasing From's trademark striking, haunting high fantasy with an incredibly subtle underpinning of dark humour. They may be huge and open but the Lands Between still feel meticulously hand-crafted; dark corners hide lonely secrets and forgotten tales richly woven into the tapestry of the world itself, through environmental storytelling, or an item description, or a single, seemingly throwaway line of NPC dialogue. You still get the structural ingenuity of Miyazaki's multi-layered world design in the tighter, more considered and more dangerous so-called legacy dungeons - self-contained areas that are set apart from the open world and hide its deadliest, most important foes. There are smaller dungeons out in the world as well, serving as warm-ups to the main boss encounters and making great practice for new players in particular, with their rewards generally consisting of a new weapon or an Ash of War to bolster your arsenal.Elden Ring's world is much more accessible in a literal sense as well - fast travel between discovered Sites of Grace, for instance, is unlocked very early on in the game and is almost always an option open to you, unless you're currently engaged in combat. At these Sites you can level up, enhance your healing flasks, set your spells and Great Runes and attend to those newly-earned Ashes of War - equippable weapon modifiers that can grant status effects like bleed, magic, or lightning damage to your weapon, while also granting it a special attack or effect mapped to the left trigger button. It's another way the gameplay has been subtly opened up. In previous From games these effects would have been permanently set to one weapon, but by allowing them to be freely switched around should the need arise From has given players the ability to more easily experiment and adapt as they go, so as to find a boss-winning strategy that could have otherwise been out of their reach without copious hours of grinding and upgrading. You may have noticed that I'm mostly steering clear of specifics when it comes to describing the world, boss encounters, sidequests or overarching story of Elden Ring. With good reason - this is the type of experience that benefits from you going in as unspoiled as possible. Fans can rest assured that you can find the usual mix of faux-Shakespearian tragedy, loveable if-odd bit characters and devious double-crossings, if you know where to look, but the world of Elden Ring is purposefully more alive than in other From Software games. The Lands Between are just tipping their prime, rather than existing in the throes of a full-scale, apocalyptic tailspin a la Lordran of Dark Souls. You'll meet a slightly more lively bunch of characters out in the world as a result - many of them more than once if you choose to follow their questlines. All that said, I'm also steering clear of specifics because I know that there's still so much left out there to discover, so much that will only become apparent post-launch. Even tackling later-game areas at level 50 and above still feels like barely scratching the surface of what the world has to offer, and in the tradition of From Software there are multiple endings to Elden Ring, with some perhaps requiring you to take some obscure steps, or even replays of the game, in order to achieve them.Whether Elden Ring successfully pulls in new players or not remains to be seen. The previously mentioned new mechanics may indeed make the game more accessible to newcomers, as does the enticing shift to a more open world structure, enabling you to simply nope out of a difficult battle, try your luck somewhere else and come back stronger and more prepared than before. That Soulslike games can't quite escape the reputation for challenge they've built for themselves is both a blessing and a curse - fans wear their dedication to these titles like a badge of honour, while potential players look on and may still feel uneasy about whether they'll be up to scratch, or if they'll even find enjoyment in FromSoft's particular brand of moreish torment. But, if there was ever a time and a particular game to get onboard with, it's now and it's Elden Ring. These experiences aren't for everyone, but this is the best and brightest (often literally) the series has ever been, and at launch new players will also have the added benefit of busy servers, meaning there will be plenty of other seasoned players to call upon in the game's co-operative multiplayer element if you're having trouble. ""Elden Ring remains a glorious game...""There are a few, small downsides. Elden Ring lacks a bit of polish here and there. On PS5, texture pop-ins are frequent and, pre-launch, we experienced a number of hard crashes to the console home screen. Gameplay-wise, not all new features are created equal. Torrent is a welcome way to explore the landscape from relative safety, for instance, but mounted combat can sometimes feel more awkward than epic, as you and enemies circle around one another in wide sweeps, swiping at the air and connecting with nothing for what feels like an embarrassing number of passes. Additionally, item crafting and resource collection feel like inclusions drawn from other games, rather than something that feels necessary here. Mileage may vary of course, and other character classes may benefit from it more than others, but for all the emphasis put on crafting by the proliferation of recipe cookbooks and ingredients I found out in the world, my spellsword Prisoner class barely ever had a need to make anything, with the exception of a couple of poison-staunching boluses. Melee or ranger classes needing ready access to arrows or thrown items might well feel differently, however. Also, in all honesty, George R.R Martin's heavy inclusion in the marketing for the game remains rather baffling; the exact nature of his contribution is unclear at best. One can only assume it was a collaboration designed to raise the game's profile in non-hardcore circles, but if there's one studio that needed no help in crafting an enticing dark fantasy game world, From Software is it, and George R.R Martin's cultural currency in 2022 is hardly enough to change the trajectory of Elden Ring's success on its own. All that said, Elden Ring remains a glorious game, one that established fans are going to savour for some time to come, and one that may just welcome new fans into the FromSoft fold. Sumptuous visual design, dark and detailed lore and a vast-but-intricate open world are reason enough to venture out into the Lands Between. Add to that FromSoftware's unforgiving and unforgettable gameplay loop and this is something truly special.

Metro GameCentral,"The makers of Dark Souls present an open world take on the Soulsborne formula that may be the biggest, and most difficult, game of the year.In just over a decade FromSoftware has managed to go from an obscure Japanese developer, with not a single mainstream hit to their name, to one of the most revered studios in the world, whose every new game is subject to the same level of anticipation and scrutiny as a top tier Nintendo or Naughty Dog title. Much of that is due to director Hidetaka Miyazaki, whose work on the original Demon’s Souls was largely overlooked but who changed the face of gaming with Dark Souls, which made it fashionable for video games to be unforgivingly difficult.As far as most modern video game design is concerned having a player fail, or not know exactly what to do at every moment, is a cardinal sin but Miyazaki sees both as essential features. There’s no cloying safety net in any of his games, including Elden Ring which despite the name, and the details of the plot, could easily be retitled as Dark Souls 4.There are two main reasons why it’s not, the first being that it has a much bigger budget, and therefore more technically advanced graphics, than any previous From game. The second is that it is open world. All the previous games were to at least a limited degree but Elden Ring is open world in the modern Ubisoft sense of the phrase. At times it’s very easy to see this as Zelda: Breath Of The Wild’s older, goth brother but the heart of the game is a very familiar Dark Souls style combat system… and the agony and ecstasy that its precision-based action brings.The names may be different but most of the basic concepts in Elden Ring are the same as Dark Souls, and indeed Bloodborne and Sekiro. Runes collected from defeated enemies are souls in all but name, while Sites of Grace work identically to bonfires, and while you’re now a Tarnished instead of a Hollow the difference is academic.What being a Tarnished means is never made very clear but like all From games Elden Ring’s story starts at the point at which the forces of evil have essentially won. The only plot point that matters for the first dozen or so hours is that the titular Elden Ring has been broken into pieces and you must recover them from the various demigod characters that play the role of the game’s toughest bosses.Reforge the ring and you will be able to become Elden Lord, although even those unfamiliar with From games will immediately sense that this is not necessarily a role to covet. Nothing is quite what it seems in Elden Ring and even apparent allies shouldn’t be fully trusted, as you’re left to interpret the story from snippets of conversation and item descriptions.The first thing anyone really wants to know about a new From game is how hard it is. While that’s usually difficult to quantify the easiest way to describe Elden Ring is as the most accessible game they’ve ever made. It is often punishingly difficult, but there are more safeguards than previous games as while you lose all your runes after death, and have only one chance to reclaim them, they’re also often obtained as coins that can be stored permanently in your inventory.Using a Site of Grace restores all nearby minor enemies to life (undeath?) but you can use fast travel at almost any time to move between them. There’s almost never a long walk to a boss battle and generally the game tries to avoid wasting your time unnecessarily and is less spiteful in terms of inflicting unfair punishments, such as the curses of Dark Souls. That’s all relative to previous games though and if you haven’t played one before you should, as the tagline says, prepare to die. A lot.Rather than difficulty, it is freedom which is at the heart of Elden Ring’s appeal. Instead of being a puppet for the developer, merely carrying out actions as they’re flashed on-screen in front of you, how you play is entirely up to you, with the only suggestion the game offers coming from Sites of Grace that point you in a general direction.What you do to get there, and how you handle things when you arrive, is entirely up to you but broadly speaking the game is split between progressing through more enclosed spaces, such as castles that really could pass for something out of Dark Souls 4, and more freeform exploration and levelling up in the open world.Despite the very first enemy you come across being a mini-boss, that you have no hope of beating for several hours, the first temptation on reaching the open world is to simply tour around, marvelling at the visuals. This is made much easier an hour or so in, when you get access to a spectral steed that you can summon near instantly and which can fall a considerable height without taking damage.Relatively easy to obtain maps make clear the main points of interest but it’s still incredible what you can stumble on without any warning, even if they later turn out to be part of the main plot. Bumping into evil wizards at what seems to be the site of a meteorite crash, as they summon a giant dark elf for who knows what purpose, is all par for the course in the world of Elden Ring.At one point we passed an innocuous looking building, unusual only in that it wasn’t a ruin like most others, and found its only contents were a lift. One that travelled seemingly miles into a hollowed earth environment filled with weird moss men that attack in slow motion and strange ghost Vikings that can appear out of nowhere. The area is so big it has its own map, and entirely unique atmosphere and puzzles, and yet we could easily have passed it by with no idea it was there.There are no fetch quests in Elden Ring – technically there are no missions at all – and while there are some repeated concepts, such as the underground mines that litter the game world, everything feels handcrafted, with secrets pilled upon secrets.On a technical level Elden Ring is nowhere near as complex as Horizon Forbidden West but its open world is considerably more interesting, and arguably more attractive. The grotesque beauty of From’s art design can never receive enough praise, from the verdant landscapes of the opening area to the disturbing ugliness of some of the enemy designs, which are mesmerising in their horribleness without ever resorting to being obnoxiously gross.Never knowing quite how far to push your luck as you explore is one of the game’s primary thrills, but it’s made clear that travelling east is only for the foolhardy. That entire area of the map has been overrun by a supernatural infection, as your journey becomes an almost literal descent into Hell, with especially horrific monsters and a disturbing soundtrack that causes near physical revulsion the further you press on.According to FromSoftware, Elden Ring can be beaten within 30 hours if you take the golden path through the game. Maybe that’s possible if you’re the sort of person that can beat Dark Souls blindfolded while using a Guitar Hero controller, but we got the game a week ago and that’s not been nearly enough time to explore every nook and cranny.Others may have different approaches, but we generally progressed by following the main story path until we felt underequipped and then went back to the open world to look for new optional areas and enemies to level up with. This seemed to work well, both in terms of keeping our character battle ready and avoiding getting bogged down at a particular impasse.Elden Ring is an action role-playing game but another noticeable difference from earlier games is that choosing a character class at the beginning is far less of a stab in the dark than it used to be. There are pros and cons to each but it’s now much easier to personalise the stats to your playing style even if they’re not initially that well suited.As in Dark Souls, combat can involve any combination of melee weapons, ranged weapons, and magic. A banal statement which grossly underplays the incredible range of different swords, polearms, axes, hammers, whips, Wolverine claws, daggers, bows, crossbows, and shields. As well as a host of completely separate magical disciplines that are so diverse there’s two separate stats governing their use.Elden Ring is an incredibly deep game, with such a range of different items and systems that you can forget some elements – many of which would sustain a whole other game in its entirety – are even present. Not only can every weapon be upgraded but so can the flasks you use to refill your health and magic points, plus a separate customisable flask you can imbue with more unique abilities.There are spirits you can summon to help in battle (which can also be upgraded if you help out an otherwise innocuous side character) and collectible Ashes of War that can add extra skills to weapons, as well as elemental affinities such as fire or lightning. There’s a complex item crafting system, a series of talismans that add perks, and numerous one-off concepts such as a strange woman who offers free hugs and an item that can boost your poise stat – an important concept in combat, that prevents your attacks from being interrupted by enemies.The combat itself is relatively simple, with generally only a handful of moves for each weapon and no combos. It’s difficult, of course, everyone knows that whether they’ve played one of the previous games or not, but arcade skills are the least of Elden Ring’s requirements for victory. Instead, what you’re really being tested on is your attention to detail and your ability to form effective strategies based on available information.The abilities and attack patterns of enemies have to be learnt, which requires a degree of trial and error, but the vast majority of times you’ll die not because your reactions weren’t quick enough but because you got overconfident or impatient. The bosses are a highlight, in terms of both game design and difficulty, but as in any From game they can be made almost trivial by calling in a co-op player to help, or even just making use of in-game cooperators that can be summoned before a fight.99% of the time death is always clearly your fault, although the lock-on system can be frustrating as to when it chooses to break its lock and reacquire an opponent, although that generally only happens with less powerful enemies moving in groups. The only other complaint that can be levelled is the awkward platforming, which is a relatively important part of the game but still feels underdeveloped – although simply adding some better animation would alleviate most of the issues.If there’s a wider criticism to be made it’s that despite it all Elden Ring is exactly what you’d expect from an open world Dark Souls game. The details are just as imaginative and unpredictable as you’d hope but the overall concept and structure is not necessarily as surprising and does little to move forward the open world concept as a whole.Arguably, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, which is not technically a Soulsborne game, is the more avant-garde take on the formula but whether that counts as a disappointment depends on precisely what you were expecting Elden Ring to be.Taken on its own merits this is an absolute triumph and reconfirms FromSoftware as one of the most talented video game creators of all time. If you’re already a fan of their work you won’t need any more convincing from us to play Elden Ring, but if you are intimidated by the reputation for difficulty we can only encourage you to try it anyway.Alan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNew Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart bundle is £50 off reveals leakXbox will be less hands-off with Bethesda amid major reorganisationAlmost everyone starts a From game with the assumption that it’s too hard for them but the real magic comes not from the exquisitely complex level design, the perfectly orchestrated boss battles, or the deftly maintained atmosphere but in the fact that the games make you feel better about yourself as a player and a person. Even if you never beat the game, the perseverance and dedication needed to get anywhere is reward enough beyond its other qualities.Elden Ring follows the best traditions of what has come before but it presents them on a scale, and with a degree of accessibility, that has never been seen before. If it does not end up being game of the year then 2022 will be one for the ages, as Elden Ring already is.In Short: A masterful blend of Dark Souls and Zelda: Breath Of The Wild that makes high demands of its players and yet still remains surprisingly accessible and adaptable.Pros: Incredibly well designed game world, in terms of both the open areas and more enclosed spaces. A near infinite variety of things to see and do, with nuanced combat and varied enemies.Cons: In strict gameplay terms there’s not actually much new here. Target lock system can be a little fiddly in crowds.Score: 9/10Formats: PlayStation 5 (reviewed), Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, and PCPrice: £49.99Publisher: Bandai Namco EntertainmentDeveloper: FromSoftwareRelease Date: 25th February 2022Age Rating: 16Email gamecentral@metro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter.

FromSoftware is my darling, as it is for so many people, and there's no game it's made since Demon Souls that I haven't played through at least twice (or much more). So bear in mind that these are the thoughts of a Soulsborne veteran, not a fresh-faced adventurer ready to experience his first taste of terror. And I'm a prisoner of that reality, leaving me horrified and fascinated by the idea that Elden Ring really could be the best FromSoftware game. Release date: February 25, 2022
Platform(s): PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC
Developer: FromSoftware Inc.
Publisher: Bandai NamcoEven saying it, I find it hard to believe - surely Dark Souls and Bloodborne can't actually be surpassed, right? Those games were bona fide masterpieces, and in the case of Dark Souls, era-defining masterpieces. You don't just improve on something like that, it doesn't make sense. It'd be like Beethoven waving away Ode to Joy as a rushed warm-up to the real thing. We're going to have to unpack this, and start at the beginning - which in Elden Ring's case, is definitely Torrent.Yes, it's an oversimplification to describe Elden Ring as ""Dark Souls meets Breath of the Wild"", but it's not totally inaccurate and works as a starting point for what we're dealing with here. And yes, the DNA of Dark Souls runs deep in Elden Ring, to the point where this could very plausibly have been Dark Souls 4. Even the title screens look the same.The Breath of the Wild element is all in the world design. Gone is FromSoftware's tangled spaghetti of interlinking paths, and now we have a wide, expansive continent, where rolling plains rise up to ominous mountain fortresses, or descend to… well, poison swamps, mainly. There's a fair few of those. So now you can go wandering in practically any direction and find something new to kill (or, more likely, be killed by).That's where the horse, Torrent, comes in. More than a simple gameplay gimmick, Torrent has to exist because the sheer scope of this world means walking was always going to be too slow. Consequently, a lot of threats are optional now. The first boss you encounter is a towering cavalry knight you're horribly under-leveled for, but then you realize you could always just… walk around him. Or go in the other direction. Or just power past on Torrent making insulting noises while he shakes his first in impotent rage! As a result, you rarely get into fights if you don't want to, at least out in the open. Torrent can outpace practically any threat and you can flee in any direction, so when six tons of scaly heartburn drops onto the road before you, you just scamper between its legs and vanish into the sunset like the goddamn Roadrunner. Sounds surprising, but this is the intentional experience - there are a lot of late-game threats spread across the world, even in the early areas, and a big part of how you play is deciding what you're going to confront and what you're going to slink away from until later. I suspect this is why people have been talking about Elden Ring being the most accessible, or even easiest FromSoftware game. I guess that's half true. It's not that Elden Ring is empirically easier - there are boss monsters here that could give Isshin Sword Saint or the Orphan of Kos a run for their money - it's just that the really punishing elements are basically self-inflicted. You deal with them when you choose. More accessible? Yeah, I'll give it that. Easier? Not so much.But as somebody very used to Dark Souls, I found myself getting into the combat groove quickly enough. It's the same scrappy, stamina-saving stabbing, staggering, and spell-slinging that we know and love, but with a few quality of life improvements, not to mention some bones thrown to those who are getting their feet wet for the first time (something I've no doubt will make the get-gudders sneer). Bows and arrows no longer suck, which was a nice surprise, weapon upgrades have been simplified a bit, tutorials are now items in your inventory you can check at any time, and there's the power to summon helpful NPCs by spending mana. Whenever I found myself getting mangled by goons, I could ring a little bell like a thirsty toff in Downton Abbey and have a manservant with a glaive come hurrying out of the spirit dimension to help. Between fights I found myself wandering the world, scooping up flowers, and enjoying the scenery, at least when it wasn't spitting horrors at me. There's a crafting element now - all the bits of bracken and bones you find while sightseeing can be combined in your menu to create consumables. It's a bit vestigial though; you don't start with many recipes so the instinct to craft things never really got hardwired into me. Still, it's not offensive. It occasionally served as a means to craft basic arrows, and it did lessen my fear about burning up limited items when I could always boil up some more from the parsley and demon offal stuffed down my underwear.Even if you're not going full survivalist, traipsing around the wild is a pleasure anyway. Elden Ring's setting - the Lands Between - has a singular vibe of its own, close to classic Miyazaki with added Norse and Arthurian storytelling stirred in. The life-giving world tree looming over you, the legion of heroic knights and their literal round table, the fallen gods seeking ascension, it's all very mythic in appearance and tone. But emotionally I'd say it's nearest to Sekiro, because this world isn't quite dead on the vine or locked in frantic madness yet. There's clearly some attempt by the rulers to keep order, it's just all been handled very ineptly. And this bleeds through into the world design nicely. Soldiers march the roads, keep checkpoints at key locations and even create magical jails that hold some optional boss fights. Where civilization and the wild make contact, you'll usually see some kind of brawl between knights and slavering monsters, barricades thrown up to keep out the worst nature has to offer. It's all part of the confusion that's clutching this world: nobody here seems to know who's in charge or why they really deserve it. As a result, your own Tarnished feels like an opportunist, using the uncertainty to grab what power they can while the chance is there.The world itself is suitably gorgeous. Each region has a clear visual theme that marks it out, but enhanced by creative design. The swamps and lakes to the West have eerie balloons floating over them, half-visible in the mist. The fiery wastelands couldn't just be singed rocks, they're overgrown with fat, tumorous growths that make it feel like the land itself is diseased. And a dragon the size of a skyscraper has crashed into the gods' golden capital, its body draped over the palatial architecture. Could a world by Miyazaki be anything other?And though the Lands Between is gruesome or solemn at times, it's also palpably full of life, giving it an optimistic energy no Soulsborne game has had so far. Sheep graze in the grasslands and scatter as a flock as you ride past, while elk flit through the forests and eagles give piercing stares from clifftops. Even the flowers glow with magical brilliance, little torches in the undergrowth that add color and light to your journey. And at any point, you might find a little crevice in a rock wall that leads to a vast underground city, monster lair, or bandit camp. The size of this game still staggers me now.But I'd say the design peaks in the monster variety and creation, which is pretty jaw-dropping. Even the standard enemies are some of the most bewildering, bewitching horrors I've seen. From the underground aquatic ant-wasps of the Ainsel River, to the cherub-winged hag-dogs of Castle Morne, to the scuttling ringed hand-spiders of Mt Gelmir… It's a little overwhelming. I could spend years building my FromSoftware Pokedex, and the bosses, as ever, are the moment Elden Ring ramps things up to eleven. The usual cabal of legendary warriors and unspeakable atrocities, they come crashing towards you with unbridled bombast, ferocity, and cinematic flourish, as well as an orchestral score that sounds like the world is ending 10 times over and refuses to let you feel anything but total, terrified awe.But let's address the few issues I have with Elden Ring - the visual design is superb, but the graphics themselves are a little bit unconvincing when seen close-up in cutscenes. There are moments where the openness of the world can make progress feel a bit aimless or uncertain, and much of the enemy AI could be outsmarted by a potato battery. At one point I was taking potshots at a legendary mage of great renown, but my character being partially concealed behind a door frame meant she struggled to work out why her head kept sprouting arrows, refusing to move even as I relocated several quivers' worth of ammunition into her brain.There's also an argument to be made that Elden Ring's not as revolutionary as it could've been. As fantastic as it is to have an open world Soulsborne, I wouldn't have minded Elden Ring carving out a little more of an identity for itself beyond being ""Dark Souls, but wider"". It's a small gripe though - being similar to a game I love isn't really much of a criticism, only that I'm ready for a little more of a jump next time.And it definitely doesn't detract from the overall experience. When Elden Ring hits the rails, the momentum carries it forward and refuses to slow down. My peaks of rage at being stomped on by towering titans never stopped being fun despite that, with that very particular form of masochistic joy you get from wrestling with FromSoftware games. It might not be as groundbreaking as its inspirations, but taken on its own terms, Elden Ring might be the best of its brethren - and that's something I'm still struggling to believe has actually happened.Reviewed on PS5 on a copy supplied by the publisher.Joel Franey is a writer, journalist, podcaster and raconteur with a Masters from Sussex University, none of which has actually equipped him for anything in real life.

Game Informer,"Once in a great while, a game comes along that seamlessly combines impeccable gameplay, a wondrous world, incredible tone-setting music, and unparalleled art direction. That game is From Software’s Elden Ring, an action RPG that channels the best aspects of the studio’s last decade of work into one enormous package. This absurdly ambitious open world captivated my curiosity, enticed me with puzzles, secrets, and mysteries, and served up unbelievably satisfying moments as I experienced one of the most extraordinary adventures of all time. From my initial foray into the world to the final moments, every step of the journey is a note in a personalized epic that kept me coming back for more. This trek through dark and twisted fantasy is an endless exploration, continually serving up sensational sights that only get more enthralling and fantastic as the voyage goes on.The Lands Between is a world full of discovery, and while a clear path forward exists for those seeking guidance, roaming the lands unfettered without a particular goal in mind often yields surprises. I often had a spot to explore marked on my map and got off-track along the way, sometimes leading to entirely new areas and feature-dense zones. Elden Ring is not a theme park-style open world where each ride is bolstered by breadcrumbs so they won’t be missed – there are significant areas, bosses, dungeons, and other huge revelations that can be passed by, making these finds even more delightful. Even after over 55 hours, I know that I’ve missed plenty. Instead of pining over what I haven’t found, I’m inspired to keep exploring. The grandiose world is chock full of characters, quests, and various dungeon crawls ranging from tiny catacombs to massive multilayered tombs. While the journey starts with little caves, mines, and other dungeon delves, these experiences become more complex. Two-room affairs eventually become intricate teleport puzzles or scenarios where you discover unusual ways to interact with the environment, like learning to use traps for traversal or sniffing out secret walls. Even the most straightforward overworld dungeons house hidden boss rooms and treasures, in addition to their standard yields, rewarding the most inquisitive adventurers. Finding creative ways to travel to places that don’t appear accessible before the standard path guides you there feels remarkably refreshing, and more than one area delivers picturesque vistas upon arrival. Looking over a new area for the first time and realizing you can go everywhere you see is breathtaking and overwhelming. Some open-world locals, like churches, ruins, and Erdtrees, feel a bit familiar from realm to realm, but make no mistake there are numerous and unique points to explore and get lost in for hours. From mysterious castles to haunted magical grounds, the world is full of exciting diversions.  Your character is incredibly customizable, which I found highly rewarding. You can attach various skills and scaling mechanics across the board, allowing you to truly create your own vision of a traveling hero. Respecialization and alterations allow you to finely tweak your creation without worrying too much about experimentation along the way as you arm yourself with everything from explosive pots to potent perfumes to complement your ever-growing arsenal. Combat will vary greatly from player to player and build to build, but the precise dance of melee combat is more refined and diverse than ever. Featuring a behind-the-scenes stagger system that rewards players for taking chances with timing, the flow of battle makes the singular spammy strike a lesser choice in the face of a daunting foe.The open world is majestic, dripping with flavor and atmosphere, and full of fabulous finds. However, the legacy dungeons are the stuff of legend, often connecting to the outside from multiple points. These curated sprawls are a dream to dissect, and Elden Ring often offers different ways to maneuver through these areas. For instance, in one of these giant dungeons, I discovered a completely different way to “solve” the route to the final boss – and then went back and found a divergent path through another environment, leading to a wealth of battles, bosses, and loot. Sometimes, access to certain areas is in the last place you look, but the route to unearth it is laden with even more attractive paths to pursue.While some monster and boss designs are reused, the scope and scale of Elden Ring are enormous, which makes the repetition easy to ignore. I feel like I ran into around one hundred bosses in my playthrough. I’m not exaggerating. Some of these can feel commonplace and uninteresting, at the end of a small dungeon, like a repeat cave troll or magma drake, but the overall diversity of encounters meant that I never knew exactly what I was going up against at the end of any given expedition. I might run into a reskinned knight, but I might also go toe-to-toe against something truly astronomical. The big bosses, generally found at the end of legacy dungeons, feel like wonderful wars against demigods. These brilliant set piece battles are thrilling exclamation points to an outrageous odyssey, absolute spectacles, and masterful combinations of tension and triumph. Elden Ring has the distinction of having the best and most challenging boss battle in any From Software game to date. Hidden away and optional, this encounter had me waking up in the middle of the night to come back and crash against its beautiful and terrifying destruction over and over again. After finally besting this opponent, I let loose a triumphant victory roar there while sitting in the dark and wearing my pajamas, wanting nothing more than to experience the encounter again. This example speaks to how unbelievably compelling and immersive Elden Ring is; I regularly put it down with the intent of doing something else and found myself back within minutes. There is always one more gnawing mystery to unravel, one more boss to beat, and one more hidden route to find.Elden Ring challenged me, captivated me, and enchanted me, an unyielding deluge of discovery and artistic vision unbound. Elden Ring represents a truly amazing combination of various game elements that all come together to create something fascinating, special, and unforgettable. Elden Ring isn’t just the best game this year; it’s one of the best games ever made.

    Tamoor Hussain
   on March 16, 2022 at 10:42AM PDTFifteen hours into Elden Ring, I defeated Godrick, the first of five Elden Lords. In the time between emerging into the Lands Between and striking him down, I'd discovered decrepit ruins, ventured into twisting caves, stumbled upon enemy encampments, and battled tooth and nail against challenging bosses. From Software's games have always made you feel small in many ways: They tell you that you're worthless--a plague-ridden rat or accursed Undead, unfit even to be cinders. They ask you to navigate unflinching brutal worlds and pit you against enemies that systematically dismantle your ego. Elden Ring maintains the nail-biting combat and air of mystery that has distinguished From Software's Soulsborne games, but it's elevated to new heights by the studio's interpretation of what an open-world game can be. Having brought down Godrick, the breadth of the world--and the way in which From Software has applied its signature style to an open world--was on full display, reinforcing how insignificant I really was and driving home the magnitude of the task that still awaited me.Standing on the edge of a cliffside in Liurnia of the Lakes, the area beyond Godrick's arena, I took in the world laid out in front of me: the enormous Erdtree casting brilliant golden beams of light onto the land that exists in its shadow; the sharp peaks of a distant mountain that look like claws tearing at the sky; a castle standing proudly amidst ruins; a forest blanketed in an ominous fog. It was all overwhelming, and none of the hardships I'd experienced in Demon's Souls, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, or Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice have come close to making me feel as small. At the same time, I was overcome with excitement for what the Lands Between had in store for me and all the seemingly insurmountable battles awaiting--and it did not disappoint.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

But what makes it special isn't just how visually stunning it all is, or that its open-world is vast, rich in detail, and teeming with possibilities. Instead, it's how the studio has applied its own esoteric design principles to deliver an experience that feels fresh, elegant, and uniquely From Software. The game's core pillars are built on the same strong action and role-playing foundations as previous titles while offering more freedom to explore than ever before. Elden Ring is an open-world game entirely in a category of its own. That delicate orchestration of highs and lows and the build-up and release of tension that From Software has mastered, coupled with the thrill of freeform exploration and discovery, is an intoxicating cocktail of game design.In guiding the player, Elden Ring employs the lightest of touches. The Lands Between is truly open and offers the player complete agency in exploration, whether on foot or horseback. The world is ruled by five Elden Lords, each in possession of a shard of the titular Elden Ring. As a lowly Tarnished, you aim to defeat these corrupt lords, take their shards, stand before the Erdtree, and become an Elden Lord in your own right. With the premise established through a quick cutscene, you are let loose and left to forge a path through the world as you see fit.A key part of From Software's design ethos is to strip down to the essentials, and in Elden Ring that process strengthens exploration and discovery, the heart and soul of the experience. The studio's games typically give the player very little while asking a lot, and Elden Ring is the most obtuse and demanding of its games so far. This is largely because everything you've come to expect from modern open-world games is absent; for instance, there's no map until you find an item that reveals the topography of a region. Even then, the points of interest in that region aren't marked until you've been there and seen them. There is no minimap, just a compass to show the cardinal directions and any waypoints you've placed.Characters, meanwhile, aren't desperate for your attention; as with previous games, the quests they task you with aren't noted down or tracked in any kind of log--it's up to you to do your due diligence. Areas you go to won't be gated depending on your level, and there's no clear indication on when you should go to key locations. The best you get is at the Sites of Grace, which function as rest points in the same way Bonfires, Lanterns, or Idols did in other titles. At each of these sites is a dim trail of golden light pointing in the general direction of… something. Perhaps it's the next milestone in your quest or maybe it's just another area that has a dungeon--the only way to find out is to make the journey.The challenge for From Software lies in the friction between the studio's design hallmarks and the expected conventions of a genre filled with games that try to be all things to everyone. And although the execution is an unmitigated success, one thing's for sure: Elden Ring is not a smooth-edged, one-size-fits-all kind of experience that will accommodate everyone. Instead, it's unrelentingly opaque, relishes in the savagery of confronting players with unfavorable odds, and delights in watching the ensuing struggle. Elden Ring's gameplay will feel familiar to those with experience of previous From Software games. The tried-and-true formula of measured third-person combat against enemies that are swift to punish foolhardiness is both as thrilling and nerve-racking as ever. Whether you wield a sword and shield, swing something that's closer to a heap of raw iron, or stand back as a mage and launch spells to topple your foes, Elden Ring tests patience and skill with tricky enemy mobs and ferocious bosses.From Software has added some new gameplay wrinkles to its Soulsborne formula this time around, most notably a jump, which has been pulled from the more dynamic movement style of Sekiro. This is useful not just for traversal but also for performing a leaping strike that can break through an enemy's defense and create a critical strike opportunity. Another new mechanic is the ability to strike back after blocking an enemy's attack with a heavy counter--dealing a good amount of damage and, if it's part of a sustained offense, could even leave the target open to a critical strike.This heavy counter has some of the satisfaction of Bloodborne's gunshot and visceral combo, though it's not as gratifyingly dramatic. While it's easy to rely on it, a great deal of strategy is still needed to perfectly execute it--an enemy's quick follow-up strike could cut you down before you've initiated the counter. The new gameplay mechanics certainly provide more options against tough foes, but they still require the player to know their opponent and carefully select their moments.The last major addition is Spirit Ashes, which allow the player to summon upgradable AI-controlled fighters to their side. These can range from a pack of wolves that aggressively pursue targets or a single mage that'll hang back and fire off spells, to stranger options such as a jellyfish that floats about and spews poison at foes. Of course, there are restrictions around summoning them, as Spirit Ashes can only be used in specific locations and only once per life. They're also susceptible to being killed by more powerful enemies, making them better equipped for pulling aggro than securing victories.These kinds of thoughtful tweaks extend to the checkpointing system, which is a little more lenient to accommodate the open nature of the game. Instead of being returned to a Site of Grace when killed, the open world is littered with small statues called Stakes of Marika. These can usually be found around particularly challenging areas, whether that's because there's a group of enemies in a fortified location or a singular mini-boss that must be faced in one of the many heart-pounding, soul-crushing, and utterly confidence-destroying encounters. This might sound like something that makes the game easier, and not having to fight your way through corridors and trap-filled dungeons like previous Soulsborne games certainly makes the repetition smoother and more approachable, but it's more of a necessity for taking out the frustration of having to travel large distances in an open world. The challenges the Stakes of Marika precede are no less forgiving.That delicate orchestration of highs and lows and the build-up and release of tension that From Software has mastered, coupled with the thrill of freeform exploration and discovery, is an intoxicating cocktail of game designElden Ring is undoubtedly difficult--much harder than any of From Software's previous games. And while a great deal of that is owed to challenging bosses and enemies, a significant amount is also because of the freedom the game offers the player. It doesn't tell you where to go in any way, so it can be very easy to find yourself in places that are too difficult for you to navigate. It won't stop you from riding to Caelid, a region that looks like it's ripped straight out of Bloodborne, or Caria Manor, a place with enemies so unsettling they made me leap out of my seat in a panic. Instead, it trusts you to assess the situation and consider your own capabilities both as a player and a character, then decide if you should return to a place that is more manageable and continue building your character up to come back later.Some, like me, will fall hopelessly in love with the thrill of blindly wandering into a corner of the map and being ruthlessly murdered for hours on end, just to walk away with little more than the satisfaction that I kept picking myself up and eventually emerged victorious, albeit battered and bruised. Others, however, will find the idea of navigating a perilous catacomb down to its deepest depths while braving all manner of horrifying creatures for a few measly crafting materials to be the epitome of unrewarding. But, either way, there's a boldness to the approach that deserves to be respected.The Lands Between is no less content-rich than many of its open-world contemporaries, and it offers much to do. In fact, it's an immensely large game that is bursting with activities to undertake--so much so that by the 35-hour mark, I had defeated just two of the five Elden Lords. In the starting area of Limgrave alone, there are numerous caves, tunnels, ruins, catacombs, shacks, and encampments to find. You may be wandering the woods at night and hear distant howls of what sounds like a man imitating a wolf, or step upon a mysterious lift that plunges deep below the surface and emerges into an entire kingdom buried underground. You could find a forlorn merchant, hiding out in a remote church, or accidentally walk into the territory of a rampaging dragon. These may not always lead to meaningful progress in becoming an Elden Lord or advancing a key questline, but none of it felt superfluous or boring. That is because what these activities offer is far more meaningful: a gameplay loop that sparks a curiosity to uncover the secrets that the Lands Between hold, and the raw satisfaction of discovery.Discovering things to do is as intensely satisfying as doing them, and that is what Elden Ring is predicated upon. The same sense of growth and satisfaction that comes from conquering Lordran or becoming completely at home in Yharnam is present as you brave the Lands Between. What once struck fear into your heart becomes trivial as you venture deeper and spend runes to level up and grow stronger. It should come as no surprise that a From Software game isn't quick to dish out rewards and praise for tasks you undertake. Instead, the most valuable rewards are intangible and internal: a sense of personal growth that comes from your mastery of mechanics and domination of the world's vicious denizens, or the feeling of journeying through this inhospitable land as a cartographer, poking into its various nooks and crannies, and seeing what lurks there.There are countless moments that will catch you off-guard and fuel that desire to explore. On one occasion, I traveled to a remote shack where a Warmaster had taken up residence. He had always been there, but this was my first time visiting at night. He wasn't in the shack, and when I approached it a cloud of red appeared and from within it a knight menacingly stepped out to do battle. He proceeded to wipe the floor with me, but considering he was telekinetically wielding a large spectral blade, I'd say he had a bit of an advantage.On another occasion, I mounted my spectral steed, Torrent, and bounded through an area I had been to numerous times, except this time a gargantuan baby bird that had rotted down to its skeleton descended from above, knocking me off my mount and cornering me in battle. In these moments, and many others like it, my mind raced with possibilities: With a world as vast as the Lands Between that shifts dramatically depending on the time of day, what else was out there for me to see? Elden Ring is a game where the possibilities feel endless and I felt driven to chase them all down, as each one has offered a memorable moment and made the world feel richer.Freeform exploration isn't completely new and the proverbial elephant in the room in that regard is The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. It's easy to draw comparisons between Elden Ring and Nintendo's acclaimed open-world Zelda, but what sets the two apart is a greater sense of authorship around the things you can stumble upon in the Lands Between and an overall cohesion between the open world and these activities. Elden Ring is seamless, whether you're delving into a cliffside cave or breaching a massive castle front, and in spite of the vast diversity among these locations. Although there are occasional breaks to make a transition, these are just for a few specific set-piece locations that are elaborate dungeons with ambitious design ideas--think of it as going from Hemwick Charnel Lane to Cainhurst Castle in Bloodborne.While the open world represents a newer Soulsborne gameplay experience that prioritizes freedom and player agency, there are also numerous key locations that are more in line with the enclosed, directed areas of previous games. Stormvale Castle, Redmane Castle, and Raya Lucaria, among others, are where From Software continues to do what it does best: create visually arresting locations that are intricately designed to loop and weave in on themselves in a way that makes navigating through them as joyous as it is perilous. Each of the key locations in the game has a distinct atmosphere, aesthetic, and vibe, and I found it impossible not to marvel at the craftsmanship on show. This is the kind of game where you have to stop to see the sights, even when the sights are grotesque creatures that make you worry about the minds that created them.There are areas of Elden Ring's world that feel as genuinely terrifying as Bloodborne, like the aforementioned Caelid, where the river runs the color of copper, fissures erupt like bursting arteries, trees are shriveled and curled like the hands of an ancient witch, and a blood-red sky stretches out as far as the eye can see. But hop on Torrent and ride west to Limgrave and you'll realize that Lands Between isn't entirely a world on the brink of collapse with life about to be snuffed out. It's very much alive, and that much is evident from the verdant fields, bustling wildlife, and picturesque vistas. If you're in the right place at the right time, you might even find yourself in a moment of serenity as the light of morning dawn sweeps over a forest and the trees gently sway in the wind. The most impressive part of it all is how it coalesces in a single landmass that the player can travel across, despite the fact that each area looks and feels like it could be from an entirely different game. Needless to say, Elden Ring is a gorgeous game and a spectacular feast for the eyes.Much has been made of George R.R. Martin's involvement, but there's little in Elden Ring that stands out as having his fingerprints on it. From the characters to the narrative and the way it's delivered in broken pieces for the player to fill in the gaps, it's unmistakably Hidetaka Miyazaki and the From Software team--and it's all fascinating. To talk about it would be to deprive you and the larger Soulsborne community of one of the greatest joys of a new From Software game, so I won't do that, but it's safe to say that the expansive world, which Martin helped lay the foundation for, is filled with memorable characters. Some have mysterious motivations, while others have tragic fates and somber backstories. There are clashing ideologies, divine entities, and clandestine groups vying for power--all the pieces, and item descriptions, needed to supercharge the From Software lore video industrial complex are here. I have just a small grasp of everything going on, and I cannot wait for the larger community to get involved so we can piece it all together as a collective.While there is a unique kind of joy to be gained from carving a path through the Lands Between as a solitary adventurer, Elden Ring can also be played cooperatively. Like previous From Software games, the process of connecting with others is not as smooth as you might expect from a modern-day game, requiring players to jump through hoops such as being positioned in specific ways, using specific items to establish connections, and sticking to certain areas. It is undoubtedly convoluted, but when it works, it leads to some of the most memorable multiplayer experiences you can have, whether that's simply adventuring out in the world or summoning in someone to help defeat a challenging boss. The same sense of achievement derived from taking down a powerful foe is there when you team up with another person, as difficulty scales to account for multiple combatants, so it still feels like you're earning a victory.On the other hand, if you want to play the role of antagonist, you can invade other players' worlds and attempt to assassinate them. Souls games aren't often the first thing that come to mind when thinking of PvP experiences, but they have been the battlegrounds for thrilling brawls for some time now, and Elden Ring continues this tradition. The magic is in the fact that the game accommodates diverse builds, so you never quite know what weapon, armor, or ability an opponent may pull out. Fights are tense ballets of strafing, rolling, and striking that feel akin to a fighting game, and when you throw the game's remarkable vistas and punishing enemies into the mix, it can make for some truly memorable scenarios.In a genre that has become wrought with bloated and over-designed games, Elden Ring is defiantly contrarian in almost every way. Its commitment to design by subtraction and to placing the responsibility of charting a path through its world entirely on the player makes it stand head and shoulders above other open-world titles. Elden Ring takes the shards of what came before and forges them into something that will go down in history as one of the all-time greats: a triumph in design and creativity, and an open-world game that distinguishes itself for what it doesn't do as much as what it does.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"
Polygon,"Filed under:The open-world Dark Souls successor is staggering in breadth and challengeDemon’s Souls and Dark Souls game director Hidetaka Miyazaki has not taken comparisons of those games to The Legend of Zelda series with much joy. “I feel deeply unworthy of the comparison,” Miyazaki has said, calling the early Zelda games “monumental” works. But it is hard not to see the Zelda series’ influence, particularly the groundbreaking open-world adventure The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, on his company FromSoftware’s new game, Elden Ring.Nintendo’s 2017 Zelda game appears to have had a powerful, and overwhelmingly positive, impact on FromSoftware’s beloved style of action-RPG. Elden Ring is a deeply impressive adventure of incredible breadth and depth, blending From’s style of rich, challenging combat with exploration, discovery, and new levels of player freedom.Polygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences. When we award the Polygon Recommends badge, it’s because we believe the recipient is uniquely thought-provoking, entertaining, inventive, or fun — and worth fitting into your schedule. If you want curated lists of our favorite media, check out What to Play and What to Watch.It starts with the Tree Sentinel. This meaty, golden warrior sitting astride a powerful steed is the first thing you encounter in Elden Ring’s vast fantasy world, the Lands Between. He’s nigh-impossible to defeat in your weak starting state. But just behind him is a church in which to find refuge and supplies, and a bit farther, a castle to explore. Around you are woods with abundant natural resources, with which you can craft curative items. Elden Ring communicates quickly that your means of survival require exploration, learning, growth, and returning to face challenges, like the Tree Sentinel, when you’re physically and mentally ready for them.Anyone who’s ever faced down a Lynel in Breath of the Wild will know that process.Elden Ring is a clear continuation of Miyazaki’s Souls series, and it hits many of the same notes: A quiet, blank-slate warrior travels to a far-off, blighted land, where man and beast alike are cursed by some awesome power and cataclysmic event. And while Elden Ring starts its conversation with the player in ways familiar to anyone who’s played those renowned games, the conversation quickly changes only minutes into the game.The game’s massive map — and yes, there is an honest-to-goodness on-screen map this time — is only barely revealed to you at the beginning. But as you explore, on foot and on horseback, you find enemy encampments, castles, dungeons, catacombs, caravans of warriors, and the occasional friendly face. Every discovery in the world helps you grow stronger, either through experience or material rewards. In an easily accessible catacomb tucked away on a nearby cliffside, for instance, I discover an equippable talisman that restores precious health points when I land critical hits. In an enemy camp, I find a better shield that fully absorbs enemies’ strikes. At glowing saplings, I find Golden Seeds that add extra charges to my healing flasks. Every new power I discover makes taking on the next challenge a tiny bit easier.Many challenges in Elden Ring are monumentally difficult. Take Margit the Fell Omen, a twisted, stocky, stick-wielding warrior who appears to be in the painful process of becoming a tree. Facing him alone in the early hours of Elden Ring feels all but impossible. However, I can now summon a trio of ghostly wolves to aid me in battle, and enlist a powerful warrior in spirit form to fight alongside me. Neither makes Margit a cakewalk; boss battles in FromSoftware games are notoriously difficult — and Margit’s immediate successor is even more challenging — but Elden Ring gives me myriad tools to make myself just a bit more capable in tense situations. I can also visit a hub area, geographically unmoored from the Lands Between, called the Roundtable Hold, to strengthen my weapons of war even more. Forty-five hours into Elden Ring, I’ve defeated three of the game’s major bosses. They’ve granted me powerful runes, which I can temporarily use to empower my character. I also have a broad arsenal of weapons — swords, pikes, clubs, bows, even a rusted anchor — and magic at my disposal. I have learned healing spells and pyromancies. I can concoct deadly perfumes to poison my enemies. I can summon forth a ghostly jellyfish or a snakeman to fight for me. I can cook unsavory dishes made from mushrooms, animal livers, and wild fruits, which cure ailments or confer a temporary buff. Elden Ring’s toolset for growing more capable against daunting odds is deep and impressively varied — but it has not made me a god.Which is to say that FromSoftware’s signature high level of challenge remains intact in Elden Ring. Just as From has given me a deep well of tools I can use to tailor my play style, it has also compensated by deploying some of the hardest, most frustrating enemies it’s ever created. But I have found respite riding my steed Torrent through the game’s open-world areas, discovering caves and catacombs and wrecked little towns where I find even more tools with which to arm myself. I just learned how to summon a disembodied fire-breathing dragon head at the end of my arm, for example. And that feels great.The Lands Between is dotted with destinations both big and small. There are huge, mazelike castles to explore, yes, but there are also underground tunnels and mines where I can farm for materials and battle unique bosses of lesser difficulty. I’m measurably improving in the in-between moments before harder and harder boss battles. There is wonderful variety in the Lands Between, ranging from towering medieval fortresses to putrid, poison-flooded forts, from gorgeous autumnal landscapes to caverns carpeted with skinned corpses. One area of the game, a rotten, red-skied land called Caelid, is so grim and unsettling that merely existing in it felt exhausting. FromSoftware has raised the bar, once again, for miserable fantasy worlds.The Lands Between can be bleak to the point of depressing, but it can also be magical. Take, for instance, the mysterious four-legged walking cathedrals that clomp through plains and shallow lakes, ringing their bells for a purpose I have yet to discover. Like many oddities in Elden Ring’s vast world, these beings also represent a puzzle to solve — and should these self-contained tiny mysteries become too perplexing, there is often a merchant or helpful resident nearby who can sell me a clue. These people will also sometimes sell me recipes from which to craft new items, or offer a task to undertake for a reward. There are massive dragons, towering golems, and large sentient pots out in the open world, to be sure — but the smaller details work wonders. They feel less like crossing off a checklist, and more like new brushes of color for this impressively realized world.Elden Ring eschews traditional open-world video game bloat. There are no strict directives about where to go and what to do — merely suggestions and guidance from the Light of Grace at places of rest. Rarely will any character I meet in the world put a mission on my map or issue a demand. Instead, I fill in the details, discovering the castles and keeps for myself, marking new destinations and points of interest. Elden Ring encourages me to get lost and to make new discoveries on my own.The open world of the Lands Between is only lightly gated by progress. On Torrent’s back, I can go just about anywhere, anytime. And by using Sites of Grace —  Elden Ring’s version of Dark Souls bonfires — I can quickly move around the game’s continent in mere seconds.This movement is also shockingly convenient. Anytime I need to stock up on arrows or spend my current bank of Runes on a spell I might think I need, I simply pull up my map and teleport to my desired location. Likewise, anytime I find myself stuck on a particular problem — let’s say, for example, a damnable knight who can telekinetically throw his sword at me from across the room — I go do something else. There’s always something else to do.Elden Ring’s story is, like many FromSoftware games, opaque, and often tangential to the immediate action. Fantasy author George R.R. Martin, who contributed to the game’s lore, has done little to alter how From tells a story. It still comes across in short conversations, item descriptions, and in the very landscape itself. Almost everywhere you go is in some state of ruin; churches are destroyed, castles have been crumbled, and only the most powerful survivors thrive here. Martin does appear to have given Elden Ring a more grounded fictional basis in terms of familial relationships, a lust for power, and how the influence of that power has tremendous repercussions for the people they rule. But it’s hard to gauge the real impact of Martin’s contributions here, particularly since I have yet to finish the story, or stitch together its piecemeal lore. While the characters I’ve met in Elden Ring are more verbose than in past FromSoftware games, this is not a straightforward tale. Much of which is to say that if you’re coming to Elden Ring for Game of Thrones-style drama — a vast fantasy epic spread across a similarly vast open world — you will not be served that. Instead, you’ll get whispers of a wider narrative and a mostly clear mission: Slay everyone and become the Elden Lord yourself.Elden Ring is the natural next step for FromSoftware, which last delivered a huge fantasy world like this in Dark Souls 3. That game featured a sprawling, interconnected world, a vast armory, and an incredible amount to learn, wield, and discover. Elden Ring is that game amplified — it plucks the best from Bloodborne, with its compact, puzzlelike mini-dungeons, and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, which offered new levels of mobility and faster action.But, all told, FromSoftware has done more than just remix its earlier games and layer on open-world influence with Elden Ring. The studio’s conversation with the player goes in fascinating new directions, and there are great surprises here for longtime fans of Souls games; From clearly knows what we expect of its castles, its boss encounters, and the random out-of-nowhere ambushes, and it plays with those expectations. Sometimes it means I die unexpectedly. And sometimes it makes me smile. Elden Ring will be released Feb. 25 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.

Kotaku,"I spend too much time, at least for someone with only 33 years on his odometer, thinking about legacy. I find myself overly concerned with what I’ve accomplished and what I’ll leave behind, especially in comparison to other people—both successful and otherwise. As such, while playing FromSoftware’s Elden Ring over the last month, I couldn’t help but pore over studio president Hidetaka Miyazaki’s biography, if only to feel a little worse about myself.Miyazaki started his career in game development relatively late. But by the time he was 33, he was already working as director on Demon’s Souls, the PlayStation 3 classic that created the oft-imitated Souls-like pseudo-genre as an enduring facet of gaming history. Since then, Miyazaki’s established himself as the creative genius behind FromSoftware’s biggest projects, including Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and now Elden Ring, which released for every major gaming console (apart from Switch, which can’t typically handle such vast games) on February 25. I’ve since spent more than 90 hours journeying through Miyazaki’s sub-conscious, and let me tell you, it can be a pretty weird place.Elden Ring is an inevitable climax in Miyazaki’s legacy. It’s this massive, sprawling thing that borrows from, quite literally, every FromSoftware project that came before it. The game is (and I’m sorry in advance for saying so) Dark Souls meets Breath of the Wild. I barely know where I’m going or what I’m doing half the time, but the experience isn’t so unwieldy that it overwhelms with its many options and systems. Elden Ring mostly stays out of its own way, giving you the gentle nudges in the direction of cool stuff while also providing little resistance should you choose to forge your own path, a complete package neatly wrapped in the expected ambiguity of traditional FromSoftware design.I’ve long since made peace with the fact that reviewing Elden Ring—that is, providing an adequately thorough accounting of my time with the game—is nigh impossible, at least with my limited skillset. How do I make you feel the way I felt every time I encountered a merchant or enemy creating the most mournful diegetic music I’ve ever heard in a video game? What words can I use to bestow the same soothing nostalgia that rushed over me the first time I hit a wall with my weapon and it finally faded away to reveal a hidden path? How do I spell out the perfect onomatopoeia to capture my reflexive groan when I was ambushed by a nest of smoke-spewing basilisks, immediately aware of their dangers from encounters in previous Souls games?Everything in Elden Ring comes bundled with its own kind of friction, designed to rub you the wrong way until, finally, it rubs you the right way. And those rough edges cannot be sandpapered down without fundamentally changing the game’s entire raison d’être. Souls fans often make hay over the feeling of accomplishment that comes from overcoming the genre’s much-vaunted challenges, but it’s more than that. It’s like when my dad recently greased the hinges of an old screen door in my childhood home. The first time I opened it following his turn as a handyman, I fumbled with a brief weightlessness when I wasn’t greeted by the exact sound and sensation I expected. I heard nothing. I felt nothing. It was like I was in a void. All the texture, all the personality that door previously clutched in its creaking joints was gone, replaced by a whispery smoothness that hid its existence rather than adding flavor to the world.That’s Elden Ring without the learning curve, a process that sees FromSoftware essentially throw players into the deep end and encourage them to swim for safety. Could the user interface be a little more descriptive? I suppose so. Could the devs make a concerted effort to further evolve the combat mechanics past the clunkiness of its predecessors? Sure, anything is possible. But personally, I don’t want a game that plays like every other game—it helps that I get a perverse amount of satisfaction from Elden Ring’s repetitive die-retry-die loop, of course—and it’s refreshing to see FromSoftware stubbornly maintain its decades-old conventions. Akin to a project that eschews modern sensibilities like high-definition graphics and smoother frame rates to achieve a specific aesthetic, Elden Ring wouldn’t be such a worthy successor to the Souls lineage if it didn’t kindly ask players to modulate themselves to its eccentricities rather than the other way around.Mind you, Elden Ring isn’t the monster it and its predecessors are made out to be by diehards and detractors alike. The new, open-world structure feels like an intentional decision by FromSoftware to extend a fig leaf to folks who bounced off other Souls games, many of which were far more linear experiences than Elden Ring. Getting stuck on a boss in Dark Souls or Bloodborne, for instance, often meant slamming into the same brick wall over and over again until finally busting through bloody and bruised, whereas the Lands Between provide much more to see and do. Dozens of hours can be spent exploring the regions before the first major dungeon and its skill check of a boss, gathering loot and gaining levels until you’re overpowered enough to reduce Godrick the Grafted to a pile of amputated limbs with little effort. You can even skip the fortress entirely if you’ve decided you’ve had enough of his nonsense, a viable strategy for when you want to see what the rest of the game has to offer.At its heart, the beauty of Elden Ring is found not in its difficulty but the little things you do between the earth-shattering boss battles. It’s about exploring every shadow-filled nook and fog-obscured cranny of the environment in search of items you’ll never use. It’s about spinning the camera just right to peek around corners and over precipitous ledges for hidden dangers. It’s about clambering into coffins that deliver you up and over underground waterfalls to caverns long forgotten by time and inhabited by eldritch creatures from beyond the stars. It’s about scaling the crags of a dead, impossibly massive dragon or the giant offshoots of a golden tree, both of which have so integrated themselves to the structures of a decaying capital city that, for centuries before your arrival, they’ve become more architecture than biology.Elden Ring manages to pull off the miraculous feat of making you feel small yet still able to affect tectonic shifts on the world around you.As one of the Tarnished, a group of “chosen” “undead” returning to a mythical world known as the Lands Between long after an unexplained exile, Elden Ring puts you in the position of both visitor and vaccine. The shattering of the eponymous phenomenon known as the Elden Ring resulted in the deaths of demi-gods and the dissolution of great kingdoms, leaving a huge mess for you to set right in various ways upon your arrival. Like the more desolate settings of previous Souls games, the Lands Between is a shadow of its former self, and the miserable few that remain to pick through the rubble seem to do so out of a sense of momentum rather than a concerted effort to put the pieces back together. Life doesn’t find a way to endure in Elden Ring so much as it limps forward with its eyes glued to the ground, unable to cope with the end of the world.The best way I can describe exploring a Souls game like Elden Ring is to compare it to buying or renting a used role-playing game in the era of the cartridge. Back before progress was saved on consoles, memory cards, or magical cloud servers, playing a previously owned game meant coming face-to-face with someone else’s history. And while this mostly resulted in a few boring minutes spent wiping the cartridge’s internal memory, sometimes it provided you with the perfect opportunity to experience the end of the adventure before taking your own first steps. After paying way too much for a boxless copy of Super Mario RPG as a kid, for instance, exploring a completed save and seeing how characters reacted to the final boss’ defeat was like visiting a museum in an alternate dimension. The Mushroom Kingdom had moved on and I was merely a tourist wrapped in the digital skin of someone they used to know.""Great things happen when George R. R. Martin finishes a project.""Open-world Souls-likeRidiculous freedom, solid combat, incredible characters and storylines, mind-bending lore. It's a Souls game, folks.Frequently reused bosses, no photo mode, creativity seemed to sputter out near the end.FromSoftwarePlayStation 4, PlayStation 5 (played), Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PCFebruary 25, 202290+ hours to complete most side quests en route to the ending.This extends past story and setting into gameplay as well. Where a fresh save file in most games may beset you with tutorial pop-up after tutorial pop-up to slowly acclimate you to its challenges, Elden Ring’s lived-in world largely treats you like you’ve been here before. Sure, there’s an easily missed primer that teaches you the basics, but for the most part, it’s up to you to learn the game’s unique visual language.Swirling airborne flecks of gold sparkles indicate the presence of semi-hidden checkpoints. Statues of hunched-over old men point the way towards catacomb-like dungeons. Magically animated rock piles mean an alternate dimension prison cell containing a mini-boss is somewhere nearby. Elden Ring does this so effortlessly and at such a microscopic scale that you’ll recognize yourself recognizing the telegraphed body language of even the least dangerous enemies and formulating counters without an inkling of when exactly you gleaned that info.Other critics have described Elden Ring as slapstick, a sort of Arthurian legend meets Looney Tunes situation that births increasingly hilarious moments despite the game’s serious trappings. And much like allowing your brain to take a breather while you laugh at Johnny Knoxville getting kicked in the nuts, giving yourself permission to adopt the right mindset is the first step to truly appreciating what Elden Ring offers.Accept that the game won’t always play fair. Accept that its huge input buffer will more than once make you take a swig of a healing potion when you really meant to dodge. Accept that you’ll probably get your ass kicked the minute you step outside the starting area because you, wearing only a loincloth and wielding a small club, dared to take on the swole mounted knight in the gloriously gleaming armor. Accept Elden Ring for what it is, for what FromSoftware set out to accomplish, and don’t get hung up on what it’s not. I promise that 90 percent of you will have a much better time with the game if you do. And for the other 10 percent, well, that’s okay too.I say this compassionately and without an ounce of elitism in my heart: A work of art isn’t always meant for everyone.Elden Ring is a love letter that may as well be written in a dead language for those unable or unwilling to bend themselves to its will. While certainly not as inscrutable as King’s Field, unforgiving as Dark Souls, or mechanically complex as Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, the latest FromSoftware project still asks players to put up with a lot of frustration. But if they do, what they’ll find in Elden Ring is a fitting culmination to director Hidetaka Miyazaki’s decades of world-building expertise. My lengthy sabbatical in the Lands Between revealed to me a game that was as much in love with giving you something new and weird to see around every corner of its massive open world as it is with the sound of its own voice. Seriously, sentient iron balls? Giant hand monsters? A necrophiliac named Dung Eater? FromSoftware needs to chill.Like most great works, Elden Ring is magnificently flawed, equal parts beautiful and ostentatious. In this age of cookie-cutter, paint-by-numbers, triple-A development, what more can you ask for than something wholly confident in its bullshit? Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m only about one-third of the way through the game and would love to see at least one of its multiple endings sometime this year. "
Destructoid,"darkIt’s time for another From Software game! Gather around as we talk about Elden Ring, which needs no introduction.I’ll get this out of the way: Elden Ring is possibly my favorite From Software game yet. I’m going to have to simmer on this (I’m on my second playthrough now) for years to come, but it’s looking really good based on a full completion and change. Let’s dig into this monstrous adventure.Elden Ring (PC, PS4, PS5 [reviewed], Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S] Developer: From Software Publisher: Bandai Namco Released: February 25, 2022 MSRP: $59.99One of the biggest selling points of Elden Ring is that it has an actually engaging open world. So many open games have become bloated messes, mere parodies of the genre, in recent years. Pins upon pins upon pins, with tie-ins and companion apps; it’s ridiculous in some cases. But Elden Ring feels fully complete, in the sense that discovery is paramount before reaching marked destinations for small dopamine hits. I constantly found myself looking off in the distance, and becoming fixed with finding out how to get somewhere. The EldenSekiSoulsBorne (coined!) spirit is alive and well.Dead bodies in ornate chairs and the hubris of royalty is still a mood: and a unique one in the landscape of games. While the story is still very low key at times, I enjoyed the effort to pack in more lore via textual ruins, as it’s way easier to piece things together that are actually in the game, and not in an interview or wiki. I honestly couldn’t tell you which parts feel like they were touched by George R. R. Martin, but having read through all of the Game of Thrones book series, that’s fine with me. Miyazaki and company have been doing just fine on their own so far, and Elden Ring continues that trend.It’s also true to form in other ways. Small caves leading to big areas is a big part of Elden Ring‘s DNA: caves you may miss entirely on your first playthrough. But there are also super obvious landmarks to visit in an organic way by simply coming across them. As you start to weave together routes, locations of secret merchants, and far away points of interest, the game really comes alive. Running into a convoy of enemies and figuring out how (or where) to approach them is a unique thrill that’s inherent to From Software games, but feels bigger in scope because of the fabric in which Elden Ring is comprised.The series has undergone some changes, mostly for the better, in the quality-of-life department. At one point I had wandered around the map for a while without checking the navigation screen, stumbled into a tomb, got ambushed, and died. When I was prompted to resurrect, I had the option to head to a checkpoint called a Stake of Marika (presumably near that tomb), or the last site of grace [bonfire]. I chose the former, found myself very close to my body, and got my runes [souls in other games; currency you use to level up or buy things] back I had lost. Some may call parts of Elden Ring “easier” on paper, but I just see it as convenient.It doesn’t feel easier, at least. The “marking where you need to go” bread crumb mechanic, which was announced around when the game was revealed, isn’t even that descriptive. While NPCs do give you vague hints of what area to go to and glowing arrows point to places of interest, not all of them are going to be story/critical path locations. On one occasion, I spent a few hours trekking through an area with a marker that turned out to be completely optional.Because the game is so big, and things can feel so aimless, adding a convenient mount on top of the other quality-of-life features is a genius move, because Elden Ring wouldn’t work nearly as well if it was more rigid. Instant fast travel is a Godsend, especially for quests that ask you to immediately about-face and head back down the same path you just ran through. Testing it out on a PS5 made this process even smoother, as loads were near-instant. The technical and design advancements actively encourage more exploration without the contrivances. The Stakes of Marika, which function as little “checkpoint” fires for (many, but not all) boss fights make repeat attempts more fun/quicker too.Galloping around on a horse and jumping are two small things that I take for granted in a lot of other games, but here, they’re even more appreciated. It’s really addicting, meandering about the map, and trying to jump up to get a better view of everything. Again, it’s all organic. When exploring, I would often use higher ground to find a legitimately cool-looking or interesting area, mark it on the map, then go to it. It’s not too gamey or cynical. No joke, I spent hours roaming around in between “story bosses.” And you know what? It even has a low key marker/stamp system to draw in your own personal map: and I didn’t even find the option to trigger stamps until my second playthrough (just the light-ray objective markers, which are limited).The map is far bigger than expected, going beyond the limits of what the screen shows you at first. You’re constantly coming across new stuff, because exploration is so expansive. So there are some gates (think keys you need to get into specific areas), but by and large you can explore nearly the entire map. Finishing a “story” boss will lead you to the next area by default, or you can sometimes sneak there using a hidden path and sequence break (to a point). If you’re worried about a lack of “traditional” areas: don’t be. There are plenty of massive, deliberate zones just like the old games. That said, some of the open world stuff isn’t as exciting as I’d like.Micro-dungeons can get derivative, much like the Chalice layouts in Bloodborne. There’s tiers of said dungeons, from “ruins” (which are glorified treasure chests), to dungeons (think chalice), to caves (usually with weapon-enhancing materials), and so on. Some of them are a cut above and more clever with unique layouts and puzzles, but those are typically found near the end of the game. There is, however, a very cool take on subterranean map design (that I won’t spoil here) that makes up for it.When I was at the foot of the final boss, I went back and found 15 hours of more stuff to do, and didn’t exhaust it all. The “40-hours-or-more” mark for a first playthrough is roughly what a lot of people are looking at, erring on the side of “more.” In fact, on my second playthrough, I found at least 10 things I hadn’t done before in the first five hours of that next go-around. The scope should encourage multiple playthroughs more than any past From Software title.And yet, the open world changes nothing in terms of the heart and soul of Elden Ring. A miniboss can still pop out and wreck you harder than the required boss you’re on your way to fight. NPCs can die due to unforeseen story machinations. Some of you are probably thinking “that’s stupid that this is still around.” The Souls fans out there are rubbing their hands together in excitement.We do this discourse every time From Software releases something. It’s occasionally frustrating, but always exciting and unpredictable for a large group of people: myself included. I’m still thinking about a few of the game’s puzzles, and even took physical notes this time because of how much there was to track.Combat gets a lift from a more open loadout system. Mixing and matching playstyles and weapon types is super easy, and making your own potion to suit your needs (using a combination of two effects, which you’ll pick up throughout the game by killing tree guardians) is peak Elden Ring customization. From a mechanical perspective, most of the weapon types feel precise, and on a PS5, I had no real technical complaints. There are too many individual facets to talk about, but the amount of freedom I felt was overwhelming at times. Instead of just pumping stats into a character like so many other lite RPGs, I put some actual thought into how I wanted to approach everything. That includes weapon modification, what abilities to imbue, and what armor pieces to wear.Summoning NPCs as a magic spell (instead of through some laborious one-off sigil you might need to wait for or never find) is an insane upgrade for solo players both now and forever, as long as the game exists and servers become less populated. Crafting, while rote in many games, feels natural here, because the items you can craft actually matter to some builds, or you can ignore it entirely.A fully-fledged multiplayer component, which has everything from PVP to PVE in one place, could ensure that Elden Ring‘s legacy will live on as long as most of the other Souls games have. Again, it’s a long time coming, but it came all the same.So many challenges are optional that it not only funnels into that aforementioned genuine sense of discovery, but it also feels like you can choose how difficult you want the game to be. Sure, there are roadblocks in the sense that critical path encounters lead to new areas, potentially new items/upgrades, and better places to farm/level-up. Some of those gates are going to be annoying if you want a constant sense of story progression. I even felt the pang of linearity near the end of the game as things were wrapping up and funneling into a pointed series of boss fights.Given how much Elden Ring encourages you to sit back and enjoy it, it was never truly an issue for me, because I could take a break and go explore somewhere else. It also doesn’t sacrifice the core Souls loop of overcoming challenges and the sense of accomplishment that hits you like a ton of bricks afterward. Yes, that setup isn’t for everyone. But I also think that Elden Ring is one of the most accessible From offerings yet from a skill floor perspective, while catering to everyone who has been along for the ride this whole time (the ceiling can get high still).To say I was blown away by Elden Ring is an understatement. Sure it’s still going to appear esoteric and unapproachable to a subset of people. There are things it could still do better in terms of onboarding, and it could do even more on the front of quality-of-life enhancements for returning Souls players.But as an experience, it’s one of the most wondrous and open-ended games I’ve played in years. It has so much to say from a design perspective that people will be talking about its choices for years on end, and playing it for longer.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]Essential10s aren't perfect, since nothing is, but they come as close as you could get in a given genre. The new leader to beat in its sector, we're talking pure ecstasy.

Elden Ring is one of the most anticipated games of all time. Since the reveal trailer was first shown at E3 2019, every little morsel of info about the game has made headlines. George R.R. Martin’s worldbuilding and Hidetaka Miyazaki’s writing and direction seemed like a match made in heaven, and fans have been on pins and needles to see if the end product can live up to their lofty expectations.It does.Elden Ring takes all the experience FromSoftware gained from creating the Souls series and adds to it to make one of the best open-world games ever made.Like past FromSoftware games, the lore in Elden Ring is complex and veiled. However, I will say the plot here is less opaque than it was in previous games, but you still have to do some digging to get at the full story. I’ll give a (very loose) rundown, but since part of it is gleaned from reading between the lines and piecing together snippets of conversations, I’m not even sure I have the whole picture.Long ago, the Lands Between was ruled by Queen Marika and her King Consort, the Elden Lord Godwyn the Golden. They commanded the power of the Elden Ring, and through it and the blessing of the great Erdtree, they forged a kingdom and ruled it in peace. For a time, things were idyllic (or at least not terrible), but dark forces conspired to upset the balance by stealing the Death Rune from the Elden Ring. As a result, the Elden Ring split into six Great Runes and came into the possession of the six leaders who ruled the six realms of the Lands Between.With the Elden Ring split, things get a bit wonky. The six Great Runes are incredibly powerful but corrupt those who use them. So, the six leaders became Demigods, but also became demented, and thus started the Shattering. The Demigods warned against one another, tearing the Lands Between asunder. However, none won a decisive victory and remain locked in a stalemate. Unfortunately, the crazed leaders killed almost all of the citizenry in the conflict, but with the Death Rune no longer in place, they are born again into miserable servitude to their twisted lords.You play as a Tarnished, a person (or descendant of one) who “lost the grace of the Erdtree” and was exiled at some point in the past. Grace (the name for the power that stems from the Erdtree) has called the Tarnished home in the hopes that one of them can gather the Great Runes, reforge the Elden Ring, and restore order as the new Elden Lord.All in all, it’s a sorrowful story since most of the participants didn’t choose their lot in life. The Lands Between is full of fallen heroes and victims of perpetual war. The remaining living humans are shellshocked and often half-crazed. It’s a depressing atmosphere, but there is hope, and not every story here ends in tragedy.The world of Elden Ring is an absolute marvel. This is one of the rare cases where a studio has really undersold both the scope and the quality of an open world. When I got the first piece of the map showing Limgrave and Stormveil Castle, I thought it must have been around 1/4 to 1/3 of the explorable territory. After all, Hidetaka Miyazaki himself estimated it would take approximately 30 hours to complete the game. I had only beaten the first of six Demigods at the 30-hour mark.The world map is huge, but it’s far from empty space. It’s packed with dungeons, mines, barrows, ruins, castles, camps, villages, forests, chasms, and all sorts of nooks and crannies to explore. In addition, there are quite a few “legacy dungeons” to explore that follow the traditional Souls format. These range in size from medium (places that hold a valuable item) to large (areas that usually contain a Demigod) and should sate any fan of the genre.If I had to compare the Lands Between to any other open world, it would be Breath of the Wild’s. There’s so much to do and see here, and few games capture the raw feeling of exploration like Elden Ring does. I’m still far from experiencing everything the game has to offer, and I estimate you could put well over 120 hours into it and still not have discovered everything.The important thing about the open-world in Elden Ring is how relevant it is for players to explore. This is a challenging game, and each optional place you visit gives you more items, gear, and Runes, which increases your survivability. There’s no list to check off here or baubles to collect, just ammunition against the overwhelming odds you have to face.The conversation about difficulty is a hallmark of Souls games, and people are chomping at the bit on all sides for the game to release to critique how easy or hard it is. I thought the game was easier than previous FromSoftware titles, but it’s not because it has been toned down in any way. It’s no less challenging; it’s just that you have more options available when confronting a situation.A lot of the frustration that people have with the Dark Souls series is that they’re relatively linear and that if you get stuck, you often have to keep throwing yourself against a situation until you manage to overcome it. Sure, you can go farm for XP or items or try another path, but you’re very limited in your options.In Elden Ring, whenever I ran into a boss I just couldn’t take down after the first few tries, I left and explored. Typically, I’d clear a few areas, find some upgrade materials and a new item or two, and then head back and take the boss out. Since every Site of Grace (bonfire) acts as a fast travel point, you can quickly dip out and take a breather if you start getting frustrated.Some FromSoftware fans will feel like Elden Ring goes too far to help the player out. However, I think this design is what might finally make this genre mainstream. It gives players a chance to take a step back, improve their character, get some more combat under their belt, and attempt a fight again renewed.I played Elden Ring on PC, and it’s a gorgeous game in 4K. However, I imagine mid-range PCs will struggle with it. Even with my hardware, I would get microstutter every once in a while. The odd thing is, it didn’t matter if I stayed at 4K or dropped down to 1440p; they still happened. Turning Resizable Bar on seemed to help a bit, but that might have been a placebo.My (admittedly amateur) take is that the game seems to aggressively pre-load each area. As a result, there was zero noticeable pop-in, but even with a PCI-e 4.0 SSD, things seem to get bogged down. I’m fine with the microstutter because this is one of the first games I’ve played where you can see clear across the map without any fog or programming tricks. It was a great feeling to see some far-away place and then later in the game realize you were there. It gives a sense of scale that you don’t often see in the medium.Unfortunately, there’s no DLSS, RTX, or FidelityFX here. I’d love to see DLSS added at some point since it would likely help with texture streaming and maybe cut some of the microstutter.Unfortunately, I didn’t get a chance to check out the console version of the game, so I can’t speak to performance there. I can’t imagine it would run great on a base PS4 or Xbox One, so I suggest anyone reading this check out some console footage before purchasing it.Elden Ring is a tour de force and is maybe the only example of a studio underselling a title. It’s an M-rated Breath of the Wild, full of secrets, intrigue, and an enthralling world to explore. It’s a game that makes me excited about gaming, and it’s fantastic to see a highly anticipated title like this turn out so well.Games like Elden Ring only come once or twice in a generation and raise the bar on what the medium can offer. It’s challenging and unfair at times, but it also gives you the tools to overcome any of its obstacles, and those who persevere will get one of the most satisfying experiences in gaming.10Jason Faulkner is Evolve Media's Senior SEO Editor.

Forbes,"Elden RingThis may be the latest I’ve done a scored review of a game, but hey, life calls, and not only did I delay starting up Elden Ring due to Horizon Forbidden West and Destiny 2: The Witch Queen being released the same week, but I also…then had a child, so here we are! And as a new gamer dad, I have managed to work my way all the way through Elden Ring, against all odds.And I’m sure glad I did.Some context: I’m not a Soulsborne person. Not really. I bounced off the original Demon’s Souls back in the day and have never played any of the Dark Souls trilogy. I did play Bloodborne to its conclusion, however, so that prepped me a little bit I suppose, albeit that was years ago at this point.Elden Ring, despite being another FromSoftware game, is another animal entirely, however. It’s larger, longer and I would argue, much more accessible, despite its moments of extreme difficulty and potential for progress loss. And it is one of the best games I’ve played in several years, and is easily the best game I’ve seen released since the dawn of the PS5/Xbox Series X generation. I kind of expect that to stand for a few more years to come, and GOTY for 2022 seems like a lock at this point, especially after recent delays.For starters, the world that Elden Ring has created here, The Lands Between, is an achievement not just for the developer, but for the entire concept of open worlds in games. I have played so many open world games at this point that I am frankly exhausted from the concept, but Elden Ring changed all that with its exceptionally diverse, massive map that never stopped being interesting after 100 hours, and there’s probably 100 more worth of secret hunting you could extract from it in a single playthrough. While sure, we have our “biomes,” starter greenery, a swamp, an icy mountain, it never feels derivative and features some of the best scenic storytelling I’ve seen, on top of masterful level design that uses verticality, both above and below ground, in a way we rarely see in maps like this.Elden RingMy journey through The Lands Between was as a mage, casting spells first with a shield, then later with a set of Wolverine claws I had modified to let me teleport out of harm’s way. This is the first FromSoftware game where magic is not just an option, but a truly large part of the game, capable of multiple, powerful builds between Int, Faith, Arcane and weapons that use all three. Focused mainly on Int, I was slinging tracking meteorites and throwing icy moons at people by the end. I’m told Faith is probably the more interesting path to go down with more entertaining spells, but I still had a good time regardless.My build had me spamming spells while my summons, first skeletons, then a copy of myself, then a DPS maniac assassin, helped me out and got me through the toughest fights. You can overlevel for most of the content in the game if you do enough sidequests or rune farming, but eventually you will hit a point where it doesn’t matter, as the last third of the game kicks the difficulty into its final form, and no amount of power will save you. The game’s hardest boss, Malenia, will haunt my nightmares for years to come, and she’s already a video game legend (as is a real-life player you can summon to solo her).Combat is fun with any type of build, but where the game really shines is exploration. I cannot get over how truly dense this map is, where it lacks any real sort of indicators about where you should go and what you should do, but simply going anywhere, doing anything, will lead you to interesting locations, scenarios and treasures, and if you don’t explore enough, you can miss entire, massive chunks of a game, like an entire sprawling zone you can only reach if you get two halves of a single medallion from one NPC and one chest out of thousands.If I have any criticisms of Elden Ring it’s that perhaps sometimes it can be a little too obtuse. While I enjoy figuring things out for myself, there are many points in the game where it would be literally impossible not to break quests or miss endings or loot without looking up guides, and the longer the game goes, the more there is to miss. There’s “tricky” and there’s “accidentally completing one quest too early 70 hours ago completely breaks the chain of this entire zone,” requiring another full playthrough to get it right. There are too many instances like this, which is why I found myself looking up guides more and more as the game went on, as I felt like I would be ruining the game in spite of myself simply trying to figure it all out for my own.Elden RingThis is also not a game you’re going to play for its story. Yes, it has some memorable characters and wild cutscenes, but not many, and not often. You will have to do a lot of the heavy lifting yourself to read up on the lore of this world and what’s going on here in this space that George RR Martin himself helped created. While I like the mythology, mainly reading item descriptions and looking up YouTube lore videos is not what I’d call an ideal practice of video game storytelling.But again, in the grand scheme of things, these are minor instances, and in fact, reasons to give the game another playthrough with a new build and not missing all the stuff you know not to miss the second time. I don’t know if I have time for that any time soon, but I can see the benefit.Elden Ring is a stunning achievement from a literal video game architecture perspective, along with creating a difficult but not wildly punishing game that everyone, even non-Soulsborne devotees, should be able to enjoy. I have not been this impressed with an open world since Skyrim, and Elden Ring even surpasses that in many ways. It’s an easy game to recommend to anyone and everyone, and deserves the explosive sales success we’ve seen, dwarfing old FromSoft records. Elden Ring is a gaming achievement the likes of which we rarely seen, and you will be remiss to not pick it up and see what the hype is about for yourself.Score: 10/10Follow me on Twitter, YouTube, Facebook and Instagram.

Login NowElden Ring is FromSoftware's most ambitious title, acting as the culmination of 30 years' worth of practice, and delivering the best the genre has to offer.For a lot of players, the Soulsborne genre started with Demon’s Souls or Dark Souls, but both of those titles owe a lot to FromSoftware’s first game, King’s Field. Almost 30 years later, we have Elden Ring, the developer’s latest and most ambitious title. The game managed to hit every expectation I had for it, while still leaving me continually shocked and awestruck. It feels as though this is the genre’s final form, Hidetaka Miyazaki’s magnum opus.The story of Elden Ring is precisely what you might expect. The high fantasy world is a twisted and gnarled version of its former glory, as ruin has fallen upon the land. You are a Tarnished, an exiled person who has returned to the Lands Between to seek the Great Runes, the shards of the now-broken Elden Ring. Defeat the demigods who hold them and become the Elden Lord.But that is only part of the story and the main objective. The actual narrative and lore is as rich and interwoven as the community has come to anticipate, offering only the slightest insight into the world they’re exploring. Information can be gleaned from optional dialogue, reading item descriptions, and of course, looking at the environment and drawing your own conclusions.One of the big marketing pushes for the game was that George R. R. Martin was involved in the creation of the game’s backstory, setting the foundation on which the current-day story unfolds. While I could not definitely point to an element and say “This is clearly Martin’s work,” the underlying narrative feels far grander than what has come before. It is positively dripping with mythology and legends that will no doubt be investigated by lore aficionados.The sense of discovery and clarifying moments of the story are as impactful as they’ve ever been in the Soulsborne series of games. Elements of the world are slowly revealed, adding layers of knowledge while simultaneously shirking expectations.Like previous titles, NPCs make up a large portion of the storytelling effort. These characters have their own goals and often request your assistance. And like the games that came before, the player will likely understand little but accept all requests, if only to see what happens next.It feels as though Elden Ring is FromSoftware’s original vision for the genre finally realized. Like all that came before were a series of stepping stones that the developers have been walking along in order to reach this point. Though the core gameplay on offer here is unchanged from the formula that was laid out with Demon’s Souls, it has been polished to a glistening sheen.The combat is brutal and precise, utilizing the health, stamina, and magic meters to guide the pacing of encounters, forcing you to juggle resources. For sorcerers, Soul Arrow-like spells return along with gravity-based attacks that draw in enemies or send out shockwaves. Melee fighters have a wealth of new options too. One short sword I discovered had a telekinesis-like Ashes of War move that sent the sword out a few feet, twisted like a screw, and returned.Speaking of Ashes of War, these are abilities that can be applied to your armaments, offering a sort of special attack or enhancement. These range from the classic kick and parry moves to ones that boost the damage of your next attack, infuse attacks with blood power, offer greater protection, and dozens more. Think of them like you would weapon arts, requiring activation during combat and sometimes consuming the Focus meter. Better yet, they can be taken off one armament and applied to another.As for Spirits, these are ghostly allies that you can summon to aid you in battle. Not anywhere near as powerful as an actual NPC summon, these are more like trash mobs that offer some distraction or just a bit of extra assistance. A personal favorite of mine is a jellyfish called Aurelia that uses a long-range poison attack.Weapons and Spirits can be upgraded using the series’ iconic smithing system whereby attack thresholds can only be overcome by collecting the stronger version of an upgrade material. Thankfully, weapon affinity and intrinsic elemental damage can be changed at no cost, allowing the you to switch between things like a Standard affinity, Quality affinity for stat-scaling damage and things like Fire and Frost damage.Ever since Dark Souls, the genre has been a quasi-open world experience. You could, in some instances, go to just about anywhere in the map at any time, provided you knew the path. Now, Elden Ring has fully embraced the open world format, allowing you to venture to the far corners of the world with the only obstacles being the challenges faced along the way.To aid in your exploration of the Lands Between is your steed, Torrent, which can be summoned instantly. Torrent is capable of double-jumping and using gusts of wind to leap great heights. The horse is also instrumental during some larger boss fights, where speed is key, allowing you to gallop in on horseback, swinging your sword as you go.Thankfully, Torrent is available right out of the gates, which alleviates any of the potential tedium that can come with exploring such a vast open world. Better yet, where other open world games falter with the content between the major locations, Elden Ring is positively packed with little moments and treats to discover.Quite often I would be galloping towards the next major landmark on the horizon, only to be distracted by a band of soldiers marching along the road or a major enemy defending a doorway in the side of a cliff. There are also classic open world tropes, cleverly disguised in a way that only FromSoftware can do. There are sorcerers’ towers dotted on the map, locked until you can solve their puzzle, which grants you access to the top where a reward awaits. There are also paintings to discover out in the world, and if you manage to find the area depicted, a treasure can be earned.Crafting is also a new addition, allowing you to gather resources from the land and enemies and combine them. These resources are used to craft things like arrows and bolts, coatings for weapons, and consumables to rid yourself of ailments or buff your stats. Other open world games should take heed, as Elden Ring does not bog you down when it comes to resource gathering. A simple tap of the button and the item is in your inventory, no arduous collecting animation, even allowing you to do so while galloping along on your horse.I was constantly in awe at the size and level of detail in the world’s construction. What I took to be a flat plateau when looking at the beautifully hand-drawn map was in fact a winding ravine full of foliage. Similarly, the world uses imagery that is unlike anything in a Soulsborne game to date. The environments are breathtaking and surreal, both horrifying with its monstrosities and grotesque oddities and beautiful with its stunning landscapes. It’s truly mesmerizing.Speaking of the map, it does eventually become dotted with icons that you discover, be it the bonfire-like Sites of Grace that act as fast travel points or icons of buildings, caves, and structures you find. Unlike other open world games, these don’t get crossed off or faded out once searched, so it’ll be up to you to remember where you’ve been.The scope of the world in Elden Ring left me absolutely floored. Just when I thought there was no new experience or new vista, my jaw would hit the floor as some incredible sight or devious surprise revealed itself. I underestimated what was on offer here. It’s a bigger and richer world than any of the other titles in FromSoftware’s illustrious catalog.FromSoftware has made a name for itself with its Soulsborne series of games. There’s a certain level of challenge that is expected and that remains true with Elden Ring. Though it isn’t as immediately difficult or a shock to the system as Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Elden Ring provided me with ample challenge in both boss fights and general exploration.As with all these titles, a boss that is difficult for one will be a breeze for another. But as with previous games, it’s possible to alleviate some of the difficulty by just dumping points into health. On top of this, thanks to the open world format, you can just choose to go elsewhere and try another area out. You might opt to completely circumvent the first boss, choosing to venture further north or even spend hours gathering resources to upgrade your equipment.But at some point, you will need to tackle the game’s more linear and claustrophobic locations. These areas highlight the impeccable level design the team at FromSoftware is capable of delivering. Corralling and defeating enemies as you leap over roofs (thanks to the handy jump button) in search of the next Site of Grace is a stressful experience, as is weighing up whether to push forward or return to the previous resting point to level up.The environment was also a form of challenge. Seeing a location in the distance, and musing how to reach it, provided a different sort of puzzle. More than once I would place a marker on the map and work my way there, only to realize it was either hundreds of feet down a ravine or up some seemingly unscalable cliff.These challenges can also be enhanced or reduced with the summoning of both NPC and real players. After the brief hiatus of multiplayer with Sekiro, it’s a joy to be able to dive once more into a rich Soulsborne title with allies or invade another player’s game to spread a little bit of mischief.Elden Ring is nearly a flawless experience, were it not for a few hiccups with the steed Torrent and some frame rate issues, likely due to dated hardware. As for the issues with the horse, there were a few times where upon trying to summon it, the horse would not appear but my character would float in mid-air until he “fell” to his death.On the hardware front, those with older PC setups beware: Elden Ring is a demanding beast. Even on medium settings, my NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti and AMD Ryzen 7 1700X 8 Core 3.4 GHz struggled at times, specifically when there were a lot of enemies or when the massive vistas were on-screen. In saying this, these faults were eclipsed by everything else on offer in Elden Ring.Simply put, Elden Ring is Miyazaki and FromSoftware’s magnum opus. It feels like the vision for the genre has reached its final form. Elden Ring is a meticulously crafted game, with a world begging to be explored and experienced. It is truly mesmerizing in its scope, an astonishing success and everything I had hoped it would be. Forget what you knew about the genre, the real Soulsborne starts here, with Elden Ring.This review is based on a Steam code provided by the publisher.

					Awesome + https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-BkrwO_Dck :) !!!!! Thank you so much for the replay, that is really good news!!! My body is ready for Friday!!!!!				
					The GPU in my living room is a 1070, hopefully I can get a good 60fps at 1440p on the OLED				
					Bro you should 100% pull a HDMI cable from your MEGA 3080 computer and use a wireless XBSX controller with Steam's  Big Screen mode!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-BkrwO_Dck :)

					Many had been wondering if Elden Ring would be the first game to capture everyone's imagination after Rocket Arena

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-BkrwO_Dck :) is all I can say! What resolution where you playing at with your 1080 Ti????  [ Q ] Can you run the game @ 1440p on Ultra and @ 60FPS? I have the same GPU, so I am really hoping you can if not I am fine with 1080p 60FPS Ultra. Thanks for the review \m/ :) \m/				
					Damn Sam you held it back from being a clear best of all time on Open Critic with this lowly 9/10. 				
					Same score PCGamer gave it. 				"
