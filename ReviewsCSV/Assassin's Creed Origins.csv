Link: Official SitePutting an end to the machinations of the corrupt inner circle of Egypt's ruling class is on hold for a bit: first I gotta help this peasant boy I met thirty seconds ago, whose ox cart was stolen by bandits. Priorities firmly in order, I circle the bandit camp on horseback, dismount, creep close, take aim with my bow at the nearest bandit, and fire. Actually, I fire and then take aim: I have a skill that allows me to control my arrows in midair and in slow-motion. My arrow sinks into the bandit's shoulder, and he spins around and spots me.The slow-motion feature of my bow skill doesn't just give me an advantage, it also allows me to see things I otherwise would have missed, such as what happens next. The bandit and I attack at the same time, me with my second arrow, him by throwing a fire bomb. My arrow and the bandit's lobbed grenade pass each other in midair. The bomb strikes the sand and explodes, the flame from the explosion lights my airborne missile on fire, and there's a satisfying fwoosh of my arrow igniting just before it hits him right between the eyes. The bandit drops, felled by a flaming arrow we created together.It's one my favorite moments in Assassin's Creed: Origins, a game packed with great moments thanks to a world of tools and systems that can be used together to deadly (and sometimes comic) effect. Some of these systems are new, some are from previous entries in the Creed series or other Ubisoft games, and they blend well, with the familiar feeling satisfying and the changes feeling refreshing. Origins is perhaps not as great as Assassin's Creed 2 or as invigorating as Black Flag, but it's damn close.Origins is a damn big game in an even bigger world.In Origins you play (most of the time) as Bayek, Egypt's last medjay (sort of a freelance cop, with a badge and everything), whose grim tale of personal revenge and earnest desire to right wrongs among the locals soon spreads into a quest to rid Egypt of corrupt, powerful, anonymous figures who operate behind the scenes. Bayek isn't just a warrior but also a detective: investigating and stalking his prey, first rooting out the true identities of these shadowy figures, then infiltrating their lairs and sanctums, and finally putting an assassin's blade through their necks. (And then having a lengthy conversation with them—this is Assassin's Creed, after all.) Bayek's quests take him from his small home village of Siwa to the great pantheons of Alexandria to the Nile Delta and beyond, and lets him rub shoulders with figures like Julius Caesar and Cleopatra.The Egypt of Origins is a stunningly lovely place and I spent a lot of time simply soaking in the sights. Some areas of the map are expansive barren deserts or open seas, and while seemingly desolate of quests they're still well worth exploring to discover their few curiosities and surprises. Towns and villages are bustling with citizens, farmers, workers, and soldiers. There's plenty of dangerous (and eventually tamable) wildlife from vicious crocs and hippos lurking in the Nile to lions and hyenas prowling the sand dunes and rocky hills to flamingos and egrets that take flight when you thunder past on horseback. The simulation in Origins doesn't go below surface level, but if not a living world it's at least a lively one. And wow, it's big. After 35 hours of play, when I'd completed the main quest, tackled tons of side quests, solved puzzles, collected treasures, killed scores of enemies, and done lots of free-form exploring, hunting, and looting, there were still entire darkened regions of the map I hadn't yet set foot in. Origins is a damn big game in an even bigger world.How the world is divided up isn't my favorite thing ever. It's MMO style, with different regions appropriate for different character levels. If you're level 8, and you cross a border from a region marked for levels 7-9 and into a region marked for level 17-20, well, nice knowing you. No matter your skills and gear, you simply can't take on an enemy too high above your own level: your attacks just won't do enough damage and their attacks will one-hit murderize you. This gives portions of the map a feeling of artificial difficulty, an open world where you're free to go anywhere but not really free to do anything, at least until you've leveled up. When you begin playing you can make a beeline for Giza's pyramids or Krocodilopolis: maybe you'll get there in one piece, or maybe you'll be insta-killed by a hyena that's 15 levels above you.While I don't care for that particular brand of world creation, I didn't feel stifled by it that often. There were always enough level-appropriate areas to visit, explore, quest, and fight in (plus revisiting a low-level area when you've grown far beyond it can make you feel like a living god, which is pretty satisfying). And for the first time in what feels like a long time for Ubisoft, the world is filled with things to do without going overboard and looking as if someone spilled an overflowing sack of icons on a map. There are plenty of distractions as you ride from quest to quest, and lots of diversions to come across while exploring, but it never feels bloated or over-stuffed with tasks that require you to hop off your camel every few feet or disrupt your progress with the distraction of endless collectibles.Assassin's Creed Origins is a heavyweight when it comes to system requirements. Your graphics card is still the most important factor, but the CPU will play a role, particularly with faster GPUs where it can become a bottleneck. AMD cards also struggle to hit higher framerates, even at lower quality settings. Check out our performance analysis for more details, including CPU scaling results.Here's what we found so far: On a Core i7-6700K (stock) with a GTX 980, we've been recording around 50% CPU utilization with occasional spikes to 75% or higher. With a GTX 1080 Ti, we're seeing closer to 70% CPU use, even with an i7-8700K. Ubisoft lists the minimum CPU as an i5-2400S, but bear in mind that's likely only going to get you 30-ish fps, not 60 fps.If you can meet the relatively high system requirements, though, Origins has been stable and easy to alt-tab in and out of. We've run into some small glitches and dialogue miscues, but haven't encountered any game-breaking or major bugs.By now, Ubisoft knows we love infiltrating camps, forts, and strongholds, and there are lots of them in Origins. Some are small outposts (one is literally just some guy's house), while others are massive fortresses or palaces with dozens of patrolling guards and several captains and commanders. Taking down a fort is pretty much always a blast: observing, sneaking, picking off guards one-by-one, and of course the enjoyable mad scramble on the occasions when stealth goes wrong. Throw in random variables like wild animals attacking or the unexpected arrival of a handful of passing soldiers or the onset of an eye-blotting sandstorm, and no two camp assaults feel quite alike.Helping you plot your incursions is your faithful pal, Senu, an ever-present eagle whose eyes you can look through as she circles overhead. A glance from Senu will tag enemies, animals, treasures, and infiltration points. Unlockable skills let you use Senu as a distraction, as she can harass enemies and even show you the future path of an enemy as they stroll through camp. Not only is Senu a fun and useful tool, she makes long journeys more enjoyable as you can look through her eyes for a beautiful and serene view of the landscape.Origins also has gladiator challenges, chariot races, several types of brief radiant quests, and a few arenas in which to fight armored, rampaging elephants, if that's your particular dream. One of my favorite activities is a quieter, calmer one: a series of papyrus scrolls, which act like treasure maps. First you have to find the scrolls themselves, then decipher a riddle which leads you to leveled loot somewhere else on the map. It's a fun activity that promotes exploration, and takes you to areas you may have overlooked otherwise. For those hoping for more Black Flag ship-to-ship combat, there is a bit, but only in a few self-contained sequences.Combat in Origins is based on dodging, blocking, and attacks of different speeds depending on the type of weapon you're using, complemented with unlockable skills. It can sometimes feel a bit mushy: dodging, in particular, can be finicky when you're locked onto enemies, and later in the game I became so reliant on a shield bash skill and a single charged strike that fights, while fun, became fairly identical. The new system could use some refining, but I wound up preferring its more methodical approach to previous Assassin's Creed animated combo moves.There's also a great series of enemies called the Phylakes: a handful of imposing and ridiculously powerful warriors who individually prowl the map looking for you. They've got massive health bars and brutally deadly weapons, and I found myself loving how unfairly difficult they are to beat. There I am, an unstoppable badass with magic weapons and improbable skills, riding triumphantly away from a fortress of soldiers I'd just easily slashed and stabbed my way through. Then I'd spot a Phylake approaching on the road ahead, and would be forced to slink off and hide in the bushes quietly until he had passed. The Phylakes are humbling, and being humbled occasionally is a good thing.At one point, when I was level 32, I encountered a level 20 Phylake. I cockily unequipped all my weapons, thinking how satisfying it would be to exact my revenge on one of these super-powered bastards with my bare fists. Uh, nope. He was still too tough. I had to switch back to blades halfway through the fight to finish him off.I had a few issues with the pacing of Origins' main questline. The first group of assassinations—including the introduction, tutorials, and early batch of side-missions—felt as if they blended together perfectly, ushering me on at just the right time and level. At times, however, the gap in suggested level between main quest missions felt a bit too wide, sometimes even during a single quest. I completed the first part of a main quest marked for level 25, and the second half of the quest was marked for level 28, but I hadn't advanced enough to feel like was achievable. So, I had to spend time scouring around for local side-missions and other activities to grind enough XP to continue, losing the flow of the quest in the meantime. Things evened out more with the last of the main quests, however, making it once again felt more like a smooth and even experience.I can't say it wasn't genuinely cool to witness the birth of the Assassins.The story has a couple laborious beats, and there are a few brief jumps to see how things are going in the future (I'm not a fan of the Abstergo crap), but Origins' plot is a good one with a few dabs of humor and heart. I only occasionally skipped through cutscenes, and I'm a legendary cut-scene skipper. Even for a cynic like me, witnessing the beginnings of the brotherhood was a bit of a thrill. Yes, the word ""creed"" is spoken weightily a few too many times (we get it) but I can't say it wasn't genuinely cool to witness the birth of the Assassins. Prequels are tough to pull off without them feeling clunky and overly referential, but the origin story mentioned in the title is handled pretty nicely.Naturally, once you've beaten the main quests you can continue exploring the world, and the biggest compliment I can give Origins is that I'd much rather be playing it than writing about it. It's a got a dazzling and beautiful setting, lots of enjoyable systems for mischief and mayhem, and has just the right amount of diversions and distractions to keep you busy without ever feeling like busywork. The extra year Ubisoft took with Origins didn't result in a completely new and novel experience, but it did provide one of the best games in the Assassin's Creed series.A brilliant setting, new systems, and familiar features blend together for a strong prequel to the Assassin's Creed series.Chris started playing PC games in the 1980s, started writing about them in the early 2000s, and (finally) started getting paid to write about them in the late 2000s.

Eurogamer,"Ankhs for the memories.We know quite a lot about what the Ancient Egyptians made of death. Their opinions regarding life, however, often seem more elusive. This could have posed something of a problem for Assassin's Creed: although my first thought of this series is always of death dropping down from on high as darkness suddenly swirls and engulfs, my second, more considered memory, is generally one of life - mad, rickety, often hilarious life. The teeming, thronging cities of civilisation, messy history wobbling forth in the form of crowds, of bystanders, of onlookers, of thieves and killers and victims. This life is sometimes buggy and precarious - in Assassin's Creed, you can sometimes have no face, just a grin and some floating eyeballs and yet you can still be alive - but there's always something of a cheerful miracle to it. These games bustle. They bustle with life.Perhaps this explains why the developers have been so canny with the dates as they take the series back into the ancient world. There's a moment early on in Origins where Bayek, the new hero, comes across some hieroglyphs. Hieroglyphs are an easy shorthand for antiquity when dropped into the 21st century; the interesting thing here is that they're a shorthand for antiquity to Bayek, too - he has to work a bit to remember how to read them. This, then, is Egypt as it was a mere 50 years before the birth of Christ. The rulers are of Greek lineage now. The Pyramids? They're already unfathomably old, limestone facades pockmarked and crumbling away in the corners, good for parkour but also a bit tatty and knackered. The huge statues of pharaohs that we see in museums these days, often missing an arm or a leg, are often already missing an arm and a leg here too. Sometimes Bayek will be the one to de-limb them.Opting for the reign of Ptolemy XIII means Ubisoft gets to have it both ways, in other words: you get the sheer scale of Egypt, but you also get the melancholy of its specific greatness receding into folk memory. You get the violence and confusion as a declining empire finds itself squeezed between powerful international players (you also get some rather timely stuff on the way a nation in decline will debase itself in bitterness and xenophobia) and you get tart sibling rivalry for the big chair, a brother and sister fighting it out in private and in public. Oh yes, and in the streets you get people worn down and sometimes driven towards darkness by the sheer weight of political, economic, and cultural uncertainty. You get moderns, in other words, and we already know intimately how moderns feel about life.Egypt does an awful lot for Origins. It gives the game a charming new lead in the form of Bayek, for starters. Bayek's a fiercely capable Medjay - a proud pharaonic militia, I gather, which means Bayek operates a bit like a sheriff and a bit like a general problem solver for the community. Early on in proceedings, Bayek's set on the path to vengeance when events in his home town leave him tracking down and killing a group of masked cultists who have dispersed across the land. It's grim stuff, but with Bayek as the lead, the game is able to walk a neat line between bloodletting and something a bit more, you know, cheerful. He is driven by death, but he cannot entirely set aside his love of life. (His wife Aya is even better, incidentally, a full-blown secret agent with mysterious alliances. As good as Bayek is, it's a shame she's not the lead.)More importantly Egypt also gives Bayek a brilliant new playground in which to hunt his targets and unravel his conspiracies. It's a reminder that, as the Assassin's games have crept closer to the present day, they have also grown increasingly fiddly. Before playing Origins I stepped back into Syndicate a little, and I was surprised at how messy it could be navigating those narrow lanes and how dull it got scampering up the bland brick faces of all those townhouses. Egypt is a return to the kind of landscape that gave the series its brilliantly streamlined parkour in the first place, the kind of landscape where this stuff makes sense. So parkour's back to a one-button affair here, and all the better for it, and it's a pleasure to watch Bayek move through the game, scrambling over simple shacks and climbing rickety lookout towers, sneaking through reeds and wheat fields, scaling the sheer sun-bleached walls of the giant temples that give a focal point to all but the smallest of villages, and perching on top of giant statuary - the body of a man, the head of a jackal perhaps: Anubis!Egypt has scale - the map by the end of the game is still dauntingly vast - but crucially it also has range. It has mountains and canyons where bandits have made their hideouts. It has cities, like Alexandria and Memphis, where broad bridges cross canals and the wonders of the world might lurk in the next open square. At times, Origins' urban sprawls can feel a bit too close to the ground-hugging settlements of the first Assassin's Holy Land, or even the Renaissance cities of the series' most successful outings, but then, in the middle act, Bayek arrives at Giza and the Egypt of the properly ancient ancients reasserts itself in ways that are far too good to spoil here.This Egyptian tale is not the only story being told, however. Syndicate arrived in 2015 and then, for once, there was no big budget Assassin's game released the following year. Origin is the result of a four-year development, and it's also unmistakably the series' response to a playerbase that had started to grow weary of the kind of incremental changes that an annual release cycle imposed - and of the silt of ritual and outdated design that had inevitably accrued. In a way, Assassin's was a bit like Ptolemaic Egypt, I guess: tired out and tethered to past glories, and encircled by powerful new rivals. (I doubt Ubisoft invited this comparison on purpose.)Origins has a handful of responses to all this. Firstly, it's completely overhauled the combat system, ditching the cludgy old scrums that relied on heavily-repeated animations and that favoured counters above all else, for a hit-box system that gives you a sword and a shield and a dodge and a parry. It makes for far more organic and engaging combat, as you dart about enemies slicing away with a light, quick attack and a heavier defence-breaker, and it encourages you to use more of the space around you as you move in and out of a fight, prioritising between a handful of enemy types who each pose their own threats.Origins ships with an in-game shop, which offers stuff like add-on packs and individual bits of gear, but also includes a suite of 'time-savers'. These range from lumps of Drachma, the in-game currency, to ability points (but not actual levels), crafting materials, and maps to the game's various secrets. All of this is paid for by Helix Credits, which you'll generally need to pay for with real-world money, although that part of the shop is not yet activated.What of loot boxes? In the game itself, a merchant known as the nomad moves around the map and sells something called a Helix Chest. Helix Chests contain a single randomised weapon or shield, and they cost 3000 Drachma by the looks of it (they do today at least, and I just bought two of them).Combat's further enlivened by a fully-fledged loot system, which sees enemies dropping new kinds of weapons and shields for you to pick through. This means you can swap out a breezy sickle sword for a heavy mace that is slow but devastating, or twin-blades that look a bit like the tools a plasterer uses but allow you to carve enemies up with a flurry of quick bursts if you can get close enough. (Bows are similarly varied: I had one that worked a bit like a semi-automatic, and another that fired five arrows at once in a shotgun-style spread.)All loot has its own stats, and the better pieces will have unique traits too. I got through a lot of the game with a sickle that had an increased chance of critical hits and also encouraged bleeding. I swapped it briefly for a cursed blade that did amazing damage, but took out two of the three chunks of my recharging health, so that one had to go.Loot can be bought and sold or broken down to scrap, and you can also pay at a blacksmith to have it improved at which point it gets a stat boost. It's all very nicely done, but it does serve as a reminder that Assassin's is getting further away from stealth as it ages, and is now far more comfortable with open confrontation. Sneaking is still supported, of course, and there are some areas in which you'll want to move slowly and carefully and avoid being seen, but fostering proper stealth in a game's design is a bit like trying to grow your own coriander: you don't just whack things in place and give them the opportunity to flourish, you have to go out of your way to encourage them, to nurture them. Stuff like Origins' new adrenaline system, which sees you building up a meter through the laying on of damage before you can unleash weapon-specific specials, suggests that the series has embraced a different kind of pleasure to the rarified and guilty joy offered by tracking someone for ten minutes and then offing them with an audacious leap from the rooftops at the exact moment that nobody is looking. While Origins' combat is very enjoyable, it may struggle to stand out from the crowd.The other big tweak comes in the form of a far more central role for the RPG-like levelling system that's been introduced of late. It seems to me that you can pick up XP far more regularly throughout the basic things you're doing in the game world than you could in Syndicate, although you still get it in bulk for completing missions. I suspect the team has let the levelling go to its head a little this time. All Assassin's games have grind, but this is the grindiest one I can remember, as Bayek vacuums up side-quests in order to meet the ever-advancing level criteria for the big story missions. Going in underleveled means higher-level enemies are going to give you a very hard time indeed, and if the level gap is too large, even a stealthy assassination from above won't do much to dent a baddy's health. Drop back too far, and you're going to face missions you just flat-out can't handle yet.On the plus side, this XP flows into a skill tree with three branches divided across Warrior, Hunter and Seer disciplines and filled with brilliant stuff like sleep darts, the ability to tame predator animals, and a neat ability that allows you to turn corpses into plague bombs. It also means that even the most focussed player is going to see more of the game's range as they're driven away from the main campaign to level up. The problem, though, is that when it comes to side quests the game doesn't actually have much range to speak of. Egypt lends a hand to a certain extent, of course, with stories of poisoned crocodile gods and dodgy embalmers, but Assassin's designers only have a handful of different mechanics to shuffle through. There are investigation sequences where you take in a scene and click on nearby icons until Bayek's solved the mystery. There are hunting sequences in which absolutely nobody's going to be truly happy until someone's been given a heron's feather or a set number of alligator's ears. There are camps to be looted, and occasionally someone to be escorted, and many missions then end with an assassination or a huge fight. Repeat.There is a lot of this stuff to do, which is absolutely great if you're after a return on your initial investment. The huge map is filled with targets to loot, garrisons that contain high-ranking officers to kill, animals to hunt to feed a rudimentary crafting system that improves your gear, and papyrus puzzles to locate and solve (these are excellent, incidentally: a riddle that will point you to a position on the map where a really nice treat is to be found). But all these things quickly grow rather samey, and even the most wayward of players will find that enforced levelling interruptions break the flow of the main campaign. Granted, it can be quite tricky to get a sense of how an Assassin's game should actually be played when you're reviewing it in three days rather than allowing yourself to dive in and out, as I suspect is actually intended, over the course of a lazy holiday. Even so, I worry Origins has allowed the new implementation of levelling to mess a little too much with the pace of things.All of which sounds quite negative, but in truth I really enjoyed a lot of Origins. The main campaign missions are often excellent, and the phenomenal thrill of exploring Egypt can return very suddenly when you round a dune and see a pyramid, or when Aya tells you to meet her outside the library in Alexandria and you realise - oh cripes - it's that library. The game's political factions are characterised in interesting ways, a nice fast mount - camel or horse, they're all basically the same - is never more than a whistle away, and it's wonderfully easy to have the simplest task interrupted by the unplanned arrival of crocodiles or hippos, or by setting yourself on fire when you really didn't mean to. Even the modern day strand to the narrative, which I will not spoil, is excellent, managing somehow to be both focused and gleefully gratuitous in terms of its fan-service. It's a reminder that the genius of Assassin's Creed is not just that it takes you back to the past, but that it takes you back to the past as Assassin's Creed would have it, which means it's a past littered with unnatural artefacts, a past in which the great secret societies were not just old men's drinking clubs, and a past in which Ubisoft is able to be highly partisan, in this case focusing in very clearly on the neglected role of women in history.Ultimately, though, there's an underlying threat eating away at much of this, and it's something that the Egyptians of Ptolemy's time would have been aware of in their own way, even though they would not have recognised its modern name, which is syncretism. Syncretism, and I hope I have this right, refers to the steady, inexorable blending of multiple religions into one - and while game design isn't a religion, it sometimes feels a bit like it is, particularly when you're in a Ubisoft open-worlder. And, oh man, just as Egypt in the years before the birth of Christ was surrounded by up-and-coming rivals with their up-and-coming gods, it can be hard to keep track of where Assassin's ends and other open-world games, many of them also made by Ubisoft, begin. A couple of examples: to accommodate the loot, Origins has borrowed Destiny's menu system, just as it's borrowed a kind of Xur figure. Bayek, meanwhile, gets the lay of the land before each mission by scoping it out with an eagle - upgradable by synchronising at towers, of course - that acts like a drone as it hovers and marks targets and can even be fitted out to harass them. At times, I can't remember what came from where, whether Origins is stealing the system in which a circle contracts as you hunt for targets from above, say, or whether it's using a system which it invented and someone else subsequently stole. Either way, everywhere you look in Origins you'll find things that you have done in other games, probably quite recently. And as these games converge, they all get a little more interchangeable, and a little blander.For now, what saves Origins is something else it shares with Egypt: its mad ambition and grandiosity. This is a vast game that plays out on an improbably huge and detailed canvas. Having finished the campaign I am more than aware of all the stuff I have missed. The camel races I neglected, the arena fighting that I didn't have the time for,  the chances, perhaps, that a truly hilarious bug is out there somewhere. (On the bug front, I had four crashes back to the PS4 home screen, a few facial glitches, and a moment where a heron flew by under the sand; annoying - except for the heron, which was a delight - but mild by the series' standard. Oh, and it does seem that whenever you fast travel to a new location, the nearby traffic has its equivalent of a cat's golden hour: horses race past at double speed and often plough into walls before trotting off, as if the world was unprepared for your arrival.)Last night I moved in on the final boss fight. Then, I moved past the final boss fight and into the most bizarre endgame I can imagine in a big budget affair. And it was bizarre because of the scale Ubisoft was willing to reach for, even now, the places it was willing to take me, even at the end of an adventure, and its sheer unwillingness to stop making improbably lavish new stuff. As dawn rose, I wondered whether this would ever end, and I realised that I didn't really want it to. Assassin's Creed remains a wonderfully foolhardy game in terms of its ambition and its generosity, even if it it is no longer quite as distinct as it once was.

Metro GameCentral,"A soft reboot for Assassin’s Creed seems to be just what was needed, but does this new game go far enough?Assassin’s Creed is a great idea for a video game, with the perfect excuse to create an infinite range of sequels that ensure at least some level of reinvention every time. But that idea has never been fully realised. The best entry is a decade old this year, and the last two were easily the worst. Ubisoft has realised there’s a problem though and have taken clear steps to try and fix it, but their solution is only a half measure.Like an obstinate patient, that refuses to take the full course of their medication, Assassin’s Creed Origins shows some surface improvement, but the underlying issues are left to fester. For the first time in a long while there was no new Assassin’s Creed last year, but a year off was never going to been enough. And although Origins is a better game than Assassin’s Creed Unity and Syndicate, it’s not by nearly as significant a margin as you might hope.Origins is set in Egypt during the time of Cleopatra – the furthest back in time the series has ever been – and sensibly keeps the modern day sequences to an absolute minimum. As the game starts there are few clues that this is actually a sci-fi game about relieving ancestral memories, as you take on the role of a sort of ancient Egyptian policeman named Bayek. In keeping with most previous Assassin’s Creed games he’s rather dull, and although not quite as humourless as past protagonists he lacks any real charisma.But at least Bayek seems to have been given an authentic accent, and although we admit we know relatively little about the period there seems to be a greater effort in general to make things more historically accurate. And while some may consider that an unimportant detail it does prove the old adage about truth being stranger than fiction, and the sheer alienness of exploring a world this far back in time is one of the game’s key appeals.Unfortunately, the plot almost instantly becomes an overcomplicated mess, and within a few hours we’d given up caring about anything other than who we had to assassinate next. It’s much more interesting to simply set off exploring the huge open world environment, which is something that the game encourages with a much looser structure that allows you full freedom to pick and choose which missions to tackle, and when.The three pillars of gameplay remain exactly the same as usual: stealth, melee combat, and parkour. The problem with Assassin’s Creed is none of these elements have ever been very good individually, with the stealth and combat having been dumbed down and simplified more and more over the years. The stealth still isn’t terribly complicated here, although at least it doesn’t actively restrict your movements as it used to. But this often backfires, as the game constantly gets confused as to whether you want to use or climb over ledges when creeping around.The combat is almost completely new, and seems to be influenced to some degree by Dark Souls. Not in terms of the difficulty, but the emphasis on blocks, parries, and dodges is immediately reminiscent. But the movement is much too fast and jittery, with Bayek moving around like some weightless ballet dancer. The lock-on system and camera also have real difficulty dealing with multiple enemies at once, which ends up making the combat feel clumsy, imprecise, and ultimately unsatisfying.Clumsy sums up the game’s movement system in general, and although the parkour is definitely an improvement on previous games there’s still very little grace or flow to your leaps and bounds. It is the most accomplished of the three main mechanics though, and does make getting around easier and more enjoyable than it has been. Especially as you have a pet hawk that you get to use exactly like a drone, to scout out areas in advance and tag targets.The new loot system also works well, but the wider attempts to position the game as an action role-player, which it never really was before, create another double-edged sword. There’s a sizeable skill tree that allows you to specialise in whatever you please, but the flipside of this is that many enemies and missions have a level requirement and if you don’t match up there’s nothing for it but to go away and start level-grinding.Alan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNew Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart bundle is £50 off reveals leakXbox will be less hands-off with Bethesda amid major reorganisationIn terms of graphics the landscapes are very impressive, although the human characters less so – probably because of how many can be around at once. The world’s size and sparse population immediately begs comparisons with Zelda: Breath Of The Wild, but Origins doesn’t have nearly as much to see and do and many areas are just as empty and barren as they first appear.Another problem is that the series is unable to shake its reputation for bugs and glitches. They’re not as show-stopping as before, but within the first five minutes we witnessed the artificial intelligence mindlessly running over civilians (and a donkey) with a camel and a simple jump onto a low fence ended with Bayek spinning round like a lighthouse beacon. As you can imagine it doesn’t stop there either, including issues with frame rate and texture pop-in.You can tell developer Ubisoft Montreal have been listening to all the complaints about the series and most of them are addressed in some way, but they’re either left half-fixed or replaced with a new system that’s almost as problematic. Origins is the best Assassin’s Creed game since Black Flag but that’s really not much of an achievement. And in a year such as this – with so many other, better games to choose from – such nominal improvement is just not enough.In Short: A missed opportunity to reinvent the Assassin’s Creed franchise, which offers only incremental improvement and too many old problems.Pros: The setting is very well realised, with impressive attention to historical detail. Plenty of content and the hawk is a lot of fun to use. Loser structure is definitely a benefit.Cons: Movement always feels clumsy and imprecise, especially in combat. Dull open world environment and story. Restrictive levelling system and far too many bugs.Score: 6/10

Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy.Assassin’s Creed Origins is a game of stories. Stories you’ll uncover in the depths of sandy tombs on fading parchment, stories straight from the mouths of Ancient Egyptians feeling cursed by their vengeful gods, and then bigger, infinitely sillier stories that you’ll remember on the way to real work the next day. How you were admiring the way the morning light sparkled on Lake Mareotis only to be set upon by a clan of cackling hyenas on the beach, when you managed to escape a tomb via an underwater passage but had barely taken a lungful of air before you were savagely attacked by hungry crocodiles. Or, potentially, the time you meant to switch to your sleep darts while hidden in a haycart but ended up popping up in the middle aiming your bow like a neon-covered target and having firebombs lobbed expertly at you by high level guards... Yes, it was a raging inferno in seconds, and no, I didn’t last long. I have a lot of stories and, while Anubis greets me at the end of some of them, others see Bayek and I riding into golden hued sunsets of Ancient Egypt to create more. More ridiculous adventures where hungry vultures circle, and cruel, masked gladiators race across the desert sands in chariot pursuit. Assassin’s Creed Origins might celebrate a whole decade of the franchise - insert joke about feeling old here - but a year off for the series means that this leap of faith into the Animus might just be the spinning 360° pinnacle of the series so far. You’re no stranger to sneaking around with your hood up, but the Creed has never felt anything like this. The forging of the Brotherhood means a violent redefining of what makes an Assassin’s Creed game and while you’re always going to know what you’re playing, the experience in store finally feels truly fresh. The combat system of yore has thankfully been buried alive in the desert (queuing patiently for its trip to the afterlife), tailing missions have died quietly without a fuss, and a map of pointless collectibles has had a rock tied to it and been sunk in the Nile without ceremony. What’s left is a slimmer, leaner Creed. No irritating bells and whistles, just the whole of Ancient Egypt as a richly woven tapestry of murderous RPG. Oh, and it’s huge.While Creed maps have seemed overwhelming before, they’ve got nothing on Egypt. Hit the map and you’ll have to zoom out for four seconds longer than usual and that’s before panning across endless different regions, each with their own distinct feel. This isn’t just a world of deserts, pyramids and palm trees. The impressive story campaign guides you through beautiful lush farmland, craggy mountains and Greek cities before leaving you to unwrap the rest of the world like a giant living hidden-blade wearing Christmas present. Origins has no qualms about delivering you to entire cities complete with Coliseums 80% of the way through your campaign, knowing full well you’ll be back for more once it’s all over. The sense of scale only escalates and, playing on Xbox One X, the visuals are nothing short of spectacular whether you’re watching the morning sun rise over seas of sand, or hurtling over the red rooftops of Alexandria, realising that the tiles underfoot sound just like Assassin’s Creed 2’s Florence.12 essential Assassin’s Creed Origins tips to know before you playEgypt then is going to eat you alive. Literally and figuratively. While the roaming wildlife creates constant moments of peril with relentless hunger and sharp teeth, just going in any direction will deliver something you had no idea you wanted to do. How about freeing the rebels trapped in this enemy camp? No? Oh I’ll just grab some leather for Far Cry-style bag upgrades… Oh wait, I’ve ended up jumping on a boat and rescuing a priceless bust from the bottom of a lake... The new quest system is dangerously involved. Gone are the flashing fetch missions of old. Egyptians need your help and while starting one quest might seem like something small, you might uncover a table of even more quests or end up a part of a series of missions that previous Assassin’s Creed games could have only dreamed of. Go everywhere, climb everything even if it doesn’t have handholds, dive everywhere. The open world gauntlets are off. Brilliant characters and genuinely emotional dialogue means you’ll feel your way through every part of Origins. While there’s a strong sense of humour running through Egypt - “why did it have to be snakes?” howls Bayek in one tomb - there’s true feeling at work here and the eternal presence of death manages to simultaneously be trivial as you cut down endless guards in inventive ways, and heart wrenching as you see its consequences in both the campaign and multi-layered side quests. Fine. I cried. Once. And you’ll know when. As Assassins go, Medjay Bayek is pleasantly unique. While there’s going to be no spoilers here, he and his wife Aya’s quest across Egypt has a surprising beating heart. Marriage in games isn’t known for its keeping both partners, y’know, alive but their scenes are a refreshingly mature, if murderous, approach to love that’s balanced slaying and playing. Equality is the order of the day here too. Aya is just one of Egypt’s women who effortlessly reinforce that the fairer sex is not to be trifled with. There are no damsels in Ancient Egypt and a few sly nods from Ubi are telling. “How could you trust a woman to do this job?” exclaims Julius Caesar at one stage. How indeed, Caesar…The levelling and abilities systems mean that while Bayek starts out weak and fighting for his life with a rusty blade, he gradually evolves into a hooded superhero. The choice of abilities is intimidating but spend points wisely and Origins evolves gradually around you. Group battles suddenly become less of a deadly brawl as you invest in a smoke screen, rooftop battles are instantly 300% more Hollywood when Bayek learns to push people off buildings with his shield and, if you’ve erred on the side of the predator bow, upgrading to be able to control your arrows turns Egypt into a murderous playground. No tailing missions, bonus slow motion, and remote control arrows should be on the poster. After 48 hours of play I was no longer a Medjay of Siwa, but a level 36 Assassin with far too many quests to do, a shield that put people to sleep when I blocked and a flaming sword. Go figure. Deftly implementing a Destiny 2-style colour scheme, the loot system is constantly rewarding. A wide range of deadly implements means you’ll always find something to make the most of the new combat system with. Dual swords are deadly up close and personal while a scepter or spear makes for ideal long ranged play. The combat itself took me a few hours to get used to after hammering a face button for 10 years but raising a shield and a heavier emphasis on dodge quickly becomes second nature and far more rewarding. Whether you’re jumping into the gladiator arena or taking on one of the uber boss Phylakes across the world, your style constantly has to change. Mega shields need to be smashed, giant hammers dodged, weak spots hit. This is no longer just a case of spamming the counter button and letting it do the hard work for you. Every finishing move is a gory full stop of victory, and you’ll always want to try new loots perks for size. Poison on hit? I don’t mind if I do…And then there are the tombs: the moments of history hidden under the sands, the secret passageways with sand running from the ceiling and scarabs scuttling over hidden entrances. With Sarah Schachner’s atmospheric score whispering in your ears, exploring the mystical realms of Origins is everything you wanted from an Ancient Egyptian Assassin’s. Puzzles, buried treasure, rooms full of mummified cats (?!), it’s all here if you go looking. ""Whenever Origins is getting too pretty to cope, all you need to do is tap both analogue sticks and you’ll be in Instagram heaven""And looking is the order of the day. Origins craves you to take in its views. While some areas will require you to hunt down hidden treasure, others will only ask you to find a place to rest where you can sit down and take in the view. Away from the killing, away from the endless fire from shattered oil jars, Assassin’s Creed Origins is the most beautiful game in a series of beautiful games. Riding through fields only for clusters of flamingos to rise into the skies in bursts of colour, or waiting on a bobbing felucca for the sun to rise, it demands your eyeballs.Photo mode will be your new addiction then. Whenever Origins is getting too pretty to cope, all you need to do is tap both analogue sticks and you’ll be in Instagram heaven. Filters and an impressively untethered camera means you’ll be freezing Bayek half way through every leap of faith or pyramid slide just to capture that perfect moment. You can even admire everyone else’s handiwork on your map and heart it Instagram-style as they appear across the world. And the modern day? No spoilers here but it’s very much there but easily dismissed if all you want is the delights of history. For lore fans though, this is a step in the right direction for a streamlined story to come and a computer of files is worth draining for info. Adding yet another layer to an already impressive world, this is the most cohesive Assassins experience yet. And does it explain everything for 10 years of the Creed? Of course it does. Everything gets an origins story. Feathers, missing fingers, hidden blades, the Creed itself and even that logo. Everything is present and correct and the campaign conclusion will send Assassin’s Creed lore fans suitably giddy while simultaneously teasing a new era of Creed for the years ahead. Confident, exhilarating and utterly deadly, Assassin’s Creed Origins is now, finally, the one to beat.  Louise Blain is a journalist and broadcaster specialising in gaming, technology, and entertainment.

Game Informer,"Though Assassin’s Creed has experimented with tower defense, grappling hooks, and naval combat over the years, it isn’t always quick to evolve. Changes to mission design, combat, and exploration are staggered across separate entries, which dulls the impact of any one change. With an extra year of development to question what makes the franchise great, Assassin’s Creed Origins implements sweeping changes in every department, reworking or cutting worn-out features and building new ones in their place. These changes come with some growing pains, but result in one of the largest, most open-ended entries in the series.Origins chronicles the foundation of the Assassins and their conflict with the Templars (called the Order of the Ancients) in Ptolemic-era Egypt. You take the role of Bayek, a military scout hunting down members of the Order who’ve killed his son. Bayek is a strong lead who sits at a comfortable midpoint between the playfulness of Ezio and the brooding over-seriousness of Connor. The supporting cast is great as well, and several moments build on his relationships with his community, family, and friends across Egypt in ways that flesh out his character.  Bayek’s wife, Aya, steals every scene she’s in, and the story explores their relationship in ways that made me miss her when she and Bayek are apart.While the heroes stand out, the villains tend to bleed into one another a little too quickly. Major targets feel like stepping stones rather than enemies you can take true pride in killing. Assassinating them is still satisfying, but only because the hunt itself is usually fun, not because Bayek’s hatred for them comes across through the storytelling. A couple of major targets, like the Scarab and the Hyena, provide some great moments as they chew scenery, complicate their roles as villains, and provide context for why they joined the Order, but their arcs go by too quickly, and they're quickly supplanted by new targets.Bayek has more freedom than his descendants when it comes time hunt someone down. Bayek has no need to closely follow or eavesdrop on his targets, and so those stock mission types are gone. In their place are open-ended goals which involve rescuing, looting, or killing in whatever ways you can manage. Infiltrating a fortress at night, I was able to wipe out most of its guards in their sleep. Another group of guards kept a captive lion, which made unleashing it by firing an arrow at its cage fitting revenge. I loved that I never had to worry about failing a mission unless I died in combat, which also made me more likely to experiment with the different tools at my disposal.The expanded freedom can lead to some anticlimactic moments, however. One mission required I steal a horse from an enemy camp, and I was able to simply ride into it without paying attention to the guards, mount the horse, and gallop my way back out without having to fight anyone. Mission objectives also repeat too often, and while the act of sneaking into a fortress never completely loses its appeal, having to escort or carry a target out of a camp is less gratifying after doing it several times. Combat has been reworked for the better. Dodging, blocking, and hitting opponents feels more active than the counter-based approach of past games. The basics are simple (break enemy shield stances with a heavy attack, dodge unblockable ones) and not quite as sharp as you might find in dedicated action games, but I enjoyed fighting enemies as a change of pace from sneaking around. Being seen doesn’t mean having an entire battalion descend upon you as long as you can take out the offending guard quickly, which helps even the balance between sneaking and fighting.As you explore Egypt and pick up missions, raid encampments, and gather resources you'll earn XP, which makes you stronger and grants access to new abilities and weapons. Although most of the loot you find comes down to a small variety of swords, spears, scepters, and heavy weapons, these archetypes are all fun to learn, and I received stronger gear often enough to experiment regularly. Rare gear layers on special attributes like healing you with every attack, or lighting everything it strikes on fire – which can mean Bayek himself if you’re not careful.The skill tree offers a number a ways to grow your character by either improving on improving your current toolset or giving you new toys to play with. On the practical side, the ability to switch between two weapons lets you adapt to different combat scenarios, and assassinating two targets sequentially makes stealth intrusions smoother. However, being able to tame wild animals and sic them on anyone who got in my way made for some fun moments of chaos.The leveling system gives you goals to chase, but also comes with restrictions. Higher-level missions and enemies are frustrating to fight, so you may need to level up between missions. This especially slows the pace down as the main story builds momentum in its final hours. Areas are also cordoned off by level, which means your path through the world isn’t as open as its size leads you to believe. You can speed up the leveling and upgrade curve by paying real money, but I never felt strained for resources or wanting for new weapons. For players wary of microtransactions, I can’t say the implementation in Origins improves the experience, but it isn’t intrusive.
 
Climbing vantage points reveals various activities on the map, but Origins scales back the number of icons onscreen while giving you a much larger area to explore. Egypt is massive, and a joy to explore. It features a variety of beautiful sandswept deserts, jagged cliffsides, tranquil oases, and forested swamps, along with the cityscapes like Alexandria. Most secrets are marked as a question marks on the map, and lead to substantive activities like raiding tombs (which involves a good mix of exploration and light puzzle-solving) or finding stone circles (which unlock meaningful flashback conversations between Bayek and his son). This gives scouring the map a sense of discovery that, along with the beautiful landscapes, made me more eager to explore the world. As much as Origins improves the world inside the Animus, it struggles to provide a meaningful reason to venture outside of it. After several installments of pushing the present-day storyline into the background, Origins attempts to bring it back – or wants you to think it does. Although you control a character who can move around a small area (much like Desmond in earlier games), the present-day plotline isn’t significant enough to be given this thorough a treatment. It tells as short, self-contained personal story with a couple of minor revelations about the Animus, but doesn’t offer insight into the present-day world or make me rethink past events. By the time I had finished this story, I wondered why I had been kicked out of the Animus at all.Origins doesn’t completely rebuild Assassin’s Creed, but makes a number of smart, significant changes to a formula that, despite yearly updates, was showing its age. The increased freedom in how you approach targets, the more active combat, and alluring world not only make exploring Egypt a rewarding experience, but also offer a strong direction for the series going forward while still remembering what made it unique in the first place. This review pertains to the Xbox One version of the game, running on an Xbox One X. The game is also available on PS4 and PC.

Polygon,"Filed under:A much-anticipated return for gaming’s leading historical fiction seriesIf you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.Like so many big-budget extravaganzas, Assassin’s Creed Origins is an attempt to perfectly triangulate the three corners of open-world game design: environment simulation, storytelling and gameplay. The problem for developers like Ubisoft Montreal, which cleave closely to the ideals of open-worldness, is that those three things are in a constant state of tension and opposition. The trick when making these games is to diminish the necessary compromises for each of the three, so that world, story and game come through together, relatively unspoiled. A paradox sits at the center of such an endeavor. If one corner makes a sudden reach toward genuine excellence, it stretches and perverts the triangle. So it is with Assassin’s Creed Origins, a vibrating world of color and life tied to a serviceable story and an altogether familiar set of gameplay chores. This is a good game, but it is an acute triangle, unequal in its proportions.I climb to the top of a Great Pyramid. It’s not easy. If I miss a handhold, I skitter downward, yelling blue murder at my own failure. But once atop the structure, I’m rewarded with a view of ancient Egypt, its trees, mountains, monuments, rivers, ruins and villages.It is necessary for me to mention that this review is based on the Xbox One X version of Assassin’s Creed Origins. Ubisoft insisted on only allowing me to play this one version as a condition of playing the game, pre-release. And so I’m in the awkward position of critiquing a piece of software made for a console that will not exist as a consumer product for another few weeks.Ubisoft wants us to see the world it has created in the best possible light. But if you are not planning on buying an Xbox One X, you should read this review with the necessary caveats. I have not played this game on any console that you (or I) actually own.There is red and green and gold here, turquoise, amaranth and pearl shimmering in digital sunlight. Wind skitters over dunes, flamingoes startle over shimmering streams. Trees sway, roads bend, oxen drudge.This is a space of loveliness, a work of art. If you ever wanted to step into the distant past, into a simulation of ancient life, here it is. From marble palaces to mud-hut hovels, from dead carcasses to soaring aqueducts, this Assassin’s Creed overachieves on looks. If aesthetics alone were the reason for a full year’s delay on the game, it’s been worth the wait. This is, by far, the best-looking Assassin’s Creed ever made. It’s one of the most beautiful games I’ve ever played. I enjoy being a part of this world, and my enjoyment is no fad. Even after 50 hours of play, I’m still finding things that please my senses. I spend a lot of time just trotting around between quests, and I’m perfectly happy to do so. Previous Assassin’s Creed games took place in the late medieval or post-Renaissance world. That makes sense for a series so heavily geared toward climbing buildings. Ancient structures were rarely more than four stories high. But this ancient Egypt is both monumental and vertical. It is mountainous, dotted with fortifications and grandeur. There is never a shortage of walls to scale, hillsides to scramble across and rooftops to skedaddle along. And they all look bloody marvelous. There’s also a complex and mostly fulfilling story at play. This tale begins at a time when Cleopatra is seeking to gain the throne from her younger brother, a kid called Ptolemy who doesn’t know his arse from his obelisk. The people are in need of a strong leader. Cleopatra has the necessary charisma. She turns to the people for support.The protagonist, Bayek of Siwa, is a Medjay, a kind of ancient cop / social enforcer. He despises Ptolemy and his handlers. He has personal reasons for his hatred, a mission of revenge that I won’t spoil here. The story does well to explore this aspect of his rage, which helps to explain his incredible capacity for violence.Through cutscenes and quests, we get a sense of the intersection between Bayek’s private woes and the greater political conflict. Time and again, he helps people who have been wronged by the state, and so edges closer to his own desire to complete himself through revenge.Sometimes he meets characters who are genuinely funny and human. I especially love the orphan boy trader who can’t stop telling tall tales about the many gruesome ways in which his parents were killed. I also laughed out loud at the playwright working on his new masterpiece: My Pharaoh Lady. But this game also offers that rare quality of emotion. It includes storylines with real sadness. I played one mission in a state of genuine rage at the things Bayek’s enemies had done. If I didn’t weep at their cruelty, I came pretty close.Bayek’s wife, Aya, is a big part of this story. She’s a true believer in the Cleopatra project, and just as fierce a warrior as her husband. She is playable for parts of the game, and although she lacks some of Bayek’s specific powers, she offers a satisfying alternative. These two are deeply entwined and very sexy. They spend a lot of time making love in exotic locations. They’re the kind of couple you want to have as friends, but who only really have time for one another.I like them both for their sense of nobility and morality. Bayek is kind, devout and certain about how the world ought to be ordered. Aya is a passionate and clever political operative. They both serve as excellent role models, with none of the cheesy posturing we often see in gaming leads.It’s worth mentioning that they are both dark-skinned, as you’d expect from north Africans. This game doesn’t whitewash history, even if some of the accents sound a bit wobbly, at least to my ear. Post-release I’d like to hear the views of people more intimately knowledgeable about the region and its peoples.In the way of fictional warrior characters of the past, Bayek has a habit of humorless, overly noble declarations. But he’s also capable of cracking jokes, very occasionally, which make him even more adorable. Upon seeing the Sphinx for the first time, he echoes a million tourists to come, noting that it’s “not as big as I expected.”As the game progresses, Bayek and Aya are involved in some of the most iconic moments in ancient history. I won’t spoil them here, but a full range of Cleopatra’s big scenes are explored with our heroes usually in attendance, sometimes startlingly so. I have a soft spot for the ancient world, and thoroughly enjoyed being a part of these famous tableaux, although I suspect Cleopatra’s portrayal owes more to Elizabeth Taylor than to historical truth. But if these moments stand out in memory, it’s because they have entertained and intrigued large chunks of humanity for more than two millennia. The main body of Assassin’s Creed Origin’s story is videogamey and transient.The bosses are interesting, in that they all have semi-reasonable objectives behind their evil. But most of the narrative is looped around quests in which Bayek has to go and do a thing on behalf of a person who has been misfortuned by wicked power.The writers have obviously made a vigorous attempt to disguise the sameness of these little tales, and Bayek’s strength as a character pulls a lot of weight. But eventually, the narrative underpinning these missions becomes a kind of desert, rolling into the distance. It’s a nice view, at first, but wearying after a while.As the side quests roll on, it becomes clear that the gameplay isn’t nearly as astounding as the game’s setting. While the world is superb, and the story offers plenty to admire, the game itself is much as you’d expect, if you’ve spent any time playing entries in the Assassin’s Creed series. Time is spent in a rigamarole of to-ing and fro-ing between quest givers who generally want me to go to a place and rescue something or someone from a bunch of guards who are standing around, waiting for me to figure out the best way to either kill them, incapacitate them or sneak past them. Some scenes ask me to investigate a room or a house, but this is just a matter of following visual leads and resolving some light puzzles, like smashing pottery to reveal a secret entrance to another room, where some basic tomb raiding might occur.There are a few set-pieces that serve as nice diversions, including grand Ben-Hur-style trireme battles that offer a lot more in sensory thrills than real challenges. It really does come down to “row well, and live.”Missions are usually about establishing ownership of garrisoned physical spaces. I climb walls, or I sneak under them. I hide in bushes, and I dart into tents. I make use of an eagle above to watch and learn the movements of my enemies, so I can plan a path forward.As a stealth and combat game, Assassin’s Creed Origins is entirely competent. If I’m careless, nearby guards will spot me. They will kill me if I allow myself to be outnumbered, or if I go into a mission without the necessary leveling up, or if I hang around long enough for them to call in reinforcements.Some concessions to the formula have been added. There are always plenty of different ways to complete an infiltration mission. I can move time forward from day to night, so that my enemies are resting or even sleeping. If I come back at another time, some of the guard patterns will have changed slightly. I can release wild animals from cages in order to aid my cause, or I can make use of fire.I move through my missions, leveling up, improving my combat abilities, taking on enemies who are also stronger and stronger. I feel guided through an experience, rather than let loose in a world. In theory, I can trot through the entire map, almost from the start of the game. But each area is marked according to levels. I really don’t want to travel great distances just to be mauled to death by a mangy dog with a level 10 times higher than mine. The game takes care to make sure I only really play those quests that are appropriate to my level.It’s this construction that belies the openness of this world. I suspect that many players will follow a broadly similar path, choosing much the same side quests in order to earn the power to complete the main story.There are opportunities to just go off and do my own thing. I can hunt animals for resources that can then be used to upgrade my gear. Or I can fight trade caravans and steal their gear. I can just stroll around and enjoy the world. But the game itself makes a lot of compromises with its alleged openness, in order to guide the player through a coherent experience. In essence, Assassin’s Creed Origins is much the same game as the original Assassin’s Creed, which came out a decade ago. It’s a formula that people like to play, and it’s certainly been honed and improved over the years. Origins is, then, undoubtedly the best iteration of this formula yet. But I yearn for a fresh approach and new ideas, something that astounds the senses as much as the wondrous world this game inhabits.Assassin’s Creed Origins was reviewed on an Xbox One X over the course of a week at an event hosted by Ubisoft in San Francisco.

   on October 26, 2017 at 4:00AM PDTWhen you need to see the bigger picture, sometimes it's best to return to your roots. Assassin's Creed Origins takes this thinking to heart and steps into the seamless and dynamic open world of ancient Egypt. Although this move shows glimmers of a brighter future for the series, it also becomes clear that its core gameplay and presentation have some difficulties keeping up with the newfound pace and scale.Blurring the lines between prequel and sequel, Assassin's Creed Origins takes us back to the beginning of the Assassin Brotherhood, while also laying the groundwork for a new present-day storyline. Set during the time of the Ptolemaic Kingdom in Egypt, you take on the role of Bayek, a Medjay ranger who embarks on a quest for revenge against a mysterious order that pre-dates the Templars. Crossing paths with historical figures such as Cleopatra and Julius Caesar, Bayek travels through the dense and varied lands of Northern Africa. He'll sneak, loot, and stab key figures in the social and political worlds of Egypt, leading to several unforeseen consequences for the future of the Kingdom, right up to present day events.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Assassin's Creed Origins Video ReviewWhile references to significant characters and events from other games are present, they take a backseat to the parallel narratives of Origins, particularly to that of Bayek and his companions as they lay the foundations of their creed in Egypt. Bayek himself is a major influence in the world, thoughtful of others and his surroundings. Despite facing tragedy, he isn't shy about breaking the tension with a joke or sharing a tender moment with loved ones. While he's steadfast in his resolve to take revenge against those who wronged him, he's always willing to help those in need.Origins makes good on the potential of its setting, showing off a clash of ideologies and cultures during Ptolemaic Egypt, and giving it life in a number of surprising ways. In its 30 hour main story, you'll travel across Egypt and meet different allies and enemies with their own agendas. While some locations share a few too many similarities in style and general landscape--and others are frustratingly sparse with content and activity--Egypt overall is vibrant and lush, giving a strong sense of life within it.From the flocks of birds that rise in unison while running through marshlands, to the crocodiles that pluck sailors off their boats as they float across rivers--Assassin's Creed Origins displays vivid details of a world in action, and houses several unique AI systems that play off each other. In one instance, you could find yourself raiding a camp, and which suddenly come under attack by groups of angry hippos from the nearby lake. Egypt is impressively dense in the more populated cities and towns, convincingly realized through a clear attention to detail, and is one of the series' finest achievements.Playing through Bayek's journey is surprisingly educational, making each event and landmark--even the gladiator arenas and chariot race tracks--an opportunity to learn more about the setting and period. From general chatter of crowds in Alexandria, to the various notes and logs found from points of interests and bandit camps, you'll come to learn quite a lot about the past ages of Egypt, what led to the ""present"" state of its Ptolemaic rule, and the cause of the social strife throughout. Showing instances of culture clash between Greco-Roman and Egyptian influences, the core narrative and side-stories are engaging and feel meaningful, tackling issues of racism, colonialism, and the systemic misogyny of the times.This is especially relevant to Bayek, who is himself an outsider in many of the locations he travels to, and as a result witnesses some of the abuse firsthand. Origins deftly handles its overall tone despite this by balancing moments of heartbreak and earnestness--such as quests dealing with greedy landowners poisoning lower-class citizens--with moments of levity, like when Bayek helps out local children in cities by performing parkour tricks.Unfortunately, several technical hiccups and bugs crop up--which disrupt the flow of the experience. During our playthrough of the Xbox One X and PS4 versions, instances of texture pop-in, noticeable framerate dips during cutscenes and gameplay, and odd graphical issues while exploring and interacting with other characters detracted from impactful moments and events. These issues unfortunately persist throughout, slightly dragging down the otherwise incredible setting.Moving steadily away from the somewhat identical formula of past Assassin's Creed games--where you gradually move out to different hub areas and tackle largely isolated missions--Origins gives you a greater level of freedom and agency in a more seamless world, where you can take part in activities at your leisure. With each region possessing several points of interest, veering off the path to find sights unseen can yield valuable loot, history about the world, and other secrets that tie into something greater.Alongside introducing a new open setting, Origins overhauls one of the series' other major gameplay pillars: combat. Trading steel with enemies now feels more active and involved thanks to its dynamic strikes and real-time blocking and parrying. While certain traces of the series' group-oriented action remain, combat focuses more on smaller skirmishes where you pick your moments and strike at the right time. Moreover, ranged combat has also been improved, adding greater maneuverability and accuracy, including a useful slow-mo aim while leaping through the air. Though this new approach to combat initially feels like an improvement all around--making battles more engaging and involved--some of these changes give rise to problems that can make them a drag.While combat is solid when fighting a limited number of foes, things quickly turn south when more enemies are added into the mix, as the mechanics are designed for more intimate engagements. This becomes especially problematic with a lock-on camera that follows the action far too closely, turning battles that could be tactical and fierce into disorienting and clumsy encounters. In some cases, it felt better fighting without lock-on enabled to better keep track of what's going on.This clumsiness is even present in the stealth system, which is more awkward than in past games. Somehow, slower and deliberate movement can feel unreliable due to controls that are less accurate and unresponsive. In some instances while sneaking and climbing, Bayek can hitch onto ledges and other objects when he gets close enough, frequently resulting in accidental exposure to enemies. Sneaking is undermined by these inconsistencies, whether it comes from enemies seeing through objects, or instances where AI partners routinely walk into danger. Stealth is often more of a hassle than it's worth, making it one of Origins' weakest aspects. Assassin's Creed Origins attempts to blend the established stealth-action elements with the mechanics of an action-RPG, but these two halves don't always coalesce. By including stat-building and a loot grind, it creates needless level-gating for areas of the map. This results in time spent grinding to acquire vital skills and resources--and in the broader sense can feel like artificial padding. This, in turn, conflicts with the fantasy of being a skillful assassin who uses his resources and wits to maneuver through enemy hideouts. It can be quite jarring spending the time sneaking up to elite enemies, and then finding out your hidden blade won't work for an assassination due to it being underpowered.While Assassin's Creed Origins reaches great heights in this new setting, it routinely runs into issues that bog down the overall experience. Technical issues make for an inconsistent experience and its new gameplay pillars wobble under the weight of its systems. But despite this, the world of Origins remains fresh and exciting to explore, which is a testament to the remarkable setting and compelling story. Assassin's Creed has undergone many changes in its long and storied history, and Origins feels like the first step in the start of a new journey. It has its fair share of problems, but the vision for its future is one worth pursuing.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"
Kotaku,"For all its extraordinary visual splendor, Assassin’s Creed Origins is ultimately an ordinary video game. That’s not such a bad thing, particularly if you like looking at pretty vistas and watching numbers go up.Origins is the 10th main entry in Ubisoft’s series of historical murder games. It is also the latest in the current crop of uber-open world games, less of a structured collection of escalating challenges and more of a receptacle for a Nilesque river of capital-C Content. Each of its sprawling panoramas is loaded with forts to conquer, sidequests to complete, collectables to uncover, and vantage points to ascend.I spent more than 30 hours finishing the main storyline, but could easily spend another 30 just exploring and messing around. In those first 30+ hours, I rarely found myself doing something I hadn’t already done in many other games. I hid in tall grass and whistled to attract patrolling guards. I visited a blacksmith to upgrade my sword.  I entered an arena and fought off waves of enemies. I also climbed the Great Sphinx of Giza, of course. You can’t climb the Great Sphinx of Giza in most video games.All Assassin’s Creed games are defined by their historical setting. This one’s set in Egypt in the era of Cleopatra, around a half-century before B.C. became A.D.. True to the name, Origins sets out to illustrate the origins of the Assassin’s order that we’ve been following from the Crusades in the Holy Land (2007’s Assassin’s Creed) all the way up to Victorian-era London (2015’s Assassin’s Creed Syndicate). That last game was cutting so close to modern times that the series creators at Ubisoft evidently decided it was time to break the sequence and jump waaaay back in time.Origins tells the story of Bayek, a man who occupies the role of “medjay” in a region of Egypt called Siwa. The game depicts a medjay as a sort of all-purpose helping hand, a combination constable and social worker tasked with aiding anyone who may need it. It’s an ideal role for a video game protagonist.As medjay, Bayek explores the game’s vast open map, helping the many (many, many) people who ask. Origins drops you right into the action and quickly falls into a predictable, even soothing rhythm: you reach a new area, and take in the sights. You look at your map and find all the sidequests in that region. One by one, you complete those quests, each of which involves some variation of sneaking, assassinating, or fighting. As you progress, your level will slowly climb, your gear will slowly improve, and you’ll unlock better and better abilities. Before long, you’ll go to a new area with  higher-level enemies.Of course, in the Assassin’s Creed tradition, you’re not actually playing as Bayek. You’re a modern-day researcher exploring history through a fully immersive VR-style technology called the Animus. Assassin’s Creed has stepped back from the more involved present-day storylines of the earlier games in the series, and the most recent entries have paid only the faintest lip-service to the convoluted conspiracies and soapy familial plotlines established in the first few games. Origins initially seems like it’s going to return to a more substantial exploration of the present-day stuff, but it’s ultimately content to kick the can down the road yet again. How much that bothers you will depend on how much stock you’ve placed in the series’ evil-corporation meta-story up to this point. I’m fine treating these games more or less as standalone stories of people throughout history. The modern-day easter eggs are a bonus.Bayek is on a quest to avenge the death of his young son, which was brought about by a group of powerful masked men he knows only by their aliases. His quest for revenge takes him far from his home in Siwa, naturally. As it turns out—surprise, surprise!—there’s a vast conspiracy brewing across Egypt, Greece and Rome that will sweep up Bayek, his equally vengeful wife Aya, and all the rulers, holy leaders, and conspirators they meet along the way.Origins’ story struggles mightily to unite the historical with the fictional and only succeeds some of the time. Bayek and Aya form its emotional core, but for the first half of the game their relationship is only explored through act-break cutscenes separated by dozens of hours of Bayek’s lone sidequesting. By contrast, the final two acts are entirely linear, barreling through an HBO series’ worth of setpieces and historical events in just a few hours. (A wise video game writer once told me never to complain about an open-world game’s pacing, but here I feel the complaint is justified.) I liked how the writers depicted Bayek and Aya’s relationship—their clear passion for one another, and the different ways they were each coping with the loss of their only son. I only wish it had been given more time to breathe, particularly in those final hours.Bayek and Aya’s story is eclipsed by the historical epic surrounding them, which I found much less interesting. I rarely had a sense of who was doing what, or which bad guy had been where, when. The men who killed Bayek’s son were all wearing masks, and Bayek must learn their identities before killing them. That makes sense structurally and adds an element of mystery to his quest for vengeance, but it hurts the story’s overall coherence. It’s difficult to form much of a relationship with a masked villain, and they’re only unmasked immediately before they die. As the story progressed, particularly in those linear final acts, major villains were introduced and dispensed with so quickly that I had no time to form an opinion about them.  Each of Bayek’s targets became just another objective marker on my screen, one more person to be stabbed or shot with an arrow.Origins fails to overcome the series’ long-standing problem establishing its heroes and villains. It aims to show the origins of the long-running conflict between the freedom-loving order of the Assassins and the power-hungry order of the Templars, but as always the distinction between the two is murky. The most consistent villain in Assassin’s Creed games can perhaps best be thought of as history itself. That’s a hell of a villain, you know? Kind of hard to give history itself a big third-act monologue to sum the story up.I don’t fault the writers at Ubisoft Montreal for attempting such a feat, and actually admire their ambition. Origins is an unusually sprawling game even by modern standards, with a script to match. It’s full to the brim with characters who talk, and talk, and talk, and just when you think they’re done talking, they talk some more. In the grand tradition of open-world games, the stories get better the further you get from the main narrative. Almost all sidequests lead to some sort of interesting twist or turnabout, and some, like the story of an aging arena fighter or an old man who lost his book of the dead scrolls, introduce minor characters as well-written and enjoyable as anyone in the main storyline. Many sidequests dovetail neatly with main story quests, or resolve the unfinished stories of side characters you may have met while doing grander things. The more of them you complete, the richer the narrative tapestry becomes. It’s neat.Bayek may meet interesting people with interesting problems, but the solutions to those problems are almost invariably the same. First he’ll go somewhere and “investigate” the scene, using his enhanced eagle sense to highlight objects on the screen so you can press a button to interact with them. Once he’s interacted with all the objects, a new objective marker appears. (In a welcome change to the series, there is no mini-map, just a compass at the top of your screen.) You steer Bayek toward that new waypoint in order to sneak into a base and either kill someone or rescue someone. Over and over you’ll perform this same sequence of events, and the extent to which you get tired of it will likely on how much time you spend screwing around and exploring between missions.In addition to walking  around exploring, Origins mostly asks you to engage in three primary activities: climbing, sneaking, and fighting. All of that is governed by a robust new numbers-based RPG system that channels games like Destiny and The Witcher 3. Everything in the game has a number attached to it, from Bayek’s level to his enemies’ to his individual weapons and pieces of armor. Equipment drops randomly and is categorized as common (blue), rare (purple), or legendary (yellow). You can upgrade your best equipment for a fee and keep it with you, and every sidequest you undertake rewards you with XP and the chance to get more loot. If you’ve played an action RPG in the last five years, you’ve seen all of this before, up to and including the white numbers that pop off of enemies (yellow for headshots!) when you damage them.The climbing works much the same as past Assassin’s Creed games, with all the strengths and weaknesses that implies. You press a single button to jump up onto a wall, then move upward with your thumbstick. Going down is a more finicky process, and whichever way you’re going, it can be a trick to get Bayek to go where you want him. Climbing in Origins feels less like you’re taking direct control and more like you’re making suggestions, as though you’re coaxing an artificial intelligence to do an approximation of what you want. It works well enough most of the time, but boy, can it be frustrating when it fails. I lost count of the number of times I was trying to elegantly get Bayek down off a wall and into some bushes without being noticed, only to have him awkwardly mantle around  some pillar or other and get spotted.Sneaking, too, will all be familiar to Assassin’s Creed veterans. With a press of a button Bayek enters stealth mode. He moves around low to the ground, creeping through tall grass and luring enemies to his position for a quick takedown. Most of the game takes place outdoors, and at any moment, you can press a button and zoom up to a literal eagle-eye view courtesy of Bayek’s pet eagle Senu. (Bayek is evidently a warg, gifted with the mystical ability to see through the eyes of his spirit animal.) With an overhead view of the situation, it’s much easier to plan your next move. It’s an idea that’s already been explored in other Ubisoft games like Watch Dogs 2 (an aerial drone) or Far Cry Primal (an actual bird), and it works.Sneaking is functional and even fun to a point, and when things are going smoothly the game gives that familiar, empowering stealth-game feeling of slowly clearing out an enemy base without raising any alarms. However, the stealth often conflicts with Origins’ aggressive leveling system, which puts Bayek at a severe disadvantage when taking on higher-level enemies. If you attempt to sneak into a base that’s at your level or slightly above it, you may find yourself unable to one-shot enemies with your bow or even your deadly assassin’s blade. That makes it impossible to thin the enemy ranks without someone sounding the alarm, which can leave you needing to complete your objective with zero bloodshed (often nearly impossible due to the way levels are designed) or just leave and come back when you’re higher level.When you’re spotted—and you will be—you’ll have to either fight or flee. Choose to flee, and Origins’ weirdo artificial intelligence will quickly make itself known. Enemies will run around like panicked fools, losing and gaining sight of you almost at random. There’s a loose unpredictability to the guards that I frequently found frustrating, and at times it even felt like the game was unfairly nudging alerted patrols toward my concealed my position. I once cheesed my way through a high-level military base by staying in stealth-mode and leading my enemies on an endless chase in circles around the base while I slowly completed objectives. The only thing missing was some yakety sax.If you stand your ground, Bayek will draw his weapon and shield and take on his opponents directly. Assassin’s Creed Origins has changed combat significantly compared with past games in the series, though it hasn’t quite found a comfortable new groove. The new system focuses more on one-on-one fights, pulling the camera in to Bayek’s shoulder and asking players to dodge, parry, and attack with much less aid from the game behind the scenes. Bayek isn’t as magnetized to his enemies as previous Assassin’s Creed protagonists were, so if you don’t close in on an enemy before pressing the attack button, you’ll hit air. It’s a much more skill-based system than past games in the series, though nowhere near as clean or fair as the games from which it seems to be drawing inspiration.While more involved and challenging than its predecessors, Origins’ redesigned combat never really gelled with me. I love hitbox-based melee combat games like Dark Souls, Bloodborne and most recently Nioh, but Origins falls short of those games’ rigid commitment to locked animations, stamina management, and stringent hit registration. Bayek lacks the mobility required to quickly close with his enemies, and his dodge move often feels slow and inconsistent.As a result, combat can feel rubbery and frustrating. That’s rarely much of an issue when fighting ordinary grunts, but can become a real pain during the setpiece boss showdowns that punctuate each act. If a boss hits you, he tends to lock you in a series of unblockable attacks. That means it’s best to keep your distance, which is difficult given Bayek’s limited options for running away or quickly closing with an enemy. Many enemies also have a tendency to begin an attack windup, then chase after you for 50 or even 100 feet before finally letting it swing. Avoiding one of those attacks can feel like trying fruitlessly to escape someone who’s been attached to you with an invisible rubber band.I’m glad the combat designers at Ubisoft Montreal are trying something different with Origins’ combat, and hope they continue along this trajectory in the future. If they can drop the vestiges of past games’ arcade-y weirdness and more fully embrace the rigid but fair hitbox-based fights of Nioh and Dark Souls, they’ll be on solid ground. Origins’ swordplay isn’t quite there yet.Assassin’s Creed Origins’ greatest success is its setting. While obviously condensed when compared with its real-life counterpart, the game’s version of ancient Egypt is stunningly rendered and eminently explorable. For all my gripes about sneaking and fighting, when it comes down to it, these games have never primarily appealed to me on the strength of their stealth and swashbuckling. Only in a few specific instances have they drawn me in with their stories, for that matter. I’m here for the virtual tourism.At every turn, Origins aims to dazzle the player with sumptuous vistas and visuals. I played on a PS4 Pro in 1080p resolution and was routinely struck by its beauty. I’m sure it looks even better on a 4k TV with HDR, and better still when running on a beefy gaming PC or a powerful Xbox One X. RAM limitations and clock speeds are only part of the equation, of course, and Origins is just as much a triumph of artistry as it is of technology. There’s something about the light in this game, the way it casts off of surfaces and seems to flow through everything around you. The sun saturates the hazy streets of Alexandria just so. In the desert at night, the moon imbues dune and palm frond alike with a luminous glow. God, it looks good.I’m less enamored of composer Sarah Schachner’s musical score, which echoes the ponderous synth-dirges of past games in the series without adding much in the way of thematic development or new tonal ideas. Austin Wintory’s lively string and woodwind arrangements from Syndicate were such a welcome burst of energy that I’d hoped the series’ traditionally mopey musical milieu may have been rejuvenated. Turns out Wintory’s score was the exception that proves the rule. Origins returns to the series’ usual filtered synths, low drones, and portentous, reverb-drenched rebab solos. Considering the game’s overwhelming visual beauty, its lack of a musical identity feels like a missed opportunity.""Those are some pretty pyramids.""Third-person historical murder simAn exceptionally beautiful-looking game. Exploring and uncovering secrets is a pleasure. Some well-written sidequests.Main story is a jumble. Climbing and sneaking are often awkward. The overhauled combat doesn’t quite gel. RPG leveling can feel artificially constraining.Ubisoft MontrealPS4 (Pro played), Xbox One, PCOctober 27Completed the story and a variety of sidequests and other optional stuff over the course of about 34 hours. Still have plenty left to see.Before Origins, Ubisoft spent several years releasing an Assassin’s Creed game every fall like clockwork. The publisher took 2016 off, which gave Origins a full extra year in development. It would seem that year was spent expanding the game’s world, implementing its RPG elements, and refining some fundamentals, rather than exploring the sorts of experimental new ideas for which Assassin’s Creed has become known. From 2007 to 2015, Ubisoft’s designers pioneered new ideas in open world design, repeating and iterating on them with such frequency that the “Ubisoft open-world formula” became widely understood shorthand for certain often-ridiculed game design tropes. With Origins, Assassin’s Creed has changed course and begun to follow in the footsteps of other games.Each of Origins’ big new ideas is something I’ve seen before, from the leveling and sidequest structure of The Witcher 3 to the combat of Dark Souls. There’s nothing wrong with borrowing good ideas from other good games, of course, even if Origins’ execution of those ideas is uneven. But I regularly felt the absence of the sorts of interesting new concepts I’d grown accustomed to from this series. There’s nothing in Origins that’s along the lines of Brotherhood’s recruitable followers, Black Flag’s ship-to-ship swashbuckling and island exploration, Syndicate’s split-protagonist storyline and grappling hook, or even Revelations’ crowd-manipulating bombs and city takeover systems. Origins plays it safe in comparison, with scant surprises from start to finish. If you’ve watched 30 minutes of this game, you probably have a pretty good sense of what the next 30 hours will look like.Assassin’s Creed Origins is ungainly and uneven, beautiful and frustrating, expansive and unexpectedly conservative. It won’t challenge the palate; rather, it is a prime example of video-game comfort food. It’s here to be slowly enjoyed, offering a seemingly endless supply of gorgeous locales and steadily-filling progress bars. If Ubisoft is a digital travel agency, Origins provides one of the most sweeping, enveloping destinations they’ve yet offered. Come for the beautiful recreation of ancient Egypt, stay for the beautiful recreation of ancient Egypt.Correction: An earlier version of this review incorrectly stated that you couldn’t manually toggle between a combat and non/combat state. Turns out, I had that wrong. You can toggle between shield mode and free-running with the left shoulder button, which does help combat feel less restrictive. I’ve updated the review and removed a gif of me trying to escape a buggy boss while in shield mode, since it wasn’t really a fair indication of how combat works."
USgamer,"Assassin’s Creed Origins is a triumphant return for a franchise that was tottering about with fatigue just two years ago.Prior to playing Assassin’s Creed Origins, I believed the series needed drastic change – a full rethink, a reboot, and ruthless surgery of the many Frankenstein features sewn on there over the years. This has not happened, but that’s okay: turns out what Assassin’s Creed and the people who make it really needed was a rest.In the three years between Assassin’s Creed Unity and Origins, Ubisoft Montreal has doubled down on the two things that make Assassin’s Creed great: an interesting, quasi-systemic open world and a busy and varied player toolbox. It has also foregrounded progression, eliminated frustrations, squashed technical issues, tightened up its storytelling and taken a good long look at the bar set by rival titles this generation. I'm not finished with it yet, because it's sodding ginormous, but it's already clear the results are fantastic. 
 
One of the reasons Assassin’s Creed Origins is great is that Ptolemaic Egypt is just wild. The clash of Egyptian cultures with Greek occupiers grants us diverse aesthetics, a huge cast of interesting characters, the buzz of multiple languages and loads of interesting history and mythology to gawk at and learn from. Historical tourism, one of the franchise’s first pillars, is at its best here (mileage will vary for Egyptian players).Ubisoft has filled the dauntingly enormous world up with impressive architectural sites; dramatic landscapes; and busy hubs. The environment is much more varied than you might expect, and is peppered with tombs, monuments, temples, shrines, caves, oases and verticality. Also, the weather does some amazing things.Ubisoft has sensibly included a photo mode, and you can opt in to automatically share and receive photos taken by others. This is a great way to highlight the work, but also to point players at locations they might otherwise overlook. Very clever. 
 
The real joy is in what goes on out there, though; Assassin’s Creed Origins is a real water cooler game. Matt and I have been exchanging little notes, but even so, it’s been really hard not to throw the embargo to the wind and tweet wildly about my adventures, as I am eaten by a new and terrible kind of animal or stumble across fascinating little gems out in the middle of nowhere. I don’t want to spoil these, but I urge you to read any notes you find. They’re all very short, showing an unusual respect for your time, and some of them will lead you to good times as well as having their own interest.Unscripted good times emerge as you unlock new skills and play around with the many tools at your disposal – or just when the game’s systems do their thing. As in Far Cry, animals are a frequent cause of hilarious upset, and fans of the shooter series may be pleased to know you can do some interesting things with fire in Assassin’s Creed Origins, too. Tools and abilities like sleep darts, corpse traps, and turning enemies or animals to your side combine with the bow and Hidden Blade to make stealth less about patiently ghosting and more about what you can get away with in the generous gaps in the AI’s perception. The chaos you can unleash while chortling undetected in the bushes makes up for the way the series has leaned away from the challenging but repetitive stealth mechanics of the early games.When stealth fails, there’s always fighting. Combat has been retooled a little, but holds on to an essential formula of positioning to avoid pincer attacks, dodging or blocking until you see an opening, and then switching between guard-breaking heavy blows and quick attacks to bring down foes. You can use tools to secure an edge, and two of the categories of bow are designed for use between melee attacks, but that one-on-one duelling core remains. Get a good sword. 
 
The weapon loot cycle and your level play a very important role in gating, since enemies do not scale. The good news is that XP rains down on you with the slightest step off the main quest path, and while the loot is RNG-based there’s enough of it scattered about in crates in mission locations that there’s really no need to shop or go treasure hunting as long as you’re levelling up and remembering to swap in more powerful weapons. A very simple vendor-based upgrade system means any rare blades you find can be easily boosted to be relevant at higher levels, and it’s pretty easy to track down materials for crafting upgrades for your other gear. I’m only at level 20 at time of writing, but I’m yet to hit a grind and can’t see any reason to visit the microtransaction store – or even the in-game vendors.The gating is strict, as high-level enemies will humble you, but mainly seems to exist to stop you exhausting yourself trying to fill out everything on the map. On that note, completing main quest and major side missions on your path will generally guide you around a region or group of regions in a way that avoids backtracking or long periods of empty travel, and allows you to fill out the majority of points of interest as you pass them. It makes it all feel less like a chore. 
 
Traversal is also less of a slog thanks to improved climbing. Bayek can scamper up nearly any surface, making exploration even of towering cliffs fast, fluid and fun. He also has fewer moments of confusion, and while I can’t say it’s been perfect, there’s less screeching “go through the window you shithead, no not that ledge, the other ledge, why are you leaping into space” than with previous Assassin’s Creed protagonists. Technical issues and glitches in general, I am pleased to report, seem to be few and far between. Nobody’s face has come off, that’s for sure.This is an extra pleasant change because the cutscenes and dialogue are quite good, once you get over everyone saying “By Sekhmet” and other ancient exclamations and get down to learning new swear words from the (excellent, full-featured) subtitles. The story is easy to follow but not uninteresting, and what I really like is that Bayek generally has a good motivation for doing everything, including side missions. As a sort of community cop with friends everywhere and deep respect for religious traditions, it makes perfect sense for him to drop his non time-critical main quest to right an injustice or retrieve someone’s fallen pal. It feels a lot less like the master assassin, running off to do murderous errands for whatever rando stops him in the street. 
 
Finally, the whole thing is beautifully polished and does not feel dated, as Unity and Syndicate did. Assassin’s Creed Origins is clearly the product of a generation that has given us open world rivals like The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Horizon: Zero Dawn and even Destiny (love that menu cursor!) and has risen to meet and sometimes even exceed the standards set by these competitors while staying faithful to the franchise’s core strengths.Assassin’s Creed Origins is not a dramatic departure from the formula as we last saw it, but manages to be much more fun and feel way more fresh than any entry since Brotherhood and Black Flag. It plays to the strengths of a genre Ubisoft helped bring into the mainstream, respects the player and their freedom, and allows them to beat up crocodiles. I’m into it.Tested on the PlayStation 4.

Destructoid,"darkI’ve beaten every mainline Assassin’s Creed to date. Crazy, I know.I used to be able to not have to add that goofy “mainline” qualifier in, but the series has become so bloated with mobile spinoffs that it’s impossible to keep up with. You know it, I know it, and even Ubisoft knows it, which is why they opted to skip an entire year to lay low for a while. 2016 marked the first time in a while (2008) where there wasn’t a big annual Creed, which is kind of a big deal.It’s refreshing that Ubisoft was able to exercise restraint, because Assassin’s Creed Origins benefits from eschewing the puppy mill style of game production.Assassin’s Creed Origins (PC, PS4 [reviewed], Xbox One)Developer: Ubisoft MontrealPublisher: UbisoftReleased: October 27, 2017MSRP: $59.99Egyptian culture is so entwined with death that a killy assassin game just makes sense. I appreciated the elevated spirituality in Origins, which constantly takes beats from the various polytheist communities within, and wraps them into a setting that doesn’t feel as arbitrary as a few have in the past. I’m not going to act like I truly learned anything of value or got a free crash History 101 course in Egypt (though that functionality is coming), but at no point did Origins feel inauthentic, even when it was dropping fanservicey “origin” bits. Amazing vistas, hidden tombs, and architecture that differs from the rest of the series, or most open world games in general, are its biggest strength.This time you’ll control Bayek an Egyptian that exhibits assassin-ey traits before the actual Brotherhood is formed. Initially, it’s just kind of jumbled, with that classic Assassin’s Creed in media res storytelling you’ve come to sigh at. Basically all you really take away at first is that Bayek is in trouble with the law, was formerly of the law, and you’re supposed to like him. Names like Rabiah and Senu are thrown around, and eventually take shape (the latter is your eagle companion, which allows Eagle Vision to actually make sense), as do pieces of his backstory that explain why he is the way he is.What kicks off as a revenge tale eventually weaves into the historical events of Cleopatra’s exile, Roman influence on Egypt, and the mystery of the cult that Bayek has beef with. Despite the rough start it is engaging, and I found myself actually wanting to unravel said mystery yarn by yarn. Part of it is that Bayek is literally an outsider, even in his homeland, when juxtaposed to the Roman occupation. Instead of being kickstarted by an already badass Brotherhood, he’s mostly on his own.After the token hour or so of an intro Origins will open up and you’ll be able to do whatever, with a very restrained amount of modern-day sections woven in — I’m talking maybe 30 minutes in total, tops, if you get right back into the Animus after the several interludes. Even most of the sidequests don’t feel like throwaway material, and allow for drunken street brawls or detective work. The latter has the tendency to pop up way too often (which is fine for the few bonafide mysteries, but not so much for the obvious “this guy was pushed off a cliff” Murder She Wrote wannabe tales).There is PS4 Pro and Xbox One X support, the former of which this review is based on, and the latter of which I’ll be able to try eventually for our review of the hardware. As for my tests there were some moments where it felt like Origins was buckling under its weight on the Pro. You’re going to see goofy videos pop up starting today with various physics glitches (you know, the stuff people laugh at in GTA but condemn in other games), but it’s stable, and on PS4, I didn’t encounter anything that felt outright broken or unplayable outside of one crash where I lost 30 seconds of progress.Combat has been heavily reworked with a From Software school of thought. You can now control your left and right hand separately (though the left is relegated to a shield), as well as dodge more freely without a sort of scripted dance to it. You’re also not spamming the same weapon type over and over, swapping constantly as you acquire more loot. A fully expanded swimming system that lets you dive for sunken treasure or boating skills that will see you fending off hippos and crocodiles are another fun way to traipse across Egypt.Everything contributes to an experience system, which can feel gamey, but also more freeing in a way. Some areas have soft gates with level requirements, but you really can go wherever, and do whatever to get ahead and gain new abilities. More so than any Creed game to date I found myself wandering the countryside, hunting and taming animals for materials to craft, coming across fun sidequests. I like organically finding things instead of reading them on a tome and following a breadcrumb trail. Senu’s literal Eagle Vision is also a great way for Ubisoft to differentiate themselves from the apt Detective Vision comparison that they’ve run into the ground over the years.Helix Credits, a currency used to buy new costumes, mounts, or gear, are allegedly only limited to in-game money and not real cash. While the Helix item store is live a suspicious “Buy more Helix Credits” option is not — if it does lead to microtransactions we’ll be sure to report on it. As it stands, my review session remained unaffected by any fear of loot boxes/loot box balancing. I was able to finish the campaign just fine without buying anything and by completing sidequests to level up.I was really torn in assessing Assassin’s Creed Origins, as it hits several of the same lows as the rest of the series, with its sometimes uneven mission structure and janky physics. But given that they now have the formula down to a science and didn’t rush it out the door, all of that is a little easier to deal with than its predecessors. It was a big risk trying so many new things at once, but it worked, and the setting carries it.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]GreatImpressive efforts with a few noticeable problems holding them back. Won't astound everyone, but is worth your time and cash.

Michael Leri 
Assassin’s Creed has had a continuous stream of ups, downs, and middling, well, middles. With that in mind, Assassin’s Creed Origins releasing just a month shy of the franchise’s ten-year anniversary isn’t just a coincidence. Like its name implies, the game shows the origins of the Brotherhood while also signalling a new beginning for the aging franchise. But Assassin’s Creed Origins isn’t just a new beginning; it’s also one of the best entries in the series.Despite being an Assassin’s Creed game, its influences reach far beyond its predecessors. Origins openly embraces many of its contemporaries, mainly The Witcher, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, Dark Souls, and the last few Far Cry titles. While old Assassin’s Creed games would stubbornly stick to its dated concepts and spotty controls time and time again, Origins intelligently utilizes its inspirations to modernize and greatly improve itself while keeping its core DNA intact.Stealth is one area that has seen a bevy of enhancements. Sneaking is much easier and user-friendly now because of the handful of nifty tricks it aped from Metal Gear Solid V. Ominous music plays when you’re near an enemy. Cloudy, white indicators fade onto the screen to subtly show the position of nearby guards. Time slows when you get caught, giving you a quick moment to avoid an alert. Borrowing the best, most intuitive elements from other sneaking games helps the series shed the cloud of uncertainty and frustration that has plagued the stealth in Assassin’s Creed since its inception.But on top of adding helpful new systems, Origins has also smoothed out its existing ones. Marking targets from the sky via your feathered recon drone, Senu, is a meaningful and effective way to keep tabs on enemy placements. Aiming is also snappy and feels like a contemporary shooter instead of the clunky automatic and manual targeting the series was awkwardly married to. Crouching and dashing, as insignificant as they seem to bring it up, now actually feel like they should and work with you, not against you. This is an extension of the simplified climbing controls that, despite a small handful of annoying exceptions, finally listen and behave like a regular video game. These advancements should be a given and, to any other series, they would be. But finally seeing Assassin’s Creed ditch its anachronistic controls and become better because of it is worth mentioning.Combat has not only been improved; it’s been completely overhauled. Fights are more deliberate and push the player to focus more on identifying threats and making decisions over waiting for the counter icon to pop up in order to insta-kill everyone. Parries are still important but they are only a part of your strategy and not the whole strategy itself. Blocking, positioning, and carefully-timed strikes are vital too since your new shield only blocks your front half and whiffed attacks leave you open to easy counterattacks. These defensive and offensive drawbacks give importance to your actions and the weighty, yet responsive controls give you the liberty to quickly make those decisions at a moment’s notice (aside from the few seemingly unavoidable attacks). Assessing your foes and knowing when to strike, counter, dodge, block, or run away gives the combat a consistently rewarding sense of depth from beginning to end.The story, however, isn’t as engaging from beginning to end. Origins follows Bayek, an Ancient Egyptian Medjay (protector of the pharaoh), as he plots revenge against an unknown entity while simultaneously starting the Brotherhood of Assassins. However, it’s not as simple as that brief description might imply.Origins shows the genesis of the Creed while also juggling a half-dozen other threads. It touches on keeping a marriage together, Egypt’s power struggle, starting the Brotherhood, a corrupt shadow organization, revenge, the Greeks and the Romans. Despite its wealth of topics, it’s never satisfyingly saying anything about any particular subject. It tries to focus on too many things — the literal antithesis of having a focus — and robs every individual arc of a payoff because it’s constantly interrupting itself with another different narrative element. The central revenge narrative suffers the most since each target barely gets enough face time for you to want to kill them as much as Bayek does. Fewer main plot points would tighten up the narrative and recycling those cut threads into side missions would give each concept the proper space to breathe and develop.Despite these drawbacks the plot is still entertaining, thanks to Bayek. He’s incredibly noble and determined but with the heart and respect that round out his character. While his aggressive bellows and deep, booming voice demand your attention, his tender moments were what stuck out the most. His interactions with his wife, Aya, were full of the type of marital love and passion we don’t usually see in video games and I would have loved to see more of a focus on their relationship. Bonding with his son was also a tragically underutilized highlight the game should have honed in on more often. He even apologizes as he loots tombs and small character moments like this define Bayek and make him a standout among the other assassins.Bayek is a good, memorable character, but Egypt outshines him. Ancient Egypt is the best location in the series, checking off all the boxes for a good video game representation of a historical setting. It’s a huge, gorgeous collection of varied environments that hit all the familiar places from your history textbook while also letting you discover new, lesser-known wonders. Yes, the view from atop of the famous Great Pyramid of Giza is stunning, especially at sunset, but so is marveling at the dark, volcanic hills of the Black Desert and the crocodile-infested wetlands of Krokodilopolis. It’s stunning regardless of the time or place and it’s packed with of a ton of passable-to-decent side missions that give you a good enough excuse to explore every town, desert, and body of water.Egypt’s openness extends to the mission design. Side and main objectives are cleverly designed to not allow for failure. Allies are essentially invincible during escort missions and there’s never an arbitrary timer or zone you’re forced into. This freeform approach puts the emphasis on experimentation and removes the restrictive training wheels that ironically poison other open world games. And outside of a few scripted sequences, you’re never locked into one mission. You’re free to wander away from most objectives and do whatever you please. I’d regularly get distracted by hijackable convoys or huntable animals on my way to my next mission. Oftentimes, I’d get so far removed from my initial quest and forget what I was originally doing. Non-binding missions and the freedom to get lost and do whatever you want is incredibly liberating and is an attitude more open-world games should embrace.Sometimes, however, the game will ostensibly break its commitment to freedom and push you off the main path. Origins’ leveling system facilitates its expansive skill tree and gear system, but also serves as the means to artificially bar your progress. Quests have recommended levels attached to them and, while you technically can play those missions, you’ll run into absurdly high difficulty spikes if you’re underleveled. Regular guards will be extremely tough to kill and mini-bosses are almost invincible. You’ll probably find this out the hard way after a few deaths as you leave the mission area to grind experience elsewhere. While there is plenty of good side stuff to do, being forced to do them regularly to keep up feels out of place when considering the open philosophy surrounding the rest of the game.A lot of this review is framed within the context of Assassin’s Creed as a whole and its shortcomings, in a lot of ways, it has to be. A series can’t go on for ten years, take a break, and then return with almost all of the same damn issues. The extra year of development time paid off and ensured that Assassin’s Creed Origins likely wouldn’t underwhelm its audience by repeating its past sins. Instead, it modernized itself by adopting a more open structure and intuitive set of controls and gameplay systems, effectively marking a new chapter in the franchise. It’s fitting that Origins showed the birth of the Assassin’s Creed while also indicating the much-needed rebirth of the Assassin’s Creed series.Disclosure: GameRevolution attended an Assassin’s Creed Origins review event held by Ubisoft.9Michael Leri is Evolve's senior gaming editor.

Forbes,"Assassin's Creed OriginsWe have mercifully moved out of the brief phase where for a few years, Ubisoft thought they could turn Assassin’s Creed into an annualized franchise in the vein of Call of Duty, but that resulted in the burnout of both fans and the developers alike. Instead, the franchise has taken some time to regroup and come up with a new installment that will hopefully get people talking the game reverently the way they used to, before it slowly descended into becoming a mediocre meme factory.Assassin’s Creed Origins is a return to form, that much is clear. I’m still trying to puzzle out whether it could top AC2 or Black Flag, but even if it’s in third place behind those, it’s a solid third. Ubisoft got a lot right here, from simplifying systems that had grown unwieldy over the past few years, to learning lessons from other leaders in the genre. The Witcher 3’s influence in particular is noticeable in Assassin’s Creed Origins, though I would stop short of saying the two are of comparable quality. Still, ACO does many, many things right, and feels like the type of game fans will welcome with open arms, especially in an age when dedicated single player experiences are on somewhat shaky ground.The story of Assassin’s Creed Origins follows Bayek, a Siwa warrior and guardian of his little Egyptian village, who suffers a horrific tragedy at the hands of “The Order,” a mysterious group of masked influence-wielders who we see from the outset, already have their hands on an Apple of Eden and are beginning to understand what it can be used for.This is before the Assassins and Templars, as “Origins” implies, so Bayek and his warrior wife Aya are motivated purely by revenge, hunting down members of The Order who are all given cryptic codenames like The Scarab and The Hyena before their identities are revealed.To do this, Bayek explores a frankly astonishingly large map of Egypt, going from enormous ancient cities like Alexandria to tiny remote villages like his own. From the great pyramids of Giza (hiding skill points, if you read ancient tablets within them) to hidden caves that lead to expansive ruins.Assassin's Creed OriginsThis is, without question, one of the most impressive open world maps I’ve ever seen. The beauty of Egypt here is stunning, and the scale is mind-boggling. This is the magic of an Assassin's Creed game when it using its time-traveling, globe-hopping abilities to the fullest. After 40 or so hours there are still a number of sections of the map that remain blank and unexplored for me, not revealed by vision towers (which are now used purely as fast travel points instead), but by actually exploring them yourself.The sheer amount of stuff to do in Assassin’s Creed Origins is almost overwhelming, but nearly all the activities are engaging and rewarding, which is rarely true of games in this genre. You can raid tombs, as I mentioned, but also take over forts by assassinating commanders in silence, or mowing down the entire garrison. Packs of wild animals have alphas that need to be dispatched. Museums or warehouses have loot to be stolen. Riddles point to secrets in the desert that you will have to find with the aid of no map markers, but puzzle-solving and exploration alone.My favorite activity has probably been bounty hunter-hunting. Early in the story, you will piss off the wrong authority figure who will then send “Phylakes” after you, powerful, named bounty hunters who roam the map and will kill you on sight. Cause too much of a ruckus in one area, and they’ll be there soon enough. But you can turn the tables on them, track them stealthily with the aid of your eagle (who scouts everything in the game for you with its X-ray vision). You set traps for the Phylakes, ambush them with a rain of arrows or a drive-by horseback slashing or a streetside brawl, and if you manage to survive, walk away holding their legendary weapon.But all those are side activities. The focus on the game is on a nearly endless number of quests and side-quests. The main story is well-told, and Bayek is one of the more likable leads this series has had to date. The actual missions range from executing an unguarded Order member as they shuffle around a temple, to epic boss fights against a furious, fire-arrow-wielding woman with three trained hyenas trying to tear your apart in the middle of a sandstorm. It’s quite a range, and there continued to be diverse encounters throughout the course of the entire game.It’s the side-missions I found curious, as it’s where the influence of The Witcher 3 is obvious. Every side mission, and there are a zillion, is careful to have at least some semblance of a story attached to it. No two are the same, and even if they share components (rescue X person from this fort), they use them in unique ways. For example, I might be trying to get information about a nearby target, but this poor merchant can’t concentrate until I find his horse that’s wandered off. Instead, I find his horse has been taken by bandits inside a fortified camp, and after I trample over a dozen bodies and return it to him, I find out it wasn’t his horse after all, and I literally just stole it on his behalf. Kind of hilarious, and you meet a lot of quirky characters like that in these quests, like a young girl trying to sell me forged artifacts from my own hometown, and an over-the-hill gladiator who can’t find work that doesn’t involve cracking skulls. Even the way you get these quests can be creative, like when I tried to approach one marker which ceased to be stationary as I immediately had to catch a thieving child, chasing him across half the city in order for the quest to start.Assassin's Creed OriginsI see The Witcher in some of these, though there is no “Bloody Baron” equivalent, even if a few of these are multi-stage and continue on over the course of the game. Another big difference is that you, as Bayek, are never asked to make any difficult choices, and there are almost never repercussions for your actions. Tax collector harassing a poor family? Murder him. End of story. No bargaining with him, no framing him for a crime. Mostly just lots and lots of murder all around, and without the weight of any sort of decision making, many of these quests don’t feel that impactful the way you might see in narrative-branching RPGs where you’re constantly questioning whether or not you did the right thing or sided with the right party.So while there are some decently major story and activity questions, there are also some significant changes to combat and gameplay. Gone is much of the clutter of games past. No crafting your own custom grenades or hiring a Brotherhood to assassinate an entire battalion once you whistle. Just you, a collection of weapons and skills, and a lot of guys to kill.Open combat has adopted a modified approach to the past games which eventually devolved to “counter-kill 30 guards surrounding you one at a time.” It’s a bit of The Witcher blended with Dark Souls but more simplistic than either. A simple block break and a well-timed dodge will get you past pretty much all but the toughest of enemies. You can build up an adrenaline bar that turns into either a massive one-hit blow, or supercharges larger weapons, depending on what you’re using. There’s nothing super innovative here, and I felt like I was still missing some the nuances by the end, but I’d say it’s a marked improvement over past games.The bow selection took a while to get used to, but once you figure out the use for each type (rapid-fire, sniper, shotgun blast multi-arrow), it may turn into your go-to for many encounters. I also really, really like the new rarity system that has the traditional rare, epic, legendary structure that makes hunting for gear rewarding, like when you’re pulling Legendaries from dead commanders or bounty hunters. You feel like you earned those weapons, and even if their modifiers are simple (fire damage, increased critical hit), you can really feel the power differential when you get them. And if you like one, you don’t have to worry about out-leveling it as blacksmiths will let you bring any piece of gear up to your current level (for a hefty price).But that’s open combat, what about stealth? There are some pretty big changes there too, but not in the ways you might think.Stealth is now both easier and harder. Tools have been reduced in effectiveness somewhat, as you can’t just shoot a guy with a poison or rage dart from afar, you have to get up close and personal. Stealth archery is not terribly viable, and there’s not even a “kill two enemies standing next to each other” assassination anymore though, you can chain two stealth kills together with a throwing knife.Assassin's Creed OriginsBut stealth is easier in that the game is much more forgiving about attracting enemy attention. Simply put, enemies almost never raise a ruckus or sound the alarm unless you’re in an all-out brawl in the middle of a fortress, and even then, you can pretty easily flee and return to the shadows unseen to start picking people off once more. Enemies will only rarely find dead bodies, not spotting them from halfway across the map, and when they do, they don’t sprint for help, they just start creeping around and you can usually kill them easily. And in larger areas, you can screw up and openly engage one or two enemies and it won’t rile the rest of the camp if no one is in direct proximity to the fight. I think we all remember how crazy AC games would get where you would have literally four dozen guards chasing you mercilessly through the streets if you screwed up a stealth kill. In Assassin’s Creed Origins, that rarely happens, allowing you to not be caught as easily and to recover when you are. Usually this leads to more stealth gameplay and more successful attempts, even if stealth tools have been scaled back a bit.In short, Assassin’s Creed Origins feels like it’s stripped down systems that had gotten too complicated, and bolstered the game’s weak points with more involved side-quests and areas that you will actually be curious to explore. After the game’s main story is finished, the map is still covered in question marks and uncompleted quests. I…genuinely want to do them, rather than set this game down and immediately move on. That’s quite an accomplishment for a game I’ve already sunk 40 hours into.And yet I do wonder if the size is a bit much. I have started to clear so many forts and caves they’re all starting to blur together. And the main story felt like it was going to end about four different times only to have another few targets to hunt down. I thought I had hit the game’s ending when I was promised as “you can’t turn back now” moment, and played a 90 minute mission sequence that led to…yet even more open world gameplay, another lengthy act still on the horizon. At a certain point, it’s Return of the King syndrome, where it may be good but it’s just time for it to end already.Finally, the microtransactions. We weren’t going to get through a major AAA release without mentioning them, but fortunately, there’s little to say. You can technically buy loot boxes, because you can buy gold, which then buys loot boxes, but there’s no reason to do that because you can buy everything in the game with real life money. Literally everything from gold to skill points to map reveals to specific legendary weapons, outfits and mounts that you can otherwise earn in game. It’s the clearest example of literally paying for cheat codes I’ve ever seen in a game and for that reason it’s almost…harmless? You can skip the microtransactions altogether and not feel like you’re missing anything at all, and the store is not directly integrated into the core of the game like we see in Shadow of War, so it’s not even in your face taunting you. As systems like this go, even for as much as it offers, this one is pretty toothless, and I like it for that.Assassin’s Creed Origins improves from its past few installments in almost every way, yet it never quite reaches the heights of the games it tries to emulate. Its combat isn’t Dark Souls level. Its quests aren’t The Witcher 3 level. Its open world isn’t…well honestly, this might actually be one of the most impressive virtual spaces I’ve ever seen, so credit where it’s due there. I do have to imagine that if you ever have loved a game in the Assassin’s Creed series that you’ll enjoy what Origins does here, but also if you don’t have 60+ hours to sink into a game as absolutely massive as this one, I don’t blame you either. But I enjoyed my time with it, more so than I was even expecting, having thought I had burned out on this franchise for good.Platform: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PCDeveloper: Ubisoft MontrealPublisher: UbisoftRelease Date: Oct. 27, 2017Price: $59.99Score: 9.25 out of 10(Review code provided by Ubisoft)Follow me on Twitter and on Facebook.

This year’s helping of the Ubisoft open world game is the same as it ever was while also being just fresh enough and so impossibly extravagant that it has managed to change the overall perception of this reviewer who was incredibly hostile to the idea of playing the game in the first place.I played and mostly enjoyed the first 2 Assassin’s Creed games when they released. I passed on the subsequent entries until Black Flag came along and allowed me to escape secret societies and earthy-toned city streets for a chance to live life like a pirate. My adoration for Black Flag led to my strong anticipation for Assassin’s Creed: Unity, but it only took about 2 hours of troubleshooting technical issues in Paris before I uninstalled. I couldn't be bothered to care about Syndicate and felt similarly when I saw the debut of this year’s entry during E3. When I found out that I would be reviewing the new Assassin’s Creed game, I was excited. Excited like they way I’m excited by the thought of getting a colonoscopy.I could rattle off details about how the game is structured or take the time time to explain each of the newest features of Assassin’s Creed: Origins (ACO for short), but most folks already know all of this or know which wiki to find it from. What is the hook this year? Egypt. It’s somewhere in Africa and in ACO, it appears the the Greeks are running Bordertown. The stuff you’d expect is present and accounted for, like the pyramids at Giza or scattered hieroglyphics. Being set around 50 years prior to the birth of Christ, all those famous symbols of ancient Egypt are already worn down or nearing burial from the sands of time. The land is ruled under the hand of Ptolemy XIII and loosely goes into all his business with his sister Cleopatra and their involvement with Julius Caesar and Pompey the Great.Everything plays out through the perspective of a fellow named Bayek, who is forced into the life of slicing fools and climbing things as the result of a tragic family event. Admittedly, I don’t remember any of the characters from previous Assassin’s Creed games other than that present-day guy who looked like Frankie Carbone with a shaved head, but Bayek seems like the best of the bunch. I found it rather easy to buy into his plight and did not feel the urge to skip past his cutscenes.Honestly, it took close to 4 hours before I stopped loathing my time spent with ACO and started legitimately enjoying myself. The game is rotten with cliche open world busy work. You have to climb towers that reveal more busy work and serve to make the already cluttered HUD become even more messy. You have some sort of spirit eagle that is intended to help you overcome the adversity, but in practice, the bird is simply a predator drone that a multicultural team of various faiths and beliefs hotglued feathers to. Every encounter puts a gold blip on your HUD and the moment you get near it, the game pesters you to call in the eagle drone, which shows you everything and 3D highlights any possible enemy or surprise. This takes much of the discovery out of the experience, but without it, the game would likely take 300 years to complete.Combat is improved over what was seen in Assassin’s Creed Unity, but that doesn’t really mean much. It is less reliant on Arkham Asylum-style counters and warping animations, which is nice, but it still feels lacking. Default button assignments on the gamepad elicit comparison to Dark Souls, with a light attack on the right bumper, heavy attack on the right trigger, and shield on the left bumper. Parrying is done with a face button rather than the left trigger, so it can’t be labeled a straight copy. Unfortunately, in practice, the combat is nowhere near as smooth or rewarding as what you get from a Souls game. The only time I really felt engaged with the system was during fights with some top-tier bounty hunters known as Phylakes.The game world in ACO is enormous. Featuring a map that is much more spread out than in previous entries, the game is less about scaling townhouses and cathedrals and more about cameling yourself to each objective. For me, this is a welcome change. Climbing buildings and towers is dope as hell, but not after you do it 200 times. ACO ushers you from location to location at a breakneck pace and you never feel like you are navigating the same building over and over.In my opinion, Egypt is the star of the show and the only real reason to hop into game if you aren’t a series diehard that was going to buy it anyway. Having not personally spent time in the setting since Sierra’s excellent Egyptian RTS games of the late 90s, I found stabbing people along the run of the Nile to be a real treat. It doesn’t hurt that the game is absolutely gorgeous. The models, textures, and shaders work together to bring the world to life. Lighting is as good as anything I’ve seen in videogames and is as good as or better than what was seen in Uncharted 4. Dawn and dusk are simply breathtaking. Everything looks so good that it makes the jerky animations stand out like a sore thumb, ACO is not the only game that suffers this issue now that we live in a world where every AAA game looks really good. I feel it should be repeated - ACO looks REALLY good.I dislike so many parts of the game. Giant chunks of it are littered with tired mechanics and missions filled with tedium. I even experienced the patented Assassin’s Creed PC version at launch problems. It has a real money store where you can buy in-game credits to speed up your progress and some of the progression makes me feel like it was engineered to get me to buy these credits. ACO has almost everything going against it, and somehow managed to win me over. Just moving along in the game world is rewarding on its own.I’m not sure how Ubisoft can be making a profit selling this game for $60. It looks like they spent $100 million+ on the production (and they probably did) ensuring that every part of the world was as opulent as the Egyptian ruling culture it portrays. The microtransactions are probably required for Ubisoft to make up the shortfall from selling such an exquisite world for such a pittance. I honestly can’t blame them. I do wish that the game had been $80 and balanced away from selling extra stuff, but it is what it is. I can't eloquently explain why I like it so much after spending most of my words rattling off negatives. I just like it. If you want to escape into the best Assassin’s Creed world in the series, this is the ticket. 8/10 hidden tomb cobrasThis review is based on the PC Uplay release.

Glistening sands and teaming life stretch far away. I stand at the head of a gilded Pyramid, looking away to the bustling lives and vibrant oases around me. Dust curls up along the horizon, eager to embrace a nearby village. Hippos lumber around the beaches, warding off wary intruders with their girth. This is ancient Egypt not as we imagine it—a popularized image of endlessly mythologized figures—but closer to Egypt as it really might have been. It's lush and vibrant, harsh and unforgiving; a land of scoped mystery, steeped in blood.Ubisoft has plenty of experience replicating realistic (or at least realistic-esque) worlds like these throughout the Assassin’s Creed series. The mega-developer's latest tentpole, Assassin's Creed: Origins, continues the tradition. The attention to detail is exceptional, and here that's no mere quip about superficial beauty. Like a digital museum, great care has been spent curating the fineries and looks and culture of its disparate corners. Indeed, Ubisoft has already announced a “Discovery Mode” update, coming next year, that literally turns the game into a digital museum, allowing visitors to rifle through relics and records, pyramids and obelisks to learn about the mores and traditions of the people who lived there.For now, though, Origins is more of a known quantity, a rough assemblage of the cornucopia of ideas that have settled into the popular consciousness of what games need to be (side missions, gathering, crafting, stealth sections, and so forth). As such, Origins has a sort of crushing variety, for better and worse.As in the many preceding Assassin’s Creed games, you assume the role of a skilled assassin. This time you’re Bayek, who lived two millennia ago as the last of the medjay—an ancient paramilitary order whose real-world counterpart all but vanished after 1000 BCE. He's charismatic and brutal, a rough-hewn product of his torturous life. Packed with rage and desperate for revenge—as these heroes always are—you follow Bayek as he treks across Northern Africa hunting a string of targets.Trope-laden as the set-up may be, Bayek is far more charismatic and rounded than many previous series protagonists. Origins weights his quest with many believable instances of injustice, such as greedy landlords abusing their power. Even so, playing Bayek isn't about a never-ending rage-fueled bloodbath, either. He quips, share drinks with friends, and makes nice with children. It creates the unsettling air that he's always bubbling, just beneath the surface, ready to explode and unleash a caged beast.That rage becomes an important and enduring theme throughout the game. Bayek's anger is righteous, yes, but it's also clearly hard-to-control and self-destructive. Even that bare level of nuance is surprising and refreshing in a major release like this.Much of the adventure centers on tracking your targets and navigating the political tumult of the era. This is Classical Egypt in its waning years, thousands of years from the time of the pyramids' construction, and long after the glory of the Egyptian Empire hit its peak. Naturally, Bayek finds himself at the fulcrum of history, adjusting the balance of power in the region—often unintentionally—in ways that leave their mark for millennia to come.There's a charming, popcorny grandeur to it all that dovetails well with the game's extensive playground. Watching camels plod about with the golden peak of Giza in the backdrop, or seeing the rolling waves that reach for the horizon, carrying whole fleets of triremes is like something out of a book, evoking an impossible era that seems mystical only because of its distance from the modern.Alien-obsessed conspiracy theorists notwithstanding, the game helps lead to a genuine realization that people—real human beings—built some of these gargantuan structures and, moreover, that such landmarks were well-integrated facets of ancient life. This alone is a revelation that comes in waves and curdles as a lasting marvel at our long-dead progenitors.What really hampers this adventure is how often the game trips over itself, hamstrung by the endless string of tasks you're given. This is still an open-world game, and while great care has been taken to make much of its ""content"" engaging, it's also got sterling ideas stretched far too thin.As but one example, like in Horizon: Zero Dawn before it, you'll spend a fair bit of time hunting for materials—be they leather or bone. You can then refine them into more useful tools or clothing for protection. The whole system is clever enough. Bayek can send a trained eagle to scout and mark fruitful hunting spots. This gives you a top-down view of the area, an objective, and a motivation to get there (gathering so that you can produce better equipment). That sounds like it's all you need—means, motive, opportunity—but all of the goals are extrinsic and don't align with the thirst for exploration that such lush riversides and mysterious deserts invite. Instead, you're led to grind for more and more, without cause or motivation.Much of Assassin's Creed: Origins can feel mindless, then, as if you're merely checking boxes and moving on—a problem the series has perennially struggled with. Some of those checkboxes, like traversing the land and immersing yourself in a nearly-breathing recreation of the Ancient, are phenomenal. They’re only made more so when you get the opportunity to rub shoulders with important real-world figures like Cleopatra. Others, like clearing out enemy bases, are just the opposite.To its credit, however, Origins dramatically overhauls the Assassin's Creed formula, making even the dull bits far more entertaining than in some of its prior iterations. The series' signature parkour has evolved into an even more freeflowing and natural exercise than ever. These worlds feel seamless and far less game-y as a result. The impression is one of infinite possibilities, just waiting to be unearthed as opposed to being a guided tour that highlights a chosen path.Combat, too, has picked up a major rework. Your fights—both with your assassination targets and the guards as you're making your escape—have been honed to be more tactical endeavors. Positioning and focus matter. Bouts are largely duels, with you squaring off against only a couple of foes, often in succession. It's ordered without feeling rigid, and some spectacular animation work lends itself to fluid, almost artful dances with blades and knives.Still, there’s a persistent clash between what the game wants you to do and what's actually entertaining to do in its well-crafted world. Then there's another major flaw here: bugs. The game is gorgeous, yes, but too often the pace crawls as standard consoles struggle to keep up with the demanding environments. (We didn't get the chance to play on PC, so we can't account for performance there. Nor can we vouch for the PS4 Pro or Xbox One X versions.)Despite this, Origins is a triumph, of sorts. The feeling of perusing the ancient world in this fidelity is special on its own, and one of the best examples yet for a game's visual beauty alone being a stunning, inspirational experience. But, far too often that gives ground to more traditionally game-y bits that dilute Origins' best moments.Verdict: A shining example of what exploration-based games can be, dropping many of its franchise’s worst traits even while being sometimes held back by the mundane.

VG247,"Assassin’s Creed Origins is a triumphant return for a franchise that was tottering about with fatigue just two years ago.Prior to playing Assassin’s Creed Origins, I believed the series needed drastic change – a full rethink, a reboot, and ruthless surgery of the many Frankenstein features sewn on there over the years. This has not happened, but that’s okay: turns out what Assassin’s Creed and the people who make it really needed was a rest.In the three years between Assassin’s Creed Unity and Origins, Ubisoft Montreal has doubled down on the two things that make Assassin’s Creed great: an interesting, quasi-systemic open world and a busy and varied player toolbox. It has also foregrounded progression, eliminated frustrations, squashed technical issues, tightened up its storytelling and taken a good long look at the bar set by rival titles this generation. I'm not finished with it yet, because it's sodding ginormous, but it's already clear the results are fantastic. 
 
One of the reasons Assassin’s Creed Origins is great is that Ptolemaic Egypt is just wild. The clash of Egyptian cultures with Greek occupiers grants us diverse aesthetics, a huge cast of interesting characters, the buzz of multiple languages and loads of interesting history and mythology to gawk at and learn from. Historical tourism, one of the franchise’s first pillars, is at its best here (mileage will vary for Egyptian players).Ubisoft has filled the dauntingly enormous world up with impressive architectural sites; dramatic landscapes; and busy hubs. The environment is much more varied than you might expect, and is peppered with tombs, monuments, temples, shrines, caves, oases and verticality. Also, the weather does some amazing things.Ubisoft has sensibly included a photo mode, and you can opt in to automatically share and receive photos taken by others. This is a great way to highlight the work, but also to point players at locations they might otherwise overlook. Very clever. 
 
The real joy is in what goes on out there, though; Assassin’s Creed Origins is a real water cooler game. Matt and I have been exchanging little notes, but even so, it’s been really hard not to throw the embargo to the wind and tweet wildly about my adventures, as I am eaten by a new and terrible kind of animal or stumble across fascinating little gems out in the middle of nowhere. I don’t want to spoil these, but I urge you to read any notes you find. They’re all very short, showing an unusual respect for your time, and some of them will lead you to good times as well as having their own interest.Unscripted good times emerge as you unlock new skills and play around with the many tools at your disposal – or just when the game’s systems do their thing. As in Far Cry, animals are a frequent cause of hilarious upset, and fans of the shooter series may be pleased to know you can do some interesting things with fire in Assassin’s Creed Origins, too. Tools and abilities like sleep darts, corpse traps, and turning enemies or animals to your side combine with the bow and Hidden Blade to make stealth less about patiently ghosting and more about what you can get away with in the generous gaps in the AI’s perception. The chaos you can unleash while chortling undetected in the bushes makes up for the way the series has leaned away from the challenging but repetitive stealth mechanics of the early games.When stealth fails, there’s always fighting. Combat has been retooled a little, but holds on to an essential formula of positioning to avoid pincer attacks, dodging or blocking until you see an opening, and then switching between guard-breaking heavy blows and quick attacks to bring down foes. You can use tools to secure an edge, and two of the categories of bow are designed for use between melee attacks, but that one-on-one duelling core remains. Get a good sword. 
 
The weapon loot cycle and your level play a very important role in gating, since enemies do not scale. The good news is that XP rains down on you with the slightest step off the main quest path, and while the loot is RNG-based there’s enough of it scattered about in crates in mission locations that there’s really no need to shop or go treasure hunting as long as you’re levelling up and remembering to swap in more powerful weapons. A very simple vendor-based upgrade system means any rare blades you find can be easily boosted to be relevant at higher levels, and it’s pretty easy to track down materials for crafting upgrades for your other gear. I’m only at level 20 at time of writing, but I’m yet to hit a grind and can’t see any reason to visit the microtransaction store – or even the in-game vendors.The gating is strict, as high-level enemies will humble you, but mainly seems to exist to stop you exhausting yourself trying to fill out everything on the map. On that note, completing main quest and major side missions on your path will generally guide you around a region or group of regions in a way that avoids backtracking or long periods of empty travel, and allows you to fill out the majority of points of interest as you pass them. It makes it all feel less like a chore. 
 
Traversal is also less of a slog thanks to improved climbing. Bayek can scamper up nearly any surface, making exploration even of towering cliffs fast, fluid and fun. He also has fewer moments of confusion, and while I can’t say it’s been perfect, there’s less screeching “go through the window you shithead, no not that ledge, the other ledge, why are you leaping into space” than with previous Assassin’s Creed protagonists. Technical issues and glitches in general, I am pleased to report, seem to be few and far between. Nobody’s face has come off, that’s for sure.This is an extra pleasant change because the cutscenes and dialogue are quite good, once you get over everyone saying “By Sekhmet” and other ancient exclamations and get down to learning new swear words from the (excellent, full-featured) subtitles. The story is easy to follow but not uninteresting, and what I really like is that Bayek generally has a good motivation for doing everything, including side missions. As a sort of community cop with friends everywhere and deep respect for religious traditions, it makes perfect sense for him to drop his non time-critical main quest to right an injustice or retrieve someone’s fallen pal. It feels a lot less like the master assassin, running off to do murderous errands for whatever rando stops him in the street. 
 
Finally, the whole thing is beautifully polished and does not feel dated, as Unity and Syndicate did. Assassin’s Creed Origins is clearly the product of a generation that has given us open world rivals like The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Horizon: Zero Dawn and even Destiny (love that menu cursor!) and has risen to meet and sometimes even exceed the standards set by these competitors while staying faithful to the franchise’s core strengths.Assassin’s Creed Origins is not a dramatic departure from the formula as we last saw it, but manages to be much more fun and feel way more fresh than any entry since Brotherhood and Black Flag. It plays to the strengths of a genre Ubisoft helped bring into the mainstream, respects the player and their freedom, and allows them to beat up crocodiles. I’m into it.Tested on the PlayStation 4.
