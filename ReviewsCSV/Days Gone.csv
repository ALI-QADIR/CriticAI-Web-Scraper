Link Official siteAn outlaw biker drifting through a Pacific Northwestern post-apocalypse is a killer premise, and Days Gone occasionally lives up to it. When you're alone on the broken road, riding your scrappy motorcycle between missions, it's easy to get swept up in the apocalyptic romanticism of it all. It's just you, your bike, and an unforgiving land. No job, no bills—just two wheels, a thirsty gas tank, and all the time in the (end of the) world.You play as Deacon St. John, a young Oregon biker who wears a backwards baseball cap at all times—even at his wedding. Two years after a mysterious outbreak has turned half the population of America into zombie-like cannibals called freakers, Deacon embarks on a quest to find his missing wife, Sarah. There are other stories too, including discovering the truth about the pandemic—because there's always a truth behind these things. But it's reuniting with his beloved spouse that really drives our anti-hero.Days Gone is an open world game, set across a large swathe of the American Pacific Northwest. It's a sweeping, rugged landscape, with old-growth forests, cascading waterfalls, dusty stretches of desert, one-horse towns, and kitschy motels. It's a completely boilerplate zombie apocalypse, decorated with the End of Days Starter Kit: abandoned government checkpoints, mass graves, gutted houses, car tunnels stuffed with wrecks, and so on. But it's all well presented and often extremely atmospheric—especially when the sky turns a gloomy slate-grey and the rain and thunder roll in.Your bike is your life in Days Gone, and keeping it running is a full-time job. As you ride from place to place you burn gas, which means scavenging for fuel when the tank inevitably runs dry. If you crash hard or you're ambushed by opportunistic bandits, you have to gather scrap, another valuable resource, to repair it. It's a very basic simulation of motorcycle maintenance, but it means there's more to every long distance trip than just slamming the throttle and tuning out until you reach the objective marker.Your bike is your life in Days Gone, and keeping it running is a full-time jobPopping open the hoods of abandoned cars to yank out scrap or dodging zombies to duck into roadside garages and hunt for gasoline is a satisfying loop—although it can be frustrating if you just want to quickly get to the next mission. You can fast travel, provided you have enough gas and the road ahead is clear of freaker nests (which you can clear out with a Molotov.) But I always resist the urge, realising that riding between jobs, enjoying the scenery, and tinkering with my bike is where Days Gone is at its best—and everything else is just disappointing.On a grand scale, when it's speeding past you in a blur, the world is great. But whenever I stopped to take a closer look, there was never anything interesting to find—just empty rooms, swarms of freakers, and a stingy scattering of generic crafting loot. This is a world with no stories to tell, and it's always deflating when you see a building on the side of the road, pull up, nose around inside, and leave with no deeper understanding of the outbreak and no insight into the people who lived there. Beyond the eternal hunt for fuel and scrap, exploration is pointless, which makes the world feel dead.As for the actual missions, they're an underwhelming mix of stealth and cover-based shooting. Stealth involves crouching in conveniently placed waist-high bushes, waiting for enemies to pass, then stabbing them violently in the head. You also have to watch out for bear traps and tripwires that'll give away your position, and can throw rocks as a distraction. It's incredibly basic stuff, with no unique systems to experiment with, and some very skittish, unconvincing AI—whether you're sneaking past freakers or humans.If you get spotted (or, as is more likely, bored of creeping around), Days Gone turns into a cover shooter that is, unfortunately, every bit as pedestrian as the stealth is. The character movement is lethargic, the guns are unexciting, and once again, the dim AI means there's no real sense of danger or urgency to the firefights. I do like the melee combat, though. When you whack a bandit or a freaker with a large, heavy piece of wood, or a makeshift machete created out of an old lawnmower blade, you can really feel it.Everyone you meet in Days Gone is either miserable, dying, or trying to kill youThere are more than 150 missions to complete in the game, a mix of story and side missions. But even if you just doggedly pursue the story and ignore everything else on offer, you're still looking at 35-40 hours of game here, which is way too much. I have no problem with long open world games. I mean, I've played through the immense Red Dead Redemption 2 twice. But the missions in Days Gone just aren't varied enough—nor is the story interesting enough—to justify its length.There are some standout moments, though. In one especially tense mission, Deacon is kidnapped by a fanatical self-mutilating death cult called the Rippers and has to sneak and shoot his way out of their creepy compound. I just wish there were more memorable moments like this.Days Gone is also deeply joyless, with a grim, self-serious tone a story about apocalyptic bikers with names like 'Boozeman' really shouldn't have. Everyone you meet is either miserable, dying, or trying to kill you. The flashbacks to Deacon and Sarah's pre-pandemic relationship are overly sentimental. And Deacon himself, who is mostly angry and monosyllabic, is hard to love. Days Gone thinks being 'mature' means snuffing out all traces of warmth and humour from its story—even though people in a world like this would depend on these things even more to cling to their dwindling humanity.But hey, the PC version is pretty good. With an RTX 2080 Super and an i7-9700K, I was able to play in 1440p at max settings with a completely stable frame rate—even with hundreds of freakers filling the screen. I had to knock a few settings down for a smooth experience in 4K, but nothing that majorly affected the quality of the image. It is, however, missing a few things we've come to expect from modern PC games—namely DLSS and raytracing. It's a pretty game, but it won't make a high-end graphics card sweat.Days Gone is a fun post-apocalyptic road trip simulator, but the things it does well are ultimately overwhelmed by the dreary story, repetitive missions, sluggish controls, and lifeless world. It's great seeing more PlayStation exclusives coming to PC, and long may that continue. But if Days Gone hadn't made the transition, I don't think it would have been a great loss for the platform. Look, just play Avalanche's Mad Max game from 2015 instead. It does everything Days Gone does, but with a sense of humour, a wasteland that's actually worth exploring, and you get to be the road warrior Max Rockatansky instead of a sad, mumbling biker in a backwards baseball cap.Riding and maintaining your bike is great—the boring world, dull missions, and overly serious tone, not so much.If it’s set in space, Andy will probably write about it. He loves sci-fi, adventure games, taking screenshots, Twin Peaks, weird sims, Alien: Isolation, and anything with a good story.Wordle today: Hint and answer #861 for Saturday, October 28South Park makes Baldur's Gate 3 joke, Larian quickly corrects itThe Finals is a potentially incredible FPS stuck in the body of a sweaty esportBy Katie Wickens18 October 2023By Jacob Ridley17 October 2023By Noah Smith16 October 2023By Ian Evenden13 October 2023By Tom Hatfield12 October 2023By Harvey Randall12 October 2023By Rick Lane10 October 2023By Jorge Jimenez9 October 2023By Jacob Ridley5 October 2023By Phil Iwaniuk4 October 2023By Dave James4 October 2023PC Gamer is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Eurogamer,"Oregon trial.From the moment I first heard about Days Gone, I wondered about its reason for existing. With so many open-world titles and games that use post-apocalyptic setting featuring zombies and/or other types of deformed creatures, why make another one? Maybe someone at Sony was looking at Horizon Zero Dawn, first announced around the time that work on Days Gone officially began, and said right girls, you've had your metaphorical glass of 'secco with this one, let's make a post-apocalyptic game for real men. Maybe someone looked at all these other existing titles and thought why not make another - people keep buying them, they'll buy this one, too. But there are only so many times that works. In Days Gone, you can see why.Days Gone starts with a familiar scene. We meet Deacon St. John and his wife Sarah in Seattle, the streets filled with panicked people and overturned vehicles. You don't yet see what everyone is running from, but of course you know - this is a zombie game, get with the programme. Accompanying the two is Deacon's best friend Boozer. He seems to exist for one reason only - to justify why Deacon would leave his wife after she's gravely wounded in an act of violence so senseless it literally doesn't make sense. I've watched it over several times, not least because the game makes you reminisce about it more than once, and the big moment that defines nearly the story just doesn't add up.Sarah (seemingly?) dies. This is not a spoiler, because it's so essential to Days Gone it's alluded to in the marketing materials. I'm glad to say that after everything games have done in recent years to establish women, in Days Gone we're back to them existing entirely to enable the male protagonist's pain. This isn't helped by Sarah coming across as a woman who seems to be as dumb as bricks for most of the flashbacks. Take her first meeting with Deacon. She is out in the mountains with a broken car and no phone reception when a stranger on a bike stops and aggressively asks her for directions, before pretending to drive off so she has to ask him for help. No woman would ever. If a woman would in fact ever, she would then proceed to fling herself off Deacon's bike as soon as the words ""so what's a nice lady like you doing in a place like this"" leave his mouth.Maybe someone at Sony was looking at Horizon Zero Dawn and said, right girls, you've had your metaphorical glass of 'secco with this one, let's make a post-apocalyptic game for real men.Several years after the incident we're back with Deacon and Boozer, hunting down a guy on their bikes. It's a fun intro that gave me a lot of hope, because manoeuvring through the forest without hitting a tree while shooting at someone is always fun - it was fun in Uncharted, it was fun in Far Cry and it's certainly fun here. For all that I'm busy with dodging trees, it's also immediately obvious that virtual Oregon is a beautiful place. Whether during the downpours or in the snow, it's frequently breathtaking.  This first mission introduces you to all Days Gones' tricks in short order. You chase a guy, track him down once he's wounded and meet your first zombies, called freakers this time around. Freakers exhibit more animal-like behaviour by being out during both day and night and by building nests. If you want to reduce the concentration of enemies in an area, you need to burn these nests by chucking a Molotov cocktail at them and shooting the small horde of zombies that comes rushing out at you.This mission type introduces you to the crafting wheel for the first time. Most items in Days Gone are either crafted or found. You can craft healing items, bombs like the molotovs, traps and ammo for special weapons like your crossbow. There's a great selection of weapons on offer, and trying them and the traps out in a variety of ways keeps combat interesting. You collect ears from killed freakers, which work as the game's currency. At camps you can use that to buy parts for your bike, weapons or items.This is all standard stuff, so let's address the big, roaring elephant in the room. I'm of course talking about the bike. The bike is what's meant to set Days Gone apart from other open-world games since it's your only means of transport and your way of life. Biker's gon' bike. It's frankly a major source of tedium, and if Deacon didn't love it so much I would've abandoned it in the first lake I drove it into.The bike you own at the start of the game is stolen and parted out, so you have to start from scratch. Successfully finished missions reward you with paints, custom decals and other cosmetics, meanwhile you'll have to spend some of your hard-earned ears on upgrading the engine to allow for more quiet driving, the tank for reduced fuel consumption and the tires for better traction. I can't say that any of these upgrades made much difference, likely deliberately so. Days Gone wants you to consider the time of day to drive so you'll come across fewer zombies, which means the engine is always going to attract zombies you swerve around on the street, and you're supposed to plan your route carefully to include stops for fuel and avoid just pelting down a mountain range to take a shortcut. Falls from any height and crashes will damage your bike; you can collect scrap to repair it on the go or pay a mechanic to fix it. If your bike lands in a body of water, the engine dies immediately. If it's too deep you also won't be able to retrieve it, which means you'll have to walk the entire way to a settlement, on foot, to pay a mechanic to get it back for you. Oh, you don't have enough currency? Well, you better jog to a nest of freakers then to grind for some ears! To be fair, this happens very rarely. What happens a lot, though, is you nervously staring at your tank metre or sneaking an extra victory lap around a combat area to find a canister of petrol because you just run out so incredibly fast. Main story locations will provide you with canisters, so they're not super rare, and I know refuelling is meant to aid realism, but it's just not fun. Having to park your bike a sufficient distance away to not get killed immediately and then having to run back during a few missions that take you across large distances without your bike also isn't fun. Walking your empty bike isn't fun - it means certain death if a horde of zombies is on your tail.Apart from their nest-building, freakers don't differ from other game zombies in any meaningful way. They're devastating in hordes, a bit laughable on their own. You'll likely take down most of them with melee weapons, as they're more common than ammo and because freakers are quite fast.  You're frequently encouraged to sneak around large groups, which is when the AI regularly just stops playing nice. Here I am, several feet away, my noise metre shows me I'm completely silent, when suddenly, out of nowhere, raaah!  At other times I'm convinced they're popping up out of nowhere, because my proximity radar on the mini map will show nothing, I've turned around several times and should see a freaker running at me, and yet I hear them gobbling, swing my bat in a random direction and meet a decaying head as if by accident.There are so many freaker nests, too. Most of the time can't clear all nests in one area at once because you need ammo to kill that many, so you maybe do one or two whenever you pass them on the road, but don't do it en route to a main mission, because you'll use all of your ammo, and on the way back you'll likely have used all of your resources in a big fight, so when to do this type of mission that amounts to you standing in front of a house and emptying all of your magazines into a horde? Never isn't an option, because until you clean out the nearby nests you won't be able to fast-travel to important places nearby. It just makes me feel actively punished for not wanting to engage in a type of mission that's just no fun.Everything I've talked about here, the chases, sneaking, camps, nests, is side mission stuff that appears in the main mission in exactly the same way, in several instances even in the same environments because the map isn't as big as it looks. Any game I can name you that shares similarities with Days Gone - Far Cry, The Last of Us, Horizon Zero Dawn, Shadows of Mordor, Shadow of the Tomb Raider - has managed to adapt familiar mechanics in their main missions to introduce some variety. Not so Days Gone, where you will be doing the exact same thing, in the exact same way, for hours on end. It's likely that at one point you will have to pick up a side mission just to grind, too, because resources you can pick up in the world will get tight at some point, making you dependant on currency. What's more, you'll only be able to buy certain things such as bandages once you raise a camp's trust level, which you do by - all together now - completing side missions. This can of course be perfectly enjoyable, I've played many a game this way, never bothering with the main story, just clearing out camps and such for a bit each evening, but if you want to continue on with the main story and the game forces your hand in this way it just gets very frustrating, very quickly.The bike is what's meant to set Days Gone apart from other open-world games since it's your only means of transport and your way of life. It's frankly a major source of tedium.When you're not fighting freakers you're fighting infected animals or marauders and rippers, the human enemy types in Days Gone. I liked the suitably horror-tinged introduction to the infected birds, but most other enemy types just turn up in a mission. Marauders set up camps for you to take out, and human enemies behave in more varied ways from freakers, which makes fights against them more interesting. I particularly liked fighting humans on stormy nights, when their flashlights blind you, and I cackled with glee every time I attracted freakers to chokepoints to do the dirty work for me. Narratively, your reason for clearing out camps is them encroaching on territory belonging to the camps you're aligned with, and because those murder hobos, unlike you, aren't nice people. See Far Cry. Marauders also set up traps on the open road, preferably when you're just coming back from a main mission and have no ammo left. Ngh.Rippers meanwhile look and behave like the War Boys from Mad Max, which should be enough of a reason to kill them, and it's also the only reason you're getting, so chop chop. This isn't a point of criticism I only level at Days Gone, by the way, I'd always enjoy more of a reason for virtual mass killing than ""they bad"", but Days Gone in particular is so shadowy about its motivations that Deacon froth up in a rage at seeing Rippers before you even find out who they are.Which brings me to the story. Deacon St. John, save for his bandana which he wears at his own wedding, is kind of a nothing. He either says ""Sonofabitch"" to express any and all emotions or spells everything out, from the plot you've just witnessed to his own feelings: ""I care because I feel like it was my fault."" Days Gone tells you either everything or nothing, but it's never subtle, never lets you uncover anything for yourself.Deacon tracks the local shadowy pharmaceutical corp, which Sarah used to work for, to find out what happened to her. When he witnesses Nero experimenting with freakers, he seizes a chance to continue the investigation. That in itself is ok as far as plots go, it's just that in order to stretch that across a game you're regularly sidetracked by stuff no one cares about. You're chasing a lead, but before you do that you first have to go back to a camp to do a fetch quest. Then there's the fact that there's not that many people to talk to who don't actively want to kill Deacon. Boozer has fulfilled his role in the exposition, so Deacon gets his own personal young woman to protect named Lisa, who is modelled like a short 20-year old but talks like a 6-year old who got hit in the head. The reason Deacon cares about her? She allegedly looks like Sarah's sister, which is never addressed in-game, just stuffed into a mission description. After you've temporarily dropped Lisa off somewhere, there is an entire story mission which you drive from one end of the map to the other only to witness this legendary exchange:Here are your EXP, thanks for playing! Days Gone carries with it the expectation that if you cobble a game together from parts of other games that are already massively successful, you'll have yourself a winner, but it has no awareness of why these games were successful, or simply no means to replicate them. I'm not sure whether you should blame a troubled production process, which Days Gone definitely had, for the state of the game or if it's just an attempt to hoodwink you into paying for a game you've already played several times over. I wasn't expecting Days Gone to add anything new to the genre, but both in terms of its systems and its story it's uninspired, which is driven home by the fact that it's endlessly, needlessly long. I'm begging you, haven't we done this enough?

Metro GameCentral,"The biggest PlayStation 4 exclusive of the year is filled with zombies, bikers, and an unfortunate sense of déjà vu.It’s very likely that you’ve got completely the wrong idea about Days Gone. If you’ve seen all the footage of giant hordes of zombies roaming around an open world then you might reasonably assume that they were the focus of the game’s story and gameplay. But they’re not. For the vast majority of the time you’re only dealing with small groups of the undead and frequently none at all. Days Gone is certainly not what we expected and picking through whether that’s a good or a bad thing is surprisingly difficult.The closest comparison by far for Days Gone is Red Dead Redemption II. From the similar (but nowhere near as pretty) open world environment to the simple gameplay mechanics and constant talking while you’re riding to and from missions, the similarities are strikingly obvious – even the use of music is the same. Which is surprising, in that Days Gone has been in development for six years and Rockstar’s sequel didn’t come out until right at the end of that.Of course, the original Red Dead Redemption was around before that and either way Rockstar’s games are far from the only obvious influence at work. At times (the first 10 hours in particular) Days Gone seems like just a bland mis-mash of every open world game ever made, but eventually it finds its own voice, even if it doesn’t have quite the range you’d hope for.Days Gone casts you as the improbably named Deacon St. John, a relatively good-hearted biker who is a bit of an ass but never in an extreme enough manner to be actively interesting. The game opens with him, his wife Sarah, and his best friend Boozer attempting to escape a zombie outbreak, which ends with the apparent death of Sarah and the two bikers taking up the life of drifters in a post-apocalyptic wasteland where absolutely everybody has a motorcycle.Once the game proper begins Boozer is immediately injured. And while there’s some concern that he may get blood poisoning you begin to realise that one of the game’s main faults is its aimless and meandering storyline. Thematically, Days Gone tries to play up the traditional zombie movie conceit that it’s humans that are the real monsters, but it doesn’t do so in any new or interesting manner.Days Gone clearly wants to take itself seriously but it lacks any real grit and even things like there being a class of child zombie never has the shock value it should. The dialogue is all very dry and unengaging, and the game is not even remotely scary – and we don’t think it’s even trying to be.There’s an attempt to reuse some familiar movie tropes and stock characters, particularly towards the end of the game, but they’re handled poorly, with not nearly enough depth in their characterisation. Similarly, there’s some vague attempts to dabble in gender politics, but the game doesn’t commit to it and by the end you’re just rescuing the princess as usual.The mechanics and key gameplay elements are each introduced fairly gracefully but they’re so generic that if you’ve played any open world game in the last 10 years you’ll instantly feel at home. Stealth is a little more important than most similar games, but it’s no more complicated than just crouching all the time and hiding in long grass if it’s available – there isn’t even a dedicated cover system for combat.There have been a lot of comparisons to The Last Of Us in the run-up to the game’s release and the location and zombies are clearly very similar. You craft traps and health potions in a near identical fashion, throw rocks to distract enemies, and attempt to make zombies and human enemies fight amongst themselves if you can. But the gameplay was never the primary draw with The Last Of Us and Days Gone benefits little from copying it.These complaints are not as serious as they might seem though and the basic action in Days Gone is perfectly enjoyable. The stealth, shooting, melee combat, and motorcycle riding are all perfectly competent – which may not sound much of complement but many open world games get one or more badly wrong and it’s actually unusual to play something that really is a jack of all trades. The only major mechanical flaw is the fiddly item wheel and the curiously unresponsive weapon swap button on the joypad.What really lets the side down though is the artificial intelligence for human enemies, which is embarrassingly poor. Everyone not only has a goldfish memory and myopic vision, but they respond to stimuli in such a robotic manner that we frequently ended up shooting (with a silencer or crossbow) multiple enemies in the same spot, making a pile of dead bodies to rival the zombie hordes. We’re still not sure if it’s a bug or not but human enemies seem oblivious to dead bodies and will often stand right on top of them without saying a word.Perhaps the inevitable day one patch will fix them, but the game is filled with low-level bugs and glitches, not just in terms of the artificial intelligence but characters floating in mid-air, broken physics, and landscapes that suddenly turn into bare hills. Although almost as annoying is the frustratingly long load times that pop up between each switch from gameplay to cut scene and back again – completely ruining the atmosphere and making you wish everyone would just shut up and get on with it.The first third of the game is a slog to get through and manages to make the game seem so bland and predictable we almost wanted to give up. But the second act revolves around a cult of crazed zombie worshippers that finally adds some momentum to the story, which leads into the third act that in turn also switches up the locations and threats. So unless you absolutely hate the game from the start we would advise persevering, even if the final chapter never lives up to its initial promise.Days Gone is a very strangely structured game in general, not least because the zombie hordes play no real role at all until right near the end. They appear in a couple of side missions before that, where you learn that they’ll chase after you in a huge swarm but give up if you go too far and snap back to their lair as if pulled by a giant rubber band. They’ll do this so quickly at times that it looks comical, as they pile back into whatever train car or cave they were hiding in.You only get the weapons needed to combat hordes halfway through the third act and there’s only a handful of story missions that involve destroying them. A peculiar process that ends up like an ultra-violent Benny Hill sketch, where Deacon insists on taking on 400 zombies on his own by setting traps and ambushes, getting the zombies to chase him, then hiding and coming back to do it again and again until they’re all gone.It’s precisely as silly as it sounds (we kept wondering why they didn’t just get a hot air balloon or something) but we liked the fact that the game gives no real instruction on how to tackle the hordes and you have to evolve your tactics with experience – most of which occurs in side missions after you’ve completed the main story.Alan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNew Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart bundle is £50 off reveals leakTop 10 new Halloween board games and tabletop RPGs 2023The use of the hordes seems a terrible waste, considering we thought that was the whole point of the game. But it seems even more wasteful given how unimaginative the missions design tends to be, with most of it being some variation of ‘go to a location and kill a small camp of humans.’Days Gone is repetitive, unimaginative, and surprisingly rough around the edges but to our own surprise we can’t pretend we didn’t get some mildly addictive pleasure from it. Much in the manner of the more middling Assassin’s Creed titles, there’s a strange sort of comfort to playing and completing such an undemanding game, with its constant stream of minor rewards – even if they’re just a tick on a list of completed missions.We wouldn’t particularly recommend Days Gone, and it’s certainly not in the same league as most of Sony’s other PlayStation 4 exclusives, but while we don’t look back at our days with it with any sense of wistfulness we don’t resent the time spent on it either.In Short: A peculiarly constructed open world zombie game that sidelines its most unique features in favour of generic action and unengaging storytelling.Pros: The zombie hordes are an impressive technical feat and learning to deal with them is interesting. Competent gameplay mechanics and plenty of content.Cons: The story and characters, and really the game as a whole, is very derivative and dry, with repetitive missions and a strange lack of zombies for a lot of the time.Score: 6/10

Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy.I have been on a journey with Days Gone. Both in terms of the hero, Deacon St. John’s, life, and the game itself - a rambling tale of zombie killing in an open world that can easily top 60 hours if you want to see everything. It’s a scrappy but satisfying adventure I’ve enjoyed despite minor bugs and a design that’s obviously been shuffled and cut during its two month delay. There’s a story that’s all over the place, while the game’s key feature - its 100+ strong monster hordes - are an impressive and terrifying spectacle, but not quite the trap-triggering set pieces originally revealed. There are obvious edits, and hot glue seams joining the bits throughout, especially in the first act. But despite that it’s still a big, engaging adventure that’s fun as a whole - enthusiastic and eager to please overall, even if the moment to moment parts don’t always connect smoothly. Release date: April 26, 2019 
Platform(s): PS4
Publisher: Sony
Developer: Sony BendFirst up those bugs. It’s a lot of little things really: nothing unplayable, more grumbling irritations like audio drop outs (silent bikes, say), weird AI moments, animation or collision glitches and framerate drops. For the most part it’s never ruined the experience for me, more chipped away at the polish. Those 60+ hours I’ve played come in part from finishing it (a good 40 odd hours if you’re not rushing) and the rest because I’ve enjoyed it. The post-end game especially. When you’ve unlocked high level skills and weapons it’s a zombie horde-massacring blast. That said, the game’s had four patches before release and I’m not entirely sure what state it’s in, or going to be. Days Gone review | Days Gone tips | Days Gone map | Days Gone IPCA Tech | Days Gone Horde locations | How to take down a Horde in Days Gone | Days Gone skins | Days Gone secret ending | Days Gone NERO Injector locations | Days Gone Ambush Camp locations | How to store weapons in Days Gone | Days Gone sound bugIssues aside Days Gone is a hearty if familiar mix of stealthing through enemy camps, combat, upgrades and crafting, mixed with occasional bouts of running the hell away from it’s zombie hordes. This post viral outbreak world is part Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, part Far Cry 5 and part The Last of Us, weaving its mechanics into an experience that is as entertaining as it is, admittedly, unoriginal. There’s a solid progression system as you complete jobs and missions to earn trust with various survivor settlements, unlocking gear, crafting recipes, skills and weapons. That’s the core journey: in-game you progress from a working-to-live drifter, to developing community ties and putting down roots that give you something to fight for. While as a player you change from an opportunistic and cautious survivor to grizzled world beating pro with smarts you’ve earned along the way.The main monsters aside from people [philosophical chin scratching...] are the Freakers - a mutated (and very alive) human, infected by a rabies-like virus. Early game even a single one is a thing to fear. You don’t have the gear or expertise to really take one on, and just two or three getting your scent is probably game over. As a result, you’ll be creeping cautiously around forests hoping for stealth kills at the start, terrified of every leafy noise in the distance. Later, though, you’ll be tooled up and taking on groups of them, gathered in hundred strong hordes with barely a thought, having learned how they work and how to win. It’s the kind of gradual, satisfying growth that evolves without being obvious until you look back and see how far you’ve come.Even when you’re high level and packing the best gear, hordes are always daunting and terrifying in equal measure. Seeing them scream, as hundreds of clawing, frenzied monsters flow over cars or around buildings like a bucket of grasping hands splashed into the world never gets old. However, they are just sort of scattered around the open map - in caves dotted around the map, or picking at mass graves - with almost no explanation or intent. A few places have a scattering of explosive barrels and trucks to help thin them out, but otherwise it’s generally a case of placing bombs, throwing molotovs and then back peddling and hoping for the best. It’s a far cry from the carefully orchestrated trap-filled, set pieces originally revealed. Only one place - the red barn sawmill of the original 2016 E3 demo - features any of the barriers, doors and traps you can trigger to stem the flow of creatures. Although those are never mentioned or explained, and I set most of them off accidentally wondering why there were prompts hanging in the air. Deacon only even discusses the barest concepts of horde tactics right at the end of the game. By which point I’d learned all I needed to know wondered why I was basically getting a tutorial chat on horde management some 50 hours in. That sense of things maybe not being in quite the right place also applies to the story. The opening has a strange start with no clear or overriding objective for the first few hours. Instead there’s just a collection of ‘Storylines’ that have you completing jobs for survivor camps. The Storyline system crosses and blends progression so that completing one goal can advance multiple questlines, while some things can stop for no clear reason until you finish doing another job not obviously connected. It is confusing. The very first mission, ‘Chasing Leon’ hangs at 50% for ages even when you have the required item and can wave it frantically in the face of the person who wants it, possible while yelling ‘I have iiiiiit. It’s right here’. To actually complete it you have to finish another mission on the other side of the map, that then unlocks an option to resolve it by making a choice with no clear payoff (despite the claim of making a significant decision). Elsewhere, an event that ultimately drives the first act to completion somehow manages to take barely days but also several weeks at the same time depending on whether you’re measuring by its internal plot time, or by the other required missions that happen in-between. It’s a beginning that feels reconstructed rather than intended, with steps artificially extended by breaks or oddly tiny increments (a couple of mission beats involve little more than a lengthy journey across the map for a single sentence of dialogue). Persist, however, and things coalesce: a new area of the map opens up (and, much later, another area again) and clearer purpose develops. It almost feels like a TV series that doesn’t find its direction until the second season - as you move to new places narrative strands get weighter, better tied together and something more approaching a plot develops. The mid to late game has some likeable, interesting characters and antagonists, and sows enough seeds for some emotional investment to pay off. Although I’d argue it never really settles on an actual ‘main’ goal until almost the final few hours. It also pulls an almost cartoonish and childish fake out with the only high stakes plot choice it makes in the finale. I’m still weirdly angry about it because something that felt irreversible, and meaningful as a result, turns almost into an ‘it was all a dream’ level of joke.  Through all this Deacon is a conflicting character. He’s likeable and funny for the most part as he interacts, quips and wisecracks with the supporting cast. When it works Sam Witwer’s performance has an easy going charm up there with Nolan North or Troy Baker. But the character is also prone to bouts of callous and unrepentant hatred, murderous aggression or outright brutality that can grate against the lighter moments. Largely because the nebulous story structure can see situations switch on a dime, stripping key moments of the momentum needed to back them up, as the emotional makeup of the man changes as if by button press to suit the story. Sometimes it feels like you literally sat on the remote and changed channels accidentally. It’s also worth mentioning that if people struggle accepting Nathan Drake’s actually killed hundreds people, they are going to lose their shit when Deac‘ commits literal war crimes and borderline terrorism. Twice. There’s another ‘main’ character to consider and that’s the bike, Deacon’s transport through all this. After so many video game horses dutifully following, or coming when called, it takes a little getting used to remembering where you parked, or needing fuel just to move (you also can’t save or fast travel unless you’re near your bike). It’s different, but the motorbike is every bit a tool for you to use, which also grows with you. You upgrade it, decorate it, learn how best to use it and, at this stage, I’m very attached to ‘my’ bike: cherry red, armored grills, flame decals on the gas tank. It helps that Days Gone is a beautiful place to ride through too, with an atmospheric world to take on that rolls on for miles. It’s perfect for long rides - the varied mountains of Oregon evocative in the rain, serene in the snow and exciting as thunder rolls across the sky. Days Gone’s world is very much greater than the sum of it parts. It’s haphazard nature wouldn’t have survived on a smaller scale, but this is a substantial thing. The story can be spotty, and the gameplay glitchy, but over tens of hours it evens out. It’s easier to forgive a scattered narrative and occasional Freaker standing ankle deep in asphalt when you can spend hours exploring, discovering, or fighting through what it has to offer. It’s open world has enough surprises and depths to penetrate that I always found it enjoyable and full of memorable stories. Like the first time I ran out of fuel (rookie mistake) and crept through the forest at night looking for gas, terrified of every howl and shuffle in the trees. Or the time I discovered a horde by turning my torch on in a cave and finding 50 pale faces staring back at me. Those are the moments that stick with me, despite everything else. This may not hit the heights of recent Sony efforts like God of War or Spider-Man, but it suffers more from that expectation than it does its own rough edges. I'm GamesRadar's Senior Guides Co-ordinator, which means I run GamesRadar's guides and tips content.

Game Informer,"The pause menu of Days Gone keeps track of the time since Deacon St. John was separated from his wife, Sarah, who was helicoptered away during the chaotic zombie outbreak. Since that day, he’s been living a life similar to his old one as a biker, eschewing mandated responsibilities and trusting his own code above all else.However, no man is an island, and as the remaining human settlements fortify themselves against the zombie hordes and each other, Deacon is more tethered than he first thought. He might not totally buy into the anti-government paranoia, militaristic, nihilistic, or rigid philosophies of those around him, but he’s not entirely selfish, either. Like Deacon, Days Gone sets off on its own path, landing between being a dynamic open world and a linear, physically constrained story. While its gameplay systems create fun and harrowing scenarios, the way Days Gone straddles the line between two extremes leaves me wanting more from both the story and open world.Resources are scarce in the ruined landscape, affecting almost everything you do. You have to maintain repairs on your bike, you can craft lots of equipment, and your melee weapons break frequently. The situation isn’t all grim, however. Days Gone does a good job making you feel desperate but not frustrated, leading to improvisation like making the most of your equipment. If I ran out of ammo for my favorite weapon, I might use a sound emitter  to attract zombies to enemies’ location. What about the subsequent zombie rush that inevitably follows? That’s a problem for another time. Hopefully  I have some ammo by then, or maybe I switch to stealth or my crafted melee weapon – a baseball bat modded with a saw blade.Dealing with hordes – massive gatherings of zombies – is its own tense, terrifying challenge that requires you use more of your environment to survive since you can’t simply shoot your way clear of the throng before they tear you apart. You have to use their rage against them, funneling them into choke points where you can set explosives or shoot flammables to take out chunks of them before running away and regrouping. The unpredictable horde A.I. adds intrigue in successive tries since you can’t always predict where they’re going to go. You can buy better equipment and some supplies through human camp settlements, but only by earning their trust first by doing missions for them. These tasks, like clearing out a camp of Marauders or PCP-addled human Rippers aren’t novel, but Deacon’s dealing with the camps and their leadership help define him by juxtaposing him with each camp’s views on survival, such as Copeland’s anti-government conspiracy mindset. These camps also figure into your open-world activities; when you save survivors in the wild, you earn a big trust boost with the camp you send them to. Rescuing survivors, hunting, and collecting random plants suggests an open-world structure ripe with possibilities, but Days Gone’s landscape is more dull than it appears. The map has a lot of land on it, but it’s not filled with intriguing side stories, characters, and situations. Instead, it contains prescribed missions and anonymous people to kill – and these tasks were not tempting or rewarding enough to draw me away from the main story.Days Gone’s narrative is standard and sufficient, but it trips up when it leans on minor characters at multiple points for important and/or dramatic turns in the plot. This strains credulity, makes the world feel too small, and pads out the experience with filler missions using otherwise boring stealth gameplay mechanics. My least favorite was being asked to search for a guy’s MP3 player as the story was all coming to a head.On the technical front it’s also worth mentioning that Days Gone lacks polish for a first-party title. The framerate can vary, and the loads are surprisingly long and frequent on the standard PS4 – something that shouldn’t be necessary at this stage.Days Gone has good gameplay foundations. The scarcity of supplies and ever-present threat of zombies put me on edge as much as it gave me options to escape by the skin of my teeth. But the inability to fully deliver on either the story or open world fronts makes it a title of both possibilities and limitations.

Polygon,"Filed under:Hordes of enemies aren’t enough to save this gameWhat zombie stories are left to tell in 2019? While Days Gone reveals its “Freakers” are actually infected, mutated humans instead of the undead, their mindless shuffling and groaning could have fooled me. Turns out the world after a definitely not-zombie apocalypse still gives me deja vu with the familiar themes of “why survive if you can barely live” and “mankind is the true monster we have to fear.” Stop me if you’ve heard this one, but maybe we’re the walking dead? Think about it. While Days Gone horde mechanics show a pulse, the rest of the game feels lifeless. Its massive, but repetitive scope renders even those aspects I initially found entertaining a chore.Everything’s already halfway to hell in the game’s opening cutscenes. Screams echo through a small Oregon town. I see people running frantically away from the feral, herd-like masses of Freakers. Emergency response personnel in hazmat suits yell about an evacuation. Amid the scramble to escape is Deacon St. John, a veteran and local biker gang member whose scruffy appearance and hardened-yet-winsome persona reminds me of at least half a dozen other video game protagonists. After securing his wife a seat on a helicopter headed out, he travels with his fellow gang member and friend Boozer to a nearby refugee camp. All they find is a Freaker infestation and a crashed helicopter; his wife is presumed dead. A cutscene sets a precedent for the rest of the game, focusing on the after effects of the apocalypse only as they relate to a chunk of rural Oregon. A lack of exposition leaves the fate of the rest of the world, the country, and even the remaining states in the Pacific Northwest a big, unanswered question mark. Deacon and Boozer find work as “Drifters” two years after the incident, doing mercenary work and odd jobs for the surviving communities. This is no small feat, as the area has been overtaken by self-mutilating raider cults and the Freakers themselves, rumored to be transformed by some sort of infection. Oddly enough, no one seems too worried about catching the virus it if they’ve already survived. No one I meet is in a rush to destroy the masses of Freakers that roam the state, and it takes around 24 hours of playtime before a character exhibits curiosity about what caused the outbreak in the first place. Everyone seems pretty willing to accept things as they are. Instead of getting to the bottom of these questions, most communities prefer to send me crisscrossing the gorgeous Oregon countryside and rolling mountains of Days Gone’s open world on my motorcycle as I hunt down bounties, recruit survivors, and raze entire camps of raiders. Completing missions builds trust within these communities, which in turn unlocks better gear, a reward I find much more compelling than the idea of helping each camp’s one-note characters. Most of these quests repeat a couple formulas, particularly in the game’s first half: Days Gone never settles into a satisfying rhythm. Every so often a lengthy cutscene will unload exposition into my lap as I struggle to retain this surge of context and backstory. Some essential characters and antagonists don’t show up at all until dozens of hours into the game. As a result, Days Gone sometimes seems remarkably sparse, while other times I find it almost intolerably bloated. Deep into the game, a drawn-out standoff looks and feels like the game’s finale, and I audibly groan in despair when my reward for the hours of battle preparation is a whole new area that unlocks the last third of the journey.I am able to find some fun in the game’s flexibility when it comes to tackling the hordes of Freakers. Staking out marauder outposts from nearby high ledges and planning my attack, sniping enemies from afar or breaking out my shotgun after I’m spotted to end the fight in a bloody mess, brings a certain amount of satisfaction. I particularly appreciate the unique and often elaborate traps that other communities set for me and people like me, some of which manage to tell interesting stories about their creators. Following the path to one camp’s main entrance leads me to a cave packed with Freakers who were placed there as makeshift guard dogs, while another sniper-heavy tree fort is perched dangerously close to a horde, so anything but a stealthy approach puts both sides at risk of getting mauled.Developer SIE Bend Studio is able to provide a sense of tension by making sure ammo is scarce and limiting the amount I can carry. Melee weapons and silencers for my guns degrade with time, forcing me to be acutely aware of every silent bullet fired and ax swung. I can craft weapons like Molotov cocktails, flashbangs, and mines, but I have to establish trust with the local camps before I can gain more supplies to create them. I carefully horde my supplies until I absolutely need to use them, and even then I’m aware of how vulnerable I might be during the next battle. Even traveling between waypoints like Freaker nests or survivor camps is a risk. The scattered fuel pumps and gas cans I find along the way may hold infinite supplies, but my motorcycle’s gas tank can only hold so much fuel at a time. Running out means I’m forced to walk to the nearest settlement, which is a scary prospect given how many people and things there are out there that want me dead. Days Gone may take place across a huge swath of Oregon, but my curiosity about what I can find dies a quick death in the first act. Nearly every hidden cave or decaying building I explore proves to be a location for a quest I’ll later unlock, but until then, they remain depressingly empty. My rewards for being adventurous often boil down to some extra ammo or a landmark that unlocks a dry fact about the state.It’s a shame the game never quite makes the most of it’s definitely-not-zombies: the shambling hordes of Freakers fill the screen with writhing, frightening faces and limbs. The first encounter stops me cold, the game’s gnarly sounds and sharp score doing a fantastic job of building anxiety. I often hear the musical cues for the mobs before I spot them, my movement noise accidentally alerting them. I look for the Freakers, spotting the waves of monsters as they turn my way. It’s genuinely frightening. Well, it is until I begin to empty my weapons. Taking out the hordes becomes even more enjoyable once I build up enough community trust to unlock the game’s heavier weaponry, and it’s at this point that Days Gone begins to feel like a strange but not unwelcome mixture of stealth and tower defense. I need to craft plenty of traps, like mines and remote bombs, to place near the Freakers if I hope to survive these battles. Then I must find a way to attract them into my killzone, and perch nearby with as many guns and as much ammo as I can carry to finish off the surviving Freakers. Those moments of fun and challenge are too fleeting however, and they’re surrounded by a confusing story and long hours of repetitive tasks. Like a zombie, it lurches through the motions, hungry for brains, lacking its own.A weekly roundup of the best things from PolygonPlease check your email to find a confirmation email, and follow the steps to confirm your humanity.Oops.

   on May 20, 2021 at 11:14AM PDTEditor's Note: In May 2021, Sony ported Days Gone to PC. In addition to compiling two years' worth of updates since the 2019 game's initial launch, the Windows version offers opportunities for enhanced graphics and performance with more powerful gaming PCs. Mike Epstein delivers his impressions on the game's technical improvements and how they may change your experience playing the PC version of Days Gone. GameSpot's original review for Days Gone, first published in April 2019, is below in full and the assessment for the PC version is integrated at the end. This review contains minor spoilers about mission structure and overall story direction. There are no spoilers for major narrative moments.Around 10 hours into Days Gone, you're thrown into a hunting tutorial apropos of nothing. The over-the-top libertarian character takes you out with a rifle and shows you how to track a deer, although you've already had a tracking tutorial. You're then tasked with getting more meat for you and your buddy because your supply is running low, something you never have to do again. You also don't cook or eat; you can only donate meat to camps around the map to earn a negligible amount of trust and money with them. After a little while, even stopping to get meat off wolves that attacked you doesn't seem worth it.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Days Gone Quick Review VideoLike many things in Days Gone, hunting exists just to be there, an idea that is picked up and then abandoned at random. Unlike hunting, some of those ideas are even good in the moment. But most aspects of Days Gone lack purpose. Its many narrative threads flirt with being meaningful and interesting but never quite commit, with characters whose actions and motivations don't make sense. Riding a souped-up motorcycle through the world and taking out zombie nests and hordes is satisfying in the way that completing open-world checklists often is, but by the end, you're left to wonder what the point of it all was.The first act of the game--about 20 hours or so--sets up quite a few narrative arcs. Two years after the initial ""Freaker"" outbreak, biker buddies Deacon St. John and Boozer have become drifters doing odd jobs for nearby survivor camps and keeping mostly to themselves. Deacon's wife, Sarah, had been stabbed at the very beginning of the outbreak; Deacon put her on a government helicopter bound for a refugee camp so she could get medical attention, but when he and Boozer arrived, the camp has been overrun by Freaks, and Sarah had apparently died. Deacon is understandably not coping with it well. Boozer suggests riding north and leaving the memories behind, but Deacon's bike breaks down and is subsequently looted for parts, so one of your main goals is to earn trust and credits at the nearby camps in order to rebuild your motorcycle.The motorcycle is central to everything you do in Days Gone. Getting anywhere, including by fast travel, requires your bike, and if you want to save while out in the world, you better be right next to it. Getting off your bike is a matter of both your entrance and your exit; you need to stop far enough away from enemies so they don't hear you coming, but you also need to be able to run to your bike quickly if things go south and you need to escape. And, as you're sneaking past Freakers to loot things like bandages and ammo, you also need to be on the lookout for a gas can and some scrap metal to keep your bike in top shape--if it breaks down or runs out of gas, you're basically screwed. That said, gas and other loot do regenerate if you leave and return to a location, so you'll never truly run out of anything so long as you put in the time to look for it.At the beginning, you do jobs for two camps: Copeland's conspiracy theorist stronghold and Tucker's hellish forced-labor camp. Copeland's has a mechanic capable of upgrading your bike, while Tucker's has a well-stocked weapons merchant. Your starter junk bike gets about a mile per gallon, and you can't store a gas can on your bike or your person, so you either have to return to a camp to fuel up or constantly scrounge for gas cans out in Freaker territory. This makes wandering around and doing things in the open world frustrating at first, so you do a lot of throwaway missions for the two camps to start.Many of these early missions consist of cookie-cutter bounty-hunting and rescue jobs in which you go to a place, track a person using your apparently psychic Survival Vision to highlight footprints and other clues, and then kill some bandits or Freakers. Some of these require you to take the target alive, which often means chasing them on your bike and shooting at their tires with your pistol. If you happen to run out of gas or ammo, or if your bike is already weak and breaks down after a couple of bumpy turns, you auto-fail these missions and have to start over. You also accelerate with R2 and shoot with R1, which, while not horrible, is clunky and awkward.One early scene involving a drug thief kicks off a series of missions like these that, once completed, has no bearing on the rest of the game despite initial appearances; once you track down the stolen drugs you have to choose which camp to return them to, but there are no consequences either way, and then the situation is dropped entirely. The only result is getting some trust and credits with one of the camps--I chose Copeland simply because I wanted money for a better fuel tank. A lot of the story missions going forward, as you discover a third, more narratively relevant camp, follow the same structures as these earlier missions. But the focus on Tucker and Copeland specifically amounts to hours of nothing in the grand scheme of the story. Tucker's forced labor doesn't come back to bite anyone, and while Tucker and Copeland don't seem to like each other, doing work for one camp doesn't affect your relationship with the other. Once you get to the third camp, Lost Lake, Tucker and Copeland cease to matter at all, not least because Lost Lake has both a better mechanic and better weapons.Once you upgrade your bike a bit, though, the world opens up. No longer bound by low gas mileage and a weak arsenal, you can head further out and more handily take on enemy-controlled areas around the map. You clear ambush camps by killing everyone present and eliminate Freaker infestation zones by burning all their nests. In addition to trust and credits, clearing an ambush camp nets you resources to loot, a map of the area, and a new fast travel point; destroying an infestation zone allows you to fast travel in the area. Unlocking the map and neutralizing threats is satisfying in the way that cleaning up clutter bit by bit is, and you can see your work pay off in your bike's upgrades. However, there's little variety between each ambush camp and infestation zone, and they get repetitive early--especially because Deacon dry-heaves and whines about the nests smelling horrible at each one.The real motivation to do all of this is twofold. Early on in the game, Deacon's best friend Boozer is attacked by a group of Rippers, a doomsday cult with a number of bizarre rituals. The Rippers singe a tattoo off Boozer's arm and leave him with third-degree burns, so Deacon's purpose in life is to keep Boozer alive and healthy. This mostly involves finding sterile bandages and the one mission where you gather meat for him. On top of that, though, Deacon sees a helicopter belonging to the government agency NERO, which had been involved in the initial relief effort, flying overhead. That gives Deacon a bit of hope that Sarah might still be alive, since he'd put her on a NERO helicopter after she was stabbed, so you start stalking the NERO soldiers and scientists to investigate further.There are a number of flashbacks to Deacon's relationship with Sarah before the outbreak, bolstered by his hope that she's alive. They're largely awkward cutscenes interspersed with short sections of walking slowly while Sarah and Deacon talk about surface-level topics, and they don't ever provide a convincing reason why they're together. Deacon is a biker and Sarah is a ""nice girl"" scientist, which is fine, but ""opposites attract"" isn't enough to make their relationship compelling. It's romantic in that Deacon hasn't given up on Sarah, but the main takeaway from the flashbacks is that they're physically attracted to each other and that Deacon doesn't talk about his feelings.The NERO arc is where things really pick up. Spying on the NERO scientists consists of insta-fail stealth missions. They can be frustrating before you unlock abilities to improve your stealth skills, but the conversations you overhear are legitimately interesting and answer questions that other zombie fiction often neglects. For example, you learn from one eavesdropping on a scientist studying Freaker scat that they eat more than just other people and each other--they also eat plants, and that means they're not going to starve any time soon (like in 28 Days Later). Deacon quickly gets in contact with a NERO researcher who uses government resources to track down what might have happened to Sarah. Even though their relationship is confusing, it is a tempting mystery.Abandoned Nero medical units and research sites contain more small details, including recorders that play snippets of scenes--a scientist studying a Freaker specimen, the moment a camp got overrun, or just banter between soldiers. Getting inside a unit is a matter of refueling the generator, making sure to find and disable every speaker nearby so the noise doesn't attract Freakers. Finding each speaker can be a bit tricky at certain sites, which makes the moment you turn the power on more exciting and the realization that you're in the clear more of a relief. And in addition to satisfying your curiosity, you're also given the more tangible reward of an injector that improves your health, stamina, and bullet-time-like focus ability.As you learn more about NERO and the Freakers, you're introduced to new, more powerful types of Freaks, including a berserker and an all-female variant that screams to attract more Freaks your way. They don't really provide new challenges so much as slow you down, and they feel like a stopgap measure to tide you over until the first horde-based mission around 40 hours into the game. That first horde mission is exhilarating--running around while using tight spaces and molotovs to keep the horde off you, eventually taking out hundreds of Freakers, is a well-earned victory. But that mission is followed very quickly by another one, and after a short break, you have two more nearly back-to-back horde missions that lead up to the end of the main story. Without any breathing room, the hordes are exhausting to deal with, and you'll likely have to stop everything to loot and rebuild your stockpile of resources after each one just so you can progress.Ultimately, though, Days Gone isn't about NERO or Sarah or the Freakers. It's about Deacon, and what he wants is what matters. Narrative threads are dropped as soon as Deacon no longer has a use for them. Copeland and Tucker only matter until Deacon gets to a camp that has better supplies. Boozer's health is only important because it's Deacon's reason for living. Even the fascinating little details about the Freakers are useless to Deacon, who only cares about Sarah--but not what Sarah wants or needs, just that his ""ol' lady"" might be alive somewhere. Every character is seen through this Deacon-focused lens, and as a result, they're two-dimensional.Deacon is selfish, and it's simply boring that the game is uncritical of him.Deacon does not learn anything over the course of the game, and the story is concerned with validating his actions and feelings above all else. When one character urges him not to kill anyone in cold blood, Deacon ""proves"" that murder is better than mercy. As Boozer nearly breaks through to Deacon about learning to let go, Deacon learns something new about NERO and clings to his hope even harder. Deacon also has a policy where he doesn't kill unarmed women, which does not affect the story in any way and goes completely unexamined. There's no introspection here; Deacon is selfish, and it's simply boring that the game is uncritical of him.I did a lot of things in Days Gone. I burned every single Freaker nest; I cleared every ambush camp; I maxed out my bike; I took out a few optional hordes just because. Like Deacon with Sarah, I kept going because I hoped to find something, to follow a thread to a possibly fascinating or satisfying or impactful conclusion. But at the end of it all, I'd only gotten scraps.On PC, Days Gone puts its best foot--or motorcycle wheel--forward. Untethered to the limitations of last-gen hardware, the two-year-old PS4 game now offers the wider gamut of visual and performance customization options common among PC games. Running the game on High or Very High settings, the forests and broken roads of the post-apocalyptic Pacific Northwest look sharper and more detailed on PS4. The same goes for characters: The detailing of Deacon St. John's jacket and patch-covered cut is clear, even when you aren't in a cutscene staring at it.As with most refreshed ports in the last six months or so, the biggest improvement is to frame rate. Days Gone allows you to play with an uncapped frame rate, and seems capable of delivering very high performance. With what I'd describe as an upper-middle-tier gaming GPU featuring a recent Core i7 processor and Nvidia 1070 GPU, I got a stable 95fps out of the game running at 1080p and just under 60fps running at 1440p.That doesn't mean it isn't launching without any bumps in the road. Though the game runs quite smoothly--far better than the game ran on PS4 at launch--I did experience some minor technical issues here and there: In one session I couldn't navigate the weapon selection and crafting wheel until I switched controllers. I also lost about 15 minutes of save progress after a save bounced me back to an earlier checkpoint. Like Sony's PC port of Horizon Zero Dawn, which launched with some glaring bugs, I expect some of these issues will be ironed out in the coming weeks.While there's no new content specifically for PC, developer Bend Studios has added some improvements to the game since launch, including a New Game+, a more difficult survival mode, and some cosmetics. I wouldn't say any of these features dramatically improves the experience, but they do allow you to get more out of it, if you're so inclined.As the original review notes, Days Gone is a superficial experience. Despite telling a long, winding story, it is ultimately a game about Deacon riding his bike around Freaker-infested forests and clearing objectives. You could argue, then, that the PC version of Days Gone plays to the game's strengths: It enhances the most superficial aspects of the game, how it looks and runs. - Mike Epstein, May 2021 Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"
USgamer,"There’s a point about a quarter way into Days Gone where our hero, Deacon St. John, finds looters wrecking the church where he married his missing wife. Deacon is a drifter who makes a living hunting bounties across the Pacific Northwest, monetising the post-apocalypse. He never hesitates to use his gun, though he doesn’t shoot women unless he has to - it’s his code. He’s like a sexist, murderous Batman who wears a backwards cap and a biker gang cut. Twatman.In my playthrough, I clear the holy site with an LMG and grenades, then Deacon does the only logical thing: firebombs the church so nobody can vandalise it ever again.Days Gone is very dumb. 
 
This is a world where many of the characters inexplicably don’t know what antibiotics and lavender are. “Those anti-whatever-they’re-called,” multiple characters say. “There’s this rare plant called lavender,” says another.It’s a world where the anatomy of the big, brutish not-zombies (they’re called freakers and they’re functionally identical to zombies, but they shit themselves) is explained in an audio recording. Apparently this particular breed of freakers were steroid abusers before being infected. Deepest lore.There are two things that set Days Gone apart from other open world games: the fact that a motorbike is your main form of transportation, and there are sometimes thousands of zombies on-screen. The bike is genuinely refreshing - deserts, mountains, and mud-tracked forests take advantage of your maneuverability, and you feel every bump and slide. The hordes are visually impressive, stressful and exciting to deal with, but woefully underused.The plot’s driving force for the first third of the game has you waiting for your best friend to recover from an injury so you can ride north. While you wait for your buddy, Boozer (I swear I’m not making these names up), you ride between encampments and do odd jobs, all while trying to find out what happened to your wife.You’re told Deacon’s backstory via flashbacks of the world before a virus turned everyone into incontinent zombies. You also see how Deacon and his wife were separated in a sequence that feels like a straight-to-DVD rip-off of The Last of Us’s prologue. 
 
To earn these flashbacks, you either drive to a grave site and listen to Deacon monologue about accountants and other mundane stuff, or you tackle one of many instant-fail stealth missions. These quests have you infiltrating government agency landing zones and eavesdropping on scientists. They’re easy enough, but they’re repeated far too often and your only punishment for failure is having to listen to the same dialogue again and again.Listening to the same dialogue on repeat is Days Gone’s kink. It constantly replays conversations for no reason at all. As you explore the open world, radio transmissions come through from characters you’ve met, and there’s so many of them that the game seems to get confused about which ones it’s already played.Those radio conversations, as well as the chats Deacon has with passengers on the back of his bike, clearly weren’t performance captured. The acting in cutscenes is great, with emotions often subtly portrayed with a glance or a slight grimace, but Deacon is in a world of his own when riding his bike. There’s a truther radio station that broadcasts throughout the entire game. Every time the transmission ends, Deacon screams back at the host (who obviously can’t hear him) in one of the most jarring instances of overacting I’ve ever seen.There are other instances where the sound is completely borked. Sometimes, your motorbike’s engine doesn’t make any sound at all, or a distant freaker will scream as if it’s right next to you. Sometimes your guns stop making any noise. Occasionally Deacon shouts over his bike engine when you’re on foot, making him appear deranged. 
 
I’ve had instances where the world fails to load in and I’ve fallen through the map to my death. I’ve been running away from a horde of freakers and accidentally clipped through a truck before its textures and collision loaded in. I had a boss fight with a mutated bear where it just stood there and allowed me to throw molotovs at it until it died. I’ve ran through a tunnel to clear an enemy base, only for all the enemies to spawn in behind me. It’s an extremely pretty game - particularly during sunset and snowfall - but it’s a technical mess.This is before even getting into how prescriptive it is. “This world comes for you” is the game’s tagline, a marker of the developer’s intent. Sony Bend wanted to create a game where the world is threatening and unexpected things can happen as you explore, creating personal stories. In reality, it's a handful of things that can happen in the world endlessly repeating. In missions, it wants you to play a very specific way, too. Go slightly off course and a warning flashes up that you’re leaving the mission area. Keep going and you’re back to a checkpoint.In one mission, I’m driving a girl across the map to a nearby camp. We come to a tunnel and it quickly becomes apparent that this is a trap. I’m expected to get off my bike, kill all the enemies, then go back to my bike and ride through. Fuck that. I just ride through with the kid still on my back seat. As soon as I exit the tunnel, both of us fully intact, I get a mission failed screen for leaving the kid behind - the kid that’s on my back seat.One of the ways the game attempts to create drama in the open world is by making fuel a resource. If you run out of fuel while exploring, you have no choice but to slowly walk your bike to find some. Fast travel becomes locked out. If you’re nowhere near a petrol station or jerry can, fuck you - all you can do is beg for a hill so you can careen for a while. It might make sense on paper, but even Mad Max - a game set in a world where petroleum is gold - provides a crutch for when fuel stores run dry. It’s the kind of thing you thought would be cool in GTA when you were 13, but is actually extremely shit. 
 
Running out of juice isn’t even the only way you can decommission your bike, either. If you get ambushed by survivors - sometimes with wire pulled across the road, sometimes by a sniper - your bike gets wrecked. If you’ve used all your scrap and you’re nowhere near any abandoned cars, you’re in for another slow walk until you find something. Once you’re used to filling up your fuel and collecting scrap at every opportunity, you can negate this all through careful play, but then topping up fuel and scrap becomes a needless layer of busywork instead.Days Gone is a huge, generous game, even if you just mainline the story, but it does everything in its power to pad itself out. Even fast travel is locked behind monotonous repetition. If there are any infected nests between you and a fast travel point, you can’t fast travel - you have to clear out the nests first, which plays out exactly the same every single time.It’s frustrating because the game does pick up in the second half. There are glimmers of Red Dead Redemption in some moments - it’s clear there’s some inspiration here - but it constantly lets itself down with bewildering decisions that pull you out of the fantasy, rather than reinforcing it.The lack of seamless transitions between gameplay and cutscenes means you’re often staring at a black screen as the game interrupts you, the story is predictable, your activities are repetitive, and the technical issues - frame rate drops, freezes, and myriad bugs - are a constant annoyance. While it’s still slightly better than most recent Xbox One exclusives, Days Gone just isn’t anywhere near the quality of the majority of PS4 first-party releases.

Days Gone is the latest game to take place in a post-apocalyptic world filled with zombie-like creatures. The zombie game is an odd sub-genre that has trouble striking a balance. We’ve had amazing games like Left 4 Dead and the Resident Evil series (some of them at least), while others, like the recent Overkill’s The Walking Dead, were lackluster at best. Days Gone is one of the more ambitious zombie projects we’ve seen in video gaming, but in a genre that feels somewhat fatigued does it set itself above the pack?Days Gone puts you in the boots of Deacon St. John as he tries to survive a slice of rural Oregon that has been transformed by a civilization-ending bout of zombieitis. The game picks up around two years after the disease rendered most of the population into the cannibalistic monstrosities everyone calls Freakers, and he’s rough for the wear. He and his best friend Boozer are all that remains of the Mongrels motorcycle club, and still continue to fly the colors of the MC even after every biker game in the world is long dead.Deek and Boozer refuse to settle down into the safety of a survivor camp and instead spend their days as mercenaries. When the game begins, the two aren’t thinking much further than where to find the next meal and a full tank of gas. Deek harbors resentment at himself for putting his wounded wife, Sarah, on a helicopter during the outbreak and sending her to her apparent death. His self-hatred runs so deep that he’s continually drawn to put himself into dangerous and deadly situations. Boozer’s motivations are mainly to keep his friend from teetering off the edge of sanity.Unfortunately, a run in with the Rippers, a homicidal cult who wishes to “get low” and worship the Freakers, ends with Boozer being almost mortally wounded. With his buddy out of commission, Deek finds himself falling into the depths of depression.Days Gone has a complex story, but at its heart, it’s about redemption and acceptance, specifically Deek’s. After two years those who survive are just starting to accept that the world isn’t going to change back to the way it was. Much of the plot involves the way Deek and the people he meets deal with that realization.Like most open world games, there’s a lot of subplots and intrigue going on in Days Gone besides the main story. Pockets of survivors have banded together. Some try to rebuild a semblance of society by banding together into survivor camps. Others become marauders, preying on the small remainder of humanity that haven’t succumbed to the Freaker virus. It’s here that the game has some pacing issues. Deek and Boozer’s stories are fascinating to behold, as are some of the other characters you meet.However, Days Gone suffers from the drawback, so many open world titles do of having repetitive missions with NPCs that just don’t matter. Played linearly, Days Gone is a bit long-winded, but keeps you pretty engaged until the end. When you factor in side missions, though, the game starts getting a bit tedious. You’ll find yourself doing a lot of going to point A and killing target B throughout your adventure. During the main story missions, it’s not so bad because there’s a lot of context, but the bounty side missions just basically have you chasing down a rando because the quest giver says they did a bad thing.By far the worst part of the game are the flashbacks to Deek’s life before the outbreak. These are things that occurred during peaceful times, so you’re not allowed to run around or anything like that. Instead, when you do get to walk it’s at a snail’s pace. Most of the time, though, you’re stuck just controlling the camera as Deek and Sarah talk. I really wish these segments were abridged or just cutscenes. When you’re riding the high of jumping hills on a motorcycle or taking down a camp of bandits, nothing brings you down like another flashback where Deek shuffles down a dirt path, and you listen to small talk for five minutes before the game gets around to whatever point it’s trying to make.The main plot is worth sticking around for, in any case. Days Gone has a slow beginning, but around the midpoint, things start picking up, and it really comes together in the last quarter of the game. Some of the plot twists are obvious, but then you’ll find that there’s a twist to the twist and it keeps you glued to your controller to see more.One thing that got cut from Days Gone that could have given the game a bit more punch is the choice system. Initially, you would have had the opportunity to make decisions that would have affected people’s reactions to Deek. One that was shown in footage around a year ago involved the guy you’re chasing at the start of the game. He’s killed some people and stolen some drugs from a camp, and you’re running him down on their behalf. Originally, when you finally tracked him down, you would get the choice to either leave him for the Freakers to eat or do the merciful thing and shoot him.In the final game, you don’t get a choice. Deek shoots him, and you keep it moving. The absence of choice really is apparent in the first third or so of the game. There are several instances when the game definitely set you up for a choice, but the scene just awkwardly continues. The most jarring one I experienced was when I took out a marauder camp. As I was going to climb a ladder, a cutscene played, and a woman snuck up on Deek and tried to get him to surrender by pointing a gun at him.The pacing and acting of the scene made it evident that you would have gotten a choice here to kill her or let her go. In the final game, Deek lets her go with no input from the player. The developers did the right thing and announced that choices were removed from the game. Given how long just the main plot in Days Gone is, I can understand why they made that choice. It would have been a mammoth undertaking to make two separate paths through the game somehow.However, the removal of choice in Days Gone pretty much eliminates player agency. Whether that’s a good thing or a bad thing is up in the air. After finishing the game, I would like to have had the choice to play Deek as a bit more hardened. He puts on an air of being a badass biker dude, but he’s always playing the hero and doing the right thing to a point that’s somewhat unrealistic given his circumstances. Having the choice to roleplay a little with the decisions would have made me feel a bit more connected to the character. As it is I felt like an observer throughout the whole (admittedly enjoyable) story more than a participant.The Freakers as a whole embody the 28 Days Later-type of zombie more than a classic lurching Romero undead. The most basic Freaker, the Swarmer, is fast, powerful, and travels in packs. They are mostly mindless, but their biting and scratching are strong enough to remain a threat throughout the game. Alone they can be distracted and killed or avoided pretty easily, but especially when dealing with hordes, you’ve got to be extremely careful.Days Gone actually does something I’ve never seen a zombie game do before. There are adolescent Freakers called Newts that make their nests in abandoned buildings. I’m not all about shooting kids, but I really liked that the game actually faced the question of what happened to them instead of just making them disappear. These Freakers rarely attack unless you get too close or your health is very low, so you don’t often have to engage them unless you choose to.There are some rarer, specialized Freakers as well. There’s the Screamer, who is basically the Witch from Left4Dead. You’ll also run into Breakers, who are gigantic and muscle-bound Freakers. Even animals aren’t immune to the virus. Runners are wolves who have turned and have gained the ability to outrun a motorcycle at full speed. You’ll also have to face down the occasional Rager, a bear who not only is infected but also somehow has barbed wire wrapped around it.While the Freakers aren’t incredibly varied and innovative, they interact with the world in some unique ways. For one, all the various enemy types will fight one another. If Swarmers spot a Rager or a Breaker, a fight will break out just as if they saw you. This can be used to your advantage, as you can lure nearby enemies to do your dirty work for you. If you’re facing down a marauder camp, for example, you can use attractors to bring nearby Freakers into the camp and then deal with whichever group wins at a much-reduced strength.Your bike is your life in Days Gone; in fact, it’s your only vehicle. As such a lot of work was put into the feel of the bike, the upgrade systems, and cosmetics. You start out with a little poop scooter, but through hard work (and a lot of camp credits) you can turn it into a real hog.Riding on the motorcycle feels really fluid, and the controls are meaty without being unresponsive. Days Gone factors in a bit of survival gameplay by having you consume fuel as you ride. Unfortunately, starting out this was infuriating. Apparently, the first gas tank you get holds about a pop can’s worth of gas because you’ll always be running low. Fortunately, you can refill with gas cans you find throughout the world, and at filling stations you run across, and it doesn’t take long to get the first gas tank upgrade which gives you a bit more time on the road before you have to scramble for fuel.You’ll also have to keep your bike in good repair. While the motorcycle is indestructible, it can be disabled if damaged by enemies, submerged in water, or if you ram it into objects. You can use scrap to repair it, but you can only hold a limited amount at a time. This balances the utility and speed of the motorcycle to keep you from just ramming everything in sight and running away.While riding, you’re also vulnerable to enemy attacks. Freakers and animals will grab you off your bike if you get near and ambushing marauders will lay traps for you or try and disable your bike with sniper fire. The vulnerability when you’re in the Oregon wilds, even while on your bike, keeps you from getting too comfortable even later in the game.Even fast travel has its risks in Days Gone. Using fast travel burns up gas at a high rate, and you have to make sure there are no Freaker infestations between you and your destination before you can use it. Taking out an infestation takes time, and can be dangerous if you’re not adequately equipped. Having to weight the risk vs. reward of something as simple as fast travel keeps the survival vibe alive, and keeps Days Gone from being a game where you just warp around the map getting things done as quickly as possible.Regardless of how well I liked the bike, I would have liked to have seen at least someone use a vehicle besides a motorcycle to get around. Everyone who leaves the camps, which not very many do, ride on motorcycles exclusively. The in-game explanation for everyone riding bikes is that tunnels are blocked and the roads are crowded with disabled vehicles. Days Gone suffers a bit from the same issue that other post-apocalyptic works do. Apparently, besides building up the small survivor camps, no one has tried to do anything about actually reconstructing the world.In Days Gone no one has cleared the relatively short tunnels of vehicles to allow passage throughout the region. These people, who are often stretched to the limit when it comes to resources, haven’t managed to figure out logistics beyond the front gates of their camp. There is one region in the game that contains a faction that has somewhat started working on reclaiming the world from the Freakers and marauders, but most of them seem content just to chill out.It struck me as strange that multiple survivor camps, all within a few in-game hours of each other, didn’t cooperate or trade or even fight each other. Seeing some post-apocalyptic politics between the camps would have been interesting. Speaking of which, the world of Days Gone is strangely apolitical. The only person that really talks about the pre-apocalypse government is an Alex Jones-type who runs a survivor camp and broadcasts a radio show called Radio Free Oregon. Though I’m pretty sure the writers wanted you to rally against the dude, he actually makes a lot of sense given the story. Regardless, Deek has to ramble in disagreement after every broadcast for reasons I couldn’t really figure out.As I said above, the overall story is engaging and keeps you going, but the world building itself is somewhat elementary. The Walking Dead works well because it does a great job of showing the rebuilding process when the main lifeform on the earth is a zombie and the tendency for people to get too comfortable when they have the illusion of safety. Unfortunately, Days Gone doesn’t have as in-depth a look at life post-Freaker as I would have liked to see. However, with its concentration on Deek and his journey, it’s a minor gripe in the scheme of things.The fighting in Days Gone is as fluid as the bike riding. There are a plethora of options to approach a situation with the varied arsenal provided. You can go all stealth with a crossbow and suppressed firearms, or you can go in guns blazing with shotguns and light machineguns. Alongside your stock of ranged weapons, you can pick up pickaxes, clubs, baseball bats, and more to get up and personal with the enemy, and if they break then, Deek can always rely on his boot knife.Days Gone also has a skill system that allows you to specialize your play style. The Focus ability is the subject of a few separate skills and enables you to enter a sort of bullet time for more careful aiming. If you’re more into melee, you can unlock skills to increase your physical strength. You can also enhance your health, stamina, and focus stats by using NERO injectors found in NERO camps scattered throughout the game.For all these options, stealth is really the only way to go for most of the game. Deek doesn’t hold enough ammo and explosives to last long against a ton of enemies, and even though mid-late game skills will allow you to increase your storage space, enemies are just too plentiful and powerful to allow a head-on assault in most cases.You can even the odds a bit by crafting. The crafting system is fairly rudimentary. You’ll find rags, styrofoam, beer bottles, and countless other pieces of trash that you can use to craft things like bandages, Molotov Cocktails, and pipe bombs. I liked that the crafting system wasn’t too obtrusive or complicated. Days Gone is a game that very much calls for you to be in the moment, and being able to hold R1 to bring up the inventory and craft a quick smoke bomb or some crossbow bolts allowed me to quickly react to situations without taking me out of the game.Fortunately, the stealth system leads to good gameplay moments. Taking on huge swarms of Freakers, called hordes in-game, becomes a sort of a puzzle. You have to really think about how you’re going to approach a situation and what the most effective use of your limited inventory will be. You can use Proximity and Remote Bombs to plant traps for Freakers and human enemies alike, and it was a lot of fun figuring out how to even the odds when it was just Deek against 300+ Freakers.In the world of Days Gone, though, you can’t ever be sure of safety. Just when you start getting comfortable, you’ll end up getting slammed off your bike by running into a rope that raiders have stretched across the road, or you’ll run into a survivor in a car surrounded by Freakers. Ambient events randomly occur while you’re riding around that will continuously keep you on your toes. Packs of wolves roam the countryside looking for food, along with bears, and marauders are everywhere. You’ll have to deal with all of this in addition to the standard main and side quests found in the game.Days Gone is one of the better zombie games in recent years. It doesn’t beat out the Resident Evil 2 remake (very few games do) as being my go-to zombie fix, but it’s an entertaining if somewhat unevenly-paced adventure through post-apocalyptic Oregon. The gameplay is solid, both the driving and fighting and though there’s not a ton of variety in what you can do, I didn’t hesitate to ride down the next road or shoot the next Freaker.This is a game that doesn’t innovate or do anything new. Instead, it’s one of the titles you start seeing near the end of a console generation that polishes the ideas that other games have introduced. The story is a slow-burn, but once you start getting into it, you’ll want to finish the ride.Sony PR provided Days Gone for review purposes. The game was reviewed on a PlayStation 4 Pro console.8Jason Faulkner is Evolve Media's Senior SEO Editor.

Destructoid,"darkDays Gone feels like it’s a few years too late. Nothing against zombie media, despite the currently dangerous saturation levels, but it’s something you’d typically see released around the height of Walking Dead‘s popularity: before the show started to stagnate creatively and the shambling undead popped up on practically every network.Conversely, I think it spent too much time in the oven. The Days Gone pie is filled with meaty goodness, but you need to pick around the plentiful burnt bits.Days Gone (PS4 [reviewed on a PS4 Pro])Developer: SIE Bend StudioPublisher: SonyReleased: April 26, 2019MSRP: $59.99Days Gone was a strange game for me to assess as it simultaneously tries to endear itself to you and figuratively smack you across the face in seconds flat.Drab post-apocalyptic appearances can be deceiving as the cast is actually likable, including the lead Deacon “Deke” St. John, played masterfully by sci-fi vet Sam Witwer. This is a world that asks you to repetitively babysit your very gamey motorcycle, your main means of travel, and doles out lengthy emotional scenes that are both mysterious and beg to be seen through until the end. Much like the real apocalypse, I’m sure, it’s constantly at odds with itself.Let’s get broad for a moment. Days Gone is a survival-centric open world zombie game that focuses around a non-specific region in the Pacific Northwest. Most of the US is lost to what this universe calls “Freakers,” who mostly come in the quicker, 28 Days Later frenzied variety. Deacon St. John and his best friend William “Boozer” Gray are known as “drifters,” who move from colony to colony amid the chaos, doing odd jobs along the way. Part of what motivates Deacon, beyond the instinct to survive, is the hope that one day he might be reunited with his wife, who was a scientist before the calamity. As you can imagine, these dudes have baggage.It’s not the most original angle, but Days Gone managed to surprise me as the tale of our duo unfolds, hitting on beats of depression and anxiety against the backdrop of a zombie-infested wilderness. That’s because there’s a lot of exposition and narrative scenes: as in, some missions are just watching people talk. We get an inside look at a lot of these characters, including supporting cast members, frenemies, and innocent bystanders. Odds are if they speak, you’re going to get a deep dive into their personality at some point. Nathan Whitehead’s fantastic score backs up all of these emotive uppercuts.To be frank, I did not expect to care this much. There are five-minute scenes that focus on Deacon’s anxiety over locating his wife, and Boozer’s struggle to grapple with the uncertainty of this new world after a particularly harrowing event near the start of the game. These characters get beaten down repeatedly and we spend so much time with them that it works; it reminds me of a primo Frank Miller story in all the best ways that’s worth seeing through. But Days Gone just doesn’t know when to stop. Many of these great moments are strung together by repetitive missions, which allow it to descend into the dark realm of busywork.A very unexciting, tunnel-esque motorcycle ride sequence doesn’t make a good first impression. I can see where SIE Bend was going with creative an attachment to your bike (much like many iconic horses or companions), but the curve goes from tedium at its lowest to apathy at a maximum. For one, you can’t fast-travel if you don’t have the fuel, but some story missions give you unlimited access to fuel. It’s almost like the team knew that it wasn’t a very fun thing to micromanage in a game with a massive open world and used a stopgap solution when they needed to move the narrative along.It can also be gamed pretty easily. If you need to fast travel to a far-away location and can’t afford it, you just travel to the nearest one, look for a fuel source (usually a gas can or a gas pump), refuel, then immediately fast travel again from the menu. You can almost see the playtesting sessions and compromises in real time. The mechanical parts of Days Gone are frequently not congruent with the rest of its tear-jerking sinew.Those kinds of annoyances pop up every hour or so. There’s a really cool part early in the game where you’re running away from a freaker pack in a graveyard as you attempt to jet away with a cooler full of drugs (what an image!). As I sprinted up to my ride, I made sure I had the leeway thanks to a quick Molotov toss reprieve, and attempted to tie the container to the seat to make a quick getaway; only to be greeted by a “defeat enemies first” prompt. I imagined how cool that scene would have been in my head before the arbitrary message appeared and just wondered “why?”Slowly but surely I realized the bike is actually the main source of frustration. It can be damaged during a shootout or a high-octane chase, at which point it’ll start smoking and you’ll need to repair it. There’s no glorious explosion or dramatic noise: it just kind of cuts the engine out and you’ll stop in your tracks. Again, in some story beats, the game will prevent you from repairing or refueling your bike, even if there’s an opportunity to do so. There’s a lot of these little micro-moments where short falls will kill you instantly, you can’t swim for more than a few seconds at a time, and there are several instant-fail stealth sections (that whole faux pas chestnut comes back to roost).That’s to say nothing of the glitches (most of which were minor, including one crash that cost me around 30 seconds of progress). I’m torn on some of the ideas that were clearly meant to be more nuanced. Having items break faster than Breath of the Wild or run out of ammo quicker than a Resident Evil gun is kind of cool. Zombies can swarm you at any moment and having to govern a stamina meter to know when to sprint or dodge is interesting. When a gigantic horde attacks you and you swing the camera back to look at it, it’s a sight to behold.You do hit that point around 10 hours in (of what’s essentially a massive 30-40 hour adventure) where your guns are more effective and hold more ammo, your bike can travel further without falling over to a brisk wind, and the wild as a whole is more interesting to take head-on. I dig the puzzle-like challenges of having to diffuse sound systems for science trailers to gain stat-enhancing upgrades. Taking on a camp with a mix of stealth and head-on combat reminds me of modern Metal Gear Solid.Skill trees, while basic, allow you to build your character the way you want, and freaker hordes (which are basically the main boss battles of the game, with life bars to simulate how many zombies are left) are fun and challenging to smash up against. Then the soundtrack hits you just right and the performances are on-point. Days Gone! You are one confusing beast.Days Gone ups the open world survival ante but doesn’t have enough cash to pay for the rest of the rounds of betting, making it one of the weirdest AAA releases in recent memory. If enough people buy it, its stronger moments will likely be immortalized in YouTube videos for years to come. Yet, most people will probably remember it as the open world zombie game that didn’t bring much mechanically to the table. With some tweaks to the pacing, it could have reconciled its warm, frank look at humanity and been something special.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]AlrightSlightly above average or simply inoffensive. Fans of the genre should enjoy them a bit, but a fair few will be left unfulfilled.

Shacknews,"New to Shacknews? Signup for a Free AccountAlready have an account? Login NowDays Gone gets quite a bit right but falls a bit short in terms of overall polish. Our review.When Sony Computer Interactive Entertainment releases a PS4 exclusive, the gaming world stands up and pays close attention. For years exclusive titles have pushed Sony’s hardware sales forward, and they have delivered some of the best narrative-driven experiences in recent memory. When Days Gone was pitched to fans, the same expectations followed. Bend Studio has fallen short of those expectations, but not all meals have to be gourmet in order to taste good. Days Gone certainly has its flaws, but it isn’t without its share of fun and charm.In Days Gone, gamers will play as Deacon St. John, a biker who is doing quite well for himself in the two years since the virus outbreak that brought about this post-apocalyptic world. It’s clear early on that he’s a damaged man. Having lost Sarah, the love of his life, in the early stages of the outbreak, Deacon now mixes his time between jobs for the various encampments around Oregon and trying to find out what truly happened to Sarah. As players embark on this journey they will be flipping back and forth between present-day horrors and flashbacks to better times. The story Bend Studio is telling in Days Gone is not a short one, and I hit a point of fatigue in the middle waiting for things to pick up, which they do.Unfortunately, the grind to get to the good stuff is long, and the narrative presentation falls short of what I’ve come to expect from a PS4 exclusive. Far too often I would have to click through menus to figure out what my objective was, or I’d discover a new main quest because of a blinking icon on a map instead of a natural transition. It felt more like trudging through mud than flowing freely through water.Thankfully, Days Gone does a lot of gameplay mechanics well, such as the types of Freakers, how they behave, how Deacon’s interactions with them change based on time of day, and a player’s preference for stealth versus guns blazing. During the day, Swarmers, a type of Freaker, will hibernate in infestation nests. During the night they will come out to play, which gives players a choice in how to deal with these infestations. Burn it out during the day and Swarmers will rush out to attack Deacon. Approach during the night and the nest might be empty, but the world around it certainly won’t be. I exercised extreme stealth for the first few nests, but as I got more comfortable, I stopped hiding in bushes as much and started experimenting more.The same concept applies to hordes, which are large groups of Freakers that act as a single entity. If one is alerted to Deacon’s presence, the entire horde is, and that’s something that Bend Studio nailed. Hordes will hibernate during the day, then wander around when it’s dark. I never went out at night if I could help it. Running into a horde is inevitable, though, and my first experience with them was satisfying even though I failed miserably. I was impressed at how they moved and the terror that filled me as I was about to be mauled. I retreated to my safe house to lick my wounds, then left my gameplay session wondering how I could overcome such a force. The next day, I returned to the game and the horde, and managed to kill them all with some clever decisions. That was the moment I graduated into a grizzled survivor in Days Gone.That first experience with a horde taught me a few other things as well, such as to use the world around me to overcome obstacles in unique ways. When I found a camp full of human enemies and a small horde nearby, I just had to make enough noise to get the horde to come check it out, then they cleared the camp for me while I sat in a bush. When I discovered that Rippers, one of the creepier human factions, didn’t attack Freakers, I just had to bring one nearby and it decimated the entire squad.It wasn’t just understanding the world that made life easier, though, it was also leveling up skills and the bike. Deacon earns XP for almost everything he does, and each new level unlocks a skill point to be used at the player’s discretion. These can be used to buy skills in the ranged, melee, and survival categories, allowing players to enhance their preferred play style. Deacon also earns Trust by doing jobs for encampments, and the more he’s trusted the more access he has to buy better guns and upgrades for his bike.Perhaps Days Gone’s best gameplay trick is the connection it builds between Deacon and his bike. It takes about 10 minutes for players to find out how much it sucks without it, and that experience was enough to put the fear of losing it into me for the rest of the journey. Deacon’s bike is one of the only places to save the game and it’s the only way players can fast travel, but most of all it’s a get-of-trouble-free card when fight isn’t an option and flight is mandatory. It’s not as simple as just being near the bike, though, as Deacon must take care of it by not letting it take damage, keeping it fueled up, and even upgrading it with new parts to allow for faster rides, more control, and longer trips. In terms of controls, the bike feels good for the most part, but I found it difficult to judge turns at times, even with several upgrades that should have improved this.Other than the weapon wheel defaulting to weapons I didn’t want to use at times, such as a Pipe Bomb instead of a Molotov, the combat controls are on par with just about any shooter or action game. One good surprise, though, is how the touch pad works. A simple swipe in any direction will instantly bring up the map, story progress, inventory, etc. It’s one of the simplest and yet effective uses of the touchpad I’ve seen.Gameplay in Days Gone is fair, and a lot of that has to do with the bike. If Deacon clears out an infestation, that area will become relatively safe to travel, and there’s a measure of persistence there. Deacon doesn’t kill 12 enemies in a cul-de-sac and come back the next day to find them respawned, and I adore the sense that my work means something.  If I clear out a horde, that horde is gone, and I can then go back without fear of running into them again. Where the bike comes into the picture is with fast travel and fuel. Fast travel between two locations isn’t free. If there’s an infestation between two points, fast travel is blocked until Deacon clears them and the roads are safe. If Deacon doesn’t have enough fuel, he can’t fast travel somewhere. Fast travel isn’t just brainless map clicking, and Bend Studios doesn’t just respawn every enemy endlessly to simulate difficulty, and that part of Days Gone is fantastic.Where Days Gone started to come up short of my expectations was the size of the map, or at least the perception of its size. Most rides to a mission or camp were under 1 kilometer, with long rides coming in around 2.5 kilometers. Bend Studio hides this by fragmenting the world, often putting a big mountain between two sections of the map. The distance between two camps might be 500 meters, but that pushes to 1 kilometer when Deacon finishes riding around the mountain. Unfortunately, there were only a few times that I really felt that motorcycle on the open-road high, but when I did it was good, and it made me want more.Size and larger structure notwithstanding, the visuals suit the narrative and are well presented on a smaller scale, but it’s tough to get those breathtaking visuals into a post-apocalyptic setting where everything is death. Cars on the side of the road and cluttering tunnels tell a story of a frantic last few days for the previous civilization. Homes are a shell of their former selves and NERO (government) checkpoints scattered along the roads paint a grim picture. In the end, though, open-world games for me are about exploring, and I found that tough given that everything was always trying to kill me. There just weren’t enough quiet moments or peaceful corners to let my guard down and sink into it.The biggest visual letdown came in the form of lack of accessibility. I’m severely color blind to the point where I suffer from various symptoms of different types, but it was the red-green problem in Days Gone. Marking enemies put a red marker over their heads, but I just couldn’t see that against the foliage. Unfortunately, there are no settings to fix this.While visuals were up and down, sound design, voice acting, and the soundtrack were generally high points. There were a few audio bugs here and there, but Freakers and hordes sound terrifying, the bike sounds good, and the voice acting and performance capture hold up nicely. I still think it falls a bit short of other PS4 exclusives, but sound design doesn’t let Days Gone down on any level, especially when it busts out tracks like ""Soldier's Eyes"" by Jack Savoretti, which some might recall from Sons of Anarchy, and that should surprise nobody.Ultimately, I will look back on my time with Days Gone fondly. No, it wasn’t on the same level as other PS4 exclusives before it, but as I eluded to in my opening, not all meals have to be gourmet. Bend Studios set out to make a game about a biker in a post-apocalyptic world full of Freakers that aren’t quite human and aren’t quite dead, and it’s generally a fun experience with some clever gameplay choices and a few moments of brilliance.Like a biker, though, Days Gone lacks a certain level of polish. It took me a long time to care about the story that was being told and the characters in it, and it always felt just a bit out of sync for me. I think that’s partly due to the world not feeling very welcoming, which may have been intentional, but robbed me of that precious exploration and downtime that open-world games should offer.Bill, who is also known as Rumpo, is a lifelong gamer and Toronto Maple Leafs fan.

					Bill Lavoy posted a new article, Days Gone review: Meeting Mr. Mayhem "
VG247,"There’s a point about a quarter way into Days Gone where our hero, Deacon St. John, finds looters wrecking the church where he married his missing wife. Deacon is a drifter who makes a living hunting bounties across the Pacific Northwest, monetising the post-apocalypse. He never hesitates to use his gun, though he doesn’t shoot women unless he has to - it’s his code. He’s like a sexist, murderous Batman who wears a backwards cap and a biker gang cut. Twatman.In my playthrough, I clear the holy site with an LMG and grenades, then Deacon does the only logical thing: firebombs the church so nobody can vandalise it ever again.Days Gone is very dumb. 
 
This is a world where many of the characters inexplicably don’t know what antibiotics and lavender are. “Those anti-whatever-they’re-called,” multiple characters say. “There’s this rare plant called lavender,” says another.It’s a world where the anatomy of the big, brutish not-zombies (they’re called freakers and they’re functionally identical to zombies, but they shit themselves) is explained in an audio recording. Apparently this particular breed of freakers were steroid abusers before being infected. Deepest lore.There are two things that set Days Gone apart from other open world games: the fact that a motorbike is your main form of transportation, and there are sometimes thousands of zombies on-screen. The bike is genuinely refreshing - deserts, mountains, and mud-tracked forests take advantage of your maneuverability, and you feel every bump and slide. The hordes are visually impressive, stressful and exciting to deal with, but woefully underused.The plot’s driving force for the first third of the game has you waiting for your best friend to recover from an injury so you can ride north. While you wait for your buddy, Boozer (I swear I’m not making these names up), you ride between encampments and do odd jobs, all while trying to find out what happened to your wife.You’re told Deacon’s backstory via flashbacks of the world before a virus turned everyone into incontinent zombies. You also see how Deacon and his wife were separated in a sequence that feels like a straight-to-DVD rip-off of The Last of Us’s prologue. 
 
To earn these flashbacks, you either drive to a grave site and listen to Deacon monologue about accountants and other mundane stuff, or you tackle one of many instant-fail stealth missions. These quests have you infiltrating government agency landing zones and eavesdropping on scientists. They’re easy enough, but they’re repeated far too often and your only punishment for failure is having to listen to the same dialogue again and again.Listening to the same dialogue on repeat is Days Gone’s kink. It constantly replays conversations for no reason at all. As you explore the open world, radio transmissions come through from characters you’ve met, and there’s so many of them that the game seems to get confused about which ones it’s already played.Those radio conversations, as well as the chats Deacon has with passengers on the back of his bike, clearly weren’t performance captured. The acting in cutscenes is great, with emotions often subtly portrayed with a glance or a slight grimace, but Deacon is in a world of his own when riding his bike. There’s a truther radio station that broadcasts throughout the entire game. Every time the transmission ends, Deacon screams back at the host (who obviously can’t hear him) in one of the most jarring instances of overacting I’ve ever seen.There are other instances where the sound is completely borked. Sometimes, your motorbike’s engine doesn’t make any sound at all, or a distant freaker will scream as if it’s right next to you. Sometimes your guns stop making any noise. Occasionally Deacon shouts over his bike engine when you’re on foot, making him appear deranged. 
 
I’ve had instances where the world fails to load in and I’ve fallen through the map to my death. I’ve been running away from a horde of freakers and accidentally clipped through a truck before its textures and collision loaded in. I had a boss fight with a mutated bear where it just stood there and allowed me to throw molotovs at it until it died. I’ve ran through a tunnel to clear an enemy base, only for all the enemies to spawn in behind me. It’s an extremely pretty game - particularly during sunset and snowfall - but it’s a technical mess.This is before even getting into how prescriptive it is. “This world comes for you” is the game’s tagline, a marker of the developer’s intent. Sony Bend wanted to create a game where the world is threatening and unexpected things can happen as you explore, creating personal stories. In reality, it's a handful of things that can happen in the world endlessly repeating. In missions, it wants you to play a very specific way, too. Go slightly off course and a warning flashes up that you’re leaving the mission area. Keep going and you’re back to a checkpoint.In one mission, I’m driving a girl across the map to a nearby camp. We come to a tunnel and it quickly becomes apparent that this is a trap. I’m expected to get off my bike, kill all the enemies, then go back to my bike and ride through. Fuck that. I just ride through with the kid still on my back seat. As soon as I exit the tunnel, both of us fully intact, I get a mission failed screen for leaving the kid behind - the kid that’s on my back seat.One of the ways the game attempts to create drama in the open world is by making fuel a resource. If you run out of fuel while exploring, you have no choice but to slowly walk your bike to find some. Fast travel becomes locked out. If you’re nowhere near a petrol station or jerry can, fuck you - all you can do is beg for a hill so you can careen for a while. It might make sense on paper, but even Mad Max - a game set in a world where petroleum is gold - provides a crutch for when fuel stores run dry. It’s the kind of thing you thought would be cool in GTA when you were 13, but is actually extremely shit. 
 
Running out of juice isn’t even the only way you can decommission your bike, either. If you get ambushed by survivors - sometimes with wire pulled across the road, sometimes by a sniper - your bike gets wrecked. If you’ve used all your scrap and you’re nowhere near any abandoned cars, you’re in for another slow walk until you find something. Once you’re used to filling up your fuel and collecting scrap at every opportunity, you can negate this all through careful play, but then topping up fuel and scrap becomes a needless layer of busywork instead.Days Gone is a huge, generous game, even if you just mainline the story, but it does everything in its power to pad itself out. Even fast travel is locked behind monotonous repetition. If there are any infected nests between you and a fast travel point, you can’t fast travel - you have to clear out the nests first, which plays out exactly the same every single time.It’s frustrating because the game does pick up in the second half. There are glimmers of Red Dead Redemption in some moments - it’s clear there’s some inspiration here - but it constantly lets itself down with bewildering decisions that pull you out of the fantasy, rather than reinforcing it.The lack of seamless transitions between gameplay and cutscenes means you’re often staring at a black screen as the game interrupts you, the story is predictable, your activities are repetitive, and the technical issues - frame rate drops, freezes, and myriad bugs - are a constant annoyance. While it’s still slightly better than most recent Xbox One exclusives, Days Gone just isn’t anywhere near the quality of the majority of PS4 first-party releases.

Attack of the Fanboy,"Days Gone hit the PlayStation scene in 2019, but it didn’t land with the weighty impact Sony Bend desired. Technical issues and hit-and-miss mechanics turned a strong concept into a mixed bag experience in both the eyes of critics and consumers. Further stacking the deck against it, Days Gone failed to deliver the same pedigree as countless other PlayStation exclusives leading up to its release. The PlayStation 4 had seen its fair share of top-tier exclusives, flexing Sony’s first-party quality and creating a certain expectation. Bloodborne, God of War, and Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End all garnered universal praise, managing Metacritic ratings over 90, with Marvel’s Spider-Man and Horizon: Zero Dawn sitting barely below that prestigious threshold.Days Gone was facing stiff competition from its own camp, and it suffered various setbacks in the eyes of prospective buyers even before launch, furthering its uphill battle. And despite its missteps, our original review found the flawed adventure to be rather enjoyable in spite of its shortcomings. Underneath its issues is an enjoyable, by-the-books open world outing. Following several patches and content additions, it’s time to take another look at Bend’s zombie title and see how it stands two years later empowered by a new platform.For the uninitiated, Days Gone stars Deacon St. John, a drifter-slash-bounty hunter attempting to carve out his place in the ruthless, Freaker-infested outdoors of Oregon. Freakers (read: zombies) roam the land ready to tear unfortunate beings to the bone. And those still among the living have become just as soulless as the undead, prepared to harm their fellow man in unspeakable ways. Two years following a catastrophic pandemic event, Deacon has eked out a living in this unforgiving environment. The narrative that unfolds from here sees our gritty biker protagonist chase down leads to uncover answers about those from his past and puts him in contact with other hardened inhabitants of the lush, green wasteland.Now, I won’t bother reiterating every gameplay mechanic and system in Days Gone. Our PS4 review covers that nicely. The game hasn’t transformed into something else entirely in its move to PC. Most of the original gripes still exist. The bike feels a bit sluggish, aiming isn’t terribly tight, and Deacon still aggressively whispers about virtually everything that is happening. If those rough-around-the-edges aspects bothered you in the console version, then let me inform you that none have seen a drastic overhaul on PC.That said, the PC has removed the configuration confines of Days Gone’s initial console release. Powered by a RTX 3080, i7-10700K, 32GB DDR4, and a Western Digital Black SN750 NVMe SSD, there was considerably more horsepower backing the game during my playtime. No longer was a semi-unstable 30fps on display. Pushing out a silky 60fps was effortless and the framerate could be uncapped to take advantage of higher refresh rate monitors. Seeing Days Gone run at twice (or more) the frames seen in 2019 was an absolute treat. And the added PC graphical options made the world look richer and those extended draw distances didn’t hurt either. In a game where there are lengthy rides between missions, the added visual fidelity is more than welcome.Much like we have seen from other PlayStation titles making the jump to PC, Days Gone is more modifiable than it was on console. Those with the modern components can run a truly stunning game. It may not be enough to entice those that recently tried out Days Gone on PS5, but it is a transformative experience for those that only know the game’s PS4 performance. Ultrawide support and fully remappable keys are sure to please PC enthusiasts looking to dive into Bend’s narrative-driven survival game.The added bells and whistles help further elevate Days Gone above its lesser pieces. The introduction is still a slow burn, but I found more joy in navigating the opening hours unburdened by an inconsistent framerate and technical issues. Sure, enemy AI can still be a bit erratic and unusual, but nothing game-breaking was encountered throughout the campaign. That’s not a claim I was able to make a couple years ago.Additionally, the PC version comes packed with every free content update that made its way to its console counterpart. The Survival difficulty setting and the Challenge Mode’s various trials are included to tack on extra hours to an already lengthy 30+ hour campaign. Survive Freaker onslaughts, quickly clear enemy camps, or put those motorcycle skills to the test in a variety of scenarios to earn player upgrades across all modes. They may not sit as the primary reason to dive back in to Days Gone again and again, but they provide a fun diversion for a while.Days Gone still carries its design flaws, but there is plenty to enjoy in this more traditional open world game. Letting the game breathe on a variety of new hardware will allow a new group of players experience the Freaker-filled narrative without as many bumps as the PS4 pioneers in 2019. For those willing to overlook the clunkiness of some of Bend’s designs, there is a good time to be had in the apocalyptic Pacific Northwest.Days Gone has found a new home on PC. The move hasn’t drastically evolved the experience into one no longer anchored by its biggest negatives, but it has alleviated the technical sticking points of the original release. That makes this all-inclusive package on PC an alluring prospect for those that passed on Deacon St. John’s adventure in 2019, even if it isn’t the finest from Sony’s library.This game was reviewed using a copy of the game provided by the game's publisher,public relations company, developer or other for the express purpose of a review.

Attack of the Fanboy / GAME REVIEWS / Days Gone PC Review"
God is a Geek,"April 26, 2019.Days Gone has been a long time coming. Deveopler Bend Studios are behind some decent games, but this is by far its biggest title to date, and Sony’s pumped their full support behind it to make it a fully fledged first party game. Ever since I played it a slice of it at a preview event, I’ve been keen to get my hands on the post apocalyptic zombie adventure. What I didn’t expect, mind you, were the amount of bugs, annoyances with some of the game’s structure, and the story’s arduous progression, especially towards the end.You follow Deacon St. John; a member of MC Mongrels biker gang. On the day the outbreak swept across Oregon, your wife got attacked, and when an opportunity arose to get her help, Deacon sacrificed himself to send her away on a chopper to receive medical attention. Unfortunately, the chopper goes down and she’s assumed dead. Fast forward a few years and the world is a very different place. You’re left surviving amongst zombie-like creatures called freakers, inhabiting a world in utter disarray, where both the living and the infected are an equal threat.From the get go, you’re tasked with the fundamental goal of surviving. Whilst food and water isn’t a concern of yours, weapons, ammo, and your motorbike are the things you must scavenge for. The survival elements of Days Gone aren’t as tiresome as say, Metal Gear Survive or The Long Dark, but there’re many times where the notion of making each shot count is a must. At times, you can be facing a lot of freakers, and the best cause of action is to run and save your bullets. It constantly serves up a challenge in its moment to moment sections where random encounters are its most tense feature.Equipping weapons whilst you’re out there fighting is incredibly efficient, and the way the inventory wheel works is a blessing. You could be entering a barn or a convenience store and bump into a single freaker, or taking out a full camp of marauders, and the speed at which you try to heal yourself or equip a Molotov is great. Time slows down when the wheel is open, keeping you safe as long as you don’t take too long. Crafting leads to the availability of pipe bombs, medikits, and more, and parts are scattered everywhere from abandoned houses to the boots of wrecked cars or fire engines. There’re plenty of items scattered around so you’re never left completely bare, but taking the time to find these parts is vital.Combat is pretty straightforward. Gun control is satisfying, and the various types provide support in a number of ways. There isn’t a huge range of weapons, but you never really need a a lot. I spent almost all my time with the shotgun, a sniper rifle, and a sawn-off shotgun to take on most of the enemies. Stealth often plays a big part, and at times it’s almost too easy taking out a camp. Soldiers often move in patterns, and there’s plenty of shrubbery to hide in so I never struggled with those parts of the game.Perhaps my favourite part of Days Gone are the hordes. They tend to be out in full force during the night, and when you encounter one for the first time it’s utterly terrifying. Your best strategy is to escape, but the more you play and the better equipment you unlock, there will be times when you can take one out if you’re feeling brave. You can also manipulate them to aid you against settlements of marauders as I did. One of my missions had me trying to wipe out a camp. On the way I encountered a horde, so instead of riding as fast as I could away from them, I teased them into following me, and as I approached the camp I lead the horde into it, letting them rip apart the thugs I was supposed to kill. Watching them scream from afar as the freakers killed them was oddly satisfying, and an example of how Days Gone does have some truly exciting moments.Trying to keep the bike roadworthy can sometimes be a pain, especially if you’re travelling over a long distance. Fuel isn’t that hard to come by, but planning each journey tends to be something you’ll focus more on once you’ve got to grips with how the bike works. Scavenging for scrap is a constant part of the game, as your bike needs to be fixed with it. Land funny after riding off a steep hill, crashing into a freaker, getting picked off by a sniper whilst riding and he hits your engine, or riding through water are all examples of how your bike can get damaged, so you’ll often find your bike will need repairing. Once you unlock the various camps, mechanics can refuel and fix your bike, but there’s not always a camp nearby.One of the first big issues I encountered was the constant struggling the game seems to have when you’re on your bike and you’re travelling across the map. Persistent lagging, even freezing for periods of three seconds or more happen far too much, and when you reach a camp towards the end, it became almost unplayable at certain points. That then translated to when I was walking around, framerate issues kept appearing, and I couldn’t run without it happening. It occurred earlier on too, but not to the same extent as in the latter stages. It’s worth noting that these issues are eliminated when using a PS4 Pro, but on a standard PS4 this game does have issues.As the story unfolds, you’ll unlock new camps, and it’s at these where you can upgrade your bike’s acceleration, add a nitro boost, improve durability, and more. It’s important to keep your bike in tip top shape because some of the later missions involve chasing down other dudes on bikes, and they’ll shoot at you, gain distance between you, and always find ways to outsmart you, so bike maintenance is key. Each camp also provides a merchant where you can restock ammo, as well as buy new guns, explosives, and mods like suppressors. Most of the stock won’t become available until you’ve gained the trust of the camp by completing various missions for them.There’re other benefits to the camp, like the ability to hand in freaker ears for more credits, as well as food you’ve hunted from the various wildlife still alive out there. There are missions where random survivors need a hand in certain situations, and once saved you can choose which camp to send them to, offering different rewards depending where you send them. With the way the story progresses, I was left feeling like I should be ignorant of the first few camps because the bulk of the second act took place in a third camp, and it felt more beneficial to just work on that one.Fast travelling is available, but sometimes you’ll have to take out infestations in certain areas because the game won’t allow you to travel through. It also costs fuel to fast travel, so even if you’ve cleared areas out, a lack of fuel won’t let you. There are story-missions in the game where fuel isn’t a factor in it, and this makes the game break its own rules. If fast travel could just happen without fuel being a factor I would’ve used it a lot more. This became a pain with certain missions because at times you’re constantly going from one end of the map to the other, and it can take a lot of time, especially if you’ve not got the right tools to clear out these infestations.Enemy types aren’t particularly varied either. Swarmers make up the bulk of the enemies, and they’re essentially the standard freakers. Newts are children that have been infected and they tend to gather around buildings. Taking these out feel different, and they won’t attack you unless you get too close. You’re introduced to an enemy called a Breaker (a bulky tank-like freaker), but from the first encounter to the next, it’s at least seven or eight hours. It isn’t the be all and end all, but seeing more of the Breakers would’ve been more of a challenge. When they do come back, you’ll see plenty of them, but it takes a substantial amount of time to face them again, and they’re a lot easier to kill the second time around.Throughout the game, you’ll earn XP for completing a wide range of missions, and by doing so you’ll get skill points to use on three distinct skill sets: Melee, Ranged, and Survival. Some will help the amount of damage you do with weaponry, improve your focused shot (think Dead Eye in Red Dead Redemption 2), and plenty more improvements to the game. Each set is tiered, and the more you unlock the better the skills are in the next tier. Jumping between your skills, the map, your inventory, and story progression can be opened with a quick swipe on the Touch Pad. It’s a nice little feature that adds more efficiency to the game, especially as you’ll spend a fair amount of time in each menu.When it comes to the story of Deacon St. John, there were times I was engrossed in everything that was happening. The love he still holds for his wife and the desperate hope he clings to, his powerful friendship with other Mongrels member Boozer, and the constant conflict he finds himself in as he struggles to uphold his beliefs. For the most part, it flows rather well, but there are times when you’re left annoyed with how certain aspects of the story unfold. At one point, after I’d spend a lot of time watching a story arc unfold, believing I was reaching the end of the game, another section opened up and it felt like I was nowhere near seeing how Deacon’s journey ended. At that point I felt like the story was reaching a natural conclusion, but there was a lot more to play and it began to drag.You’ll also play through flashbacks to a time before the outbreak, and as poignant as the cutscenes are, the gameplay involved is completely unnecessary. Long walks without any running and pointless objectives make them feel like they should solely be told via these cutscenes, something I would’ve been much happier watching. The voice acting is superb, and I really cared for Deacon. Boozer is also spectacular, and as their friendship evolves I was left in awe of how Bend Studios managed to convey the powerful nature of specific scenes through excellent animations and direction.Whilst there are many plus points when it comes to the story, I encountered a wealth of bugs and glitches beyond the lagging when on the bike. I had rabid wolves freeze whilst still growling which lead to easy kills, and enemies freeze after I’d stealth killed them, only for them to remain on their feet. I had a load screen get stuck, causing me to quit the game then load back in, only for the cutscene that followed the load screen to be half way through, making me miss a substantial segment of it. I also had a cutscene take place in slow motion with no sound at all.Sometimes the mission structuring is poorly balanced. There were other points where you leave a camp only for a minute later the same camp radio you with a mission, meaning you have to ride back. Sometimes you’ll have no missions at all, and the radio goes off when you’re even further away from the camp. This happened multiple times and became one of my biggest frustrations. The audio is also poorly mixed. Sometimes Deacon would shout when he doesn’t need to, or when talking to a survivor they seem to almost whisper their response. As mentioned, the voice acting is great, but Deacon unnecessarily shouts and it’s very odd indeed.Days Gone is fantastic at times, but there’re so many bugs that I wasn’t sure if the game was stable enough to continue. Being a Sony first party game, I expected so much more, especially as we’ve been blessed with games like God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, and Marvel’s Spider-Man in recent years. The hordes are excellent, and portions of the story are great, but pacing towards the end, a wealth of issues in the gameplay and its technical side make the journey through a destroyed Oregon a real burden at times that I came away more disappointed than impressed.The story is great at times
Survival elements are good
Hordes are terrifyingPlenty of bugs throughout
Missions structure becomes frustrating
Audio has some bad mixing at times
Fast travel is poorly executedDays Gone has some moments of brilliance, but there're far too may bugs. The hordes improve the game drastically, it's just a shame that a lot of the game suffers in other avenues. Your home for all your videogame needs.
