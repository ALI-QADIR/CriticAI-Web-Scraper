Eurogamer,"Hanna-Barbaric.In the 1930s, employees at Universal Studio Cartoons devised a game to interrupt the bow-backed routine of inking cels and preparing animation frames. The men would work rubber bands and clumps of spit-mulched paper into spongy balls, hide them on their laps and, at an opportune moment, hurl the missile at the back of an unsuspecting colleague's head. A direct hit would be marked with a ""bullseye!"" that victory cry familiar to boisterous classrooms and offices everywhere, before everyone returned to their busywork, newly invigorated by the emotions of exhilaration, anguish and playful resentment now settling in the room.Shortly after he joined the company, Tex Avery, the Texan animator who would develop and popularise cartoon characters such as Daffy Duck, Droopy, Porky Pig and Chilly Willy, was busily working when he heard a co-worker shout a warning. Avery spun in his chair just in time to catch one of the projectiles in his left eye. This missile, however, was different: it had been weaponised with a thumbtack. Avery was instantly blinded in one eye. Robbed of depth perception, some speculate that the injury resulted in the unique, chaotic style of Avery's subsequent, era-defining cartoon work.50 years later, the emerging video game medium's art style was similarly funnelled and defined, not by the limitations of physical injury, but by the limitations of technological crudity. The chunky pixels, the three-head-tall characters, the graph-paper mazes, the backgrounds that scrolled like a slow-motion deck shuffle: video game development's artistic minds were forced to work in tight corridors of possibility. With time the boundaries scraped outwards, and games were no longer forced to share a family likeness. As style diversified, nostalgia for the old ways of working and seeing emerged and today the vintage aesthetic of the medium's earliest days is as commonplace as any other. Cuphead is a mash-up of these two stories, two rich traditions that have never before been blended with such gusto. It draws together the continents of 1930s animation, where every inanimate object, insect and mammal had wide eyes and moved with a bobbing, metronomic rhythm, and that of early 2D video games, with their simple rules and exacting, often cruel, demands. The novelty of the effect is astounding and long-lasting. This is not the first playable cartoon, but it is the first whose spell is weaved from and held by impeccably observed period detail - the washed-out tones, the brittle dialogue, the weirdly familiar characters, the fidgety appearance of hair and dust particles on the screen, as if the game was being luxuriously reeled off film and projected onto your widescreen TV via a hot lamp.  The titular character, a china cup boy in short shorts who shoots pellets by clicking his fingers with beatnik cool, is as recognisable as any Avery creation. So too is the pig that sells you upgrades, the ghost who counts your deaths or the devil against whom you ultimately fight, having beaten and collected the souls of his various eccentric minions. Artistic coherence extends far beyond the drawing board. See how every anthropomorphic object, from the sand timer used in loading screens to the devilish gobstoppers and slices of cheery toast you battle dips on its knees in time with the musical rhythm. And what rhythms they are: the rolling timpani, the chirruping flutes, the fluttering oboes, those startling stabs of trumpet, each instrument giving shape to thick dark rumbas, Dixieland fights of jazz, and the occasional piece of Tinseltown schmaltz. As a period piece of animation and music, Cuphead is peerless and immaculate.The structure, too, is familiar. Here, brothers Chad and Jared Moldenhauer, who started the project as a hobby before going all-in on the indie dream, re-mortgaged homes and all take their cues from Dark Souls (Cuphead even borrows Hidetaka Miyazaki's screen-squishing catchphrase ""You Died!"" for its game-over text). Cuphead must explore three islands in sequence, collecting, one by one, the souls of his marks in order to clear the path to the next. These marquee fights are extravagantly designed, with screen-filling characters that move through various phases of attack as you pepper them with your chosen ammunition. The designs are ingenious. See the red-faced genie, with his weaponised turban who, in his final phase, whips out a dangling puppet to do his fighting. Or the fat-faced jester who inflates balloon-dogs that attack you while, every now and again, sending over a toothy rollercoaster. Boss battles are interspersed with a few run-and-gun platform levels, while in another repeated vignette, you must protect a genie from the lunging attacks of ghosts by 'parrying' their attacks with a second stab of the jump button. Regardless of the stage type, the difficulty is wincingly high throughout. By default, it's three strikes and out for Cuphead (although you can add a health point by buying the appropriate upgrade). Even with seeker projectiles and other improvements installed, it will take even an accomplished player many attempts to learn and master the patterns of a single boss. Few will see it through.In part the difficulty is a function of a lack of clear on-screen information. Cuphead is a game, you sense, in which the artist won more arguments than the game designer. Every decision has been made in service to the aesthetic. Crucial information such as your lives, or how many screen-filling specials you have in stock is relegated to the bottom left of the screen, forcing your eyes to make perilous diversions. Enemies have nothing so vulgar as a health bar, but neither do they give any visual indication of how close they are to expiring, by turning redder, for example. This ensures that the game's pristine presentation is never compromised or cluttered. It also ensures that what is already a highly punitive game is made all the meaner. It is, however, mostly fair. This is not a Japanese bullet hell kind of shooter, where enemy bullets create a non-negotiable maze. There are, at any given moment, usually only one or two active threats on screen at a time. Difficulty derives from the combination of these threats (e.g. a sunflower's finger-like roots that jab up through the soil at the exact moment an airborne venus fly-trap descends from the sky). Managing space in between these constantly moving and mixing threats demands not only great skill but also some luck; it's possible to become boxed into unwinnable situations.As a result, Cuphead is as frustrating as it is exhilarating. There are Dark Souls-esque moments of extreme elation. But Miyazaki's series balances its brutality with moments of serenity and downtime, and pushes players forward with an alluring sense of constant acquisition (of both fine-motor skills in the hands, and ever-stronger weapons in the inventory). These traits are missing from Cuphead, for which the only route to progress is Karate Kid montage-style training and perseverance. The result is a curious combination: a wondrous, everyman style with a dizzying, elitist substance.

Not so much a boss rush as a boss crawl, Studio MDHR’s outstanding debut pits you against some of the toughest enemies you’ll face in a videogame, and the process of beating them can be slow and sometimes painful. But when you eventually do, the surge of euphoria is undeniable. Its difficulty hasn’t been understated, then, but crucially, it’s hardly ever the game’s fault if you get hit. You’ll shout and swear plenty, but you’ll know it’s really yourself you’re annoyed with.

Within seconds of a battle kicking off, you often find yourself fending off threats on multiple fronts, simultaneously tracking Cuphead’s position but also keeping an eye on something hovering ominously above, another threat incoming on ground level, and another projectile or five floating somewhere in between. With just three hit points, you’ve precious little margin for error; as such, once you’ve begun to acclimatise to a particular attack pattern, you’ll find yourself restarting if you take damage during that phase. That’s the first sign that Cuphead’s got its hooks into you. And then suddenly you’ll deliver the killing blow and the wave of relief and satisfaction is overwhelming. The clock will say it took you two or three minutes, but such is the relentless, exhausting intensity of these fights that each attempt feels five times as long. 

That feeling might not be worth persevering for if the controls weren’t immaculate. Equipped with a reliable jump and dash, Cuphead is nimble and responsive, his handling so expertly calibrated than an analogue stick—hardly ideal, you’d think, in a game designed for digital precision—never feels like a handicap. A parry move that lets you slap back any pink projectiles by hitting jump again in mid-air can occasionally seem a little fussy in its timing. Still, it’s used intelligently, letting you build your special meter—which can be spent in increments or saved for a huge blowout—and also doubling as a method of traversal.These are simple ingredients, but Studio MDHR builds a series of thrillingly diverse encounters around them. Bosses don’t just limit themselves to a host of different attack patterns, but adopt several distinct forms. Some play out like pursuits, while others are confined to a single, claustrophobic space. In one stage you’ll use the parry to nudge a handcar forward or back as you race alongside a train; in another you’ll slap springboards to clear a tall enemy. Meanwhile, random elements keep things fresh, meaning you can’t simply learn patterns by rote and rely entirely on muscle memory.A huge part of Cuphead’s appeal is seeing what bizarre monstrosity awaits you next.I’m skimping on specifics, but that’s because a huge part of Cuphead’s appeal is seeing what bizarre monstrosity awaits you next. Not that you’ll have much time to marvel at the astonishing hand-drawn animation, because you’ll be so laser-focused on surviving as soon as the announcer’s dispensed with the formalities. It’s only after the fact that you can really appreciate the ingenuity of the animation and design of these encounters. And it’s not just a pretty face either, with a big band soundtrack that comes close to matching the visuals, one highlight of which is an uptempo jazz number that briefly segues into Ride of the Valkyries.Cuphead’s bosses can be tackled on two difficulty settings: Simple (which is a barefaced lie) and Regular (hard). Beat them on Simple and you’re allowed to progress, but doing so locks out the finale, meaning you’ll miss out on a not-insubstantial chunk of the game. It’s only so useful learning the ropes this way, since many bosses use different attack patterns on Regular, or adopt a new form you won’t see at all on Simple. In other words, to see everything, you’re going to have to do it the hard way.Difficulty is subjective, of course, but while there’s no doubt some idiots out there who will claim Cuphead is too easy, most will find it a tough nut to crack. Whether it’s fair is a more important consideration. And the answer is: mostly. On occasion it isn’t, and it’s often those variables that spoil things, with platforms and enemies positioned in such a way that you take an unavoidable hit through no real fault of your own. Such incidents are relatively rare, but in a game as demanding as this, it’s frustrating that you do sometimes need a hint of luck to get by. In a game that earns your trust by establishing its rules and staying true to them, there are a few moments where it doesn’t quite hold up its end of the bargain.Still, 95 percent firm-but-fair to five percent bullshit is a more than acceptable ratio for what has clearly been a labour of love. There’s not a whiff of cynicism about Cuphead: from its aesthetic to its systems, it’s wilfully off-trend, and utterly its own thing. As tough as it gets, ultimately that’s what’s really worth shouting about.Not just for the masochists, Cuphead is a demanding but supremely rewarding modern 2D shooter that looks and sounds fantastic.14 console games that should've been on PC instead2023's most slept-on horror game is getting an absolutely sadistic new mode where nearly everything's randomized and you have to spend precious fuel just to saveSteam's most wishlisted city builder, Manor Lords, announces 2024 early access launch dateBy Ian Evenden13 October 2023By Tom Hatfield12 October 2023By Harvey Randall12 October 2023By Rick Lane10 October 2023By Jorge Jimenez9 October 2023By Jacob Ridley5 October 2023By Phil Iwaniuk4 October 2023By Dave James4 October 2023By Morgan Park4 October 2023By Jon Bailes2 October 2023By Alex Blake2 October 2023PC Gamer is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Metro GameCentral,"The most unique visuals of the year belong to a video game that mixes Contra style action with creepy 1930s cartoons.Because games companies are always so secretive about their budgets, the miracles that some indie developers manage to work, with their much more limited resources, often go uncelebrated. Whereas some big name games can have up to a thousand people working on them Cuphead started with just two. It expanded a little after the acclaim for the debut trailer, and especially after Microsoft signed the game up as an exclusive, but the studio is still tiny compared to most major developers.But the most extraordinary fact, as we learnt when we interviewed the producer in August, is that while they did hire some experienced animators afterwards, the core team taught themselves how to ink and animate purely from reading books and watching old 1930s cartoons. The result is the most distinctive-looking video game of the year, and yet one that doesn’t have a single polygon in sight.What exactly Cuphead is has often been unclear in its long journey towards release, but it’s actually fairly simple. Although there are some other elements to it, Cuphead is primarily a collection of, usually single-screen, boss battles done in the gameplay style of 2D platform shooters such as Contra and Metal Slug. There’s around 30 in total and almost all of them are fantastic, which is not something we say lightly about Western-made boss fights. What they also are though is extremely hard. Devilishly hard, you might say…Where the idea to do any of this came from we still don’t really understand, but the whole 1930s cartoon aesthetic is recreated absolutely perfectly. It’s not just that the game mimics the art style and animation so accurately, but that the actual character designs are so wonderfully weird and imaginative. Whether they’re an evil potato or the devil himself every character, even the heroes, manages to look strangely sinister in the way that cartoons of that era always seemed to.The story involves the titular Cuphead, and his co-op companion Mugman, fighting for their souls after being duped at a diabolical casino. This leaves them with no option but to collect the souls of previous debtors, who appear in the form of everything from an evil-looking clown made out of balloons to a giant cigar and an animated bottle of scotch.These are all fantastic simply as character designs, but they’re also surprisingly varied when it comes to the gameplay. Each has a wide range of different attacks, many of which are randomised in terms of the order they come out. So while you can learn the tells that proceed each one you can’t simply learn the whole fight by rote.Your character has a fairly simple set of abilities, and can employ up to two different weapons, that can be switched between at any time, and a constantly charging, two-stage special attack. You can also free aim while standing still and whenever you see a pink object you can jump onto it to get a bonus or interact with it in some other way.Some levels take the form of horizontally-scrolling 2D shooters such as Gradius or R-Type, although they’re still elongated boss battles. The only ones that aren’t are on-foot sections that are much closer to a normal Contra or Metal Slug stage. There’s only two of these per world though and they’re purely optional, although they are the only place to pick up coins in order to buy new weapons. They work fine, and the level design is good, but they don’t feel as unique as the bosses and we weren’t upset there wasn’t more of them.Mechanically the game works perfectly, with responsive and reliable controls, although we did keep imagining that a good arcade joystick would be the preferred control system. But that may just have been one of the many excuses we made to ourselves when we keep dying. This is a viciously difficult game and there’s no pretending that’s not going to severely limit its audience. There is an easier difficultly setting but even that is very difficult, and using it doesn’t unlock the final boss fight.Alan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNew Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart bundle is £50 off reveals leakXbox will be less hands-off with Bethesda amid major reorganisationIt’s not as if playing it with a friend (locally only at the moment, but with an online option to come) helps much either, as on just a single screen the other player more often than not becomes an unwanted distraction. All that said, playing the game did result in us uttering the fateful phrase ‘just one more go’ more times than almost any other game this decade, and that’s always a good sign.But we can’t help wishing that the game hadn’t been quite so ruthless in its difficulty, as it seems entirely unnecessary given how intrinsically fun the experience is and how reasonable its pricing is for the amount of content. Especially as our only other real complaint is the understated sound design for your bullets, which are much too quiet. It may seem a small point but it undermines an important part of the overall sensory experience, and makes it difficult to tell how much damage you’re doing.We have no idea what developer Studio MDHR is going to do after this, but Cuphead is a stunning artistic achievement. It shows how it’s not money that makes great games but creative people, even if those same people seem determined to make life difficult for themselves and everyone else.In Short: A stunning work of imagination, with a collection of high quality boss battles to rival any other in gaming – and a difficultly level that’s equally hard to beat.Pros: Incredible visual design and equally impressive, and varied, boss mechanics. Period perfect presentation and music, and a significant amount of content for the price.Cons: Sky high difficulty will be overwhelming for many, and the two-player co-op doesn’t help much. Weak sound effects make it difficult to judge how much damage is being dealt.Score: 8/10

Metro GameCentral,"After becoming a cult classic on Xbox One and Switch, 2D shooter Cuphead finally arrives on PS4 and it’s just as good as ever.The history of indie gaming is filled with unexpected success stories, but Cuphead is up there with the best of them. Canadian developer Studio MDHR had never released a game before and yet they decided to start with a homage to old school 2D shooters using an art style inspired by even older school cartoons from the 1930s. Although the most incredible thing is at that point they knew absolutely nothing about traditional animation. Several years later and they produced one of the most visual distinctive games of the current generation – and now it’s finally on PlayStation 4.Cuphead started off as an Xbox exclusive, before slowly migrating to the PC and then Nintendo Switch, where by that point it had become famous enough to earn a costume in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and a cartoon series on Netflix. This PlayStation 4 version isn’t quite the end of its story though as there’s still a DLC expansion to be released yet, which, like the main game, has been delayed several times already.Purely from a visual perspective, Cuphead is a remarkable work of art, mimicking the creepy animation style of early cinema perfectly and filled with characters and situations that are just as surreal, as you fight everything from animated vegetables to balloon clowns and the devil himself. Apart from some strangely weedy sound effects the presentation is absolutely pitch perfect and almost worth the price of entry before you consider what the game itself is like.In gameplay terms Cuphead is heavily influenced by late ‘80s/early ‘90s 2D shooters such as Contra and Metal Slug. But while there are a few side-scrolling layers peppered throughout the game these are merely palette cleansers, as most levels are elongated boss encounters. The whole game is essentially a boss rush mode, which again is a very risky thing to attempt as Western developers have a pretty abysmal track record when it comes to mimicking Japanese style boss battles – and yet Cuphead nails it almost every time.The visual diversity of the enemies you face is matched by their own unique abilities and tactics, with some relying on hordes of underlings, some forcing you into on-rails shooter sequences reminiscent of Gradius et al., and others being almost puzzle-like in terms of the steps you must take to defeat them. Although the one thing they all have in common is that they’re mercilessly difficult, even on the lowest possible setting.It’s a contentious issue, but we always felt the difficulty was just a little too perverse in Cuphead, although since its release we’ve heard many stories of people who have conquered it despite never having any experience with such games and generally not considering themselves to be especially skilled.What the game’s design excels at is making every new encounter seem absolutely impossible the first couple of tries, until gradually you learn the enemy’s weaknesses and tells, and what first seemed hopeless eventually becomes almost trivial – at least compared to whatever comes next. (Although we still think the run ‘n’ gun sections, with the instantly respawning enemies, are a step too far and would’ve been a lot more fun if they’d been dialled back just a little.)I beat Spider-Man 2 in 14 hours and I want my money back - Reader’s FeatureOnly 1% of Netflix users are taking advantage of a free little-known perkAlan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepThere’s no attempt to change anything in the PlayStation 4 version, which given the game’s success makes complete sense. As you’d expect, Sony’s console has no problem running the game, so this is to all extents and purposes identical to the previous releases. The original Xbox One version is getting an update in the future, that adds a digital art gallery and behind the scenes commentary, so we assume that will also eventually make it to the PlayStation 4 as well, but that’s it in terms of new content.It’s taken three years for Cuphead to become truly multiformat and we’ve enjoyed replaying it every time. Ironically, a game which looks so far back in time for inspiration, for both its visuals and its gameplay, already feels timeless and makes us very eager to experience whatever comes next from both the developer and Cuphead and Mugman themselves.CLICK HERE FOR THE ORIGINAL FULL REVIEW OF CUPHEADIn Short: One of the best 2D shooters of the modern era is also one of the most visually distinctive games of the whole generation, and a stunning work of imagination on every level.Pros: Amazing visuals, from both a design and artistic perspective. Wonderfully varied boss battles with barely a dud in the whole game. Huge amount of content and near perfect presentation.Cons: The difficulty level is absolutely brutal from the first moment, even on the supposedly easier mode, and it’s often hard to justify why.

Our two demitasse-domed heroes made the mistake of gambling their souls at the Devil's casino, and must pay off their debt by besting the many bosses who reside on Inkwell Isle. Right from the title screen, Cuphead douses you in its charm, greeting you with an adorable animation and a barbershop quartet crooning about the beverage-brained brothers' current predicament. Few games capture a distinct medium and mood as well as Cuphead, which channels every aspect of cartoons from the 1930s, in the vein of Fleischer Studios' Betty Boop shorts and Disney's Silly Symphonies. ""Cuphead's presentation pops in every imaginable way""Faithfully hand-drawn, painstakingly cel-animated characters bounce gleefully with each frame, flashing toothy smiles that range from cheery to dastardly. The gorgeous watercolor backdrops are on par with those in Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, unveiling a stunning wealth of detail upon closer inspection (provided you can rip your attention away from the lavishly animated action). And the soundtrack is an absolute hoot, bursting with jazzy big band numbers and sprightly ragtime ditties. Perhaps it was the high of finally downing some particularly tough bosses, but the tune accompanying the post-fight victory screen often had me jauntily snapping my fingers to the beat like a man possessed.  The '30s throwbacks pervade every last detail. Load screens clue you into the persistent visual filter that replicates the look of a vintage film reel, backed by the comforting white noise of a vinyl record's distinct crackle. Everyone speaks in booming, echoey, distant-sounding voices - from the snouted shopkeeper at Porkrinder's Emporium, to your co-op buddy bellowing ""Thaaank you!"" whenever you rescue them - akin to the unforgettable ""Don't you believe it!"" bit from classic Tom and Jerry. Dialogue during the brief bits of story include multiple exclamations of ""Golly!"" and ""Hot dawg!"" Cuphead's presentation pops in every imaginable way, and the old-school cartoon stylings pair beautifully with the retro 16-bit era gameplay. ""We quit our jobs, remortgaged our houses"" - how relentless passion made Cuphead a realityYou should think of Cuphead as a series of increasingly difficult boss fights, though there are a small handful of platforming ""Run & Gun"" levels mixed in. Each encounter pits you (and a friend, in two-player couch co-op) against a larger-than-life opponent with an entirely unique set of attacks, cues, and weak points. Fights tend to take under three minutes, but that's usually after you've carefully studied your enemy's multiple phases over the course of many, many failures. This is the kind of game where, once you've gotten your bearings, any early damage you take should probably default to a quick, painless retry. Progress is only palpable through your rising skill: there are no checkpoints, no mid-battle health pickups, and no methods for cheesing through a fair fight. All you can depend on are your wits, reflexes, infinite lives, and the tightly tuned controls. Cuphead's handling is so intuitive that before long, quick-dodge dashing, eight-way firing, and jump-parries that nullify any attack color-coded pink (which quickly becomes crucial to your success) will feel like second nature.Classic inspirations are apparent all throughout Cuphead, with callbacks to genre godfathers like Mega Man, Contra, Metal Slug, and Gunstar Heroes - but always with some unique twist, elevating their designs above nostalgic mimicry. Every imaginative encounter tests your skills in some surprising, rousing new way - including welcome shmup skirmishes that keep things varied, as you blast your adversaries in an adorable biplane that can shrink to make dodging a teensy bit easier. If you've collected enough coins from the brief, far-less-difficult Run & Gun stages, you can purchase additional weapons and passive boosts to hone your playstyle - and every powerup has its place. I was certain I had equipped the only two weapons I would ever need, only to find that all six flavors of firing had their time to shine against certain bosses.Never did I feel frustrated by Cuphead, even after repeatedly failing on the last smidgen of a boss' health bar (which is only visible after your death). No boss felt insurmountable, like some brick wall I'd be slamming my head against until I scraped out a desperate win. Cuphead's peppy, immaculate presentation just has this way of soothing any mounting slipups like some invigorating salve; even the quippy taunts that bosses spout whenever you die brought many a giddy smile to my face. And when you finally do triumph over a trickier boss, oh, what a feeling. Victory is always well-earned, whether you're cutting your teeth on the Simple difficulty or entering the Regular ring (which you'll have to step up to if you want to finish the game - and unlock the boss-amping Expert mode). ""I'm mighty excited for an Expert encore""There's also a pleasant amount of metagame to explore within the Inkwell Isles. The overworld is rife with secrets and creative methods of progress: you can seek out new pathways to take on an area's five bosses in a flexible order, NPCs give you optional quests via cryptic clues, and coins and shortcuts are hidden out of sight. It's a bit strange, then, that there aren't a few more amenities thrown in that the modern player might be expecting. You're graded after each stage, but you have no easy way to check your records, and there aren't any leaderboards to see where you stand. At launch, local is the only way to co-op play (though there are plans to add online later). But these all feel like minor gripes in a complete package where even the smallest feature was crafted with care. Heck, the Devil's second-in-command, King Dice, has an entire song dedicated to him - which only plays in tiny, combat-free rooms that most players will cruise right on through. That kind of ancillary-but-appreciated effort reminds me of Skullmonkeys' ""Little Bonus Room"" song that's near and dear to my heart.Yes, Cuphead was worth the wait. Too often, I find myself thinking ""Thank God I never have to do that again"" after wrapping up a difficult game - but with Cuphead, I'm mighty excited to further my eight-to-nine-hour Regular run by trouncing those bosses in an Expert encore. If you're partial to a tough-but-fair challenge, and you have even the slightest appreciation for the rich history of animated cartoons, you'll be overjoyed by the wonderfully artistic adventure that is Cuphead. Maybe you'll even get a blistered thumb or two to remember it by.This game was reviewed on Xbox One.Are you in love with Cuphead's challenge?

Game Informer,"Cuphead made me shout obscenities at a flower. Its cheerful dragon tempted me to head-butt my television. And the candy princess? Oh, you don’t even want to know. I didn’t appreciate it until much later, but those early maddening hours with Studio MDHR’s run-and-gun platformer were like a kiln, hardening my skills and turning me into the best damned Cuphead player that I could be. That trial by fire is ultimately one of the most satisfying parts of the overall experience, but players who just want to enjoy its unique aesthetic are going to get burned.The hand-drawn animation is mesmerizing, and makes for one of the most visually appealing games I’ve played in years. Studio MDHR faithfully recreated nearly every facet of classic animation from the ‘20s and ‘30s, from the title cards that introduce each stage to the jazzy score that accompanies the action. If you have any fondness for that era, you’re in good hands. Going into the game, I wondered if there would be certain homages to long-lost techniques, and, without spoiling some of the most satisfying little moments of the game, the answer is “Yep!” The attention to detail is wonderful, and I was immediately pulled into its scratchy Technicolor world. But once I got there, I was in for a surprise.
 
Cuphead may lure you close like the visible aroma from a cartoon pie, but its difficulty is the windowsill slamming shut on your hands. Studio MDHR was inspired not only by classic animation, but by tough arcade games that fed off a steady diet of quarters. The bulk of Cuphead is built around boss battles, each of which has several different phases. They can be knocked out in a couple of minutes, but that assumes you’ve mastered the various tricks each one requires. You have unlimited continues, but no checkpoints or shortcuts through the encounters. When you fail – and you will fail – you have to fight that boss from its opening moments again. This approach walks the razor-thin balance beam between being frustrating and rewarding, and it mostly succeeds. About half the time I finally landed the final blow on a boss, I’d cheer. The other times, I’d flip it the bird with both hands. You can play simplified versions of the boss fights, but you won’t get to see many of the game’s best moments. You also need to beat them on the regular difficulty if you want to fight the last pair of bosses. Trust me, it’s worth it.Compared to the intense boss encounters, the run-and-gun action levels feel uninspired, full of straightfoward enemy gauntlets and platforming challenges. These sections aren't nearly as interesting as the rest of the game, and include some of Cuphead’s worst moments, such as a poorly implemented gravity-swapping section and a few fatal end-of-stage surprises that feel more like active trolling. Unfortunately, they’re the main source of gold coins, which you need to buy additional weapons and special abilities. Fortunately, these levels aren't numerous, and you never have to revisit them once you get all the coins.Those weapons and abilities add a welcome wrinkle to Cuphead. You can equip two weapon types, one of three ultimate attacks, and a special charm. At first, I gravitated toward abilities that gave me additional health. Then I got better at the game and found that I wasn’t getting hit nearly as often. At that point, I switched to a power that let me avoid damage by dashing, and that changed everything. The arsenal is small but diverse, and part of the fun is finding a loadout that works best for you. On several occasions, when I thought a boss was impossible, I breezed through it after picking the right tools. Getting good at the parry ability, which allows you to slap away pink projectiles, is also key. When I got stuck, I enlisted help through local co-op. By bringing along a buddy (who plays as Cuphead’s friend, Mugman), you can revive your comrade if you manage to parry their ghost before it floats to the top of the screen. I thought this would be overpowered, but it comes with a tradeoff: Sharing space with another character can be distracting, especially when you need to watch out for subtle tells that the bosses have before attacking. I got through some tricky stages thanks to co-op, but I managed to beat the rest of it solo, so assistance isn't a requirement.Cuphead is a singular experience. Studio MDHR knew what it wanted to make, then went ahead and made it. A tough boss-rush game based on classic animation archetypes? It shouldn’t work, but here we are. It’s fun to play, and possibly even as satisfying to watch, since you can fully absorb what’s going on screen. It would have been easy to dial down the overall difficulty (and I wouldn’t have complained), but that wouldn’t have been Cuphead, either. Stick with it, is all I can say. We don't often get something that will make you laugh and grind your teeth in such close proximity.

   on April 18, 2019 at 8:15AM PDTEverything you've heard about Cuphead is true. It is a difficult side-scrolling shooter with relentless boss battles that demand rapid-fire actions and reactions. Think for too long, and you won't stand a chance against the game's toughest enemies. Battles may only last three minutes at most, but they feel far longer when you know that you can only absorb three hits before you have to start from scratch. When you are navigating your way around bullets, smaller enemies, and pitfalls, while simultaneously trying to damage your primary target, toppling Cuphead's imposing bosses is both a monumental and rewarding task.But difficult battles only tell half of the story. Cuphead's 1930s cartoon aesthetic is endlessly charming, popping with color and expression unlike anything seen at this scale in a video game before. And now that it's available on Switch, you can get a closer look and admire the artwork in the palm of your hand. The sheer variety of characters and settings yields consistent delight as you go from one stage to the next, with everything bearing the telltale signs of grainy film and rudimentary production techniques. Cel-shading means one thing to a lot of people, but Cuphead truly re-creates the look of hand-drawn cel animation.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Cuphead Video ReviewThe characters and bosses that are clearly inspired by cartoon legends like Betty Boop break free from the expected to surprise you with something new. Never mind that Betty's lookalike is a mermaid now; it's the moment her head breaks free from her body and spews caustic skulls that gives you pause. If you can appreciate the unique animation style, you will be doubly impressed when you see what developer Studio MDHR has brought to the table. If its technical execution wasn't enough, MDHR's creativity puts Cuphead in a league of its own.A world map sets the stage for your adventure. As a Cup-thing who gambled with the devil, you now must go around collecting debts from the devil's other acquaintances--the game's bosses. Outside of one-on-one fights, you also have a few opportunities to run and gun through less-imposing platforming stages. These help break up the action and give you a chance to collect coins that can be cashed in for ""weapons"" and passive buffs. Coins are in short supply and can only be collected once, so farming to gain an advantage is out of the question. These stages don't compare to Cuphead's main attractions, but they add valuable substance nonetheless.The mix of ammunition for your handgun--character fire from their fingers--includes the likes of a spread shot, a charge blast, and a boomerang round. There are six in all, and each comes with a secondary attack that's tied to a meter that fills when you successfully land shots on enemies. You can also earn meter by parrying pink projectiles and enemies, a task that requires you to jump towards an enemy and then tap jump again at just the right moment before impact. These range from a fireball and a ring of damaging gems to a burst of bulky, short-range arrows. Finally, you have a super art, which can only be fired when your entire meter is full, as opposed to spending one section of that meter to fire your weapon's secondary attack. The one catch here is that when your meter is full, you can't perform a secondary attack--you are inconveniently forced to unleash your super art, which isn't always desirable.Given that you are able to equip two weapons at once, the variety of loadouts you can equip before a fight allows for flexibility on your part. While you may benefit by bringing a specific set of arms into some boss battles--say, using tracer rounds to pick off minor enemies swarming overhead--you can still carry whatever you wish into battle so long as you have the confidence and knowledge meet the challenge ahead.Learning the bosses' attack pattern is oftentimes half the battle, and it's typical to run through a fight multiple times until you see everything that might get thrown your way. Every boss fight consists of multiple stages or forms. Bosses will change shape, position, and behavior with each new phase. And within an individual phase, you may see as many as four different attacks, though you aren't always guaranteed to see them all during subsequent fights. When bosses begin to mix multiple attacks at once, the potential for various deadly combos keeps you on your toes no matter how familiar you are with the fight in question.The fear of the unexpected is part of what makes Cuphead such a thrilling game, beyond the frantic moment-to-moment tension. You only have three hit points per stage by default--you gain a fourth if you equip a charm that also weakens your firepower. But when the only question in your head is, ""In what order will the boss' attacks appear?"" fights take on less-appealing light after the dozenth attempt. It's in these moments you start to identify a few places where Cuphead could do a slightly better job of keeping you informed of your own progress and capabilities.You never can tell exactly how close to death--or a phase change, for that matter--bosses are. At best, you can see a plotline of the battle after death, to loosely gauge your relative progress. In the face of defeat, you may begin to question if you're carrying the right tools for the job. Beyond revisiting old fights, which is more arduous than it should be as you traverse the map slowly and can't fast travel, there isn't a great way to familiarize yourself with new weapons. And there's, unfortunately, no way to tell exactly how much damage one weapon does compared to another. Vague descriptions are all you get.If Cuphead's fights were indeed puzzles with one correct solution, this would be incredibly frustrating. As it stands, there's only a small amount of frustration to be found while fumbling with new weapons and dying in the process. It may sound like a minor thing to praise, but the fact that boss battles reload in one or two seconds is a godsend when it comes to trial-and-error tactics. And no matter how frustrating a boss may be, you can't escape the draw of their expressive animations.Cuphead does support two-player local co-op as well but it's pretty evident that this makes life more difficult for you and your partner. Despite the intricate chaos that you face alone in any given fight, when you add another character and more projectiles on screen, playing with a friend makes it far more difficult to discern your surroundings, and much easier to slip up. You do have a small window of time to revive a fallen comrade by parrying their ghost, but it's a mere few seconds while it floats up to the top of the screen before disappearing for the remainder of the fight.For anyone interested in getting a taste of Cuphead without facing almost-guaranteed defeat, there are simpler versions of every boss that you can fight--but you won't be able to access the final battle unless you beat every standard boss on the normal difficulty. And in reality, you may as well stick with the standard fights as Cuphead is relentless no matter how you play.Cuphead has been a longtime coming, and it's great to see that it lives up to its initial promises across all platforms. It's beautiful to look at, and with a pitch-perfect soundtrack, it flawlessly captures the era its developers so clearly revere. It's also an intense action game that pulls no punches. It could benefit from a few tweaks, and two-player co-op doesn't feel like the valuable addition you might imagine, but Cuphead remains a rare, unique game that truly stands out.Cuphead is featured on our list of the best Xbox co-op games as well as the Best Xbox Games for Kids.Editor's note (April 18, 2019): The review text and score have been updated to reflect the Switch version of Cuphead, which looks and plays just as well as other versions of the game--with a few new touches that will soon be applied to other platforms.

Polygon,"Filed under:Despite its reputation as a difficult game, Cuphead generously teaches players to become expertsCuphead has a reputation for being difficult, so let’s clarify this up top: Cuphead isn’t impossible; it isn’t the Dark Souls of 2D shooters, nor is it the world’s cutest bullet-hell game; it isn’t even particularly punishing. For a game that has established an identity around an “old-school” (read: hard) design, Cuphead is unexpectedly accessible. Announced in the summer of 2014, Cuphead cultivated a fandom around its art style, an homage to 1930s cartoons from Disney and Fleischer Studios. Brothers Chad and Jared Moldenhauer, along with animator Jake Clark, meshed the hand-drawn art with the run-and-gun genre popularized by pixelated games like Mega Man. The result is a throwback on a throwback, an ode to the good old days of games and animation alike.

  Shrewdly, the creators lanced many of the warts that have festered on the “good old days” of both forms. Gone are both the technical limitations of classic games and, more importantly, the grotesque racist caricature of classic cartoons. Cuphead’s creators have emulated how we remember our nostalgic darlings, rather than how they actually exist today.And that’s why I say Cuphead shouldn’t be missed because of preconceptions about difficulty (barring, perhaps, the finale, which I’ll get to shortly). It borrows ideas from games like Ikaruga and Gunstar Heroes, but it’s fine if you aren’t familiar with either of those. While it’s a game about battling overpowered enemies, Cuphead shares more with puzzle games, although it requires healthy reflexes, patience and, above all, a willingness to learn.Cuphead is the story of an adorable cup that makes a deal with the devil, then has to repay a debt by collecting the contracts of the devil’s other debtors. Satan’s debtors amount to a few dozen stand-alone boss fights, which must be completed so dear Cuphead can save his soul. You (and optionally, a friend in local co-op) travel from one boss to the next, unleashing infinite ammunition into their eyeballs, tummies, appendages or other vulnerable spots until they submit. All the while, you dodge increasingly complex patterns of attacks.The average boss fight in Cuphead, from beginning to end, is roughly two minutes long; short enough to be tested over and over and over again. Fights are themselves divided into a few phases, and each phase introduces its own new set of challenges (such as a tall wave of bullets) that inspire tiny epiphanies (rather than jump over the bullets, duck). Strung together to complete a stage, these self-taught lessons produce a real sense of accomplishment. It’s chemical. I do not fist-pump while playing games. I do not whoop. Cuphead had me doing both, while yelping “I did it!” to my very confused and indifferent dog.Cuphead, at its best, educates the player on how to overcome each obstacle. Every boss fight has an ideal strategy discovered through trial and error. To avoid stress, it’s helpful to think of failure as a greater tool than any weapon. When a Medusa-like boss froze me in midair, I eventually found the spot to hide from her icy stare. After a ghastly horseman uppercutted me into oblivion, I knew to keep an eye on the bottom of the screen so I could spot him preparing a strike. With each round against a boss, I found myself progressing further, not because I was becoming some prodigious video game guru, but because I merely spotted and memorized each stone on the walkway to victory.All of this is possible because of one crucial component: consistency.Parrying — hopping into attacks, then bouncing off them at the last moment — is a crucial and relatively forgiving mechanic in Cuphead, not requiring the superhuman timing of fighting games that feature a similar move. In some ways, I enjoyed the parrying system more than Cuphead’s various attacks. Only pink objects can be parried, and they change between levels, often blending into the scene. In one stage, they are dice skittering across a casino craps table; in another, they’re tears raining from a ghoulish pair of eyes. Finding the parry-able objects can become a game of recon, sending Cuphead into a fight not to win, but to spot the path to victory for a rematch. Tucked into the game are three mausoleum stages in which Cuphead can only extinguish ghosts with parries, sending the little goober bouncing across the screen, bopping one ghost after the other. It’s a lovely palate-cleanser, and I hope to see more of these missions in future expansions.The game isn’t designed for true gamers to race through with nothing but raw skill and unearned confidence. If anything, the boss fights punish pride, filling stages with minions, projectiles and traps. Where Cuphead scolds speed, it rewards a careful and thoughtful method. Anytime the challenge feels too great, a solution can typically be found by inhaling, exhaling and carefully considering all possible solutions before diving back into the fight.Cuphead unlocks new weapons and abilities rapidly, allowing for further experimentation in pursuit of the optimal way to beat any given boss. In a fight, Cuphead can carry two weapons, a bonus power and a special attack at all times. A thoughtful loadout can impact the difficulty of a stage. For example, a stage with swarms of enemies benefits from a powerful short-range attack, a buff that automatically accumulates special attacks and a screen-clearing super move. Meanwhile, a humongous boss who fires large projectiles calls for homing bullets, a buff that prevents damage while dodging and a special move that grants brief invincibility.Loadout weapons and buffs can purchased with coins hidden throughout a handful of platforming stages. To be clear, Cuphead isn’t a platformer. A few side-scrolling moments have been added for flavor, but where boss fights teach players the unique method with which to clear each fight, these traditional stages are largely completed through brute force, killing everything on screen, pressing forward until the finish line. Classic video game boss fights have fallen out of favor in the past couple of decades, and one wonders if these bits of platforming were added to ground intimidated players in something more familiar. Sadly, there’s no better reminder of why video games have largely scrapped the classic boss fight than the final two battles in Cuphead. The first is a gauntlet of bosses, between three and nine, along with a bonus boss. And the final ... well, I won’t go into details, but it felt like a battle with the game itself. Cuphead has an astonishing cohesion: a stunning orchestral soundtrack and visual confidence that reminds me of my favorite Ub Iwerks cartoons. But on occasion, those elements get in the way — particularly the art, which can obscure the foreground, concealing enemies and projectiles. Sometimes the part of an enemy that can be touched without taking damage is unclear. The final fights combine both of these problems, and what should feel like a culmination of a learned expertise winds up requiring a mastery of the game’s idiosyncrasies — with help from luck. The conclusion of Cuphead is, I fear, what the game has broadly been perceived as: a comically difficult, if not cruel, experience. And that’s really a shame, because the lion’s share of Cuphead is a special formula that takes a notoriously challenging genre of the past and carefully and lovingly introduces it to the wider audience it deserves.

  Cuphead’s deal with the devil eventually leads to hell, and so perhaps it’s fitting the conclusion should be so torturous. Though, honestly, even the residual headache has been soothed by the sweet, sweet salve of victory. When I think of my time with Cuphead, instead of frustration I’ll remember the dozens of tiny breakthroughs, when the impossible became possible, and a game that built an identity around difficulty helped me to feel, however briefly, undefeatable. Cuphead was reviewed using a final “retail” downloadable Xbox Play Anywhere code provided by Microsoft, and the game was played exclusively on a Windows 10 PC.

Take one look at the game in motion, and you’ll see why. Cuphead combines brutal, precision platforming action with an exceptionally well realized artistic style to create one of the most enjoyable video game experiences I’ve ever had.Cuphead is an action-platformer in the style of games like Gunstar Heroes. Your basic abilities will have you running, shooting, and dashing around to dodge projectiles and enemies while damaging foes. Most of the game’s levels are static boss fights. These fights, when done correctly, are short and typically range from 90 seconds to three minutes. The key phrase here is “done correctly,” because the fun of Cuphead comes from its punishing difficulty.Rather than upgrading your character with loot and deep skill trees, getting good at Cuphead is all about mastering the relatively simple controls. The most “technical” the game gets is when it comes to its unique parry system. Any pink object in the world, from enemies, to projectiles, to the nose on a vicious roller coaster, can be parried, or double-jumped off of, in other words--keeping you safe and adding a bar to your super meter. It’s a system that is easy to learn and helpful for beating bosses more quickly early on, and becomes vital for survival in later levels of the game.In addition to standard pea shooter, Cuphead also has five weapons, that can be unlocked by collecting currency. Each of the weapons has their own advantages and disadvantages, and any two can be brought into each level and swapped with the push of a button. These weapons include a homing shot that deals reduced damage, a spread shot with short range, and my personal favorite a charge shot in the style of Mega Man. You can also equip one passive charm, which can give you abilities like a gradually increasing super meter or an invincible and invisible dash.Where Cuphead truly sets itself apart from other similar games is in its art style. Cuphead looks, sounds like, and most importantly feels like you’re playing a 1930s American cartoon, specifically in the style of early Disney. The titular character, as well as his accomplice Mugman, even both resemble Mickey Mouse himself.That’s not to say that the game is just a cheap rip-off, though. Each of the bosses feels truly inspired. The very first boss is a prime example of what to expect. At first, Goopy LeGrande is just a villainous slime whose only form of attack is to jump on you or form into a fist and lunge at you. He grows angry, and halfway through the battle takes a pill that makes him larger. He’s faster, bigger, and more dangerous. After dealing with this second form, the slime “dies,” and his third and final form--the giant vengeful tombstone of Goopy LeGrande--drops on the field and attempts to crush Cuphead, because that’s all he ever knew in life. Every boss almost tells a story just through its transformations. I’m still blown away when I see footage of all the bosses, even the most frustrating ones who were responsible for dozens of my deaths and hours of gameplay wasted.These fixed-perspective boss fights make up a little more than half the game. The other playable levels of Cuphead are airborne shooters and “run-and-gun” levels. The plane battles play like boss fights from shoot-em-ups, using the same basic controls (parrying, super moves) of the platforming levels, but instead of swapping to a second weapon you can turn into a more mobile mini-plane. These levels can be some of the most difficult in the game, as the focus is much more on precise movement than usual. Run-and-gun levels play like the boss fights, but with a focus on dealing with smaller enemies and platforming. They feel like they could be longer, but are so dense with amazing art and enemy design that I had fun replaying them multiple times just to improve my rank.Despite its inviting art style, Cuphead is not a game for everyone. It’s extremely difficult, and you might not think that the definition of fun is playing the same levels over and over again. There is also one major issue in the parry system. People with certain types of colorblindness may not be able to know at first glance which items are pink and can be parried. There are boss fights where it is almost mandatory that you do some parrying, and the fact that there is no colorblind mode may make it difficult for these people to beat the game. It feels like most video games have implemented colorblind modes, even when it is not imperative, so the lack of one in Cuphead stands out.If you’re the type of person who derives joy from angrily banging your head into a boss over and over until you can perfectly defeat it in the most glorious 90 seconds you will ever experience, then Cuphead is the total package. The tight gameplay, accompanied by an incredibly well-realized aesthetic, makes for a truly unforgettable gameplay experience. © 2023 FANDOM, INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

CUPHEAD REVIEW FOR PS4. Cuphead might have been left on the stove for quite some time after its surprise E3 2014 appearance, but it came out at the perfect temperature when it finally released in 2017. The difficult bosses were satisfying to topple and the 1930s-esque art style never wore out its welcome. And after its venture to the Switch, it has finally made its way to the PS4, despite Studio MDHR adamantly stating the opposite a few years ago. The Cuphead PS4 version isn’t a grand new repackaging of the tough platformer, but is a faithful representation of it.Cuphead‘s gameplay and presentation — its two core tenets — are essentially untouched, but didn’t need any sort of upgrades in that department. Its Fleischer-inpsired art is built to withstand the test of time as it still looks fantastic almost a century later. Cuphead is obviously more colorful than those cartoons and has some of the most exaggerated and expressive animation when compared to its 2D peers.Enemies are both wondrously creative and impeccably drawn and haven’t lost a bit of their charm since the game’s initial release. Even though some have tried (and failed), there was nothing like it then and there’s still nothing like it now as it remains an inventive mix of old animation and pure ingenuity. Foes bounce from one unexpected form to the next to maintain a healthy sense of visual and gameplay unpredictability — a facet that is further emphasized by the random patterns of many bosses. Pattern recognition can best a few of the big bads, but plenty of them change up their tactics each time and require that you master the mechanics and not absentmindedly fall into mundane grooves.Cuphead is mainly made up of these boss rush stages where your only objective is to defeat that one giant enemy in front of you. Projectiles often fill the screen as you carefully weave through them to land blows of your own. Each takes a fair bit of skill and concentration to fell and many of them will make quick work of your porcelain ass if your finger twitches incorrectly or your mind wanders for a brief second. But the smooth and responsive controls mean that you’ll never get to blame the game, just your poor reflexes.Quickly loading back in keeps frustration at a low and when combined with the fluid mechanics, Cuphead is a hard game and a hard game to put down especially as the catchy soundtrack wonderfully matches and heightens the game’s frenetic pace. Dodging through bullet-filled screens that would make Ikaruga blush is mentally taxing though, meaning that you’re more likely to stop playing out of exhaustion than out of rage. Hitting such a nexus of fair and challenging is admirable and one of the key reasons Cuphead doesn’t grow stale and remains immensely gratifying throughout. It pushes you to work harder and rewards you intrinsically for coming out on top.Cuphead isn’t stale even though it is identical to its predecessors. There’s no new content and the game still doesn’t support any sort of crossplay or online multiplayer. It’s a mere port with the faster load times of the patched Xbox One original that still outshine the Switch installment (although every platform outperforms the game’s 2017 launch load times). While that Switch installment was portable and an impressive translation, the newer PS4 counterpart doesn’t have anything to add since it is just another way to play the game.While another extras-focused update is planned (however, it’s unclear if it is coming to non-Xbox platforms), it would have been ideal if this launch fixed some of the game’s small but persistent issues. The run-and-gun levels do change up the pacing, but are still underwhelming as they feel like mods that put the mechanics in situations they aren’t as equipped to handle. More flexible aiming would also help both the run-and-gun and regular boss levels as being locked to specific angles can be frustrating. And even though its difficulty is part of the charm, it still lacks decent accessibility options. None of these problems rob Cuphead of its prestige status, but addressing these would benefit every version and better welcome in this new port.Cuphead is likely to be an unforgettable experience no matter what is played on. There’s a fundamental charm to the game that still remains unique as it goes from platform to platform. Its boss fights and art style are consistent highlights and almost completely override some of its minute inconsistencies that are still present here. The Cuphead PS4 port may not bring anything new to the table, but it’s still the prettiest chalice on it.GameRevolution reviewed Cuphead on PS4.

Destructoid,"darkBeating Cuphead should come with a complimentary Mensa membership. It’s a tough game, but Cuphead‘s difficulty lies more in exhaustive pattern recognition than anywhere else. Reactive shooting and jumping only go so far. Eventually, it’s hardly reactionary anymore; it’s muscle memory at that point.There’s a cognitive brilliance about Cuphead that makes it more rewarding than most other platformer shooters. There’s a process to every single fight: Introduction, dissection, analysis, execution. Liberally sprinkle in failure at each step. No one is going to stumble into success in Cuphead. Every victory is earned. Every victory is sweet.Cuphead (PC [reviewed], Xbox One)Developer: StudioMDHR EntertainmentPublisher: StudioMDHR EntertainmentReleased: September 29, 2017MSRP: $19.99Cuphead tells the story of the eponymous protagonist who’s up to his straw in gambling debts. Making matters worse: The devil is the bookie. The only way out of this is for Cuphead to act as an aggressive collection agency, fighting everyone else who owes the devil money until they pay up.The structure of Cuphead is such that it rarely wastes time on lesser encounters. Most games would focus on how and where we find these bums; Cuphead foregoes the hunt in favor of delivering us right to these deadbeats. Essentially, it’s a series of boss encounters — each and every one legitimately different and special and memorable. The sentient teacup is eventually and inevitably outshone by the likes of a gigantic flower, an evil carnival ride, and a feisty Broadway actress.Thematically, Cuphead is all over the place. There’s a cohesion in the stunning 1930s-era aesthetic (and the accompanying jazz soundtrack which is similarly fabulous) but most of the enemies don’t have much in common with each other. That’s okay, though! They’re consistently presented as independent challenges and besting any one of them feels like an event. They don’t necessarily need to be linked except by virtue of the fact that they’re all debtors.Actually, the game probably benefits from this variation. It affords Cuphead an opportunity of sorts, the chance to get wildly imaginative in whatever way it possibly can. This potential is made good on time and time again in the multi-stage battles. Each boss becomes more and more intimidating as time goes on — not only by their more-powerful tactics, but also by their physical transformations. There’s a progression to each fight that’s equal parts logical and beautiful.There’s an easy-to-ignore animation after every failed attempt that eventually comes to define the Cuphead experience. It’s a silhouetted bar that indicates how close to the end you came. Rarely will a dedicated player find themselves backtracking on that bar in subsequent tries. Every section is a hurdle of randomized patterns, and that hurdle will only be cleared through understanding and learning. Once you finally make a breakthrough, it’s suddenly not tough to replicate that success.The key, at least at first, is to understand your own abilities before understanding what the enemies are capable of. It’s obfuscated to some extent, but the dash and parry maneuvers are just as important as the shooting. Cuphead has deceptively tight platforming mechanics, something that’s not likely to be noticed until you angle through a particularly hazardous spot. It feels more natural than it looks.This is a necessity because Cuphead‘s reliance on platforming is greater than it seems. For all the colorful bullet-hell shooting that happens, there’s constant jumping and dodging that’s even more important. It’s an unending offensive barrage, sure, but its backbone is keen defensive play. Yin and yang.Supplementing all of this is a glut of skills to choose from. I’m hesitant to call them upgrades because they really aren’t. They’re mostly just different from one another and some even come with drawbacks. For instance, one shot type is long distance and low damage, while another is medium range with good damage but a lowered fire rate; the charms — which are more passive abilities — have options like an extra life at the cost of decreased damage, or an automatic parry after a jump. (Parries are particularly important. Executing one on a pink enemy substantially fills the meter for Ex and Super attacks.)It’s a lot to keep track of, which perfectly mirrors how every battle has a lot to keep track of. There are so many actions on the screen at all times, and it can be overwhelming. Everything makes sense though. All enemy attacks are telegraphed in some way. You just have to know what to look out for. Easier said than done, especially when you’re staying cautious of, like, three different attacks. Cuphead‘s always fair, though. Tough but fair.Armed with that knowledge, going on the offensive is less about brute force and more about strategic movement. It’s easy to hit the opponent. It’s harder to hit them from a place where you’re not at risk. This is theoretically possible from most anywhere. Cuphead has an eight-direction firing radius, and it’s the weakest system in the game. Locked down with a button hold, it’s included for shooting in any direction. However, it’s always clunky and awkward. Attacks like the split shot spread out to cover several directions at once, and that feels like a better way to approach complicated situations.The likely reason that there isn’t 360-degree aiming is probably because Cuphead was designed without the controller’s right stick in mind. The default bindings are confounding and ridiculous. Jump, attack, and dash are all set to face buttons, making it unnecessarily prohibitive to do all three in quick succession. (Keep in mind that your finger will hold down the attack button a great majority of the time.) To circumvent this, I assigned dash to the right trigger, freeing my right thumb to only worry about attack and jump. Admittedly, these quibbles are mostly just minor inconveniences.Cuphead‘s incredible style belies its magical complexity. It’s so much more than a hard-as-hell shoot-’em-up with artistic flair. It’s cerebral in a way that these kind of games rarely are. Cuphead‘s commitment to forcing the player to understand is commendable. Those who don’t have the patience to learn won’t get far. That’s the kind of stand-your-ground moxie that makes this a hallmark of game design. My praise runneth over.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]SuperbA hallmark of excellence. There may be flaws, but they are negligible and won't cause massive damage.

CUPHEAD became an instant classic when it debuted a year and a half ago for the Xbox One and PC. Studio MDHR’s shoot ’em up romp looked impressive since its unveiling, but playing the final product proved that it had substance to back up its visuals. The team had seamlessly blended the style of 1930s cartoons with hardcore run-and-gun tactics in a way that was truly mesmerizing. The surprise announcement of the Cuphead Switch version made it easy to be skeptical but it’s a fantastic port that has made the transition with its best features intact.In Cuphead, you portray the titular character — or his chummy pal, Mugman — as they make their way to the Devil’s casino. Lucifer makes them an offer they can’t refuse with an attempt to double their money. However, it backfires and leaves the duo helplessly in his debt. Fortunately, he makes them a last-second deal: hunt down debtors that owe him big time, and he’ll spare them. And thus begins a boss-laden journey filled with some rather imaginative battles.Among these include a fight with a large blue Slime-like being that has a knack for wearing a boxing glove; a trio of farm vegetables that don’t give up easily; an actress that sees her whole life pretty much played out on stage as she attempts to kill you, and more. And this is just a handful of the nearly 20 or so creative boss battles that await, each tougher than the last until the challenging finale.But they’re not impossible and overcoming that hump is why they’re so satisfying to slay. Like retro games, there’s a pattern to figure out. Not only that, but pink objects appear in the environment, giving the duo a chance to melee jump off of them and get some extra height and power up their special moves. Along the way, you can also acquire different types of projects including a Contra-esque spread gun, homing bullets, and more as well as useful health boosters.Those bosses are fun to fight as well. Cuphead feels like a classic run-and-gun, so fans of Contra and Gunstar Heroes will be right at home. The action never lets up, and the controls are accurate, even giving you the option to aim in some spots just in case you need to shoot someone above you. It’s smooth, quick, and always does what you want. Dying is frequent but it will probably always be your fault.That said, there should be more run-and-gun levels. There are only three, as the rest of the game dedicated to boss battles. Future DLC might add more of these stages but it was likely that these were difficult to make, which would explain their sparsity. Its boss battles do hold up the game nicely but these traditional levels feel like a full-blown tribute to the good ol’ days that the game could use more of.Its incredible gameplay is matched by its impressive presentation. The graphics pop to life like a wondrous cartoon out of the Steamboat Willie era, its cavalcade of bosses look like they’re just as lively as the main characters, and the backgrounds deliver a sense of wonder unlike anything we’ve ever seen before in the medium. This is easily one of the most imaginatively designed games out there, and it shows in every single frame all the way up to its ending. Cutscenes are even animated now, meaning that it looks better than it did when it came out on the Xbox One and PC.The music also holds up its end of the presentation package. It’s a full-blown orchestration of classic ‘30s themes, and matches the tone of the game splendidly. Each one is catered to particular boss battles. For instance, a dangerous flower is backed by a catchy jazz score, while a pair of boxing frogs get something that revs up as the battle continues on the inside of a club just for bees.Everything about the presentation holds up nicely on the Switch. Even in handheld mode, it looks like fantastic, with nary a hint of slowdown. It’s an impressive feat and a testament to how great art doesn’t always need to run on powerful machines to look great.Cuphead also has a unique New Game Plus mode that’s worth trying to get. Score an A rating or better on each stage and you get that much closer to unlocking a hardcore black and white mode. Skilled players will definitely want to dig in and go after this mode since it matches the game’s aesthetic without compromising it. Everyone else may want to get a hang of the game first, but this mode is novel enough and a goal to strive for.Studio MDHR put together something great when the original Cuphead first released by making a tight platformer shooter with a unique sense of style. Its hardcore shooting, combined with precision controls and outstanding presentation, are still noteworthy today and will likely age well. Rookies may run into frustrations at first, but they can always take the Simple route and get the hang of everything before jumping in to deeper waters.Not only that, but the couch co-op support is spot-on as well, despite the slightly disappointing exclusion of online co-op. A second player can jump in and help out with the battle at any time. And the game is surprisingly playable in portable mode with a Joy-Con – though the Pro Controller is better because of its superior buttons.Everything about Cuphead just feels right, even all these months after its original release. As it stands right now, this game is nearly flawless in its own right, thanks to its responsive controls and signature style. That doesn’t mean it’s going to be for everyone, especially those who don’t want to or can’t get over its sometimes oppressive difficulty. But those who are determined to get through Cuphead will see that it simply spills over with joy.GameRevolution reviewed Cuphead on Nintendo Switch with a code provided by the publisher.10Share article"
