Link Official siteDifferent as they are, Supergiant's previous games—Pyre, Transistor, and Bastion—have all been summed up the same way. Story, art, music, voice-acting, atmosphere? A+. Combat? Kind of B-. Hades feels like a response to that, a Supergiant game that focuses on the fighting and elevates it to the absolute top-tier. This isn't a spoiler because you've looked at the score, but they nailed it. The combat's fantastic.Hades doesn't short us on the other stuff either, though it easily could have. It's a roguelike, or a roguelite, or an action-RPG with permadeath. Whatever you call it, it's a genre where story is secondary, either hidden away in the lore encyclopedia or otherwise in the back seat—the back seat of one of those cars with a window separating it from the driver.Not so in Hades, where every character is fully voiced and has more to say with every run. You're Zagreus, son of the death god, prince of the underworld. You believe the whole ""ruling in Hell"" thing is overrated, so with the help of your distant Olympian family you're going to fight through every shade, fury, and other mythic monster between you and the surface to escape. Because fuck you, Dad, that's why.The best Greek myths are about gods and heroes, and when ordinary mortals are involved they boil down to fairytale morals about how you should obey your weird husband no matter what because he might turn out to be the West Wind. Hades knows this, and focuses on legendary characters like Athena and Achilles, painting them in broad archetypal strokes. My favorite's Dionysus, god of wine, hedonism, and everybody just being like really cool, but everyone from long-suffering fury Megaera to layabout Sisyphus is brought to life, with a solid vocal portrayal and art like they stepped out of a Mike Mignola comic.Where other games hand out story as a reward for success, Hades uses it to reward failure. With each death Zagreus is sent back to the House of Hades where his father judges souls and legends gather. Doing a circuit of the court to see what new things they have to say (and give Cerberus a pat), lets you wind down and take a breath after your latest death has left your hands shaking. When I die in Dead Cells I want to quit, but in Hades the sting's immediately removed because I get to chat with an embodiment of night and see what's up with Orpheus. Then, back in the zone, I buy another round of upgrades and try again.At the start of each run you pick a legendary weapon, like the Aegis shield, accept a boon, like the one from Dionysus that adds hangover damage (read ""poison"") to your attacks, and enter the first of the underworld's three realms. They're made up of randomized chambers where a set number of enemies spawn, you vanquish them, collect a reward, and enter the next chamber.Every weapon's agreeably unique. Hold down attack with the shield and you'll block, then bull-rush forward. Its special lets you bounce it off enemies then catch it like Hellenic Captain America. The spear can also be thrown and recalled, but only comes back when commanded, letting you reposition first and line up new shades to skewer, while its hold-down attack is an area-of-effect spin. Then there's the Adamant Rail, which is literally a gun, complete with grenade launcher attachment.In addition you've got a ranged attack called a cast and can unlock a call, an ultimate granted by whichever god you've got favor with that's earned by filling up a god gauge. I often forget about the call because that gauge doesn't stand out beneath the attention-grabbing red health bar, though sometimes a text pop-up will remind me (probably because the game knows I rarely use the thing). The real star in your arsenal is a dash that can take you through enemies and objects, and combines with attacks for a dash-strike. Whoever's responsible for the timing and animation should pat themselves on the back, because dashing feels great, whether used to backstab a skeleton, or to warp through a column just as the minotaur charges so he slams his cowlick into a big lump of marble instead of me.Mobility's essential, not just to avoid attacks but to set up wall slams for bonus damage, trigger traps then dash out of the blast zone, and knock down support columns to bring down chunks of masonry. Getting into a rhythm, launching a combo then zooming around the battlefield like I've got wings on my sandals, puts me in such a focused flow-state I don't notice the soundtrack accentuating the action. If a game can distract me from Darren Korb rocking out then it's doing everything right.What Hades' combat reminds me of is Bastion's dream challenges, especially when played with oddball late-game weapon combinations. Bastion's combat was seen as its weak spot, but my hot take about a game from 2011 is that the fighting ruled actually, and Hades feels like an evolution of it—only invoking gods in Hades gives blessings instead of curses and upgrades can be bought mid-run as well as back at your hub.I should talk about the upgrades, yeah? Gold coins, obols from the eyes of the dead, can be spent at Charon's shop when it pops up in a chamber for temporary buffs and heals, while shards of darkness can be spent in the House of Hades for permanent upgrades, like backstab damage or the ability to defy death and come back at half-health when you'd otherwise fall. Gems buy renovations for the hub but also for the underworld, adding rooms with healing pools or urns that can be smashed for obols.I haven't even mentioned the diamonds, titan blood, and other currencies later in the game. It may sound like a bit much, but it's handed out at an even pace, and the steady improvements feel balanced to my own improvement as I play. Shortly after I got used to working cast attacks into my dash-reliant tactics, I bought an upgrade for more damage to anyone I've used my cast on. There's a parity between its rewards and my own skills, both pushing me further. It's the most I've been engaged with a roguelike's upgrade tree since Rogue Legacy.That's half of what keeps me coming back to Hades, and the other half is the unfolding story of Zagreus. He could easily have been the worst flavor of videogame protagonist, an angry buff princeling smoldering with generic rage. Instead it's his father Hades, a goth beefcake Santa who spends all day shouting at paperwork and moaning about his underlings, who fills that role. Zagreus is likeable, with a wry sense of humor, and when Hades sarcastically asks how the latest attempt at trashing the realm goes he replies, ""My ransacking was a delight, thanks for asking."" The prince also just seems like a decent person, listening to shades when they talk about how they died, appreciating the house servant who is also a severed gorgon head, and taking note of who the employee of the day is while saying, hey, good for you, Achilles.Sure, I want every run to end in victory, but I also want to buy that music stand for the throne room, unlock all the keepsakes, and see how this romantic subplot plays out. Like Orpheus I look back, only unlike him I'm happy to keep repeating this cycle.Action so intense it'll leave you jittery and hopped-up on adrenaline, and characters to die for.Jody's first computer was a Commodore 64, so he remembers having to use a code wheel to play Pool of Radiance.

Eurogamer,"God tier.I love what Hades is made of. It's made of mythology, of course - Zeus and Nyx and all that other spontaneous, terrifying, pitiable lot who have been lurking in their own form of Early Access for millenia. And it's made of everything the developer Supergiant has learned from making dashing, finely poised action games like Bastion and Transistor - and storied, wilful, luminous oddities like Pyre. 
But it's also made of stone so smoothly polished it reads like glass or water. It's made of lap pools of blood, of palm columns shot through with arteries of twinkling jewels. Even when you're pushing a raft across lava there's a sense that the rocks around you are just so, that they melt and ooze because artists have thought about their insides, and are in love, above all else, with texture. After every run of Zagreus' attempts to escape the underworld, he returns to a house that is positively lurid with texture and sharp edges and glimmer. The famed gods live in a sort of McMansion, or a Las Vegas hotel's Presidential Suite, bad taste spared absolutely no expense. Of course they live somewhere like this. Maybe life and death is just one big casino. Maybe these gods play dice and then hit the slots.Most of this textured stuff is designed to shatter. Hades is a Roguelite brawler, so each run is a run into hell and, hopefully, out the other side, and in between failures you spend earnings on new abilities and unlocks. But brawler is too padded and fleshy and imprecise a word, the clumsy heel of a palm, the stub of a haphazard elbow. During the run, during the failures, you are a wrecking ball with the focus of a laser, taking down pillars, slamming things into walls, blasting stone and crystal into shrapnel clouds of thick, gritty air. Supergiant chose Zagreus as a protagonist because he is a bit of a pencil shadow in the mythological texts - hazy shape and no real substance, a whisper of graphite. The writing team styles him as the kind of irresistibly arch Ivy League hardnut that Donna Tartt writes about so well, bruised cheekbones and dewy forehead, lip a dissolute twist just waiting to attain its precarious hold on a Gauloise. He is charismatic and chancy, refined without being remotely delicate. But then the game's action comes along and turns him into the part of every episode of The Property Brothers where teardown kicks in - mallet meets plasterboard and the sky is busy with splintered timber. The kitchen becomes a crater in seconds. The violence is backed by the unflinching heft of metal. What a complicated fellow.None of the rest of the game would matter if it wasn't fun to hit things. And on this topic, I've sometimes worried that Supergiant, a developer blessed and cursed with rare taste, is going to end up a victim of that taste, turning out theoretically exquisite mechanisms that chime a little hollow. I've worried that the team's output will even gloss away into mere brute luxury - Lambos or Swarovski swans. I'm wrong so far! What's surprising about Hades, to me at least, is how gutsy it is, how vitally in love with connection it is. It lives to clobber. Room after room of hell. You turn up and wait for horrors. The horrors arrive and, jeepers, you shred them. You pulverise them. I have never felt so sorry for the stuff of nightmares.Combat is based on a main attack and a special, along with a dodge and a cast, which means you lob a glossy gem into a baddy and it does them ill, but then lodges there, annoyingly, for longer than you might want it to. Beyond that it's based on weapon choices that define how attacks and specials play out. Arrows and flinging shields are my favourite options to pick between at the moment - Hawkeye's fine, but it's great to be Captain America. Beyond that, though, or rather deep down and underneath it all - I was moving in the wrong direction with those 'beyonds' and now I can't fix it - it's about this feeling the game has. And it's the same feeling you get from the Vegas hotel landscape of the early areas, even when you're gadding through the heather of Elysium - you sock-slide and grip suddenly, smooth and swift and then THWACK. Everything is a spin on this feeling: coasting on air, and then colliding. The darting hummingbird and the copper-bottomed saucepan.The things you're smacking around are wonderful. Even early on you can expect bloated ghosts with huge bellies, flesh stained the sunset colours of Florida cocktails, nasty little all-legged things with sacks of horrors on their backs. Later how about a massive snake of bones, a deadly library book stamp, bullet-hell witches and a field filled with butterfly spewing gumballs? Bosses are great and draw from the classics, but I particularly love a cluster of gems from the very first rooms that bobbles around before striking you from afar. It is so hard to be personally aggrieved by jewelry, but Hades manages to get you there. It makes glittering stone something you can hate with woozy passion.These things come at you in waves, in procedurally scrambled rooms that have their own deadly doodads. In the first areas, you generally only have to worry about spike pits or turrets with trigger pads, so I leaned rather heavily on that dash. But then the second area throws lava everywhere, so overzealous dashing generally ends in unintentional barbecue. Onwards and upwards - risk and reward, risk and reward. And then...?You choose which rooms to travel through from a handful of doors that appear when you clear out all the baddies. Generally you're picking between what kind of pay-off you want once the next battle is done. The old gods were so baldly transactional. More health? One of a handful of in-game currencies for levelling up over time? Or a chance to get a gift from the squabbling cast of ancients?This might be one of my favourite things about Hades. Over many runs you get stronger and last longer and get different weapons to try out. Fine. But each individual run is shaped by the gods you meet and the things you choose when they offer you a handful of their themed perks to pick from. Like the contents of the shopkeeper's store in Spelunky, this stuff can really mix things up and define an adventure. And the choices are often almost impossible. A dash that poisons or an attack that poisons? More doom or a brand new special? Do I want the people I have already killed, right, to make living enemies sick?The gods who deliver this stuff are wonderfully charming and untrustworthy and vain and drunken - the underworld is a Bluth Company construct, right down to the McMansion you all live in - but what really clicks for me is the way that this procedural game allows you to procedurally clip together your own Zagreus each time, and each time it's bittersweet because you know things won't fall together in quite this way ever again. It's sad in Spelunky when I don't get the jetpack, but for one glorious ten minute spell in Hades I had a shield that bounced around between enemies for a hilariously long time and left electricity in its clattering wake. I could chuck my shield, do the school run and return in time to catch it in the middle of a room in which everyone but me had been fatally pummelled in my absence. Meanwhile my dash spawned dark little infernal whirlpools that dragged enemies in for extra damage. Haven't Lego-bricked that one together again since.When it's done it's back to Dad's house to mope into the bedroom, spend a few upgrade points, chat to the relatives and then head out once more. Hell is a loop. Of course it is. But each circuit fills out the characters and deepens the connections until I have started to warm to Zagreus, for all his poise and chill.All of which is to say: Hades is a proper lark. I love it. But there is something else here, something that I have always felt about games but never been able to put into words. There is something about polished, smartly conceived Hades, about so many of Supergiant's games which, the joyous brilliance of Pyre aside perhaps, are always too rigorous, too responsibly conceived not to know exactly what spot they're going to fit into on the shelf, which pillars they're going to present to the press - there is something about these games that are so assuredly products that reminds me that games are never ever just products. Games are always a way of being. To play Hades, Roguelite aside, economy aside, loop aside, is to be furious and vengeful, to be driven by bitterness, self-hate, ennui, to be pulverisingly powerful and yet horribly efficient. This is the truth of it down to the controls, which encourage you to grip the pad by the facebuttons and squeeze and squeeze and squeeze like you're one stress ball away from telling your boss to shove it.This game comes from Hell, and it takes you back there, and it's brilliant. Get in.

Metro GameCentral,"The creators of Bastion and Transistor present a roguelike based on Greek mythology, but Hades is far more innovative than that sounds…If you were to ask someone 10 years ago to describe a stereotypical indie game, they’d probably say a 2D platformer that looks like a NES game. There’s a still a fair number of those about but the more prevalent cliché nowadays is punishingly difficult roguelikes with randomly generated dungeons. That describes Hades to a tee but that shouldn’t be a taken as a negative, after all it’s not as if the gaming world is short of online shooters or open world games. True originality is rare, but a game of Hades’ quality is also far from commonplace.What might raise an additional eyebrow though is that Hades follows a very similar style of combat and presentation to developer Supergiant’s previous games Bastion and Transistor. The differences are more profound than they first seem, but this is yet another of their titles that uses a very zoomed-out isometric viewpoint and relies on unusually garrulous characters to provide much of its atmosphere.The set-up here is more straightforward than Supergiant’s previous games, since the plot of the game can be summarised simply as ‘Zagreus, son of Hades, wants to escape from the underworld’. At first things really are as simple as that sounds, with Zagreus portrayed as a sort of friendlier version of old school Kratos and able to carve a significant swathe through his father’s forces before inevitably dying and… going back to try again.Every time Zagreus succumbs he returns to the game’s starting point, where his father and his underlings work away, relatively unconcerned at his exploits. Once you venture out again the layout of the dungeons completely resets and you lose all your items, although like most modern roguelikes you do get to keep your in-game currency as well as your current relationship with all the various gods and monsters you’ve met along the way – which in turn can grant you other permanent items and aids.Not only is the use of Greek mythology reminiscent of God Of War but so too is the combat, in that it’s not quite as complex as Devil May Cry and Bayonetta but certainly more involved than your average light and heavy attack button-masher. The similarities end there though and while Zagreus has access to a wide range of different weapons, special moves, and ranged attacks, the skill of using them is only half the challenge compared to deciding which abilities you actually take into battle.You quickly build up a wide variety of different moves and buffs, that at first you’ll just pick and choose largely at random, before subsequent runs reveal how they can all work together to make you considerably more powerful than with a less optimised set-up. Whether you want to emphasise speed, defence, attack, or the use of a particular weapon depends on both your natural playstyle and which boss character you’re currently having trouble with, but rarely has a loadout mattered so much outside of a hardcore role-playing game.What makes acquiring new items especially interesting though is that most are portrayed as boons from the gods and so which you take with you affects your relationship with your would-be peers and can open up otherwise hidden side quests. Each god offers a different style of benefit but you can’t have them all, which often ends up offending whoever’s help you decline – which can cause a lot of trouble when it ends up being used against you.(The game’s use of Greek myths is excellent throughout and far more interesting than the simplistic clichés found in most other games, as Hades captures not only the petty callousness of the ancient gods but also their very human motivations.)The most unexpected pleasure that Hades offers is that you begin to measure progress not just in literal terms, as you get closer and closer to escaping to the mortal world, but how much of the plot you’ve unravelled. Returning to Hades’ realm each time you die not only gives you the chance to talk to your dad again but also a range of other characters of varying degrees of helpfulness.A roguelike with a proper story is almost unheard of and while Hades doesn’t have a clear-cut ending, with plot revelations and character arcs continuing on into the end game, the narrative becomes just as much of a motivation for continued play as improving your combat skills. The dialogue is good throughout and, as ever for Supergiant, the voiceovers are excellent.I beat Spider-Man 2 in 14 hours and I want my money back - Reader’s FeatureOnly 1% of Netflix users are taking advantage of a free little-known perkAlan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepAs with any game that relies on randomly generated maps you can’t help but imagine that it would’ve been even better if more of it was handcrafted, especially as a lot of the chambers in Hades look rather samey as it is. We also found the art design on a lot of the enemies to be disappointingly unimaginative – they’re fine but lack the same spark of inventiveness that underlines the rest of the game.It also has to be said that this is not something that’s very well suited to playing in handheld mode, as the graphics already seem small on a TV and the action can be difficult to read on just the Switch’s small screen. That aside this is one of the most forward-thinking roguelikes of recent years, that not only gets the meat and potatoes of combat and exploration right but, with the interwoven narrative, adds a new ingredient you never would’ve imagined would work so well.Hades may not seem particularly remarkable at first glance, but its quiet innovation is one of the best surprises of the year and while technically it is yet another indie roguelike it’s one of the best of the generation.In Short: A hell of a good roguelike, supported by a surprisingly strong narrative that provides just as much motivation to persevere as the excellent combat system.Pros: Well-conceived combat that encourages experimentation via an impressive array of weapons, abilities, and buffs. Great storytelling with especially good voiceovers. Huge amount of content.Cons: The enemy design can be a bit unimaginative at times and the small characters can be difficult to make out in handheld mode. More hand-crafted stages would’ve been nice.Score: 8/10Formats: Nintendo Switch (reviewed) and PCPrice: £22.49Publisher: Supergiant GamesDeveloper: Supergiant GamesRelease Date: 17th September 2020Age Rating: 12Email gamecentral@metro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter.

Game Informer,"Developer Supergiant Games is known for creating titles with rich narratives and sophisticated themes, and one of the great triumphs of Hades is how those elements are seamlessly integrated into a roguelite structure. Through a seemingly limitless array of character interactions and plot progression, Hades seeds its storytelling over many hours of repeated runs, as you lead your character along one attempted escape from hell to the next. In addition to weapon and character upgrades, new story insights are among the most satisfying rewards. But that also means that you’ll be eager to see those plot threads resolve, and to do that, you should prepare for an especially long road.Zagreus is the son of mighty Hades, who rules the realm of the dead with a barely controlled anger only matched by his insistence on total control. He’s the definition of an overbearing father, and Zagreus’ desire to strike out on his own feels as much like a family drama as the retelling of a familiar mythology. His quest to find a mother he’s never known brings him into contact with a who’s who of Olympus and the Greek ancient world, including Zeus, Athena, Achilles, and Medusa. The constantly shifting dynamics between these characters makes for great fun, from the sibling rivalry among the Olympians to reconnecting old flames like Orpheus and Eurydice, and I love the way story tidbits creep in both between action sequences and during them.Each escape attempt encompasses a series of isometric arena battles, assaulting an impressive variety of enemies in throwdowns that demand precision and careful observation. The combat is fast-paced and challenging, nodding more to stylish action games like Devil May Cry than the isometric RPGs it might look like at first glance. The sense of adrenaline is always high, but there’s also a potential for encounters to devolve into frantic button mashing as you spam out every available attack to bring foes down before they can unleash their worst counters.New weapons unlock regularly, and they can dramatically change your playstyle, from the precision of the Heart-Seeking Bow to the furious melee dominance of the Twin Fists of Malphon. The most impressive design feat is how even the same weapon inevitably feels different on each run, as god-gifted boons alter and enhance individual armaments, spells, and other abilities. As I got into the rhythm of flowing from one death into my next attempt, I was consistently excited to see how my approach might change.Among the many familiar names encountered, Zagreus gets to know the good-natured Sisyphus, who endlessly pushes a boulder up a hill he will never top, never complaining of his task. It’s an appropriate allegory that speaks to the broader game, which kept me engaged thanks to its slow drip of character improvement and fiction, but along a path that felt increasingly Sisyphean the longer I played. I spent dozens of hours picking away at the various plot threads and chasing upgrades. It’s enjoyable, but as the hours wear on, my interest in the same sequence of chambers wore thin. I longed for a wrap-up, even as the game demanded more escape attempts. Even after “winning,” that tease continues for hours more before a proper conclusion.The story is stretched across too many hours of play to maintain excitement throughout, but there’s absolutely a rich bounty of content to uncover along the way. Hades is a massive game, with a wealth of additional content to appease even the most hardcore of engagement. A “god mode” offers a gradual increase in damage resistance after each death, putting victory in reach for even those with a cap on their skills. On the other hand, risk-takers looking for more rewards can eventually access a way to increase the difficulty. Alternate boss fights, new weapon aspects, hidden storylines, and plenty more invite the player to get lost in Hades’ potential. These variants and additional options provide life to the game, long after the charm of standard completion attempts begins to wear out. Even serious engagement doesn't ensure story completion without many hours of investment, and only the most dedicated players will see the full spread of what Hades has to offer. But Supergiant’s latest opus is a beautiful and thoughtful twist on Greek mythology, flipping these old stories on their head and transforming them into commentaries on modern relationships. High-octane action gameplay may pull you into hell for the first time, but I suspect you’ll stay to find out about this eccentric and fascinating family.

Polygon,"Filed under:An aged, fine wine that would make Dionysus himself proudHades asks you what lengths you would go to defy your shitty dad. Would you stay up late? Mess up his garden? Escape the Greek underworld against his will? In Hades, you are that defiant son. And your asshole dad? That would be Hades, brother to Zeus and Poseidon, lord of the Underworld. And my frequent attempts to escape his grasp make up one of the best games I’ve played all year.I drop into the Underworld at the start of my run — falling gracefully from my second story window in the House of Hades. With my giant sword, I venture forth into Tartarus, just one piece of the Greek underworld. I pick up a random upgrade on my way out the door, increasing my combat potential or drastically altering the way I battle.I obliterate the minions of Hades through random room after random room filled with the cloudy, lost souls hoping to send me back to where I started. I’m awarded a different upgrade after every battle. My strength grows, giving me the power I need to climb even higher as I try to reach the surface. But as always happens in games like Hades, I make a misstep, I lose all my health, and I die. I fall into a pool of blood and go back to where I started. But when I wake up back at home, Hades reveals its true nature. It’s a game where each attempt to get to the end is a run where I battle through the world, collect some resources, and start over with new, permanent upgrades. But Hades maintains the narrative focus and charm found in Supergiant’s other titles — Bastion, Transistor, and Pyre.

And then I approach the desk of my father, Hades. I’m not just some wayward soul trying to escape the underworld, after all, I’m prince of the underworld: Zagreus. Hades has the gruff temperament of Kratos from God of War, acting as if I’ll never do anything good enough for him. The more I talk to him, the more I think there’s some kind of affection beneath his mean exterior, but it’s rare that you ever hear it in his voice. As we chat, Zagreus himself has the smug air of a young adult committed to his goth attitude and aesthetic. Every comment from Zagreus to his father is sarcastic or accusatory. He’s spent eons dealing with Hades, just as Hades has spent eons dealing with Zagreus. There’s a shared history between these two characters, a mix of mistrust, love, exhaustion and frustration. Hades lives in that place of self-superiority, certain that his son will never understand the lengths he’s gone through to be a father and lord of the Underworld. He doesn’t seem to have the time or patience to deal with his son’s rebellion any longer. In response, Zagreus exudes a real “fuck you, old man” attitude, but he’s too cool to ever say it out loud, preferring a sarcastic nod and a biting comment to direct, verbal confrontation. Father and son always part ways with a dismissive laugh or frustrated sigh.Each time I come back from a run through the Underworld, I’m able to have a new conversation with different characters inside Hades’ house. Occasionally, I find Nectar out in the Underworld, which I can give to my friends as gifts, improving my relationship with my mentor Achilles, my step-mother Nyx, and a whole cast of characters — netting me new dialogue and trinkets to help with my escape plan. I enter my room to spend some currency I found on my last run — upgrading myself and increasing my chances at success — and move into the armory. I collect a trinket — gifts from my loved ones — talk to Skelly, my sentient practice dummy, and select a weapon from Hades’ arsenal. Now wielding a spear, I jump back into Tartarus from my second story window and start climbing again.Hades is shown from a top-down perspective. I get to see Zagreus, and all my friends up close when they speak — thanks to beautiful character portraits — but most of the time I’m a red blur dashing between enemies.As Zagreus, I have a deceptively simple combat arsenal. I have a basic attack, a special move, a dash, and a ranged attack called a Cast that fires a ranged barb that sticks into enemies for a brief time. And I have these attacks for each of my six weapons — but I can select only one weapon prior to each run. I can upgrade and alter each of these moves every run, and they combine into something unique every time I play. When I first land in the courtyard of Tartarus, the game randomly offers me one of two things: a Boon or a Daedalus Hammer. The Daedalus Hammer is one of the most desirable upgrades in the game, dramatically  altering how my weapon works. For example, the special ability on the shield is a Captain America-type throw that bounces between a few targets before returning to me. The Daedalus Hammer increases the number of times my shield bounces between enemies. This may not sound exciting at first, but combined with powerful Boons, it could be the key to my escape attempt.The Daedalus Hammer is rare, and I’m lucky to have more than two on any given run. Boons are far more common. These are upgrades passed to me by my uncles and cousins in Olympus. Zagreus has never met Ares, Poseidon, Zeus, Hera, or any of the others, but they all feel sympathy for him. He’s a nice enough kid, and eager to meet his family, and they all know that his dad is the ultimate asshole in Greek myth. So these Boons imbue Zagreus with a fraction of the gods’ powers, to help him on his journey — like handing your nephew a wad of cash before they go off to college and hoping they spend it on more than cigarettes and beer.These Boons offer me minor effects that impact various aspects of combat, usually focused on my attack, special, or Cast. If I pick up the Daedalus upgrade that lets my shield bounce, maybe I would want to find a Zeus Boon that causes my special to spawn lightning bolts on every enemy hit by my special attack? Or a Boon from Dionysus that transforms my Cast into a hazy pool that stuns and poisons targets inside, keeping them still for my shield to bounce.Every run I combine new effects like these together. More often than not, I smile at how absurdly powerful my Zagreus has become. But a good build isn’t everything; I still need to survive my voyage through the Underworld. When I clear my first chamber, I’m presented with a choice of doors. Each has different symbols on the outside, previewing the upgrade I’ll get for completing that room. Do I want a boon from Athena? Or I could just get some gold to shop with? Charon, the boatman, has an underworld shop where I can buy health, Boons, and a variety of other items. No matter what I choose, I move forward. Eventually I reach the first boss, the Furies. This boss fight has a few different varieties, which can change things up between runs. But aside from a few, altered moves, it’s a consistent experience. If I choose upgrades that focus Zagreus’ power too much on clearing rooms filled with basic enemies, I may struggle on the boss fight. And if I focus too much on a boss-killing Zagreus build, I’ll suffer on my way there. When I succeed, I get a brief moment to rest and heal before moving on to the next area of the underworld. Healing doesn’t come easy in Hades, and I take every piece of food, healing fountain, or health bonus I can find. But my failure takes time. At first, I’m sent back to the House of Hades when my health hits zero, but as I go, I gain the ability to revive myself multiple times each run. I see my losses coming rooms away, and more often than not, it’s at the hands of the game’s final boss, in the fourth level of the underworld. But even when I beat that boss and finish my journey, it’s not over. The game tempts me with new materials to upgrade my weapons further and customize my home. But no matter how many runs I win or how many times I’ve fallen, I’m always jumping out that window again, just trying to see what that first upgrade will be, and then the next, and then the next. Hades has been a comfort game for me since it launched into early access in 2018, and it’s especially been an excellent source of comfort over the past few days — something we’re all in short supply of in 2020. I started my first journey through the Underworld in Hades two years ago. The game functioned basically the same as it does now. It was an excellent, fully functional game — albeit with only two bosses. I ran through the first few areas, and got stuck on the Bone Hydra for days. The Bone Hydra was, at the time, the game’s final boss, but is now only the second of four. Every time I tried out a new Hades patch, I would get lost in an endless cycle of runs for a week, and all my gaming time would disappear. Hades has always been so good that it’s hard to put down, and now it’s feature complete with the 1.0 launch on both Nintendo Switch and PC. It’s the same game I loved in 2018, but more of it. More build variety, more weapons, more characters, more areas, more secrets, more story, more everything. Whether it’s the game’s smooth combat, deep loot systems, or engrossing story, I’m always motivated to boot it up and go for another run. Hades is that rare triple threat — like that kid in high school that could act, sing, AND dance. Try as I might, I cannot find fault in Hades. It’s even created a calm in me that no other similar game has. Loss isn’t a frustrating experience met with loud swear words and the sounds of scrambling feet made by my previously sleeping cats. Failure is just another step on a long adventure with one of my favorite games, years in the making and well-worth the wait. Hades left early access on Sept. 17 for Nintendo Switch and Windows PC.

    Suriel Vazquez
   on August 11, 2021 at 10:42AM PDTThe first time I beat the final boss in Hades, I felt an enormous sense of relief. I'd been fighting to see this ending for hours (months, technically, if you count my time in early access), and in roguelikes, it feels better than usual to see an ending. But while I was definitely a little too proud of putting together a set of abilities and perks that shredded the boss after they wrecked me just a few tries ago, that wasn't why I felt tears welling up. I'd gotten so caught up in the story of my character, Zagreus, and the heroes, villains, and gods that had helped him get here that I was elated to have finally gotten him to the end of his journey. What sets Hades apart isn't just that it's a great roguelike with the kind of repeatable depth that makes it engrossing to play for hours, but also how it uses its structure to tell an ongoing story about family, secrets, and resolution.That Hades' narrative is so entwined with its combat is nothing new for the developers at Supergiant Games, who've established themselves as masters of putting your actions in sync with the stories they tell. In a roguelike such as Hades, it means playing as Zagreus, a god of rebirth. Tired of living under his father Hades' thumb and seeking answers about where he comes from, he sets out to escape to the world of the living, battling various undead monsters, living creatures, and mythological figures on his way out.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Hades ReviewYour godliness justifies the endless runs through the depths of the underworld, since dying and coming back to life is par for the course in Greek myth. One of the best parts of Hades, in fact, is returning to the House of Hades time and again after you die. It's not just a pit stop on the way to the next run--it's the centerpiece Hades hinges on. There, figures such as Achilles, Hypnos, and Nyx console you after your deaths, praise you for making progress, and confide in you about one another. You chat with them, undertake side quests, and exchange gifts to deepen your relationships. Eventually, they become vital allies on your quest, even if they're not in the thick of combat with you.These interactions, as much as the precise combat, are the reason I kept coming back to Hades; while I was skeptical about how the roguelike structure would meld with Supergiant Games' focus on characters and stories, they've written and voiced reams of dialogue and lore, and almost all of it is delivered with vigor and is intriguing enough to pore over between your treks through hell.When you finally decide to take another stab at escaping, runs are broken up into a few different worlds, each made up of several randomly ordered chambers. Hades' combat builds on Bastion's tight, isometric fights and infuses them with the endlessly repeatable appeal of random buffs, modifiers, random enemy layouts, currencies, and progression that slowly turn the seemingly impossible task of reaching the surface into something manageable.Combat is quick and reactive, letting you chain attacks into dashes, dashes into special moves, and so on as you learn how to whittle enemy shields, avoid traps, and work over bosses. Each of the six weapons you can equip pushes you to play differently, and weapon-specific modifiers nudge you towards using different parts of your toolset; you might be comfortable poking enemies from afar with the Varatha spear, for example, but with a boon from Daedalus that triples the damage of your dash attack, you're going to want to close the distance and juke constantly. That, and how buffs interact in myriad surprising and effective ways, means I'm still not tired of making these runs, dozens of hours later. In more crowded fights, the Switch's smaller screen makes text and combat readability an issue, as these chambers are large enough to lose details (and runs). Other than that, though, combat is an outstanding mix of random variables and consistent action.And even as you're contemplating whether you want your spear to deal bonus critical damage or imbue your dash with a deflecting shield, tantalizing narrative threads seep through. Most buffs, called boons, are tied to individual gods; if you want that deflect, you're going to have to ask Athena for it, while Artemis is in charge of critical damage. These short exchanges give each god a distinct personality and reflect your actions and progress; you also occasionally catch clues about a potential side quest or plot thread that ties into the larger narrative. I liked Athena, Artemis, and Dionysus not just because their boons were consistently useful, but because I took to Athena's austere will, Artemis' prickly reclusiveness, and Dionysus' laid-back flirtiness.These conversations are more than narrative icing; you can give the gods gifts and build your relationships with them, too. Occasionally, you'll run into rooms where you can score two boons, but only after choosing one god and facing the wrath of the one you scorned as you fight off another round of enemies. Or, if you happen to end up with both that deflective dash and some critical damage, like I did, Athena and Artemis might have a quick chat with each other, then offer you a Duo boon that grants bonus critical damage to projectiles you deflect. As you progress through hell, you'll start seeing those boons used against you, which itself says something; for as much as the gods pay lip service to want to meet them on Olympus when offering boons, your journey to escape torment is little more than a spectacle to them, a game to watch and manipulate from the sidelines.Does that thread lead anywhere? It's hard to say because Hades unfurls so many other threads like this that tie its characters, your actions, and the world together into one cohesive, powerful whole that takes time to unravel. Eventually, you meet characters that sprinkle interesting bonuses into your runs while simultaneously launching new side stories back in the House of Hades, and even bosses change over the course of multiple runs. Supergiant has managed to turn the roguelike, a genre not usually known for riveting plots, into a compelling vehicle for storytelling.Supergiant has managed to turn the roguelike, a genre not usually known for riveting plots, into a compelling vehicle for storytelling.The random nature of the genre does mean the kind of climactic moments that define traditional stories are hard to come by, but I loved that. Rather than face an imposing boss, learning about a new twist of fate, and then moving on to the next act, you have hundreds of conversations with your family, roommates, and enemies about whatever comes to mind. This is where Hades' bid to tell its story differently pays off, as playing it eventually feels like living in a crowded home for months, one where arcs happen, but nothing truly ""ends."" It's the kind of story that makes small moments more significant. After being chided by Hades with a dismissive ""Back again?"" having failed to kill a boss, then listening to everyone around simply wring their hands about the lord of the dead, I understood why Zagreus would want to leave the shadow of his overbearing, distant father. That convergence between player and character motivation is a powerful feeling, and it's what Supergiant delivers so brilliantly.That long-tail approach to worldbuilding may not work for everyone; before I played Hades, I didn't see myself as someone who'd continue to play a roguelike after beating it. But I wanted to keep learning more about these characters and this underworld enough to keep coming back. That, along with a robust postgame that alters every weapon and boss, lets you make the game even harder for more rewards, and offers even more reasons to play an already entrancing mix of RPG and action combat, has absolutely hooked me. When I'm not playing Hades, I'm thinking about how cool it'd be to build the Exagryph machine gun with lighting boons combo that got me that first victorious run, but also throw some critical damage on top of that.I'm also thinking about how much I still have left to learn about Hades, both the character and the game, even dozens of hours in. Like in the Greek myths Hades takes inspiration from, endings aren't tidy, and they're almost never final. They're protracted, often unsatisfying, and are hard to find real closure in, and the fact that Hades understands this is its greatest strength. I'm sure there's a point where, after running through hell enough times, I'll have seen all Hades has to offer, both in its clever and endless fights and its many alluring characters, intimate moments, and rewarding quests. The story does end. But what matters so much more are all the moments between the start and end of a story, and the people who help us see those climactic moments but also stick with us between them. They're the reason we keep trying, and the reason we keep coming back.Hades is every bit the challenging and heartfelt journey that it's been on Nintendo Switch and PC, with the release on Xbox Series S|X, PS5, Xbox One, and PS4 providing more options for how to play one of 2020's best games. If you are returning from several hours on another platform, you might be disappointed that Hades doesn't support the same cross-save functionality that it does between PC and Nintendo Switch. So, whether you're a new player or a veteran, you will be starting your escape from the underworld from scratch.What is noticeably better with this release, especially if you've only played the Nintendo Switch version, is the overall clarity of the action. Hades on the Nintendo Switch ran beautifully but suffered from small text issues when played in handheld mode and looked quite soft when docked to a much larger display, such as a 4K TV. With Hades on current-generation consoles, 4K is the target, bringing a new layer of crispness and clarity to both the action and all the biomes it takes place in. The frame rate is rock solid too, never wavering from its 60fps target in a noticeable way. Combat sings with this fluidity, with the added definition letting you make out every detail, whether it's an enemy's attack or the bubbling lava of Asphodel.Loading times were never slow on other platforms, but especially when compared to the Nintendo Switch these new SSD-powered consoles make transitions between areas and runs overall feel a little zippier than before. These are small improvements that you might only notice if you've already sunk numerous hours into Hades on another platform, but they create a strong foundation for its debut on new hardware. Hades is the same brilliant rougelite that it was last year, but now with even more places to enjoy it than before. -- Alessandro BarbosaUse your keyboard!Log in to comment"
Kotaku,"Hades is my game of the year. It’s also the game of the year. I don’t mean to say that Hades is objectively the best, because that’s an impossible metric (and also Baldur’s Gate 3 isn’t out yet). Rather, developer Supergiant’s Greek mythology-flavored action roguelike is, improbably, the game that best characterizes the year 2020. (This review discusses Hades’ story in a fair amount of depth and includes both minor and major spoilers. I’ve denoted the sections where major spoilers occur. If you haven’t finished the game—and I mean really finished it—and wish to avoid spoilers, probably skip those sections.)As other writers have observed, Hades, which entered early access in 2018 and recently launched its 1.0 version after almost two years of additional development, is about being trapped inside a house—the house of your crappy dad, Hades, specifically—and coming to terms with the fact that you cannot leave. More than that, it is a game whose structure and story are both rooted in repeated, inescapable failure. As Zagreus, the son of Hades, you try to slash, shield bash, spear, bow, punch, and gun your way out of hell, but no matter how many demonic shades fall after (ode to a Grecian) earning your ire, you end up back where you started.2020, in case you yourself are a celestial being who exists outside of time, has been a year of constant setbacks. It began with a horribly mismanaged pandemic that’s claimed over 200,000 lives in America alone. Now each passing moment brings fresh tragedy or injustice. Every day, we learn of yet another failed effort on the part of good people to so much as toss a wrench into the gears of an endless number of greedy, uncaring machines—many of which have been running in some form or fashion since before any of us were ever born. We get sick. We lose our jobs. Or some combination of the resulting tension and time/distance strain the small handful of relationships we value most. As the year comes to a close, it feels like even precious patches of gained ground are slipping into the abyss. It’s become hard to focus, hard to see a point in fighting, or even just keeping up the mundane pretenses of daily life, in the face of an unabating slide into mask-off despotism.Hades is a game about what people do once they’ve realized that failure is inevitable. How do you spend your time when you live in a house built on a foundation of a failure, when all you and those around you can do is fail, when failure will come whether you act or choose to do nothing at all? Sure, the people in Hades’ case are Greek gods, but Greek gods are just people with better muscles and (slightly) worse decision-making skills when they’re horny.Supergiant describes Hades as a roguelike, but only because there’s not really a good genre descriptor that sums up what it really is. In between action-based runs through the ever-shifting halls of Tartarus, Asphodel, Elysium, and the Temple of Styx, you spend ample time talking to various gods, goddesses, shades (ghosts, basically), and Dusa, who defies categorization. Also Cerberus, who is both bigger than all other dogs and has three heads, thus making him quantifiably the best boy. You can give these characters gifts to strengthen your bonds, but just conversing with them over the course of countless runs is enough to peel back many of their layers.You get to know these characters as 10 hours give way to 20, 30, 60, and onward. When I first encountered Achilles while playing Hades’ early access version over the summer, I thought he was a dreary shadow perpetually posed against the same dull wall. Now, months later, he’s like a father, brother, and maybe more to me—a font of generosity in spite of his own past failures. These slow-build interactions, which sometimes move at a speed akin to that of real-life relationships, are just as central to Hades as making a mess of Hell on your way to the surface. Characters, in turn, react to your progress and deeds, some of which come to directly involve them. Given the number of possible permutations of your progress both through the game and with various characters, it is a mind-bogglingly complex narrative system that somehow manages to feel coherent at almost all times.You can also go fishing. And renovate your house!These relationships mean that Hades’ goals are fundamentally different from those of other roguelikes, many of which prioritize difficulty and mastery above all else. Hades builds upon that foundation, but despite a focus on failure, the game isn’t actually about the player beating their head against a series of brick walls until they finally break through. Now that many of my friends have started playing Hades, I’ve heard a few of them express frustration about particular bosses or their struggles in certain areas. I always tell them: “Give it a few more runs. You’ll get past that part, and then, a few more runs after that, you’ll be amazed that you ever had trouble in the first place.” Note that I do not say, “You’ll get past that part if you use weapon X or employ strategy Y.” Because those particulars do not matter.Despite being a game that can easily last 80 or 100 hours (if you want to do and see everything, anyway), Hades is a game that respects the heck out of players’ time. Each run yields some form of tangible progress, both in terms of character dialogue and items that can be used to permanently boost your stats, making you better able to withstand whatever challenges you face. Fights also do a subtly sublime job of preparing you for future fights; enemies and bosses call forward to each other. You might stroll into the gargantuan Bone Hydra’s lava lair for the first time and think “Oh god, I’m about to get my ass kicked,” but you’re never actually in over your head. Even if you’re having trouble making bone-heads or bone-tails of its attack patterns, you’ll eventually gain enough HP and death defiances (think “lives” in classic games) that you’ll have ample room for error. If that’s not enough, you can also toggle on “God Mode,” which gives a slight, steadily increasing boost to your damage resistance after each failed run. It makes narrative sense—you’re a friggin’ god, after all—and it doesn’t lock you out of anything.But even if you rough it, like I did, you’ll likely become powerful and savvy enough that you’ll eventually gain the presence of mind to start working your creative muscles. Each Hades run is full of randomized powerups and “boons” from various gods and goddesses that imbue Zagreus with additional powerful abilities but only last until you die. To give just a small handful of examples: Athena can put a shield around your default dash ability, allowing you to slam enemies’ projectile attacks back into them. Ares can add “Doom” to your regular or special attacks, which causes enemies to take a burst of damage after they’ve been hit (you can stack these bursts and add all kinds of fun modifiers to them, too). Artemis can boost your critical hit chance through the roof. Zeus adds lightning to abilities, because that is his main thing (aside from very bad horny decisions).I have yet to find many wrong choices here. There are definitely builds that will just melt bosses, but unlike in other roguelikes, I’ve never felt the need to seek out guides or optimal builds to give myself a real chance at success. I developed my own play style over time, and it works for me, even if it sounds—as I’ve said previously—heretical on paper. No matter which weapon I’m wielding, I never stop dashing. I don’t really use my special or cast attacks much. I focus my boon selection on raw damage and critical hit chance. I seek out Athena’s shield with religious fervor. All of this transforms Zagreus into a sort of disco ball spam cannon, and it’s a great time. I’ve completed over 20 runs, many of them with the “heat” (a set of conditions players can activate to make Hades harder, in exchange for better rewards) turned up. My method, crude though it might be, works. But I’ve also watched my partner, friends, and various Twitch streamers take other approaches that may or may not be equally effective, but are nonetheless viable, if not better.Hades presents the illusion of difficulty and a brutal learning curve, but it ensures that, no matter what, everybody will eventually get over the finish line. Its ever-changing labyrinth is a hall of mirrors, but not in a maliciously deceptive way. Rather, it intentionally seeks to invite players into a genre that, for some, has previously come across as alienating or daunting without removing any of the underlying substance. No matter how you play, you experience the tension of staring down imposing bosses, the thrill of accidentally assembling your dream build. You die a whole, whole lot, but you do it at your own pace.This brings us to Hades’ central contradiction: It is a game about failure, but it’s deeply concerned with your success. However, even when Zagreus succeeds, he still fails. He makes it to the surface—pulls off his grand escape—only to wind up back in Hell’s famed blood pool, up to his eyeballs in death. The journey isn’t really about overcoming the system you’re trapped inside of, because you can’t. Zag tries, and then he dies. Regardless of extenuating circumstances along the way—and there are many—this remains a constant.(Major spoilers begin here.)Pinched between the cruel fingers of The Fates, Hades’ story becomes a tale about reframing failure. When what you really want remains just outside your grasp, what can you do? A whole lot, it turns out. While Zagreus’ escape attempts never, say, save the world or change the course of Greek myth, each one slowly but surely improves the lives of those in his community. Initially, this is largely the byproduct of a self-serving approach: You clean up the lounge in the house of Hades so that you can exchange gems, won during runs, and other currencies for additional items and currencies that help improve subsequent runs. You give gifts to characters in exchange for “keepsakes” that yield special bonus stats and abilities for as long as they’re equipped. Other improvements follow, but they take on a decidedly less selfish, more personal bent. You help Orpheus, the dour but good-natured musician, rediscover his muse. You reconnect Achilles with his lost love. You get Megaera and her, uh, very different sisters back on speaking terms. You make a bunch of cosmetic improvements to the lounge that don’t do jack for your escape attempts, but they make the life of Dusa the Gorgon, functionally an overworked housekeeper, easier. It takes a long, long, long time for Zagreus’ relationships with his closest blood relatives to improve, but in the meantime, he creates meaningful bonds with his found family and makes his homeland a more livable place. Not only that, he reveals himself to be the kind of guy who’ll just listen to random shades talk about how they died, helpfully bring fish to the lounge’s chef, and even just quietly celebrate whoever most recently took home the title of lounge employee of the [incalculable amount of time because the future is also the present in Hell, sort of, it’s hard to explain]. Zagreus never stops being a spoiled prince, but he comes to regard everyone around him, regardless of status, as people with their own wants, needs, and existences.Zagreus begins his journey trying to get the hell out of Hades. He seeks to escape, heedless of what that might mean for those he leaves behind. There’s a sort of nihilism underpinning this: Sure, he has a very personal reason for departing, but he also sees the place itself as emblematic of his father’s failure. It’s beyond redemption, so why stay? Over time, though, his focus shifts. There is no big revelation, no on-the-nose “aha” moment that heralds this change in his personal trajectory. He just sort of starts helping other characters and rebuilding a place that’s fallen to pieces after eons of structural neglect, and even as his own situation reveals itself to be more and more dire, he ramps up his efforts. Other characters, in turn, go from being quietly insulted that he’s leaving to openly pleased that he’s staying and finally pitching in. By the time it becomes abundantly clear that Zagreus will never be able to leave Hades, you get the sense that he’s made his peace with it. He’s figured out what he can do, and though it’s not as grandiose as his original plan, it might be more important.I began playing Hades near the beginning of this summer, when it was still in early access. The game’s ending was fundamentally different back then, as it had been in various permutations since 2018. In the mid-2020 version of the game, you squared off with Hades and, if you sent him packing, Zagreus would try to proceed onward into Greece, only to suddenly be torn asunder by some unseen force as he crossed the threshold. “Is there no escape?” text at the top of the screen would ask. Then Zag would awaken back in the old blood pool.This was a very bleak ending! As I did subsequent runs to see more character dialogue and unlock upgrades, Hades continually asked Zagreus why he even bothered; all that awaited him was an endless series of painful, pointless deaths. I spent probably 30 hours of game time with those stakes firmly in place. Zag would turn back the forces of hell, beat up his dickbag dad, and then die gruesomely as some invisible hand wrung him out like a dish towel. This put the hopelessness of the situation into stark focus. Zag was trapped in Hell in multiple senses: the physical location, sure, but also the pure misery that is doing something repeatedly in hopes of creating change, only to produce the same results every time.But this also forced the spotlight onto the tangible outcomes of Zagreus’ actions. Despite his deaths, the lives of those around him improved. The house of Hades did, too. I chose to make those improvements because I didn’t have much else to do with the resources I was amassing. But it felt good. It felt like an extension of who Zagreus had become while stuck in the blades of this nightmarish blender. The system Zagreus found himself trapped in was hopeless, but the situation was not. Life was not. It was an extremely powerful statement delivered through a combination of mechanics, narrative, and an incomplete game.I kinda wish that was still the ending. But due to the fickle nature of early access, that version of Hades no longer exists. A large chunk of the game I played is not the game people are playing now, but that portion indelibly colored my experience. The game I played told a different story that, intentionally or not, made a different point. Until, as of the full 1.0 release, it didn’t.In both early access and the 1.0 release, in addition to escaping from Hades, Zagreus also wants to find his long-lost mother, Olympian goddess Persephone. He didn’t even learn she was his mother until adulthood, long after she’d both secretly moved to and eventually fled the underworld. In the version of the game where Zagreus’ goal was unattainable, this didn’t matter all that much. It could have been anything else, but due to the structure of the game at the time, it would not have impacted what, in its absence, ended up feeling to me like the point of the story.In the 1.0 version of the game, after you defeat Hades, Zagreus leaves the confines of hell and finds Persephone. After a brief bit of long-overdue mother-son bonding, Zagreus becomes weak and dies. It turns out he can’t survive topside for long. The game then turns into a series of jaunts to the surface (assuming you’re able to defeat Hades each time) wherein Zagreus frantically scrambles to learn bits and pieces about why his mom left, what Hades stood to gain by hiding it from him, and how to get his mom to return to the underworld. I read most of these conversations as a doomed effort. Persephone had regrets, sure, but she liked the life and home she’d built for herself and did not seem to be in a hurry to get reacquainted with the lord of the dead. That was fine with me. My parents are divorced; when I was a kid, I wished more than anything that they’d get back together. In reality, they’d already stayed together longer than they should have for my sister and me, and it made them both miserable.In Hades’ release version, Persephone ends up returning with Zagreus to the underworld after you defeat Hades 10 times. The two of you hop into a small boat captained by Styx boatman-turned-item-salesman Charon, and the credits roll. It’s a nice moment. Then, in a post-credits scene, Persephone forces Hades to more or less own up to his bullshit. It all feels a little too tidy. Years of verbal and physical abuse, a colossal web of lies, a stoic belief that Hades knew best that ended up pushing everybody he cared about away, and leadership that caused a kingdom to crumble, and all his own son gets is a quick “Oh dip, my B”? Admittedly, it’s a bit more complicated than that, and Zag does hold Hades accountable for most of his wrongdoings. But when I first watched the scene play out, it still didn’t feel true to the otherwise nuanced nature of the game. Plus, questions remained unanswered: How would the other Olympian gods react to the illicit presence of one of their own in Hell? They’d waged earthshaking wars for less, after all.This ending was, to me, a grand anticlimax. Fortunately, Hades was not over. After beating Hades, you haven’t beaten Hades. After beating Hades 10 times, convincing Persephone to come home, and watching the credits roll, you haven’t beaten Hades. Even after the credits, the game goes on for hours and hours. While some players, myself included, have reached Hades’ final scene, they still haven’t puzzled out exactly what number of runs or other preconditions trigger it. But as with everything else in the game, it seems to be inevitable. You just have to keep making runs and talking to characters, who react to the sudden return of their queen. You just have to stick with it.(Major spoilers end here.)I cannot evaluate Hades without factoring in the period of time in which I played it. This is true for basically all games: How many classics have you spent years nostalgically pining for, only to realize upon finally replaying them that you were actually longing for a simpler time or circumstance? But I think this holds especially true for my read on Hades, both in terms of what resonated and what left me feeling a little conflicted.I first started playing Hades around the same time Black Lives Matter protests erupted across the nation. It feels like an eternity ago, at least in terms of the sense of possibility that gripped The Discourse at the time. It felt like people were really waking up to the bloody havoc police regularly wreak on Black people and the structural damage that communities endure so that police’s coffers can remain overstuffed. Perhaps more importantly, it seemed like Americans were no longer writing off alternative ideas about how to improve communities. Activists have advocated for abolition and defunding for at least as long as militarized police forces have existed, but earlier this year, it briefly felt like the moment they’d been fighting so hard for had finally arrived. Defunding became a mainstream talking point. It seemed like, perhaps, at least in Democratically-led cities, people could begin forcing fundamentally unjust systems into a shape that vaguely resembled justice.But, as we all know by now, things haven’t worked out that way. As the months drew on, police abuse of protesters continued unabated as major media organizations fixated on property damage instead of human lives and the police’s role in instigating violence. Far-right extremist militia members shot people and sought refuge among police ranks. Now we stand in the crosshairs of a Presidential election that seems poised to spark off even worse violence in the streets and potentially steal away whatever small semblance of democracy remains in this country.Hopelessness is in right now. How could it not be? People rose up, but the historically awful status quo rose higher. What is there left to do but go on Twitter and Facebook and post different variations of “We’re fucked” alongside whatever headline you read most recently? I’m a white guy in no present danger beyond what I subject myself to. Despite this, I spent a lot of the summer despairing.I will not go so far as to say Hades got me through it. At this point in my life, I am skeptical of games’ ability to do things of that magnitude. But as the summer wore on, Hades’ story of somebody refusing to despair in the face of overwhelming systemic failure and instead pivoting into helping rebuild his community and support his found family took on a new significance. I watched people much smarter than me talk about how hopelessness is useless, good causes are gaining ground in smaller ways, and no matter where you live, there are vitally important grassroots organizations that anybody can contribute to—people need only seek them out. I knew this logically, but that didn’t reassure me much. Hades helped me feel it.In the coming months and years, things are likely to get worse. But in recent times, Hades has given me some darn good days, and much more importantly, it’s helped me keep in mind that literally everybody is capable of giving somebody they’re close to—or just some rando, or a group of randos, or whatever—a couple of good days. In time, that can and hopefully will coalesce into something larger. In the meantime, it’s what we’ve got, and it’s not nothing.(Major spoilers begin here.)While sticking with Hades for what I thought was going to be an additional day but turned out to be an additional week of late-night “just one more run” sessions, I found the game’s epilogue—which unfolded in the same format as the regular game—to be much more complicated than its too-neat ending. During or after runs, Zagreus and Hades would regularly jaw back and forth about their broken relationship—both engaging, finally, in something resembling good faith, but with Hades continuing to insist that his actions were partially justified and his abusive habits were immutable. Meanwhile, Zagreus and Persephone tried to build a relationship, but it was clear that they had a lot of lost time to make up for.Still, when the game finally “ended,” it wrapped up with an optimistic but messy message about family, which you’d expect from a game starring famously dysfunctional Greek gods. By this point, Zagreus’ role within the house of Hades had also changed. Instead of trying to actually break out, he’d become an official staff member tasked with testing Hell’s defenses and keeping up appearances so that no nosy Olympian gods would come a-knocking. He’d more or less been assimilated into the broken system. He’d gained a seat at the table, but the status quo endured.It left me wondering if a game that needs you to be able to run through it infinitely could ever actually be about dismantling a structure, rather than reifying it. But Hades is a gargantuan game about many things. I can’t knock it too much for veering off course at the end, especially when what resonated most with me probably wasn’t even the final destination to begin with. Hades isn’t just a game about failure. It’s also about family, sacrifice, the lies people tell themselves, and a whole host of other subjects. It takes source material that is often quite dark and a central narrative that is very grim and comes out with something that is remarkably lighthearted. It’s a heck of a balancing act, but Hades pulls it off. Supergiant has managed, against all odds, to craft a Greek mythological tale that gives most characters a happy ending.(Major spoilers end here.)I’ve come to appreciate that optimism, especially now that I’ve gotten to watch many other people experience this fundamentally more hopeful version of the game than the one I first played. Hades and its cast of hot gods are giving players a much-needed reprieve from everything else. This dovetails nicely with the game’s own mechanical kindness; like Thanatos, the god of death who expresses his affection by giving you health-increasing hearts, Hades acts all distant and difficult at first, but it really just wants you to have everything your heart desires. It wants to help you achieve your goals at a pace that suits you.""After deliberating briefly, Cerberus concludes that, yes, he shall accept the sack.""Narrative-driven bad dad puncher.A multifaceted story that unfolds based on how you play, sublime combat that rewards experimentation, challenges that are only as difficult as you want them to be, all the good feelings of roguelikes without a lot of the hassle.Some late-game story stuff, other roguelikes are probably ruined for me now.Supergiant GamesPC (Played), Nintendo SwitchDecember 16, 2018 (early access), September 17, 2020 (version 1.0)90 hours of the PC version (50 or so while the game was in its final stages of early access)Yesterday, I tweeted about how it’s fun to watch people edge up against completing a run for the first time—saying they’re about to “beat” Hades—because they have no idea what they’re in for. One person replied by saying that “the actual best story of Hades is the one that the player has with their experience of the game.” It would, in the case of so many other games, be a banal observation, but in this case, it rings unusually true. Hades unfurls itself in what could be an infinite number of different configurations based on how you play—or, if we take early access into account, even when you played.It is so large and generous that it’s going to leave many different people with many different takeaways based on which characters and ideas they latch onto first or last or in the middle. Some will be longer-winded than mine, others will be as simple as “dash good” (and oh man, the dash is so, so good). This is not all to say that Hades tries to wriggle out of saying anything definitive. It says plenty no matter how you slice it. But a good story is in the telling, and Hades tells its story a little differently to everybody. It’s like a good myth, in that regard. Or a hydra, in that it has a lot of heads, but nobody can quite agree on exactly how many.In Hades, one of Greek myth’s most famous characters, the boulder-pushing Sisyphus, has a bit part. When he’s not eternally rolling a rock up a hill, he doles out items in the game’s first area, Tartarus. Despite his arduous, backbreaking lot in un-life, he comes across as blissfully cheerful—a ray of sunshine in the dank depths of Hades’ deepest chambers. Some players have observed that this is similar to a rumination on the character by philosopher and author Albert Camus, who in 1942 famously wrote that “one must imagine Sisyphus happy,” basically saying that if Sisyphus accepted the futility of his struggle—or at least, its lack of an inherent meaning or goal—he could find contentedness within it.In a Reddit AMA last week, Hades writer and designer Greg Kasavin said that this was not a deliberate nod, but added that it’s “pretty cool” that he and Camus arrived at similar conclusions. To me, this particular riff on Sisyphus naturally arises not just from the reality of his situation, but also, in Hades’ case, Zagreus’ story. Sisyphus serves as a sort of reflection, a microcosm of Zagreus’ own Sisyphean struggle and the contentedness he can find in accepting that, for the time being, he may not be able to break free from the hell that confines and defines his whole world, but he can still at the very least make small but meaningful improvements to the lives of those around him.The work never ends. Let’s get pushing.In Hades, each Infernal Arm you use to escape from Hell has its own unique abilities. The different Hades is amazing.

HADES REVIEW FOR PC AND NINTENDO SWITCH. As is now essentially tradition, developer Supergiant Giants has spent three years making a new game that is polished and filled to the brim with exciting content. Bastion (2011), Transistor (2014), Pyre (2017), and now Hades (2020) enjoy critical acclaim and hardcore support from fans. During its early access period, we could see that Hades was going to be something special, but wow has the 1.0 blown me away. This is the Game Revolution review.As with any Supergiant Games title, it’s the presentation that initially draws the player in. Hades looks visually stunning with a style that complements the Greek mythology it incorporates. The different levels of the underworld are clearly distinguished and populated with unique traps. Animations are smooth and combat visuals look awesome and dangerous.Hades tells a compelling story that also pushes the player towards multiple completions. Though it took me 14 hours to reach the ending, I must now complete it again to learn more, which I plan to do after hitting “Publish” on this review!The highlight, though, is the design of the gods that assist and hinder protagonist Zagreus as he attempts to escape hell, against the wishes of his father, Hades. Though they are stationary in appearance, each god oozes charisma with superb voice acting that covers hours and hours of dialogue. As a player, I look forward to meeting my favorite gods and developing a relationship for additional benefits. Before you know it, you’re immersed and loving it!Boons from the gods, as well many other items and buffs, will help Zagreus on his path through the underworld. Thankfully, Zagreus is already pretty powerful and fun to play as, with a host of different weapons that can really shake up the way he controls. As silly as it might sound, I found the shield and bow to be most satisfying in my 20+ hours of play, though I’m looking forward to using swords and spears as I put in countless more time.Combat is smooth and satisfying, with even the Nintendo Switch satisfying the 60 FPS frame-rate for the most part. Zagreus largely depends on dashing about the screen to avoid deadly blasts and benefits from invincibility frames that are a delight to master. Once there’s an opening to attack, Zag has three move types at his disposal, along with a devastating “Call” function that is unlocked after a few runs.The randomized Boons largely dictate which moves you’ll be using. While one run might see the player spamming Special attacks for the entire session, another might push Zag down a path of switching between Attack and Cast. For the most part, there is enough flexibility in the Boon choices to keep players feeling lethal, but you can sometimes be forced to use a less exciting build. This provides its own unique challenge but can make that particular run less fun. (Of course, you can always just hit “Give up” and try again.)Occurrences of a “bad build” are very rare, however, with Zag often enhanced beyond belief into an overpowered underworld-shattering specimen. Whether it’s from the lightning-charged buffs that Zeus provides or the “Drunk” status effects allowed by Dionysus, or any of the many gods in between, there’s always an exciting upgrade around the corner.In addition to Boons, Zag can find other items like coins, Centaur Hearts, Daedalus’ Hammers, and Pom of Powers to enjoy per-run buffs. These allow for more choices and enhancements to make each run more unique. What’s more, upon death Zag doesn’t totally reset. Permanent upgrades can be purchased using the Darkness currency, as well as Gemstones and an Ambrosia treat.It’s these permanent upgrades that will be a key focus in the early game, as Zagreus is likely to fall at the first boss. The next time around, he’ll have a better grasp on combat, additional health, and a new weapon. It’s the progression over the time that remains addicting, without becoming repetitive. Even after 100 hours, players will still be uncovering new ways to play and equipment combinations.The speed at which you can rise through the depths of hell also helps avoid the feeling of repetition. Though areas may become familiar, their layouts and enemy types are randomized. What took 20 minutes before may only take five with Zag’s new upgrades. Chasing Boons for your “ultimate build” powers an addiction that will have you replaying over and over again in the same session.Though the PC version can run at higher resolutions and frame-rates, it’s the Nintendo Switch edition that I’ve spent the most time with. It’s easy to put in a 30-minute session during a break, knowing that you’re going to kill hundreds of enemies and fight a bunch of bosses in quick succession, with no busywork to hold you back. Though you can sink in hundreds of hours, Hades still respects the player’s time.Provided you can handle the fast-paced combat that Hades throws at you, which can be a little stressful, this game is a must-play. Whether it’s on PC or Nintendo Switch, this title runs incredibly smoothly with god-tier responsiveness in controls. It’s Supergiant Games’ best title yet, which is saying something as I loved Bastion, and a serious Game of the Year 2020 contender.Hades takes the hated cycle of retrying the same checkpoint over and over again, flips it on its head with rewarding progression, and makes the player genuinely look forward to starting anew. There really is nothing like it with this level of polish and execution. Gods, it’s impressive!Hades was reviewed on PC (Ryzen 7 3700X, 32 GB RAM, RTX 2070) and Nintendo Switch with code provided by the publisher.Mack is slowly grinding his way to Level 100. With each article you read, he gets 1 XP! // 23,597 XP UNTIL NEXT LEVEL //Share article"
Destructoid,"darkThe buzz surrounding Hades is spot-on, and it only took one failed escape from hell for me to fall in love with its isometric hack-and-slash combat. It’s blisteringly fast but readable even when your screen is full of fiends. It’s easy to pick up but full of tough decisions. There are six weapons, all of which feel worthwhile, and countless god-given boons with which to improve and drastically alter them.If you’ve been holding out for the 1.0 release of Hades because you try to avoid messing with Early Access on principle or you wanted to wait for a proper conclusion to the story, the time has come.For all of 2020’s misery, I can’t believe how many incredible roguelikes this year has brought us.Hades (PC [reviewed], Nintendo Switch)Developer: Supergiant GamesPublisher: Supergiant GamesReleased: September 17, 2020MSRP: $24.99I’ve put something like 20 hours into Hades‘ final release, and I have no regrets – which is good considering I’m bound to double that tally. I keep trying to get Hades “out of my system,” but it’s unshakable. This is the culmination of everything Supergiant Games has been working toward.The secret sauce – aside from stellar action-RPG combat – is character-driven storytelling.As Zagreus, the defiant son of Hades, you’ll make a mad dash through Tartarus, Asphodel, and Elysium with hopes of reaching Greece and gaining insight. Along the way – during runs and also back home at your “base” of sorts – you’ll converse with legendary mythological figures, all of whom are voiced and full of personality in thoughtful ways. Rather than tell a linear story, Hades is dished out through morsels of conversation that fit the context of a world in which death is an inevitable inconvenience.It’s a perfectly-conceived setting for a roguelike, one that often feels alive by reacting to what you, the player, are up to – without coming across as artificial or “game-y.” These character interactions are wonderful. Supergiant’s carrot-on-a-stick story and repeatable game loop go hand in hand, and that takes the sting out of defeat. After mastering the default half-hour-or-so run, I feel motivated to keep playing, in large part, for more incremental story bits. At the same time, I’m still loving the flexible combat system and I’m pushing myself by toggling on some of the many endgame difficulty modifiers.There’s a lot of minutia in the background initially, to the point where Hades‘ first few hours run the risk of overwhelming players who are (understandably) curious about permanent upgrades. Several meta currencies can be used to improve your odds of breaking out of the underworld, and if you fixate up front – if you’re too concerned with “winning” as early as possible – you’ll be doing yourself a disservice.Win or lose, ultimately, you’ll be pulled back to the House of Hades. Zagreus is stuck in an endless loop, but life goes on. At home, you’ll run into bosses (even the Big Guy himself) that you potentially fought and slayed on your last run, with no hard feelings – chances are they’ll have something interesting to say about it. You might chat up Achilles, pet Cerberus, or train with Skelly, and be on your way again.In other words, Hades rewards every attempt. The main narrative concerning Zagreus, Hades, and Persephone will start coming into focus as you continuously teach your old man a lesson, but the personal stories – including friendships and romances – can and will play out in spite of botched runs.What if you don’t care to engage with that side of Hades outside of the bare minimum? The good news is that it’s still a ridiculously fun, well-balanced action-RPG experience, and you won’t be bogged down by dialogue. After 20 hours, I still enjoy beating up the most basic creeps. That says something.There are three full biomes, the first two of which are an eternal pleasure to burn through and the third of which sometimes has slight pacing issues depending on your build and how equipped you are to handle waves of enemies that need to be killed twice to truly die. A fourth zone, the Temple of Styx, serves as a smaller choose-your-own-adventure “time to stock up for the final boss” buffer. It’s all right.Within these biomes, you’ll fight monsters or chat with friendly faces on a room-by-room basis rather than explore a continuous stretch of land. In most cases, there are two choices – you can pick which room to enter next and you’ll plainly see what reward is going to be up for grabs (once you learn what each symbol means). Later, with an upgrade, you can even re-roll rewards if you don’t like the selection.At first, I was expecting more of an exploration vibe from Hades – it’s almost non-existent – but I grew to appreciate the straight-to-the-action structure. That makes it a joy to replay and grind for upgrades.Speaking of which, expect to die a lot until you’ve made permanent purchases with the Mirror of Night in your bedroom. These unlocks can give you benefits like an extra dash, more longevity – including, at most, three “extra lives” on each run – and also boost your odds of seeing higher-tier boons pop up.Boons are frequently doled out as a reward for clearing rooms, and they’re your chance to hear a message from the gods of Olympus, each of whom has a gameplay-specific area of expertise. Athena can help you deflect projectiles back at their source, Zeus has lightning chains, and Chaos will offer a range of powerful perks in exchange for a harsh temporary debuff. Boons are used to create and modify your build on the fly for the duration of your current run; they’re my favorite part of Hades by far.Each boon can branch off in a few different initial directions, and those directions can further mix and match and be upgraded as your run progresses. I can’t oversell how satisfying these abilities become. There’s rarely a clear-cut best choice – everything has potential, and I never quite know where my character build will take me. I can’t say the same for most other action-leaning roguelike games.Going a step further, every weapon – from the Eternal Spear to the Adamant Rail (gun) to the Shield of Chaos – has hidden “aspects” that you can permanently unlock to specialize your playstyle. I’m obsessed with the Heart-Seeking Bow and its ability to “tag” a target with my main arrow and then fire off a spread of homing shots from a safe distance. I love powering that up with assists from uncle Zeus.Zagreus also has a metered ability (based on the different gods) that you can charge up throughout battles and there are finite spell-like projectiles that you can “stick” in enemies, recover, and fire off again. Without breaking down every mechanic, let’s just say combat is fluid, dynamic, and full of life.Discovering synergies just doesn’t seem to get old. Effects stack up in delightfully powerful ways.For those of us who adore a capital-g Grind, this one delivers. Supergiant gives ample opportunities to accumulate meta currencies during dungeon runs, and you can even trade them (to get precisely what you need) back home. I was able to easily prioritize and work toward the specific unlocks I wanted.If anything bummed me out in Hades, I’d probably point to unevenness in the latter two zones, which sometimes feel like I’m going through the motions, and an arguable missed opportunity for a larger boss roster. Supergiant designed several genuinely memorable (and highly replayable) fights, but it leaned a bit too heavily on variants. They don’t all shake things up as much as I would’ve liked.At the same time, those criticisms stand out to me mostly because everything else is so excellent. If you’ve enjoyed this studio’s other games, for what it’s worth, I’d call Hades the best of the bunch. And if you’re worried about hitting a brick wall and potentially missing the big-picture story moments, don’t be afraid to turn on the “God Mode” toggle for a guilt-free defensive boost to help you defeat dear dad.Hades had the unenviable task of bridging a well-established action-roguelike format with impactful character-driven storytelling, and neither element feels like an afterthought. They lift each other to new heights. The finer details – all those little artistic touches that add up over time – really seal the deal.It’s hard to imagine anyone other than Supergiant pulling off this Herculean feat with such style.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]SuperbA hallmark of excellence. There may be flaws, but they are negligible and won't cause massive damage.

Shacknews,"New to Shacknews? Signup for a Free AccountAlready have an account? Login NowWe got our Greek on and went rampaging through the Underworld in Hades, but is this mythology-inspired roguelike truly godly or cursed by hubris?Hades was an altogether different kind of thing for Supergiant Games, who has, at this point, made a habit of exploring new spaces with each outing. The studio is no stranger to isometric and stylized games though, but where Pyre was a sort of sports story, Transister was RPG intensive, and Bastion was a action with a singular route, Hades is a shifting and contorting roguelike. Despite the nature of difficulty and randomness of these games, Supergiant has found a way to tell an engrossing narrative filled to the brim with good music, enjoyable progression, and vividly enjoyable depictions of the ancient Greek pantheon and its heroes and villains.No, it’s true. Hades is a roguelike with a good story to tell. As Zagreus, son of Hades who was born and raised in the Underworld, you’ve had enough of your life in the Halls of the Dead. And so Zagreus plots to escape. Hades doesn’t exactly try to stop his son because he’s a busy man with countless souls of the deceased to judge. Also, the Underworld is a shifting series of realms full of angry souls that will go out of their way to kill anyone who tries to leave. And if Zagreus dies… well, where is he going to go? Florida? Nope, he spawns right back in his old man’s home to begin the journey again.What sets Hades apart immediately from other roguelikes like it is that death has context to push the story forward just a little bit each time. Your home base of sorts in Hades’ home is filled to the brim with an expanding cast of characters that share unique conversation with Zagreus every time he returns. Among them are the Underworld lord Hades himself, three-headed-heck-guard-doggo-turned-best-boy Cerberus (yes, Cerberus has dialogue and will let you give him pets, the almost-immortal warrior and teacher Achilles, the motherly Nyx, and more. Everyone has something new to share with Zagreus if (when) he comes home.It’s not confined to Hades’ hall either. Out in the battlefields of Tartarus, Asphodel, and more, the other Greek gods of Olympus will send Zagreus messages and aid to empower him on his journey. He can also run into rooms where mythological figures like the boulder-rolling Sisyphus and the tragic nymph Eurydice await to speak with and aid him as well. Even the bosses in Hades are characters with ongoing narrative with the prince each time he meets them. And perhaps even more interesting is that the narrative with all of these characters can sometimes depend on whether you’ve defeated them, been killed by them, brought a certain weapon with you, taken the aid of a certain deity, and more. It all comes together to make Hades one of the most story-rich roguelikes I have ever seen, and often satisfying even in my continuous bouts of dying and trying again.It has to be said that this is all set to Supergiant Games’ arguably best soundtrack yet. Composer Darren Korb has put together an awesome arrangement of music that adapts to the players situation, feels mellow or chill when it needs to be, and hair-raising intense and dramatic when in the throes of a battle to the death. It moves back and forth between these situations well and also features some haunting lyrical melodies set to unique situations. Supergiant Games have always had good music and Hades’ soundtrack is no exceptionStory-hefty nature aside, Hades is still functionally a roguelike. What that means is that you’ll go through a randomized series of rooms on your way to a boss fight in a region before moving up to the next region. Each room has a different reward associated with it that you’ll gain if you defeat its conditions (or its just a lucky room with no danger). These rewards will be seen in orbs over the doors leading to that room for you to strategically choose. They can be upgrades for your weapon, messages and aid from a certain god (called boons), upgrades for your godly boons, dark gems to boost Zagreus’ stats, coins to spend at a shop run by Charon, and more.The boons and weapon upgrades are probably the most important. There are up to six different weapons you can unlock in the game, but you can only take one with you when you begin a run. Daedalus Hammers are the weapon upgrades and they offer you a choice of bonuses, such as making the Stygian Blade break armor faster with its regular attack or making the Aegis shield bounce between and hit targets when thrown before returning. Each weapon has a large list of upgrades that can come from the Daedalus Hammer to make it more versatile.Much like the Daedalus Hammer and the various weapons, each god found in your journey has a series of power-ups associated with them if you find their messages. For instance, Poseidon’s boons can grant water powers that knock enemies away or increase your treasures where Athena’s boons will grant defensive traits such as resistance to damage or reflecting attacks back at enemies.Each boon will be associated with your basic attack, special attack, projectile, or dash, or a passive that affects them all, and mix and matching the gods’ abilities with those of your weapon upgrades makes for countless possibilities that can lead to easier conquests out of Hades’ domain. I tended to enjoy the Aegis shield or Varatha spear with Ares’ Doom boons, which cause enemies to take a burst of damage shortly after being attacked and marked, mixed with a projectile reflection dash from Athena, and a chained lightning projectile attack from Zeus. That said, there’s also a degree of randomness to it, you take what you can get from the choices you’re given, and there are a ton of viable combinations to explore.As a roguelike, many players should know there is a certain level of difficulty associated with a game like Hades. If you lose, you don’t just go back to a checkpoint. You go back to the very start of the journey, meaning if you made it to the final boss (which can take about 30 to 50 minutes to do) and fall right at the finish line… tough luck, chump. Go back to the beginning. The advancing narrative as you go makes it easier to deal with, but it can still be frustrating to start all over again. At the same time, you get stronger constantly and the journey becomes naturally easier with enough runs. In this regard, Supergiant Games adds something that I highly appreciate and many other players will too: options to both soften and toughen the difficulty of the game.Hades has a God Mode that makes the game easier and a Hell Mode that makes the game harder. God Mode isn’t what you might think from something like Doom. It doesn’t make you invincible because then you would miss out on a lot of Hades’ narrative. Instead, every time you die, the game adds a stack of damage resistance to Zagreus that makes enemy attacks hit a little less hard each time. Die enough, and they’ll be barely scratching you where they once maimed you, making for an altogether easier run. God Mode can also be toggled off and on at any time through a normal save, allowing you to use it at your leisure.Conversely, Hell Mode makes use of the Pact of Punishment that can be gained after players defeat a run. In normal games, the Pact of Punishment can be used to set different conditions like enemies doing more damage, making more enemies appear, and raising the prices of Charon’s shop, with the benefit of better rewards. In Hell Mode, the Pact of Punishment is available from the start and there are difficulties selected from the list that are mandatory, including one unique to Hell Mode that removes the temporary damage invincibility upon being hit, essentially allowing Zagreus to be struck again immediately. A Hell Mode save also disables the ability to activate God Mode, which is smart and cheeky. Where Pact of Punishment is cool as a new game plus, it’s also cool that players looking for a challenge can go all-in with Hell Mode from the get-go.Hades is another banger from Supergiant Games. That’s a fact. Throughout the entire journey there was little I could find to be mad at other than failing in my quest close to the finish line or getting a bad combination of power-ups that didn't work well together, but God Mode was there for me to soften the quest if I so desired. The game’s performance slowed a bit in rooms where there were a lot of enemies at once, but otherwise it was buttery smooth throughout. The mix of boons and upgrades provides delightful flexibility, the advancing and adapting narrative upon dying or succeeding keeps things interesting throughout, and the soundtrack is something I will continue to listen to inside and outside the game for just how ridiculously good it is. Whether you’re looking for a challenging action game or just want to enjoy a beautifully illustrated and orchestrated story, Hades might be my preferred recommendation for romps through Hell.This review was based on a digital Nintendo Switch copy provided by the publisher.

					TJ Denzer posted a new article, Hades review: Godlike roguelike 
					I feel REALLY broken.I absolutely love the genre but could never get into this game 				
					At least you still have DQ11				
					Man I love that game, but I think I'm over the combat, 55 hours of it is all I can takeI ended at a grind wall, requiring 2-3 hours of level grinding to beat a boss, nope. Maybe I'll dive back in next year. 				
					I am currently at such a wall myself and set it down. I don't like feeling obligated to play a game 				
					did you try it when it hit 1.0? because playing an early access vs a 1.0 is a massive difference...				
					I think so, I played it earlier this year 				
					Hades v1.0 actually only just hit recently on September 17. It's been in Early Access for most of this year.				
					Woops thought we were talking about DQ haha! Maybe I should give it another shot 				
					bro 1.0 just came out, right when it came out on switch. like 1 or 2 weeks ago				
					The experience is not going to be much different from when you played. It’s even more polished than it already was and they added lots of stuff but it’s basically the same as it was in January. 				
					[deleted]				
					Hmmm  				
					I read that as Godzilla roguelike and hopped that fuckin' link. Nope. This is not what I came to find.				
					My apologies. There are, unfortunately, no iconic kaiju in this roguelike action game about Greek mythology. Maybe in the DLC...				
					As long as they have Megan, I'm set				
					Fuck, Negan. Thanks autocorrect				
					I suddenly want to plot my trek through America getting Godzilla upgrades and smashing Trump/Maralago! Make it realistic with current conditions, some wear masks some dont. 				
					Trying to sus out information about this game without going directly to videos, screens, etc.so I can kind of go into it as a surprise. If I loved Dead Cells will I like this game too? 				
					Absolutely yes.				
					I had a quick run this morning and it is incredible, can't wait to play more.				"
God is a Geek,"August 10, 2021At this point, me reviewing Hades is just me finding new ways to tell you it’s one of the best games of the last five years. Or ten years. Or maybe all the years. If you haven’t played it yet on PC or Nintendo Switch, you’re in for a treat.The PS5 version of Supergiant Game’s seminal roguelite is almost identical to the PC version. It runs at a buttery smooth 60fps, and sings in 4K. It’s mix of colours and lighting is gorgeous, rendering the many realms of the Greek Underworld in vivid detail.It tells the tale of Zagreus, son of the titular Hades, through his multiple attempts to escape the Underworld and reach Mount Olympus. And it’s a tale well-told, despite the roguelite setup. The Greek Pantheon are more than willing to help him ascend. From Zeus and Poseidon to Aphrodite, Athena and Ares, they all show up from time to time to offer boons.CHECK THIS OUT: Is Back 4 Blood the co-op zombie shooter we’ve been waiting for?Each area is divided into rooms, and when you clear a room, you’re rewarded. Sometimes that might be with coins to spend at Charon’s shop, or Poms of Power to increase an equipped boon. You might receive a health bar extension, or shadow crystals to purchase permanent power-ups in Zagreus’ bedroom. Sometimes, though, you’ll invoke one of the Olympean deities. These colourful character not only bestow buffs and modifiers based on their creed, but also offer to answer the Call.While each modifier is a powerful bonus (Zeus, for example, will bestow your attacks with lightning damage), the Call allows you to briefly summon a deity to help you in a fight. They can be absolute lifesavers, especially during boss fights. There’s a surprising heart to the writing here too, and the line delivery is bursting with personality. Particularly Zagreus, whose flat, deadpan tone is shamelessly compelling.Weapons and permanent buffs are unlocked with Cthonic Keys, also earned as rewards for clearing rooms. While you begin with Zagreus’ trusty broadsword, you’ll soon unlock a spear, shield, bow, and a handful of other weapons. Each begins with a base attack and special attack, but all can be upgraded and modified with the aforementioned boons.CHECK THIS OUT: Is Halo Still relevant in 2021?Now and then you’ll find Nectar, which can be gifted to various NPCs in exchange for Keepsakes. These are equipped pre-run, or later between rooms, and offer benefits such as increased backstab damage or a starting bonus of cash to spend. There’s so much to earn and unlock that you’ll always feel like you’re making progress, even when you die. And if you activate “God Mode” in options, you’ll receive a bonus to damage reduction when you fail a run, ensuring that it gets fractionally easier each time.Where Hades excels among other roguelites is in its sense of identity. It feels unique, and the world it builds feels real. Because the story continues even when you fail, there’s a true sense that the world exists with or without your agency. Yes, you can spend jewels to upgrade and modify Hades’ greathall, or add altars and resource nodes to runs, but it’s not all about moving forward. Characters move around between runs, they have conversations that hint at hidden agendas, and freely impart wisdom to Zagreus.Hades is exceptional, and the more you play it, the more you love it. If there’s a complaint to be made, it’s that there’s no new content in the PS5 version. But what’s here is already awesome. Millimetre-perfect combat, responsive controls, stunning visuals and fantastic music combine to create a truly world-beating experience. If you haven’t had the pleasure of playing it yet, you owe it to yourself to give it a go on PlayStation 5 or Xbox.Runs beautifully
Incredible campaign
Effortlessly charming

Attack of the Fanboy,"There’s not much that can be said about Hades at this point that hasn’t been said.  Last year, Supergiant’s Hades came out of early access to critical acclaim, rocketing up many game of the year lists to close out the 2020 and it was well deserved praise.  While Supergiant has carved out a niche for themselves with their highly stylized isometric titles, the developer seems to have taken the lessons learned from Bastion, Transistor, and Pyre to put forth their best effort yet with Hades.A rouge-like dungeon crawling ARPG, Hades is a breath of fresh air for a genre that has been well tread over the last few years.  The marks of a near perfect game, Hades excels in just about every area: Gameplay, Art Style, Music, Presentation… the game is teeming with personality and style and it’s just a lot of fun to play.Supergiant takes lessons learned from previous games to put forth their best effort yetWhile last year’s release was limited to the PC and Switch, Hades is finally making it’s way to the PlayStation and Xbox consoles, while also debuting to a massive audience on Game Pass.  The good news is that Hades hasn’t changed all that much in this release.  It has translated over to the new consoles with little lost to the naked eye.  In fact, if just for the matter of convenience, Hades was a blast to dig back into on my PlayStation 5 on my big screen. If you like rogue likes, you don’t need to read much further.  Hades is a near perfect example of this type of game.  It’s hard to imagine anyone who enjoys this type of experience to turn away unsatisfied with Hades.You play as Zagreus the defiant son of Hades who wants out of the Underworld.For those who want a bit more, Hades is as described previously an action role playing game set within the constraints of a rogue-like formula.  Like modern games in this genre there are plenty of persistent upgrades that’ll keep you playing, but each run is one which you can “beat” the game using the random power-ups and abilities that are thrown at you during said run.  The persistent abilities and unlocks that you earn over time will make things a little easier.In Hades you play as Zagreus, the prince of the Underworld and the defiant son of Hades.  His quest is to leave the underworld at the dismay of his father, in search of his mother Persephone.  Along the way, Zagreus is aided by the Olympians who offer him powerful boons that allow him to fight through four levels of the underworld.  Like other games by Supergiant, this is an isometric title.  Each room that Zagreus clears offers him distinct benefits for doing so, whether that’s power-ups from the Olympians, currency to purchase items to help, or persistent items that can be spent on upgrades that allow for Zagreus to grow stronger.  Each level is end-capped by a powerful boss.  Fighting your way to the surface is your goal and to do so you’ll need to face four distinctly challenging levels and said bosses who roadblock that progress.  Zagreus has a slew of unlockable weapons that he can use to take on this challenge.While it doesn’t sound much different than many others rogue-like titles, Hades most certainly feels different when you dig in.  Unlike many games of this type, Supergiant succeeds in presenting a compelling narrative and an interesting cast of characters.  Something that is often missing in games of this type.  Each time that Zagreus fails in his attempt to make it to Greece, he’ll have the opportunity to build relationships with the many underworld inhabitants.  Nyx, Achilles, Medusa, and more will be there to lend there advice to Zagreus on his quest.  Build said relationships and you’ll earn powerful keepsake items that help you on your quest.  It’s a tale that’s masterfully told by Supergiant.  The relationship between Zagreus and his father, the Olympians and the inhabitants of the underworld is one that shows a level of dysfunction that is hardly represented in the source material and lends a level of a relatability to the cast of characters.  Never have we seen a rogue-like game with such a strong narrative base as we see with Hades.The compelling narrative of Hades is not often seen in other rogue-likesAnd it’s backed up in the gameplay department as well.  Hades is as enjoyable a dungeon crawler as any.  While it may feel a bit mashy if you get lucky enough to build one of the game’s many OP builds, for the most part the combat is both challenging and fun.  Most rooms have branching paths which allow you to pick up different upgrades for your character so no run ever really feels the same.  There are a number of Olympians that offer Boons to Zagreus and builds can go in any number of directions on any given run.  That’s part of the fun of Hades.  It’s a “what will I get this time” sort of game.  There’s plenty of games like this, but some of them just aren’t that fun when you don’t get decent weapons or abilities.  With Hades, you can pick a weapon that you like at the start and then build around that weapon.  Over the long haul you can unlock special power-ups for said weapons, and if you really dig into the game you can unlock hidden upgrades and attributes for each weapon by fostering your relationships with the cast of characters in this game.  Hades is good built on good, built on good.  From the core gameplay to the narrative, to the unlockables, modifiers and more… everything feels organically implemented for you to unlock and unfold.  While most rogue-like titles have zero pacing, Hades has this incredible pace to the game that always feels like you’re working towards something.  And it’s almost always more than a feeling.  As you get stronger, you can’t help but make it further and further on your journey.Supergiant has always been known for their incredible attention to the small details of their games and they’ve haven’t yet released a game yet that hasn’t had both a rocking soundtrack and stellar voice cast.  Hades is no different. Once again, the cast of characters who voice this dysfunctional underworld family are incredible and the music is once again a high point for the experience.  The level design and art style make this world come to life in a way that you just haven’t experienced in this Greek mythos before.  The tales and the characters are familiar for any that have delved into Greek mythology, but the way that they are introduced to the player are in such a way that make the content feel fresh.  Hades puts many games to shame, frankly.  Big or small.  There are just so many small details that are there simply to hammer home that artisanal feel.  Hades feels like it was made with loving care for each and every aspect of it.Look, if you have Game Pass this should be the first thing you play the moment it releases.  The amount of enjoyment that you’re likely going to get out of it is going to cover at least a month of your subscription to the service.  That said, Game Pass or not, Hades is a game that you just shouldn’t miss.  Whatever you like games for, graphics, gameplay, fun factor, it’s got this all in spades with equally exceptional quality wherever you choose to play it. If Hades got past you last year for whatever reason, don’t let it get by you again.

Attack of the Fanboy / GAME REVIEWS / Hades Review"
God is a Geek,"September 17, 2020One of the main reasons Hades stands head and shoulders above many other roguelite action-RPGs is the progression system. Yes, it’s a hard game – rage-inducingly so, at times – but it balances that with a constant sense of progression and achievement that newer, more modern roguelites overlook or deliberately ignore. Like Dead Cells, Hades rewards you for failure, encouraging you to go back for that one-more-try, because it might be the one that leads to you unlocking a new weapon or power up that makes the next run easier or, at least, different.It doesn’t have the same variety of weaponry and gear as some of its peers, but Hades offers a unique weapon upgrade system that always feels worth pursuing but still resets with each run. Of course, it helps to be reviewing the 1.0 version of a title that has been in early access for several years. Hades has been consistently worked on, tweaked and refined by Supergiant Games, a developer who already had immense pedigree from the success of Transistor and Bastion, and the result is a title that may be easier to get to grips with, but is no less complex or challenging in the long run.Having proved a success on PC, Hades is finally moving over to the Nintendo Switch, a platform that seems almost custom built for titles like it. An isometric dungeon crawler, Hades casts you as Zagreus, the son of the titular god, as he attempts to escape the Underworld and reach Mount Olympus, where the rest of the Greek Pantheon awaits him. But it’s not that simple, and reaching Olympus is the test for entry, as all the horrors of the Underworld stand in his path.An interesting, surprisingly intricate plot is weaved between repeated delves into the netherrrealm, and sees Zagreus uncover godly conspiracies and unravel a web of lies about his heritage. The other gods, Zeus, Poseidon, Artemis, Athena, Ares, Hermes and Dionysius make an appearance throughout each run, offering power-ups and boons that increase your stats and attack power, or add special elemental effects to your attacks. Each seems more than happy to help Zagreus ascend, but some have motives of their own.The story progresses even through your failures, with new story beats and interactions occurring even when you don’t feel like you’re getting anywhere, and items you take out of the Dungeons, even on death, help to improve your fortunes in future runs. Some of them simply allow you to upgrade Hades’ Palace with new furnishings, rooms and items that serve little purpose beyond the cosmetic.Each run is broken into a series of rooms filled with enemies to defeat. When everything is dead, you’ll be presented with a door showing the rewards for the next room. For example, keys are used to unlock new weapons and buffs, Pomegranates (Poms) of Power boost a weapons skill, coins indicate a meeting with the ferryman Charon, who operates as a merchant. You can also earn HP increases and collect Darkness essence which is used as a currency to apply buffs between runs.If a door shows the symbol of a specific god, you can expect a bonus related to that god. For example, Ares increases melee damage or adds effects to those attacks, while Hermes increases attack speeds and your Dash moves. It’s an interesting system that keeps your buffs and boosts consistent yet still randomised. Sometimes you’ll need to choose between several gods, and the one you don’t pick will take offence, offering fewer or less effective buffs next time.It sounds obvious but the combat is the star of the show in Hades. There’s a variety of weapons to choose from, including the starting broadsword, a spear with a long reach, a bow, and a shield you can bash enemies with or throw. Each weapon had a primary and secondary attack that can be upgraded during the run, but which reset on death. You also have a dash move for evading danger, and a ranged attack that you can imbue with various properties like your weapons. Combat is fast and responsive, and feels as rewarding on the Switch as it does on PC. The final kill in a room will always hit in slow motion right before the reward appears with a pop! and it’s insanely satisfying every time.With a mix of melee and ranged enemies, some that drop mines or throw bombs, others still that fire lasers or can jump across the map, you’ll be forced to learn the intricacies of each weapon to survive. Thankfully Hades tends not to overly punish you for death. Not only are there buffs and items you can equip to grant second or even third lives, but you get plenty of chances to refill your HP or earn currencies for permanent improvements. And besides, Zagreus himself is just a joy to play as.His sharp wit and quick tongue have been honed by a lot of updates, and he has an answer or comment for every eventuality. When he crawls out of the mire at the start of each new run he’ll complain about the enemy it boss that killed him or the area he died in, and he responds to power-ups or events in each dungeon with little asides and subtle quips. His demeanour is dry and somewhat aloof, but it’s entertaining, and his relationships with the other gods – even the mysterious Chaos god who shows up now and then with double-edged gifts – are well written and often funny. Oh, and giving them gifts you find during your runs allows you to explore their individual stories, leading to special events specific to each God – as well as giving you a few extra items to equip for bonuses during subsequent escape attempts. Get really friendly and they’ll let you summon them during fights for devastating damage.Characters you find in and out of the Dungeons can help too, giving you gear and services – and in exchange for gifts they may give you items to equip, all of which can also be upgraded. You’ll only be able to equip one at a time though, so choose wisely. At a glance, Hades build system seems simple, but there’s immense depth to it if you can survive long enough.The version on Switch is up to date with all the updates and additions on PC so far. With Version 1.0 launching on Steam and the Epic Store, there’s a bunch of new stuff including a new Claw-class weapon and various tweaks to boss behaviour and, notably, the endgame. Having not spent a lot of time with Hades on PC it’s hard to comment too much on the effect of these changes, but as a whole Version 1.0 of Hades is a fantastic experience on PC or Nintendo Switch.Add to this the incredible score, so subtle you won’t even notice that you’re nodding your head or tapping your feet while slashing monsters into pieces, and the gorgeous art style that almost feels “typically Supergiant” and it’s not hard to see why Hades is universally praised. The Nintendo Switch version is not noticeably downgraded when played handheld, but you can see it when the Switch is docked. It’s not quite as sharp, and the framerate isn’t quite as smooth, but really you lose nothing in the incredible gameplay.With cross save, players who usually play on PC can carry on their adventures on the Switch, which is a fantastic addition on top of everything else. If anything, it would be nice to have the option to increase text size or zoom the screen on the Switch, as the action can happen fast and it’s not always easy to track in handheld.There’s a wonderful lightheartedness to a lot of Hades that can, every now and then, take a darker turn. The atmosphere is on point, the music is excellent, and the gameplay itself is incredibly satisfying. For a roguelite it’s surprisingly giving in terms of buffs, progression, and player aids, which will make it much more accessible for newcomers. While the Switch version doesn’t utilise the touchscreen controls or offer anything “new” that the PC version doesn’t, it’s still absolutely worth grabbing if you have the chance. Utterly addictive and endlessly playable, with a late game element that will keep you coming back for a very long time, Hades is simply one of the best and most likeable roguelites available on PC or Nintendo Switch.Superb combat

Attack of the Fanboy,"Supergiant Games is known for creating amazing narrative-driven adventures, so when they first announced they were making a roguelike, an early access roguelike no less, I was skeptical. Roguelikes have told decent stories in the past, but I didn’t think the Supergiant style of storytelling would work well in a roguelike setting. Hades proved me wrong. Now that the game is out of early access and finally complete, Hades is one of Supergiant’s best works. Not only do the roguelike elements keep the combat feeling fresh for dozens of hours, but they also tie into the narrative in surprising ways and make the story much more compelling as a result. Hades is one of the best roguelikes I’ve played in a long time, and I can’t wait to jump back in and see what else the game has in store.You play as Zagreus, Prince of the Underworld, who is hell-bent on running away from home to join the Gods on Mount Olympus. The only problem is that Zagreus’ father, the titular Hades, does not approve of his escape, so he must fight his way through Hades’ domain in order to get out. Hades is a dangerous place, so Zagreus faces death again and again, hoping to get lucky at least once. As you reach higher levels of Hades, you’ll learn more about Zagreus and his relationship with his father and the other residents of the House of Hades. These character relationships and Zagreus’ mysterious motivations are at the core of the game, which is odd for a roguelike. There is still plenty of action packed combat and randomized items to pursue, but Hades places equal emphasis on fleshing out its characters and world. Its heavy focus on story places Hades in a unique position within the genre, making it a refreshing change of pace right from the start.Supergiant’s transition to the roguelike genre is more than just a gameplay change. The repetition and randomness that permeate the genre are used to tell Hades’ story, and it makes this mythological tale all the more engaging. In Hades, death is a plot device. Zagreus is determined to escape the House of Hades no matter how many times his endeavors may kill him, and he reawakens in Hades’ domain each time you fail a run. His numerous deaths start to wear on him and those around him, and death is one of the driving forces behind the game’s story.The random items and bonuses you obtain during runs are also explained within the context of the story. The Gods of Mount Olympus see Zagreus as family and want to aid him on his quest, so they send all sorts of boons to the underworld to support him. These boons come with dialogue and story tidbits, which add an extra layer of uniqueness to the buffs they provide and make them feel like more than just numbers and percentages. Rather than having the gameplay and story exist on two separate planes, Hades’ gameplay and story are interwoven to the benefit of both departments. Many were skeptical of Supergiant making a roguelike when this game was first announced, but now it is clear that Hades could not have been anything other than a roguelike.In Hades, death is a plot device.If you normally bounce off of roguelikes, then Hades could be the one you fall in love with. The disheartening defeats of those first few runs are offset by charming characters and a desire to see the story through to the end. In the beginning, failure comes frequently and death comes swiftly, but you don’t feel as bad about it because you get to check back in with Achilles, Nyx, and the rest of the gang before you brave the depths of Tartarus once more. It’s not just the friendly faces that keep you going, either. Hypnos will tease you regularly and your father Hades does not take kindly to your multiple escape attempts. It’s the perfect blend of positive reinforcement and snide remarks that make you want to keep going on your seemingly futile quest. When you add new weapon unlocks and other upgrades on top of that, death transforms from a frustrating punishment to a promising opportunity to grow stronger. There are enough elements pulled from Supergiant’s other games that if you’re a fan of the developer, you should absolutely check this game out even if you’re not into roguelikes.Combat is fast and frenetic. It starts out simple, but the basic hacking and slashing at the core of Hades actually has a surprising amount of depth. You have a dash, a light attack, a heavy special attack, and a ranged cast attack. What separates Hades from other action games like it is its focus on positioning. Attacks from behind deal bonus damage, and the amount of bonus damage increases as Zagreus grows stronger, further incentivizing you to use your dash to flank your foes. Knocking enemies into walls is another core aspect of Hades, and learning to incorporate this into your playstyle can greatly increase your damage output. There are also traps scattered throughout the game’s arenas, and while you’ll accidentally stumble onto pressure plates and trigger spike traps all the time during your first few runs, you’ll eventually learn to use them to your advantage, adding yet another layer onto an already complex combat system.What separates Hades from other action games like it is its focus on positioning.There are multiple weapons to learn and master, but most of the combat variety comes from the many different boons and items you can acquire during runs. Boons are acquired at a steady pace throughout a run, but the ones you get are random each time. Boons from each God are centered around different things, and you’ll quickly learn which Gods fit your playstyle and which you’ll want to avoid. Zeus’ boons cause your attacks to chain lightning to nearby foes, for example, while Artemis’ boons focus more on critical damage. Mixing and matching different boons can result in some borderline broken builds. I was able to get through the entire second area and most of the third area on one of my earlier runs just because I had a ridiculous set of boons and upgrades. Each run in Hades feels very different from the last.On PC, the game’s beautiful art style really shines. The game doesn’t take much power to run and is incredibly optimized, so you can easily bump up the resolution and framerate if you have a fancy display. At both high resolutions and high framerates, Hades is absolutely stunning. The hand-drawn backgrounds and character portraits are gorgeous and the game never fails to be a joy to look at. On Nintendo Switch, the game holds close to it’s 60 FPS target at native resolution, but will slow down during effect heavy battles with multiple enemies. It never becomes unplayable, but it can make death during those rare moments feel cheap. A little more work can be done, but like Dead Cells at launch, the performance on Switch is not enough to completely detract from an otherwise outstanding experience.Hades is an excellent roguelike that appeals to both fans of the genre and newcomers alike. Roguelike veterans will appreciate the combat’s breakneck pace and the replayability offered by the randomized boons and items, while newcomers will have several charming characters and an interesting story to keep them going between runs. Of course, it’s difficult to tell if the game has staying power this soon after launch. Only time will tell if Hades joins the pantheon of roguelike greats alongside The Binding of Isaac and Dead Cells, but it makes an incredibly strong impression. Hades succeeds as both a narrative-driven adventure and an addicting roguelike, and that’s a pretty tough combination to pull off.
