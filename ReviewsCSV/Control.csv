Eurogamer,"Out-of-office experience.It spoils nothing, I hope, to reduce a game as luxurious and uncanny as Control to just four words. Here goes, then: Hell is an office. Remedy's latest takes place inside the Oldest House, the austere, echoing and inhumanly vast headquarters of the Federal Bureau of Control. The FBC is an agency that deals with unusual horrors and is, as of your arrival, in the process of being overwhelmed by them. Unusual horrors are not actually that unusual in games, though, so the peculiar genius of Control is that its oddness often lurks in its workaday setting rather than the many dizzying glimpses into the void on offer. There is something wonderfully perverse about so many of the things I marvelled at in Control. Sure, here is a magical winter forest growing out of an old storage room, but look at how convincingly placed these snowfalls of Post-it notes are! I can throw desk chairs around with my mind, which is great, but it's so much better when one of the desk chairs in question hits a wall of filing cabinets and the doors of the cabinets ripple, woozily, outwards and away from the point of impact! That I could watch pretty much forever.This blend of the paranormal and the clerical works so well because offices are weird already. Testify! What are offices if not places where ill-matched strangers come together in the name of some nebulous and often deeply abstracted common cause? Offices are filled with monstera deliciosa and water coolers, but they are also filled with grudges and arcane rituals and human secrets and mysteries. Certain phrases act like incantations in offices:  we've-always-done-it-this-way-that's-why and only-Henry-knows-how-to-make-copies-on-both-sides-of-the-page-and-he's-off-today. Meanwhile, in a large company, computer systems often grant certain users powers over their fellow humans that may make them akin to a god, or at least something that hovers in the mind and shines brightly and leaves everyone else a bit nervous. You can raise invoices?! And sign off expenses?! Yes, Control is committed to the Fortean side of pseudo-history. It's a bit like Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy, as you cause havoc with your telekinetic powers. But it's also a bit like Who Moved My Cheese, the polite modern fable regarding the best approach to dealing with operational change in complex organisations. And in the mingling of these two things something pretty special happens.There's plenty of story, but this is a mood piece at heart. Anyway, I am going to spoil as little of this stuff as I can. Know only this: you arrive at the Oldest House on a mission of great personal importance, but you quickly discover that the place is a bit of a state. Things run amok, the FBC's leader appears to be dead and everyone who's still alive seems to think only you have what is needed to take over at the top. Hey, have this magical gun that can morph between different modes and generates its own ammo! Here come the hordes! Briskly, the pieces are arranged for an obligingly straight-ahead blaster mounted in the most ornate of frames. And Control delivers.Let's start with that frame, because the location's an enduring delight and the main source of Control's considerable appeal. Even before things get properly strange, The Oldest House is a marvel, a Masonic temple of the mid-century modern. The whole place is equal parts Barbican Centre and plate glass University. Hallways echo. Floors are glossy and perform gorgeous puddle-effects with the simple click-clack of a heel. Concrete looks like concrete and wood looks like wood. Atriums are so roomy they feel distinctly troubling, like negative-space Mayan temples. You always feel stuck deep, deep underground, in the Oldest House, cut off and dizzy from the sheer weight of implied darkness that is massed overhead.References matter in any office job, of course, and Control has the best. It has taken a leaf or two from House of Leaves. It has spent time in the basement with Escher and Schiele. And it has lots of Kubrick on the CV. The lighting and volumes are plucked from Dr Strangelove, with blinding overhead illumination giving nearby geometric forms a sharp-edged blackness, while distant areas dither into smokey shadow. The carpeting is fresh from the Overlook. Even 2001 gets a nod, and let us say no more of that here. (Remedy has always been one for the nods and the in-jokes, but Control suggests a finer balance than normal in this regard. We are a long way from Alan Wake, in other words, which begins with something like, ""Stephen King once wrote..."", and so an arrogant novelist has given his first line away to another novelist, which always felt rather unlikely.)The world is big and you are small, and wonderfully there's no BioShock golden arrow or on-screen waypoint to tell you where to go as the missions send you from one department to the next. Instead, you have to read the environment, follow signs, and find your own way. It's first day of the job territory, and you slept through the orientation. It helps here that, underneath the Cthulian horror spilling forth and pooling, Control's darkest shame is extreme neatness. This is secretly a very tidy game, with a central hub linked to the rest of the complex by a single elevator. And it helps that as you progress you open up control points that allow you to heal and restock and upgrade and fast-travel between nodes. But still, it's genuinely wonderful whenever you take a wrong turn on your way somewhere and feel a very real-world panic set in. I'm a little bit lost, aren't I? Everywhere is well signposted - the signs themselves add a great deal of character to the place: Luck & Probability Labs, Ritual Division - but it's still nice for a game to leave getting where you want to go up to you.(Yes, this does mean there's a bit of backtracking involved, incidentally, and occasionally a difficulty spike will leave you some distance from a respawn point. This is annoying! But I wonder if it's also just a consequence of what Control is trying to do: give you a world that is daunting, that feels strange but also real and governed by its own inscrutable rules, and in which you have to pay attention to where you are. So much of what the game is conjuring would be weakened, I reckon, if the team made it a little more spatially forgiving. Control exerts control.)The Oldest House is a knife-edge construction, in other words. Its scope is the scope of myth, but its detailing speaks to the homely old 9-5 toil of an earlier generation, walls of punch cards and rows of desks, elevators, as the poet said, to drop us from our day. It's spooky even before it starts to change. But the more you push forward, the more the world begins to shift and recalibrate itself around you.It's beautifully done. Down in the basement the office plants have escaped from their polite concrete sarcophagi and have started to reclaim the walls and ceiling, making a swamp of the floor. Employees dangle in mid-air, arms limp and heads bowed. Further south a furnace room is home to a gaping mouth of flame that is so bright, so overwhelmingly yellow, that it was a relief to get out of there. My skin seemed to tingle. It is Moloch's realm: wordlessly I understood this. Elsewhere, a bottleneck of baddies will stain the air a Marnie red and, once they're cleared, the walls will Rubik's Cube themselves about a bit, opening out the space, one world reclaiming another, rejecting another. This is a kind of concrete that has tides, it seems. It advances and retreats, and it is a reliable pleasure to watch it move.It's a world of finishings as well as scale. Along with those signs pointing to departments like Para-kinesiology, there are rooms of antique lab equipment and there are sextants gleaming in display cases. There's acoustic tile, coal seams, old AV equipment like reel-to-reels and projectors, rooms of plastic stacking chairs politely gathered around a yellowing screen and an OHP. All of this adds up. The Oldest House creates a cumulative sense of the dangerous wonders of research, of the dark side of curiosity. And this is all the more powerful for being delivered largely straight. There are funny moments in Control - and if you dig deep in the collectables you will discover some excellent fancies - but on the very top layer there are few tedious jokes about the jaunty paradoxes of corporate life booming from every speaker, and on the walls there are oil paintings depicting darkly studious former employees, a smug hierarchy, rather than lame riffs on motivational posters. You get a sense of a wayward and addled heritage rather than a bunch of threadbare stand-up routines telling you how lame it is to have to wear a tie every day. And anyway, you don't need that kind of stuff to make a game playful when you can kill someone with a photocopier or a lunch bench, or when you can send blizzards of paper raffling through the air just by looking at them. Control's obvious delight in - and stubborn defence of - its own fictions is completely intoxicating.Speaking of killing people with photocopiers, the bulk of what you actually do in the Oldest House orbits around combat. And combat, I will be honest, took a while to click with me. There was a sense, in some early battles, that Control might simply have too much taste and poise to let itself go. The rooms seemed too big, the threats too small. It was like a diorama of fun rather than the real thing.I shouldn't have worried. As you level up and get used to your abilities, and as the game's particular thrills seep into your marrow, Control's battles become truly hilarious. And they're built from such simple pieces. Control has a handful of different enemy types and as the game progresses it often just throws them together in new configurations. There are basic weapon grunts, flocking in hallways, gathering in corners. But they are soon joined by ragged floaty guys who explode, floaty guys who lob things, ground-based guys who lob lots of things, icy weirdos who... These things warp in with streaks of red light and expire in spectrum blurs that bring to mind the sickly rainbows of a migraine aura. At its best, Control chucks threats at you that have real style. I'm particularly fond of a large glassy sphere rimmed in colourful light that gives off health buffs as it zips around and always makes me feel I am shooting at old Gary Numan cover art. Elsewhere, though, the visual design of the baddies cannot match the Oldest House. In terms of whittling these guys down, one of Control's central gimmicks is a single gun - the Service Weapon - that can become many guns over the course of the game, shifting and recombining in your hand to move between machine pistol, shotgun, charged sniper shot, rocket launcher. Besides unlocking new forms for the gun you can also collect and add mods - you can mod yourself too - which flare each build in specific directions. It's fun enough, and the crafting resources have brilliant names: Undefined Reading, Corrupted Sample. Excellent sound design complements the Service Weapon's modular, voxely form, but in truth your best weapons are the kind of thing that you can find in an old Viking catalogue anyway. This is because the gun is designed to be paired with your growing suite of supernatural powers, the first and greatest of which is Launch. God, Launch is great. It's so simple, a squeeze of the bumper grabbing an object from the nearby environment before you heft it at whoever you fancy taking out. If there's no object available, Launch doesn't mind: It will simply pull something jagged out of the ground or the walls for you and you're still off to the races.Launch is soon joined by a dash move, the ability to seize weakened enemies and have them fight alongside you, and a few other tricks that I don't want to spoil. All of these can be tweaked with their own skill trees, which generally offer incremental power boosts but chuck in the odd twist now and then. (Launch can be powered up so you can heft really big stuff, for example, or heft actual people.) And, like the Service Weapon, which offers infinite ammo but needs a recharge period after each clip, powers are, well, powered by a separate stock of recharging energy. The aim of the game, in other words, is to manage and balance these dueling cooldowns, shooting only when you can't afford to chuck anything, and vice versa. To Control's credit this never feels like clinical meter-wrangling. Rather, it encourages you to be creative, to take risks, to think improbable thoughts. The same is true of the health system, which forces you to regain health only by collecting the little pieces of blue light dropped by your enemies as you shoot them. Almost dead? The best tactic may be to charge straight into the worst of it. It all gives Control a welcome vitality, a forward momentum tinged with panic. It is not too stylish for desperation and carnage after all.When it all comes together, Control's hallways and board rooms echo with wretched joy. There is something about the chaos of throwing big things about combined with the precision of  the powers' targeting system that elevates the action. There is a special halo in nailing someone with a humidor through a distant railing, watching the bars go skewiff and the body crumble. Pillars shed their concrete under gunfire filling the environment with dust and grit. This game is the famous thick-air scene from the Matrix. It takes pains in depicting the way that things fall apart.And in the crush of it all, Control has great fun with the impedimenta of office life. It is so energising to deck a machine-gunner with a well-placed white board, or use the spidery wheel-sprout of an office chair as a spinning glaive. Form follows function, too: the retro technology that the Oldest House runs on is perfect for style and atmosphere and also perfect to simply chuck around. The look of Control - a swipe-file mixture of what's cool in interior decorating at the moment, all of which suggests that Remedy's developers are probably doing up their own homes with Ercol and whatnot as they work - plays on the carefully disorienting time-warp detailing of movies like It Follows, where people have mobile phones in their pockets but use rotary phones back at the house, and it also makes the most of the fact that the good old era of heavy tech meant that there was an awful lot of stuff to hurt people with. Nobody's wounded by a flatscreen PC monitor, but something with a bit of Bakelite to it is going to do damage that everyone's going to remember.Everything is an opportunity, in other words. It gets to you. Towards the end of the game, I chased one straggler halfway across a map just so that I could hit them with an armchair I particularly liked. Minutes later I survived an encounter simply because the physics are so bright eyed and malicious that you can nail people with an object as you pull it towards you in the first place: you can kill with concrete even before you've taken proper aim. There is something of Skate 3 to Control at these moments.And when it all gets quiet again, you're left with a strange realisation. There's a little trickery in the narrative some of the time, but Control refuses to descend into all-out mechanical weirdness for the most part. It never forgets the pleasure of being a shooter above all other things, and with a few exceptions it's more eager to hit you with full-on with architectural beauty than warp your brain with the kind of spatial shenanigans you get in something like Portal. In other words, while it invokes the dark things that lie beneath, Control's actually a peerless argument for the beauty of the surface. It revels in the peculiarly warm gloss of polished concrete, the simple and undeniable thrill of combat backed up with enthusiastic physics and animation, and the visual buzz of UI that has a stark, minimalist beauty to it. Without any shade of a slight, I would call Control a sort of coffee-table book in terms of its sheer visual flair - but for how dazzling it looks in motion as you wrench individual blocks from a stacked trolley, sending them thudding through the air, as you fling rockets back at the people who fired them at you, amber sparks glinting as they pass in and out of focus and then die away for good.

Link: www.controlgame.com ""You need to deal with that shit.""The omnipotent Finnish janitor of the Federal Bureau of Control really wants to go on vacation, but can't until I've vanquished his old nemesis, The Clog. In what we'll call the 'bottom' of The Oldest House, an impossible building in the middle of New York that's infinitely larger on the inside than the outside, The Clog takes up residence near the coolant pumps, a swirling mass of brown slop that moans like a T-rex roaring bubbles into a glass of milk. I shoot the wriggling maggot-like tendrils peeking out of the body and the hulking shit monster dissolves and disappears down the drain to the tune of a toilet flushing. It's never explained, but I like it that way. Clock in, kill a poop monster, clock out, no questions asked. Keeps the mystery alive. Control is an acrobatic third-person shooter set in an amorphous concrete dimension infested by the sanitized office culture of a 1960s-era government bureaucracy. Aside from a poo beast, you'll discover new powers and revisit areas of The Oldest House to find upgrades, secrets, and side missions, all while throwing bullets and random objects at bad guys in Remedy's best combat system yet.Remedy's taking a harder thwack at weird fiction than ever before, too. Despite a few weak characters and plot threads, the team succeeds. In Control, every conspiracy theory, ghost encounter, and alien abduction happened, just not quite for the reasons you'd expect. It's a collection of stories about seeing through the banality of everyday life, a story about language, mass media, and statecraft delivered with a dry sense of humor and no tether to reason. I still don't understand it. I don't need to. Bless this mess. A floppy disk hurls debris and office supplies at my head. A fridge levels buildings unless someone looks at it 24/7.I ran Control on the highest settings at 2560x1440 and maintained 60-90 fps depending on the complexity of the scene, but my PC is fairly juiced, so it's not the best reference point. Our complete Control performance analysis covers tons of graphics card options, with ray tracing and DLSS benchmarks as well.Jesse Faden shows up to the The Oldest House with mysterious motives, and through bizarre circumstances that also make no sense (at first), she's suddenly thrust into the role of Director of the FBC. An Object of Power, a gun called The Service Weapon, chooses her, granting her the ability to wield the weapon and traverse The Oldest House without worry that The Hiss, another unexplainable entity that's invaded the FBC and has been turning its employees into glowing red monsters, will infect her mind. Control's a doozy. I spent most of the first hours reeling with confusion, writing down acronyms and pausing to let moments sink in before moving on. Control's narrative is outright inaccessible at first, but that's exactly what Remedy is going for. I still don't know what The Hiss are, why The Service Weapon chose Jesse, why everyone's cool with taking orders from a transdimensional 'Board' that speaks in mumbles emanating from an inverted triangle and whose speech translates into multiple, parallel sentences at once. It/They are/is confusing/unknowable and that's OK/acceptable/true.Inanimate objects are imbued with godlike powers, the product of Altered World Events or strange phenomena that make up modern American folklore. The FBC visits these places and collects these objects for study in The Oldest House, the panopticon and petri dish they call home. A floppy disk hurls debris and office supplies at my head. A fridge levels buildings unless someone looks at it 24/7. I accidentally let a rubber duck loose that harasses me, barking like a demonic dog from the corner of every room I enter. Control is littered with mundane objects made fascinating and sinister, treating Jungian ideas of the collective subconscious and a touch of Baudrillard's hyperreality as the foundation for its paranormal logic. Folklore and language are the literal authors of truth. Finally, mainstream sci-fi that isn't spaceships and militarism and hot green men (love you, Thane). Jesse's story is similarly cryptic and weird, but compromised by a vapid personality and weak connections to the supporting cast. She's harboring her own mystery, one closely tied to a family life she even keeps secret from the player for some time, but her sheepish concealments keep her at a distance, while her commentary too often mirrors my own. What the hell is happening, did that stapler talk to me, ad infinitum. We're both baffled by the logic and hidden truths of the FBC and Oldest House, but those moments aren't used to give Jesse a moment to reveal who she is. Her personality never quite coalesces, though the manifold mysteries of the FBC told through confidential documents, audio logs, and FMVs do well to buoy the lack of character. A lightswitch in a Butte, Montana bungalow teleports the user to an oceanside hotel somewhere in time and space, a sort of dimensional transit station. Altered Item case files tell stories about a picnic basket that attracts woodland creatures or a surfboard that gives anyone touching it an excess of confidence. Then there's a creepy puppet TV show the bleach-brained FBC put together to introduce kids to their research, replete with lingering gazes at the camera and sinister voicework. It's horrible! I love it. The Oldest House is a fascinating setting, but Jesse's family story about shared trauma and the effects of living in a media driven world doesn't say much beyond how disorienting it is. Control is best when it uses these heady concepts about language and reality as the basis for a set of wild stories. But it ends—after a wild head trip of a sequence, of course—a little too abruptly, like it had just tee'd up those big ideas but forgot to swing. The arc doesn't feel complete or entirely fulfilling, as much fun as the ride is, though it's clearly setting up for a sequel, spinoff, or DLC somewhere in the Remedy-verse. Bring it on. OK, so why is a coral reef growing out of the wall in the maintenance sector, and why does Jesse think it smells delicious? I don't know if I'm meant to reach the high ledge where I see the ocean floor growing quite yet, but I try anyway. I round the corner and clamber up some rocks where I chain Jesse's dash ability through the air and back around the corner, where I manage to hit the wall below the ledge at just the right point. She grabs it and pulls herself up. I find enemies too powerful for my low-grade abilities and guns, so I dip out. But now I have a new mystery to solve and a good reason to shoot some Hiss for upgrade points and currency to make new astral constructs (guns).Control's shooting may be the last thing anyone will talk about after the credits roll—like I said, there's a rubber duck that harasses you—but it's Remedy's best yet.Enemies drop health where they die and Jesse is so fragile that I have to constantly push the enemy position to stay alive, Doom 2016 style. It's propped up by smart interplay between the weapon system and extremely satisfying telekinetic abilities.Jesse's telekinesis joins Half-Life 2's juiced gravity gun in the videogame physics toy hall of fame.The Service Weapon morphs between two forms of your choosing, each representing a fairly standard videogame gun archetype: pistol, shotgun, SMG, sniper, and grenade launcher. Ammo isn't a thing though, as 'magazines' are represented by energy. Empty the weapon and it'll recharge after a few seconds, a nice bit of encouragement to reposition or, better, use a telekinetic ability, which have their own recharging energy bar. It's energy bar ping-pong: shoot, use an ability, shoot, use an ability. In detail: I headshot a soldier with Shatter, leap into the air, dash up to the second floor, throw an industrial copier at the shielded guy at the back of the room, wing a few pistol shots at someone dashing between cover, summon the rubble and objects around me as a shield to take on the incoming rocket, drop the shield and grab the next rocket with telekinesis and fling into the next unlucky Hiss soldier. This one's strapped to a chair and floating around in the sky, a fellow telekinesis user. With their health low, I use mind control to turn them to my side. Telekinetic buds, tossing file cabinets around. Good times.  With a complete arsenal of abilities, I'm able to bounce around the big, multi-tiered arenas like Superman with a handgun permit. But before I found the dash and shield abilities, and before I finished enough missions to upgrade my health and energy reserves, I was too often pinned to a corner and easily overwhelmed. It doesn't take terribly long to get up to snuff, but early combat encounters are frustrating compared to what follows. When you're fully powered-up, Remedy's love of flying objects comes to the fore. The Oldest House's tidy environments are like water. Every dash sends papers flying, coffee cups crashing. Jesse can toss any object in the environment with her brain, turning banal office spaces and retro futurist underground labs into disaster areas. Levitating pulls errant objects into Jesse's orbit, like lazy little moons: staplers, rubble, pencils, printers, corpses. Max Payne would be proud. Control is a top-tier mess-making simulator. Jesse's telekinesis joins Half-Life 2's juiced gravity gun in the videogame physics toy hall of fame. But, like the story, the momentum peters out right when things come together. Chasing every skill upgrade through endgame sidequests (the credits aren't the end-end) too often climax in boss fights that are conceptually interesting but aren't fun to fight.The upgrades are too simple to feel worth chasing anyway, largely linear improvements to health, energy reserves, damage from thrown objects, how many enemies you can mind control at once, and so on. Given how playful the combat already is, I would've loved to see some comparably playful deviations in the skill tree. As it stands, it's just killing stuff to do what you already do more efficiently. Feels great, but doesn't change much.My second full lap of The Oldest House is still unearthing new discoveries, entire wings I missed at first, more Altered Items playing clever tricks, hidden bosses, secret areas, and, best of all, [REDACTED]. Control's combat is slow to start and its overarching story doesn't go far enough, but it's a gorgeous font of wonders and poop monsters and wild physics unlike anything I've played in recent memory.Control's thin protagonist and abrupt ending are propped up by an abundance of mystery, wonder, and glorious room-destroying combat. James is stuck in an endless loop, playing the Dark Souls games on repeat until Elden Ring and Silksong set him free. He's a truffle pig for indie horror and weird FPS games too, seeking out games that actively hurt to play. Otherwise he's wandering Austin, identifying mushrooms and doodling grackles. South Park makes Baldur's Gate 3 joke, Larian quickly corrects itThe Finals is a potentially incredible FPS stuck in the body of a sweaty esportOne of Alan Wake 2's expansions sounds like it's going to take us back to ControlBy Katie Wickens18 October 2023By Jacob Ridley17 October 2023By Noah Smith16 October 2023By Ian Evenden13 October 2023By Tom Hatfield12 October 2023By Harvey Randall12 October 2023By Rick Lane10 October 2023By Jorge Jimenez9 October 2023By Jacob Ridley5 October 2023By Phil Iwaniuk4 October 2023By Dave James4 October 2023PC Gamer is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Metro GameCentral,"Remedy Entertainment returns with Control – a new game that mixes their usual third person action with a strange supernatural tale and… the best Force powers ever.As far we’re concerned being weird is almost always a positive, especially when the alternative is being ordinary, predictable, or overfamiliar. And yet weirdness is in the eye of the beholder and most people have their own unique perspective on what counts as odd and what doesn’t. Which creates a problem for any game trying to sell itself as knowingly weird. Control is certainly unusual, no matter what way you look at it, but rather than the setting and storyline the most interesting thing about it is the excellent third person action.Control developer Remedy are best known as the creators of Max Payne and Alan Wake, although their most recent release was the less successful Quantum Break. Despite the varying settings all their major games have a similar style of third person action and in that sense Control is very reminiscent of Quantum Break in particular. But their previous games have also all suffered from a lack of progression in their mechanics, where the gameplay and abilities go largely unchanged from the beginning of the game to the end. But that is not a problem in Control.According to Remedy themselves, Control is inspired by the new weird genre of fiction and owes a very obvious debt to the excellent Annihilation by Alex Garland. The basic plot of Control is actually fairly straightforward though, as you play the seemingly ordinary Jesse Fade who gains entry to the Federal Bureau of Control while it’s being invaded by an interdimensional presence known as The Hiss. Before you know it she’s the new director of the agency and suddenly possessed of supernatural powers.Jesse is at the bureau in order to look for answers about her lost brother but beyond that, and the fact that’s she’s constantly talking to someone, or something, in her head, you know almost nothing about her at the beginning of the game – or for a long time after to be honest. Given the odd setting it is surprising how quickly the game runs through the initial set-up, with Jesse failing to react to anything going on around her in any kind of realistic fashion. As a result, in only a few short minutes, you’re running around the bureau’s magical headquarters in what is essentially a 3D Metroidvania.The Oldest House, as it’s called, has TARDIS like qualities in that it’s implied to be alive and seems vastly bigger than it should be, with shifting rooms and gateways to other dimensions. For most of the time though it is just a grey concrete edifice, a brutalist skyscraper filled with possessed former agents that will attack you on sight. At first you can only defend yourself with a transforming gun – that switches between what is essentially a pistol, shotgun, submachinegun, and other shooter staples – but early on you also get the ability to use telekinesis… and it is wonderful.Since you’re effectively using the Force many games have featured telekinesis in the past but never has it felt so powerful and versatile as it does here. You can pick up almost any object in the game world and throw it but if there’s nothing around you, you can just rip off a chunk of concrete from the walls or floor. This combined with some excellent destructible scenery can turn a sedate looking foyer into what looks like a bomb site within just a few minutes and it looks and feels fantastic.There are other abilities you gain along the way, such as a shield and the ability to possess enemies, although the flying you see in all the trailers comes in fairly late in the game. Abilities and weapons can be upgraded with earned loot, although Control isn’t really an action role-playing game and you don’t level up yourself except to gain extra slots for your own buffs.The timing of Control and Astral Chain this week is very odd, considering both are third person action games that feature an ‘astral plane’ made up of what looks like giant cubes of black marble. But the similarities are skin deep and the structure and gameplay of Control has a very different focus, whereas its astral plane is used as little more than a tutorial area when gaining new powers.Given the overly straightforward structure of their previous games we thought Metroidvania would be the perfect match for Remedy but somehow they’ve managed to make exploring an open-ended game world still feel surprisingly linear. What little backtracking there is to do is mostly via fast travel and while there are time-limited side quests that pop up at random their rewards are so minor, and they repeat so often, you quickly lose interest.And then there’s the question of weirdness. Your mileage may vary but to be honest we wouldn’t say Control was all that weird at all. Although there are exceptions, and things do certainly get more fantastical towards the end, most of the time you’re just running around a concrete office interior performing ordinary video game tasks like fixing generator pumps and finding key cards. Compared to anything from Super Mario Odyssey to Silent Hill the game really isn’t that strange, especially if you want to bring the surrealist oddities of Suda51 into the fight.Alan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNew Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart bundle is £50 off reveals leakTop 10 new Halloween board games and tabletop RPGs 2023That’s not necessarily a problem except when it comes to the narrative, which goes nowhere for the first two-thirds of the game and offers almost no characterisation for Jesse – which is only compensated for by the excellent voice-acting. Unlike Annihilation, which the game is so keen to pillage for its visuals, there’s little thematic depth to the game’s story and while things do get more interesting as you approach the climax it’s too little too late.The same could be said for the enemies which, for the majority of the time, are just ordinary soldiers with ordinary guns. Occasionally there’s some that fly and others that explode when they get close, but again it’s surprisingly late in the game before anything genuinely weird happens. You begin to realise that all the talk of ‘Objects of Power’ and the X-Files style background flavour is just window-dressing on a game that could’ve been about anything really.Ultimately, Control is still making the same mistakes as Quantum Break, just to a less severe degree. The action is fantastic but the context given to it – the story and the structure of the game – takes away more than it adds. With this game Remedy has perfected their particular style of third person action but they have still yet to find the perfect vehicle for it. It’s not weird that Control should still be enjoyable despite that, but it is frustrating that it isn’t the cast iron classic we were hoping for.In Short: The flawed storytelling squanders its full potential but even with a few missteps this is still one of the most enjoyable action games of the year.Pros: The gunplay and superpowers are superbly realised, with the best use of telekinesis ever in a video game. Impressive destructible scenery and some ambitious visuals.Cons: The Metroidvania structure often seems wasted and the primary setting isn’t as visually interesting as Remedy think. Underdeveloped story and characters. Too many human enemies.Score: 8/10

You might be the newly appointed director of the Federal Bureau of Control (FBC, for short), but Remedy's latest game isn't about feeling like you're on top of things. In fact, the whole reason you've found yourself at The Oldest House, the FBC headquarters, is that everything has gone – to put it bluntly – to shit. With Control, it feels like you've been dropped straight in the middle of a thrilling TV show. You know that things have happened, and there is more drama yet to come, but you're somewhere in the centre of it all, the pieces of the story floating around you like the eerily suspended corpses that haunt the hallways of the Oldest House. It's just a case of figuring out how best to bring them all together. Control walkthrough | Control tips | Control Objects of PowerRelease date: August 27, 2019

Developer: Remedy Entertainment
Publisher: 505 GamesYou play as Jesse Faden, a woman who's clearly not had the easiest life so far, but has managed to stumble across the FBC with a little help. She walks into the FBC's lobby off the streets of New York as you would with any other building. As the automated glass doors slide shut behind her, you can see the people of New York living their daily lives; a yellow taxi drives by as a couple of pedestrians wait for a bus, huddled together under the stop to take shelter from the rain. That's pretty much the last time you see anything normal in Control. Yes, there are still some unaffected members of staff that can be found hiding in rooms across The Oldest House but, as Jesse says as she walks into the mouth of the FBC, ""the room is not the world. The world is much bigger, and much stranger.""You rarely get a game setting so intriguing as The Oldest House. The lobby may look straightforward enough, akin to so many official buildings with its imposing front desk and stately lettering, but beyond that lies a twisting, turning beast that moves of its own accord. It's fighting against the invasion of a corruptive entity known as The Hiss, which is taking over the Oldest House's inhabitants and slowly infecting its concrete, Brutalist architecture and blocky, yet beautiful Bachelardian corridors. The Hiss’ presence is marked by swathes of red hues that colour both the regularly levitating, always glowing human enemies and the pulsating blocks that emerge through doorways. It's a space that's moving, changing and constantly surprising you, not to mention one that would never look out of place in an M.C Escher painting. It has a way of always drawing you back in for those ever compelling 'what's around the next corner' moments. ""You rarely get a game setting so intriguing as The Oldest House""That doesn't make it the easiest place to navigate, though, meaning you'll have to rely heavily on Control’s unhelpful in-game map - which merely shows you the general locale of your destination - or the physical signs plastered on the walls inside the building itself. There's not a waypoint in sight in Control, which only serves to add to the sense of delirious unpredictability that threads through the entire experience. Of course, that means it does come with a healthy dose of frustration, as just getting from A to B may have you retreading ground over and over again to find that one door you've missed. Regardless of its accessibility issues, The Old House makes for a truly captivating setting, acting as much as the main character of Control as Jesse is. She's your navigator, your connection to this place, but you only go where the Oldest House allows you to - you only see what it thinks you're ready to see. And even now, some 20 hours spent submerged in Control's world, I am still surprised by what I find lurking in tiny offices and behind previously locked doors – even if I am being driven slowly insane by the portion of the containment sector that I've yet to find a way into. Maybe that's exactly what The Oldest House wants. But navigating the house is only part of Control's appeal. This is a Remedy game after all, and you wouldn't be here if you weren't utterly intrigued by Control's story. And, oh boy, you're going to want to strap yourself in. It'll sound like a cliché by now, but Control is best experienced going in blind. Just know that my emotions while playing it ranged from ‘well this is weird and cool’ through to 'what the heck is happening', until a point where I literally had to stop, put down the controller and text my boyfriend to tell him this game is utterly bonkers. Beautiful, but bonkers. Remedy really wasn't messing about when it said Control was allowing it to get strange. Building mystery and intrigue is just part of Remedy's DNA, and Control feels like the studio operating at its very best. It manages to create a surreal narrative that's capable of making even the ordinary feel extraordinary, turning your standard handgun into a shapeshifting omnitool, and managing to inject life into an everyday office block. It does all that, and casually gives you one of the best gameplay experiences at the same time. Losing control is part of it, but as Jesse gains more abilities drawn from the Objects of Power, you begin to gain superhero-like status, levitating your way through The Oldest House and pulling slabs of concrete from the walls only to launch them straight into Hiss agents with the force of a freight train. Mastering all of the various abilities is an exhilarating power trip, adding to the already sky-high appeal of Control. Whether it's the tension that's expertly drawn taught across the entire length of the game, or the constant surprises you're thrown as you navigate The Oldest House, it's clear that Control is going to leave a lasting legacy on video game history. Like Alan Wake, its ability to evoke the best trippy TV shows - flowing seamlessly between combat exploration, and story - is a sight to behold, making every minute a fraught joy. It's exceptionally polished (playing on PC with an Nvidia RTX graphics card and ray-tracing is out of this world), packed with suspense, and never stops feeding you clues and hints to the bigger picture. And that's even without touching on the characters that Jesse meets throughout her gauntlet, those who have managed to survive the events occurring in The Oldest House, From the insanely hyper-intelligent Emily Pope of the research department, or the 'janitor' who clearly knows more than he's letting on, the heights of the production value will have you inspecting every line on Jesse's face as she talks, and marvelling at Pope's seriously long eyelashes. Control’s narratives, and its characters, are complex, morally ambiguous, and sometimes downright odd, and I'm on board with every one of them. The only criticism I have is that Control feels unfinished, like a sentence left dangling with a missing clause. There are some questions I still have after finishing that I love are left unanswered, but the ending came more quickly and abruptly than I would have liked. Remedy has always struggled to finish its stories, and Control is yet another victim in this regard. But, make up your own mind, because no matter what you think of the ending, a game like this is a glorious rarity. Don't do yourself a disservice by reading any more into Control. Go in unaware, revel in its madness, and never take a corridor at face value. That's the best way to serve up - and regaining - Control.Reviewed on PC, using an RTX 2070 Super provided by Nvidia.Sam Loveridge is the Global Editor-in-Chief of GamesRadar, and joined the team in August 2017.

Game Informer,"When Jesse Faden walks into the Federal Bureau of Control and picks up the director’s handgun, she inadvertently assumes authority over the enigmatic government organization. The director’s gun is a powerful and versatile tool, but it’s also a deception; Jesse’s greatest weapon isn’t the one in her hand, it’s the one in her head. Control gives players access to a host of powerful psychic abilities that are as satisfying to use as they are to watch. So Jesse has the gun, but she doesn’t need the gun. Jesse is the gun.With games like Max Payne and Alan Wake, Remedy has always put care into telling stories through kinetic action. Control perfectly fits that mold, and it especially excels in its atmosphere. Remedy delivers an eerie, dreamlike experience that is hard to shake off even after you stop playing, and I loved being transported to this bizarrely fascinating world. As you explore the shifting, brutalist architecture inside the Federal Bureau of Control, you encounter an odd cast of amusing characters and interact with several seemingly ordinary objects that hold immense power, such as a mirror that sucks you into an inverted universe or a refrigerator that hurts people when no one is looking at it.But powerful things are also very dangerous. An aggressive, multidimensional species known as the Hiss are trying to invade our world, and like a champagne cork, the Federal Bureau of Control is the only thing preventing these creatures from spewing into our reality. As you work against the Hiss, you learn more about Jesse’s place in this world, and I enjoyed the slow reveal of her backstory. Unfortunately, the motives of the rest of the cast remain incredibly vague, which leads to a few awkward and confusing plot points. Some of these moments are papered over by the overall strangeness of the Federal Bureau of Control, but they did ultimately pull me out of an otherwise expertly crafted world.As mentioned previously, the director’s handgun is an incredibly powerful tool in your battle against the Hiss. This weapon can shift forms, becoming everything from a long-range sniping tool to a crowd-control shotgun. Remedy’s gunplay remains as tight and precise as ever, but the director’s handgun does have one idiosyncrasy: It can’t be manually reloaded. It taps into an unlimited well of ammunition, but every time a magazine runs dry (or if you stop firing for a bit) it takes a few seconds to reload itself. It took me a while to get used to this rhythm in combat, but as Jesse acquires new abilities, managing ammo became less of an issue.In the end, Jesse’s weapon feels like a secondary tool in combat. Her greatest means of offense is her suite of psychic powers – especially her ability to toss objects around the room. Remedy nailed the feel of telekinesis; picking up objects with Jesse’s mind and launching them at foes packs a satisfying punch. I never grew tired of pulling chunks of cement out of the ground or snatching missiles from the air and sending them back at a group of foes. Almost every object in the environment can become a bullet, and even in the heat of battle, finding something to launch is easy. In fact, you don’t even have to target objects to pick them up. If you hold down the telekinesis button, Jesse grabs the nearest object automatically, which makes using the power effortless and intuitive.Jesse has a few other useful abilities in her psychic toolbelt, such as grabbing nearby junk to shield herself from frontal attacks. This shield can even be upgraded to propel debris at enemies. Another neat power lets Jesse mind-control enemies, converting hurt foes into allies. These additional powers are fun to play with, but they pale in comparison to the telekinetic launch, and I had few reasons to return to them over and over again. Additionally, upgrading these abilities is rarely satisfying. While each new power provides a wider toolset in combat, most of the upgrades simply increase your damage output, meaning there were no new combat strategies for me to explore in the late game.Despite a few drawn-out battles near the end, Control is a complete rush. With the power at Jesse’s fingertips, I walked into every room ready for an amazing fight. When I walked out, it often looked like a tornado had torn through the building. The Federal Bureau of Control is a fascinating place to explore, and I loved every bizarre encounter inside its creaking hallways.

Polygon,"Filed under:Behold, one of 2019’s best and weirdest gamesIf you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.Control’s story and characters challenge, confuse, and intrigue me from its literal first minute. The game’s uncanny manipulation of light, shadows, and reflections astounds me. Its dialogue sometimes feels odd and stilted — particularly at the beginning — but I understand the utility of that approach the more I play. Everything in Control is deliberate, but it takes a long time for it to explain itself and its reasoning. Being lost is a feature, not a bug. But I’m in good hands. Developer Remedy Entertainment is fully committed to its pulpy, surreal premise, and Control is as much a technical marvel as an artistic achievement. Control begins as its heroine, Jesse Faden, walks into a functionally invisible skyscraper in New York City. Things go pear-shaped as soon as she crosses its threshold, and she’s just as puzzled as I am. I know that because she’s already narrating her actions as part of a mental conversation she’s having with … someone. Or something. Or possibly me?Polygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences.

If you want curated lists of our favorite media, check out What to Play and What to Watch.Weirdness runs like rebar throughout the building, which is really a world-within-a-world called the Oldest House. It is also the headquarters of the Federal Bureau of Control, a U.S. agency focused on researching and understanding the “paranatural.” This is a universe in which alternate realities bleed past their margins, the astral plane is a real (and very pretty) place you can visit, and everyday objects like floppy disks carry psychic weight to siphon for power. The Oldest House is like a conduit for the supernatural, and Jesse and I — that’s how I think of us, as a team — are compelled to demystify its inner workings. It’s a large job in an impossibly large building. As we travel further, the mystery deepens and everything becomes more bizarre before even hinting at becoming understandable.The Oldest House is a character without a speaking role but with plenty of agency. It’s designed in the imposing exposed concrete of Brutalist architecture. That concrete, with so many 90-degree angles, should be boring, but the Finnish developers at Remedy make it fascinating. Somewhere in the stew of fluorescent lighting and soul-deadening desks, filing cabinets, and office supplies, beauty sprouts. This is what it would look and feel like if the Ghostbusters were a bureaucracy that planted a cubicle farm in the most haunted house it could find.Nothing about the environment should be attractive, and certainly not beautiful, but even the smallest details seem to hum with secret purpose and life. Exploration of the seemingly mundane offices pays off, because there are items to find everywhere. At first, I’m intrigued. The often heavily redacted documents I discover and read add to the mystery instead of explaining it — my sidearm used to be what?! — but sometimes all of the reading feels too much like homework. Or maybe that was its own head fake. Doing my homework pays off when objects and people I’ve read about for days or known about for years reappear dozens of hours later. They’re more than busywork. They’re Control’s narrative support beams. Remedy knows how to create an elaborate, internally consistent world perhaps better than any other developer, and its ability to do so with a light dusting of sparse details mixed with the courage to withhold answers for an uncomfortably long time is one of its best tricks. There is a reward for that risk, delightful surprises for making sure that the studio is showing and telling.Control is more than an imposing office building simulator filled with fluttering paperwork. Very early on, Jesse and I pick up our Service Weapon, which is a powerful tool that only the Bureau’s director can use. I know this because Jesse knows this, and Jesse knows this because the last director pretty clearly used the weapon to kill himself, and he seems to be speaking to us through the bullet lodged in his brain. The weapon is effectively a pistol at first, but we learn how to transform it into arcane versions of standard video game firearms like a shotgun, grenade launcher, and more. The “gun” doesn’t have bullets, and we never have to reload. As long as we can avoid pulling the trigger for a few seconds, it will always refill (reform? rebuild?) itself with ammo.Those pauses between clips are an effective incentive to use the other half of Jesse’s offensive capabilities, which are just as trippy as her Service Weapon. The first, a Force-like power called Launch, allows us to telekinetically hurl objects at enemies. It’s easy to use and easy to forget, so I only remember to use it when I can’t shoot. At first.  But Launch — which smartly ditches the precision of aiming a gun and instead locks onto enemy targets — quickly becomes my primary method of attack and the focus of my skill upgrades. The ability also plugs us into our environment. Everything we pull toward our raised right hand is an interactive part of the world, whether we’re picking up items like filing cabinets or, when those aren’t available, literally yanking chunks of cement out of the walls and floors. And those objects are as deadly as bullets. There is no greater satisfaction in Control’s combat than putting a bad guy between the objects that we’re manipulating with our minds and another enemy, braining him from behind, and then launching the still-flying makeshift projectile at his buddy’s face.The number of physical objects that fly through the air during these battles and the way in which they interact with each other is one of Control’s most impressive technical achievements. But again, it’s not just a pretty effect. Watching a fire extinguisher rip through an enemy and collide with a desk whose papers explode, scatter, and flutter down to the ground around us as we continue to fight has a secondary purpose: It makes the absurdity of Control believable. I upgrade abilities just like I upgrade our gun, and our new powers become indispensable. It’s unfailingly fun to fire my gun to empty, toss fax machines at shields, and tear out some nearby concrete for a killing blow. The world is mine to manipulate and disassemble, and I always do.The word “power” is a leitmotif in Control, and rooms often look like what you’d expect from the aftermath of using that incredible amount of power to batter your enemies. Everything is either smashed or still in the process of floating back down to the ground. The combat is bombastic and satisfying, and I am capable of creating beautiful mayhem from the first hours of the game. And I only gain access to more power from there.Control’s most glaring flaw — the one that caused me to get frustrated and spook the dog a few times — is its inconsistent health bar. We can crouch behind cover, but it’s nowhere near as safe as a bona fide cover system. Control attempts to mitigate that with a skill, but too often the moment between having a large amount of health and being wiped out feels impossibly quick. We often died from an attack that felt like it came from nowhere. Being cautious almost always pays off, but Control’s movement options, offensive capabilities, and environments don’t always support that strategy as well as I would like.Remedy has always been an atmospheric and visual powerhouse, but Control on Windows PC is packed with a surprising amount of technology — as long as you’re playing on a GeForce RTX graphics card. Control isn’t the first game to use ray tracing, the budding technology that promises to bring ever more realistic lighting to video games, but it’s the first game I’ve seen to demonstrate its artistic potential.

  While great graphics can’t make a bad game good, they can make a game better at the margins. I played Control on a Polygon-provided gaming PC with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080, and the lighting effects helped turn surreality into reality. Walking past panes of transparent glass only to see perfectly rendered reflections of the environment behind me was stunning, and I kept finding new areas and new uses of the technology that made me stop and gawk at the visuals. Control remains an impressive game on consoles and modest PC hardware, but it’s also one of the best showpieces for ray tracing that Nvidia could have hoped for. I have no doubt it will sell video cards.Control’s dizzying, hallucinatory visuals exist in service of an experience that remains exciting from its opening hours until the credits roll and, without spoiling anything, that ending goes to amazing — and confusing! — places. So many games, movies, and TV shows that are this obviously inspired by David Lynch or Stephen King fall into the trap of providing too much atmosphere while failing to deliver the story or payoff necessary to make it all feel like it was worth it. Control does not suffer from that problem, and I can’t wait until more of you are able to play it so we can discuss the answers that it gives and the questions that it poses at the end. I can’t separate Control’s deliberate oddities from its beauty or from its characters, and that’s what makes it so easy to recommend. This is one of the best games of the year. Control will be released Aug. 27 on PlayStation 4, Windows PC, and Xbox One. The game was reviewed using final “retail” Windows PC download codes provided by 505 Games.

   on February 2, 2021 at 12:03AM PSTEditor's note: Following the launch of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, developer Remedy Entertainment has released Control: Ultimate Edition. This new version of Control includes all of its previously released DLC, including its story expansions The Foundation and AWE, and comes with new improvements over the last-gen version. Below are our impressions of how Control: Ultimate Edition runs on PS5, written by Phil Hornshaw. You can also read our full PlayStation 5 review for an in-depth breakdown of the console. Continue after the break for the original Control review.Control is gorgeous and intense on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, but the Ultimate Edition on the current generation of consoles is Remedy Entertainment's excellent 2019 game at its best. Control Ultimate Edition is a prettier, more stable way to enjoy Remedy's strange paranormal world, and on PlayStation 5, it works in the great features of the DualSense to elevate the experience even more.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Control Video ReviewThe primary difference between the original edition of Control and the Ultimate Edition is the latter's enhanced graphics. The Ultimate Edition offers two different modes: Performance, which prioritizes frame rate, and Graphics, which leverages the hardware for better textures, lighting, and ray tracing. In both modes, though, the difference between the Ultimate Edition and the standard version of Control is stark. These are drastic improvements over Control on the PS4 and make an already beautiful game look and play even better.The graphics-heavy mode is something to behold. Control is full of reflective surfaces, whether they're glass office walls or puddles of water or blood in its dark, brutalist halls. With ray tracing enabled, the game becomes full of gorgeous, real-world reflections, with protagonist Jesse's face appearing on the screens of TVs as she watches films created by Dr. Casper Darling, and Control's stark lighting and cinematography finding mirrors in wet concrete floors. Control's art direction was already impressive, but it achieves even more on the newer hardware to create endless beautiful frames. Graphics mode sacrifices frame rate for those pretty images, but it never chugs or runs poorly (unlike the base game on PS4 Pro)--its frame rate looks to be on par with the last generation of hardware, but with more stability. Flipping to the performance mode sacrifices those beautiful reflections in favor of a silky 60fps, but Control looks great in both modes. The smoothness afforded by the higher frame rate definitely works to make combat feel a little more intense and responsive, but both modes work extremely well, so choosing one comes down to personal preference.On PS5, Control Ultimate Edition benefits from the DualSense controller's haptic feedback. The intensity of Jesse's footsteps when she's running or walking are translated to the controller, as are the different firing modes of the Service Weapon as you let loose with the automatic Spin or charge up a big blast with Pierce. Best, though, are Jesse's powers, with the controller adding oomph to the massive blast of a melee attack and capturing the whistling catch as you use telekinesis to grab hold of a piece of concrete. The haptics add just a little something extra to Control, helping to make Jesse's powers and weapons feel distinct and impactful.With its graphical add-ons, the stability and performance enhancements, and the inclusion of all of Control's DLC, the Ultimate Edition really is the best way to experience Control--and the PS5's haptics really add an extra layer of intensity to a game that already feels great to play. If you haven't experienced Control yet, this is the best way to do so. If you have, this is a good excuse to jump back into its beautiful, strange, inventive world once again. -- Phil Hornshaw, 2 February 2021. Our original Control review by Peter Brown, first published in August 2019, continues below. When you're so used to games that ease you in, the confronting nature of Control is immediately compelling. There's plenty of time to get to know characters, study the environment, and gradually pick up new mechanics and skills, but Control's sinister atmosphere is impactful, sending a rush of questions through your head from the moment you press start.Who is Jesse Faden? Why does she seem both lost and found on her first day as director at the Federal Bureau of Control? How can she possibly maintain her composure in the face of the haunting ethereal and material distortions that have overtaken the bureau? You may only have some answers to these questions by the time the credits roll. While being vague or opaque could be viewed as a flaw in other games, obfuscation is part of what makes Control so spellbinding. Impressively, the mysteries grip ever tighter as you navigate the bureau's headquarters in search of answers. Knowledge is power, but it frequently opens doors to possibilities you never knew existed--doors that are better left shut, so far as Jesse and surviving FBC members are concerned.If you've played past works from Remedy Games, you will instantly recognize the studio's footprint. Control's story plays with grim truths and strange themes. Everything is a serious matter, except when it isn't and a dark sense of humor creeps in to offer a momentary respite--which, yes, includes plenty of FMV shorts. The combat system is designed for you to be equal parts agile and destructive, bearing a notable resemblance to the studio's Microsoft-exclusive, Quantum Break. Combat aside, that game felt like a step removed from what Remedy does best. Control feels like Remedy has found its footing again.There is one major aspect that is decidedly new for Remedy: Control is non-linear, built in the vein of a metroidvania and filled with reasons to retrace your steps over time. This approach is largely handled well, though if there's any aspect of Control that feels lacking it's the handling of the map. It's an unreliable tool presented in a top-down fashion that often feels like more trouble than it's worth. Multi-level areas overlap with one another (you can't isolate them, or zoom in for a closer look) and it's practically impossible to track specific locations you have or have not visited. Broad areas can be tracked, sure, but not, say, a single meeting room in the executive branch.This would be a major issue if not for two things: The signage in the world is surprisingly helpful, and ultimately, Control makes wandering the halls of ""The Oldest House"" a consistent pleasure. If you aren't in awe of the architecture, you're probably getting your kicks from a battle that pops up when you least expected it. Referring to the FBC headquarters as a house is a bit misleading, though you'll grow to understand how in time. In practical terms, it is a massive multi-story facility that screams government, with angular interiors formed in stone and metal, with minimal flourish. It has the outward appearance of an orderly place of process, which, while true, undersells the reality therein, or the lack thereof.The dance between fact and fiction is at the heart of Control's setting and a fascinating narrative that unravels in Jesse's mind through a series of inner monologues and psychic projections. There are exchanges between characters that move certain elements forward, but so much of Control hinges on Jesse's discoveries and her interpretations of their meaning. Even though you're clued into her thoughts, there's an underlying element that Jesse fails to explain because, to her, it's matter-of-fact. Whatever it is has always been a part of her, creating a gap of understanding that you, for the most part, can only hope to fill in with your own inferences. There's a constant desire to know more, yet to also maintain distance from the truth in order to preserve the mystery. It's to Control's credit that it effortlessly facilitates this exchange.If it's otherworldly, if it seems to defy explanation, odds are the FBC is running tests to discover the underlying cause and contain the consequences from the outside world. Deep within the guts of the house lie experiments and studies that dig into paranormal disturbances, the collective subconscious, and alternate dimensions. The FBC posits that entities from beyond our realm have used objects of power--archetypical things that we know and take for granted--as gateways into our world. After years of the FBC gathering these strange objects for study, the house has become an amplified conduit for a force known as The Hiss, which can reshape and move matter. The source of this power, a dimension known as the Astral Plane, has crept into the bureau, and some far-off corridors bear its telltale monochromatic, geometric motif. Occasionally, you will get pulled into this strange world to undergo skill trials, but your visits are always short, which helps preserve the mystique in the long run. Back in the ""real"" world, lowly agents and high-ranking FBC enforcers have been corrupted en masse. Many float harmlessly in mid-air, chanting strange mantras in boardrooms, hallways, and research facilities. Generally, if there's headroom, there are floaters. The more aggressive of the bunch pop into existence before your eyes as you explore the bureau. They, like Jesse, fight with a mix of guns and telekinetic powers. They are generally fun adversaries, and battles are punctuated by some incredible special effects. Furniture and small props are whipped into a frenzy when you hurl a desk from a cubicle and into a group of enemies. Sparks and colorful plumes of energy fill the air when a nearby explosion cuts through the incandescent trails left behind by the hiss.There are only a few unique enemies or bosses to speak of, but by and large the AI, in conjunction with a great variety of architectural layouts, makes every fight feel engaging. Whether a simple encounter or a complex assault, you have to approach combat with a juggling act in mind, shifting between expending ammunition and psychic energy when one or the other is depleted. You also have to learn how to defend against and recover from harm. The only way to heal in combat is to pick up essence dropped by fallen enemies, which often requires you to throw yourself into the fray while also protecting yourself from further damage.New powers come with story milestones, but weapon forms are crafted from collectible materials. Their stats, and Jesse's, increase with the application of randomized ranked mods dropped by enemies and found in hidden containment chests. You will likely come across hundreds of mods, but because you can only hold and use a limited amount, you will end up dismantling most of them to make space in your inventory. Mods can make a tangible difference, especially once you start to find high-ranking ones, but they can't make up for a lack of skill or understanding of Jesse's tools during the game's greatest tests. Control is a great-looking game in general, from the overall art design to the technical execution, but combat is a notable standout in that regard. While the experience on PC can be tuned to run at a consistently smooth frame rate, the PS4 version (playing on a PS4 Pro with supersampling enabled) can exhibit stuttering when fights are at their most chaotic--no issues were spotted with the Xbox One version. This, thankfully, is an uncommon occurrence, but it definitely clues you in to how taxing the special effects and real-time physics are.With a fair amount of extracurricular exploration, it took me about 15 hours to get to the end of Control's campaign. Though I watched the credits roll, there are still plenty of side quests for me to tackle. Jesse isn't the only sane person in the bureau after all, and the handful of key NPCs that populate each sector have co-workers gone missing or projects left abandoned that might put the bureau at future risk. They not only give you more reason to spend time in Jesse's shoes, but the supporting cast is great across the board, brought to life with excellent voice acting and top-notch character design. They aren't deep characters and your conversations never go very far, but I'm more than willing to help them in their time of need, if only to see what quirky or oddball thing they say when I return.One of my favorite aspects of Control, now that I've got room to breathe, is spending quality time with its collectible texts and videos. I've managed to read most of the in-game materials while pushing through main missions and tackling optional pursuits, but there are so many fascinating threads to pull on that it's easy to imagine new possibilities lying in wait; if only I studied the evidence a little closer, or considered a new angle, maybe the missing pieces of Jesse's story would come into view. These tidbits can be educational, disturbing, and at times wildly entertaining, and they have inspired me to look deeper into topics like Jungian psychology.It's not often that a game invades my thoughts the way Control has. I'm at the point where I want to consume every last thing it has to offer. And if I'm honest, it also makes me want to go back and replay Remedy's past games, too. Sure, it's a faulty metroidvania in some respects, but there are so many exceptional qualities afoot that Control handily deflects any momentary ire. I can't wait to take part in discussions about the game, to see what others have figured out, and to better understand where it all fits into Jesse's story.Control is featured as one of our favorite PS5 games.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"

It tells an exciting and interesting story in an extremely fascinating setting. It weaves in the episodic framework of a television show without requiring you to put down the controller for long periods of time. The action weaves together traditional shooting and supernatural abilities in a way that feels very natural, letting you flow from one move to the next in a way that feels pretty cool. Control also trusts its players by creating a large, shifting space to explore without feeling the need to paint a ton of UI over the action in an effort to keep you on track. The signs on the walls work in Control, helping to ground it and make the Oldest House feel like a real space. Well... right up until all the astral projection starts happening, anyway.The story, setting, and world of Control was easily my favorite part of the game. From the opening moments, when Jesse Faden finds her way to the front door of the Federal Bureau of Control's headquarters only to find the front desk completely unmanned, inspiring her to step in and dig deeper, I was hooked. There's something about the game's mix of Twin Peaks, X-Files, and SCP Foundation that just spoke to me from the get-go. From there, you begin exploring the Oldest House on a search for your brother, who's been missing since the men in black showed up and took him when you were kids. The hows and whys of all that are fascinating, and I think the game's main plot is really solid, even if the ending wasn't quite as explicitly revelatory as some might want. But it's all the parts around the edges that do the heavy lifting in Control. Finding a ""weird"" artifact down a side path or reading some of the game's well-written collectibles ends up feeling rewarding on its own, and chasing down some of those side missions ended up being my favorite stuff in the game. It has a few memorable characters that you'll meet along the way, but for the most part it's Jesse, alone, exploring an amazing space full of intensely weird supernatural objects and blasting possessed humans with a cool-looking gun that morphs into different styles of weapon.The combat feels fine in Control, and it fleshes out more and more as you progress and unlock new powers. You'll eventually be able to levitate, for example, and this opens up some interesting new concepts for combat. Control isn't necessarily a cover-shooter, though putting some geometry between you and the incoming attacks certainly helps. The action flows pretty well, letting you slide from one move to the next, over to the gun for a bit, and back without feeling like you're plodding or planting your feet after every move, which was something that pushed me away from Quantum Break. There were a couple of tough, if not mildly frustrating boss fights to be found here, but nothing that felt wildly unfair or broken.Control also nods towards Remedy's long-running interest in tying its games to episodic television or radio. After finishing a main mission, you'll hear about your next task, and then get a quick montage of future events. It isn't explicit, but it sets up a real ""next time on Control"" vibe that kept me pushing forward to learn all the context behind the moments in the clips. I was rarely disappointed by what I found.This is an open-world adventure game of sorts, one you could sort of compare to a Metroid-style game. You'll gain traversal moves here and there that open up access to new parts of the facility. But that isn't necessarily a huge part of the game. I found it really interesting that Control trusts players to navigate the facility without the benefit of an on-screen minimap. You can pull up a map of the facility at any time and get a sense of where you're at, but most of your reconnoitering comes from actually looking at your surroundings and reading signs. Like a real person might actually do. This probably isn't the first time a game has done this, and some people will probably come away from Control wishing that the map was more functional and modern, but this is the first time I can say this felt like a benefit to the game instead of just a game with bad mapping options. This helps the Oldest House feel ""real,"" even when its warping, twisting walls reconfigure on the fly, leaving you wondering what just happened and where you might be now.This is probably a good a time as any to say that this review applies to the PC version of the game. I found Control to run quite well there on a few different configurations, and this was also the first game I've seen that made all the fancy and extremely expensive ray-tracing stuff that Nvidia has been banking on lately feel like a cool, useful feature. The reflections and lighting with all those bells and whistles turned on just look fantastic. But the game still looks solid without the (extremely) expensive graphics card. Much has been said about the graphical fidelity and frame rate issues found in the console versions of the games, especially when running on the old base model boxes. That stuff sounds like a real shame and like a significant knock against Control if you own the original PS4 or Xbox One, but that's beyond the scope of this review.Great performances, strong action, and a solid sense of design all come together to make Control one of my favorite games so far in 2019. Control feels like Remedy finally making all of its different interests play well together, better than they've ever done it before.© 2023 FANDOM, INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

USgamer,"I want to tell you about a recurring dream I have. In this dream, I become aware that I am dreaming. I still see myself from the vantage point of some faraway observer, yet my body relinquishes control to me. But something is off - my limbs feel distant and remote, like puppeteering a drunk mannequin. My legs are lead weights. The people in the dream wonder what is wrong. Is that a presence I can feel, standing over me?Remedy’s latest game, Control, is like a dream, too. Its story is underpinned by that same sleeptime logic, asking you to traverse mirrors, float through impossible geometry, or pull on a light cord three times to be transferred to somewhere else. It is about poking through the membrane of the world to slosh around in the primordial goo beneath. It’s about will and the exertion of will over others. It’s about authority. It’s about a woman called Jesse Faden searching for her lost brother, 17 years after the fact, exploring a government facility where the rules of our world no longer apply. That name, Control, has layers. Within minutes of arriving at The Federal Bureau of Control, Jesse finds its director dead on the floor. She picks up the gun from near his corpse, the Service Weapon, and finds that this transfers his status to her. Jesse becomes the new Director. She’s suddenly in control.It’s also about Remedy taking back control for itself, now it’s no longer an Xbox exclusive studio, kicking off the lead weights from its legs. The result of this new freedom is something bizarre - a story in the new-weird genre, taking influence from novels such as House of Leaves and the Southern Reach Trilogy. In fact, the second book in the Southern Reach Trilogy features a protagonist who calls himself Control. He’s the acting director of a shadowy agency that’s investigating some paranormal event, some oddity that gets inside peoples’ heads and changes them.In Control that oddity has a name: the Hiss. This aggressive force has spread throughout the facility - also known as The Oldest House - taking over the minds of almost everyone inside. Most of these puppets attack on sight, while many hang in the air as if suspended in water, whispering some corrupt sermon. For an action game, it is hair-raisingly creepy at times. “This is going to be weirder than usual” - that’s the first piece of dialogue in Control, both a scene setter and a mission statement. The Oldest House is a leviathan - a huge, brutalist skyscraper that shifts like it’s a living organism. Its interior dimensions do not match the exterior; one area within takes you across an impossible chasm in a cable car, dropping you off in an endless hall filled with black obelisks. This strange building is a vault where the government has been hoarding objects of power - everyday items that have been touched by the world (or worlds) that overlap our own. From teleporting rubber ducks to telekinetik floppy disks and hungry fridges, it is a paranatural museum of peculiarities. The flea can’t see the dog, just as we can’t comprehend the scale of an ever-expanding universe swallowing us whole. Without special equipment, humans can’t see the microorganisms that cover our surroundings like a living carpet, either. Our eyes are unreliable mirrors. The Bureau is all about uncovering the horrifying truths that should be reflected back. From the strange surprises that fill the office halls to the quarry where the Bureau processes black rock beneath the majesty of the Milky Way - all still contained within the walls of this ‘house’ - this isn’t your standard video game space. You’re always wanting to push forward, to see what’s waiting for you on the next floor, behind the next security door, or over that previously impassable chasm you can suddenly float across with a new power. One of the reasons Remedy decided on brutalist architecture for The Oldest House was because it’s economical to create these stark, clean environment assets. The end result of this design decision is one of the most stylish, aesthetically pleasing video game locations in years. Everything stands out against the ivory balconies and monolithic blocks of concrete. Enemies appear in a flash of red - the kind of red you usually only see in emergency situations; a dangerous glow. When a Hiss-controlled human dies, they expire in a colourful mist, like the shadow of a rainbow caught by a swift breeze. You deliver this kaleidoscope death with your Service Weapon, an interdimensional gun that can transform between four different forms. Whether it’s the satisfying pop, pop of the pistol, the neutron star charge of the sniper mode, the fanning spray of the shotgun, or the bucking spittle of the submachine gun, it’s always satisfying. Part of this is down to the incredible sound design, some of it is the flashy visual effects, but the biggest impact comes from Control’s rip-roaring physics and destructibility. Every single fight is like that corridor shootout from The Matrix - the crumbling plaster, explosions, and careening corpses. Dust motes and papers float to the ground in the aftermath. As you press on through the story, you bind objects of power to Jesse. These allow you to dash through the air, float, pull up a debris shield, and manipulate your environment via telekinesis. The latter lets you pluck incoming rockets from the air and launch them back at your assailants. Towards the end of the game, you’ll be combining these powers together to float above the battlefield, raining down death and timing your shield to negate incoming damage. While dream logic might be one of the key themes of the story, you won’t be tripping up a kerb with lead legs here. You feel like a god. It’s Remedy’s best combat system to date and it handles, yes, like a dream. The only downside to all these moving parts is performance. Control’s frame rate on PS4 Pro isn’t always smooth, and the game seems to have a bit of trouble every time you unpause it. Occasionally, the map - which you 100% need to navigate this metroidvania space - doesn’t load in when you pull it up. Hopefully these issues get ironed out because - other than a couple of frustrating deaths coupled with a maddening checkpointing system - I struggle to fault Control. It’s the most interesting, exciting, and stylish new franchise we’ve had in years. There’s a set-piece late on that evokes the best moments from Japanese character action games, and I think that’s where the game fully cemented itself as a Game of the Year contender. I’ve only touched on the themes of the story in vague terms as not to spoil it for you, but it all comes to a satisfying conclusion, leaving just enough threads loose for you to mull over as you sweep The Oldest House for more videos and documents to piece the mystery together for yourself. The writing, direction, and performances are consistently brilliant. This is Remedy at the peak of its game. Control feels like a company rediscovering itself, waking from a long slumber. Remedy’s legs work as intended once more, the vestiges of sleep paralysis a distant memory.

Remedy has not been shy about its affection for twisted filmmaker David Lynch. And if Alan Wake was a nod to Twin Peaks, then CONTROL is a violently unsubtle nod to Lynch’s entire filmography that’s been dipped in the new weird genre and jettisoned into the astral plane. Although Control is not just a collage of homages as Remedy has used those influences as an outline to house its a wholly unique world filled with bizarre, unexplainable oddities and madness. But there’s a method to this madness and what an incredible method it is.Most of Control’s madness stems from its universe. It takes place entirely within a structure called the Oldest House, a building that is bigger on the inside than what its physical outer boundaries could realistically allow. In these deceptive walls lies the Federal Bureau of Control, a secret, semi-shady organization meant to explain, study, and hide the paranormal activities in the world that defy logic and reason. It’s a regular-looking Manhattan building on the outside and a vast, paranormal investigation firm on the inside.But Remedy did not just settle for a mere X-Files-esque set dressing for the game with a handful of cheap audio logs and heavy-handed, blood-on-the-wall-graffiti environmental storytelling. Instead, the talented team has meticulously created a multifaceted approach to worldbuilding that comes through in every aspect of the game. The astounding number of audio messages, documents, and in-world videos that are scattered around give an overwhelming amount of detail about the FBC and its many aspects that truly paint how vast and deep this organization goes.ALSO: How Control learned from Dark Souls to trust its playersSince the Oldest House is so enormous, it has a variety of different departments with different specializations. And almost every document pertains to where it is found and explains what you’re seeing or what is happening in that specific area. Instead of other games that haphazardly throw lore-building collectibles in random locations, Control’s are deliberately placed and better contextualize what you’re immediately witnessing or what you’re eventually find. Either way, by creating a world with explainer collectibles in mind (or vice versa), Remedy has built a complex universe that is more real and gives players the means to try to understand it.The Oldest House also stands on its own, aside from the directly supernatural aspects too. Its quarters are filled with functional areas like bathrooms, offices, cafeterias, and relatively empty rooms that make it feel like an actual, lived-in place. Some of the notes even detail office drama and book clubs, humanizing the employees that work there and show that, despite their otherworldly profession, they are just people. All of these aspects coalesce and form one of the most thorough video game universes in the medium.Reading and exploring play a big role in how players will partake in its lore and Remedy encourages this by hooking players through their desire to learn. Control’s world is naturally unnatural and these surreal, unexplained phenomena beg to be dissected. The aforementioned collectibles offer just enough explanation while also redacting a decent portion of lines to hold onto some sense of secrecy. This cycle of witnessing something odd and learning more about it from a file or cutscene is masterfully doled out as it constantly keeps you on the hook, ready to unearth more unusual information after every digested chunk of information. Not everything has — or needs — an explanation and only some of it is directly told to you, but it still leverages the player’s curiosity and rewards it like few other video games.The Oldest House is symbolic of this ideal. The 1950s-era sleek Brutalist design is simple yet foreboding, elegantly communicating that this is a pragmatic organization only concerned with studying and hiding secrets and not setting up stylish furniture that matches the drapes. The in-world signs are also pragmatic, as they are diegetic ways to point players to where they’ll need to go. Signposting like this is more immersive and goes with the game’s intention of getting the player to actually think over mindlessly following a waypoint. Puzzles are also similarly set up, as the game lets you figure out what to and bask in the satisfaction of figuring it out yourself.But being an abnormal building, the Oldest House is at its best when it is twisting and bending in unfathomable ways. While there are some impressive, trippy transformation scenes reminiscent of The Matrix or Doctor Strange, the lighting is the best part as it paints entire rooms in blinding light that conveys that this place is not of this world. Given how impressive some of the architecture is, it’s a shame the game doesn’t have a Photo Mode to let players better admire its beauty. Seeing how the Oldest House adapts and shifts from the powers that be is a visual spectacle that encourages players to peek around the next corner and inspect every room in order to find out what else this odd building has in store.The narrative also follows the same cues to get players to keep going. Protagonist Jesse Faden ends up trekking to the Oldest House to find her brother who went missing many years ago. She’s hardly able to ring the bell at the front desk before she is crowned Director of the entire place, a coveted position reserved for only one person at a time. Her newfound power not only unlocks untapped abilities along the way, but also enables her to find her brother without running into as much bureaucratic red tape.Control’s core plot utilizes the same mystery and intrigue that make the optional narrative content so enjoyable. But the difference here is that it uses its center stage to let players also enjoy the writing, pacing, and performances in a way those other aspects can’t quite do. Jesse is mostly admirable through her confidence and ability to handle what gets thrown at her while her inner monologues and occasional wit fill her out as a more complete person. Secondary characters are likable too, benefiting from the well-written script and natural acting; two qualities that are hard to pair with a script full of made-up jargon.Most of the base plot isn’t as twisty as the lore surrounding it as might imply yet said twisty lore makes up for it. Learning about the world and all of its terms while also keeping up with narrative swerves might be a little hard to follow, after all. Even though you’ll catch enough of it to be entertained, it’s already admittedly hard to follow some parts since it dives pretty deeply into The Weird™. Few will probably completely absorb the story the first run through, but Control is a game that’s meant to played multiple times as you grasp more parts in each run like a Stanley Kubrick or Quentin Tarantino film.And while Alan Wake and Quantum Break also had similarly brain-bending stories, they weren’t quite as enjoyable to actually play. Quantum Break’s encounters were slowly paced and far too easy and Alan Wake was a functional, yet incredibly basic third-person shooter. Control cranks up the tempo and encourages players move forward and constantly think on their feet. Like 2016’s Doom, health pours out of slain enemies and constantly killing is the only way to stave off death. Jesse’s handful of abilities allow you to close the gap and always be on the move, granted you can balance her power meter effectively while also giving her shapeshifting gun enough time to recharge.Managing both bars and utilizing the game’s fluid movement options gives the player the ability to effectively burn through enemies if they can think and react fast enough. Maintaining killstreaks not only keeps you alive, but it’s also a way to make the combat consistently engaging on the moment-to-moment level as chaining everything together is incredibly satisfying. It encourages you to play it as aggressively as you can and gives you the tools and tight controls to do so. And even though the upgrade trees are a bit basic and the weapon only allows for two forms at a time, gunplay is frenetic and a solid match to the more cerebral narrative elements as it challenges your mind and reflexes.But it can sometimes be a bit too hectic for its own good as Control runs rather terribly on a base PS4 (and likely the base Xbox One, though we could not test that version), especially during shooting segments. Battles often leave environments looking like a tattered war zone as papers flutter through the air, furniture is thrown askew, and giant cement chunks are tossed about like small pebbles. The effects are undeniably impressive and are reminiscent of an explosive shootout in a John Woo film, yet the base, non-Pro systems simply can’t keep up with such high computational demands. Going through menus can also be a bit sluggish but the frame rate crumbles during most battles and devolves into a slideshow in the busiest segments (except the PC version that we tested on launch day, which ran excellently).Long load times also make the checkpoints even more agonizing, as most of them can set you back quite far. Returning to the action takes a bit too long, especially when there are more obvious checkpoints the game could use to cut down on unnecessary backtracking. They’re never too egregious but retracing your steps slow down the game’s momentum.Boss fights exacerbate the annoying checkpointing because how suddenly they spike the difficulty. Control is a satisfyingly hard game that requires your attention but bosses push the needle too far. Not including the frustrating fatal environmental hazards, each can kill you in only two or so hits, which is quite unforgiving. And since health recovery is reliant on multiple enemies dying, you’ll often have to have nearly perfect runs since there aren’t always adds to farm for health. Sometimes a boss will drop health but it’s few and far between and still secondary to the bigger problem: they do too much damage and dying kills the otherwise strong pacing.The Oldest House’s cement foundation is sturdy enough to withstand these issues as Control is still both Remedy’s biggest and best game. Quantity does not equal quality but upping both at the same time is an elusive task that many developers don’t quite nail. The uncanny story only gets better for those who delve into its extensive pieces of lore. Its combat is inherently energetic and gratifying and more so once you combine different abilities and play it at faster speeds. From its narrative to its world to its puzzles and combat, Control intrigues its players and invites them to think and rewards them handily for doing so; a true remedy for overly linear and coddling game design.GameRevolution reviewed Control on PS4 with a copy provided by the publisher.9Michael Leri is Evolve's senior gaming editor.

Destructoid,"darkSynchronicity is a theme, or at least a phenomenon, that’s used in Control. Through its elaborate and convoluted story, it’s established that spectacular results can be achieved when distant and separate things are attuned to one another. They share a purpose, and that unity is enough to form a meaningful bond.Control‘s design has a shared purpose between its two most important elements. Control is Remedy Entertainment’s magnum opus as it’s the first time the studio has truly found the perfect balance between action and narrative. In Alan Wake, combat was a means of pushing along an exceptional story. In Quantum Break, the two were individually excellent but felt entirely removed from one another. Control is synchronized, though — the narrative is in service of the action, and the action is in service of the narrative. This harmony results in Remedy’s best effort to date.Control (PC, PS4, Xbox One [reviewed])Developer: Remedy EntertainmentPublisher: 505 GamesRelease: August 27, 2019MSRP: $59.99 If a movie franchise hadn’t taken the name, Control might’ve been called Paranormal Activity. There is not a minute of Control that isn’t shrouded in uneasiness. There’s a constant threat of supernatural peculiarity — an atmosphere that’s especially effective against the backdrop of a mundane office building. A pervasive Lynchian mood hangs heavy in the air, like the swell before a massive thunderstorm.It’s Jesse Faden’s first day on the job, a job she never asked for. She shows up at the well-hidden Federal Bureau of Control’s Oldest House looking for her brother. A well-meaning janitor assumes she’s here to apply for the position of custodial assistant. Jesse has her sights set higher.Rather, she ascends straight to the top, immediately appointed as the director of the Bureau. Jesse’s suddenly in charge of dealing with a crisis she didn’t sign up for. The Federal Bureau of Control has been breached by an interdimensional threat called the Hiss. They corrupt anyone and everything they can, most obviously by possessing Bureau employees and turning them into hostile paranatural creatures with supernatural abilities. Their threat runs deep. They even corrupt the Oldest House itself. The building physically transforms and shapeshifts as Jesse scrubs it of the Hiss presence. She’s always cleaning up, ironically lending more credibility to the janitor’s hasty assumption.Jesse’s internal crisis is her true motivation, though. A fractured family and overwhelming feelings of guilt — earmarks of all Remedy games — are the impetus for this story. It’s enough for Jesse to push through rather than instantly resign. She’s a steeled leader, never really showing the vulnerabilities you’d expect from someone thrust into this position.But all of this has been set in motion by the time Jesse first walks through the doors. Control‘s narrative is less about stakes raising and more about unraveling every strand of mystery that stretches across this labyrinthine agency. It deals in epiphany and knowledge, a slow trickle of understanding about how this all came to be. There are crescendos, heart-spiking moments when revelations are grand enough to leave you wide-eyed. Control is surprisingly light on new developments, though. “How?” and “Why?” are more pertinent questions than “What’s next?”The most crucial plot devices drive this third-person shooter in an extraordinary way. The Bureau is home to several Objects of Power, which are ordinary items that have been imbued with incredible energy because society at large thinks about them in a collective way. They’re capable of causing Altered World Events, which are tears in the fabric of perceived reality. It’s the reason the Bureau exists. (Yeah, it’s all very dense. The overarching details and explanations of Control feel nearly impenetrable without just diving in and slowly picking it apart yourself.)As the director, Jesse can bind herself to Objects of Power and acquire whatever traits they possess. For instance, the Service Weapon is a five-function gun that only the director can use. A carousel’s horse gives her the ability to evade in spurts of quick dashes. A home safe allows her to manifest a shield out of nearby debris. There are several more.This is where Control shines the brightest. In the beginning, Control feels like a standard shooter. Before long, Jesse has an arsenal of abilities that are more effective than her gun. Levitate, launch a desk at a cluster of enemies, evade their attacks, and finish them with a few bullets. This is the sort of tango that Control constantly facilitates. It’s always dramatic. The fluidity of the locomotion is a superb catalyst for some truly creative combat. Remedy has crafted a shooter where using a gun usually feels like the lesser option.It takes a while to get used to — all of it. The combat can feel overly methodical until it becomes second nature. The narrative developments plod along until they pay off in a major way. Control rewards patience and persistence and curiosity. There’s never a dull moment, but there are plenty of confusing and uncomfortable moments.Adding to the confusion is the layout of the Oldest House. Remedy’s twisting, tangled design for the setting is a stark departure from the strictly-linear games of its past. Control has a metroidvania-lite bent with side quests that incentivize return trips to previously-visited areas. It’s disorienting at first until navigation becomes (mostly) intuitive. Doors that were once inaccessible eventually open up, revealing shortcuts that make the Oldest House feel more well-designed and cohesive than it did on the first pass. If all else fails, there’s a fast travel system with ample destinations to instantaneously warp to.It’s not perfect, though. Control has its share of sci-fi contrivances that leave you wondering if you missed something, if it’s still to come, or if it needs to just be blindly accepted. That’s bound to happen with a story this outlandish and opaque. Even an end-game conversation takes the easy out with a response akin to “Maybe we’ll never know the answer to that.” It’s not flawless, but it’s certainly satisfying enough.Control is a weird, enigmatic, perplexing masterpiece. It’s also Remedy’s most well-rounded work yet. Like Jesse levitating far off the ground, Control signifies Remedy is capable of ascending to great new heights.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]SuperbA hallmark of excellence. There may be flaws, but they are negligible and won't cause massive damage.

Shacknews,"New to Shacknews? Signup for a Free AccountAlready have an account? Login NowThe paranormal-themed action title from Remedy Entertainment and 505 Games is a heart-pumping head trip with a slew of technical difficulties.At the intersection of fringe science and the immaterial expanse beyond human perception lies the study of the paranormal. It's effectively a study of the unknown, and it's also the primary theme behind Control, a game centered around a clairvoyant protagonist stuck in a complex that doesn't adhere to the laws of any known reality. Paranormal occurrences are a common theme among horror and thriller films, and they happen to form the perfect setting for the new game from Remedy Entertainment, the developers behind Alan Wake and Quantum Break.Control exists in a space somewhere between the thriller and paranormal horror genres. It's an action-based affair steeped in a sort of otherworldly mystery, taking place in a bizarre complex that can rearrange itself and call upon extradimensional forces known collectively as The Hiss. Players assume control of Jesse Faden, who stumbles into the building at the behest of an unknown entity. Jesse follows a path motivated by personal interest, but members of the Federal Bureau of Control, tenants of the possessed FBC complex, immediately accept her as their new boss, despite Jesse feeling like a total stranger. Confused but determined, she must navigate the labyrinthine structure and find the answers she seeks.On the gameplay side, Control is a total genre mash-up. It's overtly a third-person action adventure, but it draws from so many other genres that it's hard to nail down the the game's specific direction. Combat isn't cover-based, though Jesse can and should hide behind cover as needed. Instead, players are meant to go in guns blazing, making use of a reality-bending Service Weapon that can mutate into several different forms, plus a selection of physics-based abilities. Throughout the course of the story, Jesse will eventually gain the power to levitate or dash through the air, among other capabilities, but the basic telekinetic Launch ability sees the most use in battle as well as the game's numerous puzzle-solving areas.Wounding or destroying enemies will drop health as well as collectible items and weapon mods. The environments are fairly vast for a game set more-or-less exclusively indoors, and they sometimes require light platforming to reach hidden or out-of-reach areas. In that regard, Control is almost like a Metroidvania game, in that it wants players to go back to previous areas after earning higher security credentials. New abilities also open new pathways, and to keep things interesting, the forces of The Hiss can and will respawn as Jesse backtracks through the FBC complex. Fortunately, fallen enemies also drop Source, the in-game currency used to build mods and new Service Weapon forms, and other mods and items dropped by enemies scale with Jesse's level.One of the biggest stars in Control is the FBC headquarters itself. Right from the start of the game, the building and environments within give a sense of wonder and danger. In places controlled by The Hiss, walls are able to change their geometry, doors and passageways become obstructed, and ethereal projections of the former FBC director appear as apparitions that guide Jesse but simultaneously put the player ill-at-ease. The source of these events can be traced to various Objects of Power, collected through a litany of past FBC enterprises, which manifest as ordinary objects with the extraordinary ability to distort reality.That's a focus of the game's design: The shifting, ephemeral nature of the building keeps the atmosphere tense, especially as more powerful paranormal entities jump into the fray. To make matters more interesting, Jesse sometimes travels to the Oceanview Hotel, a location seemingly found on another plane of existence, and must often traverse the Astral Plane under the guidance of The Board in order to discover new abilities. All of the locations are tied back to the FBC complex, and though there aren't really any typical open-air environments to be found, the game never really feels like a linear experience.It helps that there are numerous side quests and activities to undertake. Sometimes Jesse will stumble upon a quest in a random location; other times, one of the game's numerous (and remarkably flat-feeling) non-player characters will point her in the direction of tasks that need to be completed. Board Countermeasures can be undertaken by visiting nearby control points, offering items or mods in exchange for combat-focused challenges. There are even Bureau Alerts, which are timed challenges that usually see Jesse clearing out Hiss Nodes or taking down particularly powerful baddies. These fail if the clock runs out or if Jesse dies, but new Bureau Alerts still continue to appear at regular intervals.Control can be really annoying at times. Pop-in and stuttering are noticeable and frequent, and sometimes occur out of the blue. Inventory management with mods becomes a chore as Jesse becomes more powerful, and the returns from scrapping mods pale in comparison to the source gained from regular old combat. Movement can be jittery, sometimes the map just doesn't show up, and even the animations can be wonky: For example, the first time I met Arish, he appeared to be panicking nervously in the middle of the room, floating and moving like he was playing an invisible piano. As soon as I spoke with him, he turned around to the nearby control panel and disappeared from sight, leaving the cutscene to play out between Jesse and a disembodied voice.Strange as it is to admit, I could forgive almost all of those issues if not for problems with navigation. Pulling up the map screen causes immediate slowdown, and a lot of the time, the map image itself does not appear. The FBC building is a labyrinth, and the game pushes players to explore, since new abilities and security credentials will open new paths in previously visited areas. The problem is that getting to those areas is a chore; the map doesn't delineate paths or even floors of the building, forcing players to search the old-fashioned way. I burned almost an hour looking for the Black Rock Quarry only to discover I'd walked past the path I needed to take several times, failing to notice a dimly-lit corridor despite a direct line-of-sight from the nearby control point.With all that said, through all of its numerous issues, Control is a blast. It's a melting pot of some of the best that modern gaming has to offer, with cherry-picked gameplay elements that combine into something that feels immediately familiar, but plays out rather unlike anything else on the market. It's a head trip, asking players to think outside the box before revealing there was no box in the first place. To put it another way, it's a marvel of design marred by its technical ambition.Control is an experience not to be missed. Remedy Entertainment has gone above and beyond to realize the game's paranormal-themed world, and the result is something so entrancing and bizarre that there's really little else to compare it to. It's proof positive that the whole can indeed be greater than the sum of its parts, but in drawing on the best that gaming had to offer, several technical issues managed to sneak in from beyond the void. Whether these glitches or bugs seem silly or nefarious will be up to individual players, but even the biggest bouts of slowdown don't take away from the game's stellar action and environments. It's fast-paced, fun, and pretty damn freaky — all the right elements of a perfect sci-fi thriller.This review is based on a PlayStation 4 download code provided by the publisher. Control released for retail and digital stores on August 27, 2019. The game has been rated M for Mature by the ESRB.Kevin Tucker is a core component of Shacknews' powerful guide development team.

					Kevin Tucker posted a new article, Control review: Hiss Hiss, bang bang 
					Hmm yea, I want to play it at some point, but I'd like to wait for the technical issues to be resolved 				
					Yeah I want to play this on PC, not going to go for the PS4 version as this review mentioned numerous issues and Digital Foundry gave it basically a failing grade on the PS4.  My 980ti in my PC is probably not enough for this beast either.				"
Attack of the Fanboy,"Remedy Games hasn’t made that many games in the past 20+ years the developer has been around, but each time that they do release one it’s been pretty special.  While this is the studio that brought you the original Max Payne games, Alan Wake, Quantum Break, and now Control… each of these games has brought something new to the table.  Whether it was the new gameplay mechanics of bullet-time or Alan Wake’s flashlight, things have always been somewhat interesting when it comes to the gameplay mechanics of Remedy games.  Control is no different, it certainly stands out from other products that Remedy has released over the years, but also feels very familiar to their most recent offerings in Alan Wake and Quantum Break.Remedy has established themselves as the developers that make weird, stylish games.  This has done well with the last two aforementioned series’.  They jumped into the world of FMV in their games, blurring the lines between fantasy and reality.  Control is definitely another one of these.  It’s a weird mess of a story that places you in the shoes of a young woman who finds herself in a place called the Oldest House, which happens to be a hidden building in the middle of New York City where a supernatural threat of the Hiss looms. You become the new Director of a group called the Federal Bureau of Control and can wield a supernatural firearm called the Service Weapon which is your main source of gameplay as it is a third person shooter.  The Hiss are everywhere in the Oldest House and they have the ability to take over and possess the other agents in the building.  The story winds and turns with a little bit more about who you are and why you are there, but it really stays fairly mysterious up until the credits roll.Control is a little bit less linear than other Remedy games.  There’s a massive, multi-level map to explore, with numerous NPC characters to meet, side quests to tackle, blocked passages, and loot to uncover.  There are some aspects of a Metroid-vania style game here, but they are light.  There are Security Doors which require key cards and some areas can’t be accessed without having specific powers, but it never feels not obvious what you need to do.  Most of the stuff that is locked behind abilities really does just add more color to the world.  While the key cards are usually story items that you’ll get in a fairly linear fashion.  The video gamey bits are what keep you pushing forward in Control, but it’s also an incredibly stylish game with a dark weirdness to it.  The imagery, sounds, and general presentation and mysterious story pull you in immediately as we found ourselves really wanting to learn about this world.  Unfortunately, everything does stay pretty vague in Control.  After watching the credits roll, I thought it was definitely worth the time spent, but I did feel a little unfulfilled in so much being left to collectible files that you can read or FMV videos that you can watch along your journey.Control is a third person shooter, but it’s not just a shooter.  There are plenty of abilities to learn as the Director.  Your supernatural abilities allow you to stabilize objects of power which you can then draw abilities from.  You’ll learn things like double jumps, levitation, telekinesis, and others which allow you to fight different types of enemies or reach different areas of the map.  Control is far-less linear than Remedy’s previous games.  There is the main path of the story, which you can really barrel down if you want.  But, there’s also a good bit of side content in this game.  Some of the side content is actually much more interesting than the actual main path and you’ll really miss some cool stuff if you don’t explore this world.  For example, the Hiss are the major threat in the game.  But, there are also others which a scientist is researching in an area called the Pit.  You don’t need to visit the Pit to beat Control, but if you do you’ll get treated to a massive boss fight against a giant mold monster. It’s stuff like this that make Control tough to digest.  Some of this side content is definitely must see, but putting off of the main path does make it unlikely that many will encounter it.  The rewards, whether on the main path or when exploring is points and materials to upgrade your character and weapons.These points will funnel into your different abilities, making the stronger across the course of the game.  As you spend your trait points you will unlock more mod slots for your weapons and personal buffs.  The combat in Control is a mix between third person shooter and an ability focused game.  You’ll definitely be shooting your fair share of enemies, but you can also upgrade your different abilities to use a telekinetic push melee or unlock the ability to pick up and hurl items with your mind.  You can summon items around you as a shield, or levitate over the battlefield while raining down abilities or bullets.  The combat is varied and putting all of the abilities together really make it stand out.  This really doesn’t start clicking until you’re pretty deep into Control though.  The early parts are certainly more bullet-based, while the latter stages are focused on your powerful abilities or juggling back and forth between the two.  As enemies get tougher you’ll manage your ammunition in Service Weapon and your energy to use abilities.  I found myself in familiar patterns again and again.  Since there is no reload and everything runs off of a charge in Control, it always basically felt like I was shooting until I need to recharge the weapon and then using my abilities until the energy ran out.  By the time that energy ran out I was swapping back to the service weapon to repeat the process.  That coupled with dodging and levitating mechanics gave the combat a nice rhythm.  Control on the Xbox One did feel kind of like a PC game that was ported to consoles.  The aiming and targeting felt a bit rigid and not quite as smooth as some other third person shooters or action games.  Control does feature some incredible destruction physics in combat and in exploration phases.  The destruction makes all of your powers and abilities feel real and have a lasting impact on the world around you.Control is kind of structured in a unique way for a single player experience.  There are your aforementioned story and side mission content, but there are random missions where you’re given objectives that must be completed in a certain amount of time. They feel almost like a “daily challenge” that you’ll find in a multiplayer game.  There are challenges that can be tackled for rewards as well.  Kill a certain number of enemies without dying in a certain part of the Oldest House, and you’ll reward you.  Control definitely takes some of the engaging content from multiplayer games in terms of challenges and introduces them in a way that makes sense for a single player game.  The rewards are upgrade points and materials that will allow you to craft personal mods, weapon mods, and different weapon forms for the Service Weapon.The Service Weapon does start out as a pistol, but it can evolve into multiple things.  While the actual size and shape of it changes only slightly, the firing mechanics and bullets that come out of it differ drastically from a beam to a burst rifle, or shotgun.  So long as you’re spending points on upgrading the weapon you’ll have no shortage of ways to kill enemies.  You can equip two of the weapon forms at once, and then outfit the weapon with up to three different mods which give you various buffs that compliment your playstyle.  There’s no shortage of these progression and upgrade items Control.  In fact, there’s actually quite a lot of loot in the game if you’re looking for it. There is a nice ramp of progression in the game from start to finish where the abilities that you learn and weapons you are using definitely make you feel more powerful in the end game than you did when you were bumbling around the halls of the Oldest House trying to piece together why you are there in the first place.Control is definitely a stunner when it comes to visuals and presentation, but on a technical level on the Xbox One X the game really feels like its pushing the console to its limits.  Taking away from the fun at times were smaller things like the map not loading when trying to pull it up until waiting for 15-20 seconds.  This in itself makes navigating the world more of a chore than it has to be.  Then there’s fast travel and loading into a new control point.  These points are effectively the checkpoints in the game and when you reach one or rest at one you’ll respawn from there if you happen to die.  Each and every single time I loaded into a new control point there was significant frame rate drops and slow down that was visible on screen on the Xbox One X.  It’s became pretty disappointing as the game got harder because it was a stark contrast from the rest of the game.  That’s not to say that Control didn’t chug at other spots.  Put too many enemies on the screen and the Xbox One X just felt like it was overloaded with the enemy counts and the ongoing effects.  It didn’t take away from my experience too much, but it’s definitely noticeable in a game as stylish as Control.Anyone that liked or loved the Quantum Break or Alan Wake games will most certainly enjoy Control.  Remedy has certainly embraced their artistic sides for this game, taking more risks with their story telling than their last couple of games and doubling down on their penchant for including live actors as a story telling device.  If you’re not quite sure what to expect, it’s a dark, twisted, weird world full of things that don’t make any sense.   At times this feels ok, and refreshing that you don’t quite know where it’s going to end up, but it can be a little disappointing.  One thing’s for sure, it’s definitely a hell of a ride from start to finish.Control is definitely Remedy’s best game since Alan Wake.  The sheer variety in the gameplay and fantastic presentation go a long way in making this an enjoyable experience.  The weird story and setting does a great job of setting the hook at the onset, but the payoff was a little underwhelming.
