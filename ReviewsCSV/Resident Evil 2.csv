Buy it Humble / SteamOne of the most remarkable things about this Resident Evil 2 remake is that it makes zombies—the slow, shambling, groaning kind—exciting again. The undead in this game are incredible, horrible things: shuffling lumps of bloody meat who batter down doors, tumble through broken windows, and lunge hungrily from the shadows. They're physical and clumsy and an absolute joy to kill—if you have the ammunition to spare.Shoot a leg off and they keep coming, dragging themselves along the floor, reaching at you with pale, clawing hands. Turn a corner, and as your flashlight beam catches their glassy white eyes they screech and trudge towards you, arms outstretched, jaws slung with glistening blood. They don't sprint or explode or sprout thrashing parasites like they do in newer Resident Evil games. They just moan and lurch and grab, and there's something enjoyably back-to-basics about that—a feeling that echoes through every claustrophobic hallway of this confident remake.After the subversive, rule-breaking Resident Evil 7, with its grimy Southern Gothic aesthetic and intimate first-person horror, Resident Evil 2 is a return to a more familiar style of game. It's a remake, but it's never a slave to the source material, adding or cleverly remixing enough elements to make it feel brand new. You can still play as two characters—Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield—and a few fan favourite bosses and locations have been recreated. But even moments of fan service are given some kind of interesting twist or fresh angle, which is, honestly, not what I expected from this remake at all.Graphics options Anti-aliasing (FXAA/TAA/FXAA+TAA/SMAA), texture quality, texture filter quality (anisotropic 2-16x), subsurface scattering, contact shadows, screen space reflections, particle lighting quality, ambient occlusion (SSAO limited/SSAO full/HDAO/HBAO+), motion blur, graphics API (DX11/DX12)Performance With a GTX 1080, 16GB of RAM, and an i5-6600K overclocked to 4.0GHz I was able to play Resident Evil 2 at 1440p/60fps on almost max settings, and it ran smoothly—albeit with some judder when sprinting into a large, open area such as the RPD main hall.The grand, imposing Raccoon City Police Department was always a great setting, but the shift to three dimensions makes it magnificent. While the original game relied on fixed camera angles and the distant moan of unseen zombies to build fear, the remake uses light, shadow, and layout to get under your skin. Some parts of the station have been plunged into darkness, forcing you to pick through the gloom with a flashlight. The building itself is a labyrinth of blind corners, shadowy recesses, and warren-like corridors, creating a constant feeling of apprehension and unease.The station is essentially a giant box of puzzles, and an absence of objective markers, beyond a few marked points of interest, means you have to draft a mental map as you play. At first most of the building is locked up tight, or obstacles such as the burning wreck of a crashed helicopter block the way forward. But as you explore you find items that let you delve deeper, and slowly but surely the maze of halls, offices, atriums, and stairwells starts to feel familiar. I also like how dead zombies stay put, even after reloading a save, as I'd often use their corpses as a kind of macabre breadcrumb trail.But navigating the station and deciphering its many riddles and puzzles is only half the battle. The zombies, as much fun as they are to scrap with, can take a hell of a beating. Their health seems to be randomised, meaning that you can empty ten bullets into one and it'll keep crawling after you, while another will be put down permanently by just a few shots. And whichever dice roll governs the chance of an explosive headshot is weirdly stingy. This makes the zombies unpredictable and tenacious, as zombies should rightly be. But it also teaches you a hard lesson that every bullet in this remake is precious, and if you can slip past an enemy rather than killing it, you probably should.Then there's the Tyrant, a hulking great mutant in a trench coat (and a hat, which you can shoot off) for whom gunfire is little more than a minor inconvenience. At certain points in the game this merciless, invincible killing machine will hunt you around the station with grim persistence. You can track his movements by listening to the heavy thud of his footsteps, but other than blinding him with a flashbang, evasion is your only real option. He's also attracted to gunfire, which adds further weight to decisions involving fighting regular zombies. Do you waste ammo and risk alerting the Tyrant?Ink ribbons? ✓

The whole game is third-person, similar to Resident Evil 4, but that doesn't make exploring the RPD building any less tense.Original music? X
The remake has its own new score, but if you buy the 'Deluxe Edition' you get the option to replace it with the classic tunes.The way he walks slowly towards you, unflinching and emotionless, is genuinely unsettling—especially when he suddenly appears at the end of a long corridor. And he's always lurking near items you need to progress, which is brilliantly cruel. But I would have liked more ways to interact with him, because eventually these run-ins start to feel rather one-note, and the fear can mutate into frustration. Even the ability to throw something to distract him would have made these sections more interesting, but as it stands the concept feels underdeveloped.Similar to Resident Evil 4, the difficulty of the game adapts as you play. How it actually works is obscured, but whatever's going on behind the scenes, the balancing is quite masterful. For the entire nine hours it took me to finish my first run as Leon, I felt constantly on the verge of catastrophic failure. I always had a handful of bullets, little or no health items, and I kept wondering if I'd backed myself into an inescapable rut. But I'd always scrape through, and it's hugely impressive how the game managed to maintain this knife-edge tension from start to finish.The good news is that if you sacrifice ammo to clear an area, it'll stay clear. More zombies can spill through open windows, but you can block these up with wooden boards. This gives you some breathing room, especially when you're being chased by the Tyrant. The last thing you need is zombies clawing at you when you're trying to run to safety. Counter-weapons can also tip the balance. If you have a grenade or a combat knife in your inventory and something grabs you while you're low on health, you'll avoid death: stabbing them with the blade or shoving a grenade in their mouth. So the game isn't completely relentless in its attempts to sabotage you, but for every inch it gives you, it rudely snatches one right back.It's never really that scary, though. Unnerving, tense, and sometimes overwhelmingly stressful, sure, but there's nothing particularly understated or psychological about it. But that was always Resident Evil's thing: zombie dogs crashing loudly through windows rather than the psycho-sexual mind-beasts of Silent Hill. Still, Resident Evil 7 had some effectively surreal, eerie moments, and I would have liked some of that to make its way into this remake. If you can't deal with the stress, there is an 'assisted' difficulty option that adds generous auto-aim and makes a small amount of health regenerate automatically. But, honestly, the game just isn't very exciting when your item box is heaving with an abundance of spare shotgun shells and healing herbs.As an evolution, and a celebration, of vintage Resident Evil, you couldn't ask for much moreWhen you finish your first playthrough, you've really only seen half of what the game has to offer. The second uses the same locations and has many of the same story beats, but the puzzles are different, enemy types and locations are mixed up, and you take a different route through each of the game's three major locations. What I love about this so-called 'B' scenario is how the game uses your knowledge of the setting against you. Walking into the RPD main hall as Claire, a protected haven for Leon, and seeing zombies in there was a fun subversion. It's just a shame the intensity of the Tyrant is amped up to such a preposterous degree. He's constantly looming over your shoulder, which I ultimately found a bit annoying.As a longtime fan of the original Resident Evil 2, I enjoyed the remake's many self-aware attempts to clarify some of the more abstract stuff in the game—such as why a sewer system is powered by plugs shaped like chess pieces, or why a police station would inexplicably theme its keys and locks around playing card suits. There are other cute references to the old games to find as well, but they're pretty subtle and don't feel forced. This could have easily been a game targeted squarely at diehard fans, but if this is your first Resident Evil you could get your head around everything in minutes—another example of how refreshingly simple the remake is. The story is really no more complicated than: zombies everywhere, get to safety. Which makes even the relatively pared-down narrative of Resident Evil 7 seem overly complex.Some of the voice acting and writing are pretty bad, and not 'fun bad' like in the old PlayStation games: just regular bad. The second act, which takes place in a dingy sewer, slows the action down to a crawl. And I was glad when the section where you play as Ada Wong, solving hacking puzzles while the Tyrant stalks you, was over. But otherwise, this is pretty much the ultimate refinement of the classic Resident Evil formula—but with the added intensity of RE4's slick, dynamic over-the-shoulder combat. The result is a game that is comfortably among the best in the series, and a thrilling survival horror experience in its own right. It's not as surprising as RE7, but as an evolution, and a celebration, of vintage Resident Evil, you couldn't ask for much more.A tense, challenging, and beautiful remake of a classic survival horror game, and with enough fresh ideas to make it feel excitingly new.If it’s set in space, Andy will probably write about it.

Eurogamer,"Raccoon tale.You know you're playing a good Resident Evil game when you need to keep a pen and a piece of scrap paper close at hand. Sitting on the first open page of my notepad, in a frantic scrawl, are rudimentary diagrams with numbers sticking out at odd angles, repeating three letter codes, bizarre rune patterns, abbreviated riddles, safe-cracking combinations, random running tallies, and then sometimes just the odd word, number or phrase followed with a bemused question mark. Lion statue? Stained glass? Locker room? Keypad? This is the frenzied, stream of consciousness-style note-taking of someone deep down a Resident Evil rabbit hole. As an old-school Resident Evil fan, I couldn't be happier. Calling this modern Resident Evil 2 a remake feels like an undersell. Yes, it's a faithful recreation of the 1998 survival horror classic, but it has been rebuilt completely from the ground up, resurrecting iconic locations like the Raccoon City Police Station using Resident Evil 7's RE Engine. And the RPD has never looked better. From the detailed character models and animations to the way your quivering torchlight illuminates the glistening entrails of what used to be a cop, this game looks incredible. Certain elements of the art museum-turned-police station have been reshuffled and reimagined to make sense in a photorealistic environment and for a modern audience, but though this is not the police station as it was in the original Resident Evil 2, it's the police station as you remember it. A grand gilded entrance hall making way for a dozen twisted corridors and antechambers, layered and meted out through keys and trinkets that only get more bizarre as the story continues. The zombies and the corporate espionage are all well and good, but the original game was memorable in a good part due to the station's starring role as both your place of refuge and your prison. Despite the change from fixed camera angles to a third-person over the shoulder perspective, it's a testament to the layout that locations still manage to be both claustrophobic and oppressive. Even the larger, more open spaces like the main police station reception aren't wasted, as these are often put to use by giving you line of sight to a pursuing enemy as you try to shake them on your way through to another interconnecting hallway. You do get a good feel for where everything is after a few loops around the building, but even veteran players would be lost without the map screen, which mercifully logs all the most pertinent information as you play, including the locations of items you've seen but haven't picked up, safes or lockers you've yet to crack open, windows you've boarded and doors that have yet to be unlocked, along with which key or item you need to open them up. It's one of the places the game's lineage shines through most and you're going to need to get on board with the micromanagement of it all - regularly casting back to your map screen, flipping through in-game files, opening up your inventory to examine items and find clues as to their usefulness. A feature that very much comes in handy but in hindsight I think I relied upon a little too much is the game's habit of marking a room red on the map when it still has secrets for you to uncover, and blue once you've squeezed it for every last item or ammo clip it's hiding. You can get into a bad habit of constantly flipping back and checking the status of this colour-co-ordination on the map screen instead of simply exploring things at your own pace, but it's also worth bearing in mind that files and various other reading materials are often crucial for seeing Resident Evil's bigger picture, and these do not show up on the map in any shape or form - you just have to keep your eyes peeled for them yourself. No matter how well you explore, how many enemies you defeat and how many puzzles you solve, however, the game will still have more surprises up its sleeve by the time you first see the credits roll. Upon starting your game of Resident Evil 2, you'll be asked which character you'd like to play as - rookie cop Leon S. Kennedy or obscenely capable college student Claire Redfield. Seeing the campaign through as either one or the other, you'll be meeting unique characters, fighting different enemies and wielding specialist weapons. Upon completing that campaign, you'll be prompted to begin a New Game '2nd Run,' a follow-up scenario featuring the other character where the ending and certain parts of the game have been changed. It's only after completing this second run that you'll get the 'true ending' of the game, and after this second play through you'll also unlock The Fourth Survivor mode and the 2nd Run scenario for your first character. So, just like the original Resident Evil 2, you can play up to four full length campaigns with varying enemy placements and puzzle solutions every time. The story beats don't vary wildly between first and second run-throughs with the same characters (and the locations don't really vary at all), but there are subtle differences here and there. Combine this with additional challenges to unlock bonus assets and artwork and a hardcore difficulty featuring stronger enemies and the need to use an ink ribbon consumable item to save, means there's plenty to keep classic Resident Evil fans coming back for third or fourth helpings. For reference, it took me roughly seven hours to complete both my first and second campaign, first as Claire and then as Leon. The divergent story paths will take you through pretty much the exact same areas, particularly in the latter half of the game, but Resident Evil 2 makes sure to switch up the gameplay with different weapons, different key item placements and different puzzle solutions. Most situations, in other words, will not be exactly as you first experienced them (except for, oddly, safe code combinations, which carry over wholesale into 2nd run playthroughs). Both Claire and Leon's scenarios flesh out their individual storylines, but in a new addition to this retelling both Ada Wong and Sherry Birkin are playable for short sections this time around during Leon and Claire's campaigns respectively. Ada's sequence is a little more involved than her playable section in the original game and features a unique hacking gadget that sounds great in theory but isn't all that fun to wield, while Sherry plays an elaborate game of Hide and Seek in a spooky orphanage - as if there's any other kind. These are only very brief detours from the main campaigns they feature in and mechanically, each is very hit and miss in its own way, and yet they both serve as a welcome palate cleanser and quick change of pace to the central campaign. Playing as Claire and Leon, your time is split between navigating your way around and away from lunging enemies, exercising an itchy, tasty trigger finger when necessary and using your capable yet delicious brains to advance deeper into the city of the dead. As a practiced zombie-killer, I of course know that the fastest way to an efficient kill is with a headshot, but often, even with the most basic fodder in Resident Evil 2, one or even two headshots isn't enough to bring them down permanently. This means that even on standard difficulty, you'll soon find that there are far more enemies than you have bullets, so often you may have to swallow your pride and simply run away. If the zombie is somewhere you'll be passing through with any kind of regularity, however, like a police station thoroughfare, you'll want to at least immobilise them to an extent, by taking off their legs and/or arms.There's a definite sadistic pleasure to be had in this, too - as satisfying as it is to land a perfect headshot right between the eyes, the act of popping off a zombie's limbs one by one and seeing them fall with a wet slop onto the polished marble floor of the police station reception offers its own grim fun. It's a small act of genius that this game allows you to move and shoot, as you'd expect from any modern third person action title, but in a subtle callback to the game's survival horror roots, shooting is refined this time out in that by standing still for a few seconds, the reticule tightens to a pinpoint and you become far more accurate. It's a way of honouring the series' past without sacrificing the kind of gunplay we're used to in 2019, and this Resident Evil 2 is filled with similar smart tweaks, where things have been refined and reframed, but the spirit of survival horror is left very much intact.Of course, with some enemies, running is and was always the only option. The Tyrant T-00 (just like in the original, he's never referred to as Mr X in-game) is a formidable foe, but he won't stalk you for the entirety of Resident Evil 2, as some players initially feared. There are certain portions he'll show up for and certainly stress you out during, but this mechanic doesn't outstay its welcome, nor does it definitively block curious players from exploring every inch of the RPD at their own leisure. He's still a horribly imposing and unpredictable presence, though there are moments it does feel unfair that when cornered by him in a dead-end corridor, there's no way to avoid him taking a swing at you other than unloading a couple of bullets into his head to momentarily stun him. Part of Resident Evil's challenge is weighing up the risk versus reward of travelling back through an infested area knowing full well that you may well end up having to use a healing item or spend more bullets than you can technically afford. That is, of course, part of the game's long-lasting appeal and though this Resident Evil 2 is a beautiful and at times incredibly modern-feeling game, beneath its new and impeccably polished trappings you can still feel the beating heart of the classic and increasingly aged framework it's built on. But that framework is precisely what made the original Resident Evil 2 such a stone cold classic, and though some story beats have been streamlined and some gameplay mechanics have been embellished or added to, this is a reimagining that sticks remarkably close to its source material. Even better, it toes the line between schlocky and scary that the older Resident Evil games managed so well, and does so in perhaps one of the most atmospheric settings ever to grace a survival horror game. It's good to be back in the RPD. Just be sure to bring a pen and paper with you.

Find out more about our reviews policy.Oh the things I yelled out when the Resident Evil 2 Remake dropped a zombie on me from the ceiling. Who puts zombies in the ceiling? I’m also sure I developed an entirely new dimensional plane of swearing at several points. This lovingly-crafted remake perfectly recaptures what made the original great, which is mainly putting you in a small room with too many monsters and not enough bullets; seesawing from tense exploratory poking through dark blood stained corridors one minute, to oh so much screaming and flailing the next.    Resident Evil 2 guide | Best Resident Evil 2 guns |Resident Evil 2 Mr Raccoon locations | Resident Evil 2 Safe codes | Resident Evil 2 locker codes | How to get the Resident Evil 2 shotgun and grenade launcher | Resident Evil 2 Film Roll locations | Resident Evil 2 key locations| Resident Evil 2 medallion locations| How to solve the Resident Evil 2 chess plug puzzle | Find the Resident evil 2 hip pouch locationsWhat’s good about this modern reincarnation is how it honours all the original’s ideas but builds on it using today's gaming capabilities and vocabulary, taking the essence of the 1996 PS1 era Resident Evil and making it feel like it was always on PS4. Just as in the original this follows rookie cop Leon S Kennedy and motorcycling student Claire Redfield as they get caught up in zombie outbreak and uncover the truth behind the pharmaceutical company, Umbrella, that's responsible for it. The plot, characters and locations are all largely the same, the Remake has just spruced up the looks, camera and gameplay to better suit today’s 4K standards. As you’d hope, the zombies are the real stars here. They moan, they shuffle, they peel: skin sloughing off and cracked bones releasing broken limbs to the floor as flesh stretches and snaps. A few well-placed bullets leave wet, schlepping meat bags that relentlessly drag themselves towards you. It’s beautifully horrific, creating some of the best undead I’ve seen in anything for a while. It captures both the obvious and immediate threat of a ravenous undying corpse, and the sad sight of a broken, roadkill mess of meat dragging itself pitifully towards you; mewing as a useless jaw works for a meal it can never reach. I’ve wasted so much time just watching them scrape around, just to enjoy the spectacle. Or to see just how much damage they can actually take. (If you’re interested it’s possible to have a zombie with no arms and legs that still writhes on the floor trying to reach you.) Other, more dangerous monsters, like the Licker (a predatory, skinless beasts with a lengthy, razor sharp tongue) are just as terrifying but will always play second fiddle to the true stars of the series. When the undead aren’t jumping out at you, or leaving a trail of themselves as they advance, they add a persistent tension by their unpredictable inability to completely die. Corpses can lie, unmoving for hours, on the floor, all but forgotten until you hear an ‘Uhrrrrrrrrr’ in the dark and the sound of something getting up. It creates a constant unease that bubbles in the background of the quieter sections - long moments of peace that lull you into a false sense of security just long enough to mess you up. Because you’ve got limited supplies - scarce reserves of ammo and healing - it forces you to think carefully about how you deal with threats. For the most part you’ll be balancing careful resource management, jump scares and the tense, unpleasant promise of a new, dark room - all of which can collapse into chaos with one misstep or when the indestructible Tyrant appears, stomping relentlessly after you. All those undead you thought you’d save a bullet on suddenly become obstacles as you panic, and it’s moments like that you really get a sense of just how likely you’d be able to survive an actual zombie apocalypse. In the first half the atmosphere this creates is wonderfully macabre and jumpy, full of classic Ghost Train-style scares you totally knew were coming as you trundle along its rails. The initial police station is a beautifully crafted area full of blood splattered walls, debris strewn corridors and smashed windows, creating a pensive atmosphere as your narrating torch tells a story with questioning sweeps. Then something moves in the shadows and there’s shooting, yelling and frantic searches for an exit - at times Resident Evil 2 Remake plays like the best season of The Walking Dead we’ve had in a long time. As you crisscross the game’s various areas repeatedly to solve things and open doors you realise what an intricately designed puzzle box it all is. Rather than opening Door 1 and moving on to Door 2, this is more about discovering Object A exists, and that it opens Cupboard X, which gets you Thing B that, when examined, pops out Key ‘Who the fuck designed this?’ for Door C waaaay back where you found the first thing. This interlocking design loops back and forth across the map, expanding and accessing new areas with each step you make in the right direction. It rarely wears out its welcome either, because everything is so compact and efficiently laid out. You get lost occasionally, scanning the in-game map searching for some clue or corner you’ve missed, but rarely for long and the challenge is always a rewarding one when that light bulb goes off. The opening intricacy of the Police Station is a peak though. The later areas have a similar sense of design and are great to explore and work out, but lack the scale and finesse by comparison. As you progress, levels decrease in size and complexity, which does help to keep the focus and pace up but also feels like the later stages were curtailed in some way. For example, there are Blue Herbs scattered throughout the entire game that can cure poisoning, which is an effect that literally only happens in one single room. Were there more reasons to have them originally?As with the original game you’ll need to play through twice to see everything, as completing the game with one character opens up a slightly altered playthrough with the other. You’ll get different weapons, altered puzzles and new cutscenes, as well as skipping or swapping some sections and steps to speed things up. Both Both Leon and Claire have different secondary characters they encounter, with their own playable sections. So there’s enough new stuff and variation to make a replay feel fresh. Plus what you learn from the first time around radically changed your approach and awareness when you go back. 12 essential Resident Evil 2 Remake tips to know before you playIn terms of other callbacks honouring the old games the boss fights are still… well, basically a bit shit. The slow, methodical controls that work so well in fostering a sense of manageable vulnerability against zombies become fumblingly sluggish against faster moving enemies and bosses. In those scenario it’s less about vulnerability and more about howling at the screen as your character corners like a Roomba stuck on a rug and fails to dodge a huge swiping claw from off screen. Classic Resident Evil has always been a bit like that though, making these encounters more about taking a couple of goes to get the ‘trick’ you need to win rather than pulling off a slick set of moves. There’s also one encounter involving a swinging shipping container that’s a disaster. It takes place in a tiny area barely bigger than the monster you’re fighting and really highlights the limits of the controls.But one kink doesn’t kill a classic and it’s interesting to see how much of the old game comes through. Limited movement that leaves you exposed, scant resources and meticulous puzzle solving layers are all mainstays of the original and after the total reinvention of Resident Evil 7’s first person reboot this proves that those ideas still have legs.

Metro GameCentral,"Capcom’s remake of their 1998 survival horror classic is one of the best-looking games of the year, but how does it all play out?Considering its primary goal is to scare its players silly, with an atmosphere of lingering horror and dripping gore, Resident Evil is a very endearing, loveable series of games. They can shift from sheer terror to charming absurdity and back again without any of the tonal whiplash you’d normally expect, and they’ve managed to repeat that feat time and again for the majority of their entries. The first sequel may be 21 years old now but it’s still a fan favourite and in this new release it’s finally got the remake it deserves.Even if you’ve never played the original Resident Evil (and we strongly advise the existing remake if you haven’t) you’ll probably be aware that it involves zombies in an isolated mansion, with a sci-fi explanation rather than a supernatural one. Although Resident Evil 2 is set in Racoon City, during the midst of a mass outbreak, it follows the template of the first game very closely, with the first third of the taking place in a baroque-looking police station that used to be an art museum.Although subsequent games began to expand the formula the first sequel was just the same thing but bigger and, arguably, better. That might have made a remake seem redundant but if you’ve already played the 1-Shot demo you’ll know that rather than replicating the fixed camera views of the original this uses a Resident Evil 4 style over-the-shoulder camera and state-of-the-art modern graphics. And it is glorious.As in the original, the remake has an unusual set-up, in that right from the start you can chose to play as either rookie cop Leon S. Kennedy or ordinary civilian (and sister of Chris from the first game) Claire Redfield. They each have their own campaigns, that will likely take you about eight to 10 hours on your first playthrough, roughly a third of which is unique to them. Leon becomes involved with a mysterious woman called Ada and is relentlessly pursued by an indestructible monster named Mr X. Claire, meanwhile, runs into a young girl named Sherry and through her learns more about the people behind the outbreak.Each character also has a different set of weapons to collect but the first few hours are largely the same for both. You begin the game with only a few bullets to your name and must carefully explore the police station, searching for various keys and items and engaging in some highly impractical logic puzzles involving locked doors, desks, safes, and lockers. Collecting plastic books from the library to put in the arms of a statute that drops a giant red gem is patently absurd but we’re very glad it’s all been kept – and in some cases expanded on – because silliness is all part of the Resident Evil DNA.And yet this is the first entry since Resident Evil 7’s soft reboot, so the remake takes the same slightly more realistic approach as that game. The difference is subtle – characters’ clothing now resembles something a human being might actually wear and at least one of the minor monsters has been removed for being too unrealistic – but the biggest difference is that the script has been completely rewritten. Instead of the pure cheese of the original it’s now perfectly ordinary, if sometimes amusingly on-the-nose.And yet because the implausible story is still largely the same, and because the puzzles seems even more incongruous in this modern age, there’s still a welcome tang of Cheddar to the whole endeavour, even without bad dialogue or voice-acting to laugh at.The combat works largely the same as Resident Evil 4, 5, and 6, albeit with access to far less ammo than those games. This is especially problematic because zombies can now take several shots to the head (turning it into a disgusting ball of gore as you blast away) before they even think of falling down, and can get up multiple times if you don’t finish them off or run away. They can also follow you through doors, a fact that they announce by mindlessly pounding on them before smashing their way through.There’s also Mr X, the golem-like monster in a trenchcoat who became the precursor to Nemesis from Resident Evil 3. Once he’s introduced to the story he follows you everywhere and cannot be killed, only stopped in his tracks for a few seconds. You can usually hear him even when he’s not around and he adds a huge amount of tension to the police station section.He does appear elsewhere, depending on who you’re playing as, but it has to be said that the police station is, and has always been, the best bit of the game. Or at least it’s certainly the scariest, with the worryingly quiet corridors that creak under foot and the ominous shadows that suggest disaster at every turn. Hearing the fateful roar of a licker (who we didn’t realise before, but are blind) froze us in fear every time, both in the real world and in the game, as you discover there are worse things in the game than just zombies.For those that are familiar with the original there’s nothing in terms of new content that’s quite as interesting as Lisa Trevor from the Resident Evil 1 remake, but the original design is still expanded upon and shifted around in some interesting ways. This includes a number of new story beats that take advantage of the more serious dialogue, even though the rest of what’s going on is still so over-the-top.The graphics for all this are fantastic, with deep blacks and thick shadows that make you wish the whole game took place with the lights off. Especially as that helps to make the wet, gooey viscera slathered all over the walls even more terrifying in your torchlight. The facial animation is great too, giving real personality to what were previously very basic characters. The only problem is what appears to be a graphical glitch affecting some reflections, which is particularly evident towards the end of the game. It looks like the sort of bug you get with PC graphics card when the driver’s not up to date, so we hope it’s something that will get fixed quickly and hopefully before launch.It’s certainly the only thing close to a flaw in the presentation, in what is almost a perfect remake. What qualms we have are largely with the original design, in both its similarity to the first game and the uneven pacing of the second half. Some might also balk at the old school design, particularly the puzzles and relatively small map, but that’s part of what makes it feel so distinct and we wouldn’t change it at all – or at least not while they’re still making new entries as well.Once you beat both campaigns you unlock a B story for both Leon and Claire, referred to here as a 2nd run. They are quite different from the first campaigns but they don’t change depending on your save data, as happened with the original ‘zapping system’. That’s not necessarily any great loss but you might have hoped that some more high-tech equivalent could’ve been created. But instead they’re just linear campaigns, that unlock another couple of bonus modes afterwards.Alan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNew Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart bundle is £50 off reveals leakTop 10 new Halloween board games and tabletop RPGs 2023Terrifying, goofy, nerve-wrecking, and endearingly earnest – Resident Evil 2 is, and always has been, an unlikely mixture, but the sweat taste of horror has never been so well balanced. That includes the difficulty level which does offer unlimited saves and a super helpful map but has very little sign-posting and trusts its players to work things out for themselves. Even on Normal mode the game’s fairly hard and while a calm head will get you through most encounters, planning ahead and managing your limited inventory is vital.The game adds a lot of new features and elements, and of course the amazing new graphics, but it still seems amazing that such an old design – modernised as it may be – can feel so fresh and exciting today. Whether you’ve played the original 100 times or this is your first ever taste of the franchise it’s a hugely entertaining standalone experience, that everyone can enjoy. Resident Evil 2 was always a fan favourite and this remake ensures it’s going to stay that way.In Short: A fantastic big budget remake of one of Resident Evil’s most popular entries, that manages to look state-of-the-art but in terms of gameplay finds a perfect balance of old and new.Pros: Superb visuals and tense combat manage to have their cake and eat it in terms of horror atmosphere and straight action. Excellent level design and understated tactical elements.Cons: The first half is definitely better than the second, and very similar to the first game, but that’s more the fault of the original design than the remake.Score: 9/10Formats: PlayStation 4 (reviewed), Xbox One, and PC

Game Informer,"For more than a decade, Resident Evil has felt like a franchise struggling to find its identity. The seminal Resident Evil 4 put a greater focus on action, but subsequent entries lost their luster. Resident Evil 7 was a major course correction but still felt like a radical reinvention that was finding its footing. Fortunately, Capcom might have finally found the magic once again. This brilliant homage to Resident Evil 2 not only revitalizes many of the survival horror elements that put Resident Evil on the map, it paves a brilliant path for the future of the franchise.In its era, Resident Evil 2 was the pinnacle of survival horror. While the original Resident Evil established a formula, its sequel raised the stakes in nearly every way with tense exploration and nail-biting action. In 1998, Resident Evil 2’s action was as intense as its atmosphere was horrifying, so it became a benchmark for PS One horror. Unfortunately, Capcom’s classic has aged about as poorly as a zombie-eaten corpse.Capcom’s remake gives Racoon City a much-needed facelift, but a new third-person perspective does even more to update Resident Evil’s action. This remake returns to the series’ slower-paced roots. Thankfully, slowing down the shootouts doesn’t diminish Resident Evil’s intensity. On the contrary, Resident Evil’s action feels better than it has in years, and its smooth shooter controls are incredibly intuitive. Zombies shamble forward like herky-jerky wind-up toys. These animations are unnerving, but they also create an exciting metagame in which you must time your shots perfectly to hit these brain eaters in the brainpan. If you miss your shot, they keep stumbling forward, meaning that even two flanking zombies can pose a challenge if you’re off your A-game.Resident Evil 2’s new visuals also create a darker, more haunting vibe. For those who think Resident Evil has lost its teeth, Resident Evil 2 might be the most intense game in the series. The original Resident Evil 2’s bold colors look cartoonish today, but the remake’s atmosphere is foreboding. Zombie heads pop in a sickening shower of brain bits. Grotesque body horrors skitter across the walls and ceilings. The station’s halls echo with steady footfalls. I normally have an incredibly steady hand, but Resident Evil 2 had me jumping at shadows, and I couldn’t escape the feeling of being stalked.Resident Evil 2 is also much more than a remake. In a lot of important ways, this feels like a brand-new experience. Fans will recognize locations within Racoon City’s police department and its sprawling sewer system, but Capcom cleverly reworked the entire layout so they feel fresh. Many of the environmental puzzles are more realistic, and moments like rewiring an electrical grid or looking for environmental clues to a combination lock offer a refreshing break from the action.Another big change from the original game is the removal of the zapping system. In the PlayStation original, players’ actions with one character could affect events in a second playthrough with the other character. While the zapping system is gone, this modern update has a mode called 2nd Run, which allows you to play through the campaign a second time with the other character. These two campaigns don’t talk to each other as in the PlayStation game, but 2nd Run challenges you to take a different path through the station and gives you a few new tools to use in the process, such as a rapid-fire revolver that burns through high-grade ammo. Leon and Claire’s stories are also very different, so this feature adds extra incentive to play through the game a second time. Fortunately, both playthroughs felt significantly different, and I was excited to see what happened to both protagonists.Over the years, Capcom has experimented with several different approaches to Resident Evil, but this is one approach I hope gets revisited. Resident Evil 2 not only looks great, it plays well, and it forces you into a series of dark encounters that are a total rush. Resident Evil is finally running on all cylinders.

   on January 28, 2019 at 8:01AM PSTReliving familiar frights can often make for a less-than-exciting horror experience. But with the remake of Resident Evil 2, Capcom shows respect for the original while also going to great lengths to give the macabre atmosphere and tense gameplay a noticeable upgrade. In doing so, this revamp of the classic survival horror game shows that the series can still offer a terrifying experience like no other.You once again play as either Leon Kennedy or Claire Redfield. A viral outbreak has unleashed hordes of zombies and other grotesque monsters upon Raccoon City, leading to a series of dangerous and nightmare-inducing encounters for the two characters. While both protagonists' storylines have similar plots and take place in the same locations, there are different supporting characters and unique challenges in each that set the two playthroughs apart.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Resident Evil 2 Video ReviewIn traditional Resident Evil fashion, you're tasked with surviving through the night and overcoming the nightmarish creatures and devious puzzles found throughout the infested streets of the city, the tight, dimly lit halls of the Police Station, and in the subterranean passages below. RE2 is a great mix of the understated survivalist approach from the original games and the tactile, reflex-oriented gameplay from more recent entries. It's very much a game about escalation; as your resources dwindle and the monsters become fearsome and more elaborate, the pressure is always mounting as the story progresses, and each moment feels just a bit more desperate than the last. Even the smallest of victories can feel like major wins in RE2, and you'll often find yourself onto the next struggle before you know it.While those who played the original game will enter with an idea of what's to come, the remake does a lot to refresh certain encounters and locations. Though many locales and their layouts are similar--save for the addition of a brand-new area and a new monster to deal with--the events therein are new. Jump scares don't trigger when you expect them to, or a room that once spelled certain doom in your head is now a safe haven--but then the question arises: if this room is safe, which room is the real dangerous one?Early Resident Evil games have a reputation for being melodramatic, often unintentionally, but the RE2 remake a more serious tone that makes for a more evocative story. While there is still the undercurrent of the hokey tone from the classics, with the characters cutting the tension with humor when appropriate, the remake's narrative is far more convincing, propped up by some impressive writing and strong performances that help convey urgency and despair. This is especially evident during the more quiet moments, when the protagonists will try to psych themselves up for what's to come. Even minor characters are given additional substance in the remake, with poignant moments given to the doomed police lieutenant Marvin Branagh and gun shop owner Robert Kendo.Both Claire and Leon have two different versions of the campaign, and after finishing the first run for one, you'll be prompted to start a follow-up with the other. Called Second Scenarios, they allow you to see the larger story from a different perspective. Both scenarios are totally isolated from another, and choices therein won't impact the other, but what makes these second runs worthwhile are the different encounters and sub-plots that don't occur in the first. It's a very interesting way to experience the narrative, and with four versions of the campaigns between the two leads--with the first two averaging 12-15 hours--you constantly uncover new details and events that weren't present in the previous playthroughs.Resident Evil 2's more serious tone is further enhanced by the renewed, fantastically atmospheric presentation, which gives familiar details from the classic game more of a pronounced look and feel. Moving away from the static camera angles of the original, everything has been redesigned with over-the-shoulder gameplay in mind, giving more of a palpable and invasive sense of dread when exploring. This is heightened even more by the impeccable audio and visual design of the game, creating an eerie, isolating vibe throughout. In a number of cases, you'll only have the illumination of your flashlight as you walk the dark hallways of the bloody and ruined police station, with the ambient rain and distant monster sounds ramping up the tension. You rarely feel safe in RE2, even when you actually are.The remake's impressive level of detail is consistently noticeable, but especially so during gorey moments. These gruesome encounters channel the same macabre and staccato approach from the classics, but are now honed through the visual luster of modern rendering and animation. As the zombies are the one constant threat throughout, you quickly become accustomed to seeing flesh chip away as you fire off pistol shots, along with watching the undead torn in half by well-placed shotgun blasts. Though RE2 easily proves to be the goriest game of the series, it never comes off as excessive, and the grizzly details all serve to highlight the grim circumstances of the desperate situation.Resident Evil 2's more serious tone is further enhanced by the renewed, fantastically atmospheric presentation...At the beginning, your meager selection of weapons doesn't seem like a match for the game's most intimidating horrors, but there are means available that can give you the upper hand in a lopsided fight. In addition to dismembering enemies with well-aimed shots hindering zombies' speed and offense, you can barricade certain windows to block ravenous undead from entering from outside. While many of these options are simply a temporary solution to a long-term problem, which can make it seem like they're not all that worth taking advantage of, they are helpful in a pinch.While you will no doubt settle into tactics that work well, RE2 throws in some fresh challenges. In one of the game's more tense encounters, you cross paths with the Tyrant, a hulking presence whose footsteps echo throughout the environment. Though it was a serious foe shown in small doses in the original, this imposing force of nature is now more of a persistent threat that actively stalks you during key periods in the story. Simply ducking into another room isn't enough, as it'll quickly follow you in to keep the chase going--similar to the RE3's Nemesis in that regard. If you manage to create enough distance and it loses line of sight, it'll disengage, but will remain lurking throughout the halls. With this dynamic, the Tyrant also makes the common foes you've gotten a handle of become genuine threats once again. As you find yourself trying to stay focused on the stalking figure, it's all too easy to round a corner and run into a group of zombies.Though the Tyrant offers a nerve-wracking surprise during some of these key moments, which makes the feeling of getting the best of it all the more satisfying, there are other times when it can disrupt Resident Evil 2's pacing. This is especially frustrating when you're simply trying to acquire an item or solve a puzzle in a room that the Tyrant and zombies frequent. What should be tense encounters can sometimes become annoying exercises in trying to lure it away, and in some cases it comes off like you're taking advantage of the Tyrant's rather limited AI to do just that. The Tyrant can overstay its welcome, but in most cases, its presence is a constant reminder of the looming threat throughout the game.While RE2 often keeps things serious, it's not all doom and gloom. In addition to occasional references that break the tension, there's also a suite of unlockable content available to the delight of RE fans, including the classic RE2 outfits for both Leon and Claire. After completing the campaign for both characters, you'll unlock a set of bonus modes starring fan-favorites Hunk and Tofu, the later of which is a sentient knife-wielding block of coagulated soy. Both of these extra modes take you on timed gauntlets battling through many intense encounters, with Tofu's mode being the most difficult scenario in the entire game. They also allow for a chance to cut loose against hordes of monsters without the worry of the larger survival-horror mechanics during the main game.Resident Evil 2 is not only a stellar remake of the original, but it's also simply a strong horror game that delivers anxiety-inducing and grotesque situations, topping some of the series' finest entries. But above all, the remake is an impressive game for the fact that it goes all-in on the pure survival horror experience, confidently embracing its horrifying tone and rarely letting up until the story's conclusion. Though Resident Evil 2 has its roots firmly in the past, it reworks the familiar horrors into something that feels brand new and all its own.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"
Polygon,"Filed under:Capcom has remade Resident Evil 2 into something exciting, new, and nostalgicCapcom hasn’t always understood what makes Resident Evil great. Maybe it has never consistently, fully grasped the thing that it has on its hands.That’s been evident since the original Resident Evil 2, which was famously scrapped and restarted well into its development, ultimately becoming a beloved follow-up to a genre-defining game. After that 1998 PlayStation game, however, Capcom’s zombie series has wavered. Resident Evil 4 was a revelation. Its immediate successors, not so much. But the outstanding Resident Evil 7 showed that Capcom had the thoughtfulness to reflect on what made the franchise so beloved in the first place.Polygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences.

If you want curated lists of our favorite media, check out What to Play and What to Watch.Capcom took Resident Evil 7’s design decisions to heart in its remake of Resident Evil 2, which has not been simply polished with slick graphics for modern consoles and computers, but has been completely remade inside and out. It’s no mean feat; the developers of the new Resident Evil 2 have carefully threaded a needle with their new version of a very old thing. Capcom has woven modern mechanics into its groundbreaking sequel, never abandoning what is truly great about the first Resident Evil 2. The result is a fresh, expensive-looking game that evokes the best memories of the PlayStation original, while also being something altogether new.The new Resident Evil 2 begins just like its now-primitive ancestor: Rookie cop Leon Kennedy and college student Claire Redfield trek to the town of Raccoon City in search of answers. The two are united by a chance encounter but quickly separated by a terrible accident. What follows is a fight for survival as both Claire and Leon try to escape the city alive, then find themselves caught up in something much bigger.Resident Evil 2’s main setting, a police station, should be a safe haven for its heroes. It should be stockpiled with weapons, ammunition, and survival gear, the perfect place to wait out a zombie apocalypse. But Claire and Leon arrive weeks into Raccoon City’s ordeal. The entirety of the city’s police force is either dead, zombified, or on the brink of death. Supplies have been expended. The halls run slick with blood. Corpses — it’s unclear if they’re truly dead or reanimated — lay piled around every corner. It is immediately terrifying.The walking dead stalk me through the station — during my first playthrough as Leon — from room to room. They break through windows and doors, upending my expectations about how Resident Evil’s zombies are supposed to behave. I shoot them in the head, missing every third shot because of their unpredictable bobbleheaded movements, but they don’t stay down for long. I’m wasting ammo, constantly. I curse the zombies. I curse my aim. Leon curses too, annoyed or frightened that headshots aren’t working. Rooms I think are clear of threats are somehow inhabited by new zombies when I return to search for something I missed.Resident Evil 2 quickly forces me to get back to behaviors I learned in 1998. Conserve ammo. Run away when I can. Hack at a zombie with a knife until I’m 100 percent sure that thing isn’t getting back up again.The game’s bizarre puzzles likewise take me back to that time. I sprint from room to room in search of a diamond-shaped key for a diamond-shaped lock. I develop rolls of film that reveal a single picture of a padlock combination. A half-eaten police officer dies with a notebook in his hand. The book contains the solution to an elaborate, station-spanning puzzle that requires three medallions culled from three marble statues — and, ludicrously, it’s my only hope of getting out of this place.How does Resident Evil 2 justify all this? Raccoon City’s police department is actually a renovated art museum, and its architect — either a certified genius or an authentic wacko — has devised this series of convoluted puzzles that stand between me and survival. Resident Evil’s puzzles have felt natural in games where the settings were dark-and-stormy-night haunted houses, but set against the background of a municipal police station, they are absurd. I enjoy completing them immensely.While the game’s many puzzles root Resident Evil 2 to its past, virtually everything else is gloriously modernized. Claire and Leon no longer move like tanks, but like modern video game action heroes in third-person view. The police station is beautifully, gruesomely realized. Some rooms are dark as night, lit only by the blaze of Claire’s or Leon’s flashlight. Emergency lighting reflects off the water in flooded hallways. There is trash and rot in the attics, piled-up office furniture blocking pathways, and it’s all very realistic-looking. Claire and Leon themselves look like real human beings, slickly rendered. They become sweaty, dirty, and bloody. They shoot like regular human beings, though, with imperfect aim. On Resident Evil 2’s standard difficulty, there is no aim assistance, a very modern video game convenience that I miss terribly every time I waste precious ammo shooting wildly at zombies. In my second playthrough, as Claire, I play on “assisted” mode, which adds generous aim assistance and automatically regenerating health. Resident Evil 2 is almost too easy, but very enjoyable, on this lower difficulty setting. A “hardcore” mode is available too. It brings with it the requirement that you save the game using ink ribbons — a finite resource — at typewriters, and other punishments I can’t bring myself to endure yet. To play Resident Evil 2 requires a throbbing, constant stress, and to return to ink ribbons at this stage, without having memorized the placement of every item scattered throughout the game, is too much.But Resident Evil 2 begs to be played multiple times over. As with the original version of the game, Capcom has created distinct scenarios for both Claire and Leon. They meet different people on their journey, battle monsters unique to them, and see the story play out in very different ways. I was pleasantly surprised at just how much had changed, and how fresh each side of Resident Evil 2’s story felt from their different perspectives. They each get a “second run” scenario too, so if you complete the game with Leon, you’ll be able to see what Claire was busying herself with during his adventure, and vice versa. Those second runs play out as more condensed horror stories, and each contains its own surprises. Each scenario was worth the time I spent with it.Where Resident Evil 2 falters is when the game gives you control of people that aren’t Claire or Leon. A pair of interludes starring supporting characters Ada Wong and Sherry Birkin offer ostensibly new perspectives, but both are bogged down by dull, trial-and-error tasks. While both characters are essential to the plot, their playable scenarios are unfortunate speed bumps on an otherwise thrumming horror story.Outside of those interruptions, Resident Evil 2 is everything a video game remake should be. It’s faithful in tone and story to its source material, while updating a classic in meaningful ways. It’s exciting in the ways that Resident Evil used to be, when the games were driven not by explosive set-pieces, but a constant sensation of high tension.Umbrella, the sinister corporation at the heart of the horrors in the Resident Evil games, has never exhibited total control over its creations. That’s a lesson at the heart of Resident Evil 2, in which a virus runs amok, culminating in the destruction of Umbrella’s own underground lair — where those zombie-making viruses were conceived.Capcom, on a far less dangerous scale, has not always known how to handle its own creation. After mutating from quaint horror to buffoonish action to back again, the Resident Evil series has been wildly inconsistent. But back-to-back Resident Evil games that showcase the very best of survival horror is evidence that Capcom may have its monster under control. Resident Evil 2 is available Jan. 25 for PlayStation 4, Windows PC, and Xbox One. The game was reviewed using a final “retail” Xbox One download code provided by Capcom.

Kotaku,"There’s a lot to love about the new Resident Evil 2, from its brash bloodiness to the wide variety of experiences packed into the game. Looking over the wreckage of my playthroughs, my own feelings are complicated. It is an exciting and astounding experience, but it feels compromised. Pushes towards modernization through changes to the camera and controls lessen the sense of dread of the original, and the presentation suffers without returning actors to tie it into the larger franchise. It has many excellent parts, but it sometimes struggles to cohere into a satisfying whole.This piece originally appeared 1/22/19. We’ve bumped it today for the game’s release.When the original Resident Evil debuted in 1996, it helped codify a new genre of games. Combining cinematic camera cuts and resilient enemies, it wove a masterful tapestry of isolation and alienation. Its sequel, Resident Evil 2, increased the level of action. As director Hideki Kamiya took charge over Shinji Mikami, an increased emphasis on combat altered how the series approached horror. Resident Evil 2 was not a game of isolation. It was about being overwhelmed. Rushing around a corner could leave the player face to face with numerous zombies. It was a game of deliberate decision-making, of knowing when to commit to combat and when to avoid it.""Jesus Christ, stay back!""Prestige Television RemakeDeliciously bloody, good puzzles, and it's genuinely terrifying to be hunted.Gameplay changes sometimes make things too easy. Certain segments drag on too long.CapcomPS4 (Played), Xbox One, PCLeon's story took about eight hours, Claire's was roughly three. Around 14 hours total with extras and restarts.That 1998 PlayStation sequel has been remade by Kazunori Kadoi and a team of Capcom veterans for a new modern Resident Evil 2 that changes its camera angles and expands parts of the original. These changes give players more control but that sometimes erodes the original version’s tension. It’s a different kind of experience, full of action, gore, and grit but not always as anxiety-inducing.Resident Evil 2 takes place in the zombie-infested Raccoon City. The story follows rookie cop Leon Kennedy and college student Claire Redfield, who is looking for her brother, Resident Evil protagonist Chris Redfield. Leon is drawn into the path of a mysterious femme fatale. Claire takes charge and tries to protect a child. Their stories intersect—players experience one story, then play the other character’s perspective—creating a tapestry of one night’s events in Raccoon City.The remake keeps this narrative frame, but its most radical change presents all of the action in a new camera angle. The early Resident Evil games presented their scenes from fixed camera angles with pre-rendered backgrounds, pulling the camera out to make the player feel smaller or even moving outside of locations to emulate the monster’s perspective. Turning a corner could mean a smash cut to a new angle showing half a dozen zombies. These movements helped create a sense of space and mounting tension. The remake loses a lot of this by moving the camera behind the characters’ shoulders in a perspective that resembles the revolutionary Resident Evil 4 and many modern third-person action games. When this first occurred in RE4, it opened the series to a creative renaissance. Here, it helps evoke the original game’s move towards action but in giving players more control over their characters and centering those characters prominently in the camera frame at all times, the game loses some of the 1998 version’s unease. Changing the camera is a well-motivated attempt to evoke the original game’s action bent, but it has some side effects. It is easy—too easy—to feel powerful in Resident Evil 2, as both the cameras and controls encourage a confident push forward that the original did not always compel. While the Racoon Police Department is dark and foreboding it never feels as harrowing as it did in the original.The remake instead adds tension by making its zombie hordes a resilience and menace unlike anything seen in the series before. Even when playing at the easiest setting, the player needs up to three shots to a zombie’s skull to dispatch of them. Once fallen, zombies can quickly rise again. You might use several bullets to clear a tight pathway only to find your foes have risen again by the time you come around for a return trip. The tougher enemies are initially interesting to fight, but I missed the tension that came from the larger crowds of enemies that swarmed players in the original.This Resident Evil 2 remake, like the original, is generous with ammo. At least on the default difficulty. Players will find themselves able to dispatch most of their enemies to the point of a final death, but their propensity for soaking up bullets also means there will be rooms players avoid because they are too constricted and there are too few bullets remaining.The core aesthetic behind this remake  is a push toward high-fidelity gore and violence. This is not a game for the squeamish, as zombies enthusiastically rip off pieces of flesh, characters have their skulls caved in, and shotguns blast bodies apart. The richness of Resident Evil 2’s viscera helps propel combat. Assaulting a zombie’s flank with knife slashes might result in a sliced off arm while a Licker’s slash could leave a long-lasting gash on your character until they heal. The wounds you are inflicting or that are inflicted upon you give Resident Evil 2’s familiar gameplay a raw tangibility. That helps ground the player in a space and makes threats feel real, but the graphical fidelity is undermined by the game’s controls and the enemies’ lack of intelligence. The player will find that they’re just too capable for these zombies to deal with even as mistakes are punished with bloody death.Claire and Leon can run at a fair speed, snap their guns up quickly for firing, and even have the ability to quickly turn around with a simple button press. Enemies might be bullet sponges but they are easy to avoid or else sneak around. It might be unsettling the first few times a zombie shrieks and identifies your position, but after the fiftieth time running around them, the luster long wears off. The early Resident Evils, including the first version of this game, had so-called “tank controls” that reduced characters’ mobility and enhanced the players’ terror. The new camera angle in the remake increases the agility and decreases the horror. Even when the game introduces Lickers, highly mutated albeit blind monsters, it never quite manages to truly instill horror thanks to how much control the player has over their characters.Alongside plentiful ammo and a lack of isolating camera angles, the early portions of the game are simply not as scary as they could be. Instead of watching confused characters adapt to a terrifying situation, it’s all too easy to feel like a familiar third-person action protagonist. Though this remake is initially less scary than the source material, the original game’s best twist returns and is more frightening than ever.About a third into the game, Mr. X arrives and the entire dynamic changes. (Skip the next three paragraphs if you don’t want to know what that entails.) Mr. X is a Tyrant, a special bioweapon meant to wreak havoc and withstand the toughest conditions. He is dropped into Raccoon City to find a sample of the virus causing the zombie outbreak and he decides that you have it. His arrival into the police station radically alters Resident Evil 2. He will follow you everywhere, chasing you from room to room until he can grab you by the neck and snap your bones. If you elude him, the chase is merely postponed as he wanders the area searching for you. He cannot be killed, although he can be stunned with enough damage. I’ve watched him shrug off high powered handgun rounds and continue to march after being doused with flamethrower fluid. The only time he staggered quickly was when I smashed two acid grenades against his face. That might buy you time to escape but it does you little good when you’re still desperately searching for that last key item.Mr. X breaks the rules, and that rule breaking is Resident Evil 2’s greatest trick. Until this point, zombies are not able to enter safe rooms or breach into the main hall of the police department. Mr. X does whatever he wants, and the moment I learned that is forever burned into my gaming memory. I was waiting in the main hall’s second floor, outside of the library. I needed to enter in order to solve a puzzle where I pushed bookshelves to make a bridge over a broken balcony. Wherever Mr. X walks, he stomps his feet with a tremendous weight. He doesn’t have footsteps. He leaves mini-earthquakes. Behind the library door, I heard him stomp as he looked for me. So I decided to wait until he left. For a moment, the steps died down and then the door opened. Mr. X marched into the main hall, into the space that Resident Evil 2 had stressed was safe, and began to chase me.It was brilliant and horrifying all at once. Like getting chased by Jack Baker in Resident Evil 7 or enduring the ever-possible ambushes of Resident Evil 3’s titular Nemesis, there’s a great sense of disempowerment that comes from being plagued with an implacable foe. Resident Evil 2 almost uniformly empowers the player elsewhere, but that changes whenever Mr. X is around. Knowing that there is no safe spot, knowing that he will find you and you will need to deal with him is panic-inducing. While he sometimes can feel more like nuisance than menace—especially when you simply want to finish a puzzle—his inclusion and the execution therein helps elevate Resident Evil 2 to a genuinely terrifying experience. When it lands its punches, Resident Evil 2 hits like a champ.Resident Evil 2 works best when it is taking risks and altering how players engage with it. It breathes new life into the gameplay by switching character perspectives. A segment as corporate spy Ada Wong turns Leon’s story into a sort of puzzle game, where Ada uses her spy tech to manufacture escape routes from a variety of different deadly situations. More impactfully, Claire’s story leaps perspective to the child Sherry Birkin. Her sequence is part room-escape and part horrifying hide-and-seek as she attempts to escape from the evil police chief, Brian Irons. These moments continue the trend set by Mr. X—they disempower the player and help Resident Evil 2 break away from its more standard action to something more cerebral. These sequences were present in the original game but are given more focus here, creating an ensemble feel that allows the game to explore different modes of interaction. It is one area where the remake clearly surpasses the original.Resident Evil 2 also does a far better job of incorporating puzzles into the mix than contemporaries like Resident Evil 7. Much of this is due to just how dense the police station and adjoining areas are. These locations are packed with keys to find, generators to power up, serums to concoct, and safes to unlock. Often, this is simply a matter of finding the right widget to plug into the correct sprocket but there’s just enough variety here that you’ll find yourself examining items for clues, mentally marking down where initially inaccessible items are, and sitting down to work through genuine brain teasers. None of it is particularly novel but it is masterfully woven into the larger experience and more interesting than just a set of locks and keys. The puzzles help slow the pace into something a bit more introspective. It never quite reaches the sublime mixture of navigation and brain teasing of the original Resident Evil nor its subsequent remake, but these moments help modulate a game whose shift toward traditional combat isn’t sufficient enough to carry the full experience.Resident Evil 2’s variety is commendable, but leaves the game feeling inconsistent as it never seems to settle on a theme. Its jumbled experiences don’t combine into as intelligent a whole as Resident Evil’s remake. That game took a core experience of isolation and added a gothic richness. This Resident Evil 2 remake applies modern sensibilities and experiments and the result is less coherent. That’s not to say that it is a bad experience. In fact, it’s easy to see how many of the design decisions are motivated by a desire to capture the original’s action tone. But Resident Evil 2 mixes its modes to such a degree that while each individual piece is appreciated, it is hard to say if they point towards a purposeful experience. Much of this comes from how generic the proceedings feel in comparison to other games in the franchise. Resident Evil evoked Romero horror and Gothic classics like Frankenstein, Resident Evil 7 leaned into the grindhouse world of The Devil’s Rejects and found footage films. It’s harder to define what Resident Evil 2’s identity is. It might simply be that Resident Evil 2’s identity is Resident Evil 2 itself. That’s fine, but I wish this game had a clearer ethos other than to exist for its own sake.The parts are greater than their sum, and the remake’s lack of visual identity or narrative goals becomes an issue as things progress. Resident Evil 7 leveraged its schlock-film influences to tell a story about the nature of families. It used the severing of limbs and increasing levels of mold as visual metaphors for separation anxiety and wrath. The Resident Evil remake mixed gothic images and hard-cutting camera angles to create a sort of modern day horror. It mixed high luxury with isolation, and even expanded on the series mythos with new terrors like the face-wearing Lisa Trevor. The Resident Evil 2 remake never manages to really explore its themes or build out its world. (A recently announced DLC called Ghost Survivors will feature new character perspectives and will hopefully add some extra narrative depth.) Claire’s story takes steps in that direction, but falls short of telling the Aliens-esque story of motherhood that it could. None of this prevents the remake from being fun. It’s some of the best zombie blasting you’ll find. But this is an adaptation more than it is a franchise redefining expansion.It doesn’t help that the narrative is marred by a lack of returning actors. Resident Evil’s charm as a series rests both in the original camp presentation of the originals and the growing earnestness with which later games presented its pulp-action. Resident Evil 2 suffers from a lack of two figures: voice actors Matthew Mercer and Alyson Court, who portrayed Leon and Claire previously in the series. For reasons unclear, Resident Evil 2 opts for a new cast led by non-union actors and the result is that the narrative lacks charm. It doesn’t have the campiness of the original or even the self-serious earnestness of later games. Scenes move at a rapid pace, actors plowing through lines that might have been given far more weight and richness. The decision to go with a new cast harms Resident Evil 2 as a production, both ethically and in presentation. Scenes feel rushed and line delivery is too sedate. That understated nature sometimes translates to a budget-television feel that doesn’t even achieve the comfortable camp that initially defined the franchise. Instead, the new acting feels off-brand, like a college student’s reimagining of Resident Evil 2.Resident Evil 2 provides some of the best moments in the franchise. That can mean turning to flee as an unstoppable tyrant stomps closer and closer to you, using a flamethrower to dispose of a plant-infested zombie, or puzzling out where to place the Queen piece in a puzzle. The raw experience of playing Resident Evil 2 is visceral, bloody, and often incredibly rewarding. It stands side by side with some of the series’ best entries. It’s only in retrospect, after Raccoon City is in the rearview mirror, that questions begin to form. What was the game doing? What new things were built upon a familiar foundation? Did all the changes really work?For many fans, the answer to that last question will be an unequivocal yes, but the game can also feel uneven, moreso thanks to the changes made to modernize it. The new game certainly charges ahead more, but it’s lost something. The remake forces a somewhat ill-fitting gameplay frame onto environments and atmosphere that doesn’t always accommodate it well.  It exhibits  inspiring confidence as it presses forward without fear. But it’s that last part that gives me pause: without fear. It’s a fine game, an excellent horror experience, but also an inconsistent one. It  is neither a reinvention or a completely coherent celebration. It’s something trickier, if consistently captivating. It is pulse-pounding and a must play for horror fans, sometimes experimental but also superficial and rougher than expected."
USgamer,"I’m clutching my injured side and running for my life through Raccoon City Police Department’s west corridor. A zombie crashes through the window at the foot of the stairs ahead, and I can hear the claws of a licker clattering along the ceiling behind me, but it’s the stomps of the pursuing tyrant that have my heart pounding. Mr. X was sent here to smush my head. He’s unkillable, relentless, and he wears a narrow-brimmed hat like a deranged men’s rights activist.I make it to the safe room around the corner just in time, the door swinging shut behind me, and I turn in time to see the tyrant cheekily poke his head around the door as if he’s looking to flog me some car insurance. Soon after, I hear him stomping away.Mr. X hunts you incessantly whenever he’s around, but there are a few places where you can seek refuge. Like the xenomorph in Alien Isolation, he’s mostly unscripted and governed by set rules. This ruleset occasionally collides with other game systems to create funny, unexpected moments like the one above. You can also use his logic against him, drawing him to an area with gunfire before legging it to another wing of the station. Playing as Claire, you can get a silencer for your SMG that allows you to kneecap zombies in peace. 
 
The first few times you face him, panic takes over. The strange layout and tight corridors of the police station - a former museum - means that running without a purpose equals death. You have to constantly consult your map. Limited inventory capacity also forces you to make choices as to what key items to carry at any time, since they will be taking the space of ammo and healing items. Wherever you go, you have to go with purpose. You’re forced to pay attention.Because of this, you naturally learn the layout of this place as you play. Somehow, it only becomes more and more enjoyable as your mastery evolves. Resident Evil has always been about space. You’re in a hole and you can’t escape - you can only go deeper, into the parking garage, through the dog kennels, into the sewers, and finally, into the laboratory below. Even escaping the laboratory takes you deeper still, into the tunnels beneath the skin of the city. Along the way, you find shortcuts that loop back to earlier points and unlock new doors that increase your understanding, connecting those two locations like synapses firing in your brain. It’s intoxicating. 
 
My first playthrough takes me almost nine hours, not counting cutscenes, inventory management, and map consultation. By my fifth playthrough, I’ve cut my time down to just over two hours. I’ve made notes of all the puzzle solutions, allowing me to skip out getting the clues. I know which items to go for and which to leave. I know that avoiding the dead is often the best course of action, and I know that I should board up as many of those goddamn west corridor windows as I can.The thing is, the faster you try to play, the more mistakes you’re likely to make. It’s all fine and well running past zombies, but you’re going to have to navigate these rooms again later and with Mr. X dogging you. That aforementioned west corridor becomes a nightmare bottleneck if you don’t take the time to board up certain windows, and you have to return there at a few key points. Mess up and you’re stuck in a narrow walkway filled with lickers, zombies, and that unkillable bastard.Then there are the differences between playthroughs. Claire and Leon both have access to different areas of the station, as well as different enemy configurations. These alter slightly depending on which you play as first. One minute you might be fully stocked on ammo and ready to take on anything, and the next you’re limping along with a knife. There seems to be some kind of magic algorithm under the hood that works to keep you teetering on the edge of running out of ammo, so you often feel like you just scraped through. 
 
Even the way enemies behave keeps things exciting. Zombies move erratically, pacing past open doorways and teasing you with their rotten heads. When moving towards you, they sometimes change their gait, clawing at you in a burst of speed. The way their arms reach out to grab you can sometimes throw off your aim as well, the bullet tearing through their arm and causing the meat to fall off the bone like a slow cooked leg of lamb. Then there are the critical shots which occasionally see zombie heads explode in a single bullet, completely at random. The game is laced with things that can turn situations for and against you in a moment. That layer of unpredictability keeps things fresh through subsequent playthroughs.That gore system is also the best ever devised. Each shot takes a chunk out of an approaching zombie, and they can take a hell of a beating. What’s scarier than a normal zombie? A zombie with no fucking face, still trying to chomp at you with its exposed jaw and empty eye sockets, of course. This works together with a weighty physics system that sees downed zombies drop with a thud, or fall with their arms stuck between the bars of a jail cell. I killed one zombie in an office and it keeled over on a table. Moments later, it reanimated and began crawling along the table towards me. I shat it. Then there’s that zombie - I call him Peanut - who lost all his limbs and laid on the floor, staring and clicking his jaw in my direction. 
 
In all, I only really have one complaint, and it’s that I wish Leon and Claire would shut up. When aiming at an enemy, they have a set amount of voice lines where they react to the situation. Rather than sounding scared, they scream “fuck off” at zombies, and hurl other insults at the undead. At one point, Claire shouted “asshole” at a zombified dog. Still, it’s not enough to detract from a game this good.For my money, Resident Evil 2 Remake is right up there with Resident Evil 4 as the best game in the series. It’s the perfect blend of nostalgia and the new, marrying a classic game with contemporary game design, and a prime candidate for those Game of the Year lists. In January! Capcom clearly has no chill.Version tested: PlayStation 4.

Destructoid,"darkAfter the bombastic Resident Evil 6 nearly killed the franchise, we’re starting to see a resurgence of the series.While going back to the tried-and-true original with an HD remake is an almost guaranteed home run, Capcom also managed to follow up nostalgia with innovation in Resident Evil 7. The series is in a good spot is what I’m saying, and now the Resident Evil 2 remaster can join its ranks.Resident Evil 2 (PC, PS4 [reviewed], Xbox One)Developer: Capcom R&D Division 1Publisher: CapcomReleased: January 25, 2019MSRP: $59.99This isn’t just a touched-up re-release, it’s a full-on recreation of the original game. Some character models look completely beefed up (or in Mr. X’s case, morphed into a beefcake), a few sport interesting aesthetic changes, but nearly all of the alterations are for the better. Environmental touches like more dramatic lighting are standard fare, adding more urgency to some of the game’s myriad tense moments, but creepier enemy patterns are more nuanced. It’s all thanks to the decision to use the relatively recent Resident Evil 7‘s engine as a canvas.The entire setup is also ripe for revisiting. Leon, a green recruit of the Raccoon City police force, and the equally capable Claire are still quite the duo. There’s still some cheese, sure (I love seeing Leon yell “get off him” at a crazed lunatic who’s in the process of biting someone’s neck off), but it’s toned down a bit as Capcom severely pumped up the gore and horror factor, propped up by the updated sheen.The police station, much like the classic mansion in the original, also deserves a special mention as a character in and of itself. It manages to open up without getting too ridiculous (shotgunning wolves in an open tundra in Revelations was a bit much) and still present plenty of labyrinthine tunnels when it needs to. It’s creepier thanks to the engine change, and it most definitely benefits from Capcom’s decision to wait over 20 years to remaster it rather than the alternative: a stop-gap project a few generations ago.Not everything needed to be updated though. I still adore the built-in tension and overall philosophy of the Resident Evil series, which rewards prudence, thriftiness, and exploration. That latter bit is key as you’ll really need to take in your surroundings like a hawk. Did you remember that one hallway that has a door that needs bolt cutters to get through two hours after it’s relevant? I hope so, or you’ll be doing a lot of wandering, even with the semi-useful markings on the in-game map. Resident Evil has always awarded vigilance and this remaster continues that worthy legacy.While I don’t necessarily mind the fixed camera angles or tank controls of old, modern concessions that eliminate both ultimately help Resident Evil 2. Useless items are marked, so you can safely dispose of them. Multiple zombies can overpower you and knock you to the ground dynamically. The new engine is transformative: seeing a crawling zombie with no face (that you just shot off) is a spectacle.There are a few tradeoffs. Running animations are a little stiff, especially when juxtaposed to other elements of locomotion. Zombie grabs are a bit static and repetitive as well (they tend to always grab with pinpoint accuracy and hold on a little too long), even if they look visually impressive. There’s also a strangely low amount of zombie models present: to the point where you’ll see the same few faces every 10-15 minutes. You could chalk this up to the fact that they’re undying folk, but it does get a little silly witnessing the same exact dude shambling toward you after blowing another clone’s face off moments before.These are minor gripes: the world subsequently feels more alive and functionally impressive. This is mainly the same gist and location beats (which I won’t ruin here just in case, even if the game is two decades old), and the slight alterations to the story make for a better-paced, more horror-driven experience.While some may lament the removal of the “zapping” concept of the original, I don’t really miss it here. Now there are two clear cut-campaigns to tackle, which can either be played by Leon or Claire. Options are the name of the game, as you’ll unlock a “New Game [2nd Run]” with changes after the first completion (which took me roughly five and a half hours). There’s also another hardcore difficulty (ink ribbons required for saving, no autosaves, and enemies are stronger) and more extras in the form of 4th Survivor (a mini-scenario with Hunk and fixed items) and a Tofu jaunt.It’s interesting as you’re butting against the same exact linear pathway filled to the brim with enemies, but slowly learning and adapting the most optimal way to use items and dodge pratfalls (beat my time! It’s 10:39). After that, it’s onto the harder joke mode with Tofu on (basically) the same journey, just with knives-only. Between that and hardcore mode, stalwart fans of the original who are worried about the remaster being overly streamlined should be sated.My complaints about the Resident Evil 2 remaster are minimal. An argument could be made that Capcom could have done more, but the spirit of the original has been preserved and in many cases, enhanced. I hope every legacy game in the series gets this loving treatment, as I’ll probably be playing them for the rest of my life.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]SuperbA hallmark of excellence. There may be flaws, but they are negligible and won't cause massive damage.

I remember being nine-years-old and seeing Resident Evil 2 among the new releases at Wal-Mart. I don’t know exactly what drew me to it, as I had never played a horror game before. Something inside of me just knew I had to have it. That January day in 1998 I took a fresh copy of RE2 and the unofficial Prima guide — the one with the creepy Van Gogh looking zombie on the cover — home with me and entered the world of survival horror for the first time.Resident Evil 2 is one of my top games of all time. I played it during an especially tough time in my life. My father had just passed away, and I was emotionally raw. The game scared the bejeezus out of me. I had to hide the guide underneath a dresser because that damn zombie creeped me out so much, only pulling it out when I needed a crucial clue.But, even though RE2 gave me plenty of nightmares, it also helped me. The fear of zombies and Lickers enabled me to forget the much more immediate concern of life without my father. That’s the gift of horror games and movies. It’s a warped form of escapism that puts our real fears in perspective, and I’ll always love Resident Evil 2 for this reason.When I heard the news that there was finally going to be a Resident Evil 2 remake I was ecstatic. Over the years I’ve come to love the rest of the series, even the weaker entries, but RE2 is where it all began for me. Although I was somewhat nervous that somehow the magic of the original would be lost, reviewing this reimagining of Resident Evil 2 has been an absolute pleasure, and this game marks a real return to the series roots.The premise of RE2R is the same as the first. Leon Kennedy is the latest addition to the Raccoon City Police Department. Even after being warned by his superiors to steer clear of his first assignment, he drives into Raccoon City to see if he can make a difference. He crosses paths with Claire Redfield, college student and motorcycle enthusiast, who is looking for her brother and one of the main characters of RE1, Chris Redfield.The two wind up in Raccoon City surrounded by zombies and other horrors created as a result of the nefarious actions of the Umbrella Corporation. Along the way, Leon meets Ada Wong, a woman who claims to be an FBI agent investigating Umbrella, and Claire meets Sherry, a little girl who has somehow survived the horror, but who is more connected to its origin than anyone would guess.The path our two heroes take through the Resident Evil 2 remake is significantly different from that in the original, but the story hits many of the same points in one form or another. The most important fact for fans of the original is that nothing has been removed. All the characters you know are here, and many of their roles have expanded.But the Resident Evil 2 remake isn’t just a remaster with added content. It would be easy to get that image in your head since that’s how Capcom handled the remake of the original Resident Evil in 2002. Instead, this is a from-the-ground-up reimagining. Every single bit of the original has been changed in one way or another.There’s plenty of familiar territory in Resident Evil 2 remake, no doubt, but by necessity, no location in the game retains the exact same look as its original counterpart. Some purists might think this is a bad thing, but there was no other way to make this game. The original used pre-rendered backgrounds and fixed camera angles, so whole swaths of locations were just never in view. It’s weird to think of just how much of the RPD, Sewers, and Labs we didn’t see in the original, and how much was filled in with our imagination.Because of the limited view of the original’s fixed cameras pretty much the whole game had to be redesigned to some extent. All those places that were out of sight before now needed to have just as much attention paid to them as the ones that were out in the open due to the decision to use a third-person, freely-rotating camera. As a result, even the areas that closely follow the design of the original game feel new.The higher fidelity imagery also adds a lot of details that we never got to see in the original. A lot of areas in the original allowed you to examine them to get flavor text like, “The desk is disorganized and untidy. It probably reflects the owner’s personality.” Now, though, you get to see that type of thing instead of just reading commentary on it by the characters. The whole game is peppered with little details that make it feel more real. For example, the RPD’s walls are decked in missing person posters, departmental awards, cork boards with memos, and it just adds to the illusion of being in a besieged police station.Although many areas are similar to their counterparts from the original game, there are a massive amount of additions, tweaks, and twists that come with Resident Evil 2 remake. Some locations have been moved, items may do things they didn’t do in the original, or be used in different ways. Puzzles are also all-new, so even if you find yourself in a familiar situation, you’ll see that knowledge of the first game doesn’t always translate into knowing what to do in the remake.The remake expands each location in the original game considerably. The RPD gets a whole third level added to it, a more extensive basement, and more. The sewers are now more than just a brief stopover and are a key location in their own right. You’ll also get to see more of the streets of Raccoon City than you did in the original game. Besides familiar areas, there are also entirely new locations that have been added that you’ll visit during your journey.There are a few places that have been removed, though you probably won’t even miss them the first time through the game. I don’t want to drop spoilers and ruin anyone’s exploration experience, so I won’t name what these areas are. I will say that the geography makes more sense with one of them gone, and at least one section of another canon Resident Evil game now makes a hell of a lot more sense.The most important thing about the new environmental design is that I didn’t feel like I was missing anything from the original after I was done with Resident Evil 2 remake. The locations Resident Evil 2 takes place in are as much a part of the cast as Ada, Sherry, or Annette, and I feared that something significant would be cut or changed in a way that would negatively impact the game. Surprisingly, Capcom somehow managed to translate the game into a fully 3D world without leaving anything important out.We haven’t seen classic zombies in Resident Evil since before Resident Evil 4 debuted, so I was really wondering how they’d pull them off. In the third-person RE games, we’ve always had zombies that for one reason or another retained enough intelligence to allow them to use weapons or work as a group. I genuinely wondered if they could implement those classic, dumb zombies in 3D without making them feel toothless. After all, a big part of what made them so threatening in the original game was the fixed camera angles and tank controls.I’m glad to report that RE2R‘s zombies are even more threatening than the ones in the original. For one, they’re tougher. They can take a whole handgun magazine in the chest, and you might make them fall over, but they’ll be coming back for more.Because zombies soak up ammo, you have to be more strategic when combating them. A lone zombie in an area can be a major block to your advancement. They hit harder than in the original, but you also have more choice on how to deal with them. You can lure them out of an area and run past them. If you can’t do that, you can handicap them by blasting off one of their legs, since with this game zombies are fully dismemberable. Of course, if you’re feeling your inner Dirty Harry, you can also fell them with one melon-splitting magnum headshot.What adds even more to the feeling of horror that zombies, and other enemies, bring is the gore system in Resident Evil 2 remake. Each gunshot, explosion, or knife swipe takes out a big chunk of your enemy wherever it hits. Blast a zombie in the face with a shotgun, and you might be rewarded brain matter flying everywhere, or if you’re unlucky you might just have peeled off the meat and now have a grinning skull lunging toward your throat.One place that RE2R really improves on RE7 is the enemy variety. Besides a few minor enemies, all the monsters from the original return, albeit some in different forms. While some are just a graphical improvement over their original versions, they all have new weak spots and behaviors that take advantage of the new 3D gameplay. Lickers, for example, are blind and hunt based on hearing. This was a facet in the original, but given their improved lethality in the remake, stealthing past these long-tongued monsters is a smart tactic.I just got done talking about enemies, but there’s one in particular that stood out as an absolute menace. Tyrant T-103, a.k.a. Mr. X returns in the Resident Evil 2 remake as an even more intimidating enemy. In the original game, he’d appear during each character’s B scenario and was imposing there. However, he was also predictable. After getting over the shock of him bursting through a wall or slowly walking down the corridor at you, it wasn’t hard to realize that if you just go through a door, then he’d leave you alone until the next time you triggered him to pop out.I rarely feel any panic in games. After all, how often is there actually something actively fighting against you in games? In the majority of games the AI just reacts to you entering an area, you kill or slip past them, and that’s the end of it. In Resident Evil 2 remake Mr. X is no joke. Mr. X doesn’t care about all that passive mess. He wants to kill you, and he is going to follow you until he does it.The first time I met him, I was genuinely panicked. I knew where I had to go, but that relentless thudding as you hear him closing in on you makes it hard to think. The RPD forms many loops, so you do have a chance to evade him, but it’s easy to get pushed into a bad situation. You may have to slip into a corridor with a Licker or several zombies and try your luck with some enemies you can snake past or takedown.While he may be relentless, you can outpace Mr. X. He’s sensitive to sound, so if you avoid firing your gun, step lightly, and don’t slam through doors, it’ll take longer for him to track you. For me, this was somehow worse than him just thundering after me. Sneaking down the desolate corridors, filled with the creaking of wooden boards punctuated by the moans of the undead all the while listening to his footsteps getting closer, then further, then closer is nerve-wracking. This is survival horror, this is what Resident Evil is all about, and RE2R captures it spectacularly.The good part, though, is that Mr. X doesn’t overstay his welcome. The parts where he chases you are thrilling without becoming unfair and frustrating.The transition to 3D could have been a bad one for Resident Evil 2. The original game gives the illusion of 3D, but really all the action takes place on one plane, with some limited interaction above and below the player. The thing that made the gunplay difficult and exciting in the original was the awkward controls, obscured vision, and spongey enemies.All the controls and combat of the original RE2 had to be thrown out the window for the remake. The transition to the third-person camera makes things a lot more complicated. The perspective is now over-the-shoulder and plays more like RE4, 5, and 6 than it does RE2. However, don’t let that fool you into thinking RE2R is an action game.The devs have taken a system that could have led to a more traditional third-person shooter feel and tweaked it to retain the horror feel. The most crucial step they took was when it comes to aiming your weapon. RE2R requires a bit more time than your standard third-person shooter for your character to take aim. If you aim and immediately fire, the spread will be so wide you likely won’t hit anything, even if it’s right in front of you.Instead, each weapon has its own quirks when it comes to aiming right. If you don’t want to waste your very limited supply of bullets you need to stand your ground and take your time between each shot. As you play the game more, you’ll start to get down the nuances of each gun, and you’ll start getting the muscle memory down to fire right at the moment when your character has steadied themselves.All but one of the weapons from the original game return in RE2R, and you can find upgrade parts for each throughout the game to enhance their abilities. You may be upset to hear that one weapon was cut, but I assure you, it sucked, and no one liked it. To make up for it, the Spark Shot and Flamethrower are actually useful this time around, and I found that every weapon for both Claire and Leon had its utility.RE2R manages to introduce an entirely new method of control and gunplay while still retaining the overall feel of the original. This is an area that was really make-or-break for the spirit of the game, and I’m impressed that Capcom was able to pull it off.To complete both Leon and Claire’s scenarios the first time took me around 11 hours. I already knew the general layout of the RPD, minus the additions, from the original game and the demo, and went through at a relatively brisk pace. Contrary to early reports, however, A/B scenarios are still in the game. This time around they’re called 1st and 2nd runs, and the differences between them are a bit more negligible than in the original. However, I still found it fun to take each character through both of their scenarios.Besides the 1st and 2nd run scenarios, there’s a host of other unlockables available as well. The “Records” section gives you a checklist of tasks to complete, for which you’ll be rewarded with models for the model viewer, concept art, weapons, costumes, and even other modes. Hunk returns in a revamped 4th Survivor mode and you can still unlock Tofu in The Tofu Survivor as well.You get a rank at the end of each campaign run-through as well. So, there’s a lot of fun to be had in trying to beat your times. It’s evident that the developers kept speedrunners in mind when designing the game, and one of the things I like about the new location designs is that there are a ton of optional areas that you don’t even have to visit to beat the game.So, if you choose to take the scenic route, there’s plenty of places to visit and items to obtain that can help you in your journey. Alternatively, if you’re looking to make a record time you can skip these non-essential locations at the expense of perhaps not getting a weapon upgrade, or having to make do with less healing items or ammo.While I was reviewing the game, I managed to get an S rank, but I’m confident there are more efficient paths to take than I did. I can’t wait to see people start speedrunning this game and see just how minimalistic you can get with a run.I also got the good fortune to play with the retro soundtrack, and man, if you’re a fan of the original, it’s definitely worth a whole playthrough just to experience this DLC. I’m generally not one to emphasize any purchases beyond the base game, but the retro soundtrack is just nostalgia city, and still manages to blend well with the new gameplay and locations.The Resident Evil 2 remake has brought the series back to where it needs to be. This game captures the spirit of the original trilogy perfectly while also bringing to bear all the good things that came out of the later entries in the series. As a fan of the original RE2, I was blown away by how much love was poured into this remake, and I hope it’s a sign of things to come for the future of Resident Evil.Whether you’re a long time fan or a newcomer, Resident Evil 2 remake is an absolutely fantastic game. It’s the best in the series yet and wholly outshined my most optimistic expectations. It doesn’t supersede the original, but it’s an excellent retelling, a wonderful update, and an excellent experience.Buy Resident Evil 2 Now!Resident Evil 2 reviewed on PS4.

Login NowThis slick, action-packed remake of the survival horror classic is Capcom at its finest, but is it worth making a trip back to the zombie-ridden R.P.D.? Our review. For the most part, you should never remake a classic. It’s been gotten wrong too many times in the past to count, whether we’re talking movies, songs, video games, or other forms of media. There’s a reason why it’s a classic, after all – and messing with what made it that way in the first place is often a bad idea.However, Capcom has proven in the past with 2002’s GameCube Resident Evil remake that, under the right circumstances, the new product could possibly surpass the original. It’s not often this happens, and it’s hardly ever fair that the new version could ever replace what came before it, but it can get pretty damn close. That’s the case with Resident Evil 2, Capcom’s latest stab at revitalizing the long-running survival horror series. Instead of taking the existing game and slapping a fresh coat of paint on it for a quick buck, Capcom took its time to create something new, different, and sublime while aiming to preserve the greatness of the past.Resident Evil 2 is one of the best games the series has ever seen, and should be held in as high regard as the original PlayStation classic, in fact. Here’s why.The game has been transformed entirely from the ground up, though it still retains important narrative cues from the original. Leon S. Kennedy is on the way to his first shift as a member of the Raccoon City police force, but upon arriving at the R.P.D., he very quickly realizes that something's amiss. On the flip side, college student Claire Redfield is searching for her S.T.A.R.S operative brother Chris Redfield. Upon meeting in Raccoon City, the two attempt to team up, to combat the zombie threat, but are immediately divided, setting the stage for the dual campaign you can play through one after the other.This full-on reboot has shifted from fixed camera angles and tank controls to a polished, more fluid action game that's smooth like butter. Leon and Claire move slowly and methodically through labyrinthine, nearly claustrophobic environments, with some of the best handling the series has seen since Resident Evil 7. The action-oriented over-the-shoulder play is tweaked to perfection here, swapping in third-person shooter methodology that instills gut-wrenching horror in every step you take.The atmosphere is unbelievable, as is the tension that permeates every inch of the game. This is Resident Evil, distilled to its finest form, and you’ll want to drink every single bit of it up. It’s lush, it’s visceral, it’s morbid. It’s the culmination of what the series always has been and could be, and then some.With the darkness washing over everything and your flashlight acting as the only beacon in a world rife with bloodthirsty zombies, you feel the chill of this new vision of Resident Evil right away. Moans and blood-curdling shrieks can cut through the silence at any moment. One wrong move, and the deteriorating corpse at your feet may spring up to greet you. You can unload an entire clip in it, sure, but it may still keep coming for you.That’s why it’s such a boon that you can now blow limbs off to cleave through a zombie’s leg or ankle and slow them down, or give them a shotgun blast to the face that, for the first time in recent Resident Evil history, actually looks like you hit them at close-range with a powerful weapon. We’re not talking chunks flying everywhere, but believable model destruction that could very well give you nightmares if you’re not used to sinewy-faced shamblers reaching out for you in the dark. It’s a beautiful thing, seeing a horror franchise embrace everything that makes it terrifying in the first place, and this was one of the game’s biggest highlights for me.Yes, the zombies' gore factor this time around has been ratcheted up to 100, and the game features, quite frankly, the best blood, entrails, and disfigured corpses I've ever seen in a game, even from those that purport to be ""horrific"" and ""disturbing."" It’s fun to just sit back and pump the zombies full of lead to see what you can do to them as they’re lying there because it’s so ridiculously detailed. There are also encounters, such as with the always painful-looking William Birkin, that really drive home how much work was put into making every inch of this game look as detailed as possible. Mmm, guts.Of course, we can't forget about the Tyrant, also lovingly referred to as Mr X. The persistent boss character's threatening presence, stature, and demeanor are even creepier than the first time we made his acquaintance, and actively attempting to avoid him is nerve-wracking in the best possible way. Somehow, he's even more imposing than ever before. Perhaps it's that hat, or that slow, sure gait. He knows he can crush you like a tin can, and he wants to. Whatever it is, it's a signal to get your butt moving and get gone before you're pulverized.Thankfully, his appearances aren’t random, and he isn’t a consistent threat throughout the entire game, but when he’s out and about, you need to hightail it out of there to somewhere he’s not, unless you want to lose quite a bit of game progress. He’s always been one of the most intriguing parts of Resident Evil 2 by far, and the terror he strikes in the hearts of players is only magnified here. He adds an incredible amount of tension to the game, which makes it even more of a pleasure to play through.Most of the threats you’ll face are zombies and other variations thereof, of course. Some classic enemies are nowhere to be found, however, such as spiders and crows, which may bug series purists. In their stead are a spread of interesting new enemies that'll have you shaking, though, so it's no huge loss. It's still something to keep in mind if you're looking for those big fuzzy arachnids and wondering how nasty they look in HD.For those looking for more cerebral action, fear not – it's not been turned into a third-person shooter by any means, though you'll have your fair share of zombie slaying to deal with. There's a wide variety of puzzles to contend with, some similar in scope to the original Resident Evil 2's, and a selection of others that are completely new. You won't be able to rely on old solutions (or old guides) here, and may find yourself stumbling until you figure things out, but that's part of the fun. Being forced to figure out which key goes where and if item X needs to be used for area Y has always been an integral part of the series, and that's still here in full force.Just because you’ve finished one campaign, that doesn’t mean you’re completely finished. It doesn’t matter who you start with. Go back and do it again with the other character for your next playthrough, otherwise you’re not even done. Both Leon and Claire's campaigns feature a wealth of completely different scenarios that are integral to experiencing the whole of Resident Evil 2. While you’ll explore a modicum of the same areas and complete similar objectives, a good stretch of each campaign is totally different. For instance, there are entire blocks of time you'll spend with or as different characters, such as Ada Wong with Leon and Sherry Birkin with Claire.Ada is on her way to catch up with the enigmatic Annette Birkin during her portion of Leon’s campaign, utilizing her EMF visualizer and pistol to get past the obstacles in her way. She can hold her own, of course, but you’ll have to be smart about when and where to use the EMF tool so you can progress to the next area. Sherry is a stealth-oriented character, with no way to defend herself beyond flitting behind cabinets and desks to avoid being slaughtered by Chief Irons. You’ll only switch off to these “partner” characters with extended one-time scenarios, so it’s not a tag-team affair. Originally, you took control of both characters a few times, so the campaigns have been condensed a bit to streamline the switch-offs. While Ada’s action-packed segments are entertaining of course, it’s Sherry’s section that really caught my attention, as it takes place in an entirely new area: the orphanage. Police chief Brian Irons is after the young girl, and he’s up to no good, for reasons I can’t spoil here. He takes Sherry to the orphanage, where she’s dead set on getting out and getting back to Claire.There are a variety of disturbing sights and sounds found there, too. In one area, he has Raccoon City’s Mayor Warren’s daughter spread out on a table with the intent to stuff her, calling back to his profession as a taxidermist in the past. The scene has chilling implications as you wonder what Irons was up to before the young girl was tied to the table. Sherry has to hide from Irons in a section not unlike something you’d see in games like Outlast, where you’re being chased by an unbeatable enemy that’ll send you hurtling toward an instant Game Over if you’re spotted. It was an excellent stealth section that really communicated what a piece of work Irons was, and elevated Sherry’s character for me, personally.You’ll also come across quite a few surprises in terms of boss encounters and scenes that definitely weren’t in the original game that I won’t spoil here, but suffice it to say, you’ll be left with your jaw hanging open. Unfortunately, the game doesn’t take the opportunity to flesh out or expand on some of the more ambiguous parts of the Resident Evil lore, which I would have liked to see, but given that it does deliver with new content all its own, that’s not a huge issue.Beyond its main components, everything about Resident Evil 2 is an absolute joy. From the updated character models to the voice acting and everything in between, you can tell this was indeed a labor of love pieced together painstakingly in a way that Capcom knew would appeal to even the most hardcore fans.It's a small touch, but I appreciated the fact that both Leon and Claire would occasionally utter phrases like ""Oh, what the f*ck?"" and other incredulous exclamations while traipsing around areas positively riddled with zombies. It’s not often you hear these organic sound bytes in games, as most protagonists wade calmly through hordes of monsters and enemies, usually stopping to comment on the situation when they receive a call or something like that. Leon and Claire love to talk about what’s going on around them, unprompted, which will always get a giggle (or equally horrified line) out of you.Then there’s the extra content aside from the game. When you finish the game, you'll unlock The 4th Survivor, a brief side story featuring series mainstay Hunk. Complete this mission and you'll be rewarded with the Tofu Survivor mode, which lets you take on The 4th Survivor once more as the adorable, gelatinous blob of bean curd. There are other surprises that come out of Tofu Survivor, but you'll have to play to find out what they are.Beyond conquering both Leon and Claire's paths and improving your rank with each run-through, there's a series of fun in-game ""achievements"" you can unlock that grant concept art, character models, and other goodies. There’s a series of Weekly Challenges that are set to come to the game soon, but I couldn’t access them during my review period as they weren’t yet available. Selecting the option went to the Resident Evil website, as the option was linked to an address that obviously wasn’t live at the time. It’ll be interesting to see what these bring to the table and what sort of rewards they offer as well.For those wondering, there are no microtransactions whatsoever, nothing you have to pay extra to enjoy, and nothing you can’t unlock with a little bit of effort. Leon and Claire’s campaigns can be completed in about 7 to 10 hours total, but you can get through them both a lot quicker than that. For my S-rank playthrough of Leon’s campaign, it only took under four hours, and you can shave plenty of time off from there.Don't labor under the delusion that, if you played the original Resident Evil 2, that you should skip this one for some reason. There’s no excuse of “I’ve already played the original, so I don’t need to grab this one.” You couldn’t be more wrong if that’s your line of thinking. From top to bottom, this is already an early contender for Game of the Year 2019, and one of the greatest reasons ever to be a survival horror fan. This incarnation of Resident Evil is nearly like playing a wholly different game, and in fact stands on its own as an excellent analogue to one of the greatest survival horror games of all time. Whether you're a Resident Evil fan or you're looking to delve into the terrifying world of horror gaming, you owe it to yourself to make this iteration of Resident Evil a day one purchase.This review is based on a PlayStation 4 code provided by the game’s publisher. Resident Evil 2 will be available for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on January 25, 2019.Fueled by horror, rainbow-sugar-pixel-rushes, and video games, Brittany is a Senior Editor at Shacknews who thrives on surrealism and ultraviolence.

					The first 2 RE games weren't particularly long. I figured it wouldn't be like RE4. :(				
					I mentioned this in the review, but you get The 4th Survivor after completing the game and then Tofu Survivor after finishing that. Obviously you finish Leon or Claire first and get their A/B scenarios after that, but no New Game+ in a technical sense. There is a new DLC package coming at some point (I covered today on Shacknews) which appears to be adding a randomizer for free, so that's good news. There will also be weekly challenges, but we don't know what they'll entail yet.

Two years ago, Capcom struck surprising gold with its umpteenth Resident Evil video game. 2017's Resident Evil 7 was the spark the aging series needed, particularly after RE5 and RE6 threw out the series' best ideas, and it proved that Capcom still knew how to deliver familiar chills without making things boring.The game's success put Capcom in an odd conundrum. How the heck does it follow such a quality surprise? The answer is an apparent stopgap: Resident Evil 2, a deliberate remake of the 1998 classic Playstation hit.The result is honestly everything you might want from a triple-A game launching in the slow month of January. RE2 is a modern Resident Evil game: behind-the-shoulder action, smooth controls, gorgeous visuals, masterfully staged atmosphere, ridiculous entrails, and true surprises. RE2 is also a classic Resident Evil game: cheesy dialogue, tight corridors, police-station environs, lumbering zombies, and simple puzzles that rely on item fetching and backtracking.Authenticity isn't the issue, then, but rather how much of that authenticity you can stomach two decades later. Does a popcorn-muncher of a horror film sequel sound fun, in which you accept yet another return to summer camp or the creepy suburbs in exchange for new twists on familiar scares? RE2 does the same thing for video games by marrying memorable moments, tried-and-tiring mechanics, and a return trip to the Raccoon City Police Department.The zombies are back. It's Umbrella Corporation's fault. Two easily startled young people—one rookie cop and one veteran cop's sister—are running straight into the heart of the chaos to learn more, for reasons. This curiosity gets them stuck in a monster-infested police station full of weapons, ammo, puzzles, and healing herbs.That setup should sound painfully familiar to series fans, but it's not a note-for-note retread. RE2's twists and divergences from the 1998 source material are welcome, including brand-new dialogue and voice acting, though it's worth noting that the result isn't a character-driven drama on par with RE7's creepy family. Still, the most important shift from the 1998 game comes from the police station itself. Here, Capcom either reimagines the original game's most familiar scenes or invents entirely new ones, to creepy effect.Part of that boils down to the incredible tech on display, fueled by Capcom's proprietary RE Engine. Where that engine was optimized in RE7 for comfortable, fluid visuals in a VR headset, RE2 cranks its atmospheric effects into overdrive. Realistically baked lights, dazzling water effects (whether dripping as shiny particles of rain or gushing as a flood in a creepy room), judicious use of particle-loaded clouds of smoke and fog, and stretchy, gooey effects on bullet-ravaged zombies: we're teetering on the edge of what current-gen consoles can muster, and RE2 should already enjoy a cozy spot in a year-end, ""best graphics of 2019"" list.You'll still get a helluva looker on any standard or ""pro"" console this generation, but all console versions ship without getting near 60fps. This isn't a twitchy shooter by any stretch, so you'll get by, but Capcom deserves a ton of credit for letting PC players easily tweak their way to 60fps without sacrificing the RE Engine's most atmospheric stuff.You'll be forgiven for expecting something twitchier, thanks to the game's shift in perspective. Whereas RE2 originally shipped on PS1 with pre-rendered ""cinematic"" camera angles, this year's model hangs the camera behind players' shoulders.This camera perspective was first popularized in Resident Evil 4, but that game opted for open, gray-sky environs between its cabins and underground scenes. Capcom has finally married this action-oriented perspective with the tighter, creepier corridors of the series' first era. You might expect a nightmare of unoptimized cameras, like in PS1 games that constantly rejigger the view to random behind-the-back points, but Capcom makes these worries melt away with nimble camera management. That's helped by a solid control suite, tuned for fast turns and quick, smooth aiming.As a result, RE2 never intentionally hamstrings your ability to easily look at or run through its most claustrophobic moments. This game delivers a front-row seat to some of the creepiest vistas ever in a game, and it makes players feel like they're in control of a ""cinematic"" view, instead of forcing pre-rendered angles.Yet all of that positive stuff is still draped over familiar '90s adventure tropes. RE2 leads players through a sprawling, multi-path police estate, but the gameplay is ultimately quite linear. Every sequence can be described as follows: go to the one or two open paths available at a given moment. Find a new barrier and a new ""key item."" Go back to a previously blocked zone and use that key item to open a path or get a new item. Use what you've found to go back to the last barrier you discovered. Fear for your virtual life in the process. And repeat.Conveniently, when you return in back-tracking fashion to a room you've been to before, perhaps to unlock a safe or solve a puzzle, a new door, window, or vent will usually have opened. This ensures that you will at least face the fear of encountering some new, terrible zombie scourge, even if one doesn't appear. (One probably will appear. Or three.)This backtracking is made as tedious as ever by inventory management. Players can only carry eight distinct items at a time to start, and each slot can be hogged by a single weapon, a single herb, a key item, a giant stack of ammo, etc. It doesn't take long to add a few more slots, and on ""normal"" difficulty, this excludes the ""typewriter ink"" needed to save your game. (Ink only factors in if you pick ""hard"" difficulty.)But it's still a thing to deal with, clearly intended to make players feel weak and hobbled when they're forced to leave health or ammo supplies behind. But many of the game's stretches come with an abundance of items and a lack of zombie interruptions once a wave of baddies is cleared. Thus, an average player can expect to go through a major path, pick up key items, run back to a storage locker, dump certain items, go back to their previous path, grab the rest of the items, return again to a storage locker, dump more items, shuffle inventory, and head to the next objective.Is that better than having any return to a ""cleared"" zone be artificially altered by magically generating zombies? Not necessarily. But while some of the game's backtracking cleverly forces players to deal with surprises, much of it doesn't. That is a glaring miss in a game full of mostly solid center-mass hits.Did I mention the sound design? Goodness, the sound design. A quarter of the ambient sounds are tried-and-true horror game staples—creaking floorboards, growling zombies, wild rainstorms—but the majority of the soundscape is filled with diabolically weird stuff. Ambient synthesizer tones, frequency tricks, inexplicable mechanical whirls, distorted heavy breathing: this game's audio universe is pretty close to peerless.And then there's the matter of the game gleefully owning its predictability. Take a sequence in which players must retrieve a variety of mechanical parts to open a door. One path, to a ""generator room,"" is marked on the map, and to get to it, you have to go through a ""kennel room."" As in, the home of the crazed zombie dogs you just met before finding that map. Sure enough, you have to tiptoe past a row of conveniently locked cages, full of psychotic zombie mutts.Get to the generator room, and you'll find what you need—but the act of finding it loudly unlocks a door. Amid a ringing alarm, you realize you're trapped in a dead-end, where the only way out is back through the kennel room. Whose cages have all just unlocked.Beep, beep, beep.Bark, bark, bark.Crap, crap, CRAP.The panicked run that follows, sung to the tune of ""there are way more dogs and zombies than there are bullets in my gun,"" is one of the game's many pitch-perfect moments of terror, the kind that horror buffs will drool over no matter what tedium it takes to reach them. And those fans will need to really savor RE2's highs, because they're met with a good number of been-there-done-that lows.Backtracking, fetch quests, and serviceable boss fights see Capcom leaving much of the game in the ""just good enough"" pile (and, honestly, padding each runthrough's 12-hour time estimate). RE2 is by no means a modern reinvention of the horror wheel, unlike the jaw-dropping success of RE7 or the creeping-dread experimentation of Konami's P.T.Instead, it's as good of a stopgap horror game as we're likely to see for some time. Capcom has made the welcome decision of marrying existing plot, concept, and mechanics with an abundance of polish—and not overselling the results. If that sounds good enough to you, prepare to enjoy RE2's equal mix of comfort and spine-tingling discomfort.Verdict: The modern-aesthetic upgrade more than makes up for the game's lowest lows. Horror fans should immediately buy.Listing image by CapcomJoin the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox. Sign me up →
