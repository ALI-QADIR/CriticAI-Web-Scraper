Link Official siteResident Evil Village begins with a scene of domestic bliss, as our hero Ethan Winters (returning from Resident Evil 7) and his wife Mia prepare dinner and look after their newborn baby, Rosemary. Then something bad happens—I won't say what, because it's pretty shocking—and soon Ethan finds himself lost in an isolated village in a snowstorm, searching for his kidnapped child. It's a sharp, sudden intro, but an effective one, immediately setting the stakes high and establishing Village's brutal, sadistic tone.It's never explicitly stated where the village the game takes its name from is located, but a few clues point towards it being nestled somewhere in the wintry mountains of Romania. The village itself is a scrappy, ramshackle scattering of wood and brick houses, farmer's fields, and the occasional church. Over it looms a gothic castle with immense spires stretching into the mist, and there are also traces of ancient ruins, suggesting a long and strange history. It's a magnificent setting, dripping with atmosphere, menace, and mystery—and a place I wanted to explore every dark, dingy corner of.Ethan is a boring guy who always seems confused about what's going on, and never has anything interesting to say. This makes him a slightly unremarkable protagonist, but his extreme normality does heighten the eccentricity of the village's many oddball residents. The previous game's Baker family were a relatively grounded bunch of ghouls, but here Capcom has seriously ramped up the monstrousness of its antagonists. As Ethan hunts for Rose, he goes up against an impossibly tall and glamorous vampire, a weird mutant fish-man, a killer porcelain doll, and other assorted weirdos.What I love about Village is that it never settles on being just one kind of horror game. Each villain's lair features a very different take on the genre, from breathless, action-packed survival against hordes of enemies, to a more slow-burning, psychological brand of horror. It's a game overflowing with cool, memorable ideas, constantly inventing clever, surprising new ways to raise your heart rate and jolt you out of your comfort zone. And it manages to keep this up for pretty much the entire duration of the game.What I love about Village is that it never settles on being just one kind of horror gameEach section is so wildly different, Village almost has the feel of a horror anthology. Admittedly, this can make it feel inconsistent at times, as if all the parts are flimsily strung together. You often get the sense that Capcom had the ideas for the game's many brilliant set-pieces first, then decided how to connect them all together at the last minute. But it's worth it for the variety this approach offers. You genuinely never know what fresh weirdness the developer is going to throw at you next.This not only makes this the most varied Resident Evil to date, but arguably the scariest. One of the best examples of this is the mansion of Donna Beneviento, a dollmaker and one of the village's rulers. In her creaking, dusty old house—which is littered with dozens of eerie, black-eyed dolls in various states of disrepair—you're forced through a series of brilliantly constructed moments of understated, excruciatingly tense horror, culminating in an encounter that might well be the scariest single moment in Resident Evil history.In another section you're hunted by Lady Dimitrescu, the aforementioned lofty vampire. Her 15th Century castle is an opulent labyrinth of ornate, gilded corridors and shadowy drawing rooms, lavishly decorated and softly lit by candles. It's an incredibly atmospheric setting, and the imposing Lady D bearing down on you (crouching to squeeze through doorways that are much too small for her) is thrillingly nerve-wracking. As she pursues, you have to hunt for objects to unlock the main gate, which involves some light puzzling and, in true Resi style, mentally mapping the building.Castle Dimitrescu is perhaps the best showcase of Resident Evil's impressive visuals—but the entire game is just obscenely pretty. The environments are richly detailed and stunningly lit, with a tangible layer of grime and texture to every object and surface. It runs smoothly, even at high resolutions, and raytracing makes for some gorgeous lighting and reflections. The character models are also spectacular, with expressive, convincing animation bringing the cast horribly to life. The English voice acting is a little hammy, but for the most part this suits these absurd, egomaniacal characters.The castle and dollmaker's mansion are among the series' most memorable set-pieces. But I do wish they had squeezed more out of some of them. In one sense, I do appreciate how Capcom resists the urge to milk its ideas dry, enthusiastically tossing them aside to present something new to the player. This keeps things feeling fresh and unpredictable throughout. But occasionally I'd reach the end of one of these sequences and think ""Is that it?"" Sometimes I just wish the game would give me more time to soak it all in before shoving me through to the next room of the haunted house.Elsewhere, the horror is more immediate. While Resident Evil 7 had one type of regular enemy—the sludge-like Molded—Village features an array of savage horrors called Lycans. These feral, snarling creatures come in various forms, and you have to regularly switch up your tactics to fight them. The standard grunt Lycan isn't overly powerful, but they're agile and athletic, able to leap at you suddenly from a distance and clamber up walls and ladders, which makes for some entertainingly dramatic, fast-paced battles.I found the regular Lycans too cartoonishly werewolf-like to really be scared by them, but later iterations are much more intimidating. There are some really messed up creatures in the latter half of Village, including twitching biomechanical horrors with drills for arms, guys with chunks of rusty metal screwed to them as makeshift armour, and other similarly grim examples of Clive Barker-esque body horror. It makes those sentient blobs of black slime from RE7 seem very lame in comparison.There are some really messed up creatures in the latter half of VillageWhile much of Village takes place in tight, narrow spaces, it sometimes opens up into larger arenas built with combat in mind. Here you'll find explosive barrels to lure groups of enemies towards, roofs to climb, houses to slip into, and furniture to drag across doorways to stem the flow of Lycans. These sections are enjoyably frantic, but are less interesting than the moments when you don't have to fire your weapon much, or at all. Village is a decent first-person shooter, but whenever Capcom focuses on atmosphere and tension over action, it's a better game.However, the developer seems to have almost entirely lost interest in puzzles. There are a few in Village, but they're extremely easy, with solutions that are always staring you right in the face. As someone who has always enjoyed the arcane, convoluted puzzles in Resident Evil games, I find this slightly disappointing. It does make for a pacier game, with fewer interruptions to the flow of exploration and combat. But I like those interruptions, and I feel like Village could have benefited from being a little more cerebrally taxing. I didn't get stuck once in the 11 hours it took me to finish it.Ethan has very few allies in the village, and they tend to die horribly not long after meeting him. But a mysterious character known as The Duke is a constant friendly presence. He's a merchant with a curiously enigmatic personality, and always seems to be one step ahead of you. Turn a corner in a new area and you'll find him there, quietly puffing on a cigar, eagerly awaiting your coin. He sells weapons, ammo, crafting blueprints, and other helpful stuff, and will buy any treasure you happen to pick up—including the crystalised remains of bosses, which always fetch a tidy price.The Duke can also upgrade weapons and turn raw ingredients into meals that permanently increase your health, defence, and movement speed. As you explore the village you'll encounter a range of wildlife including pigs, sheep, chickens, and the occasional fish splashing around in a stream. Shoot them and they'll drop meat, which The Duke can then use to whip up one of these tasty stat-boosting feasts. This is one of several optional quests and distractions, which help Village feel slightly less linear than the last game, even if the story does follow a strictly prescribed path.Running into The Duke gives me the same feeling of relief I get when I find a safe room in the old Resident Evil games. It's a chance to breathe, regroup, tidy up your cluttered inventory, and save at the nearby typewriter. Yes, typewriters are back, but you don't need ink ribbons to use them. Inventory management is an important consideration in Village, but limited to weapons, ammunition, and health items. There are no magic item boxes in this game, so if a weapon or some other bulky object is taking up too much space, you'll either have to sell it or pay to increase the size of your inventory.Important items like door keys and objects needed to solve puzzles don't take up any inventory space, and are stored in a separate, bottomless menu—which is one major way Village streamlines the classic Resident Evil formula. Treasure doesn't take up any inventory space either, so you can carry around as many crystal skulls as you like. I must admit, I miss the old system, where picking up a key might mean sacrificing a weapon or some other helpful item. But it does mean less time spent in menus or backtracking to find item boxes, which, again, increases the overall pace of the game.Compared to RE7, Village has a much more interesting structure. A large, open square in the centre of the village acts as a hub, from which all the major locations in the game branch off, locked by a series of keys. This is a safe zone, similar to the main hall of RE2's police station, and you revisit it frequently. Here you get easy access to The Duke, as well as the entrances to each villain's lair. The village is also hiding several optional areas, which contain extra story details, rare treasure, and minibosses. This rewards you for taking the time to wander off the beaten path and explore.Although Resident Evil 7 had the feel of a soft reboot, only lightly touching on the series' larger mythology, Village contains some major revelations that impact every game in the series in hindsight. If you're a fan of these stories and you feel like the last few games have been light on new information about this universe and characters, Village will not disappoint. But the important thing is that it's not one of those Resi sequels that bombards you with dumb new lore. These revelations are big and important, but sit quietly in the background, letting Ethan's story stand on its own.Finishing the story unlocks a store where you can purchase a selection of extras with an in-game currency earned by unlocking achievements. These include a return of The Mercenaries, a fan favourite arcade/time attack mode. In Village's take on it, you can buy items and weapons from The Duke between rounds. But otherwise it remains faithful to the mode popularised by Resi 4. There's a New Game+ mode too, which lets you carry your weapons and character upgrades over to a second, harder playthrough.Village can occasionally feel like half a dozen different horror games jammed together. But the strength and variety of its ideas, the quality of the art direction, and its darkly evocative atmosphere more than make up for it. It's a bold and experimental horror game, but also one that leans into the series' past glories—particularly Resident Evil 4. There's a lot of Mikami's 2005 reinvention here, from the enigmatic merchant and weapon upgrades, to the rural setting and corrupted villagers. But ultimately, Village is its own game with its own identity, and the elements it borrows from earlier sequels never define it. This is a quality horror game in its own right, and proof Resident Evil still has the power to thrill, surprise, and scare 25 years on.A grimly beautiful collection of killer horror set-pieces, with some of the most memorably grotesque enemies in Resi history.If it’s set in space, Andy will probably write about it.

Eurogamer,"Lycan subscribe.Everywhere I look, the empty gaze of one - two, three, five; oh my god, dozens of - glassy eyes are staring back, watchful and hateful. They chitter merrily to each other as I tear through rooms, desperately seeking the outlier secreted somewhere in the mass of giggling, squirming china dolls. Twice I run out of time - I'm so panicked, I don't even see the thing when it's right in front of me - and then they swarm me, lifting horrifying, segmented appendages to attack, and I properly scream this time, loud enough that my next-door neighbour hears me via an open window and hesitantly knocks on the door to ensure I'm okay.
It's not entirely Capcom's doing that I'm a screamy, jumpy mess - I effed myself up watching the (terrible) 1987 horror Dolls when I was still in junior school and my fear of those frozen china faces has never quite left me - but it's as though the developer reached into my brain, jotted down my worst nightmare, stuck it in Resident Evil Village, and then forced me to relive it. 
It is to the developer's credit, however, that this neat, traditional home is such a triumph of understated spooks and masterful level design. Later, when I'm lost within a labyrinthine factory that long outstays its welcome, I'll realise how unusual - and special - House Beneviento is; even if I wasn't quite able to appreciate it while I was trapped there, racing through shadowy corridors and frantically hunting for a place to hide. It's terrifyingly brilliant and brilliantly terrifying in equal measure.
Village picks up where RE7 left off, and we reprise our role of Ethan Winters, he of I-can-staple-my-severed-hand-back-on-with-chem-fluid fame. I'm not going to go into any of the specifics because even a light tease will spoil not just the story but the pacing, too, but just like RE7, Village is very much a game of two halves, and that's not necessarily a good thing. It's a shame, really, because the first half of Village is bloody spectacular - literally.
Early locations like House Beneviento are Resident Evil Village at its best. Later, when you're touting a small armoury and blasting away wave after wave of Lycans - a fancy word for werewolves - you'll forget how small and weak you felt in earlier segments. It's not that I stomped through the entire game feeling bigger and stronger than I was - your supplies are rare and not always easy to spot, so, observing full survival horror tradition, Ethan is often on the cusp of running out of supplies and crafting ingredients - but there's a surprising turn in the final act that means the game you finish is very different to the one you began. 
That said, I found Village's combat less vexing than its predecessor, and its boss fights are considerably less complex, although I'll leave it to you to decide if that's a good thing or a bad one. Yes, there are some tanky fights - even though I attack as much as I can with my knife to preserve ammo, I still often found myself running low - and I feel there's a stronger emphasis on combat this time around, perhaps closer to RE5 and 6 than its immediate predecessor. But only late-game - and you'll understand what I mean by that when you get there yourself - did I feel stacked to the point of invincibility.
It should come as no surprise, then, that there's a good array of weapons, which is just as well, as you'll get to use all of them - even the guns you don't like so much - due to limited ammo. A mysterious travelling merchant, Duke, pops up at strategic points along the way with supplies, upgrades, and more, to help keep Ethan in tip-top shape, and even though ammo is scarce, you'll nonetheless spend as much time in your inventory moving stuff around to maximise space - pro tip: upgrade your inventory at every opportunity you get - as you do taking down agitated werewolves. And while, ostensibly, less bloodthirsty players can opt for flight instead of fight, my experience of the narrow village streets and castle corridors suggests this might be harder in practice than in theory. 
Sadly, there's no opportunity to head back to mop up missing recipes or collectables, either. Once the game is over, it's over, so if you're a completionist, all I can say is: slow down. It's not super long - I finished the campaign in 12.5 hours on standard difficulty, and a lot of that time was spent happily backtracking to find missing items and/or considering puzzle solutions (two, in particular, had me stuck for an embarrassingly long time) - but it's so, so frustrating that once you hit a point of no return, there's no way to get back. Exploring the titular Village itself is such a pleasure - it's full of wonderful environmental storytelling and has so many secrets to share with you! - it's such a shame you're denied the chance to revisit once your war with the Four Lords of the Village is over.
The further into the story you progress, though, the weaker it becomes, as though the beginning and end were designed by two entirely different teams. I know there's always an element of this in all Resident Evil games - RE7's sudden pivot to the tanker section was so unexpected it gave me whiplash - but this disconnect impacts both momentum and atmosphere. Yes, there's plenty of diversity in its environments - you'll not just visit the village and Castle Dimitrescu but also a sunken town and a killing factory and an abandoned mine, amongst other places - but all four Lords are not created equally, which means your time with them won't feel equally validating, either. Some are terrifically frantic scrambles, but others are so weak and frustrating, they occasionally feel more like time-wasters than meaningful encounters.
There are more annoyances, too. Sometimes the button prompts don't pop when they should, which is frustrating at best and lethal at worst. Other times, the signposting is so weak, it's hard to know what you're meant to do next, and I wasted a lot of my precious ammo shooting invincible creatures that at the time, I didn't know were invincible. Despite its frosty exteriors, Resident Evil Village is a beautiful place with plenty of opportunities to abuse your screenshot button, but Capcom won't let you take in-game snaps (on PS5, anyway) unless it's via its own Photo Mode system which stamps every vignette with an ugly copyright notice - that is if it lets you take a screenshot at all. And no matter how much I increased the brightness in-game or on my TV, it was still too bloody dark to see what was going on half the time.
Sackable offences? Of course not. And for all these flaws, Resident Evil Village was a thrilling adventure that kept me hooked from beginning to end, despite its jarring twists and turns. But the delightful level design isn't enough to mitigate a strange, unsatisfying, plothole-ridden story, and that bizarre final act ultimately sullies what is an otherwise terrifyingly good horror romp.

Metro GameCentral,"GameCentral reports back from its early hours with Resident Evil Village and how PSVR2 transforms an okay game into an excellent one.A lot has been said about Sony’s increasingly uncommunicative nature, which over the last year or two has seen them transform into virtual recluses, their only interaction with the outside world being anodyne blog updates on the official website. In practice Microsoft isn’t any different but Microsoft hasn’t had anything much to talk about for the last year, whereas Sony has, and they’ve made a complete hash of promoting the PlayStation VR2.Based on the launch line-up of games, especially key title Horizon Call Of The Mountain, the PlayStation VR2 is an overly expensive luxury with no new games of note. However, based on the VR updates for Gran Turismo 7, No Man’s Sky, and Resident Evil Village – none of which were available for review before launch – that sizeable price tag feels like the deal of the decade.There is a State of Play showcase this week, that may reveal further new VR games (but, according to Sony themselves, probably not first party titles), but if you were interested in PlayStation VR2 but on the fence because of the uninspiring launch line-up then we can safely say, despite not having beaten it yet, that Resident Evil Village is an absolutely essential VR experience. And it certainly doesn’t hurt that the update itself is completely free.Although it’s a competent game that has some fun moments, we weren’t big fans of Resident Evil Village when it was first released in 2021 (oddly, it seems longer ago than that now). The fact that it barely even attempted to be scary wasn’t necessarily an issue but, unlike the similarly positioned Resident Evil 4, the action wasn’t good enough to compensate and the awkward attempts to replicate the unintentionally cheesy tone of the earlier games never really worked.The VR update is a very small download but it does come with the proviso that you have to start the game again from scratch, so you can’t just switch on VR mode and use it with any of your previous saves.There’s no new story content but the game does now start off with a VR tutorial that teaches you the default settings and controls, which have you moving around as normal on the left stick but turning in 20°, or thereabouts, steps. Your mileage will almost certainly vary but we found this worked without any problems or nausea, beyond a slight tug on the frontal lobe, that slowly disappeared the longer we played the game.Unsurprisingly, there is no third person option, even if you have the Winters’ Expansion DLC, but the first thing you notice is that instead of just hands you also have virtual arms, at least as far as the elbow. It’s not the full virtual body of Gran Turismo 7 but it’s definitely an improvement on Call Of The Mountain, especially as you can pull out a knife on your left forearm, and have an utility belt and weapons you can grab and use at your waist.There’s also a torch in your jacket, the right breast of which suddenly decloaks when you reach for it, which is slightly odd.What you quickly realise, even just using the tutorial’s firing range, is that the weapons are amazing in VR. Putting a new clip into your sidearm, you have to slap it in and then pull back the slide, in what is a lengthy but hugely atmospheric routine. Aiming is extremely precise but you’re advised to ‘hold’ the gun with both hands in order to improve accuracy and reduce recoil.The shotgun works in a similar manner, as you manually push the shells into the gun and then pump the forearm between every shot, which we’re sure someone told us you don’t actually need to do, and is only for movies, but feels great in VR. The sniper rifle is even better, as you peer down the sights and then pull the bolt back to chamber the next round.We don’t know if we’re going to feel as enthusiastic about all that when we get to the section towards the end of the game, with the big hall full of werewolves, but in terms of setting the mood and making you feel like you’re wielding a real weapon it’s absolutely perfect.Starting the game proper you do begin to see some of the limitations of VR, with a couple of sequences near the beginning where you fall on the floor and yet you’re still standing in the real world, exactly as you were. Capcom attempts to compensate for this by moving the camera to where your character’s head would be but it just looks like you’ve fallen through the floor, as your suddenly opaque virtual body moves unconvincing around you.There’s also a moment when a cut scene just switches to displaying on a 2D virtual screen but, overall, the game looks and feels amazing. The family home you start in is utterly convincing in VR, even if you are viewing 3D objects and textures from much closer up than originally intended. The inflatable ball, and other toys, in the kid’s bedroom still move about when you get near them, but in VR that seems all the more realistic, even disconcertingly so.We say the game wasn’t designed with VR in mind but we’re not sure that’s true. Capcom already did an excellent job with the VR mode for Resident Evil 7, so we imagine they had support for Village in mind all along. If they didn’t then the sequence near the start, where you stumble through the snow in the dark, is, entirely by accident, one of the best VR experiences we’ve ever had.The interactivity plays a big part, as tree branches are pushed out of your way in such a realistic manner we more than once tried swatting at them purely on instinct. Add to that ominous animal/monster noises, the fact that you’ve no idea where you’re going (well, if you haven’t played it before), and the frustratingly feeble torch and it’s a wonderful way to start a survival horror.The reveal at the end of the sequence, of an ancient looking town and a castle above it, is just the video game equivalent of a matte painting, but despite its fake-ness being more obvious in VR the overall effect is still far more awe-inspiring than before.From there, it’s into the apparently empty town, as you poke around in houses filled with interactive furniture and bottles of medicine (which you now physically open and pour over yourself). Then you start to hear the really ominous noises, as something heavy runs about on the roof and then appears to smash through a wall, just moments before you arrive on the scene.We should emphasise again that, unless you have a very nervous disposition, the flatscreen version of Village is not really very scary at all. But even though we knew what was going to happen the first proper look at a monster is still terrifying, especially as you’re so poorly armed at the beginning of the game. What was originally a fairly ordinary first person shooter on a normal television is transformed into a virtual experience that looks and feels like a real matter of life or death.Alan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNew Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart bundle is £50 off reveals leakXbox will be less hands-off with Bethesda amid major reorganisationNever mind the massed werewolves at the end, we’re now worrying how we’re going to cope with that sequence in House Beneviento, which was the only properly scary bit in the original. That whole section, and its approach, was more atmospheric than the rest and we suspect that it’s all going to be completely terrifying in VR.Assuming we can muster the courage, we’ll report back on the rest of the game when we’ve completed it but if what we’ve described sounds like something you’d be interested in (i.e. you have at least a passing interest in survival horror) then we can’t recommend the VR mode, and by association the PlayStation VR2, enough.Email gamecentral@metro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter.

Metro GameCentral,"The eighth entry in the Resident Evil saga features werewolves, vampires, and a lot of nods to Resident Evil 4 – but is it any good?If it weren’t for the pandemic the eighth mainline Resident Evil game would’ve presumably been released on the 25th anniversary of the franchise, back in March. That would’ve been a nice nod to the series’ illustrious history, but in truth this new game features few characters or plot points to tie it to the original games. As a soft reboot of the series, Resident Evil 7 laid some solid new foundations, so the question now is how well Village builds upon it.Village is a direct story sequel to Resident Evil 7, complete with a short ‘previously on Resident Evil’ catch-up movie before you start. If you haven’t played the last game, it’s easy enough to follow along, as beyond a few references this is essentially a standalone adventure, as Ethan Winters and his family relocate to an unnamed Eastern European country (where everyone talks in American accents and writes in English) in order to try and restart their lives.As a continuation of the last game, Village maintains the same first person viewpoint but rather than the very first Resident Evil, the main inspiration here is Resident Evil 4. The connection shouldn’t be overstated though, as while there are similarities in terms of the setting and the increased amount of action there are key differences too – the most obvious being that Village is nowhere near as innovative or effortlessly entertaining.The game’s story begins with Ethan and his family enjoying some domestic bliss, only to be interrupted when Chris Redfield turns up to murder his wife and kidnap his daughter. He offers no explanation for this apparent heel turn and before you know it you’ve been taken prisoner and then wake up on a snowy mountainside, after your captors are killed by unknown assailants.They don’t stay unknown for long though, as you discover that the nearby village has a werewolf problem. It’s not long before you’re captured a second time and discover that there are four squabbling siblings controlling the area, including internet favourite Lady Dimitrescu. (We had imagined the game would play more with the question of whether what is going on is supernatural or not, but the issue is essentially ignored by the script and left only for you to ponder on.)Although the game starts off as a slow burn, the plot and characters get increasingly absurd, with Resident Evil 7’s attempts to appear at least a little more grounded than normal soon being abandoned. This seems to be an attempt to embrace the lunacy of Resident Evil 4, with some similar set pieces and a number of impromptu siege situations, but these are quickly abandoned in favour of more generic action.That doesn’t imply the action isn’t any good, as the gunplay is far better than other games where it’s more obviously a focus. But although ammunition and health is limited, in typical Resident Evil fashion, you’re rarely that short of it as long as you play the game reasonably cautiously. Village isn’t a first person shooter in the Call Of Duty sense but because you’re usually well armed, and given the enemies become so implausible, it is, just like Resident Evil 4, almost impossible to be scared by what’s going on.That’s not to say there aren’t some tense moments, especially before you realise how limited the artificial intelligence is, but the only genuinely frightening sequence involves a section of the game where you can’t use weapons and there’s a more psychological threat than normal. We’re not going to spoil what happens but while it does go for some low-hanging fruit, in terms of what’s likely to make you uncomfortable, it’s effective and doesn’t outstay its welcome. It’s also the only time the game really surprises you, with something that hasn’t been done in Resident Evil before.Conversely, the other most enjoyable section is probably Lady Dimitrescu’s castle, which looks suspiciously similar to the Spencer Mansion from Resident Evil 1. It works in a similar manner too, with less straight action than most of the rest of the game, although there’s little need for any real stealth. In fact, the whole game is extremely easy on normal difficulty and we only ever saw the game over screen during a couple of pre-script sequences, where we weren’t sure where to go.We also hate to be the bearer of bad news, but Lady Dimitrescu isn’t really in the game that much. It’s a shame, as she’s a great character, but her role was obviously defined long before the internet took a shine to her.In terms of mechanics and atmosphere Resident Evil Village does everything right. The graphics are excellent, even if there is a disappointing amount of object pop-in, and the soundtrack appropriately lacking in subtlety. Tonally though, the game is in a very awkward spot, between the unintended cheese of the originals and the more straightlaced remakes.There is some truly awful dialogue in the game (an attempt at some fourth wall breaking banter is genuinely so bad it’s good) but while most of it seems to be included knowingly, the game never really plays it up in a way that makes it seem funny.The bosses are written almost like pantomime characters but they’re never anywhere near as much fun as they should be. Village doesn’t even come close to mimicking the tone of Resident Evil 4, but where it also struggles is in the novelty of its action and set pieces. In Resident Evil 4 you never knew what was coming next but despite all the different environments, and more enemy variety than the last game (although still not that much), you never feel that way about Village.The core problem is that, at the end of the day, Village is a first person shooter and the world is hardly short of those. However, Resident Evil 4 practically invented the concept of the third person shooter and as much as the controls are criticised nowadays the inability to move and shoot at the same time made the action feel completely different to anything else. That ensured not just novelty but that much of the enjoyment of the game came from learning and refining a new set of skills.Village does nothing wrong, but it cannot complete with the more innovative entries in the franchise. Even Resident Evil 7, which got progressively less interesting as it went on, was a lot scarier and unpredictable than this and there’s certainly nothing in Village that measures up to its predecessor’s opening hours.One of the issues with Resident Evil 7 is that it only had a running time of around 10 hours and didn’t offer much replay value. On that count though Village is considerably better, as although it only lasts around the same length of time the New Game+ is more compelling and for the first time in almost a decade there’s a proper Mercenaries mode. As usual for the mode, the story locations are chopped up and turned into arcade style time attack levels where you try to get the highest score possible in the shortest time.Alan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNew Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart bundle is £50 off reveals leakXbox will be less hands-off with Bethesda amid major reorganisationMercenaries is a lot of fun, in part thanks to the cheesier presentation, but it runs into the same problem as the story campaign in that while Resident Evil 4’s take on Mercenaries was made more interesting by its unusual controls the opposite is true of Village and its stock first person action.Village is a very competently made game, whose ending hints at a new direction for the series, but there’s no way it’s going to go down as a classic in its own right. It’s perfectly enjoyable but it’s also quickly forgettable. At some point it may be seen as a transition step towards whatever Resident Evil becomes in the future but for now it’s perilously close to being Resident Evil by numbers. The series has suffered much worse sequels in its past, but it’s also had a number that were considerably better than this.In Short: A competent but uninspired sequel that’s unwise to create so many obvious comparisons to Resident Evil 4, although it still manages to find some memorable moments of its own.Pros: Solid action, some fun enemies, and generally good graphics. Most of the more experimental elements work well and there’s a decent amount of variety. Great soundtrack.Cons: There’s no real gameplay innovation and too many nods to previous entries in the series. The cheesy dialogue doesn’t really work. Very easy and quite short. Not very scary.Score: 7/10Formats: PlayStation 5 (reviewed), Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and StadiaPrice: £54.99Publisher: CapcomDeveloper: CapcomRelease Date: 7th May 2021Age Rating: 18Email gamecentral@metro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter.

Find out more about our reviews policy.I feel like I want to give Resident Evil Village a running commentary of scores, such is the range and variety of its sections: 8, 9 (...Jesus, maybe a 10?), 8, 7, 6… There's so much going on but it chops and changes from beat to beat in such a way you can almost see the line between sections. Most noticeably it feels like there's a real difference between the first and second half. The opening is strong, clever, and fun - full of atmosphere and intrigue as you explore (and features a part that's probably one of the best stand-alone horror levels of the year). While the latter half veers into 'okay' territory, with some combat slogs, a boss fight that's a bit of a stretch even by Resident Evil standards and, while it's still good, it lacks the same spark and craft as the beginning. Release date:May 7, 2021

Developer:  Capcom
Publisher:  CapcomTo be clear, I enjoyed Resident Evil Village, as when it's great it's on fire. Characters are entertaining, there are some lovely 'holy shit what?' twists and turns, while exploring and unlocking the titular village is satisfying. But it does feel like a mishmash of directions. Early rumors suggested this started life as Resident Evil Revelations 3, before being reworked and upgraded to a Resident Evil 7 sequel, and having finished it I can believe that. The change between the first and second halves feels like a gradual drift from the sinister tone of the last game, to Revelations' louder, fun action movie vibe. That said I'm going to have to try to explain as much as I can without spoiling anything, because Capcom has impressively managed to keep about 90% of the game secret and only shown off the first maybe three or four hours. Almost everything I could mention that isn't Vampire Mommy or a werewolf will be a surprise I don't want to ruin. It opens strong as you explore the village via a dark forest full of things just out of sight. Something terrible has happened, with body parts and blood scattered like gory narrative confetti. This 'what the hell is going on?' stage is great, as the world does most of the talking and it's a beautiful place to explore. Even the most mundane bits of table crap and floor detritus in the village are incredibly crafted - I spent far too long just looking at clutter. 'Monsters? Yeah, there's a bunch out there somewhere but just look at this dirty table with a rusty pot on it.' The level of detail is never less than impressive - Castle Dimitrescu alternates between the fading finery of its halls, and crumbling dank cellars and dungeons. I don't think I passed a single shelf in the game without looking it over. It's these opening sections that feel the most well crafted and balanced. The monsters in the castle besides Dimitrescu and her daughters are the ghoulish female Moroaică (Dimitrescu eats men and enslaves women apparently). They're creepy, lumbering, and slow - the threat mainly coming from your own mistakes. The ability to guard against attacks and follow up with a kick to push back enemies adds an interesting dimension to combat and means it's not just about deciding between shooting and backing off. The Lady of the house and her children, when they appear, are more of a set piece adding brief, intense, structured encounters to vary the mix. Like the best Resident Evil moments the castle is a sort of danger-filled puzzle box you crisscross and backtrack through to open up new areas and progress further. For most of the game this is true of the village itself too. As well as the story push to new places, there are plenty of secrets and extras to find off the prescribed path as you expand the map. I spent a good deal of time exploring and retreading roads with new keys and tools, and was usually surprised with additional monsters, resources, cash, or crafting materials. Resident Evil games are always about backtracking to open up locked areas, but this is the first time it's almost dabbled with an open-world feel. It's not strictly free-roaming but the village is a constantly expanding hub you return to. Without spoiling anything, there are several areas you have to visit to progress the story, and each is a finite, self-contained section in its own right. Castle Dimitrescu, and a location that comes after, are amazing, incredible high points - clearly lavished with attention and love that shines through as you play. The second place you visit is amazing, and hands down one of the best horror moments I've played in a long time. After this, however, things get a little more perfunctory. The third area is fine, although it's a bit light on any real depth and oddly paced so that it feels like it's over fast and skipped bits without telling you. The fourth area is good, and features one of the more interesting characters, but it gets a little monotonous with its 'thing'. There's more after that, obviously, but I'm not going to say anything. The constant shifting of styles and ideas, while inconsistent, works well, and creates constant excitement about what's coming, even if it doesn't always hit the high notes reached elsewhere. The pacing does feel inconsistent though - depending on how much you explore between sections, key beats can feel weirdly short, or artificially extended. It's worth noting that it isn't the longest game however you play - even scouring for secrets, collectibles and completing just about everything on the map, my save only clocked in at 13 hours. I know someone else that took a more direct story route and completed it in six.Oddly, for a series known for its puzzles, it's the one area where the quality is consistently… low. Bar one brilliant set piece sequence most of the challenges feel phoned in - there's a treasure map that leads you to an obvious, completely unhidden locked gate you previously passed during a scripted sequence, while one puzzle literally has the solution next to it; not some enigmatic hint you have to decrypt, just the answer, next to the buttons you need to press. Most of what passes for puzzles boils down to finding something later you then take back to somewhere you were earlier. It's also a shame (for me at least) that this is one of the 'not a horror game' Resident Evils. There are scares and some lovely creepy bits, especially at the start, but Resident Evil Village is mostly a big shooty action game. After Resident Evil 7's creepy tension, Village's extended gun battles with crowds of werewolves feel brash and occasionally fumbling. Less is more works best: a few Lycans becomes an interesting and tactical tussle to survive - a massive pack of them is a pain. Later in the game, you'll end up fighting waves of Lycans. It's meant to be escalating a midpoint towards a sense of climax, but the incessant barrage is more wearing than anything else. The Resident Evil combat model has always been about feeling weak in the face of danger, so throwing you in what amounts to a furry Call of Duty section doesn't play to its strengths. There are also a few boss fights that don't feel like they were designed for first-person - there's a lot of running out the way of big telegraphed attacks in large open spaces where you're battling your limited movement more than the monster. Sprint is basically a light jog and doesn't have the zip to really get you clear of danger. Plus trying to avoid things means turning away from the threat, guesstimating when you're safe and then whipping the camera around to see what's going on. For one key battle in particular I spent most of my time with my back to an enemy because of the timing required to get clear of a near insta-kill attack. Despite some of the issues I've mentioned I enjoyed Resident Evil Village, I'm on a second playthrough already and it's still good. If I sound like I'm down on it in a few places it's only because the excellence of some parts only highlights some of the more ordinary moments. The first half is great, the characters are interesting throughout, and exploring and unraveling the location never gets old. It's only in the latter half where things start to alternate between some good bits, some fumbles, and at least one moment of 'oh my God, what?!' shark-jumping excess that wouldn't look out of place in a Fast and Furious trailer... It feels like a fun but flawed mix between the camp excess of older games, and the more modern feel of the last installment. One thought that kept popping into my head while I was playing was just remembering how good Resident Evil 7 was. I recently completed another playthrough in preparation for this (along with some Revelations and Veronica, just because) and number 7's reverse home invasion slasher terror is still up there as one of the greatest horror games of all time. Resident Evil Village is an enjoyable, occasionally silly, monster hunt that's entertaining but almost completely resets all the incredible work Resident Evil 7 did to reinvent the series.  Reviewed on PS5 with code provided by the publisher.I'm GamesRadar's Senior Guides Co-ordinator, which means I run GamesRadar's guides and tips content.

Game Informer,"Not all monsters hide in the shadows. Ethan Winters discovers this within minutes of setting foot in this isolated village at the foot of a medieval castle. The sun has barely burned off the morning mist when ravenous, fang-toothed horrors attack him. Resident Evil Village’s opening hour establishes an incredibly tense tone, weaving together moody, atmospheric horror with rollercoaster firefights that leave Ethan within an inch of his life. And, like an ultramarathon runner, Village maintains this thrilling pace until its closing credits.Ethan’s journey forces him to explore a ramshackle shantytown, blood-soaked wine cellars, and a creepy mansion littered with animated porcelain dolls. These locales are perfect backdrops for a series of blood-curdling encounters. My stomach lurched as a deformed baby-like mutation chased me through a dimly lit basement, and I had to stop and catch my breath after a harrowing shootout with a snarling truck-sized hound. Village’s environment and enemy design are superb, making it one of the scariest Resident Evil games to date.Ethan slowly amasses the usual assortment of shotguns, pistols, and grenade launchers to combat this assortment of otherworldly horrors. Village’s arsenal doesn’t hold many surprises, but the overall gunplay is more polished than what we had in its predecessor. Running from Village’s slow-marching enemies isn’t difficult, but navigating their flurry of fangs is still a thrill. Staying calm long enough to line up a series of headshots while these hordes bear down on your position is the true challenge, and I walked away from most encounters with a rush of adrenaline. A handful of other adversaries – such as a meme mistress Lady Dimitrescu – relentlessly hound Ethan throughout the game, much like RE 2’s Mr. X. You never know when one of these villains will stroll around a corner, which creates a palpable tension, but these sequences always eventually resolved themselves in an epic, resource-draining boss battle.When I wasn’t battling tooth and claw for my life, I was scanning every room from floor to ceiling, looking for more ammo, healing items, and other valuable tools. Like previous Resident Evil games, Village’s map does a stellar job communicating which rooms have been cleared out and which still contain a few hidden treasures. However, some items are better hidden than others. On the one hand, Village encouraged me to pour over its intricately detailed environments with a fine-toothed comb; I enjoyed most of these scavenger hunts, and checking a room off my map was always satisfying. On the other hand, a few items remained stubbornly hidden even after several minutes of scouring, so trying to find every item in every room became a little tedious. Fortunately, even a cursory search of each room yields enough gear to get you through the trials ahead.Developing a keen eye for detail is also vital for solving Village's handful of environmental puzzles. I love how these puzzles offer a much-needed tension release, and most of Village’s puzzles left me feeling clever. Unfortunately, a couple of puzzle solutions are obscured by fuzzy logic. For example, I had to brute force my way through one puzzle that involved rotating statues, because its clues were misleading. Even after I’d stumbled into the solution, it still took me a while to work out the underlying logic. Fortunately, Village doesn’t throw many puzzles your way, and most of them are satisfyingly simple, so speedbumps are rare.Resident Evil Village’s narrative is more compelling than I expected. Ethan is still a bit of a bland everyman, but his journey to rescue his daughter is full of wild characters and a handful of surprising moments. Village’s narrative was never the main thing driving me forward, but I’m glad to see that Capcom actually put some thought into this world, and a few of the late game twists have me genuinely excited to see where the series goes next.Resident Evil Village is an impressive package. I loved the recent remakes of Resident Evil 2 and 3, but I’m excited to see Capcom push the series forward again. Village expands on Resident Evil 7: Biohazard’s approach to first-person combat, offering a series of white-knuckle encounters that perfectly complement Capcom’s unnerving environmental design. Thankfully, Village’s amplified action doesn’t diminish its horror. If anything, Village maintains a sense of dread that few games can match. If you have the intestinal fortitude for intense terror, playing Resident Evil Village is a great way to check your pulse.

Polygon,"Filed under:And both will get your blood pumpingOne of my favorite moments in Resident Evil Village is small enough that I almost didn’t notice it. After defeating a boss to get the item I needed to move forward, I returned to the titular town for the fourth time, basking in the gorgeous streaks of sunlight that pelted the abandoned houses I would skulk around at dusk. As I did my rounds to see if any new items had cropped up since my last search, I noticed them: a couple of ominous black goats now grazing just outside the graveyard.There’s no cutscene that announces them, no shriek of a violin to indicate they’re supposed to scare you. They just kind of show up. They’re never brought up or explicitly addressed again, these goats. I wasn’t frightened of them, but I was a little unnerved. Then, a couple of hours later, I was in the thick of the most absurd, over-the-top boss fight I think I’ve ever played in a Resident Evil game.Resident Evil has always had these kinds of fluctuations between slow horror creep and bombastic action. The first few games definitely had their share of ridiculous plots, but the exploration-based gameplay kept the focus on horror. When Resident Evil 4 adopted its landmark behind-the-shoulder perspective and rewarded headshots (and subsequent games refined the shooting even further), it raised the question: Can something that empowers the player this much still be a horror game?Polygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences.

Its first unsettling moment happens during a conversation between the game’s protagonist Ethan Winters and his wife, Mia. The Winters family has moved to Europe at the behest of series mainstay Chris Redfield, who showed up to rescue the pair at the end of Resident Evil 7; the couple has since had a child named Rose, and they’re trying to live a normal domestic life. After a chat about imported wines and local recipes, Ethan tries to bring up the torture they endured during RE7, but Mia shuts him down with a concerning terseness. Then, as if on cue, Chris and a team of soldiers inexplicably assault the Winters’ home and shoot Mia dead, kidnap Rose, and kick off a series of events that lead Ethan to a seemingly abandoned village in the middle of Europe to rescue his daughter. It’s a surprising turn, but it’s also Village establishing expectations for what it’s about to do over the next several hours.Village’s whiplash between horror and action is fierce at first. From the moment I start marching through an oppressively dark neck of European woods, the game is meticulous about how it paces every area, enemy encounter, and set-piece. Even early on, it will startle me with a foreboding look at an enemy in the distance — but won’t let them loose. When my guard is down, it blindsides me. It pits me against overwhelming odds, then, moments before I nearly die, saves me with a bell. Except ... wait. Hasn’t something like this happened before? Village often uses my knowledge of the series to surprise me and subvert my expectations. Capcom is hellbent on using any trick to throw me off-balance, but restrained enough to make its shocking moments count.Building on Resident Evil 7’s move to a first-person perspective and more isolated characters, Village is stingy with ammo and healing items at first, but it does ultimately center around shooting. Over time, I find more guns and ammo and fight a wider variety of enemies more frequently; by the end, I’m not really sweating how many bullets I have left. A shop run by a new character called the Duke lets me upgrade my guns, sell trinkets, and buy ammo (something that not even Resident Evil 4, the series’ first real venture into the shooter genre, allowed). It’s an enticing system that’s unfortunately anchored to the game’s worst character. The Duke is a boring, eye-rolling caricature of a fat person meant to cut through the tension of exploring all of these dreary locales. Most rooms he sets up shop in are decorated or fitted to highlight how fat he is; his stomach pops out of his clothes, revealing a bulging, desaturated pouch. He’s constantly spouting lines like, “To be hungry ... is to be alive.” As if that weren’t enough, health and defense upgrades come from finding and killing farm animals to turn into meals for him, with his leftovers acting as my power-ups. As someone who’s struggled with their weight for most of their life, I found the Duke’s portrayal a frustrating reminder that yes, people still see the overweight as grotesque and slovenly.Despite my issues with the Duke, his wares and weapon upgrades forced me to put up with him. Each gun feels hefty, and while blowing a shotgun pellet through an enemy’s head feels good, the aiming isn’t so precise that it seems mechanical or easy. I had to actively learn to aim these guns, whether that meant lining up multiple enemies so I could pierce them all with a sniper rifle, or wrangling the aim assist so I could pull off consecutive headshots with a handgun. Even after beating the game, I enjoyed a few rounds of the postgame Mercenaries mode just so I could spend more time blasting Lycans with the game’s guns. Village also has a metagame unlock system that offers plenty of reasons to replay the game multiple times at higher difficulties, which I plan on doing.In spite of all the firepower I amass, the ramp from survival horror to all-out shooter isn’t as predictable as it usually is. Village is a much larger game than Resident Evil 7, physically speaking, although it takes about the same amount of time to play, coming in at a brisk 10 or so hours. It covers way more ground than the Baker family’s territory and uses that extra room to give each area its own flavor and tone, and it even sneaks in some cool detours to discover. Every time I set foot outside the village, I can feel myself entering someone else’s domain. Some areas stay more linear in favor of elaborate set-pieces, while others are entirely puzzle-oriented.The first of these, Castle Dimitrescu, has me lurking its halls looking for a way out, eventually being stalked by a formidably tall vampiress named Lady Dimitrescu as I work to unravel her plans and escape. I hate to say it, but despite how much the internet loves her, she’s one of Village’s big disappointments: While she trudges around her castle the way Mr. X haunted the Resident Evil 2 remake’s police station, she’s much too slow and predictable to cause any real tension. Seeing her peek her head through a critical doorway is less terrifying and more eye-rolling as I sprint back to the nearest save room, or run in serpentine paths until she’s bored of me.Her castle does provide the first real taste of that other Resident Evil trademark: a labyrinthe area full of locked doors and hidden keys to pry them all open. Unfurling the giant puzzle box and turning your in-game map from red (denoting that you haven’t found every item in a given room) to blue (after I’ve scooped everything up) is a slow but immensely fulfilling burn. The actual puzzles to get those keys and clear those rooms are pretty simple, but throughout it all, Village drip-feeds just enough items and clues to nudge me forward, throwing in some fun curveballs as I’m heading toward a lock with a key in tow. Each of these sections lets Village turn the dial from horror to action on a dime, and each turn of that dial produces at least one incredible moment, whether it’s a major boss fight, a not-so-subtle reference to another Resident Evil game, or a small, creepy detail like those goats.By the end of the game, I have way more guns and ammo than I know what to do with, and the scale of activities gets as outlandish as the series ever does. But Village is so meticulous about how it paces every area, enemy encounter, and set-piece that it doesn’t matter as much. It regularly offsets my increased firepower with enemies I don’t even want to look at, let alone fight. At one point, the game pits me against a pair of absurdly built enemies in an aggravatingly tight space, and the fact that I have more than enough explosives to deal with them doesn’t do much to calm me down. There’s a potent, albeit different, kind of horror in giving the player all the empowerment they can handle and still finding ways to rattle them.Eventually, the swings between horror and action became so common that, moment to moment, I had no idea what I’d see next. That’s the cycle that Resident Evil Village keeps chasing: the hesitation, anticipation, and payoff that make both action and horror such powerful draws. It’s definitely an action game, and despite all the shooting, it’s also a horror game. And while it induces both creeping dread and righteous fury, its biggest triumph is in not-so-quietly arguing that horror and action aren’t that different after all. They’re both just ways to get your blood pumping. Resident Evil Village will be released May 7 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.

GameSpot,"The sequel to Resident Evil 7 leans heavily on Resident Evil 4's brand of action, but adds its own sensibilities to the mix.By 
    Phil Hornshaw
   on May 5, 2021 at 8:00AM PDTOver its 25-year history, the Resident Evil series has continually changed and evolved, like a mad scientist who injects himself with a questionable bio-weapon, mutating into something new every time he shows up. For the most part, those evolutions have been fascinating recombinations of elements as Resident Evil tries different mixes of survival-horror and action gameplay. With Resident Evil 7, Capcom swung for the fences with a first-person perspective, a narrower scope, and more horror-focused gameplay. Resident Evil Village evolves that idea to make something that feels very different from its predecessor, but which is just as engaging.Though the perspective and mechanical underpinnings are the same, Village branches off in its own direction from RE7, capturing some of the things that were great about that game while resisting the impulse to retread the same ground. While it's still frightening at points, it takes a less horror-driven tack on the same underlying first-person formula. Village continues to evolve Resident Evil while maintaining a keen grasp on some of its core tenets, finding new ways (or reviving old ones) of getting under your skin and ratcheting up the tension.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Resident Evil Village Video ReviewAs has been pretty clear for a while now, Resident Evil Village is Resident Evil 7 through the lens of Resident Evil 4. When the latter was released way back in 2005, it significantly revamped what the franchise had been up to that point, swapping the earlier games' slower, survival-horror focus for a more fast-paced action approach. RE4 was scary because you were being overwhelmed by enemies, backed into corners, and chased by madmen wielding chainsaws. It traded darkened corridors and jump scares for adrenaline-fueled panic.So while RE7 leans into the dark and creepy haunted house idea of the very first Resident Evil, Village transforms that take by taking cues from the faster, panickier RE4. It's again played from a tight, closed-in first-person perspective that has you constantly wondering what's behind you, and it still often focuses on slower movement and exploration through its gorgeous, twisting environments. But Village's approach is distinctly more action-centric, and it's remarkable how much Capcom has managed to push the formula of its reboot to the series in such a different direction.Village picks up on Resident Evil 7's story three years later, again focusing on protagonist Ethan Winters. After rescuing his wife Mia from the Baker house and subsequently getting saved by Resident Evil franchise mainstay Chris Redfield, Ethan and Mia went into hiding with Chris' help, moving to Europe to restart their lives. They've since had a daughter, and while they're trying to put their lives back together, Ethan continues to struggle with the trauma he experienced. Mia, meanwhile, keeps trying to put the subject out of her mind and even seems to be struggling to remember it. But before Ethan can really get to the bottom of why his wife is acting kinda weird about the whole ""survived being tormented in a house full of monsters"" trauma they shared, Chris and his team bust into the couple's house and drag Ethan and baby Rose off.Ethan wakes up some time later after a car crash. The two random special forces guys who were transporting him and Rose are dead. Ethan wanders through the snowy woods in search of his missing child, until he hits a ramshackle, seemingly empty village. Before long, he discovers it's under siege by what appear to be werewolves. It's all extremely reminiscent of the beginning of Resident Evil 4, which upended the RE formula by dropping you into a village overrun with enemies who acted like humans rather than shambling, mindless zombies. The lycans wield weapons and shoot arrows at you, and to avoid getting surrounded, you can run into houses and barricade the doors with furniture to slow their advances. The first major challenge in Village is to survive an onslaught of these creatures as you frantically try to create barricades, find weapons, and make a run for it before you're completely overwhelmed. Just like its 2005 inspiration, the opening battle of Village taps into a frightening intensity of trying to create a defensible position or take part in a running gunfight that you're in serious danger of losing. It's a completely different feeling from the slow-burn dread of RE7, whose combat builds fear from the realization that the number of bullets in your gun is not the same as the number of bullets you need to kill one of its lumbering Molded enemies. But Village's combat can make your heart pound just as hard.Really, the fact that Village feels like such a turn away from RE7 is what works about it--as a sequel, it feels like Capcom reaching for a new way to challenge itself. Most of the time in Village, at least on its standard difficulty, you'll find yourself well-outfitted for whatever you're about to face--the challenge is in using those resources effectively and keeping yourself alive. Village uses the same movement systems as RE7, which can feel a little slow and clunky at times; Ethan isn't especially agile and even at a sprint, it can feel like he's barely moving. Despite a sense of trudging through molasses, Village is tuned so that enemies also approach slowly and cautiously, so dealing with them comes together like a standoff that has you judging their moves or hitting their weak points before they have a chance to get in close and rip into you. It also adds to the tension as you try to navigate through areas to keep yourself out of danger--the first-person view means your awareness is very narrow, so staying hypervigilant about your surroundings is essential. Sometimes, you just have to run and hope you can find a better place to make your stand.While the controls work for tense moments when surrounded, they feel a little wobblier in boss battles. Here, you're often dodging attacks as a monster charges you or swings at you with a huge weapon. You can absorb some damage with the ability to hold up your hands in a guard, another holdover from RE7 that helps mitigate the limitations of your movement, but the better strategy is to try to run around a battlefield and get out of the way. That usually means sacrificing seeing what your opponent is doing so you can make a quick dash one way or the other, and it's a bit of a weird way to fight. Since Ethan can't step sideways while looking forward, you're constantly just sort of running for it and hoping whatever is coming at you doesn't hit you. It doesn't make these boss battles frustrating or add to their difficulty, but it does add a counterintuitiveness to combat that can take you out of the moment.Bullets are easy to come by, and if you're short, you can craft more from materials you find by searching your surroundings, or purchase them from the Duke, a traveling merchant with a penchant for showing up just when you need him. You'll find lots of guns and gun upgrades throughout the game, and you'll revisit the central town repeatedly to scour it for new hidden items. There's even a system for upgrading your character that involves animals like pigs and chickens scattered around the village. Shoot them and bring their meat to the Duke, he'll cook them into meals that increase your health, amp up your movement speed, or make your guard more effective. All that stuff you're carrying around has to go somewhere, so Village brings back the inventory management system of RE4: You have a suitcase full of weapons, ammo, and health items, with each item taking up spaces on a grid. For most of the game, you probably won't have to worry about this, but as things wear on, you'll start to find yourself hauling more and more gear. You can move items around to make sure they all fit in your case, Tetris-style, and purchase bigger cases from the Duke so you can bring more stuff--but this system is most interesting when it starts making you wonder if you should sell off old guns or toss less useful items in favor of things like extra ammo. Mercifully, crafting materials aren't counted in your inventory, so you're free to make bullets and health items on the fly. But planning what you do and don't need to pick up becomes a consideration in exploration, albeit never a major one.Though Village has far more variety of enemies to fight than RE7, it's not all shooting, with a lot of varied pacing and new challenges throughout. There are four different areas to unlock as you progress through the story, each headed by one of the Four Lords--the scary monster people who dominate the village and the area around it. The first is the castle run by Lady Dimitrescu (she of much internet fame), and while you'll spend lots of time popping the skulls of lycans in the village, there's a lot less shooting to be done in the castle portion. You'll occasionally face enemies you have to gun down, but much more time in the castle is spent navigating its tight corridors as Dimitrescu and her daughters--all seemingly vampires capable of turning themselves into clouds of bugs and recomposing themselves elsewhere--are hunting you. You can't kill Dimistrescu or her daughters with your conventional weapons, so you have to run if you're found. The entire level is spent exploring the castle, looking for the items you need to advance through the area, while listening for Dimistrescu's clomping footsteps and trying to keep away from her.Even in this very first new area, Village is mixing and remixing its experience with the different horror ideas. You're not just shotgunning tons of enemies, you're also engaging in stealth that's much more akin to what navigating the Baker house was like in RE7. Later portions of the game throw different obstacles into your path. There are puzzle-heavy levels reminiscent of the mansion of Resident Evil or the police station of Resident Evil 2. There are sections where you hear frightfully powerful enemies in the distance, and knowing you're going to have to face them down, begin heaping ammo into your pockets in preparation. And there are points that show Village can also hone in on some of the intense frights that made RE7 so remarkable--points that are too damn good to spoil here.Suffice to say that though Village gives you lots of guns and lets you use them, it also is great at maintaining an atmosphere of unease as you head around each new corner. You might have plenty of weapons, but can you handle what you're about to face? Will they even work against the next creature you encounter? There's an excellent balance between providing lots of action and maintaining that dread. This isn't the same kind of intense anxiety that RE7 conjured up, but Village encourages its own kind of fear, and it hits you with a few great RE7-like setpieces to ratchet up the tension when you least expect it. One particular ""oh crap"" moment with Dimitrescu comes to mind; others later in the game remind you that just because you have a lot of guns doesn't mean you're invincible. No two sections of Village are quite the same, and each draws on different aspects of past Resident Evil games to combine them with the underlying RE7 feel to create something that's both new and nostalgic. It's impressive how deftly the game can change into something a little different again and again throughout its runtime, and each section is fun, intense, and, naturally, frightening in its own way. The result is a game that clips right along, constantly throwing something new at you but always feeling like an interesting new take on what you already know and have experienced. It's a hodgepodge of Resident Evil ideas, yes, but each one is executed exceedingly well--this is a game that seems aware of the franchise's entire history and is able to summon its best elements at will.The caveat to that is the last hour of the game, where things take a weird, over-the-top turn. In the run-up to Village's final moments, the action gets turned up even higher, resulting in a final few enemy encounters that wind up feeling like needless digressions and don't add much to the overall package. Where past fights with hordes of lycans were intense affairs that required you to keep moving and pay careful attention to what you were facing, these last bits feel a bit like you've stepped through a portal into another game. For a few moments there, Village draws up the worst action-heavy portions of Resident Evil 6, losing track of what made you grit your teeth and clench your fists and exchanging it for something more akin to shooters like Call of Duty.This same moment highlights some of the inconsistency in Village's story. Despite pre-release imagery focused on the Umbrella corporation's logo appearing in the game, the way that Village connects with the larger RE franchise feels a bit tacked on. The same is true of Chris Redfield, who shows up here and there to say something cryptic without really revealing anything. The focus on Ethan's interactions with the Four Lords and uncovering what's going on in the village is more fun and interesting--these are antagonists who come off as petty and human. They don't particularly like each other but are all eager to torture and maim you anyway, and their interactions with Ethan and each other add dimension to their characters. In all, this isn't the best Resident Evil story, but it is a spooky romp with fun villains. It's just a shame that more time wasn't devoted to pulling on all the hanging story threads of RE7, or in tying it together with the franchise at large.Thankfully, the late-game digression doesn't last long, and the elements about the combat that are fun--the one-on-one or one-on-too-many sparring nature of fights, and finding ways to take down tough enemies before they can rip you apart--are transplanted into the fast-paced arcade mode The Mercenaries. This also feels like a lift straight out of Resident Evil 4; it takes the combat of Village, slaps a timer on it, and focuses it on scoring points. The Mercenaries is a fun side activity in its own right, always daring you to get a higher score by balancing taking down enemies quickly and trying to complete one of its given levels as fast as you can. It demonstrates how tight the combat in Village can be, although at times it can be held back a bit by the slow, underwater-feeling of movement around the battlefield. Another aspect of the Village package is Resident Evil Re:Verse, a multiplayer-focused mode in which you fight other players as both Resident Evil characters and monsters. Re:Verse is slated to release separately sometime this summer for Village buyers, but it wasn't included with our review copy.Resident Evil 7 was an excellent return to the horror underpinnings of the franchise, but cunningly altered with new ideas and a new perspective. Similarly, Village is an intelligent reintroduction of the best action elements of Resident Evil. Though it captures some of the same things that made RE7 such a breath of fresh air (or maybe rancid, stale, mold-filled air, but in a good way), Village evolves to become its own unique creature. It makes you wonder what beautifully twisted fiend Resident Evil might mutate into in the future.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"
Kotaku,"I remember vividly the first time I played one of my favorite games of all time, Resident Evil 4.While not what I would call a huge fan of the survival horror series before then, I voraciously devoured every bit of Resident Evil 4 info I could get my hands on leading up to its January 2005 release. My dad, who heard no end of my excited explanations of the story and mechanics, surprised me one day with a rental copy from our local Hollywood Video. I settled in that night to finally experience the horror myself, and after running into my first Dr. Salvador, called my friend over to play it with me. It was a huge moment, one that reignited my love for video games and, in hindsight, more than likely helped me find the path to my current career.I take this self-indulgent trip down memory lane because Resident Evil Village—releasing this Friday for everything but Switch—feels like Capcom’s attempt at remaking Resident Evil 4 without actually remaking Resident Evil 4. Despite a lack of real scares and an over-reliance on action over horror in its third act, Resident Evil Village is everything I wanted out of a new Resident Evil game. Combat is hefty and brutal, the monsters are unforgiving and relentless, and the set pieces are compelling enough to make up for some inconsistent pacing and difficulty. Moment to moment, Resident Evil Village consistently surprised me with its dips and turns, the way that first trip through Resident Evil 4 did.The franchise’s eighth main installment in everything but name, Resident Evil Village directly follows the story of 2017’s Resident Evil 7. Ethan Winters, the everyman protagonist introduced in the previous game alongside its new, first-person perspective, has settled down somewhere in Europe with his wife Mia and baby daughter Rosemary, three years after surviving the swamps of Louisiana. Village opens with an intimate view of their new life together, but there’s a cryptic undercurrent of discord that cuts through their domestic bliss. The torture they endured at the hands of the mold-infected Baker family still looms large in their lives, a lingering trauma they can’t seem to shake.Things take a turn before you’re given a chance to explore this dynamic. Someone riddles their home with bullets, and series mainstay Chris Redfield is revealed to be the orchestrator of the chaos. But this is a much different Chris than the one who contended with zombies in the original Resident Evil, punched boulders in Resident Evil 5, and most recently rescued the Winterses in Resident Evil 7. Grizzled and imposing, Chris shoots Mia and kidnaps Rosemary, leaving Ethan begging for answers.While Chris played a small, surprising role in the previous game, his introduction as a foil to Ethan in the opening of Resident Evil Village acts as a microcosm for the franchise. The series began its life taking down shambling zombies in 1996, but the threats soon became much more over-the-top. As such, so did its playable characters. Chris, who was barely more than SWAT in a small Midwestern town when he first entered the Spencer Mansion all those years ago, has since evolved into a near-superhuman figure in the Resident Evil universe. A normal dude like Ethan was inevitable and necessary when Resident Evil 7 ultimately returned the series to its less action-oriented, survival horror roots.Resident Evil Village forces you to wrestle with that history by placing one of these mythical ur-protagonists as opposition long before any monsters make the scene. Ethan has been through his fair share of danger, but it’s nothing compared to Chris’ now decades-long history of saving mankind from potentially world-ending threats. How do you overcome a man whose legacy has routinely escalated to the point of being supernatural? It’s a clever way of raising the stakes without immediately relying on a new, more fantastical bioweapon, and serves as a promising jumping off point for this new game.It’s here that discussing the plot of Resident Evil Village gets complicated. In giving Kotaku a copy of the game ahead of release, Capcom has placed multiple restrictions on what we can say about the game’s boss battles, cutscenes, and overall story. While I understand the need to preserve the surprise for players, it also means I can’t yet discuss some of Resident Evil Village’s most creative and effective moments. The basics—that Ethan ends up in the titular village in pursuit of his daughter’s captors—have been a central part of the game’s marketing, but there’s lots to talk around when it comes to other details.Ethan, confused and alone, is left to his own devices once he arrives in the village, allowing the player to get their bearings and explore a few of the abandoned shacks that make up the small community. The dated, dusty settlement feels like an obvious call back to the rural Spanish countryside of Resident Evil 4. It’s full of nooks and crannies, with several environmental clues that detail what life was like before tragedy arrived. Chickens and pigs wander aimlessly in untended pens, waiting to be butchered and used as ingredients in health- and defense-improving meals later on. Some areas remain hidden behind intricate locks, serving as brain-tickling reminders to come back and snoop around the hub area once the requisite keys have been found elsewhere.When Resident Evil Village gets back to shooting bad guys, it proves itself to be just as competent as its predecessor. If you’re at all familiar with Resident Evil 7, you’ll be able to jump into Village with very little learning curve, but with a few minor changes. The ability to press the left bumper to defend yourself from melee attacks still exists, and this time around, pressing it a second time pushes the enemy away, opening them up to a quick headshot or shotgun blast. Furniture can be moved in front of doorways to avoid being overrun and packs of flour can be shot to obscure your movement. In fact, running away is sometimes the best option just to save ammo and healing items—even the game’s grunts, ferocious beast men known as lycans, can prove deadly if you’re not ready for their animalistic feints and charges. Enemies drop items upon death, a feature from previous games that was absent in Resident Evil 7, and its return makes combat even more of a balancing act, asking you to weigh using ammo and losing health against the potential for making more money or finding vital crafting materials.""Ethan Winters' European Vacation""First-person survival horrorSimilarities to Resident Evil 4, Donna Beneviento, weighty gunplay.The inevitable action-heavy conclusion, mostly uninspired bosses.CapcomPlayStation 4, PlayStation 5 (played), Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Steam, StadiaMay 7, 202111 hours on Standard difficulty, with lots of exploration, back-tracking, gun upgrades, and ingredient-gathering along the way.Every gun, from the basic handgun given to Ethan at the start of the game to more powerful fare like the grenade launcher, feels great to shoot, especially with the haptics and pressure-sensitive triggers of the PlayStation 5’s DualSense controller. There’s even a neat little thing where the right trigger becomes incredibly loose between uses of weapons with low fire rates, like shotguns and sniper rifles, with tension only returning when they are ready to be fired again. This provides some really fun moments during more hectic encounters: I lost track of the number of times I cursed at my controller because it wasn’t allowing me to shoot an approaching monster, replicating what it must feel like to have an actual gun jam up in real-life combat situations.Another aspect of Resident Evil 4 echoed in Resident Evil Village is the ability to upgrade your weapons, both with attachments found in the wild and upgrades bought from the game’s new merchant, an enigmatic figure known only as The Duke. Money is just as precious as healing items, providing a separate, economic puzzling of whether to cash out on bolstering your ammo reserves or saving up to make your pistol a little bit stronger or quicker on the reload. I also very much enjoyed the return of the inventory management system, a pseudo mini-game where guns, ammo, and other items have to be organized in your attaché case, even if it doesn’t have all that much bearing on the overall game.This all boils down to the chief conflict in the Resident Evil franchise (apart from, y’know, the monsters and stuff): making the most of a bad situation. So much of the ebb and flow of Resident Evil Village is the never-ending series of micro-choices that may have repercussions down the line. Ethan is constantly beset by danger, and it’s often up to you to decide which of the options presented to you is the least terrible. While it was rare for me to come up short on crafting materials to make ammo or healing items—thanks to an obsessive need to search everywhere before moving on with the story—there were late-game moments when I found myself anxiously relegated to using my sniper rifle in close combat. It was a kind of “whatever works” strategy that feels right at home in the crumbling, desperate world of Resident Evil and imparted me with some of Ethan’s own stress.While the game’s care to reference the enemy sieges and gunplay of Resident Evil 4 makes it a consistently tense experience, Resident Evil Village just plain isn’t scary most of the time, perhaps intentionally. Making progress early on is often a matter of entering dark, creaky buildings while monsters scuffle and growl just out of sight, but my arsenal of weaponry soon became so powerful that, on standard difficulty, serious threats were few and far between. Village’s boss battles felt similarly underwhelming, mostly acting as chapter-ending bullet sponges with very little in the way of scares or strategy. The only part of the game that really provided a fright was my visit to Donna Beneviento’s mansion—unfortunately, as I mentioned before, I’m not allowed to talk about that here. In fact, the last few action-heavy hours of the game are about as far away as you can get from the beginning’s attempts at survival horror. This escalation is a problem that even the modern era’s best Resident Evil games haven’t managed to solve, and it continues to be a disappointment whenever a new installment rolls around. The series never quite manages to stick the landing, its compelling openings writing checks that the conclusions ultimately can’t cash.Just a few years ago, Resident Evil 7 marked a return to the series’ survival horror roots, setting a high bar for its eventual follow-up. While Resident Evil Village still falls prey to the series’ most pernicious problems, notably the inevitable swerve from horror to action and bosses that don’t quite match the strong moment-to-moment gameplay, those shortcomings don’t overshadow the frequency with which the game hits on all cylinders. Village may not  live up to the potential of its immediate predecessor, but it’s a safe new entry in the series that induces the same entertaining anxiety as my favorite Resident Evil games and provides a few interesting wrinkles for where the franchise might go next.

Resident Evil Village reviewed on PS5. Also available on PC, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Stadia.Resident Evil Village is a direct sequel to Resident Evil 7, and as such, it has big shoes to fill. After the bestselling but poorly received Resident Evil 6 (and some terrible spin-offs), Resident Evil found itself in a rut. Fortunately, Resident Evil 7 tapped into the franchise’s roots and combined classic survival horror with modern gameplay to revitalize the series.Since the debut of RE7, Capcom has given us a bit of a mixed bag. Resident Evil 2 remake was one of the best games ever made, while Resident Evil 3 remake and the multiplayer Resident Evil: Resistance were met with a lukewarm reception. Where RE7 tapped into the original Resident Evil to revitalize the series, RE Village is channeling RE4. As such, it’s a faster-paced, more combat-oriented game with a much more expansive setting. The big question is whether or not that’s the best direction for the series. Resident Evil Village continues the story of Ethan and Mia Winters. Several years after the events in Dulvey Parish, Louisiana, the two have established new identities and a new life in Europe. They’ve even settled down enough to have a baby, Rose. Everything is looking up until Chris Redfield leads a raid on their home, shooting Mia and kidnapping Ethan and Rose.When Ethan awakens, he’s on the outskirts of a mysterious village, which he discovers is under siege by what seem to be werewolves. As he tries to find his daughter and figure out why Chris did what he did, Ethan becomes entangled in the machinations of the village’s leader and religious icon, Mother Miranda, and her “children,” the four heads of the local great houses: Lady Alcina Dimetrescu, Karl Heisenberg, Salvatore Moreau, and Donna Beneviento.With as much attention as Lady Dimetrescu received, she’s woefully underutilized, as are the rest of the antagonists other than the most boring one, Mother Miranda. The problem is that each of the four house leaders is relegated to its own territory, so each only gets a small bit of screen time.Instead of being a unified front, Ethan very methodically deals with each of the antagonists one at a time. Because of this, none of them are really given the room to develop as characters, which leaves them feeling very one-dimensional. Dimetrescu is big and angry; Heisenberg is a rebel and angry; Moreau is ugly, dumb, and angry; and Donna is asocial and angry. I never expected a total biographical flashback for each of them, but I did want to know their motivations beyond Mother Miranda’s wishes.RE Village’s plot is a lot more tenuous than its predecessor as well. By the time RE7 was over, you knew why the Bakers and Mia went insane, what happened in the three years Mia was gone, Eveline’s history, and who was behind it all. Despite the mold creatures being a bit lame, it was all explained in a way that at least tried to be scientific. I’m still not sure why some of the enemies in RE Village are Lycans, why some are just creepy hairless zombie-type things, or why Lady Dimitrescu is a vampire. There’s a very feeble attempt to explain it, but it’s thin.Threads pop in and out constantly. First, there’s a creepy cult around Mother Miranda, with a whole village of technology adverse people worshipping her. However, despite being a focal point of marketing, this concept is quickly pushed aside. Things are only explained as to how they fit in the moment, and as soon as they’re offscreen, they’re usually forgotten. The exception to this is Mother Miranda, who I found to be boring compared to her “children.” Her motivation is trite, and she’s one of the weakest antagonists of the series.The biggest problem is that the game tries to do too much in a short amount of time, so nothing has a chance to have much depth. I finished my first playthrough on Standard difficulty in a little under nine and a half hours, and I thoroughly explored each area, including the optional ones, read every file (except one), and scoured the map for items. Along the way, I constantly felt rushed. Sure there’s an impetus for Ethan to keep it moving since his daughter has been kidnapped, but the pacing never allows you to get too invested in any one aspect of the game.That’s not to say I didn’t enjoy the game. In fact, it’s the opposite. It could have used a few extra hours of game time to expand the story a bit and tie it back to the rest of the series more. As it is, outside of Chris Redfield’s presence and a few references, RE7 and RE Village feel more like their own separate series than part of a larger franchise.The game returns to the first-person perspective introduced in Resident Evil 7. Although I love the Resident Evil 2 remake, I think first-person is the way to go for the series from now on. Horror works best when it feels like it’s happening to you instead of an on-screen avatar, and getting behind the eyes of the protagonist enhances that for me.The combat is very similar to RE7, although the gunplay has been tightened up a bit (with the explanation that Ethan got some BSAA training after he and Mia were rescued). However, for whatever reason, he still can’t figure out gun sights. He’s got a normal hipfire, which is relatively accurate. However, unlike most games, when you press the “aim” button, Ethan just raises his firearm to shoulder level instead of looking down the sights. This makes no sense, especially considering one of the weapon upgrades you can find is a red-dot sight.There’s a wider variety of weapons this time around, including different variations of the handgun and shotgun. This brings in a bit of strategy as later models of these weapons start off more powerful, but cost more to upgrade. There’s not quite enough cash to fully upgrade each gun, so players have to be smart about where they’re spending their Lei.The inventory has been changed from item slots to the case system used in Resident Evil 4. However, unlike in RE4, the case never feels too crowded. I was able to carry four weapons, explosives, meat, and ammo, and only occasionally needed to rearrange my items. The case felt more like an homage than anything, which is fine. However, I would have liked to have seen more emphasis on inventory management, as having separate repositories for crafting items, key items, treasure, and then the case made it much too easy to keep a considerable stockpile.Also channeling RE4 is The Duke. This big boy appears to help point Ethan in the right direction and sell him arms and items to help him on his quest. The Duke also offers gunsmith services to upgrade weapons and, later on, will even cook for Ethan if you bring him ingredients (while taking his own portion, of course). I like the system and the character, but again, having a large man appearing in impossible locations throughout the game detracts from the immersion of the whole thing. The merchant in RE4 was fairly low key, but The Duke is larger than life (literally) and is an exemplar of the game’s strange tone.Resident Evil Village is a gorgeous game. Capcom has gone above and beyond with the environmental design, crafting a detailed and diverse world full of detail. I really can’t overstate just how good of a job the devs did here.The village itself is full of creaky old buildings that feel extremely lived-in. You can really picture generations of families being born, living, and dying in this ancient hamlet. Each home has a unique design that highlights the fact that they were all individually designed and constructed.In stark contrast to the humble village homes is Castle Dimitrescu. Its imposing cold stone hides an ostentatious interior reminiscent of Versailles. Much like its Lady, Castle Dimitrescu’s ornate halls hide sinister secrets, and the dank dungeons below are filled with failed experiments.Heisenberg’s factory and Moreau’s reservoir also serve to complement their masters. The factory, especially, serves as an excellent contrast to the rest of the game’s bygone locales. However, as much as I loved each individual location, the difference between them seemed too jarring at times. With each antagonist getting their own territory, the game can feel very much like a theme park.It’s a bit nonsensical walking through a humble village, which could, at the most, house a few hundred people, then visiting the factory, where Heisenberg is cranking out cybernetic monstrosities by the truckload. Style takes precedence over sense, which is acceptable for some works of horror, but not for one that bases its origins in “science.”Since the game has a fairly short playtime, none of the locales gets much of a chance to take center stage. Giving more backstory on each area and more opportunities for exploration would have gone a long way toward easing the theme park feeling. As it is, I felt rushed through each place and whisked away before I learned anything solid about their history.Thankfully, Resident Evil Village has a lot more staying power than Resident Evil 3 remake. Capcom’s last title was panned for its low replayability (for good reason). Village has the now-standard Extra Content Shop, which allows players to buy things like infinite ammo, concept art, models, and new weapons for story mode with points earned through in-game challenges.There are also multiple difficulty levels, but Hardcore and Village of Shadows (Very Hard) only raised enemy health, speed, and attack power and lowered the amount of ammo you get with each pickup. I would have liked to have seen something akin to RE7’s Madhouse mode with different item placement, as making Ethan softer and foes spongier isn’t that interesting.However, the return of The Mercenaries in Resident Evil Village is the big post-game draw here. In this game mode, players play through a series of levels and earn points by defeating enemies, gathering Lei, all set to a timer. The key to getting a big score is to combo enemies, collect the most cash possible, and hit the end goal with plenty of time remaining. After completing all the stages in an area, the player’s score is tallied, and they’re given a ranking from C to SSS.I’ve had a blast with The Mercenaries so far. Since you can buy weapons and items before and between each level, there’s a lot of experimentation required to find the best setup for each situation. Enemies spawn in the same place each time, so with each run, you get a little better at memorizing their placement and figuring out what combo of weapons works best.I struggled to get the A ranking needed to unlock consecutive stages, and I still haven’t figured out how to hit an S, SS, or SSS. I’m going to continue optimizing my route, and I’m excited to see how players perfect their runs. I hope that Capcom supports this mode with post-launch DLC, because it’s infinitely more interesting than RE:Verse.I went into Resident Evil Village with an open mind and came away with a decent game. There’s a lot of individual parts of it that I really, really like. The environmental design is fantastic, and I love each of the minor antagonists. The problem is that these things don’t quite mesh together. It’s still a spectacle, and I still thoroughly enjoyed my time with the game, but I don’t believe fans will remember it with the same fondness as RE7 and RE2 remake.I’ve been a fan of Resident Evil since I played the original RE2 when it was released in 1998. However, I’m not a purist. The increased emphasis on action isn’t Resident Evil Village’s issue. The problem is that it’s taken many elements and smooshed them together with little regard as to how they fit. If Capcom took a little more care with the game’s tone and its place in the series, it could have been a classic. As it is, RE Village is simply a good game with excellent production value.GameRevolution reviewed Resident Evil Village on PS5.

Destructoid,"darkHow did we get here?It feels like just yesterday that I rode to the store (RIP Power Video) to rent the original Resident Evil, which transported me to a magical haunted mansion for an entire weekend. From there Capcom slowly ramped up the action and ham to the utter point of excess in RE6. People couldn’t take it anymore! I think some of you drew the line at Wesker’s anime son punching zombies.Sure enough, Capcom got back to their roots with the spooky Resident Evil 7, and it paid off, big time, as it’s the most successful entry to date, and their overall second-best-selling game ever. Village brings back some of that lovely Christmas glazed ham and pairs it with the first-person horror of RE7. But mostly in a good way.Resident Evil Village (PC, PS4, PS5 [reviewed], Stadia, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S) Developer: Capcom Publisher: Capcom Released: May 7, 2021 MSRP: $59.99Like RE7, Village pulls a few unconventional storytelling tricks to let you know that it’s not your typical Resident Evil.The storybook intro (which has tonal throughputs that reverberate throughout the narrative) is lovely. The following scene is…without spoiling anything (it will be spoiled somewhere, as this was one of the few twists we could talk about in the review), is a little crazy and intense. Suffice to say, Ethan gets royally screwed yet again, but this time the stakes are a little higher, and the mystery is a little more enticing.That’s not to say it’s a “grand scale” per se. The “village” is actually a medium-sized region, complete with a towering castle and some adjacent waterways and a few other locations. It’s not a silly globe-hopping adventure like some entries, and it’s honestly not even as expansive as RE4, from an “amount of ground covered” standpoint. It’s a touch above intimate, which is a great middle ground for newer and older fans.It’s also a great marriage of camp and horror. There are shades of Resident Evil 7 lurking beneath the surface, as the mystery is fresh and new, but there are also giant vampire countesses; amid some extremely fan-servicey breadcrumbs that the previous entry didn’t quite dare to tread on. There’s at least two “what the hell” moments that will get people talking in some fashion (where are my RE lore nuts?).[brid video=”777347″ player=”12899″ title=”Resident%20Evil%20Village%20Review” duration=”302″ description=”Destructoid’s review of Resident Evil Village.We’re taking a trip out to the village of Resident Evil Village! AKA Resident Evil 8! Or do you prefer Roman numerals? Resident Evil VIII? Who cares! We’ve got tall vampires and first-person perspectives to talk about, so sit back and enjoy the video!” uploaddate=”2021-05-05″ thumbnailurl=”//cdn.brid.tv/live/partners/10260/thumb/777347_t_1620243694.jpg” contentUrl=”//cdn.brid.tv/live/partners/10260/sd/777347.mp4″]It doesn’t completely eschew the heightened horror feel either. It’s primarily an unsettling slower burn, with some jump scares thrown in for good measure. Similar to how I had to rip off the VR helmet with RE7 to catch a breather, I had to take off my PS5 headphones for RE8 a few times. The sound design, particularly the ambient noises like rattling and clanking, is top-notch.Speaking of, it doesn’t impact this review in any way, but I do miss the VR option! Looking up at ‘ol Annie in Vader Immortal was extremely cool, and the same could have been said for squaring up against Dimitrescu, the aforementioned vampire. I’m not just bringing up VR to wax nostalgia over RE7 though: the first-person style still works without it.The tension and sense of claustrophobia are still present, as are the memorable “hallway battles,” and plenty of open-air 360-degree fights. Particularly early on it does feel very guided/scripted, and many of the puzzles are extremely light fare and quite a few are optional. Depending on the area you’re in, it has that “spokes on a wheel” illusion of exploration; and the top item on my Village wishlist is for a few of those zones to be more expansive.A lot of Village could be annoying and gamey, but it isn’t. It’s just enough of a systems alteration to not piss people off. Crafting still feels extremely optional, only there if you want to double down on using a certain gun (with the power to create more ammo) or if you need a boost through a boss battle with a healing item. The shop is also an interesting mix of old and new school RE, providing upgrades like RE4 without going too overboard. You can even buy more inventory blocks to play storage Tetris with!It took me around eight hours to see the end, but like most RE games, it’s worth the replays, as you attempt to comb through all of the collectibles and secrets. There are four difficulty settings, as well as tons of little extras to play around with: the classic new shop with random goodies like infinite ammo toggles, new equipment, figures, and concept art. Then there’s Mercenaries. It’s back again!I’ll say this: although it’s not going to blow the doors off of any old school Mercenaries fan, I’m glad it’s in, at least. It’s a very arcadey diversion in the sense that you’re trying to rack up points, then either go for broke and clear out stages or head for the exit as soon as you hit a very clear “kill goal.” Time, combos (taking out enemies in succession), and a few other factors dictate your score, and you unlock new stages with an A rank or above (with bonuses doled out for other ranks).I wish it offered full multiplayer and was as elaborate as Raid Mode, but in any case, I view it as an extra, and I’m glad we didn’t just have to settle for whatever Re:Verse ends up becoming. Also, completing challenges in Mercenaries mode provides points to unlock stuff in the main mode, which is a nice little two-way street.I don’t think Resident Evil Village is going to be very divisive per se: I suspect the reaction will be generally positive. But it’s going to definitely spark some conversations as to how it stacks up against the current darling of RE7, and it has a long hill to climb to match its success financially. As for me, I think it complements it quite well, and then some.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]SuperbA hallmark of excellence. There may be flaws, but they are negligible and won't cause massive damage.

Shacknews,"New to Shacknews? Signup for a Free AccountAlready have an account? Login NowResident Evil Village walks a line of fear and action that reminds of a certain road we've been down before, but it's one worth traveling nonetheless.For as long as I have been playing the Resident Evil series, Resident Evil Village hit me in a certain way. Many will remember Resident Evil 4 as monumental shift for the franchise. I enjoyed RE4 thoroughly as well, but I couldn’t help looking at it as the pivotal point where the franchise began a noteworthy turn from survival horror into action. Years later, Resident Evil Village struck me oh so familiar to how Leon Kennedy’s own village and castle adventures played out so long ago. In a similar manner, Resident Evil Village’s journey doesn’t always work to the service of horror, but it does take working parts of previous titles and gives them a gorgeous coat of new paint nonetheless.Resident Evil Village finds us back in the role of Ethan Winters, moving the story forward three years after the events of the Baker Incident in RE7. Going off that game’s “good” ending, Ethan and his wife Mia relocated to Europe and had a child, their baby daughter Rosemary. It’s pretty clear they’re still shaken from the events that tortured them so mercilessly years before, but they try to make the best of it. Keyword is try. It isn’t long before their attempt at a regular family life is shattered by a hail of bullets and the abduction of their daughter. One rifle butt to the head, an unplanned nap, and a crashed military van later, Ethan finds himself stranded on the outskirts of a mysterious village without his wife and daughter.As should probably be expected, Resident Evil Village’s titular village is not doing okay. The whole town is dead and broken sans a few questionably lucky survivors. The cause? Some very fuzzy rabid humanoids with a penchant for feasting on unturned human flesh. Along the way, Ethan learns that his daughter is somehow in the village and the key to saving her lays with four supernaturally powerful figures and the even more powerful Lady Miranda who once offered protection to the village. Fans should already be well aware of one – the very popular and tall Lady Dimetrescu.Much like Dimetrescu and her often teased castle, the other “Lords” each preside over a unique domain near the village and Ethan is going to have to pay them all house calls if he means to save Rose. I will give fair warning without spoilers here: If you thought Dimetrescu was going to take up the lion’s share of your time in this game, realize that she’s just one of the Four Lords alongside Lady Miranda and temper your expectations accordingly. Don’t get me wrong, though, her entire presence in the game is a highlight. I’d actually argue every encounter with the Four Lords is pretty great.Resident Evil Village’s environments are quite varied and breathtaking. The village acts as a connecting hub at the heart of it all and each return to it peels back a little bit of the mysteries hidden within, but the four domains you’ll travel to are also equal parts gorgeous and harrowing. Each is filled to the brim with their own unique blend of action, traps, and monsters, as well as puzzles and secrets you’ll want to unravel if you’re going to gain the means you need to survive each oncoming challenge. The puzzles are passable, though nothing too outlandish or tricky - mostly bringing key items from point A to point B with a few decent exceptions.The visuals are really where the game shines. Lady Dimetrescu’s castle is a splendid array of lavish décor hiding a ghastly underbelly, whereas the walk to another Lord’s castle took us through a foggy path to a calm and eerie mountainside home near a stunningly beautiful waterfall. It was hard not to notice a little bit of texture pop-in at certain points in regular gameplay, but the places Village worked to direct my eyes to at any given point were often exhilarating, unnerving, drop-dead gorgeous, or some mix of those three elements.Let’s get right down to the nitty gritty of gameplay, which I think both does well in a certain light and is cause for concern in another. Most of Resident Evil Village controls as if Resident Evil 7’s POV and movement was blended with Resident Evil 4's action and trading mechanics. By that I mean this game throws creatures and intense situations at you like an unrepentant cyclone and it can feel overwhelming at first, but it also puts so many guns and bullets in simple curiosity’s reach that you can easily feel like you’re the scariest thing in the village.I kid you not, by hour three of the game I had a shotgun, a rifle, and a part upgrade for my pistol. By hour six I had already gotten some explosives and had the liberty of deciding what weapons I wanted to keep upgrading or sell. There are certain points in Village where it could easily be scary or unnerving if I wasn’t Ethan “Rambo’s scarier brother” Winters, armed to the teeth and ready to pulp any creature dumb enough to get in my face. After the exhilaration of fending off one particular pack of monsters, I even found myself audibly yelling out, “who wants to die next?” It’s a bit puzzling to me to feel that way in a Resident Evil game, though I can’t deny I enjoy the impact and variation of the weapons, their upgrades, and the gunplay.Similarly, aiding in that feeling is the presence of the Duke who appears throughout the game. This indulgent mystery man is well-acquainted with you, the village, and the mysteries abound for reasons he won’t reveal. More importantly, he hosts an ever-present shop of weapon upgrades, ammo, gun parts, and other provisions. His prices would be off-putting if Resident Evil Village wasn’t also packed to the gills with coin and treasures you can sell to him for even more coin. Much like Resident Evil 4 and 5, there are even special treasures that when sought out and combined will provide a healthy supply of arsenal-strengthening cash. Resident Evil 7’s crafting system even returns so you can collect a wealth of parts like green herbs, chemical fluid, and scrap to make med kits and bullets if ever you run out. All you have to do is be vigilant enough to find the pieces, which the game even helps you with by marking rooms and areas red if they still have items and blue if you’ve cleaned them out.Your growing array of weaponry and power aside, I will give Resident Evil Village this: Despite arming you relentlessly, the game still has enough threatening elements to make your initial exploration new section unnerving. There’s even sections of Village where it strips you of that power altogether and it easily provides some of the most disturbing parts in the game for a lot of reasons I won't spoil here. More importantly, Resident Evil Village treads a line where its environmental design can pancake you if you don’t look before you leap. I wish it was scarier throughout the whole adventure, but I won’t claim I ever felt invincible in the slightest.One thing I’m happy to share isn’t lacking here is post-game content. After what I would say is about a 10-to-12-hour adventure, those who found the Resident Evil 3 remake’s post-game underwhelming will likely take pleasure in how much there is to do after you finish the main game. For the production buffs, there’s a lot of behind-the-scenes movies, concept art, and character models with informational snippets about facets of the game’s design. For those looking for more to play, there are two harder difficulties past Standard, a multitude of unlockable special weapons and gear if you accomplish certain challenges in any playthrough, as well as The Mercenaries extra mode.The Mercenaries in particular has returned looking more engaging than usual. You choose a level like the village or the castle and clear monsters in a number of areas in the setting as fast as possible. Before each area you have the option to buy weapons and upgrades with a starting amount of money and whatever further cash you’ve collected in rounds. Then, after clearing each area, you get scored based on time you had left and money you collected or kept when you started the area. You can boost your score by racking up combos, slaying foes in short order, boosting your time per kill, and breaking yellow orbs for further time bonuses.There are also blue orbs that offer you a random set of three perks to choose from like bonus handgun damage or healing per kill. Do well enough and you can unlock new levels and even new perks to enter the rotation of possibilities at each blue orb. I really liked the additions to Mercenaries and feel it will be a great place for players to challenge themselves in a little time attack-style combat, and it does well to round out a wide array of post-game goods after RE3 remake was admittedly lacking.Resident Evil Village presents me with a conundrum I’ve felt all too often throughout certain eras of the franchise (particularly RE4): If I have the means to kill everything in my way at all times, why should I be scared? There are times it adequately answers this question and times where it does not. But that’s an ongoing issue with the balance of power in a supposed horror game. Perhaps more notably, I feel Resident Evil Village does great as an action game with solid horror elements. The combat is visceral and vibrant, the environments are splendid and mysterious, and the story had decent enough oomph to keep me involved throughout. I wish this was an overall scarier game, but it’s still a thrilling one nonetheless.This review is based on a PlayStation 5 digital copy supplied by the publisher.

					TJ Denzer posted a new article, Resident Evil Village review: I'm not trapped in here with you... 
					Resident Evil 8 is getting good reviews!! Hype!!https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-05-05-resident-evil-village-review-an-entertaining-if-uneven-slice-of-horrorEurogamer does say it's front half is better than its back half, just like RE7 was.Capcom hire me as the back half fixer for your RE games 				
					Just cut the back half lol.   In RE7 if the game literally just black-screened to credits right where you would traditionally load into that ship part the game would be massively improved.  Adding ""game designer"" to my resume.				
					I can't wait to see what the final level is. People seem to really hate it:https://twitter.com/cvxfreak/status/1389961600082202631 
					Doesn't even make his top 5 Res game?  There's only 8 :P  Unless he's counting all the spin-offs.  				
					And even then what spin-offs were actually better than the main numbered entries? 				
					I guess you could paint it like 1. Res 22. Res 43. Res 14. Res 75. Res 5 That would leave 6 and 3 being worse than 8 which almost seems like a given how badly those other 2 were panned and 8 would have to be pretty awful by comparison.   				
					what about RE0?  that counts as a mainline game right?				
					¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Maybe... I forgot there was a ""0"".  Was that on the Dreamcast?				
					GameCube and what about Code Veronica?				
					I always considered that a spin-off but I suppose it could be a main entry, idk.   Truth be told I've only played 1, 2, 5, and 7.  				
					Code Veronica should definitely count as a mainline game. And I'm not sure where your idea of RE3 being panned comes from.				
					Well maybe not panned but definitely seen as lesser than the ones on that top 5 list.  				
					There are plenty of survival horror fans that would rank it higher than anything that came after with the shift to more action in RE4.				
					Code Veronica was initially the ""real"" RE3, but something about a deal Sony and working on a spin-off,. they went ahead and named the ""spin-off"" aka RE3: Nemesis = RE3 and Code Veronica = ""Spin-off"" its confusing...				
					Also on pc now				
					Zero isn't a good game. And Code Veronica, while good in many ways, really needs a reworking.				
					It should, in the same vein that Yakuza 0 counts as mainline.				
					That's like the case for the entire franchise.  				
					There's always that turn where the scary shit turns to Umbrella Corp shit and yeah.				
					The reviews sound exactly like what I wanted to hear. More camp, more action, less horror. 				
					Given that they were said there were effectively merging RE4 + RE7, that's exactly what it sounds like.				
					Good because I can’t take too much scary stuff, I’m a wimp. 				
					Slightly bums me out because the raw horror in 7 is the most effective the series has ever been IMO, was hoping they'd go even harder on that aspect.  A nice Alien:Aliens relationship is pretty good too.  Game looks like fun for sure.				
					Shirif did you like 5 or 6 because those are what you described 				
					I didn't play either, even though I have 5 on PC. Maybe 30 minutes of 5, it was fun stuff4 was amazing though. 				
					Oh yeah, I tried 6's demo. It wasn't as horrible as people say. 				
					I hated 5 so much :(				
					:(. But there are plenty good RE games. Did you try 8's demo?				
					The first one where you're in the prison, I liked that part 				
					5 is legitimately good... in co-op. It's hard to get into if you're on your own.				
					Hmm yea I played soloIt just felt like a run of the mill third person shooter I want horror out of RE! 				
					It seems like they are going down the dark path of ruining the series on the path to Actionville excess again, haha! RE4 was awesome but it sure sealed REs fate until they revived it.				
					Good news for shirif is bad news for fans of RE.				
					Bummer, but I did enjoy 2-4 and 3 somewhat. 				
					Shirif, here’s another game to buy this month 				
					Yeah! 				
					This inspired me to play the demo on PC. No FOV slider and I got motion sick 5 minutes into playing it.  No Sale. 				
					""Less scary as you become more armed"" that's a pro in my book :)				
					Hasn't worked in the U.S.				
					long post in reply TL:DR:best audio options for Tempest 3D on PS5?				
					the audio options in this game are driving me fn nuts!! i cant even play because i cant decide if what i have setup is correct.. damnit.you've got.. 1. headphones2. headphones + virtual surround3. surround4. surround + virtual surround for headphones* and tempest 3d audio engine running on top all of it WHAT THE FUCK DO I PICK HERE?!?!  every single person online, and there's like 20 different threads on this, contradict each other with about every available option, so that helps none. Personally, using HEADPHONE + VIRTUAL SURROUND, on more than one occasion, due to hearing random noises, thinking it was something in my actual house.. i've had to, no shit, take my headphones off and listen to make sure it wasn't real life/in my house.(just random creaking, popping, subtle things sounded as if they were coming from my real life home and i had to actually take my headphones off and listen.) dunno if that means RE's built in VRR option is better than Sonys expensive hardware based 3d solution, if it works together or thats how you use the 3D audio, or what... but that's how its been.
