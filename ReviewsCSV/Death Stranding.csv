Link Official siteDeath Stranding is best when it shuts up. Being a game by Metal Gear Solid creator Hideo Kojima, it's naturally filled with bizarre characters, lengthy screeds of exposition, and indulgent cutscenes. But it's in the long, quiet stretches between all this, when it's just you hiking alone across a stark, haunting post-apocalyptic wilderness, where it really shines. In these moments, Death Stranding is quite unlike anything I've ever experienced in a game—or any other medium for that matter.That's not to say there's no value in the plot. When you're not being bombarded with mind-bending backstory, it's pretty interesting—and deeply weird. You are Sam Porter Bridges (played with a strange charisma by The Walking Dead's Norman Reedus), a courier delivering cargo across what's left of the United States. A supernatural cataclysm called the Death Stranding has driven the last of humanity into underground cities, leaving the barren, windswept surface plagued by soul-sucking ghosts called BTs, rain that rapidly ages anything it touches, and other strangeness.Watch our video review above.Your mission is to hike across North America, from the east coast to the west, connecting scattered settlements to the Chiral Network—a spiritual successor to the internet—as you go. Why Sam, though? He's a talented porter with a rep for getting things delivered on time. But, more importantly, he can detect BTs—which are otherwise invisible—with the help of a tiny, creepy baby strapped to his chest. One character insists these so-called Bridge Babies are merely equipment, not people, but Sam can't help but form a bond with the eerie infant. Oh, and Sam is immortal too, which makes him the perfect candidate for, as his superiors not-so-subtly put it, making America whole again.The majority of your time in Death Stranding is spent out in the open, plodding slowly from one place to another. The game is essentially a feature-length fetch quest. But the environment, and the many challenges it throws at you, makes these trips worth enduring. This curiously Scandinavian landscape is serenely beautiful, with a grand sense of scale and a bewitching atmosphere. As I trek across the continent I see enormous, cascading waterfalls, snowy mountains, steam-spewing volcanic fissures, raging rivers, dense forests, and wide, grassy plains—and it all looks, and sounds, stunning.I played Death Stranding on a PC with an RTX 2080 Super, an Intel Core i7-9700K, and 16GB of RAM, and it ran great at 4K/60fps—especially with DLSS 2.0 enabled. As for PC features, there's a set of Valve-themed side missions that unlock Half-Life cosmetics. As you'd expect, Death Stranding looks its best on PC, and solid performance, ultrawide support, and a new harder difficulty mode round the package off nicely.But it's not just for show. Death Stranding is secretly a brilliant hiking and mountaineering simulator, and every piece of rough terrain you encounter is a puzzle to be solved. If you rush things, Sam can trip, stagger, lose his balance, get swept away by powerful rivers, or slide down steep inclines—losing or damaging cargo in the process. This forces you to slow down and take a more thoughtful approach. Carefully plotting and picking your way across this rugged, unpredictable topography without dropping the precarious stack of packages balanced on your back is challenging and laborious, but also immensely rewarding.Some jobs seem impossible. Standing at the foot of a mountain, snow whipping at its peaks, fragile cargo stuck to every inch of your suit, you wonder how you'll ever get over it. But you power on, one step at a time, patiently placing ladders and climbing ropes, edging closer to your destination. Along the way you might have to slip into Metal Gear mode and sneak past BTs, or deal with extreme weather such as disorientating blizzards. You might even get knocked out by terrorists and have your cargo stolen, forcing you to sneak into their camp and take it back. But after all that, you make it, and it feels incredible.If this sounds like a lot of hard work, well, it is. But one of my favourite things about Death Stranding is how it drip-feeds you new gadgets and tools to gradually make things easier. As you progress through the story you unlock an almost overwhelming array of kit, including power gloves for faster climbing, BT-killing blood grenades (don't ask), and mechanical exo-skeletons that let you handle more weight, tackle tougher terrain, or run faster. You even get access to vehicles, including an electric trike. However, you can only carry so much stuff at once, so there's a nice strategic element to deciding which gear to take or leave before you embark on a long delivery.But you're never alone out there. Death Stranding's most overt theme is connection, and this manifests itself in some brilliantly clever asynchronous multiplayer. As players traverse their world, dropping ladders and ropes, or using a device called a PCC to build river-spanning bridges, battery-boosting generators, ziplines, roads, and other helpful objects, these then appear in other people's games. You see traces of other porters everywhere you go, and there's something wonderful about struggling up a mountain, only to spot a rope left by a fellow traveller, which then spares you a chunk of climbing. And you can show your appreciation with likes, a kind of social XP.Sneaking through terrorist camps, the DNA of Metal Gear Solid is strongly feltYou unlock weapons later in the game, both lethal and non-lethal, but I was impressed by how I was able to play the bulk of Death Stranding without using them at all—outside of a few unavoidable set-pieces. There are dozens of ways to deal with BTs and terrorists, but there's always the option to just avoid them. Sneaking through terrorist camps, the DNA of Metal Gear Solid is strongly felt. The character movement, and how the weapons feel, is also similar to MGSV. But otherwise this is a completely different game, with surprising scope for non-violence.Disappointingly, story is Death Stranding's weak link. The broad strokes are great, and Sam's mission to connect a fragmented civilisation is an effective hook. But so much of the finer details are told in uninteresting ways, whether it's through lengthy, overwrought cutscenes, overlong text-heavy emails, or rambling radio chatter. The mythology is a baffling soup of nouns, and I found the characters hard to love, despite the extraordinary realism of their tear-strewn faces. The cast is great, though. Mads Mikkelsen is an engaging and charismatic villain, and there's a compelling otherworldliness to Léa Seydoux's performance as fellow courier Fragile.Thankfully, most of the game is spent out in the field, delivering packages, and battling the elements. But a parade of seemingly never-ending cinematics towards the end really tested my patience—and this is coming from a Kojima fan. That said, there are plenty of memorable set-pieces and moments. The frequent use of songs by Low Roar, an American-Icelandic post-rock project by musician Ryan Karazija, is tastefully done. These haunting, ethereal pieces of music often play over the final stretch of a long journey, with the camera pulling back to reveal more of the landscape. And even when the story is tripping over itself, Death Stranding is always a captivating thing to just look at.The cutscenes, as long and self-indulgent as they are, feature some really imaginative, trippy imagery, and it's rare to see something this offbeat and surreal created with a budget usually reserved for a high-end blockbuster action game. The mechanical design, led by longtime Kojima collaborator Yoji Shinkawa, is consistently impressive too. Sam's gear, the vehicles he drives, and the structures he builds all have a distinctive, idiosyncratic high-tech aesthetic. This is a lavish game in every respect, which playing on a high-end PC in 4K really hammers home. This is undoubtedly the best version.I can see why Death Stranding is such a divisive game, but every misgiving I have about it is ultimately snuffed out by the magnificence of hiking across that sweeping, rugged wilderness. It's an unbelievably slow game with an almost comical amount of backtracking, especially towards the end. Yet, somehow, it kept me interested all the way through. Granted, a ponderous, pensive delivery simulator will be a hard sell for a lot of people. But if you value games that defy genre, reward patience, and aren't afraid to get weird, Death Stranding is a wild ride worth taking, even if it stumbles along the way.Slow, weird, and indulgent, but a true original, and a journey that will linger in your mind long after it's over.If it’s set in space, Andy will probably write about it.

Eurogamer,"Walkin' man blues.Small wonder that Sony moved to snap up console-exclusive rights to Hideo Kojima's first game after his acrimonious split with Konami. Kojima and PlayStation have a close relationship that dates back to Metal Gear Solid's debut in 1998. Beyond that, Sony's commissioners have a helpless weakness for the most ambitious and bizarre visions of video gaming's great auteurs and obsessives. If you are a Fumito Ueda, or a David Cage, or a Kazunori Yamauchi, and you have a weird idea for a game that cannot possibly be made on budget and will confuse the hell out of the marketing department, then Sony has a few million dollars with your name on them.Well, Kojima has delivered. On time, surprisingly, but also 100 per cent on brand. The first release from his new studio Kojima Productions and his first non-Metal Gear game since 2003's Boktai, Death Stranding is nothing if not an event. It is at once unmistakable as his work and surpassingly strange. It is grandiose and goofy, liberating and frustrating, thrilling and audaciously dull. It boldly strikes out for new territory even as it gets bogged in the mire of convention. Its preoccupations are nakedly displayed while its plot is borderline incoherent. It's hilariously indulgent of its creator; the production could certainly have used more people who were willing to tell Kojima no. Although perhaps we can be glad they weren't around. If they had been, Death Stranding would be more like other games, and that would be a shame.Mystification at Death Stranding's content and storyline, which has persisted since it was announced, doesn't really end when you start playing it. It turns out the PR wasn't being deliberately enigmatic - it just is that weird. It really is a game about delivering packages in a desolate future where the veil between death and life has been torn. After a catastrophic event known as the death stranding, America is a dangerous wasteland stalked by reckless bandits and frightening apparitions known as BTs. Rain accelerates the passage of time for anything it touches. Understandably, most people live underground. As Sam Porter Bridges - a stolid deliveryman, played by Norman Reedus - you must reconnect a fragmented society by bringing bunker-like waystations, outposts and cities onto the ""chiral network"", a kind of ectoplasmic internet.There's more to it than that, of course. A lot more. This might be Kojima's first time in 15 years working on a blank sheet of paper, but that hasn't held back the tide of lore that engulfed the Metal Gear series - especially in its premature swansong, Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots. He remains instinctively arcane, building Death Stranding's script (he is credited, among other things, as creator, producer and writer) and its world out of acronyms, jargon, portentous nicknames, secret histories, hazy philosophising and oddball, comic-book characters.So Sam is also on a quest to rescue his sister, Amelie (a digitally rejuvenated Lindsay Wagner), from a terrorist known as Higgs (Troy Baker). He is sent on this quest by his mother, President Bridget (also Lindsay Wagner). He works for Bridges, which seems to be a sort of federal corporation in the mould of Amazon and is run by a masked character called, if you can believe it, Die-Hardman (Tommie Earl Jenkins). He is visited by a mysterious woman in a rubber suit with a spiky umbrella called Fragile (Léa Seydoux). He chats, via a Metal Gear-style codec, to a team of Bridges boffins: Deadman (Guillermo del Toro), Heartman (Nicolas Winding Refn) and Mama (Margaret Qualley). And there are visions of a mysterious man, played by Mads Mikkelsen, who seems to be connected to his BB.This BB is an unborn baby that Sam carries around on his chest in a tiny sarcophagus. It helps him establish a connection to the world of the dead, which is called the Beach, because... well, because it's a beach. This allows him to perceive the BTs, or Beached Things, more easily. Sam has a condition called DOOMS, which is never very well explained, and is also a ""repatriate"", which means he can come back from death. Any other human that dies must be instantly cremated or risk creating a ""voidout"" when their body is seized by the BTs, blowing a crater in the map. In this world, killing people really isn't advisable.It's an odd universe, laden with symbolism: bridges, ropes, hands, babies, umbilical cords and the signifiers of death are everywhere. If it has an eerie power - and it definitely does - it is not thanks to the heavy-handed thematic treatment or the clumsy writing. Seldom has a game worked so hard to explain itself only to fail. The actors spend most of their time valiantly wading through a tar pit of exposition that somehow does little to advance your understanding or flesh out their strikingly designed characters. (In fact, this game is so obsessed with exposition that it continues through, and then past, the end credits. The entire hours-long final act of the game is so overblown, it's a scarcely believable display of hubris.)Credit where it's due to the cast: Qualley adds a much-needed note of relatable humanity; Seydoux does her best with a faintly icky characterisation. Reedus does the gruff everyman thing well enough and his compact physicality really grounds Sam as an avatar. Del Toro, the acclaimed Mexican film director and connoisseur of pop-culture weirdness, seems to be having the most fun with this nonsense, and is a lively presence throughout. Kojima continues to have an awkward relationship with his female characters, who are objectified or mythologised in uncomfortable ways: mothers, sisters, soulmates and tragic ghosts, often muddled together. It's fair to say that the men are hardly more than ciphers, either.Where does Death Stranding get its strange power from, then? Why will it linger in the memory long after the 50 hours or so (not counting sidequests) you spend playing it? At this point, it's worth puncturing the image of Kojima as gaming's supreme auteur to remind yourself that he has had a vital collaborator on almost every one of his games: the artist Yoji Shinkawa. Together, Kojima and Shinkawa have created indelible characters and crafted a signature look: a kind of muscular, sinuous, faintly sinister futurism, powered by robotics and haunted by the bomb. Death Stranding, on which Shinkawa served as art director, weaves in a new strand of ghostly horror, and is perhaps their most potent creation yet.It cuts Metal Gear's ties with the real world; although nominally set maybe 100 years in the future, Death Stranding feels as if it exists much farther off. It's a distant, bleak fantasy of humanity drifting toward oblivion. The landscapes are stark, melancholy, empty. Hard, clean materials streak with rust in the ""timefall"". The technology is skeletal: one particularly memorable creation, brilliantly animated, is the Ordradek, a flower-like scanning arm that sits on Sam's shoulder, pulsing, spinning and pointing to indicate the presence of BTs. The BTs themselves are genuinely haunting. They manifest, variously, as sudden handprints in black mud; floating, smoky figures tethered by winding umbilical chords; grasping torsos emerging from puddles of tar; and ghastly, thrashing, monstrous fish.Sam trudges across this unsettling, beautiful space, bringing packages from one place to another. That really is the substance of Death Stranding: fetch quests. It could almost be a parody of rote open-world game design, but it turns out that Kojima Productions is deadly serious about it. It wants the simple act of navigating this world, from A to B, to be challenging and evocative. It is. Sam must carry his load on his back, stacked high, and he must bring the equipment he needs with him, too: weaponry, ladders, climbing ropes, supplies, spare boots in case his wear out. He has finite stamina and endurance reserves, and you need to think about weight distribution and balance. The landscape is rugged, so you need to plot your routes carefully, pulling the controller's triggers to keep Sam on an even keel. Climbing is hard, but descending is more dangerous still, and if you topple your cargo may be damaged.It is steady, hypnotic stuff. Some may find it boring. I enjoy hiking myself and found it startlingly true-to-life to pick my way through the rocky outcrops, footfall by footfall. The maps encourage this, being convincingly organic, meticulously designed and completely open. I liked the game best when I planned a circuitous route for a delivery and was rewarded with a long, lonely walk through silent, beautiful views; or when I figured out that I could shortcut a very long delivery by taking a risky, gruelling trek through a high mountain pass. The loop is one of careful preparation - selecting your equipment, optimising your load, planning your route - followed by the journey. It's fair to say that it can be pretty dry, and the micromanagement can be onerous. But at its rigorous best, Death Stranding reframes your relationship with an open-world landscape in much the same way that The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild did.For both better and worse, that's not all there is to it. There are vehicles - bikes and trucks - though they're not always well suited to the landscape. There is combat with human bandits, which is a blend of stealth and scrappy, panicky combat familiar from Metal Gear. There are BT encounters, which are wonderfully creepy and suspenseful at first, as you try to crawl past the ghouls without being detected, but aggravating and strangely pointless when you are caught and must face one of the larger apparitions, which can be fought or fled from. There are some boss battles, though none to match the classic, theatrical encounters Kojima has staged in the past. As in Metal Gear, there is an abundance of overdeveloped, underused gadgetry and systems. As in Metal Gear, there is a satisfyingly exacting way to play, but you are just as likely to blunder or brute force your way through. DF's John Linneman loved his time with Death Stranding and reckons it's ""a unique, stunning vision powered by state-of-the-art technology"". Check out his video above, or read the full tech report for John's analysis (and superior screenshots).Here's another contradiction for you: it is a very lonely game, but you are never alone. Death Stranding takes Dark Souls' idea that other players can leave messages in your game and expands upon it. Once you have connected an area to the chiral network, you can see messages and use equipment players have left behind, entrust deliveries to them or pick them up, and collaborate with them on building useful infrastructure like roads, safe houses and shelters. Sometimes this kills the mood a little, but more often than not it's a life saver, and there's nothing more pleasing than creating a particularly useful structure and having it go viral. Other players reward you with Likes, which you also earn from making your deliveries and other in-game actions, and which seem to be the most prized currency in this world. They are Death Stranding's equivalent of experience points and feed into a fuzzily defined character progression system.Both the Likes and Sam's job - a kind of heroic, public-service version of a gig-economy courier - have a deliberately mundane and contemporary resonance in this otherwise otherworldly setting. I think it's deliberate, anyway, and Kojima does have something to say about how we are engineering ourselves into a state of busy isolation (though some might question his thesis that the best way to bring people together is by expanding network coverage). The commentary is earnest, if a little on the nose. Sadly, it gets lost in a froth of stoned-undergrad-grade existential waffle towards the end of the game, as Kojima strains unsuccessfully to make something meaningful of his nonsensical story and garbled lore.As the credits roll on Death Stranding, heavy with unearned pathos, the impression you're left with is of a self-congratulatory monument to the ego of a creator who is high on his own supply. Has Kojima always been this full of it? Maybe. But then you return to the game proper, select a humble delivery order, lace up your boots and plan another reckoning with those unforgettable, haunted moors. And you realise that this game has got under your skin in a way few do.

Metro GameCentral,"Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima brings his first game as an independent developer to PC and it is exactly as strange as you’d expect.The problem with Death Stranding isn’t explaining what it’s all about but trying to make it sound interesting. The game is filled to bursting with all the weird ideas, in terms of both gameplay and plot, that Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima can muster, and yet at the end of the day it’s about delivering parcels over rocky terrain and making sure you don’t fall over. We’d say there’s a lot more to it than that but in gameplay terms there really isn’t, and yet it’s all somehow far more engaging that it sounds.Despite the landscape clearly being that of Iceland (an incongruity that we don’t think Kojima has ever explained), Death Stranding is set in a post-apocalyptic America where the worlds of the living and dead have crossed over and wiped out most of the country’s population. All that survives now are small, isolated communities and it’s your job to connect them up to an Internet equivalent called the Chiral Network. And deliver the post while you’re at it.You do run into the occasional bandit, but the main danger are BTs (beached things) – normally invisible otherworldly creatures that for most of the time you are best to avoid rather than attempt to fight. This leads to some light stealth elements but Death Stranding is by no means an action game and the main gameplay element is simply exploring the game world and trying to keep your balance, given you’re usually weighed down by an absurd number of very heavy boxes. It sounds less interesting the more you describe but it’s actually a surprisingly engrossing video game.Although things do go overboard in the final hours – as plot points are overexplained over and over again – for most of the game the storytelling is surprisingly reserved for Kojima and the melancholy atmosphere is allowed to stew, as you explore the desolate landscape and meditate on the game’s themes of human mortality and isolation in a post-Internet society. Themes which, by coincidence, are now more relevant than ever thanks to the coronavirus, where many will find themselves sympathising very much with the game’s locked-in inhabitants meekly waiting for the postman to brighten their day.The other surprising element of the game is how much the online features add to the experience. You never meet other players directly, but you do get to see in-game items they build, such as shelters and fast travel locations, and optionally help to upgrade them and share resources. It’s another aspect that, on paper, doesn’t seem like it would amount to much but helps to give a sense of community while keeping in-line with the game’s own sensibilities.I beat Spider-Man 2 in 14 hours and I want my money back - Reader’s FeatureOnly 1% of Netflix users are taking advantage of a free little-known perkAlan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepIn terms of the PC version, the only new content is a photo mode and a promotion with Valve for gravity gloves and a head crab outfit. But this is a solid port with support for 4K and an unlocked frame rate up to 240fps. There’s no ray-tracing, and not the widest range of graphical options imaginable, but you’ve got a choice of anti-aliasing technologies, ambient occlusion, and motion blur.Death Stranding is not a game for everyone, that much was obvious the moment it was announced, but while it’s filled with odd design decisions and narrative choices its many conflicting parts operate with surprising synergy. How Hideo Kojima managed to convince people to give him the money to make such an idiosyncratic big budget game we don’t know but that’s not the only thing that’s interesting about Death Stranding, which stands up as a compelling game in its own right.CLICK HERE FOR THE ORIGINAL FULL REVIEW OF DEATH STRANDINGIn Short: The coronavirus has made its themes more relevant than ever and while there are many odd decisions, in terms of plot and game design, the overall experience remains strangely engrossing.Pros: Large game world filled with detail and mystery, that works in conjunction with a bizarre storyline that somehow manages to be unexpectedly insightful. Great graphics and a good PC port.Cons: There’s no getting away from the fact that the basic gameplay loop is very repetitive and often quite dull. Narrative becomes increasingly intrusive, and nonsensical, in the final hours.Score: 7/10Formats: PC (reviewed) and PlayStation 4Price: £54.99Publisher: 505 GamesDeveloper: Kojima ProductionsRelease Date: 14th July 2020Age Rating: 18Email gamecentral@metro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter.

Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy.After all the conspiracy theories, conjecture and just plain hype, Death Stranding turns out to be about carrying boxes from A to B. And, often, back again. That’s it. That’s the game. This is going to be a spoiler free review in terms of story, but mechanically it’s hard to talk about anything without making it clear: you carry boxes around pretty much the entire time. Sometimes you fall over, occasionally ghosts appear and get in the way, but otherwise almost the entirety of your time involves staggering over uneven terrain carrying a backpack loaded to spine-rupturing levels with anything from underpants to medical supplies. The idea is that ‘the Death Stranding’, a cataclysmic past apocalyptic event, has reduced the world to little more than walled cities and bunkered survivors, known as preppers. The outside world is a rocky hellscape filled with ageing Timefall rain showers and Beached Things, or BTs – spirits of the dead unable to pass on, and now drifting the wasteland fatally seeking out the living. Even now, after some 70-odd hours of playing, it still sounds exciting, and the first time you encounter these ethereal spectres, tethered to the world by a ghostly umbilical cord, there are shivers. At the front end there’s an exciting prospect laid out in front of you: it looks incredible, with a beautiful landscape you can endlessly drink in, and some incredible facial capture (one late scene contains some of the best in-game performance I’ve ever seen, that’s almost impossible to distinguish from someone just being filmed). The world, the idea, and the promise looms large. And so you set off, carrying your boxes full of stuff to wherever you’re meant to go. And you carry, and you carry. Sometimes you fall over. Sometimes you creep through fields of somnolent, shadowy wraiths, sometimes you get a moment of contemplative isolation over an amazing vista. Sometimes you fall over again. But as you deliver, and deliver, you start to realise that the mechanic of carrying things is almost the only way you can reach in and touch the world. In the same way that a shooter only really lets you interact with a game’s world through shooting things, Death Stranding principal form of interface is transportation. It’s not a bad idea per se – there’s a contemplative element to loading up, choosing your gear and then setting out – but it’s basically all you do and there’s only so long that idea can be interesting. It’s a gameplay language with little vocabulary, so the experience struggles to express itself in any deep and meaningful way. Your cargo might be very fragile, or explosive, as a variation, or the ground might be extra rocky… but that’s about it. In the later stages of the story, when the stakes are raised, the only way Death Stranding’s gameplay can really express any sense of tension is by asking you to walk incredible distances or, in several ‘oh Jesus, really?!’ moments, ask you to walk back, or further, on completion. (There’s is eventually a fast travel system, but it only transports ‘you’ and no cargo.) There are moments of variation – some more traditional third person combat (again, seen in trailers) – but these are tangential, fleeting moments that feel like an addendum. Arguably show stopping moments but not really substantial enough to have any real impact. Even in these moments of direct conflict however there’s almost no real threat, and generally the worst that happens is damaging a package so much you fail the mission. There are a scattering of human enemies called Mules who, for reasons, are addicted to stealing cargo. They’re easy to Square button thump into submission though, even before you unlock any weapons, and even easier to avoid. Even the BTs, the poster monsters for the whole thing, aren’t particularly dangerous. They’ve easy to avoid, and even if you do get ‘caught’ - triggering a one-on-one boss battle with a giant BT monster - it’s easy to defeat the creature or just run away. (Often it’s almost a viable tactic to get caught on purpose to clear the area as winning the boss fight gets rid of everyone.)""There’s almost no real threat, and generally the worst that happens is damaging a package so much you fail the mission""The lack of risk contributes to making it all feel a bit like a chore. There are always multiple deliveries on offer, leaving you juggling an eternal dilemma: do you pick it all up at once and be comically overloaded, your goods towering above as your knees buckle, risking falls that can dent your completion score, or fail you outright? Or do you take one thing at a time – a safer option that’ll have you backtracking endlessly back and forth one box at a time? It’s basically ‘Overencumbrance: The Game’. The essential gear you need – things like ladders and climbing ropes, healing Blood Bags and canister repair sprays to negate Timefall rain damage – all occupy the same boxed units as cargo that stack up on your back and body to the point that even a light loadout can quickly pile everything on. With more weight your stamina falls faster, you’re more likely to fall, and there’s more risk you can lose something along the way. The game provides tools to help: things like exo-skeletons, floating trolleys and vehicles but it often feels like for every solution there’s a problem. When you eventually unlock the basic starter bike vehicle, and later trucks, it’s in a location so rocky and uneven it’s almost impossible to drive anywhere, as you clang and catch on rocks. Plus, batteries can run out and wheels can get stuck, so you take a risk loading up anything with more than you can carry alone should machines fail. Which, much of the time, pushes you back to being on foot, which is a frustratingly inconsistent experience. Stamina, footing, speed and ground angle all contribute to an animation system that can have you wrestling with the sticks and shoulder bracing buttons to stay upright should you trip. Your stability improves as you level up stats, and unlock better gear, but there’s always the lingering fear that the slightest movement could randomly result in anything from a skipped step to a full-sprint face-planting fall. It seems oddly scripted at times: I found catastrophic, can’t-stop-it tumbles far more likely to happen near ravine and cliff edges where I was, ironically, being so, so careful. There’s one other thing that also makes life easier, and that’s everyone else playing the game. There’s a wonderfully inventive asymmetrical online element that sees items and constructions from other players appear in your world and vice versa. The ladders and ropes you leave around on your travels appear for other people in their game. You can build bridges and roads, or contribute resources to other people’s, with the landscape slowly becoming more traversable as this equipment and structures appear, bearing the name of whoever originally built it and showing the ‘likes’ its received (one is automatically given whenever you use something, and you can add more with a button press or three). It’s a fantastic idea; a lovely expression of strangers pulling together against an inhospitable world, adding moments of solidarity in an otherwise bleakly isolating world. The space where this system first comes into play is full of youthful enthusiasm, sprinkled with charging stations, roads, bridges and more as players test it all out. The further you get (both physically and in terms of time) progress slows and things are spaced out with a more weathered and functional minimalism. When the story moves to more mountainous routes, ziplines pop from peak to peak, becoming a literal game changer. Throughout, the idea holds up well as players collectively shape and inform the world through their actions, routes evolving over time. Someone’s bridge might become a crucial landmark, or let you negate some terrible, rough terrain. Your space becomes signposted and defined by the player tags attached to the things around you. You start to recognise these unseen faces as you repeatedly run into their traces. The names have meaning, so when you find items of lost cargo flagged with a friendly face you can return it for extra likes and the chance to pay it forward. It’s a game you play alone, but in a world you share. The whole game riffs on this idea of connection. As mentioned already in the trailers (the only story stuff I’ll bring up) you play as Norman Reedus’ Sam Porter Bridges, tasked with saving the world through the medium of delivering stuff. You’re basically an apocalyptic Amazon Courier reconnecting a shattered America, location by location, to the Chiral Network, a sort of metaphysical AT&T that enables communication, as well as 3D printing of all your gear. You can’t see or access player structures until an area’s connected, or fabricate the gear you need to push on either, so making these deliveries is essential if you want to… make more deliveries.Obviously this is a Hideo Kojima game, which I’ve stayed away from until now in an attempt to discuss the game on its merits alone, without everything that name brings with it. It’s a name that obviously conjures up huge expectations and Death Stranding doesn’t entirely deliver on them. I can’t explain why in too much detail without spoilers but there are no real ‘holy shit’ moments, no surprises, just an okay-ish game about carrying boxes at the end of the world. The story is fine: high fantasy sci-fi full of Kojima’s trademark lengthy cutscenes, most of which involve characters explaining the story with broad swathes of exposition that doesn't so much break the ‘show don’t tell’ rule as pound it into submission with line after line of careful rationaled explanation. There’s a lot of symbolism and metaphor spread thickly all over all of the story and characters, and some of it is incredibly literal – Mama is a mother, Heartman’s heart stops every 21 minutes, etc – some of it is nonsense. And plenty of it seems to exist just to provide the possibility for people to attach meaning to – like multiple slices of toast that may or may not contain the face of Jesus. At least a handful of critical plot points and elements seem to defy explanation or logic utterly, beyond a ‘ta-da!’ curtain reveal.Death Stranding does have its moments though, despite the overall monotony of its principal activity. The groundbreaking visuals create a beautiful world, and there’s an incredible atmosphere when you reach a great view, or take a moment bathe in the glory of the snow crusted mountain you’ve just scaled. When the setting, progress and music combine it is a mood. If nothing else I’m a Low Roar fan now having played 70 odd hours of possibly the most expensive interactive music video ever made. Progress is key to really enjoying it. I hit around 30 hours at the Chapter 3 mark, before I discovered I was barely a quarter of the way through and made the conscious decision to focus more on the story. Doing so gives everything more impact and meaning by bringing the cutscenes and story closer together, and adds more variety to what limited texture with a quicker progression of new locations, equipment and other things. You can spend days if not weeks making side-deliveries to a cameo heavy cast of survivors and gain little from it bar a deafening gulf between narrative beats that leaves fragmented isolated moments devoid of all connecting momentum. There is an okay experience here, filled with a scrapbooking hokum of afterlife mythology and pseudoscience, with a cast of likeable if bluntly literal characters but it’s a game that, ironically, is easily lost in its lengthy delivery. I'm GamesRadar's Senior Guides Co-ordinator, which means I run GamesRadar's guides and tips content.

Metro GameCentral,"The creator of Metal Gear Solid delivers a PS4 exclusive as only Hideo Kojima could, but how does Death Stranding compare to his other classics?Death Stranding involves a lot of explaining. The first thing anyone asks is ‘What is it about?’ and ‘What do you do?’ and yet for the longest time the game itself struggles to answer those questions, with extended bouts of exposition and tutorial tips that are still being generated several hours after you’ve first started. And yet at its heart the game, and even its story, is fairly straightforward. Or at least as straightforward as anything from Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima ever gets.One problem with Death Stranding is that as soon as anyone starts to describe the game it instantly begins to seem less interesting than you imagined. In part that’s because it combines two of gaming’s most controversial concepts into one: the walking simulator and fetch quests. Whether Kojima did this on purpose, as some sort of meta level irony, is, as with many of his design decisions, difficult to tell. But what we can say is that the Death Stranding is the most entertaining postal delivery simulator we’ve ever played.The setting for the game is post-apocalyptic America, where a ‘Death Stranding’ (imagery of cetacean stranding is rife throughout the game) has occurred, which has linked the living world with the land of the dead. This has caused several problems, not least that the body of anyone who dies turns into an anti-matter time bomb, which has already caused the destruction of most major cities. On top of that, when it rains the water rapidly ages anything it touches and invisible creatures called BTs (beached things) stalk the land and actively hunt the living.Exactly how many people are left in the world is never made clear. In fact, a lot of the back story remains peculiarly vague for the entire game, with no other country other than America ever mentioned. And even though the time frame only seems to be the near future what’s left of mankind has somehow mastered instant 3D printing using a substance called chiralium, which is left behind by BTs. That in turn has led to the creation of an organisation called Bridges which has set up new cities across the country and is trying to establish an Internet equivalent called the Chiral Network.Although getting the Chiral Network up and running across the whole US is one of the main goals of the game Bridges is not well trusted by the populace. The US government is all but defunct and instead everyone, somewhat strangely, places more confidence in couriers; or porters as they’re called in the game. (Why they don’t just use flying drones, which we already have today, is handwaved away by a throwaway line.) That’s where you come in, as you play Sam Bridges – a surly loner who also happens to be the son of the last President of the United States and brother to the would-be successor.Sam’s sister is kidnapped by terrorists just before the game begins and rescuing her from the westernmost city is how he’s finally convinced to help set up the Chiral Network, by visiting outposts and linking each one up with a set of magic/high-tech dog tags. Why everything is ready to work except for that and nobody else managed to turn it on beforehand is not something the plot addresses, we assume because that’s not what Kojima is interested in. What he is interested in though is using it as a very literal example of connecting people… after you perform a fetch quest or two for them.In terms of gameplay Death Stranding features very little traditional action and only a modicum of stealth. At first you can only avoid BTs, after you’re given a BB (bridge baby) which is a newborn child in a jar born to a brain-dead mother and which is aligned to neither the world of the living or dead. Your particular BB has a major impact on the story but its gameplay purpose is to make BTs partially visible. There’s really only one type of BT, plus boss type creatures if you get caught by them, but as you’d expect from the creator of Metal Gear the stealth action works very well and is impressively tense.The third person gunplay is also a lot of fun, but it comes up much less often. There’s also the problem that you can’t afford to kill anyone because their corpse will take out the whole area. That’s actually a very clever way to try and make a non-violent action game but Kojima seems curiously indifferent to the potential and the implications are not something the story dwells on. There’s lots of airy talk about connecting people but the fact that you don’t dare kill anyone is barely even mentioned, which seems a huge missed opportunity in terms of matching gameplay with narrative.Rather than stealth or combat the main gameplay focus is simply delivering parcels. Each new outpost you visit will want something collected or delivered and once you’ve done that they’ll agree to join the Chiral Network and you can move on. Making your delivery might involve a run in with BTs or bandits but not necessarily, and so the only consistent obstacle to your progress becomes the terrain itself.Peculiarly, the geography looks nothing like the real US, unless there are vast swathes of the country that are covered in glacial boulders and basalt columns that we’re unaware of. Obviously, there are some – it’s a big country – but almost every square metre of the game map is covered in boulders that make traversal, especially by vehicles, very difficult.The large open world map, split into two separate areas, is highly reminiscent of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild but despite being such a large focus the traversal in Death Stranding is not as intrinsically entertaining. Sam cannot climb vertically for any distance without a rope and so either has to use a giant extendable ladder or just find a way around.The other gameplay difficulty is that as a porter you use yourself as essentially a pack horse, attaching huge boxes to every part of your body until you’re absurdly overburdened. You can still move around fairly easily though; you just have to lean into it and correct your balance using the trigger buttons. As a result, balancing your load so you’re not top heavy becomes vitally importantly, although thankfully there is an auto arrange button to help.And that, pretty much, is Death Stranding.If you’re thinking all this sounds a little dull, you’re not entirely wrong. There is nothing intrinsically entertaining about walking around with giant boxes tied to your body and the combat is rare enough that it only ever works as a brief palate cleanser. But there is something strangely compelling about working your way across the country, connecting everyone up and being rewarded with new gadgets if you do more than just the minimum amount of deliveries.There are also some interesting online options, where although you never meet other players directly you do see the objects they build – bridges, fast travel spots, etc. – in your world and can even help to upgrade them with your own resources. Although that does slightly unbalance the difficulty if you get to an area that a lot of other people have already visited, and it’s already filled with gadgets that help you side-step some of the trickier traversal issues.In story terms, Kojima manages to keep his worst indulgencies at bay until the end of the game, with most cut scenes and dialogue sequences being relatively succinct; until suddenly he decides every plot point has to be hammered home with a mallet in the final hours. Thematically though the game has some serious problems. For one it’s absolutely obsessed with America and yet what Kojima thinks about the country and what it stands for is not made clear at all. Not only does the game not look anything like the US but none of the characters or plot points seem uniquely American.Show the game to a random passer-by and they’d just assume it was set on another planet, which would be fine except the word ‘America’ is in almost every second line of dialogue, with ‘connect’, or some variation, right after it.There’s also a problem in the people you’re supposedly connecting with. Although there’s a handful of typically colourful main characters the ordinary ones you spend most of the game taking orders from are an extremely dull bunch that it’s impossible to gain any attachment to. You also technically never meet them, as in almost every case you’re just talking to a single person via a hologram.Most buildings seem like they’re supposed to be large underground facilities, presumably with many people living there, but it’s never made explicitly clear and some of them definitely do seem to be occupied by just one or two people. Even when you visit a city that has multiple small houses all the doors are locked and you never see a soul, which is very odd.Perhaps the absence of real people, and the fact that you never really meet anyone, is meant to be a commentary on the incorporeal nature of Internet socialising but considering how on the nose a lot of the other plot points are that seems a stretch.We’re used to some games not realising their full potential but the strange thing about Death Stranding is that it ignores the story implications of its lack of violence in favour of vague pontificating about not being a loner and the impermanence of existence. That and an increasing obsession with plot twists that, while nonsensical, are still easy to predict simply because they seem like the sort of thing Kojima would do.The dialogue in cut scenes is generally good, if long-winded and repetitive, but the facial animation is superb, with some of the best acting performances gaming has ever seen. The cinematography is equally good too, which combined with the graphics makes this one of the best-looking games of the generation. If not actually the best.I beat Spider-Man 2 in 14 hours and I want my money back - Reader’s FeatureOnly 1% of Netflix users are taking advantage of a free little-known perkAlan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepBut taken as a whole Death Stranding is an awkward mishmash of ideas, some of which work exactly as intended and others of which feel entirely out of place. At 40+ hours it overstays its welcome but it’s still a fascinating journey to take, with Kojima being the only video games auteur who can still command a large budget and use it to create something that isn’t just pandering to mainstream tastes.For that alone he and Sony deserve all the praise they can get, but Death Stranding still feels like a missed opportunity. All the elements are there to make a classic game but, ironically, they haven’t been connected up in a way that makes the most thematic and gameplay sense. Some will love the game and some will hate it, but most will be stranded somewhere in the middle.In Short: A work of unbridled ambition and imagination but also a pretentious, contrived, and frequently quite dull gameplay experience – Death Stranding is peak Hideo Kojima.Pros: Fascinatingly strange game world and main characters. Solid combat and stealth mechanics. Superb graphics, with excellent voice-acting and facial animation. Interesting online features.Cons: The core gameplay loop of delivering packages can be very boring and repetitive. Narrative doesn’t align properly with the non-violent gameplay.Score: 7/10

Game Informer,"The mystery around Death Stranding has piqued everyone’s curiosity as to the game’s true nature. Part of this is down to the creator himself, Hideo Kojima, who has consistently obfuscated his titles with complex stories, themes, and the personal fancies of an auteur. It’s also due to the incredulous feeling that there must be more to the game than what we’ve seen so far. Surely players must do more than transport cargo – a video game trope in and of itself. But Death Stranding (whose main character is named Sam Porter Bridges, no less) is unable to muster significance.In order to rebuild America after a mysterious event that has blown a crater in the middle of the country and destroyed society as we know it, Sam treks across the land delivering supplies and connecting pockets of survivors. Doing so requires loading Sam up with packages of various sizes, weights, and possibly mission-ending stipulations – such as breaking fragile equipment and even delivering a pizza correctly.I was initially frustrated by the teeter-totter nature of keeping my balance while traversing rocky, moss-covered landscapes. As I leveled up and became proficient in my movements (the terrain is thankfully consistent in terms of what does and doesn’t trip you up), I realized the fight to stay upright isn’t the fundamental problem with the core gameplay concept. The real issue is that Death Stranding’s gameplay really is as simple as it appears to be, and the elements around it – the story, combat, and lackluster mission objectives – aren’t satisfying enough to anchor the title and get players invested.Death Stranding has optional side missions and ways to build up the infrastructure of the world, such as making roads and other helpful structures, but the core delivery loop doesn’t branch out in more interesting directions. Your objectives are straightforward and unsurprising; they don’t expand Sam’s interaction with the world, nor do they require novel resourcefulness. It’s all about the journey, as they say, but when the journey feels dull, that’s not a good thing. Combat is also part of Sam’s travels, but it’s not demanding or engaging. Multi-dimensional spirits called BTs rise from the ground and apparate from the air, but they feel more like nuisances than challenges – similar to random encounters in an RPG that cause you to swear more than lick your chops. Marauders called MULEs get physically tougher and have guns and trucks to hunt you down, but defeating them is easy, whether using guns, melee blows, or stealth. Don’t expect the ingenuity or problem-solving required in the Metal Gear series; enemies’ A.I. routines and reactions don’t enliven your interactions with them or encourage experimentation.Sure, it’s fun to knock marauders down with a piece of luggage in your hand, but you can’t drive them from an area, their encampments are basic, and their loot (unless tied to a specific mission) isn’t particularly enticing since the items can be found elsewhere in the world. Combat is non-essential to the point that plain hoofing it is as effective as any weapon when dealing with both BTs and MULEs. Even the boss battles, if they can even be called that, are simple encounters of shooting and evading over multiple rounds. They lack the inventiveness and thrill of Kojima’s previous efforts, to say nothing of other games. This is a shame, because you can fabricate some pretty useful equipment, like grenade launchers and camouflage rocks you can hide under, despite an absence of compelling situations in which to apply them.Overall, Death Stranding’s intertwining systems are well thought out. Rain and snow (called Timefall) damage everything they touch, so I like the sense of urgent survival when the weather report shows precipitation on the way. Building zip-lines and safe houses in useful areas is satisfying, especially since they augment the overall network of nodes that keep you supplied and aid your travels.Death Stranding’s online connectivity is one of the game’s strengths, not only because other real-life players add useful items like ladders and warning signs to your world, but because it achieves what it tries to do: It creates bonds. I liked knowing I was helping others when I erected a bridge or anchored a rope at a key location, and enjoyed giving others praise for their efforts via the like system. Regardless, this sentiment wanes amidst the larger morass of routine.That the game ultimately comes up short is unfortunate, because there were times when I was spurred on to complete my delivery mission. Coming over a ridge, reflecting on how far I’d come and knowing that I just had to make it across one final expanse before delivering my cargo felt like sweet relief at times. The game is also visually stunning, which helps when spending all that time traveling from one place to another.Try as it might, Death Stranding’s story doesn’t shore up its faults. It’s the normal Kojima mix of twists-and-turns, tropes, and overbearing themes, but at least I like that it explores real-world topics like the theory of multiple dimensions and key events in the history of the planet’s biodiversity. Like Sam himself, I often wasn’t sure why I kept going in Death Stranding. Maybe there was a little bit of pride in another task checked off the list, another job done. Unfortunately, this added up to little reward in the end.

   on July 13, 2020 at 3:36PM PDTPC version update: The vast, beautiful, desolate world of Death Stranding lives on PC in top-notch form. After about 15 hours with the game, I'm drawn back into its melodramatic story and unique gameplay loop of cargo delivery simulation and harrowing stealth-action. To reconnect the country in Death Stranding is to also connect with the many players who are doing the same, and through asynchronous multiplayer design, you both engage in rebuilding the world together while helping one another do your in-game jobs.Given the right specs, the PC version of Death Stranding can look and run much better than it did on the PS4 Pro (I played using a Core i7-7700K CPU and RTX 2080 video card). I ran 2560x1080 resolution, as the game supports native 21:9 ultrawide aspect ratio, and every setting maxed out while using Nvidia's DLSS antialiasing option. And through action sequences and heavy weather hikes, the frame rate is consistently in the high 90 FPS to 110 FPS. This is a proper PC port that looks stunning and runs smooth.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

It's a tall order. A lot of people believe in it, but you're not sure you do. It'll take a lot of lonely, dangerous walks and exceptionally heavy lifting, and it's not really clear what America means in the first place. For some reason, you set out anyway, trudging through wetlands and rocky hills on foot, not fully knowing or understanding where you're going. Other than the monsters you can't quite see, there's not really anyone else around most of the time--just you and your thoughts, one foot in front of the other.On one level, Death Stranding is about America. But your actual goal in setting out across the country is to help people, bring them together, and forge connections, not for the vague concept of America but for the sake of helping the people within it. Death Stranding is unrelenting in its earnestness and optimism--certainly not without its critiques of America, nor without its challenges and setbacks, but inherently hopeful nonetheless. It is a dense, complex, slow game with a plot that really goes places, but at its core, it never stops being about the sheer power and purpose we can find in human connection, and that is its most remarkable achievement.Rebuilding the country is as simple as getting every far-flung city, outpost, and individual onto one network, the bones of which were laid down by a pseudo-government organization called Bridges. As Sam Porter Bridges (played by Norman Reedus), all you have to do to win people over is bring them packages; most people never go outside due to mysterious monsters called BTs, but unlike most people, Sam can sense them enough to sneak past them and get important cargo to its destination.Deliveries can be arduous. You're evaluated on your deliveries across a few categories, but the condition of the cargo can make or break a run, and there are a lot of factors working against you. The landscape can be extremely punishing, from expanses of exhaustingly rocky hills to rivers that are too deep and wide to cross unaided. On top of BTs, you also have to contend with Timefall, a kind of rain that rapidly accelerates aging and deterioration for most of the things it touches. Extended exposure to Timefall can damage or completely ruin your cargo, as can slipping and falling, getting hit by an enemy, or, in some cases, just being a little too rough with it. Even the smallest rocks can trip you up, too. In order to keep your footing, you need to pay close attention to where you're stepping, keeping your balance with the triggers while on rough terrain or when carrying a lot of stuff.Once you reach your destination, though, you're showered with praise. The recipient will likely thank you to your face (albeit as a hologram), and then they'll give you a series of social media-style likes. You're inundated with a multi-page results screen itemizing all the likes you received for the delivery and in which categories, plus an overall rating for the delivery itself, no matter how small--it's positive reinforcement turned up to 11. These likes then funnel into each of the delivery categories like experience points, and as you level up, you can carry more weight or better maintain your balance, among other benefits. Deliveries also feed into a connection rating with each city, outpost, or person, and as that increases, you acquire better gear and sometimes gifts to reward your efforts further.In short, you give a lot and get a lot in return. There is a relatively small number of mandatory deliveries to advance the story, but there's a seemingly unlimited number of optional deliveries, and I often found myself picking up orders destined for any place that was on my way. It's a cycle that's easy to get swept up in; no matter how difficult a delivery or how far the distance, you will at least be met with gratitude, likely feel fulfilled from having completed a tough delivery, and often given a tool to make future deliveries a bit easier. Most importantly, though, increasing your bonds with people is how you get them on the network, and the network is what elevates this core loop beyond the simple satisfaction of completing tasks and getting rewards.The chiral network is a kind of souped-up internet that allows you to 3D print objects, which is incredibly useful and a strong incentive in itself. When at a terminal connected to the chiral network, you can print ladders and ropes for traversal, new boots as yours wear out, repair spray for damaged containers, and basically anything else you need to safely deliver cargo so long as you have a blueprint for it. You can also print a portable printer that builds structures for you out in open areas covered by the network--things like bridges, watchtowers, and generators, the latter of which are critical as you start to use battery-powered exoskeletons and vehicles.The chiral network also grants you access to the online component of the game, which is absolutely essential. You never see other players in the flesh, but their impact is all around you; once an area is on the network, you can see structures and objects left behind by other players in the course of their own journeys, plus helpful signs they've put down just for those who come after them. You can pick up someone else's lost cargo and deliver it for them, too, knowing that someone else may find yours at some point and do you the same kindness.In Death Stranding's best moments, the relief and gratitude you can feel toward someone you don't even know is an unrivaled multiplayer experience. At one point in my playthrough, I was being chased by MULEs, human enemies who love to steal cargo. I was on a bike, tasked with a time-sensitive delivery, almost out of battery and totally unequipped to deal with external threats. In my panic, I drove my bike into a ravine. As I slowly made my way up and out of it, I watched as my bike's battery dipped into the red, and I dreaded getting stuck with all my cargo and no vehicle, still quite a ways away from my destination. I rounded a corner and found myself in the charging area of a generator placed by another player, as if they'd known I'd need it in that exact spot at that exact moment. They probably just put it there because they needed a quick charge, but to me, it was a lifeline.You can give and receive likes for these player-to-player structures, and just like with standard deliveries, it's a strong incentive to do something helpful for someone else. In the earlier sections of the game, I was using other people's structures far more than I was leaving behind help for others. But I wanted to pay it forward and know that my help was appreciated, so I started going out of my way to build structures I myself didn't really need; the map shows the online structures in your instance, making it easier to spot areas you could fill in for others. At first, the likes system seems like a pretty obvious commentary on social media and our dependence on external validation. But it's not so much a critique as it is a positive spin on a very human need for acceptance, and the system does a remarkable job of urging you to do your best for those around you, NPCs and real people alike. Feeling truly appreciated can be a rare occurrence in life, and it's powerful in its simplicity here.The first few hours of the game are the slowest, and a large part of that is because you don't have access to the online component right away. It's an incredibly lonely stretch of time during which you mostly just walk; the work you do early on is especially laborious in the absence of advanced gear, and it serves to give you an appreciation for other players and better gear as you move forward.Even as the gameplay opens up, you continue to get a lot of story exposition with almost no explanation. It can all seem kind of goofy at first, and you can get lost in the metaphors; every city you need to add to the chiral network has ""knot"" in its name, for example, and they are all referred to as ""knots"" on a strand that connects the country. There's bizarre and unwarranted product placement in the form of Monster Energy drinks and the show Ride with Norman Reedus. Guillermo del Toro's likeness is used for a kind of dorky character called Deadman, and there's a woman named Fragile in a game about delivering packages.But the story really does go deeper than that. In keeping with the theme of human connection, each of the core characters you meet and work with has their own story to tell. They all have a unique perspective on death that lends them an equally unique perspective on life, and unravelling their characters, down to the true origins of their often literal names, contributes to the overall tapestry of Death Stranding's take on the human experience. As they open up to Sam, Sam opens up to them in turn, developing into a distinct character in his own right out of the reserved, emotionless man he appears to be at the start. I grew to love Sam, Fragile, and Heartman especially, and even the characters I didn't like as much add to the game's overall message about hope and love in the face of adversity.By far my favorite character--and the most important one--is BB. BBs are infants in pods that can detect the presence of BTs, and they're issued to porters like Sam to help them navigate dangerous territory. You're told to treat BBs like equipment, not real babies, but it's impossible to think of your BB that way. It's full of personality, giggling when happy and crying when stressed out; it even gives you likes from time to time. There aren't many children left in Death Stranding's isolated, fearful world, but BB is your reminder that the future is counting on you, regardless of how you feel about America itself. The love that grows between Sam and BB is nothing short of heartwarming.Connecting with this story, just as with connecting with NPCs and other players, can take work. It's not a story that immediately clicks on a surface level, and the dramatic mystery and off-the-wall science don't make too much sense at first blush. But it's an emotional story first and foremost, and making sense of things--while entirely possible, particularly if you read the letters and interviews that detail small bits of lore as you go--is not as important as reflecting on how it makes you feel.You have plenty of opportunities to do that, too. In the quiet moments of travel, usually as you near your destination, music might start to play. The soundtrack, which is largely composed of one band--Low Roar--is phenomenal, the kind of contemplative folk-ish music that suits a trip alone through a meadow or down a mountain. Because the act of walking is so involved, it's not a time to detach completely and zone out; it's a time to feel your feelings or at least consider what's next in your travels.You can just as soon be ripped out of that headspace, though, by a shift to the haunting music that signals BT territory. The otherworldly growls of BTs as they close in on you can be terrifying, and early on, your best bet is to freeze in your tracks and hold your breath for as long as you can so you can quietly sneak by them. But there are times when you have to fight a BT in its true form, and for that, you have specialized weapons to take them down. These BTs aren't the ethereal humanoid shapes that float above the ground but huge eldritch horrors that screech under clouds of blood. The combat is mechanically simple--you mostly have to move around a bit and hit them before they hit you--but the sequences are visually and aurally arresting.You don't get a gun that works on live enemies until 25 or so hours in, but even then, it's non-lethal. You are actively guided away from killing in Death Stranding, because when people die, their bodies basically go nuclear and level cities, leaving nothing but craters and BTs in their wake. On top of that, the main human enemies are MULEs, former porters just like Sam that have been corrupted by an automated world--they've essentially become addicted to snatching cargo in their desperation to have a job and a purpose as more and more people become replaced by machines. They're not evil, and killing them seems like, well, overkill; it's easy enough to knock them out with the nonlethal methods you continue to unlock as the game progresses. I didn't kill a single one in my playthrough, though punching them is satisfying.While BTs and MULEs are a concern when delivering cargo, there's also Mads Mikkelsen's character, a man who's introduced through memories Sam sees when he connects to BB's pod. He gets his own dedicated segments that punctuate hours of simple deliveries, and these highly contained, much shorter sections are striking in their art direction and juxtaposition to the rest of the game. It's not immediately clear what he is, whether it's an enemy, potential friend, or something else entirely, but he's captivating in his ambiguity.The most cartoonish enemy is Troy Baker's Higgs, a terrorist whose depravity seems to know no bounds. Of all the characters, Higgs is the weakest, with far less nuance to him than anyone else in the cast. He's really just there as a Big Bad to motivate you in a more traditional video game sense than delivering packages and helping people, but he and his band of faceless terrorists are more a means to an end than full-fledged villains. He's the catalyst for some of the major BT fights, and in the end, perhaps an extreme reminder that it's possible to stay hopeful even when things are darkest.Death Stranding argues in both its story and its gameplay that adversity itself is what makes things worth doing and life worth living.Death Stranding is a hard game to absorb. There are many intertwining threads to its plot, and silly names, corny moments, and heavy exposition belie an otherwise very simple message. That comes through much more clearly in the game's more mundane moments, when you find a desperately-needed ladder left behind by another player or receive a letter from an NPC thanking you for your efforts. It's positive without ignoring pain; in fact, it argues in both its story and its gameplay that adversity itself is what makes things worth doing and life worth living. It's a game that requires patience, compassion, and love, and it's also one we really need right now.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"
Polygon,"Filed under:The most advanced walking simulator the world has ever seenIf you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.Video game quests come in all shapes and sizes. There are big, splashy main-story quests. There are quests that reveal the dark backstory of one of your compatriots. There are the obnoxious follow-that-stranger-without-being-seen quests. And then, at the very bottom of the unspoken quest hierarchy, there are ... fetch quests. After years of wondering what Death Stranding actually is, I can finally report that it’s a game composed entirely of fetch quests. Forty-plus hours of that may sound like torture, but shockingly, it’s actually pretty damn fun once it gets out of its own way. Before you start delivering boxes to and fro, you should know that Death Stranding’s story is weird. I’ll spare you the intricate lexicon that Hideo Kojima created to describe every bizarre paranormal phenomenon, but here’s the quickie version: Most of America is gone because ghosts showed up and killed people. When those people died, their bodies blew up. And people caught in those blasts also blew up. The initial event was called the Death Stranding, and it wiped out a very large chunk of America’s population. All that remains are small, walled city-states, completely cut off from one another. Now there’s an immediate need for “porters” — people assigned to deliver supplies to the different cities, risking their hides in the dangerous wastelands of America — in this new, splintered country. That’s where Sam Bridges (Norman Reedus) comes in. He has developed a reputation as a top-notch porter, and is enlisted by the president — who also happens to be his mom (!) — to travel the wastes and bring the isolated cities back into the fold by connecting them to a fancy data network. “If we don’t all come together again, humanity will not survive,” the president says.This all sounds pretty grandiose, but the actual process of reconnecting the cities is far simpler: Sam walks there, asks if they’re up for it, and jacks them in during a cutscene. Some of the inhabitants take some convincing, asking Sam for a favor or two before he can plug in the Ethernet cable. Then, once they’re on the grid, Sam continues making his way west.The actual walking in Death Stranding is incredibly complex: Each small rock or ledge is capable of tripping Sam, sending his packages flying. I find myself constantly scanning the environment, surveying the landscape to find the smoothest possible route through a perilous rocky outcropping. There’s no automatic parkour or physics-defying cliff climbing here. Every step I take needs to be intentional, or I might end up taking a serious tumble. When I overload my pack I have to use the left and right triggers to balance my weight, or else I risk falling over, damaging my goods. It’s equally engaging and frustrating as I topple over after twisting my ankle, forcing myself to restack all my belongings. Death Stranding is a walking simulator in the truest sense.Kojima and his team devote Death Stranding’s first 10 hours to breaking up the walking gameplay with melodramatic cutscenes that seek to explain the game’s world. These cutscenes are outrageously overwritten and long, frequently stating (and then repeating) the same talking points, dragging the pace of the introduction to an absolute crawl. This is, after all, a Kojima game, and he’s nothing if not verbose. The stilted, over-the-top writing frequently gets in the way of some solid performances, notably from Reedus and from Lindsay Wagner as Sam’s mother, the president.It’s a true feat to be able to deliver some of the game’s dialogue in a convincing way (e.g., “Bridget, you’re the president of jack shit”). While some of the actors can pull this off, others, like Léa Seydoux (who plays a character called Fragile), have a tough time selling the emotion of the stiff writing. There’s also the weird sense that Kojima tried to jam many of his famous friends in as cameos, with mixed results. Director Guillermo del Toro wisely provided just his likeness for one of the main characters, Deadman, leaving the voice acting to Jesse Corti, who does a solid job. But then Conan O’Brien shows up in a side mission, and suddenly the illusion of this world is dashed.  The story’s best moments depart from Kojima’s technobabble — “a cryptobiote a day keeps the timefall away,” says Fragile at one point — in favor of telling personal stories about the survivors of this twisted world and what motivates them to keep going. A boyfriend and girlfriend longing to be together, yet separated by an impassable desert of death. A pair of sisters who haven’t spoken in years but still share some kind of connection. These smaller stories are the ones that click in Death Stranding. The larger, grander tale — about the apocalyptic “Death Stranding” itself, the mystery of what caused it, and the challenges of fixing it — ends up feeling wooden in comparison.It takes about 10 hours for the throat-clearing to wrap up and for Death Stranding’s structure and mechanics to fully reveal themselves. And those 10 hours are some of the weakest in the game, thanks to the endless cutscenes and a series of bummer quests that have me lugging packages (and even a corpse!) up steep hills in the rain. I’m never given a great reason for these initial chores; I do them because I’m told I must. It is the epitome of a slog, and it’s easy to imagine that many players won’t ever make it past this stretch of the game.But even if you do, here’s the thing: The entire game is about lugging packages. That’s what you’ll be doing whenever you’re in control of Sam: bringing a box or boxes from one part of the map to another. Saying it out loud, it sounds like absolute misery.

  Something clicked for me after those first 10 hours, though. The basic loop of many open-world games involves starting out as a puny nobody and, over dozens of hours of exploring a wide expanse, gaining wondrous abilities to become a walking god. But that never really happens in Death Stranding. Sam essentially has the same abilities at the end of the story as he did in the beginning. A few handy gadgets and a little extra carrying capacity, maybe. But generally speaking, he’s the same ordinary guy with a stack of boxes. Combat sequences emphasize his limited skill set, as he’s better off avoiding conflict rather than dealing with it head-on. Occasional missions that require Sam to mix it up with people as he goes about his delivery route feel almost like an afterthought compared to his normal day-to-day travails.Something does evolve over the course of Death Stranding, but it’s not Sam; it’s the world around him. I put a ladder on the ground, creating a makeshift bridge to cross a river that may ruin some of my cargo. That ladder then has a chance to show up in other players’ games, making their own trip across the river easier. It works the same in reverse, as I suddenly start seeing helpful ropes, ladders, and footpaths popping up in this ruined America, placed there by other folks playing the game. These player-made structures don’t show up until I’ve connected a specific region to the network. The areas are barren and wild as I begin to explore them, but over time, they slowly become civilized, with some zones dramatically transformed in the process. There are plenty of hazards in the world of Death Stranding, and the aforementioned ghosts who kicked the whole mess off are some of the worst. Called BTs (for “beached things” ... because reasons), the ghosts make it incredibly dangerous to cross open plains, requiring stealth and constant awareness.Sam’s jar-enclosed baby (they’re called BBs; his is BB-28) is the star during these sequences. Humans can’t spot the ghosts with the naked eye, but BBs can. They don’t offer you radar on a minimap, though. All you get is a constant flashing and pointing of Sam’s back-mounted mechanical arm, which the BB controls to indicate the location of the nearest ghost. There are ways to aggressively handle the BTs later in the game, but in the early hours you’re just supposed to avoid them, as silently as possible. This proves especially difficult when you’re lugging a steamer trunk filled with — let me check my notes — ah yes, sperm at one point. At least that’s better than the corpse?There’s one acre of land I keep having to cross for deliveries that’s absolutely swarming with BTs. Whenever I get snagged by accident, sticky tar appears around my feet. I once spent too much time in the muck, and was suddenly dragged 50 feet by a massive, tar-covered sea beast (again, because reasons) that seemed none too concerned about the much-needed sperm I was carrying.The world around me transformed as tar sprang up everywhere, leaving just a few safe places to jump to. I had no idea what was happening or why, but suddenly I had to escape this thing, while trying to gather up my lost belongings amid the chaos. It was an outrageous visual spectacle, but not one I wanted to keep seeing, as it definitely made the task at hand considerably harder.But I slowly make my way through, time after time, becoming a true ghost-dodging master. While I became adept at these sequences, I wouldn’t call them super fun to play. They feel more like a game of Marco Polo, but instead of asshole cousins around a pool, it’s tar-summoning monster whales.So I decide to make an investment. Instead of lugging another package, I load up Sam’s backpack with a ton of materials and hike out with a plan: I’m gonna build a goddamn highway right over these ghosts. This requires thousands of materials (earned from doing quests for various cities) and can be a huge resource sink, but it’s absolutely worth it. Once constructed, the road stretches right over the land where the BTs hang, neutralizing them entirely. An area that previously took me 10 minutes of careful stealth to cross now takes seconds.Not only does my highway save me a ton of time, it also starts showing up in my friends’ games. They message me photos of them driving on my highway, thanking me for the investment. It’s enormously satisfying, even if it does ruin the natural splendor of this once-wild Scandinavian-esque landscape. The vistas in Death Stranding are astonishing, some of the most beautiful I’ve ever seen in a game, and it’s a shame to see them slowly cluttered with ugly ladders and roads. But hey, that’s progress.There are more opportunities to build on, and civilize, this land as the game continues. By the end, the world is unrecognizable from the untouched wilderness you first set out to explore and connect. It’s now a delivery man’s paradise, with every nook and cranny designed to make each shipment slightly easier. You are, quite literally, optimizing the world. Jeff Bezos would be thrilled.Interestingly, for a game that has a whole lot to say about politics, familial strife, and the nature of humanity, it never really comments on the potential downsides to this loss of natural beauty. Apparently it’s all great! I can’t really argue that, because thanks to progress, I now get to speed over those goddamn tar demons on my awesome highway. One could say that the satisfaction I felt upon building the road would have been dulled if I had reached that point sooner (i.e., without the game’s drawn-out, sloggy intro). Without the suffering, I might not have appreciated the end of that suffering. In short, is Death Stranding just giving me a bad case of Stockholm syndrome? Does it matter?Having been smitten by the core world-building gameplay of Death Stranding, I am stunned to realize that many of the game’s strongest, most appealing gameplay ideas (specifically the world-building and cooperation) are tossed aside in the final acts, in favor of a much more linear, scripted, cutscene-ridden experience. The freedom and sense of ownership I enjoyed while creating this world are dashed in favor of explaining and wrapping up a story that never had much going for it to begin with. The final 10 hours of Death Stranding are a slog, just like the first 10 hours, as my leash is tugged from emotional monologue to ridiculous boss fight to emotional monologue. While a few of these narrative threads make sense and land with some gravitas, others sound like the ramblings of someone on speed who thinks they’ve figured out how the universe works. Death Stranding feels like two games in one, designed for seemingly opposite audiences. One is a wholly unique open-world adventure with asynchronous cooperative multiplayer that allows me to feel like I’m part of a community, building a world from scratch. And the other is a long, confusing, deeply strange movie. The former is pulling most of the weight, but they share equal screen time. And, like a steamer trunk full of sperm, it’s impossible to separate the good from the bad. It’s all in the same box. Death Stranding will be released Nov. 8 on PlayStation 4 and in summer 2020 on Windows PC. The game was reviewed using a final “retail” PS4 download code provided by Sony Interactive Entertainment.

In that unveiling, all we knew was that it starred a naked Norman Reedus, that there were babies, dead sea creatures, and weird floating people. Not a lot to go on, but given Kojima's long, weird history with the long, weird Metal Gear franchise, it was enough to get people talking excitedly about all the things it could possibly be.As time has gone on, and even as Kojima has said he himself does not fully understand the game, a clearer picture began to take shape, and now that it is here, we can say definitively what Death Stranding is. It is a third-person action game, with a heavier-than-usual de-emphasis on the ""action."" It is a game about exploration in which there isn't that much to discover. It is a game about America that takes place in a world that bears only minimal resemblance whatsoever to the country it's portraying. It is a game that takes, at minimum, 10-15 hours to actually become ""fun,"" and even then the definition of fun is one likely to vary wildly for its players. It is a Hideo Kojima game in which the story is the least appealing aspect of the whole endeavor. Ultimately, Death Stranding is a game that is unlike much else I've played before, and I'm not entirely sure if I want to play anything like it ever again.In Death Stranding, you play Sam Porter Bridges. He is named that because he is a porter, tasked with delivering things to the citizens of a fractured, post-apocalyptic America, and because he is a member of Bridges, an organization dedicated to, well, building bridges--both literal and metaphorical--to those people in order to reconnect the country. Sam is a reluctant hero in the grand Kojima tradition. He's on his own, wandering the country and avoiding human contact because of past trauma, until the last President, Bridget Strand, pleads with him in her dying moments to help bring the ""chiral network"" back online, and reunite the country.This network is powered by chiralium, the game's primary McGuffin. It's a magical element that all of the game's technology is based around, and also is related to the game's apocalypse. You see, there was the titular Death Stranding. The barrier between the world of the living and the world of the dead was breached. The dead, represented here as sludgy ghosts attached to umbilical cords, roam chunks of the world and consume human bodies, creating ""voidouts,"" which are basically ghost magic nuclear explosions. Also it rains time now, and if it touches you, it ages you and wrecks your equipment, which is bad.Anyway, the chiral network. It's the super internet, and in order to reconnect America, you need to hook up the remaining cities and stations to it. Equipped with your trusty BB--a literal baby in a jar (😲) that helps you detect sludge ghosts through its link to its stillmother (😐) and the world of the dead--you do this by delivering packages to all those places. Rhythmically, this game has more in common with something like the Truck Simulator games than your standard third-person action game. As a porter, you schlep boxes of medicine and video games and semen to and from all these different stations throughout the world. Initially, all you've got are your backpack and your feet. The more jobs you take on, the more ludicrous the stack of packages on your back gets, and if you surpass Sam's weight limit, balancing and moving him becomes far more challenging.Early on, this is a pain in the ass. You're constantly trying to navigate over rough terrain and through heavy patches of time rain and all you can do is hug the R2/L2 buttons to try to balance yourself. Eventually, you are given a variety of tools to make Sam's journeys more manageable. You start out with basic things like ladders and climbing ropes before graduating to portable, floating cargo trays and full-on trucks. Crafting all these tools takes small amounts of the various resources you'll find littered around the world, but even if you aren't looking to spend a lot of time building and placing things yourself, you may find that other players have been more than happy to do the work for you. Death Stranding includes an asynchronous online system that allows things built in other players' worlds to surface in yours. There are also straight up public works projects multiple players can contribute to, including whole highway builders that greatly mitigate the frustration of trying to navigate the world.See, without those highways, vehicles aren't very useful. Death Stranding's vision of America looks like a combination of the Norwegian fjords and the surface of Mars. Rocks and cliffs are everywhere, and it's on you to build bridges (of course), highways, and whatever else is necessary to traverse these spaces. And even when you do invest heavily into the game's version of Infrastructure Week, the time rain will degrade any structure in the world, and if you don't add resources to repair them, they'll disappear.In the opening hours, this doesn't matter as much because you're just on foot and hoofing it from place to place. When you finally get vehicles, using them mostly sucks because you're constantly driving into rocks. When you finally get highways you can build, it starts to feel a little like American Truck Simulator...if you had to craft the truck and the roads yourself. And then the game just kind of gives up on that infrastructure stuff and sends you off to the mountains to criss-cross huge, snow-deluged peaks that take a very long time to get around. And then it asks you to do that a bunch more until the game is essentially over.I have several issues with Death Stranding, and one of them is pacing. This is a very lumpy game. The opening hours are a slog of endless, precarious walking and a near-constant deluge of new systems being presented to you. Then it just kind of settles into a rhythm of deliveries and discovering new places to deliver to, mostly putting the story on the back-burner until you finish the extremely long third chapter. After that, the A Hideo Kojima Production part of the game suddenly wakes up and you find yourself inundated with more cutscenes and character exposition than you'll ever know what to do with. The early hours have the feel of a child excitedly explaining to you the elaborate fantasy world they just came up with, and then the middle feels like the deep breath they take before launching into all the reasons why things are the way they are in that world. The last hour and change of the game is basically one long run-on sentence that tries to tie up every remaining loose end where you don't really do anything at all except listen to it ramble on.Look, it's not like previous Kojima games haven't had pacing issues, but Death Stranding is the most egregious example of it. It's not nearly confident enough to just rely on the delivery aspect of the game as its main thrust, so it changes things up with combat and stealth sequences that never feel all that great. Early on, combat is something you mostly want to avoid. Human enemies consist of MULES, a group of ex-porters who have been driven insane by the chemical boost they get for receiving ""likes"" from making deliveries (helloooooooo social media commentary!). They are a nuisance who will come after your cargo, but thankfully you can mostly just beat them senseless with a few quick mashes of the square button. By the time they give you bola guns and stun bombs, they become comically easy to dispatch. BTs, the aforementioned sludge ghosts, need to be avoided until you learn how to make bullets and grenades from your own blood. If you do bump into one, you have to trudge your way through a pool of moaning tar bodies while mashing square to escape. If you fail, you get whisked away to a space some distance away and fight a giant tar animal, for reasons.To be absolutely clear: these parts of the game are never all that fun. They are not broken or really even difficult; they're merely an oft-tedious distraction. They're the thing you do that's most analogous to Kojima's previous works, but the fights are never very memorable. Whenever a BT section or boss fight cropped up, I often found myself annoyed that my delivery missions were being sidelined, and that is not something I expected to say about a game like this. If I enjoyed anything about playing Death Stranding, it was the moments of solitude I experienced as I wandered from place to place, the moments of quiet beauty as I crested some big hill to see a new city on the horizon. Death Stranding is a game that shines brightest when it's willing to get out of its own way and just let the player exist free of the constraints of its own narrative and need to intersperse its mundanity with middling action.About that narrative. This being a Kojima game, there is of course a cast of strange characters that exist alongside Sam, helping his mission or standing directly in his way. Each of these characters has some kind of ludicrous backstory that they will eventually explain to you in excruciating detail, even though most of them are literally named after the primary thing that defines their existence in the game. And there are significant sections of the game where everything grinds to a halt so that Kojima (by way of one of these supporting characters) can either explain at length what's going on with any of the myriad bizarre concepts built into the game's narrative, or delve into the latest Wikipedia article he somehow found a way to graft onto the game's plot. None of these inclusions should be surprising, because this is the way Kojima directs his games.What is surprising is just how flat the vast majority of it all falls. In the Metal Gear series, Kojima's goofy tangents and batshit character monologues felt, to me at least, like amusing digressions set against the series' action cinema bravado. That stuff doesn't come off as well in what is essentially his version of an Andrei Tarkovsky movie. Nothing is allowed to be all that mysterious, and the game constantly tips its hand regarding things that might be considered twists or surprises. Whether it's through monologues, in-game emails and interviews, or someone just flatly stating the premise of what's going on out loud as obviously as possible, very little in Death Stranding is allowed to exist without overwhelming explanation.There's also a surprising dearth of memorable characters. Norman Reedus' Sam is especially bland. In a way, he's the perfect video game protagonist, because nearly all he does is grunt and sigh. There's just not much personality to him, which is a bummer given how much time you spend with him throughout the game. The only actor who feels like they're truly on board with the weirdness of the whole thing is Mads Mikkelsen, who plays an otherworldly soldier wraith that pops up just often enough to remind you that Hideo Kojima used to make some games about war. He seems like he's relishing the role, which I can't quite say for most of the other actors involved. Actresses Lea Seydoux and Margaret Qualley do their best with some truly leaden dialogue, and Troy Baker at least tries to chew (or, more accurately, lick) some scenery as the deeply disappointing terrorist villain Higgs, who is named that because he thinks he's like the God particle, and frequently references video games because I guess someone in this game probably had to do that.Frustratingly, I kept waiting for Death Stranding to offer something to say, something to justify the amount of breath spent explaining its most obvious metaphors and motivations. Unfortunately, it never gets there. Its early game musings on human connectedness and the need to bring people together never evolves over the 50 hours you'll spend playing it. The things it says at the beginning are pretty much the same things it's saying at the end, and none of those things are all that deep.Even more frustratingly, there were multiple times during the course of my time spent playing Death Stranding that I could see the strands of a game I'd really like. There are individual pieces of the game that I think work well. It's gorgeous, for one thing, offering up a well-realized world with wonderfully unusual looking technology and terrific animation work. And there were times when I found myself genuinely lost in the experience of wandering that world, lugging gear from place to place, building roads and liking ladders and just drinking in the loneliness of it all. Even the massive pile of different systems all feel like they mostly work together in a way that's harmonious.But the whole of the game never achieves that balance. There's a deep thread of insecurity that runs through it, one that manifests in its unwillingness to commit all the way to the arduousness of its main character's task, that's too willing to break that quietness with mediocre action, and that never trusts the player to understand even its most basic ideas without hitting them over the head with them. There is a weirdo, avant spirit to Death Stranding that I do admire, but that spirit fails to carry the game anywhere worthwhile.At least now we know what the hell Death Stranding is: a disappointment.© 2023 FANDOM, INC.

Even the stupidest and most pretentious developments build to create a multi-layered game, one with numerous potential points of attack to analyze. It is a story about fatherhood. It is a broad dig at the gig economy. It is deeply concerned with upcoming environmental disaster and American politics, old and new.Death Stranding is also about throwing grenades made from your own piss and shit at ghosts. It is about hiking alone in the wilderness for hours. It is a tireless grind. It is a commentary on social media and the internet, delivered through the asynchronous interactions players can have with one another as they play. It is breathtaking in scope, consistently intelligent in design, and beautiful to behold. It is a heaping pile of pretentious nonsense. It is a game in which characters drop overwrought interpretations of Kōbō Abe quotes. Its most recurring visual motif is a not-so-subtle gesture towards Thomas Pynchon’s Gravity’s Rainbow. It progresses not with the quiet stroke of a pen but with the pounding crash of a hammer. “I brought you a metaphor,” one of the characters says late in the game. It is stupid, and obvious, and perfect.""I want my BB.""UPS but spooky and political and stuff.Building mechanics strongly communicate themes, actors give it their all, hiking is both difficult and relaxing. Wow, this game!Long length, most story is backloaded to the end.Kojima ProductionsPlayStation 4 (played,) PC eventuallyNovember 8, 2019Completed the story in about 85 hours. I've played over a hundred total at this point.Death Stranding is also Hideo Kojima’s first major project following his departure from Konami in 2015. The context is charged: here is a widely acclaimed “auteur,” supposedly shackled by corporate overlords let loose at last, ready to blow your mind open with a masterpiece. The game follows on the heels of the tragic cancelation of Silent Hills, which was to be a video game collaboration with film director Guillermo del Toro, starring Norman Reedus. (Reedus now stars in Death Stranding, along with del Toro and tons of other celebrities.)Then there’s the supposed weirdness of Death Stranding itself. During development, its plot and gameplay were tightly guarded secrets, with exorbitant and celebrity-laden trailers providing the only hint of what was to come. The game has been mythologized through its marketing, and Kojima—already considered a legend—has been further mythologized along with it.But that narrative is replete with mischaracterizations. Kojima is a man with a highly skilled team at his disposal, decades of experience, celebrity friends, and millions of dollars in Sony backing. He’s no scrappier than any other rich and famous person. Because of this, there are two Death Strandings. There is the one in public consciousness, and there is the one that I have played. The first is a dream, an impossible (and frankly unnecessary) vindication of games as art created by a glorified mastermind. The actual game is a fantastic mess.But is it good, Heather? Yes, friends. I love it.Death Stranding is set in an alternate future where a cataclysmic event called the Death Stranding has devastated most of the world. The incident, described as a great explosion, has blurred the lines between the land of the living and the afterlife. In the world of Death Stranding, there is in fact something after death, and it is observable and measurable. Furthermore, every person has been discovered to contain their own “Beach,” which is a limbo-like space that they arrive at before finally moving into the great beyond. The thinning boundaries between our world and the afterlife released spirits called “beached things,” or BTs. BTs ravage communities, wreaking havoc on the living. They are so dangerous that if a human makes contact with a larger BT, it can trigger an event called a “voidout,” a sort of miniature nuclear explosion that can destroy cities in the blink of an eye. The world has been fractured into a few remaining cities and pioneer outposts. Connecting them are delivery services, staffed by porters who brave the expansive waste and sneak through BT territory to bring essential supplies to the disjointed smattering of humanity that remains.Players control Sam Porter Bridges, a lone wolf courier who is more content in the wasteland than around other people. After the last living president of the United States passes away, Sam is asked to carry out her final directive: connect the remaining settlements to the “chiral network,” a futuristic internet that allows for instant communication and fast 3D printing of infrastructure and supplies. The goal, he is told, is to “make America whole again.”Carrying out this directive becomes ever more complicated as terrorist factions conspire to kickstart mankind’s extinction, politicians cover up horrible crimes, and a literal ghost bent on revenge wages a personal war against those who wronged him. It’s operatic, excessive, and ultimately leads to a finale so spectacular and absurd that it moves beyond anime overindulgence into a glorious pimple popping of plot.So, there are grand political machinations that extend far beyond Sam’s reach. But throughout it all, he’s still just a postman who needs to make his deliveries while living in the worst possible world. To help him navigate that world, Sam is given a “bridge baby.” This baby in a pod grants Sam the ability to perceive BTs and progress on his journey across the continent. Throughout the journey, he will deliver countless packages and supplies from outpost to outpost, hiking untold miles in solitude while slowly bringing settlements into the network. Each new excursion is dogged by tough terrain, lurking BTs, raiders, and a corrosive rain called “timefall” that rapidly accelerates everything it touches.Most of the time, Sam navigates these dangers while wearing a backpack crammed with packages and gear. The contents of the backpack must be balanced. If Sam’s too heavy on either side, he’ll fall. And if Sam falls, his cargo will be damaged. It is painful to traverse terrain and all too easy to fall, especially in the early game. But over time, Sam gets stronger, and the player gains more resources.At first, Sam’s gear is little more than a good pair of shoes and maybe a rope for climbing. As players progress, they’ll gain access to a variety of robotic rigs to increase how much Sam can carry or how fast he can move in extreme terrain. Eventually, that means portable 3D printers than can build bridges or even safe houses to rest at provided you have enough raw materials.It costs a lot of materials to build a bridge or a shelter. These structures also take damage over time and must be repaired. But you aren’t the only one in this world who is building bridges over coursing rivers, or hanging ziplines in rocky mountaintops. Death Stranding will put you on a server with other players, each of them building their own structures that you can share and use. You can even deliver packages that they’ve dropped, or leave behind packages you can’t deliver yourself. Every time Sam connects another town in the world to the fictional chiral network, Death Stranding will connect you to the real-life network of other players and their structures.Sharing is rewarded. These structures exist in a pseudo-social network where players can “like” those that they find useful. The more “likes” you get, the better. It contributes to a progression system that uses a variety of criteria—mission completion time, the size of a cargo haul, completion of special conditions—to increase a player rank that eventually gives rewards, like the ability to carry more items or run down slopes without slipping as much.But it’s not just delivering packages, building bridges, and connecting people to one another. Eventually, Sam gets weapons: rifles, shotguns, and grenades, all made using Sam’s blood and other bodily fluids. Because Sam is special, you see. He’s a “repatriate,” which means that instead of dying in mortal situations, he is able to guide his soul back to his body and rise again to complete the job. This makes him a perfect candidate for tough deliveries. His bodily fluids can be weaponized against the BTs as well, especially his blood. A “hematic” grenade can dispose of a BT in an instant, while blood-soaked bullets can slowly perforate them into mist. The best option is to avoid BTs altogether, relying on Sam’s bridge baby to perceive the ghosts’ locations and sneaking past them.Death Stranding pulls from a variety of sources. The resurrections and multiplayer aspects of Dark Souls, the wandering of Proteus and No Man’s Sky, the clumsy body movements of QWOP, the skeletal remains of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain and more surprisingly Metal Gear Survive. These pieces come together into a unique package with a simple loop: you start here, now please go there. Pick a mission, grab your gear, figure out how to get there, climb over whatever mountain is in your way without losing all your cargo. Fall, get up, keep going. Rinse and repeat, with added layers of intrigue and combat challenges as the story progresses.The larger narrative of Death Stranding is spellbinding, but like The Phantom Pain before it, Death Stranding speaks more clearly through its systems, and is more interesting to play than its raw narrative is to experience. Using the game’s system of shared building and messaging, it’s possible to warn fellow players of BT hunting grounds, leave garages stocked with vehicles to freely use, drop shoes and excess gear into shared storage lockers, and create complicated pathways through a treacherous game world. The word strand, we are told early in the game, refers both to a tie that connects something and the act of being stranded, isolated from others. Just as Metal Gear Solid V’s war micromanaging expressed the endless cost of mercenary violence and revenge, Death Stranding’s systems speak to these two interpretations. Initially, players are indeed stranded. They are alone in a game world with few signs of human interaction, then slowly but surely, the topography changes. Footsteps on a path, the start of a road. These span out to form a complex spider’s web of player structures. Every piece feeds into the other. It turns out having ladders, better shoes, and increased mobility matters a lot when you might stumble over the perfectly placed rock at any moment.Eventually, I reached a particularly treacherous part of the game where most of my deliveries involved hiking through thick snowfall. A few players had braved this area before me, but I found many of their structures to be incomplete. A makeshift series of magnetic ziplines covered some peaks, but there were no connecting ziplines on the most obvious paths. The foundation of a more complex system was there; all it needed was some work to become the thing it could be. Instead of progressing forward with the story, I gathered the materials I needed and ventured through BT territory to place the required ziplines, ones that could allow travel over the most dangerous areas, the areas that Death Stranding clearly expected players to pass through.It was not easy. Time and time again, I was dragged to the ground by shadowy ghosts and pulled into a stream of tar that rushed me away from my destination. I fired bullets coated in my own blood and threw grenades containing my sweat at massive beasts until I somehow managed to get where I wanted to go. Over the course of several hours, digital blood and sweat literally spent, multiple hikes through the worst conditions accomplished, I connected my ziplines with the broader network. Anyone who came after me would be able to use them, crossing over the mountains easily and flying over the BT’s feasting ground. I’m proud of those ziplines, of the work that went into making them. I’m thankful to the strangers whose devices I literally connected with to make something that would benefit not only us, but everyone who stumbled through the treacherous paths after us. There was no real point to doing this, other that it could be done and I thought it should be done. I needed to do it. I needed to build something.During my time reviewing Death Stranding, I had a relationship fall into disrepair. That my most valued personal connection frayed while playing a game that is ultimately about the bonds we make was not lost to me. Time and time again in Death Stranding, I wandered through harsh red deserts and snow-capped peaks with the mission of bringing people together. I crossed bridges left by strangers, trusting that the paths they had laid would bring me where I needed to go. Outside of the game, I was lost. What does it mean for a connection to unravel, like an old rope bridge across a ravine? What does it take to rebuild one?I don’t have answers to this. Death Stranding didn’t provide them. Instead, it insisted on a simple idea: that we are made strong by the grace and, more beautifully, the chance of others. That we travel on the roads of those who went before us, leaving our own marks that ultimately affect the path those behind us take. We walk alone more often than we walk together, losing ineffable things along the way like so much fumbled luggage. And yet, we sometimes see signs of care. In life, they’re small. A random text message from an old friend, a free drink at the neighborhood bar, an enthusiastic conversation with a co-worker about nothing important, the sound of your roommate playing his guitar. In Death Stranding, these things are literal. A generator powering our car in the middle of nowhere, a glowing thumbs up emblem at the city gates, a ladder crossing a flowing stream, a structure protecting us from the acid rain.“I brought you a metaphor.” Death Stranding’s multiplayer aspects function as both criticism of online parasocial relationships and a strong metaphor for themes of togetherness and worker solidarity. Crossing the lonely wasteland encourages players to build narratives in their minds. Stumbling upon new bridges and seeing the names of familiar players, it’s easy to believe you know something about them. I noted how one player seemed to place their structures in areas with heavy foot traffic, maximizing “likes.” Another always seemed a step ahead, building exactly what was needed with care and consideration. You build affection for some players, annoyance for others. The opportunists, the caregivers. You crave “likes” and engagement because it feels good to have something, anything in the wasteland. One time, I built the start of a highway outside of a distribution center and woke up to find the road had been expanded by someone else. My initial structure has thousands of likes. Later on, returning to it, someone else’s name was presented as the owner and they had even more praise than I’d received. Who was this asshole, swooping in to take implicit responsibility for something I had built? I bet he’s the kind of person who steals people’s jokes on Twitter. These thoughts are, of course, nonsense. There’s no more sense to our interaction than whatever meaning I brought to it. Yet I cannot help but believe I know who they are, and accept that they’ve undoubtedly formed their own thoughts about me.In practice, building structures and expanding pathways creates more camaraderie than contention. There’s no denying the strange narrative context underpinning it all⁠—we were, after all, extending from coast to coast in an effort to make America whole again⁠—but the effect of these mechanics is more romantic than unfortunate. Countless workers, united in the solidarity of their task, creating public and functional means to allow essential services to continue. The work mattered enough that players had each other’s backs and tended to the essential parts without prompting. Death Stranding waxes poetic about intertwining souls and bonds that last from one world to the next. If love, sadness or duty could move from the land of the living to the dead, then perhaps these feelings of pride and solidarity can shift from the digital to the actual. We made something; we helped each other. Video game or not, there’s a comfort in that. It turns out that being an Amazon worker in the apocalypse isn’t so bad when solidarity prevails.The larger world of Death Stranding is far from idyllic. Scattered throughout the broken continent are pockets of hoarders know as MULEs, as well as other terrorists, all of whom are eager to steal Sam’s cargo. These human adversaries provide a different challenge from BTs. If you want to pilfer MULE supplies or rob caches from terrorists, you still can engage in some stealth action, as you would with BTs. High grass and natural obstacles provide plenty of means for ingress, and gear like a bola gun and rope to tie up enemies let you incapacitate foes. The other option is loud and hectic, and just as worthwhile. With the right arsenal, it’s possible to descend upon an enemy camp like a marauding archangel, firing away with non-lethal rounds—killing a human would produce a BT, after all—and causing frantic firefights that reward prize resources and gear.This is the most obvious vestige of Metal Gear Solid’s DNA. While Death Stranding is not an action game, it does handle action well when needed. This extends to boss fights, which I cannot spoil here except to say that they range from stealth guerilla affairs to biblical clashes that would feel right at home in Yoko Taro’s Drakengard. Violence is a last resort, and Death Stranding is best experienced in a careful and stealthy fashion, but when the time comes for the silence to break and explosions to ring out, it’s powerful. Not everything can be solved with a bridge. Combat is a hard truth, and one that always feels dirty and messy.All of this is work. Death Stranding is a long and grueling game, but that grind and sweat is fundamentally important to its identity. After the initial plot is set up, the next 40 to 50 hours are devoted to quiet hikes and desperate forays with only a few plot punctuations. In Death Stranding, labor is key, and offering any convenience to the player outside of a few weapons and gadgets would rub against the game’s themes. If players are meant to value connections, they need to be alone for hours.I did have a constant companion in these journeys: my friend and colleague Tim Rogers. We have talked for hours in his darkened office, chatted relentlessly over Slack messages. Plenty of it was goofing for goofs’ sake but when the time came for us to think about the world design, Tim spoke clearly.“Games build excitement out of parts a filmmaker would edit,” he told me.I can think of the moment that was most clear to me. Multiple hours spent in snowy mountains assembling underappreciated ziplines and shelters had taken its toll. I was playing a portion of Death Stranding that was miserable, which gave me the harshest environment and robbed me of essential tools. Cold lapped at my face, steel girders popped out of the snow like massive crucifixes. For two nights, all I knew was snow and acid rot. All I knew was white. Then I came over a ridge and saw green again. Glorious, growing grass. I wish I had the words to describe what it meant to see the color green again. It wouldn’t have mattered nearly as much if I didn’t put in all that goddamn work beforehand. I don’t think you can do that with a montage or smash cut.For all of Kojima’s pretensions as a would-be filmmaker, for all of the celebrity casting and cameos from his famous friends, not to mention the corniness of the Monster Energy Drink brand deal (drinking the stuff in-game will fill your stamina gauge), the glue that holds everything together is how well Death Stranding works as a game. While a majority of the time is spent wandering, it’s never pointless, and even the emptier interactions⁠—what does it even mean to “like” a stranger, anyway?⁠—contribute to a whole that is always asking you to consider something. That can be the uncomfortable implications of American expansionism, the current era of Trumpism, the disastrous effects of climate change, the vapid but reassuring nature of social media, the raw physicality of bodies, or broader notions of labor. It’s all there, and it’s wrapped into a game that is both hard work and rewarding to play.The strongest story in Death Stranding is the one told by its systems, but the cut-scenes and other narrative elements are still captivating, a slow burn that starts with quiet character moments and ends with a mountain-high pile-up of plots and motivations. Death Stranding takes a long time to define its world, and still leaves plenty to implication when the credits roll. There’s a lore database for learning some terms, but Death Stranding comfortably luxuriates in ambiguity before exploding outward into excessive action. Buried under all of the sci-fi terminology is a simple story; once everyone’s motivations have been laid bare, it’s not nearly as complicated one might imagine based on the game’s bizarre trailers. Death Stranding is ultimately more impressive in the raw sensory overload than in the moment to moment plot, but it’s hard to deny how much of an improvement its storytelling technique is when compared to Metal Gear Solid V’s lumbering monologues and swooping camera movements. Death Stranding, for all its convolution and visual excess, is evocative and often moving.Much of this is owed to how much the actors commit to their roles, even if they’re often tasked with spouting overwrought metaphors or clumsy exposition dumps. There’s a sense that everyone knows this is a little bullshit, and that winking edge comes hand in hand with a larger commitment to the story as a whole. It’s more like watching opera or musical theater than a film. At times, its tone comes off more like a sentai show or B-movie, schlocky and sometimes sleazy. There are grand gestures, deep outpourings of emotion, deliberate choreography.It’s hard not to like Sam Bridges, who faces all of Death Stranding’s bizarreness with a welcome everyman’s weariness, encapsulated  in Norman Reedus’ characteristic growl. Troy Baker hams it up as the villainous Higgs, and Léa Seydoux nails the mixture of toughness and raw emotionality as Sam’s close ally ‘Fragile.” Then there’s Mads Mikkelsen, who commands attention every time he’s on screen. Yeah, it’s funny as hell to hear him whisper “I want my BB,” but when the time comes, he puts in the damn work.Death Stranding sometimes falls into reductive gender tropes, in much the same way that other Kojima games do. This is a story of fatherhood, very often to the expense of the women in the cast. Sam’s ongoing bond with his bridge baby intersects with the story of Mads Mikkelsen’s mysterious villain Cliff, underpinning the main plot’s world-shaking politics with more human and relatable sentiments. But Death Stranding stumbles when the time comes to handle the women and their stories. There are gestures at motherhood themes to go along with the fatherhood themes, such as a storyline that uses ghosts as metaphor for postpartum depression, but this is ultimately a story about men, and one where even the bravest sacrifices of the female characters come hand in hand with the same characteristic leering camerawork of Kojima’s previous games. It’s never so gross as Metal Gear Solid V’s Quiet, but it’s still a noticeable issue that undercuts the narrative’s larger examination of parental pain and sacrifice.That said, Death Stranding is also just as infatuated with the male body. Whether that’s the sensual framing of Mikkelsen smoking a cigarette or the way the camera moves to ensure you’ve seen just enough of Reedus’ naked body during shower scenes, Death Stranding’s bisexual camera is more interested in men than even the torture-laden, blood licking Metal Gear franchise. The difference is ultimately in how lovingly men are framed compared to women, both by the literal camera and also their place in the larger narrative. Fragile’s body can be marred by timefall, rain lapping at her skin, but it’s still ultimately Léa Seydoux running in the rain as the camera focuses on her ass. Reedus stands naked on a beach, and Mikkelsen rises out of a tar pit, and yeah, it’s sexy, but they’re also allowed far more nobility.Death Stranding deals with many universal themes—children and their guardians, death, labor—but it is also speaking to more specific current topics as well. At the forefront is a deeply environmentalist sentiment about deteriorating habitats, extreme weather, and societal collapse. As reports flood in about our mounting climate crisis and the resulting cost of inaction, Death Stranding imagines a world where the most extreme conditions fracture the ties that bind the world together. This is evident in the world design, which ranges from rocky shoals and more reasonable terrain to extremely alien topography. There are portions of the map that look more like Mars than Earth, nearly blood red in the color of the sands. Raging snowstorms warp space-time, and sunken cities lurk beneath rising tides of tars.Death Stranding’s conflict rises to biblical proportions. Many characters believe that humanity is doomed no matter what, that any action forestalling imminent extinction is a band-aid on a mortal wound. After all, with enough time, there’s no doubt that humanity will be little more than dust. Death Stranding has an undercurrent of fatalism that feels very much of the moment. Even as other characters maintain a hope that a better, sustainable future is possible, there is also a quiet acceptance that, you know, maybe we really are struggling in the face of something too big. That the little victories we find might be dwarfed by the larger problems we face. This is never offered as an excuse for idleness; it is clear there is work to do, despite it all. Death Stranding pulls between these two extremes. One that says there is no point. Another that says although the future is unknowable, there’s a duty to fight for something better, even as the sun grows hot, the bodies pile, and world cracks.This message comes paired with gestures towards modern American politics. “Make America whole again” is the common refrain. In Death Stranding, America is a nation broken, scattered to disparate pockets of people just trying to get by, beset by monsters and marauders. The solution to this issue is suitably quixotic: what if we just fix communication lines between everyone? It’s an idea that doesn’t grapple with some of the more pressing questions of modern American politics—for instance, civil resistance—and one that can seem naive. The fracturing of real-life America is a symptom of a larger systemic problem of bigotry that’s seen a rise in violence and isolationist rhetoric around the world. In the face of this moment, Death Stranding decides that this is fixable. That the politics of division can give way into something more holistic and inclusive. Death Stranding, to its detriment, never quite reckons with its use of American iconography—it is a nation founded on slavery and colonial slaughter—but it still opts to point a finger. Things as they are cannot stand or they will lead to ruin.The silver lining, of course, is other people. Death Stranding is not a subtle game. The mechanics are the message. Build connections, use those to literally span divides. Even as the story swells to a convoluted chaos that would make Metal Gear Solid 4’s monstrous canon-welding blush, Death Stranding’s most fundamental point is not hard to understand. Yes, this is hell. Yes, we are falling apart. Yes, this might be the end. But there is redemption in other people. "
USgamer,"Death Stranding is out now on PC, complete with graphical improvements and some PC exclusive content like wearable Half-Life headcrabs. You can read our original review below. Hideo Kojima has always been fascinated by attrition: Tapping Circle through the pain in Metal Gear Solid's torture scene, Solid Snake gasping as he crawls through MGS 4’s oven hallway, the extended ladder sequence of MGS 3, and the uncomfortably long jeep ride with Skull Face in MGS 5. Death Stranding is his attempt at capturing that feeling, effort as a mechanic, and selling it as an entire game. The results are mixed.Death Stranding is a video game about the spaces in-between. A cataclysmic event has severed the balance between life and death. The dead appear to the living, dragging them into another dimension known as the Beach, and the people who brave this terrifying world are forced to use Bridge Babies (or BBs) to sense them. These unborn babies are encased in an artificial womb - not dead, but not quite alive, existing in their own purgatory, too. Schrödinger’s tot.It’s also quite literally about the spaces in-between - the large swathes of landscape you travel across. Where most video games are built around what you do when you reach your destination - absentmindedly pushing forward on a stick or revving a vehicle to a destination - here the journey is the game, not the shooting people when you get there. It took 22 hours of playing Death Stranding before even I fired my first proper gun.

Since we got that very first trailer, people have been asking what Death Stranding actually is. Is it a stealth game? Sometimes. Is it an action game? Occasionally. For the most part, Death Stranding is a mountaineering game. Kojima has been talking up the online aspect - where structures created by other players appear in your world and vice versa (thank you, Captaindongs, for the bridge) - but it’s in the traversal where the game really does feel different. While there’s the odd boss fight and small pockets of combat scattered throughout, the majority of this huge 40-60 hour game is spent walking, planning, and creating infrastructure to make subsequent journeys easier.You take control of Sam Bridges (Norman Reedus) as he attempts to spread chiral network (spooky internet) coverage across America, travelling from the east coast to the west. You go to a terminal, accept a job, and stack up cargo on your back and limbs. You stack as much as you can carry without toppling over like a human Jenga tower, then you head out into the weirdly Icelandic USA. Between jobs, you kick it in a private room and take showers, pull faces in a mirror, and drink Monster Energy. Sometimes you see Norman Reedus’s full ass. Sometimes he winks at the camera. Sometimes you take a shit and an advert for Reedus’s AMC motorbike show pops up on the shower curtain. Why do you take a shit? Because the game turns your shit, piss, and sweat into different types of grenades. The poo one? EX Grenade Number Two, obviously.Hideo Kojima, a man in his 50s who once tweeted about his eggs looking like boobs, is known for having a puerile sense of humour, and that remains intact. One area that has improved here is in his portrayal of women. Yes, they might have daft names, but there is not a single whiff of tit. Progression! If it wasn’t for Troy Baker’s character, Higgs, occasionally licking peoples’ faces and, at one point, slapping Lindsey Wagner’s arse, it’d be a flawless victory.Let’s talk about those silly names for a moment. Heartman? He’s a guy who has a heart attack every 21 minutes. Die-Hardman? He hasn’t died once. Deadman is made of dead people, obviously. You idiot. Mama? She’s got a ghost baby. I was half expecting Mads Mikkelsen’s character, Cliff, to be made of rock. Death Stranding wields metaphor like a cudgel and beats you over the head with it. Sam Bridges, the man who’s travelling the world to connect people, has aphenphosmphobia - the fear of being touched. That’s just, like, so deep, man. Let me take another hit on this bong.For the most part, the story is overly complex nonsense. It’s a game of telling, not showing, where characters will stand and talk at you for full 30 minute stretches. In the opening three hours, you’re in control for a mere 30 minutes. At the end, there are back-to-back cutscenes that rival MGS 4’s ending. It goes back to attrition again, but this time it’s your attention span and not your stamina that’s being tested. The pre-release trailers and the discussion around them were ultimately far more interesting than what’s here, story-wise.When the cutscenes and endless exposition get out of the way, though, there’s an interesting, beautiful, unique, unfortunately repetitive game here. It’s a game I’m glad exists, even though I’m not entirely enamoured with it. Remember how MGS 5 had a secret cutscene that would only trigger if every single player in the entire world decided to get rid of their nukes in the online mode? It’s a continuation of that idea, with every action you make potentially impacting another player in their own journey. Before I give you an example, let me explain the basic mechanics.As mentioned, you stack yourself up with cargo. Depending on how you stack it, your weight shifts, though there’s an option to auto-optimise all cargo so you’ll just use that every time because why wouldn’t you? Sometimes you just need to get it from A to B. Sometimes you need to do it in a time limit. Sometimes there are further restrictions, such as carrying it by hand (manually keeping a trigger squeezed to keep hold), or keeping it flat. One side mission sees you literally delivering a pizza while it’s still hot and flat. You’re basically a Deliveroo employee at the end of the world.Once you’ve figured out how you want your cargo, you head off into the landscape. Like I said earlier, it’s Icelandic - the end credits show that they shot on location in Iceland - but it’s meant to be the US. It bears no resemblance at all to the US, except for how fractured it is and how it only takes 22 hours to get a gun. There are rivers to cross, mountains to pass, and basalt to trundle across. Different surfaces affect your balance in different ways, and it’s about finding the optimal route while maintaining your center of gravity. Take on too steep a slope and you’ll slip, damaging your cargo and traumatising Schrödinger’s tot in the process.You can actually plot your route by bringing up your map and drawing it out. Later, you can predict weather patterns such as wind and timefall - also known as rain, except this ages things and fucks up your cargo with prolonged exposure... a bit like a Hermes driver. You also have to decide whether you want to try to pass over obstacles - mountains, enemy camps, and more - or take an indirect, safer route. Often, this depends on the tools you have. If you have enough climbing anchors and extendable ladders, a mountain can be tamed. It’s that famous video game marketing line again: “You see that mountain over there? It’s a prick.”One huge river at the base of a waterfall was my personal nemesis. I had to clamber down a cliffside to reach it and it seemed impassable. I couldn’t build a bridge over it because I hadn’t extended the network that far yet, so I had to try to find another way around, ultimately scaling an almost sheer cliff to bypass it. Later, I came back to the river with zipline structures and built an easy way across, both for me and for any weary traveller who might come up against what I just suffered through.Once you make it to the end of a mission, you get rated for the route you took, the time it took you to complete, and the state of the cargo. You also accrue a currency called ‘likes’ through your endeavours, both from NPCs and other players who use your structures and vehicles. Similarly to social media ‘likes’, these don’t actually seem to serve any worth whatsoever, but they do make you feel warm and fuzzy inside. The rating system is similarly pointless, though occasionally it doles out some incremental upgrades to things such as balance and likes received. Unfortunately, there are a few occasions in the story where the rating system bumps up against the human drama - there’s nothing quite like getting an S Rank for incinerating a loved one.When you’re driving along a road you’ve built, or firing yourself through the air in a series of linked up sci-fi ziplines, Death Stranding nails its objective. You are rewarded for your patience, planning, and foresight. The issue is, the reward is the ability to skip the core gameplay as much as possible, to automate the walking through well-laid equipment. Later, you can even use robots to cover minor deliveries for you, too. It feels like it is building up to a big payoff towards the end, but it completely undermines itself once it gets there. Once you reach the west coast, you’re forced to head back east again. Only now, timefall storms have ruined all your equipment. Instead of this being an opportunity to marvel at your work and trace a route back through it, it’s just a 50 minute slog back to the other side of the map in a single mission.Death Stranding does have its moments, though. Because it’s mostly walking around a vast environment while listening to Hideo Kojima’s Spotify playlist, action sequences are extremely tense when they do happen. One of the main bands of enemies are Mules. These were Deliveroo drivers like you once, but they forgot the reason they were doing it and now they just steal shit and deliver it to themselves. They have beacons dotted around their camps that ping your cargo, then they head out in a van to mess you up.Combat is a simple, one button affair, though you can also launch luggage at peoples’ faces. Most of the time, it’s best to try to escape. In one such encounter, I ran through a wheat field like a Tory, dodging electrical spears as they rained in, escaping into a derelict barn up ahead. From there, I used a ladder to escape through the broken roof and dropped down behind them, stealing their vehicle and gunning it until its battery died. I’ve also crept into Mule camps and stolen cargo from under them, strangling dudes while concealed and using a harpoon gun to snatch goods away from distant tents. In the entire 44 hours I played, probably less than four of those hours were spent in action sequences like this.Elsewhere, you have to creep past the ghosts that appear in the rain, using your BB to sense them with a robotic arm attached to your suit. This is just a case of creeping slowly and changing direction as needed. Later, grenades and a melee stealth attack makes them almost pointless encounters - all the tension falls away. If you are grabbed, you enter a boss arena where you can throw grenades at an oil dog, oil whale, or oil squid while jumping over rooftops.At some specific story points, you’re whisked away to other places for exciting, one-off action sequences. These moments are huge standouts, but they come so late that I imagine a good portion of players would have fallen off by then. The same goes for some of the most interesting equipment - exoskeletons, a cargo carrier that you can ride like a snowboard, those ziplines, the harpoon gun, and more - which doesn’t come until you’re into the double digits.If you do manage to hold out, you will be rewarded with flashes of brilliance, it’s just that those flashes are buried as deep as the core story is buried in the endless dialogue. And as profound as it wants to be, this is still a game in which you can equip and unequip your penis so you can piss out Red Bull. The good stuff is waiting for you beyond that piss, beyond the shit grenades, beyond that Ride with Norman Reedus advert unceremoniously plastered into a game universe where I didn’t see a single television set. It’s just a test of attrition.Version tested: PS4 Pro. A review copy was kindly supplied by Sony.

Death Stranding is an anomaly in the video game industry. With AAA studios firmly entrenched, we seldom get to see a brand new studio like Kojima Productions get a blockbuster budget, A-list celebrity casting, and the backing of Sony for their first title. Of course, Hideo Kojima isn’t just any developer. He’s been involved in developing some of the most-lauded games in history throughout his 34-year career and is one of the most recognizable personalities in our industry. Death Stranding marks not only the new studio’s first production but also Kojima’s first game post-Konami.I’m not going to beat around the bush here. Death Stranding is a masterpiece. It melds the best of cinematic and gaming traditions to craft a country-spanning saga in a true epic. This is the pinnacle of gaming, and it feels like every title made before it was leading to Death Stranding. Some critics felt like Konami kept Kojima’s wilder ideas in check and that this game would be a disaster of half-baked concepts. If anything, Death Stranding is Kojima’s most cohesive game to date, and even though it does present a strange and at times, confusing scenario, by the end, everything makes sense. Despite the fantastical setting, its themes are very much grounded in the real world.Editor’s Note: Our embargo stated we could only cover story elements through Chapter 3 in our review. However, this review reflects our experience with the game in its entirety in general terms.The Death Stranding is a cataclysmic event that weakened the barrier between the world of the living and the dead. Much of humanity has been wiped out by the appearance of Beached Things (BTs). These creatures are the souls of the dead who have crossed over into our world. In addition to being invisible to a normal person, when a BT consumes a human body, it creates a voidout. These voidouts are a massive explosion that can be large enough to take out entire cities. This constant threat means that many large settlements have been wiped out without any warning. In addition to the danger of BTs, rain has turned into Timefall, which ages anything it touches. The hazards of the outside world mean that the remaining humans must cling to life in the remaining cities and shelters dotted throughout America, disconnected from each other.There does exist a small percentage of the population who display resistance to Timefall and who can sense the presence of BTs. You play as Sam Porter Bridges (Norman Reedus), one of these individuals. Sam, as his name suggests, is a porter, someone who delivers vital supplies between the remaining vestiges of society. As the nation’s infrastructure has collapsed, porters are essential to the survival of humanity, and Sam, in particular, is already lauded as one of the best when the game begins.Even though the United States of America has collapsed, some people wish to see the country reborn. Bridges is a company formed by the last President of the United States to reconnect the nation and establish the United Cities of America. Three years before the game begins, the foundations of this endeavor were laid by the first Bridges expedition. This group made it from the east to the west coast before separatists terrorists captured their leader, Amelie (Lindsay Wagner). Due to Sam’s prowess, and his relationship to the former president, he’s asked to complete the work of the first Bridges expedition. His mission is to network the cities and shelters of America to allow the new nation to be born.Along the way, a Bridge Baby (BB) acts as your partner. While Sam can sense BTs, he can’t see them and requires a connection to a BB to do so. These BBs are suspended between the world of the living and the dead as their mothers are brain dead. The environment in the pod simulates their mother’s womb. This tricks them into staying unborn, preserving the connection to their mother, and allows them to be portable without losing their ability to detect BTs. Sam and BB’s journey will have you learning the mysteries behind the Death Stranding and what it will take to save humankind from extinction.Sam’s overarching mission is to reconnect the splintered remnants of the former United States to form a new country, the United Cities of America. While the land between settlements is still fraught with danger and unclaimable at this time, the smattering of towns and individuals that remain have etched out a place where they can survive. However, to prosper, they need the benefits of the Chiral Network, which allows for the sharing of information at an instantaneous rate. It’s hoped that by uniting these disparate peoples with the network, that humanity can start to reclaim the knowledge they’ve lost as a result of the Death Stranding and prevent the extinction of our race.What makes Sam perfect for this job, besides having DOOMS and being a repatriate, is that he’s one of the best porters in the business. Since all logistical networks have broken down, all the cargo in the world of Death Stranding has to be shipped by hand. His previous experience means that Sam is already an expert at navigating the hazards of terrain and the threat of BTs. Of those available, he has the best chance of anyone of making it from the east coast to the west, connecting settlements on the way.Connecting places to the Chiral Network isn’t Sam’s only objective during Death Stranding. Bridges and the UCA have no qualms about putting him to work delivering essential goods as well. You’ll often find yourself carrying vital cargo in the course of the story since not many porters are confident enough to venture very far. As you connect the world and clear hazards, this changes, and you’ll see more of your porter comrades walking about delivering cargo.At its core, Death Stranding is about the threads that connect each of us. Each aspect of the game, be it the story, gameplay, or the Social Strand System, calls attention to the ties that bind us and the strength they give us. Kojima has stated the game is about the “rope” instead of the “stick.” It’s revolutionary in that it concentrates less on a traditional protagonist vs. antagonist plot structure and more on the aspects of connectivity and unity.Throughout the game, Sam’s journey reflects the larger picture. In the beginning, he has separated himself from the remains of society. His attitude and his Aphenphosmphobia (fear of being touched), reflect the world in which he lives. After the failure of the Bridges I expedition, the shattered nation lives in fear of Homo Demens. That terror manifests itself in many people as a reluctance to join the UCA. Through Sam’s hard work, these people start to realize the strength of togetherness, and through them, Sam begins to feel a connection to others as well.Death Stranding also examines the commoditization of people in the form of the Bridge Babies. In an early conversation with Deadman, we see that even though Bridges is altruistic, they fall into the trappings of seeing BBs as tools, not people. Sam’s growing affection towards his BB is warned off as being too sentimental. When Sam first receives his BB, it’s said to be behaving erratically and that most of them have to be “retired” after a year in service.The overriding message I took away from Death Stranding is that our connections make us who we are. Despite the pain, they can sometimes cause us; these strands between us are the source of our strength as a species. However, there’s a ton of allegory and subtext to decode in Death Stranding. This is the kind of game people will talk about for years as it will mean something a little different to everyone.Death Stranding sets a new bar in video game acting. With names like Norman Reedus (Sam), Mads Mikkelsen (Cliff), Guillermo del Toro (Deadman), Lea Seydoux (Fragile), Margaret Qualley (Mama), Lindsay Wagner (Bridget), and Nicolas Winding Refn (Heartman), this game might have the most traditional star power of any title to date. In addition to the prominent roles above, there are a ton of cameos in the game that will be a real treat for players.Where Death Stranding succeeds is that its cast meshes well. That might not have been the case, as Jesse Corti and Darren Jacobs do Del Toro and Refn’s vocals, respectively. Multiple actors per character lead to the complexities of having one actor mocap and another doing the lines. So, even though the main cast has Hollywood chops, the experience wasn’t what you’d get on a traditional sound stage. However, each scene comes off with the quality of a blockbuster. There’s not a weak performance in the bunch.Everyone did a fantastic job, but there are two actors I’d specifically like to acknowledge. Troy Baker is a veteran in the industry but is known primarily for voiceovers. In Death Stranding, he is the mocap actor, face, and voice for Higgs, one of the game’s main antagonists. Baker has done a tremendous job in his myriad of past roles, but I’m thrilled that Kojima gave him a chance to be the face, not just the voice of Higgs. He makes for a great villain, and there’s a ton of nuance in his performance that brings out the motivation and history of the character.The second performance that stuck out was that of Tommie Earl Jenkins as Die-Hardman. I can’t go into detail, but there’s one scene with him in this game that is mindblowing. I’d put it up against the best that cinema has to offer. You’ll know it when you see it, and I hope you get as much out of it as I did.One thing I do fear is that Norman Reedus won’t get enough credit for his role as Sam. Reedus is perfect for the role. Despite the similarities in tone, he’s not just playing Daryl Dixon again. Sam is a man of few words. Still, there’s just enough dialogue on his end to let the character blossom without causing too much of a disconnect with the player. My advice is to watch Reedus’ movement in cutscenes. While Reedus expertly delivers the dialog, his facial expressions and body language add a lot to the character and speak to his skills as an actor.You could describe the main gameplay in Death Stranding as the fetch quest taken to its pinnacle. After all, that’s what you do. You take item(s) from one place and deliver them to another. Players typically pan fetch quests severely, but I argue the quests themselves aren’t the problem most of the time. Instead, players hate fetch quests in a lot of games because of the context. In Death Stranding, you’re a porter; it’s your job to deliver packages. The post-apocalyptical framing gives you the necessary motivation to enjoy taking on orders and delivering cargo.Of course, it’s not quite as simple as just taking a box from one place to another. There are multiple mechanics in play that you have to take into account. Sam can only hold a certain weight. Some packages are fragile, have to remain cold, must be delivered in a certain amount of time, or must be kept upright. Terrain, BTs, and human enemies stand as obstacles. Sam has stamina and health that you have to regulate. All these things come together to make the simple idea of taking a box from one place to another compelling.Luckily, there are plenty of things that help you stack the odds of a successful delivery more on your side. Powered exoskeletons will help you lift more and preserve stamina at the expense of having a limited battery life. You’ll also gain access to vehicles like reverse trikes, which are nimble and quick, and trucks, which can haul massive amounts of cargo, but handle like a Ford Econoline.Delivering packages brings people into the fold of Bridges and the UCA. The more you provide to them, the stronger your connection will become, and they’ll help you with items and perks. To complete the game, you only have to do the essential, story-based deliveries. However, you also have the choice to take on standard deliveries, which will help you develop those connections. It’s great that the game lets you enjoy it at your own pace. The story is the main attraction here, but you’re free at several points to do your own thing.While the BTs, MULEs, and Homo Demens terrorists serve as conscious protagonists, your biggest enemy is the environment itself. Throughout Death Stranding, you’ll be carrying large amounts of cargo through untamed lands. The differing terrain and obstacles make every delivery a sort of puzzle. You have to take into account elevation, obstacles, and distance with each job you take on, and the varied landscape keeps you on your toes from beginning to end.Careful examination of your route is a must in Death Stranding. In the beginning, you have to get cargo from point A to point B with no strings attached. The routing tools in the game make setting up waypoints easy, and the map is 3D, so you can get a picture of how much elevation will change along your path. A straight line is seldom the best way to your target, so getting a handle on the terrain in your area of operation is a must to be a successful porter.If your load is light, you may want to try a direct approach to your goal. You can use ladders and rope to ascend and descend from height and forge a path where none is obviously available. The more cargo you stack on Sam, though, the harder the journey becomes. If you’ve loaded down with heavy materials, you’ll find that Sam’s balance may be too shaky to attempt a mountainous crossing. In this case, you’ll want to use your map and routing tools to plot a relatively flat course.Of course, the whole thing is made more difficult by the existence of Timefall, and the need to avoid BTs and human foes. When navigating areas with Timefall, your cargo takes steady damage, so the route that’s safest for your health isn’t always the safest for your delivery. This dynamic becomes even more complicated when you start getting specialty cargo. Some items that you’re asked to port have unique qualifiers that make your journey more difficult. For example, you’ll encounter medicine that you have to deliver within a time limit, fragile cargo that takes damage more rapidly, and some packages have even more strict requirements.Of course, as deliveries become more tricky, you’ll get more tools to help even the odds. Your first significant upgrade comes with the Power Skeleton, an exosuit that dramatically increases the amount you can carry and helps Sam keep balanced. Vehicles are available that help your mobility and cargo capacity tremendously. However, due to the foreboding terrain of the broken world, you’ll find the going tough if you try and motor your way everywhere.One of the best aspects of Death Stranding is its freedom. Despite all the qualifiers above, you’re free to try and carry your cargo however you desire. The game is reminiscent of Breath of the Wild in that if you see it, you can more than likely scale it. If you want to try and climb, ladder, and rappel your way down the highest mountain, you can give it a shot. You might not be successful, but you might also find a quicker route to your objective.Death Stranding‘s environmental design excels in organically creating challenges through its landscape. The need to balance avoiding danger with keeping your cargo intact makes each delivery interesting. The environments vary throughout the game and keep you from getting bored of any particular geographical layout. Few game worlds are as expansive as the one found here while also remaining dynamic enough for the long distances between settlements and points of interest to not feel like filler.The land isn’t the only foe you have to deal with in Death Stranding. Your most dangerous enemies are BTs, which can appear in areas where it’s raining. Through your BB and Odrarek radar, you can detect the normally invisible Gazer BTs, allowing you to either sneak past them or fight them. As long as you stay quiet and keep your distance, Gazers aren’t too hard to slip by. Once they detect you, though, they’ll begin pursuit. They’re quick, but you still have a chance to avoid them if you keep an eye on the handprints that mark their tracks, hold your breath, and quietly move away.However, if a BT grabs you, it will cover the ground in a tar-like substance and summon help to try and pull you in. If you get pulled in, it’ll drag you to an arena-type location where you’ll have to fight a large BT. If you win this fight, the Timefall in the area will stop, and you can continue on your way. If it eats you, it’ll cause a voidout explosion that will render the surrounding area impassable. This obstacle can make already tricky navigation even harder and will destroy any cargo caught up in the blast.As always, humanity is divided, and you’ll face plenty of opposition from people in addition to BTs. These enemies primarily take the form of MULEs, ex-porters who have become addicted to the rush of the delivery and who steal cargo to sate their appetites. These individuals don’t kill, but they will attack you and attempt to take your cargo.Death Stranding encourages a non-lethal playthrough. Not only is it seen as immoral to kill MULEs because they’re suffering from mental illness, but a dead body creates an immediate and tremendous threat. When people die, left alone, they necrotize and become BTs. Even more dangerous is when a BT comes in contact with a dead body. This contact can create a massive void out which can level an entire city. The one true game over state in Death Stranding occurs when a non-repatriate (anyone but Sam in practice) dies, and the body comes in contact with a BT. The resulting detonation is enough to wipe out vast swathes of the map, which means you automatically fail in your mission to reunite America and establish the UCA.However, this game is about freedom, so you can utilize lethal force against other humans. If you do so, you’ll need to use an incinerator to burn the body before a BT can come in contact with it, or it can necrotize. A trip to the incinerator usually involves a considerable detour, and it drives home the consequences of taking a life.The multiplayer aspect of Death Stranding is like nothing seen before. It’s simple in concept, but revolutionary in execution and bridges the divide between single-player and multiplayer games. When you enter a region for the first time, you’re on your own, but as soon as you connect it to the Chiral Network, something amazing happens.In regions connected to the Chiral Network, you’ll see the handiwork of other players appear. You’ll see roads start to form in places that multiple players have passed through and be able to take advantage of structures that have been built by those who passed through before you. You can leave signs to warn other players of BTs or show some encouragement. All of this happens asynchronously. While other players never actually appear physically in your game, you can go through all of Death Stranding and see the path others have taken.The effect the Social Strand System has on your game is compelling. For example, ziplines can be used to traverse the world quickly. However, you must place them within 300 meters of each other. To build a path using these ziplines takes a lot of time and resources, so by yourself, it would be a colossal chore to set them up. However, by utilizing other players’ ziplines, you can much more easily fill in the blanks and create a vast network that speeds up travel tremendously.It’s this feeling of working together that makes the Social Strand System so amazing. People can pitch in resources to upgrade structures or rebuild a derelict highway network. It plays into the game’s theme of social connectivity and makes the whole world feel much more dynamic. Players can even reward each other with likes to show their appreciation of a particular sign or structure. It pushes you to look at what you’re doing in the game with a broader scope. I found myself building things or placing ladders and anchors in places I thought it would help people the most instead of just plopping them down wherever.I can see the Social Strand System being something that gets widely copied. While Death Stranding is ostensibly a single-player game, it adds that social dynamic that solo gaming typically lacks. Of course, you can turn the whole thing off if you choose and play the game entirely alone. However, it’s one of the unique aspects of Death Stranding, so I encourage everyone to give it a shot.We’re coming up on the end of the eighth generation of consoles, and we’re starting to see them pushed to their limits. I played mainly on a PS4 Pro on a 55-inch LG B8P OLED TV, and I found performance to be excellent. The game seems to target 30 fps and hits its mark 95% of the time. I did notice some slowdown in areas with a lot of player-generated structures during Timefall storms. It never gets super chopping, but you can tell the PS4 Pro is having a hard time with it. I also tested the game on a base model PS4 at 1080p and didn’t notice any massive drop in quality. Framerate on the base PS4 kept up with its big brother, and the game maintained much of its graphical allure.Death Stranding is a beautiful game. The terrain, models, textures, and effects are all top-notch. As the game is (currently) a PlayStation exclusive, you can tell the team was able to optimize it to use the PS4’s strengths and negate its weaknesses. I did find the use of fog to be a bit overwhelming at times, but there is a story-based reason for it (Timefall), which keeps it from being too jarring. I also didn’t notice much texture pop-in, which is surprising as you can get up to a pretty good clip on the reverse trike. I figured when I topped out on the trike, I’d start to get that muddy look you get when the PS4 can’t load the high-res stuff fast enough, but I was pleasantly surprised.The soundtrack for Death Stranding has been hyped, and for good reason. The melancholy sound of Low Roar punctuates some of the games more poignant moments, and other big names like Major Lazer contributed as well. However, I’m not sure if this is just a problem I had, or it’s widespread, but when a song would pop on, it would be almost too low to hear. I played on a 5.1 surround sound system and messed around with the settings both in-game and on my A/V receiver to try and fix the issue. However, I never did find the right balance to be able to hear the music during those moments without the other sound effects blasting my eardrums.One of the things that make Death Stranding is so impressive is just how well done it is as a whole. Everything fits together to create a fantastic experience, and no one aspect detracts from another.Each element feeds into the overall theme of connectivity. The story, the gameplay loop of deliveries, the Social Strand System, all of these reinforce the central idea that each of the strands that ties us together gives us strength. The genius of Kojima comes through in little aspects like the fact that a major story element is what encourages non-lethal combat (reinforcing the rope vs. stick themes) and not just some arbitrary rule.Death Stranding‘s excellence is due in part to its cohesion. Everything about it makes sense in the context of the game’s world. There’s no weird, out of place mechanics that take you out of the experience. There are no microtransactions, herding you towards making a purchase. It’s a whole game, meaning there’s nothing that needs added or taken away to get the most enjoyment possible.All the above being said, there’s going to be people who don’t enjoy the product placement. Sam’s beverage of choice is Monster energy drink. He keeps a canteen that can filter any water in the game into Monster. He keeps Monster cans in his private room. There’s a lot of Monster here. Also, there’s some ad placement for Ride with Norman Reedus.I thought the product placement brought a bit of levity to the game. Having a Ride with Norman Reedus ad pop up on the bathroom door when Sam goes #2, complete with motorcycle noises, had me rolling the first time I saw it. The idea of Sam chugging Monster out of a canteen to refill his stamina is hilarious. That’s me, though. I think it’s done in a way that’s kind of like the part in Wayne’s World. It’s not subtle, but it’s not intrusive either. The game gets it out of the way early and does so in a manner that lets you get a few chuckles and probably helped out Kojima Productions. After all, even though Kojima is an industry legend, this is the studio’s first game. That production money has to come from somewhere.I also really appreciated how considerate the game is of your time. Death Stranding is a long game, and a story-only completion will take you roughly 30 hours if you throw the blinders on and power your way through. The available side content is entirely optional, and you can ignore it if you choose. If you decide only to take on the story content, you’ll be missing out on equipment that will make the game more enjoyable. You’ll also miss some of the backstory you get in emails and reports received by strengthening connection levels and seeking out memory chips. I’d rate a 100% completion would put you at around the 90-hour mark. I’ve personally put in 80 hours, and I’m still doing the last few things to platinum the game. Even after all that time, I’m still enjoying the ride.Death Stranding is one of the best games I’ve ever played. It’s smart, it’s well-produced, and it just feels good to play. It’s damn cool. I don’t think any other game made me think to myself, “Damn, that was powerful,” as many times as Death Stranding did. Sure, there’s a lot of games that have some point to make. I don’t want to downplay anyone else’s work. However, Death Stranding will get you thinking about some stuff. I’ve played through it twice, and there are still things I’m turning around in my head.It’s always struck me as weird that people look down on games as some “lesser” form of entertainment than books, TV, or movies. Death Stranding stands defiantly in the face of that attitude, and I’d put its story against anything that’s come out in the last decade. Sam’s journey is a true epic that spans the whole country, and it inspires the hell out of me.If there’s one game you should play this year, it’s Death Stranding. It’s a system seller, and I love it.10Jason Faulkner is Evolve Media's Senior SEO Editor.

Destructoid,"darkIt’s nigh impossible to do justice to Death Stranding in just a few paragraphs. You’ve seen the promos, the famous faces, the web of intrigue spun by industry veteran Hideo Kojima; and either checked in or checked out of this hotel of madness.So let’s try to understand it together with a full review, shall we?Death Stranding (PC, PS4 [reviewed])Developer: Kojima ProductionsPublisher: SonyReleased: November 8, 2019 (PS4) / Summer 2020 (PC)MSRP: $59.99One of the first things you do in Death Stranding is enter your birthday, which allegedly impacts gameplay by influencing your “DOOMS” rating. Yes, this is a Hideo Kojima joint — strap in, if you haven’t already.While I’ll refrain from diving too deeply into the narrative, suffice to say there’s a quiet (ha) beauty to it amid all of the “delivery babies that spot shadow beasts” absurdity. It looks and sounds as damn fine as coffee on a PS4 Pro, with a rousing lead performance from Norman Reedus as professional “The Legend” delivery man, Sam Porter Bridges. That beauty isn’t so quiet on a technical level, as Kojima and his team have been toiling away for years with their Decima engine: it paid off.Not just in a “you can see the pores on the actor’s faces” kind of way that wowed everyone back in 2011 when L.A. Noire hit the scene, but in a meaningful fashion; with all the wild bells and whistles that go with something extracted from the mind of Kojima. I love Reedus’ grunting, raw, and primal delivery in nearly everything he does: Death Stranding included. Léa Seydoux is mesmerizing as “Fragile,” who has her name emblazoned all over her outfit just in case you forget her moniker. Hell, just about every cast member, big or small, feels essential to the experience and dedicated to their role. You haven’t lived until you’ve seen Mads Mikkelsen in a Santa hat shouting “ho ho ho!”Unless you’re a huge Kojima nut you probably came here for an actual gameplay discussion, so let’s go to it. No bullshitting around: you run about for most of the game as a postman in a quest to reunite America by reactivating internet terminals. You can scan for packages — that’s what the fancy arm-like radar thing does — jump, grab stuff, and occasionally fight.It doesn’t take an hour and a half to get started like some Metal Gear Solid games. You’re grabbing packages — and bodies — and confronting the main baddies (shadow things) very quickly. Your main job is to regulate Sam’s blood and stamina gauges, and not slip and slide down hills or off cliffs by bracing yourself with L2/R2, even with a comical amount of cargo on your back (I have trained for this my entire life). Oh and avoid those menacing “BTs” — horrifying creatures that you can’t clearly see that figuratively drag you to hell — plus human threats. No big deal.Much of Death Stranding is spent finding the best way to reach a destination (through arduous rivers and mountains), taking in the sights as you wait for another [good] bridge cutscene. No, there aren’t frequent boss fights, but they do exist and are pretty exhilarating, if not simplistic. No, everything isn’t fully explained in the end. Unless we get a sequel, that’s par for the course for Kojima — feel free to cheer or sigh here. Whether or not you’re okay with the whole “auteur” excuse, Death Stranding as a whole is a little too long (in all it’s about 30-50 hours, critical to 100%, respectively). I could have done without a large busywork section a little past the halfway mark (in which you need to wait until your baby is fully operational again by doing required side missions), and in some cases, the map is slightly too sprawling for how little there is to do in a few zones. It can be exhausting and should be a red flag for a certain kind of person, but in my case, never to the point of giving up.The way the delivery concept works is a bit weird and clunky, but fun in the sense that you can fully customize how you want to approach the game. Sam can strap anything he wants to his back, but it can get really silly when you need to carry critical mission objectives. It’s actually more efficient to place items like ladders, anchors, weapons, grenades, and other trinkets onto your body directly like a Transformer, or on vehicles. Sam can carry two shoulder items, two pieces of gear on his thigh, an exoskeleton (with various bonuses like higher capacity loads, speed, or terrain control), gloves, and several backpack-like pockets.You can manually do this every time you come across a new item or take another quest, or click an auto-optimization button, it’s your choice. Yes, there is a dedicated urination option — which directly impacts a lore-based concept — and weapons like traditional lethal and non-lethal weaponry, though guns don’t come into play until roughly halfway in. Eventually you can unlock fast travel and use light hand-to-hand combat that doesn’t even remotely resemble something like CQC. It’s esoteric, but in the end a very traditional action-adventure in many respects.Of course there’s cinematic flair in-between all that walking and plenty of existential dread. There’s a lot of tension in this completely new, unique world, especially since you can hear the unsettling voice of the BB (the baby device on your person that helps detect BTs) through the DualShock 4 speaker, or the TV if that gets annoying. You really have to hand it to Kojima: even if you hate his games, they aren’t quite like anything else. Some don’t see him as the genius he’s now known as by his fanbase, but like David Lynch, his weirdness (and their fondness for toys as adult men) resonates with me directly.Speaking of, death is also a whole…thing in Death Stranding. I mean, it’s in the name. The first time I died was at the very beginning after an errant jump off a cliff. From there, I had to reunite with my body through a 30-second minigame. I know people are going to hate it: An artsy death world is a game mechanic and you are a postman. I want to make that absolutely crystal clear before someone claims I called this the next Metal Gear Solid. Tactical espionage action this is not.It can also be frustrating. Delivering packages will make you “very popular indeed” according to an early on-screen message, which tells you absolutely nothing about what that entails. There’s an in-game loading screen tip that explains three esoteric concepts all at once. Kojima also seems to be commenting on the current social landscape (he’s an Instagram fiend!), with “likes” being doled out for deliveries, and you can vaguely level-up, though completing critical missions and earning new blueprints for gear is far more impactful.There are so many menus and controls that it can get crazy. To jump into a structure submenu, you have to hold (not press) the options button until it shows up. Building structures is a very finicky venture, as you need to figure out the proper placement for it and have all of the required materials on hand. When placing a bridge is stressful, you know someone did something horribly right or horribly wrong depending on your point of view. This savagery has a point though with the game’s very light but welcome “we’re all in this together” multiplayer.You can create open-world signs for people to “like” or warn them of impending hazardous areas just like a lot of other modern action-adventure games, but Death Stranding takes it a step further. Bridges or other big structures can just show up in other worlds (or yours) because you or another player built them. You can reap the benefits of donated items in your mailbox from a community of other real players in a constantly connected asynchronous universe, which was live and very active even during the course of this review period. There is a limit on how many players can connect (and your entire real estate won’t be taken up by building after building), but I’ve always been matched up.I can’t count how many times my bacon has been saved by a player-built safehouse or a battery charging post that provided respite. The optional (you can play offline) community-driven idea propels the game forward in a way, but the world itself isn’t a complete mystery.There is a good amount of exposition that straight-up tells you how the universe works. Concepts like aphenphosmphobia are a lot easier to relate to than “La-li-lu-le-lo,” as a full layer of political intrigue is chopped off in favor of a more human angle. Kojima also hasn’t lost sight of his cinematic roots, providing four levels of difficulty, including “very easy,” which I’ll transcribe right now: “Recommended for those with little or no action game experience. Gameplay at this difficulty is only very mildly challenging, allowing almost anyone to make it to the end of the story.” Emphasis mine! What a subtle dunk. As usual I forged ahead on normal mode, but at any point, you can swap. Accessibility!Death Stranding is not the overly-strange inaccessible walled garden the marketing has made it out to be. It’s weird, don’t get me wrong! But anyone with a surface-level understanding of surrealism in art should be able to acclimate to what is essentially a playable Hollywood production.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]GreatImpressive efforts with a few noticeable problems holding them back. Won't astound everyone, but is worth your time and cash.
