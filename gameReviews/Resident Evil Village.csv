Link Official site (opens in new tab)Resident Evil Village begins with a scene of domestic bliss, as our hero Ethan Winters (returning from Resident Evil 7) and his wife Mia prepare dinner and look after their newborn baby, Rosemary. Then something bad happens—I won't say what, because it's pretty shocking—and soon Ethan finds himself lost in an isolated village in a snowstorm, searching for his kidnapped child. It's a sharp, sudden intro, but an effective one, immediately setting the stakes high and establishing Village's brutal, sadistic tone.It's never explicitly stated where the village the game takes its name from is located, but a few clues point towards it being nestled somewhere in the wintry mountains of Romania. The village itself is a scrappy, ramshackle scattering of wood and brick houses, farmer's fields, and the occasional church. Over it looms a gothic castle with immense spires stretching into the mist, and there are also traces of ancient ruins, suggesting a long and strange history. It's a magnificent setting, dripping with atmosphere, menace, and mystery—and a place I wanted to explore every dark, dingy corner of.Ethan is a boring guy who always seems confused about what's going on, and never has anything interesting to say. This makes him a slightly unremarkable protagonist, but his extreme normality does heighten the eccentricity of the village's many oddball residents. The previous game's Baker family were a relatively grounded bunch of ghouls, but here Capcom has seriously ramped up the monstrousness of its antagonists. As Ethan hunts for Rose, he goes up against an impossibly tall and glamorous vampire, a weird mutant fish-man, a killer porcelain doll, and other assorted weirdos.What I love about Village is that it never settles on being just one kind of horror game. Each villain's lair features a very different take on the genre, from breathless, action-packed survival against hordes of enemies, to a more slow-burning, psychological brand of horror. It's a game overflowing with cool, memorable ideas, constantly inventing clever, surprising new ways to raise your heart rate and jolt you out of your comfort zone. And it manages to keep this up for pretty much the entire duration of the game.What I love about Village is that it never settles on being just one kind of horror gameEach section is so wildly different, Village almost has the feel of a horror anthology. Admittedly, this can make it feel inconsistent at times, as if all the parts are flimsily strung together. You often get the sense that Capcom had the ideas for the game's many brilliant set-pieces first, then decided how to connect them all together at the last minute. But it's worth it for the variety this approach offers. You genuinely never know what fresh weirdness the developer is going to throw at you next.This not only makes this the most varied Resident Evil to date, but arguably the scariest. One of the best examples of this is the mansion of Donna Beneviento, a dollmaker and one of the village's rulers. In her creaking, dusty old house—which is littered with dozens of eerie, black-eyed dolls in various states of disrepair—you're forced through a series of brilliantly constructed moments of understated, excruciatingly tense horror, culminating in an encounter that might well be the scariest single moment in Resident Evil history.In another section you're hunted by Lady Dimitrescu, the aforementioned lofty vampire. Her 15th Century castle is an opulent labyrinth of ornate, gilded corridors and shadowy drawing rooms, lavishly decorated and softly lit by candles. It's an incredibly atmospheric setting, and the imposing Lady D bearing down on you (crouching to squeeze through doorways that are much too small for her) is thrillingly nerve-wracking. As she pursues, you have to hunt for objects to unlock the main gate, which involves some light puzzling and, in true Resi style, mentally mapping the building.Castle Dimitrescu is perhaps the best showcase of Resident Evil's impressive visuals—but the entire game is just obscenely pretty. The environments are richly detailed and stunningly lit, with a tangible layer of grime and texture to every object and surface. It runs smoothly, even at high resolutions, and raytracing makes for some gorgeous lighting and reflections. The character models are also spectacular, with expressive, convincing animation bringing the cast horribly to life. The English voice acting is a little hammy, but for the most part this suits these absurd, egomaniacal characters.The castle and dollmaker's mansion are among the series' most memorable set-pieces. But I do wish they had squeezed more out of some of them. In one sense, I do appreciate how Capcom resists the urge to milk its ideas dry, enthusiastically tossing them aside to present something new to the player. This keeps things feeling fresh and unpredictable throughout. But occasionally I'd reach the end of one of these sequences and think ""Is that it?"" Sometimes I just wish the game would give me more time to soak it all in before shoving me through to the next room of the haunted house.Elsewhere, the horror is more immediate. While Resident Evil 7 had one type of regular enemy—the sludge-like Molded—Village features an array of savage horrors called Lycans. These feral, snarling creatures come in various forms, and you have to regularly switch up your tactics to fight them. The standard grunt Lycan isn't overly powerful, but they're agile and athletic, able to leap at you suddenly from a distance and clamber up walls and ladders, which makes for some entertainingly dramatic, fast-paced battles.I found the regular Lycans too cartoonishly werewolf-like to really be scared by them, but later iterations are much more intimidating. There are some really messed up creatures in the latter half of Village, including twitching biomechanical horrors with drills for arms, guys with chunks of rusty metal screwed to them as makeshift armour, and other similarly grim examples of Clive Barker-esque body horror. It makes those sentient blobs of black slime from RE7 seem very lame in comparison.There are some really messed up creatures in the latter half of VillageWhile much of Village takes place in tight, narrow spaces, it sometimes opens up into larger arenas built with combat in mind. Here you'll find explosive barrels to lure groups of enemies towards, roofs to climb, houses to slip into, and furniture to drag across doorways to stem the flow of Lycans. These sections are enjoyably frantic, but are less interesting than the moments when you don't have to fire your weapon much, or at all. Village is a decent first-person shooter, but whenever Capcom focuses on atmosphere and tension over action, it's a better game.However, the developer seems to have almost entirely lost interest in puzzles. There are a few in Village, but they're extremely easy, with solutions that are always staring you right in the face. As someone who has always enjoyed the arcane, convoluted puzzles in Resident Evil games, I find this slightly disappointing. It does make for a pacier game, with fewer interruptions to the flow of exploration and combat. But I like those interruptions, and I feel like Village could have benefited from being a little more cerebrally taxing. I didn't get stuck once in the 11 hours it took me to finish it.Ethan has very few allies in the village, and they tend to die horribly not long after meeting him. But a mysterious character known as The Duke is a constant friendly presence. He's a merchant with a curiously enigmatic personality, and always seems to be one step ahead of you. Turn a corner in a new area and you'll find him there, quietly puffing on a cigar, eagerly awaiting your coin. He sells weapons, ammo, crafting blueprints, and other helpful stuff, and will buy any treasure you happen to pick up—including the crystalised remains of bosses, which always fetch a tidy price.The Duke can also upgrade weapons and turn raw ingredients into meals that permanently increase your health, defence, and movement speed. As you explore the village you'll encounter a range of wildlife including pigs, sheep, chickens, and the occasional fish splashing around in a stream. Shoot them and they'll drop meat, which The Duke can then use to whip up one of these tasty stat-boosting feasts. This is one of several optional quests and distractions, which help Village feel slightly less linear than the last game, even if the story does follow a strictly prescribed path.Running into The Duke gives me the same feeling of relief I get when I find a safe room in the old Resident Evil games. It's a chance to breathe, regroup, tidy up your cluttered inventory, and save at the nearby typewriter. Yes, typewriters are back, but you don't need ink ribbons to use them. Inventory management is an important consideration in Village, but limited to weapons, ammunition, and health items. There are no magic item boxes in this game, so if a weapon or some other bulky object is taking up too much space, you'll either have to sell it or pay to increase the size of your inventory.Important items like door keys and objects needed to solve puzzles don't take up any inventory space, and are stored in a separate, bottomless menu—which is one major way Village streamlines the classic Resident Evil formula. Treasure doesn't take up any inventory space either, so you can carry around as many crystal skulls as you like. I must admit, I miss the old system, where picking up a key might mean sacrificing a weapon or some other helpful item. But it does mean less time spent in menus or backtracking to find item boxes, which, again, increases the overall pace of the game.Compared to RE7, Village has a much more interesting structure. A large, open square in the centre of the village acts as a hub, from which all the major locations in the game branch off, locked by a series of keys. This is a safe zone, similar to the main hall of RE2's police station, and you revisit it frequently. Here you get easy access to The Duke, as well as the entrances to each villain's lair. The village is also hiding several optional areas, which contain extra story details, rare treasure, and minibosses. This rewards you for taking the time to wander off the beaten path and explore.Although Resident Evil 7 had the feel of a soft reboot, only lightly touching on the series' larger mythology, Village contains some major revelations that impact every game in the series in hindsight. If you're a fan of these stories and you feel like the last few games have been light on new information about this universe and characters, Village will not disappoint. But the important thing is that it's not one of those Resi sequels that bombards you with dumb new lore. These revelations are big and important, but sit quietly in the background, letting Ethan's story stand on its own.Finishing the story unlocks a store where you can purchase a selection of extras with an in-game currency earned by unlocking achievements. These include a return of The Mercenaries, a fan favourite arcade/time attack mode. In Village's take on it, you can buy items and weapons from The Duke between rounds. But otherwise it remains faithful to the mode popularised by Resi 4. There's a New Game+ mode too, which lets you carry your weapons and character upgrades over to a second, harder playthrough.Village can occasionally feel like half a dozen different horror games jammed together. But the strength and variety of its ideas, the quality of the art direction, and its darkly evocative atmosphere more than make up for it. It's a bold and experimental horror game, but also one that leans into the series' past glories—particularly Resident Evil 4. There's a lot of Mikami's 2005 reinvention here, from the enigmatic merchant and weapon upgrades, to the rural setting and corrupted villagers. But ultimately, Village is its own game with its own identity, and the elements it borrows from earlier sequels never define it. This is a quality horror game in its own right, and proof Resident Evil still has the power to thrill, surprise, and scare 25 years on.A grimly beautiful collection of killer horror set-pieces, with some of the most memorably grotesque enemies in Resi history.If it’s set in space, Andy will probably write about it.

Resident Evil Village,Vikki Blake,Eurogamer,https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-05-05-resident-evil-village-review-an-entertaining-if-uneven-slice-of-horror,"Lycan subscribe.Everywhere I look, the empty gaze of one - two, three, five; oh my god, dozens of - glassy eyes are staring back, watchful and hateful. They chitter merrily to each other as I tear through rooms, desperately seeking the outlier secreted somewhere in the mass of giggling, squirming china dolls. Twice I run out of time - I'm so panicked, I don't even see the thing when it's right in front of me - and then they swarm me, lifting horrifying, segmented appendages to attack, and I properly scream this time, loud enough that my next-door neighbour hears me via an open window and hesitantly knocks on the door to ensure I'm okay.
It's not entirely Capcom's doing that I'm a screamy, jumpy mess - I effed myself up watching the (terrible) 1987 horror Dolls when I was still in junior school and my fear of those frozen china faces has never quite left me - but it's as though the developer reached into my brain, jotted down my worst nightmare, stuck it in Resident Evil Village, and then forced me to relive it. 
It is to the developer's credit, however, that this neat, traditional home is such a triumph of understated spooks and masterful level design. Later, when I'm lost within a labyrinthine factory that long outstays its welcome, I'll realise how unusual - and special - House Beneviento is; even if I wasn't quite able to appreciate it while I was trapped there, racing through shadowy corridors and frantically hunting for a place to hide. It's terrifyingly brilliant and brilliantly terrifying in equal measure.
Village picks up where RE7 left off, and we reprise our role of Ethan Winters, he of I-can-staple-my-severed-hand-back-on-with-chem-fluid fame. I'm not going to go into any of the specifics because even a light tease will spoil not just the story but the pacing, too, but just like RE7, Village is very much a game of two halves, and that's not necessarily a good thing. It's a shame, really, because the first half of Village is bloody spectacular - literally.
Early locations like House Beneviento are Resident Evil Village at its best. Later, when you're touting a small armoury and blasting away wave after wave of Lycans - a fancy word for werewolves - you'll forget how small and weak you felt in earlier segments. It's not that I stomped through the entire game feeling bigger and stronger than I was - your supplies are rare and not always easy to spot, so, observing full survival horror tradition, Ethan is often on the cusp of running out of supplies and crafting ingredients - but there's a surprising turn in the final act that means the game you finish is very different to the one you began. 
That said, I found Village's combat less vexing than its predecessor, and its boss fights are considerably less complex, although I'll leave it to you to decide if that's a good thing or a bad one. Yes, there are some tanky fights - even though I attack as much as I can with my knife to preserve ammo, I still often found myself running low - and I feel there's a stronger emphasis on combat this time around, perhaps closer to RE5 and 6 than its immediate predecessor. But only late-game - and you'll understand what I mean by that when you get there yourself - did I feel stacked to the point of invincibility.
It should come as no surprise, then, that there's a good array of weapons, which is just as well, as you'll get to use all of them - even the guns you don't like so much - due to limited ammo. A mysterious travelling merchant, Duke, pops up at strategic points along the way with supplies, upgrades, and more, to help keep Ethan in tip-top shape, and even though ammo is scarce, you'll nonetheless spend as much time in your inventory moving stuff around to maximise space - pro tip: upgrade your inventory at every opportunity you get - as you do taking down agitated werewolves. And while, ostensibly, less bloodthirsty players can opt for flight instead of fight, my experience of the narrow village streets and castle corridors suggests this might be harder in practice than in theory. 
Sadly, there's no opportunity to head back to mop up missing recipes or collectables, either. Once the game is over, it's over, so if you're a completionist, all I can say is: slow down. It's not super long - I finished the campaign in 12.5 hours on standard difficulty, and a lot of that time was spent happily backtracking to find missing items and/or considering puzzle solutions (two, in particular, had me stuck for an embarrassingly long time) - but it's so, so frustrating that once you hit a point of no return, there's no way to get back. Exploring the titular Village itself is such a pleasure - it's full of wonderful environmental storytelling and has so many secrets to share with you! - it's such a shame you're denied the chance to revisit once your war with the Four Lords of the Village is over.
The further into the story you progress, though, the weaker it becomes, as though the beginning and end were designed by two entirely different teams. I know there's always an element of this in all Resident Evil games - RE7's sudden pivot to the tanker section was so unexpected it gave me whiplash - but this disconnect impacts both momentum and atmosphere. Yes, there's plenty of diversity in its environments - you'll not just visit the village and Castle Dimitrescu but also a sunken town and a killing factory and an abandoned mine, amongst other places - but all four Lords are not created equally, which means your time with them won't feel equally validating, either. Some are terrifically frantic scrambles, but others are so weak and frustrating, they occasionally feel more like time-wasters than meaningful encounters.
There are more annoyances, too. Sometimes the button prompts don't pop when they should, which is frustrating at best and lethal at worst. Other times, the signposting is so weak, it's hard to know what you're meant to do next, and I wasted a lot of my precious ammo shooting invincible creatures that at the time, I didn't know were invincible. Despite its frosty exteriors, Resident Evil Village is a beautiful place with plenty of opportunities to abuse your screenshot button, but Capcom won't let you take in-game snaps (on PS5, anyway) unless it's via its own Photo Mode system which stamps every vignette with an ugly copyright notice - that is if it lets you take a screenshot at all. And no matter how much I increased the brightness in-game or on my TV, it was still too bloody dark to see what was going on half the time.
Sackable offences? Of course not. And for all these flaws, Resident Evil Village was a thrilling adventure that kept me hooked from beginning to end, despite its jarring twists and turns. But the delightful level design isn't enough to mitigate a strange, unsatisfying, plothole-ridden story, and that bizarre final act ultimately sullies what is an otherwise terrifyingly good horror romp.

Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy.I feel like I want to give Resident Evil Village a running commentary of scores, such is the range and variety of its sections: 8, 9 (...Jesus, maybe a 10?), 8, 7, 6… There's so much going on but it chops and changes from beat to beat in such a way you can almost see the line between sections. Most noticeably it feels like there's a real difference between the first and second half. The opening is strong, clever, and fun - full of atmosphere and intrigue as you explore (and features a part that's probably one of the best stand-alone horror levels of the year). While the latter half veers into 'okay' territory, with some combat slogs, a boss fight that's a bit of a stretch even by Resident Evil standards and, while it's still good, it lacks the same spark and craft as the beginning. Release date:May 7, 2021
Platform(s): PS5, PC, PS4, Xbox Series X, Xbox One 
Developer:  Capcom
Publisher:  CapcomTo be clear, I enjoyed Resident Evil Village, as when it's great it's on fire. Characters are entertaining, there are some lovely 'holy shit what?' twists and turns, while exploring and unlocking the titular village is satisfying. But it does feel like a mishmash of directions. Early rumors suggested this started life as Resident Evil Revelations 3, before being reworked and upgraded to a Resident Evil 7 sequel, and having finished it I can believe that. The change between the first and second halves feels like a gradual drift from the sinister tone of the last game, to Revelations' louder, fun action movie vibe. That said I'm going to have to try to explain as much as I can without spoiling anything, because Capcom has impressively managed to keep about 90% of the game secret and only shown off the first maybe three or four hours. Almost everything I could mention that isn't Vampire Mommy or a werewolf will be a surprise I don't want to ruin. It opens strong as you explore the village via a dark forest full of things just out of sight. Something terrible has happened, with body parts and blood scattered like gory narrative confetti. This 'what the hell is going on?' stage is great, as the world does most of the talking and it's a beautiful place to explore. Even the most mundane bits of table crap and floor detritus in the village are incredibly crafted - I spent far too long just looking at clutter. 'Monsters? Yeah, there's a bunch out there somewhere but just look at this dirty table with a rusty pot on it.' The level of detail is never less than impressive - Castle Dimitrescu alternates between the fading finery of its halls, and crumbling dank cellars and dungeons. I don't think I passed a single shelf in the game without looking it over. It's these opening sections that feel the most well crafted and balanced. The monsters in the castle besides Dimitrescu and her daughters are the ghoulish female Moroaică (Dimitrescu eats men and enslaves women apparently). They're creepy, lumbering, and slow - the threat mainly coming from your own mistakes. The ability to guard against attacks and follow up with a kick to push back enemies adds an interesting dimension to combat and means it's not just about deciding between shooting and backing off. The Lady of the house and her children, when they appear, are more of a set piece adding brief, intense, structured encounters to vary the mix. Like the best Resident Evil moments the castle is a sort of danger-filled puzzle box you crisscross and backtrack through to open up new areas and progress further. For most of the game this is true of the village itself too. As well as the story push to new places, there are plenty of secrets and extras to find off the prescribed path as you expand the map. I spent a good deal of time exploring and retreading roads with new keys and tools, and was usually surprised with additional monsters, resources, cash, or crafting materials. Resident Evil games are always about backtracking to open up locked areas, but this is the first time it's almost dabbled with an open-world feel. It's not strictly free-roaming but the village is a constantly expanding hub you return to. Without spoiling anything, there are several areas you have to visit to progress the story, and each is a finite, self-contained section in its own right. Castle Dimitrescu, and a location that comes after, are amazing, incredible high points - clearly lavished with attention and love that shines through as you play. The second place you visit is amazing, and hands down one of the best horror moments I've played in a long time. After this, however, things get a little more perfunctory. The third area is fine, although it's a bit light on any real depth and oddly paced so that it feels like it's over fast and skipped bits without telling you. The fourth area is good, and features one of the more interesting characters, but it gets a little monotonous with its 'thing'. There's more after that, obviously, but I'm not going to say anything. The constant shifting of styles and ideas, while inconsistent, works well, and creates constant excitement about what's coming, even if it doesn't always hit the high notes reached elsewhere. The pacing does feel inconsistent though - depending on how much you explore between sections, key beats can feel weirdly short, or artificially extended. It's worth noting that it isn't the longest game however you play - even scouring for secrets, collectibles and completing just about everything on the map, my save only clocked in at 13 hours. I know someone else that took a more direct story route and completed it in six.Oddly, for a series known for its puzzles, it's the one area where the quality is consistently… low. Bar one brilliant set piece sequence most of the challenges feel phoned in - there's a treasure map that leads you to an obvious, completely unhidden locked gate you previously passed during a scripted sequence, while one puzzle literally has the solution next to it; not some enigmatic hint you have to decrypt, just the answer, next to the buttons you need to press. Most of what passes for puzzles boils down to finding something later you then take back to somewhere you were earlier. It's also a shame (for me at least) that this is one of the 'not a horror game' Resident Evils. There are scares and some lovely creepy bits, especially at the start, but Resident Evil Village is mostly a big shooty action game. After Resident Evil 7's creepy tension, Village's extended gun battles with crowds of werewolves feel brash and occasionally fumbling. Less is more works best: a few Lycans becomes an interesting and tactical tussle to survive - a massive pack of them is a pain. Later in the game, you'll end up fighting waves of Lycans. It's meant to be escalating a midpoint towards a sense of climax, but the incessant barrage is more wearing than anything else. The Resident Evil combat model has always been about feeling weak in the face of danger, so throwing you in what amounts to a furry Call of Duty section doesn't play to its strengths. There are also a few boss fights that don't feel like they were designed for first-person - there's a lot of running out the way of big telegraphed attacks in large open spaces where you're battling your limited movement more than the monster. Sprint is basically a light jog and doesn't have the zip to really get you clear of danger. Plus trying to avoid things means turning away from the threat, guesstimating when you're safe and then whipping the camera around to see what's going on. For one key battle in particular I spent most of my time with my back to an enemy because of the timing required to get clear of a near insta-kill attack. Despite some of the issues I've mentioned I enjoyed Resident Evil Village, I'm on a second playthrough already and it's still good. If I sound like I'm down on it in a few places it's only because the excellence of some parts only highlights some of the more ordinary moments. The first half is great, the characters are interesting throughout, and exploring and unraveling the location never gets old. It's only in the latter half where things start to alternate between some good bits, some fumbles, and at least one moment of 'oh my God, what?!' shark-jumping excess that wouldn't look out of place in a Fast and Furious trailer... It feels like a fun but flawed mix between the camp excess of older games, and the more modern feel of the last installment. One thought that kept popping into my head while I was playing was just remembering how good Resident Evil 7 was. I recently completed another playthrough in preparation for this (along with some Revelations and Veronica, just because) and number 7's reverse home invasion slasher terror is still up there as one of the greatest horror games of all time.

Resident Evil Village,Ben Reeves,Game Informer,https://www.gameinformer.com/review/resident-evil-village/resident-evil-village-review-painting-the-ghost-town-red,"Not all monsters hide in the shadows. Ethan Winters discovers this within minutes of setting foot in this isolated village at the foot of a medieval castle. The sun has barely burned off the morning mist when ravenous, fang-toothed horrors attack him. Resident Evil Village’s opening hour establishes an incredibly tense tone, weaving together moody, atmospheric horror with rollercoaster firefights that leave Ethan within an inch of his life. And, like an ultramarathon runner, Village maintains this thrilling pace until its closing credits.Ethan’s journey forces him to explore a ramshackle shantytown, blood-soaked wine cellars, and a creepy mansion littered with animated porcelain dolls. These locales are perfect backdrops for a series of blood-curdling encounters. My stomach lurched as a deformed baby-like mutation chased me through a dimly lit basement, and I had to stop and catch my breath after a harrowing shootout with a snarling truck-sized hound. Village’s environment and enemy design are superb, making it one of the scariest Resident Evil games to date.Ethan slowly amasses the usual assortment of shotguns, pistols, and grenade launchers to combat this assortment of otherworldly horrors. Village’s arsenal doesn’t hold many surprises, but the overall gunplay is more polished than what we had in its predecessor. Running from Village’s slow-marching enemies isn’t difficult, but navigating their flurry of fangs is still a thrill. Staying calm long enough to line up a series of headshots while these hordes bear down on your position is the true challenge, and I walked away from most encounters with a rush of adrenaline. A handful of other adversaries – such as a meme mistress Lady Dimitrescu – relentlessly hound Ethan throughout the game, much like RE 2’s Mr. X. You never know when one of these villains will stroll around a corner, which creates a palpable tension, but these sequences always eventually resolved themselves in an epic, resource-draining boss battle.When I wasn’t battling tooth and claw for my life, I was scanning every room from floor to ceiling, looking for more ammo, healing items, and other valuable tools. Like previous Resident Evil games, Village’s map does a stellar job communicating which rooms have been cleared out and which still contain a few hidden treasures. However, some items are better hidden than others. On the one hand, Village encouraged me to pour over its intricately detailed environments with a fine-toothed comb; I enjoyed most of these scavenger hunts, and checking a room off my map was always satisfying. On the other hand, a few items remained stubbornly hidden even after several minutes of scouring, so trying to find every item in every room became a little tedious. Fortunately, even a cursory search of each room yields enough gear to get you through the trials ahead.Developing a keen eye for detail is also vital for solving Village's handful of environmental puzzles. I love how these puzzles offer a much-needed tension release, and most of Village’s puzzles left me feeling clever. Unfortunately, a couple of puzzle solutions are obscured by fuzzy logic. For example, I had to brute force my way through one puzzle that involved rotating statues, because its clues were misleading. Even after I’d stumbled into the solution, it still took me a while to work out the underlying logic. Fortunately, Village doesn’t throw many puzzles your way, and most of them are satisfyingly simple, so speedbumps are rare.Resident Evil Village’s narrative is more compelling than I expected. Ethan is still a bit of a bland everyman, but his journey to rescue his daughter is full of wild characters and a handful of surprising moments. Village’s narrative was never the main thing driving me forward, but I’m glad to see that Capcom actually put some thought into this world, and a few of the late game twists have me genuinely excited to see where the series goes next.Resident Evil Village is an impressive package. I loved the recent remakes of Resident Evil 2 and 3, but I’m excited to see Capcom push the series forward again. Village expands on Resident Evil 7: Biohazard’s approach to first-person combat, offering a series of white-knuckle encounters that perfectly complement Capcom’s unnerving environmental design. Thankfully, Village’s amplified action doesn’t diminish its horror. If anything, Village maintains a sense of dread that few games can match. If you have the intestinal fortitude for intense terror, playing Resident Evil Village is a great way to check your pulse.

Resident Evil Village,Suriel Vazquez,Polygon,https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22420808/resident-evil-village-review-ps5-pc-xbox-series-x-one-ps4,"Filed under:And both will get your blood pumpingOne of my favorite moments in Resident Evil Village is small enough that I almost didn’t notice it. After defeating a boss to get the item I needed to move forward, I returned to the titular town for the fourth time, basking in the gorgeous streaks of sunlight that pelted the abandoned houses I would skulk around at dusk. As I did my rounds to see if any new items had cropped up since my last search, I noticed them: a couple of ominous black goats now grazing just outside the graveyard.There’s no cutscene that announces them, no shriek of a violin to indicate they’re supposed to scare you. They just kind of show up. They’re never brought up or explicitly addressed again, these goats. I wasn’t frightened of them, but I was a little unnerved. Then, a couple of hours later, I was in the thick of the most absurd, over-the-top boss fight I think I’ve ever played in a Resident Evil game.Resident Evil has always had these kinds of fluctuations between slow horror creep and bombastic action. The first few games definitely had their share of ridiculous plots, but the exploration-based gameplay kept the focus on horror. When Resident Evil 4 adopted its landmark behind-the-shoulder perspective and rewarded headshots (and subsequent games refined the shooting even further), it raised the question: Can something that empowers the player this much still be a horror game?Polygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences.

Its first unsettling moment happens during a conversation between the game’s protagonist Ethan Winters and his wife, Mia. The Winters family has moved to Europe at the behest of series mainstay Chris Redfield, who showed up to rescue the pair at the end of Resident Evil 7; the couple has since had a child named Rose, and they’re trying to live a normal domestic life. After a chat about imported wines and local recipes, Ethan tries to bring up the torture they endured during RE7, but Mia shuts him down with a concerning terseness. Then, as if on cue, Chris and a team of soldiers inexplicably assault the Winters’ home and shoot Mia dead, kidnap Rose, and kick off a series of events that lead Ethan to a seemingly abandoned village in the middle of Europe to rescue his daughter. It’s a surprising turn, but it’s also Village establishing expectations for what it’s about to do over the next several hours.Village’s whiplash between horror and action is fierce at first. From the moment I start marching through an oppressively dark neck of European woods, the game is meticulous about how it paces every area, enemy encounter, and set-piece. Even early on, it will startle me with a foreboding look at an enemy in the distance — but won’t let them loose. When my guard is down, it blindsides me. It pits me against overwhelming odds, then, moments before I nearly die, saves me with a bell. Except ... wait. Hasn’t something like this happened before? Village often uses my knowledge of the series to surprise me and subvert my expectations. Capcom is hellbent on using any trick to throw me off-balance, but restrained enough to make its shocking moments count.Building on Resident Evil 7’s move to a first-person perspective and more isolated characters, Village is stingy with ammo and healing items at first, but it does ultimately center around shooting. Over time, I find more guns and ammo and fight a wider variety of enemies more frequently; by the end, I’m not really sweating how many bullets I have left. A shop run by a new character called the Duke lets me upgrade my guns, sell trinkets, and buy ammo (something that not even Resident Evil 4, the series’ first real venture into the shooter genre, allowed). It’s an enticing system that’s unfortunately anchored to the game’s worst character. The Duke is a boring, eye-rolling caricature of a fat person meant to cut through the tension of exploring all of these dreary locales. Most rooms he sets up shop in are decorated or fitted to highlight how fat he is; his stomach pops out of his clothes, revealing a bulging, desaturated pouch. He’s constantly spouting lines like, “To be hungry ... is to be alive.” As if that weren’t enough, health and defense upgrades come from finding and killing farm animals to turn into meals for him, with his leftovers acting as my power-ups. As someone who’s struggled with their weight for most of their life, I found the Duke’s portrayal a frustrating reminder that yes, people still see the overweight as grotesque and slovenly.Despite my issues with the Duke, his wares and weapon upgrades forced me to put up with him. Each gun feels hefty, and while blowing a shotgun pellet through an enemy’s head feels good, the aiming isn’t so precise that it seems mechanical or easy. I had to actively learn to aim these guns, whether that meant lining up multiple enemies so I could pierce them all with a sniper rifle, or wrangling the aim assist so I could pull off consecutive headshots with a handgun. Even after beating the game, I enjoyed a few rounds of the postgame Mercenaries mode just so I could spend more time blasting Lycans with the game’s guns. Village also has a metagame unlock system that offers plenty of reasons to replay the game multiple times at higher difficulties, which I plan on doing.In spite of all the firepower I amass, the ramp from survival horror to all-out shooter isn’t as predictable as it usually is. Village is a much larger game than Resident Evil 7, physically speaking, although it takes about the same amount of time to play, coming in at a brisk 10 or so hours. It covers way more ground than the Baker family’s territory and uses that extra room to give each area its own flavor and tone, and it even sneaks in some cool detours to discover. Every time I set foot outside the village, I can feel myself entering someone else’s domain. Some areas stay more linear in favor of elaborate set-pieces, while others are entirely puzzle-oriented.The first of these, Castle Dimitrescu, has me lurking its halls looking for a way out, eventually being stalked by a formidably tall vampiress named Lady Dimitrescu as I work to unravel her plans and escape. I hate to say it, but despite how much the internet loves her, she’s one of Village’s big disappointments: While she trudges around her castle the way Mr. X haunted the Resident Evil 2 remake’s police station, she’s much too slow and predictable to cause any real tension. Seeing her peek her head through a critical doorway is less terrifying and more eye-rolling as I sprint back to the nearest save room, or run in serpentine paths until she’s bored of me.Her castle does provide the first real taste of that other Resident Evil trademark: a labyrinthe area full of locked doors and hidden keys to pry them all open. Unfurling the giant puzzle box and turning your in-game map from red (denoting that you haven’t found every item in a given room) to blue (after I’ve scooped everything up) is a slow but immensely fulfilling burn. The actual puzzles to get those keys and clear those rooms are pretty simple, but throughout it all, Village drip-feeds just enough items and clues to nudge me forward, throwing in some fun curveballs as I’m heading toward a lock with a key in tow. Each of these sections lets Village turn the dial from horror to action on a dime, and each turn of that dial produces at least one incredible moment, whether it’s a major boss fight, a not-so-subtle reference to another Resident Evil game, or a small, creepy detail like those goats.By the end of the game, I have way more guns and ammo than I know what to do with, and the scale of activities gets as outlandish as the series ever does. But Village is so meticulous about how it paces every area, enemy encounter, and set-piece that it doesn’t matter as much. It regularly offsets my increased firepower with enemies I don’t even want to look at, let alone fight. At one point, the game pits me against a pair of absurdly built enemies in an aggravatingly tight space, and the fact that I have more than enough explosives to deal with them doesn’t do much to calm me down. There’s a potent, albeit different, kind of horror in giving the player all the empowerment they can handle and still finding ways to rattle them.Eventually, the swings between horror and action became so common that, moment to moment, I had no idea what I’d see next. That’s the cycle that Resident Evil Village keeps chasing: the hesitation, anticipation, and payoff that make both action and horror such powerful draws. It’s definitely an action game, and despite all the shooting, it’s also a horror game. And while it induces both creeping dread and righteous fury, its biggest triumph is in not-so-quietly arguing that horror and action aren’t that different after all. They’re both just ways to get your blood pumping. Resident Evil Village will be released May 7 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.

Resident Evil Village,Phil Hornshaw,GameSpot,https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-village-review-shapeshifter/1900-6417672/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f,"The sequel to Resident Evil 7 leans heavily on Resident Evil 4's brand of action, but adds its own sensibilities to the mix.By 
    Phil Hornshaw
   on May 5, 2021 at 8:00AM PDTOver its 25-year history, the Resident Evil series has continually changed and evolved, like a mad scientist who injects himself with a questionable bio-weapon, mutating into something new every time he shows up. For the most part, those evolutions have been fascinating recombinations of elements as Resident Evil tries different mixes of survival-horror and action gameplay. With Resident Evil 7, Capcom swung for the fences with a first-person perspective, a narrower scope, and more horror-focused gameplay. Resident Evil Village evolves that idea to make something that feels very different from its predecessor, but which is just as engaging.Though the perspective and mechanical underpinnings are the same, Village branches off in its own direction from RE7, capturing some of the things that were great about that game while resisting the impulse to retread the same ground. While it's still frightening at points, it takes a less horror-driven tack on the same underlying first-person formula. Village continues to evolve Resident Evil while maintaining a keen grasp on some of its core tenets, finding new ways (or reviving old ones) of getting under your skin and ratcheting up the tension.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Resident Evil Village Video ReviewAs has been pretty clear for a while now, Resident Evil Village is Resident Evil 7 through the lens of Resident Evil 4. When the latter was released way back in 2005, it significantly revamped what the franchise had been up to that point, swapping the earlier games' slower, survival-horror focus for a more fast-paced action approach. RE4 was scary because you were being overwhelmed by enemies, backed into corners, and chased by madmen wielding chainsaws. It traded darkened corridors and jump scares for adrenaline-fueled panic.So while RE7 leans into the dark and creepy haunted house idea of the very first Resident Evil, Village transforms that take by taking cues from the faster, panickier RE4. It's again played from a tight, closed-in first-person perspective that has you constantly wondering what's behind you, and it still often focuses on slower movement and exploration through its gorgeous, twisting environments. But Village's approach is distinctly more action-centric, and it's remarkable how much Capcom has managed to push the formula of its reboot to the series in such a different direction.Village picks up on Resident Evil 7's story three years later, again focusing on protagonist Ethan Winters. After rescuing his wife Mia from the Baker house and subsequently getting saved by Resident Evil franchise mainstay Chris Redfield, Ethan and Mia went into hiding with Chris' help, moving to Europe to restart their lives. They've since had a daughter, and while they're trying to put their lives back together, Ethan continues to struggle with the trauma he experienced. Mia, meanwhile, keeps trying to put the subject out of her mind and even seems to be struggling to remember it. But before Ethan can really get to the bottom of why his wife is acting kinda weird about the whole ""survived being tormented in a house full of monsters"" trauma they shared, Chris and his team bust into the couple's house and drag Ethan and baby Rose off.Ethan wakes up some time later after a car crash. The two random special forces guys who were transporting him and Rose are dead. Ethan wanders through the snowy woods in search of his missing child, until he hits a ramshackle, seemingly empty village. Before long, he discovers it's under siege by what appear to be werewolves. It's all extremely reminiscent of the beginning of Resident Evil 4, which upended the RE formula by dropping you into a village overrun with enemies who acted like humans rather than shambling, mindless zombies. The lycans wield weapons and shoot arrows at you, and to avoid getting surrounded, you can run into houses and barricade the doors with furniture to slow their advances. The first major challenge in Village is to survive an onslaught of these creatures as you frantically try to create barricades, find weapons, and make a run for it before you're completely overwhelmed. Just like its 2005 inspiration, the opening battle of Village taps into a frightening intensity of trying to create a defensible position or take part in a running gunfight that you're in serious danger of losing. It's a completely different feeling from the slow-burn dread of RE7, whose combat builds fear from the realization that the number of bullets in your gun is not the same as the number of bullets you need to kill one of its lumbering Molded enemies. But Village's combat can make your heart pound just as hard.Really, the fact that Village feels like such a turn away from RE7 is what works about it--as a sequel, it feels like Capcom reaching for a new way to challenge itself. Most of the time in Village, at least on its standard difficulty, you'll find yourself well-outfitted for whatever you're about to face--the challenge is in using those resources effectively and keeping yourself alive. Village uses the same movement systems as RE7, which can feel a little slow and clunky at times; Ethan isn't especially agile and even at a sprint, it can feel like he's barely moving. Despite a sense of trudging through molasses, Village is tuned so that enemies also approach slowly and cautiously, so dealing with them comes together like a standoff that has you judging their moves or hitting their weak points before they have a chance to get in close and rip into you. It also adds to the tension as you try to navigate through areas to keep yourself out of danger--the first-person view means your awareness is very narrow, so staying hypervigilant about your surroundings is essential. Sometimes, you just have to run and hope you can find a better place to make your stand.While the controls work for tense moments when surrounded, they feel a little wobblier in boss battles. Here, you're often dodging attacks as a monster charges you or swings at you with a huge weapon. You can absorb some damage with the ability to hold up your hands in a guard, another holdover from RE7 that helps mitigate the limitations of your movement, but the better strategy is to try to run around a battlefield and get out of the way. That usually means sacrificing seeing what your opponent is doing so you can make a quick dash one way or the other, and it's a bit of a weird way to fight. Since Ethan can't step sideways while looking forward, you're constantly just sort of running for it and hoping whatever is coming at you doesn't hit you. It doesn't make these boss battles frustrating or add to their difficulty, but it does add a counterintuitiveness to combat that can take you out of the moment.Bullets are easy to come by, and if you're short, you can craft more from materials you find by searching your surroundings, or purchase them from the Duke, a traveling merchant with a penchant for showing up just when you need him. You'll find lots of guns and gun upgrades throughout the game, and you'll revisit the central town repeatedly to scour it for new hidden items. There's even a system for upgrading your character that involves animals like pigs and chickens scattered around the village. Shoot them and bring their meat to the Duke, he'll cook them into meals that increase your health, amp up your movement speed, or make your guard more effective. All that stuff you're carrying around has to go somewhere, so Village brings back the inventory management system of RE4: You have a suitcase full of weapons, ammo, and health items, with each item taking up spaces on a grid. For most of the game, you probably won't have to worry about this, but as things wear on, you'll start to find yourself hauling more and more gear. You can move items around to make sure they all fit in your case, Tetris-style, and purchase bigger cases from the Duke so you can bring more stuff--but this system is most interesting when it starts making you wonder if you should sell off old guns or toss less useful items in favor of things like extra ammo. Mercifully, crafting materials aren't counted in your inventory, so you're free to make bullets and health items on the fly. But planning what you do and don't need to pick up becomes a consideration in exploration, albeit never a major one.Though Village has far more variety of enemies to fight than RE7, it's not all shooting, with a lot of varied pacing and new challenges throughout. There are four different areas to unlock as you progress through the story, each headed by one of the Four Lords--the scary monster people who dominate the village and the area around it. The first is the castle run by Lady Dimitrescu (she of much internet fame), and while you'll spend lots of time popping the skulls of lycans in the village, there's a lot less shooting to be done in the castle portion. You'll occasionally face enemies you have to gun down, but much more time in the castle is spent navigating its tight corridors as Dimitrescu and her daughters--all seemingly vampires capable of turning themselves into clouds of bugs and recomposing themselves elsewhere--are hunting you. You can't kill Dimistrescu or her daughters with your conventional weapons, so you have to run if you're found. The entire level is spent exploring the castle, looking for the items you need to advance through the area, while listening for Dimistrescu's clomping footsteps and trying to keep away from her.Even in this very first new area, Village is mixing and remixing its experience with the different horror ideas. You're not just shotgunning tons of enemies, you're also engaging in stealth that's much more akin to what navigating the Baker house was like in RE7. Later portions of the game throw different obstacles into your path. There are puzzle-heavy levels reminiscent of the mansion of Resident Evil or the police station of Resident Evil 2. There are sections where you hear frightfully powerful enemies in the distance, and knowing you're going to have to face them down, begin heaping ammo into your pockets in preparation. And there are points that show Village can also hone in on some of the intense frights that made RE7 so remarkable--points that are too damn good to spoil here.Suffice to say that though Village gives you lots of guns and lets you use them, it also is great at maintaining an atmosphere of unease as you head around each new corner. You might have plenty of weapons, but can you handle what you're about to face? Will they even work against the next creature you encounter? There's an excellent balance between providing lots of action and maintaining that dread. This isn't the same kind of intense anxiety that RE7 conjured up, but Village encourages its own kind of fear, and it hits you with a few great RE7-like setpieces to ratchet up the tension when you least expect it. One particular ""oh crap"" moment with Dimitrescu comes to mind; others later in the game remind you that just because you have a lot of guns doesn't mean you're invincible. No two sections of Village are quite the same, and each draws on different aspects of past Resident Evil games to combine them with the underlying RE7 feel to create something that's both new and nostalgic. It's impressive how deftly the game can change into something a little different again and again throughout its runtime, and each section is fun, intense, and, naturally, frightening in its own way. The result is a game that clips right along, constantly throwing something new at you but always feeling like an interesting new take on what you already know and have experienced. It's a hodgepodge of Resident Evil ideas, yes, but each one is executed exceedingly well--this is a game that seems aware of the franchise's entire history and is able to summon its best elements at will.The caveat to that is the last hour of the game, where things take a weird, over-the-top turn. In the run-up to Village's final moments, the action gets turned up even higher, resulting in a final few enemy encounters that wind up feeling like needless digressions and don't add much to the overall package. Where past fights with hordes of lycans were intense affairs that required you to keep moving and pay careful attention to what you were facing, these last bits feel a bit like you've stepped through a portal into another game. For a few moments there, Village draws up the worst action-heavy portions of Resident Evil 6, losing track of what made you grit your teeth and clench your fists and exchanging it for something more akin to shooters like Call of Duty.This same moment highlights some of the inconsistency in Village's story. Despite pre-release imagery focused on the Umbrella corporation's logo appearing in the game, the way that Village connects with the larger RE franchise feels a bit tacked on. The same is true of Chris Redfield, who shows up here and there to say something cryptic without really revealing anything. The focus on Ethan's interactions with the Four Lords and uncovering what's going on in the village is more fun and interesting--these are antagonists who come off as petty and human. They don't particularly like each other but are all eager to torture and maim you anyway, and their interactions with Ethan and each other add dimension to their characters. In all, this isn't the best Resident Evil story, but it is a spooky romp with fun villains. It's just a shame that more time wasn't devoted to pulling on all the hanging story threads of RE7, or in tying it together with the franchise at large.Thankfully, the late-game digression doesn't last long, and the elements about the combat that are fun--the one-on-one or one-on-too-many sparring nature of fights, and finding ways to take down tough enemies before they can rip you apart--are transplanted into the fast-paced arcade mode The Mercenaries. This also feels like a lift straight out of Resident Evil 4; it takes the combat of Village, slaps a timer on it, and focuses it on scoring points. The Mercenaries is a fun side activity in its own right, always daring you to get a higher score by balancing taking down enemies quickly and trying to complete one of its given levels as fast as you can. It demonstrates how tight the combat in Village can be, although at times it can be held back a bit by the slow, underwater-feeling of movement around the battlefield. Another aspect of the Village package is Resident Evil Re:Verse, a multiplayer-focused mode in which you fight other players as both Resident Evil characters and monsters. Re:Verse is slated to release separately sometime this summer for Village buyers, but it wasn't included with our review copy.Resident Evil 7 was an excellent return to the horror underpinnings of the franchise, but cunningly altered with new ideas and a new perspective. Similarly, Village is an intelligent reintroduction of the best action elements of Resident Evil. Though it captures some of the same things that made RE7 such a breath of fresh air (or maybe rancid, stale, mold-filled air, but in a good way), Village evolves to become its own unique creature. It makes you wonder what beautifully twisted fiend Resident Evil might mutate into in the future.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"
Resident Evil Village,Ian Walker,Kotaku,https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-village-the-kotaku-review-1846823333,"I remember vividly the first time I played one of my favorite games of all time, Resident Evil 4.While not what I would call a huge fan of the survival horror series before then, I voraciously devoured every bit of Resident Evil 4 info I could get my hands on leading up to its January 2005 release. My dad, who heard no end of my excited explanations of the story and mechanics, surprised me one day with a rental copy from our local Hollywood Video. I settled in that night to finally experience the horror myself, and after running into my first Dr. Salvador, called my friend over to play it with me. It was a huge moment, one that reignited my love for video games and, in hindsight, more than likely helped me find the path to my current career.I take this self-indulgent trip down memory lane because Resident Evil Village—releasing this Friday for everything but Switch—feels like Capcom’s attempt at remaking Resident Evil 4 without actually remaking Resident Evil 4. Despite a lack of real scares and an over-reliance on action over horror in its third act, Resident Evil Village is everything I wanted out of a new Resident Evil game. Combat is hefty and brutal, the monsters are unforgiving and relentless, and the set pieces are compelling enough to make up for some inconsistent pacing and difficulty. Moment to moment, Resident Evil Village consistently surprised me with its dips and turns, the way that first trip through Resident Evil 4 did.The franchise’s eighth main installment in everything but name, Resident Evil Village directly follows the story of 2017’s Resident Evil 7. Ethan Winters, the everyman protagonist introduced in the previous game alongside its new, first-person perspective, has settled down somewhere in Europe with his wife Mia and baby daughter Rosemary, three years after surviving the swamps of Louisiana. Village opens with an intimate view of their new life together, but there’s a cryptic undercurrent of discord that cuts through their domestic bliss. The torture they endured at the hands of the mold-infected Baker family still looms large in their lives, a lingering trauma they can’t seem to shake.Things take a turn before you’re given a chance to explore this dynamic. Someone riddles their home with bullets, and series mainstay Chris Redfield is revealed to be the orchestrator of the chaos. But this is a much different Chris than the one who contended with zombies in the original Resident Evil, punched boulders in Resident Evil 5, and most recently rescued the Winterses in Resident Evil 7. Grizzled and imposing, Chris shoots Mia and kidnaps Rosemary, leaving Ethan begging for answers.While Chris played a small, surprising role in the previous game, his introduction as a foil to Ethan in the opening of Resident Evil Village acts as a microcosm for the franchise. The series began its life taking down shambling zombies in 1996, but the threats soon became much more over-the-top. As such, so did its playable characters. Chris, who was barely more than SWAT in a small Midwestern town when he first entered the Spencer Mansion all those years ago, has since evolved into a near-superhuman figure in the Resident Evil universe. A normal dude like Ethan was inevitable and necessary when Resident Evil 7 ultimately returned the series to its less action-oriented, survival horror roots.Resident Evil Village forces you to wrestle with that history by placing one of these mythical ur-protagonists as opposition long before any monsters make the scene. Ethan has been through his fair share of danger, but it’s nothing compared to Chris’ now decades-long history of saving mankind from potentially world-ending threats. How do you overcome a man whose legacy has routinely escalated to the point of being supernatural? It’s a clever way of raising the stakes without immediately relying on a new, more fantastical bioweapon, and serves as a promising jumping off point for this new game.It’s here that discussing the plot of Resident Evil Village gets complicated. In giving Kotaku a copy of the game ahead of release, Capcom has placed multiple restrictions on what we can say about the game’s boss battles, cutscenes, and overall story. While I understand the need to preserve the surprise for players, it also means I can’t yet discuss some of Resident Evil Village’s most creative and effective moments. The basics—that Ethan ends up in the titular village in pursuit of his daughter’s captors—have been a central part of the game’s marketing, but there’s lots to talk around when it comes to other details.Ethan, confused and alone, is left to his own devices once he arrives in the village, allowing the player to get their bearings and explore a few of the abandoned shacks that make up the small community. The dated, dusty settlement feels like an obvious call back to the rural Spanish countryside of Resident Evil 4. It’s full of nooks and crannies, with several environmental clues that detail what life was like before tragedy arrived. Chickens and pigs wander aimlessly in untended pens, waiting to be butchered and used as ingredients in health- and defense-improving meals later on. Some areas remain hidden behind intricate locks, serving as brain-tickling reminders to come back and snoop around the hub area once the requisite keys have been found elsewhere.When Resident Evil Village gets back to shooting bad guys, it proves itself to be just as competent as its predecessor. If you’re at all familiar with Resident Evil 7, you’ll be able to jump into Village with very little learning curve, but with a few minor changes. The ability to press the left bumper to defend yourself from melee attacks still exists, and this time around, pressing it a second time pushes the enemy away, opening them up to a quick headshot or shotgun blast. Furniture can be moved in front of doorways to avoid being overrun and packs of flour can be shot to obscure your movement. In fact, running away is sometimes the best option just to save ammo and healing items—even the game’s grunts, ferocious beast men known as lycans, can prove deadly if you’re not ready for their animalistic feints and charges. Enemies drop items upon death, a feature from previous games that was absent in Resident Evil 7, and its return makes combat even more of a balancing act, asking you to weigh using ammo and losing health against the potential for making more money or finding vital crafting materials.""Ethan Winters' European Vacation""First-person survival horrorSimilarities to Resident Evil 4, Donna Beneviento, weighty gunplay.The inevitable action-heavy conclusion, mostly uninspired bosses.CapcomPlayStation 4, PlayStation 5 (played), Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Steam, StadiaMay 7, 202111 hours on Standard difficulty, with lots of exploration, back-tracking, gun upgrades, and ingredient-gathering along the way.Every gun, from the basic handgun given to Ethan at the start of the game to more powerful fare like the grenade launcher, feels great to shoot, especially with the haptics and pressure-sensitive triggers of the PlayStation 5’s DualSense controller. There’s even a neat little thing where the right trigger becomes incredibly loose between uses of weapons with low fire rates, like shotguns and sniper rifles, with tension only returning when they are ready to be fired again. This provides some really fun moments during more hectic encounters: I lost track of the number of times I cursed at my controller because it wasn’t allowing me to shoot an approaching monster, replicating what it must feel like to have an actual gun jam up in real-life combat situations.Another aspect of Resident Evil 4 echoed in Resident Evil Village is the ability to upgrade your weapons, both with attachments found in the wild and upgrades bought from the game’s new merchant, an enigmatic figure known only as The Duke. Money is just as precious as healing items, providing a separate, economic puzzling of whether to cash out on bolstering your ammo reserves or saving up to make your pistol a little bit stronger or quicker on the reload. I also very much enjoyed the return of the inventory management system, a pseudo mini-game where guns, ammo, and other items have to be organized in your attaché case, even if it doesn’t have all that much bearing on the overall game.This all boils down to the chief conflict in the Resident Evil franchise (apart from, y’know, the monsters and stuff): making the most of a bad situation. So much of the ebb and flow of Resident Evil Village is the never-ending series of micro-choices that may have repercussions down the line. Ethan is constantly beset by danger, and it’s often up to you to decide which of the options presented to you is the least terrible. While it was rare for me to come up short on crafting materials to make ammo or healing items—thanks to an obsessive need to search everywhere before moving on with the story—there were late-game moments when I found myself anxiously relegated to using my sniper rifle in close combat. It was a kind of “whatever works” strategy that feels right at home in the crumbling, desperate world of Resident Evil and imparted me with some of Ethan’s own stress.While the game’s care to reference the enemy sieges and gunplay of Resident Evil 4 makes it a consistently tense experience, Resident Evil Village just plain isn’t scary most of the time, perhaps intentionally. Making progress early on is often a matter of entering dark, creaky buildings while monsters scuffle and growl just out of sight, but my arsenal of weaponry soon became so powerful that, on standard difficulty, serious threats were few and far between. Village’s boss battles felt similarly underwhelming, mostly acting as chapter-ending bullet sponges with very little in the way of scares or strategy. The only part of the game that really provided a fright was my visit to Donna Beneviento’s mansion—unfortunately, as I mentioned before, I’m not allowed to talk about that here. In fact, the last few action-heavy hours of the game are about as far away as you can get from the beginning’s attempts at survival horror. This escalation is a problem that even the modern era’s best Resident Evil games haven’t managed to solve, and it continues to be a disappointment whenever a new installment rolls around. The series never quite manages to stick the landing, its compelling openings writing checks that the conclusions ultimately can’t cash.Just a few years ago, Resident Evil 7 marked a return to the series’ survival horror roots, setting a high bar for its eventual follow-up. While Resident Evil Village still falls prey to the series’ most pernicious problems, notably the inevitable swerve from horror to action and bosses that don’t quite match the strong moment-to-moment gameplay, those shortcomings don’t overshadow the frequency with which the game hits on all cylinders. Village may not  live up to the potential of its immediate predecessor, but it’s a safe new entry in the series that induces the same entertaining anxiety as my favorite Resident Evil games and provides a few interesting wrinkles for where the franchise might go next.

Resident Evil Village reviewed on PS5. Also available on PC, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Stadia.Resident Evil Village is a direct sequel to Resident Evil 7, and as such, it has big shoes to fill. After the bestselling but poorly received Resident Evil 6 (and some terrible spin-offs), Resident Evil found itself in a rut. Fortunately, Resident Evil 7 tapped into the franchise’s roots and combined classic survival horror with modern gameplay to revitalize the series.Since the debut of RE7, Capcom has given us a bit of a mixed bag. Resident Evil 2 remake was one of the best games ever made, while Resident Evil 3 remake and the multiplayer Resident Evil: Resistance were met with a lukewarm reception. Where RE7 tapped into the original Resident Evil to revitalize the series, RE Village is channeling RE4. As such, it’s a faster-paced, more combat-oriented game with a much more expansive setting. The big question is whether or not that’s the best direction for the series. Resident Evil Village continues the story of Ethan and Mia Winters. Several years after the events in Dulvey Parish, Louisiana, the two have established new identities and a new life in Europe. They’ve even settled down enough to have a baby, Rose. Everything is looking up until Chris Redfield leads a raid on their home, shooting Mia and kidnapping Ethan and Rose.When Ethan awakens, he’s on the outskirts of a mysterious village, which he discovers is under siege by what seem to be werewolves. As he tries to find his daughter and figure out why Chris did what he did, Ethan becomes entangled in the machinations of the village’s leader and religious icon, Mother Miranda, and her “children,” the four heads of the local great houses: Lady Alcina Dimetrescu, Karl Heisenberg, Salvatore Moreau, and Donna Beneviento.With as much attention as Lady Dimetrescu received, she’s woefully underutilized, as are the rest of the antagonists other than the most boring one, Mother Miranda. The problem is that each of the four house leaders is relegated to its own territory, so each only gets a small bit of screen time.Instead of being a unified front, Ethan very methodically deals with each of the antagonists one at a time. Because of this, none of them are really given the room to develop as characters, which leaves them feeling very one-dimensional. Dimetrescu is big and angry; Heisenberg is a rebel and angry; Moreau is ugly, dumb, and angry; and Donna is asocial and angry. I never expected a total biographical flashback for each of them, but I did want to know their motivations beyond Mother Miranda’s wishes.RE Village’s plot is a lot more tenuous than its predecessor as well. By the time RE7 was over, you knew why the Bakers and Mia went insane, what happened in the three years Mia was gone, Eveline’s history, and who was behind it all. Despite the mold creatures being a bit lame, it was all explained in a way that at least tried to be scientific. I’m still not sure why some of the enemies in RE Village are Lycans, why some are just creepy hairless zombie-type things, or why Lady Dimitrescu is a vampire. There’s a very feeble attempt to explain it, but it’s thin.Threads pop in and out constantly. First, there’s a creepy cult around Mother Miranda, with a whole village of technology adverse people worshipping her. However, despite being a focal point of marketing, this concept is quickly pushed aside. Things are only explained as to how they fit in the moment, and as soon as they’re offscreen, they’re usually forgotten. The exception to this is Mother Miranda, who I found to be boring compared to her “children.” Her motivation is trite, and she’s one of the weakest antagonists of the series.The biggest problem is that the game tries to do too much in a short amount of time, so nothing has a chance to have much depth. I finished my first playthrough on Standard difficulty in a little under nine and a half hours, and I thoroughly explored each area, including the optional ones, read every file (except one), and scoured the map for items. Along the way, I constantly felt rushed. Sure there’s an impetus for Ethan to keep it moving since his daughter has been kidnapped, but the pacing never allows you to get too invested in any one aspect of the game.That’s not to say I didn’t enjoy the game. In fact, it’s the opposite. It could have used a few extra hours of game time to expand the story a bit and tie it back to the rest of the series more. As it is, outside of Chris Redfield’s presence and a few references, RE7 and RE Village feel more like their own separate series than part of a larger franchise.The game returns to the first-person perspective introduced in Resident Evil 7. Although I love the Resident Evil 2 remake, I think first-person is the way to go for the series from now on. Horror works best when it feels like it’s happening to you instead of an on-screen avatar, and getting behind the eyes of the protagonist enhances that for me.The combat is very similar to RE7, although the gunplay has been tightened up a bit (with the explanation that Ethan got some BSAA training after he and Mia were rescued). However, for whatever reason, he still can’t figure out gun sights. He’s got a normal hipfire, which is relatively accurate. However, unlike most games, when you press the “aim” button, Ethan just raises his firearm to shoulder level instead of looking down the sights. This makes no sense, especially considering one of the weapon upgrades you can find is a red-dot sight.There’s a wider variety of weapons this time around, including different variations of the handgun and shotgun. This brings in a bit of strategy as later models of these weapons start off more powerful, but cost more to upgrade. There’s not quite enough cash to fully upgrade each gun, so players have to be smart about where they’re spending their Lei.The inventory has been changed from item slots to the case system used in Resident Evil 4. However, unlike in RE4, the case never feels too crowded. I was able to carry four weapons, explosives, meat, and ammo, and only occasionally needed to rearrange my items. The case felt more like an homage than anything, which is fine. However, I would have liked to have seen more emphasis on inventory management, as having separate repositories for crafting items, key items, treasure, and then the case made it much too easy to keep a considerable stockpile.Also channeling RE4 is The Duke. This big boy appears to help point Ethan in the right direction and sell him arms and items to help him on his quest. The Duke also offers gunsmith services to upgrade weapons and, later on, will even cook for Ethan if you bring him ingredients (while taking his own portion, of course). I like the system and the character, but again, having a large man appearing in impossible locations throughout the game detracts from the immersion of the whole thing. The merchant in RE4 was fairly low key, but The Duke is larger than life (literally) and is an exemplar of the game’s strange tone.Resident Evil Village is a gorgeous game. Capcom has gone above and beyond with the environmental design, crafting a detailed and diverse world full of detail. I really can’t overstate just how good of a job the devs did here.The village itself is full of creaky old buildings that feel extremely lived-in. You can really picture generations of families being born, living, and dying in this ancient hamlet. Each home has a unique design that highlights the fact that they were all individually designed and constructed.In stark contrast to the humble village homes is Castle Dimitrescu. Its imposing cold stone hides an ostentatious interior reminiscent of Versailles. Much like its Lady, Castle Dimitrescu’s ornate halls hide sinister secrets, and the dank dungeons below are filled with failed experiments.Heisenberg’s factory and Moreau’s reservoir also serve to complement their masters. The factory, especially, serves as an excellent contrast to the rest of the game’s bygone locales. However, as much as I loved each individual location, the difference between them seemed too jarring at times. With each antagonist getting their own territory, the game can feel very much like a theme park.It’s a bit nonsensical walking through a humble village, which could, at the most, house a few hundred people, then visiting the factory, where Heisenberg is cranking out cybernetic monstrosities by the truckload. Style takes precedence over sense, which is acceptable for some works of horror, but not for one that bases its origins in “science.”Since the game has a fairly short playtime, none of the locales gets much of a chance to take center stage. Giving more backstory on each area and more opportunities for exploration would have gone a long way toward easing the theme park feeling. As it is, I felt rushed through each place and whisked away before I learned anything solid about their history.Thankfully, Resident Evil Village has a lot more staying power than Resident Evil 3 remake. Capcom’s last title was panned for its low replayability (for good reason). Village has the now-standard Extra Content Shop, which allows players to buy things like infinite ammo, concept art, models, and new weapons for story mode with points earned through in-game challenges.There are also multiple difficulty levels, but Hardcore and Village of Shadows (Very Hard) only raised enemy health, speed, and attack power and lowered the amount of ammo you get with each pickup. I would have liked to have seen something akin to RE7’s Madhouse mode with different item placement, as making Ethan softer and foes spongier isn’t that interesting.However, the return of The Mercenaries in Resident Evil Village is the big post-game draw here. In this game mode, players play through a series of levels and earn points by defeating enemies, gathering Lei, all set to a timer. The key to getting a big score is to combo enemies, collect the most cash possible, and hit the end goal with plenty of time remaining. After completing all the stages in an area, the player’s score is tallied, and they’re given a ranking from C to SSS.I’ve had a blast with The Mercenaries so far. Since you can buy weapons and items before and between each level, there’s a lot of experimentation required to find the best setup for each situation. Enemies spawn in the same place each time, so with each run, you get a little better at memorizing their placement and figuring out what combo of weapons works best.I struggled to get the A ranking needed to unlock consecutive stages, and I still haven’t figured out how to hit an S, SS, or SSS. I’m going to continue optimizing my route, and I’m excited to see how players perfect their runs. I hope that Capcom supports this mode with post-launch DLC, because it’s infinitely more interesting than RE:Verse.I went into Resident Evil Village with an open mind and came away with a decent game. There’s a lot of individual parts of it that I really, really like. The environmental design is fantastic, and I love each of the minor antagonists. The problem is that these things don’t quite mesh together. It’s still a spectacle, and I still thoroughly enjoyed my time with the game, but I don’t believe fans will remember it with the same fondness as RE7 and RE2 remake.I’ve been a fan of Resident Evil since I played the original RE2 when it was released in 1998. However, I’m not a purist. The increased emphasis on action isn’t Resident Evil Village’s issue. The problem is that it’s taken many elements and smooshed them together with little regard as to how they fit. If Capcom took a little more care with the game’s tone and its place in the series, it could have been a classic. As it is, RE Village is simply a good game with excellent production value.GameRevolution reviewed Resident Evil Village on PS5.

Resident Evil Village,Chris Carter,Destructoid,https://www.destructoid.com/stories/review-resident-evil-village-627405.phtml,"darkHow did we get here?It feels like just yesterday that I rode to the store (RIP Power Video) to rent the original Resident Evil, which transported me to a magical haunted mansion for an entire weekend. From there Capcom slowly ramped up the action and ham to the utter point of excess in RE6. People couldn’t take it anymore! I think some of you drew the line at Wesker’s anime son punching zombies.Sure enough, Capcom got back to their roots with the spooky Resident Evil 7, and it paid off, big time, as it’s the most successful entry to date, and their overall second-best-selling game ever. Village brings back some of that lovely Christmas glazed ham and pairs it with the first-person horror of RE7. But mostly in a good way.Resident Evil Village (PC, PS4, PS5 [reviewed], Stadia, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S)
Developer: Capcom
Publisher: Capcom
Released: May 7, 2021
MSRP: $59.99Like RE7, Village pulls a few unconventional storytelling tricks to let you know that it’s not your typical Resident Evil.The storybook intro (which has tonal throughputs that reverberate throughout the narrative) is lovely. The following scene is…without spoiling anything (it will be spoiled somewhere, as this was one of the few twists we could talk about in the review), is a little crazy and intense. Suffice to say, Ethan gets royally screwed yet again, but this time the stakes are a little higher, and the mystery is a little more enticing.That’s not to say it’s a “grand scale” per se. The “village” is actually a medium-sized region, complete with a towering castle and some adjacent waterways and a few other locations. It’s not a silly globe-hopping adventure like some entries, and it’s honestly not even as expansive as RE4, from an “amount of ground covered” standpoint. It’s a touch above intimate, which is a great middle ground for newer and older fans.It’s also a great marriage of camp and horror. There are shades of Resident Evil 7 lurking beneath the surface, as the mystery is fresh and new, but there are also giant vampire countesses; amid some extremely fan-servicey breadcrumbs that the previous entry didn’t quite dare to tread on. There’s at least two “what the hell” moments that will get people talking in some fashion (where are my RE lore nuts?).[brid video=”777347″ player=”12899″ title=”Resident%20Evil%20Village%20Review” duration=”302″ description=”Destructoid’s review of Resident Evil Village.We’re taking a trip out to the village of Resident Evil Village! AKA Resident Evil 8! Or do you prefer Roman numerals? Resident Evil VIII? Who cares! We’ve got tall vampires and first-person perspectives to talk about, so sit back and enjoy the video!” uploaddate=”2021-05-05″ thumbnailurl=”//cdn.brid.tv/live/partners/10260/thumb/777347_t_1620243694.jpg” contentUrl=”//cdn.brid.tv/live/partners/10260/sd/777347.mp4″]It doesn’t completely eschew the heightened horror feel either. It’s primarily an unsettling slower burn, with some jump scares thrown in for good measure. Similar to how I had to rip off the VR helmet with RE7 to catch a breather, I had to take off my PS5 headphones for RE8 a few times. The sound design, particularly the ambient noises like rattling and clanking, is top-notch.Speaking of, it doesn’t impact this review in any way, but I do miss the VR option! Looking up at ‘ol Annie in Vader Immortal was extremely cool, and the same could have been said for squaring up against Dimitrescu, the aforementioned vampire. I’m not just bringing up VR to wax nostalgia over RE7 though: the first-person style still works without it.The tension and sense of claustrophobia are still present, as are the memorable “hallway battles,” and plenty of open-air 360-degree fights. Particularly early on it does feel very guided/scripted, and many of the puzzles are extremely light fare and quite a few are optional. Depending on the area you’re in, it has that “spokes on a wheel” illusion of exploration; and the top item on my Village wishlist is for a few of those zones to be more expansive.A lot of Village could be annoying and gamey, but it isn’t. It’s just enough of a systems alteration to not piss people off. Crafting still feels extremely optional, only there if you want to double down on using a certain gun (with the power to create more ammo) or if you need a boost through a boss battle with a healing item. The shop is also an interesting mix of old and new school RE, providing upgrades like RE4 without going too overboard. You can even buy more inventory blocks to play storage Tetris with!It took me around eight hours to see the end, but like most RE games, it’s worth the replays, as you attempt to comb through all of the collectibles and secrets. There are four difficulty settings, as well as tons of little extras to play around with: the classic new shop with random goodies like infinite ammo toggles, new equipment, figures, and concept art. Then there’s Mercenaries. It’s back again!I’ll say this: although it’s not going to blow the doors off of any old school Mercenaries fan, I’m glad it’s in, at least. It’s a very arcadey diversion in the sense that you’re trying to rack up points, then either go for broke and clear out stages or head for the exit as soon as you hit a very clear “kill goal.” Time, combos (taking out enemies in succession), and a few other factors dictate your score, and you unlock new stages with an A rank or above (with bonuses doled out for other ranks).I wish it offered full multiplayer and was as elaborate as Raid Mode, but in any case, I view it as an extra, and I’m glad we didn’t just have to settle for whatever Re:Verse ends up becoming. Also, completing challenges in Mercenaries mode provides points to unlock stuff in the main mode, which is a nice little two-way street.I don’t think Resident Evil Village is going to be very divisive per se: I suspect the reaction will be generally positive. But it’s going to definitely spark some conversations as to how it stacks up against the current darling of RE7, and it has a long hill to climb to match its success financially. As for me, I think it complements it quite well, and then some.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]SuperbA hallmark of excellence. There may be flaws, but they are negligible and won't cause massive damage.

Signup for a Free AccountAlready have an account? Login NowResident Evil Village walks a line of fear and action that reminds of a certain road we've been down before, but it's one worth traveling nonetheless.For as long as I have been playing the Resident Evil series, Resident Evil Village hit me in a certain way. Many will remember Resident Evil 4 as monumental shift for the franchise. I enjoyed RE4 thoroughly as well, but I couldn’t help looking at it as the pivotal point where the franchise began a noteworthy turn from survival horror into action. Years later, Resident Evil Village struck me oh so familiar to how Leon Kennedy’s own village and castle adventures played out so long ago. In a similar manner, Resident Evil Village’s journey doesn’t always work to the service of horror, but it does take working parts of previous titles and gives them a gorgeous coat of new paint nonetheless.Resident Evil Village finds us back in the role of Ethan Winters, moving the story forward three years after the events of the Baker Incident in RE7. Going off that game’s “good” ending, Ethan and his wife Mia relocated to Europe and had a child, their baby daughter Rosemary. It’s pretty clear they’re still shaken from the events that tortured them so mercilessly years before, but they try to make the best of it. Keyword is try. It isn’t long before their attempt at a regular family life is shattered by a hail of bullets and the abduction of their daughter. One rifle butt to the head, an unplanned nap, and a crashed military van later, Ethan finds himself stranded on the outskirts of a mysterious village without his wife and daughter.As should probably be expected, Resident Evil Village’s titular village is not doing okay. The whole town is dead and broken sans a few questionably lucky survivors. The cause? Some very fuzzy rabid humanoids with a penchant for feasting on unturned human flesh. Along the way, Ethan learns that his daughter is somehow in the village and the key to saving her lays with four supernaturally powerful figures and the even more powerful Lady Miranda who once offered protection to the village. Fans should already be well aware of one – the very popular and tall Lady Dimetrescu.Much like Dimetrescu and her often teased castle, the other “Lords” each preside over a unique domain near the village and Ethan is going to have to pay them all house calls if he means to save Rose. I will give fair warning without spoilers here: If you thought Dimetrescu was going to take up the lion’s share of your time in this game, realize that she’s just one of the Four Lords alongside Lady Miranda and temper your expectations accordingly. Don’t get me wrong, though, her entire presence in the game is a highlight. I’d actually argue every encounter with the Four Lords is pretty great.Resident Evil Village’s environments are quite varied and breathtaking. The village acts as a connecting hub at the heart of it all and each return to it peels back a little bit of the mysteries hidden within, but the four domains you’ll travel to are also equal parts gorgeous and harrowing. Each is filled to the brim with their own unique blend of action, traps, and monsters, as well as puzzles and secrets you’ll want to unravel if you’re going to gain the means you need to survive each oncoming challenge. The puzzles are passable, though nothing too outlandish or tricky - mostly bringing key items from point A to point B with a few decent exceptions.The visuals are really where the game shines. Lady Dimetrescu’s castle is a splendid array of lavish décor hiding a ghastly underbelly, whereas the walk to another Lord’s castle took us through a foggy path to a calm and eerie mountainside home near a stunningly beautiful waterfall. It was hard not to notice a little bit of texture pop-in at certain points in regular gameplay, but the places Village worked to direct my eyes to at any given point were often exhilarating, unnerving, drop-dead gorgeous, or some mix of those three elements.Let’s get right down to the nitty gritty of gameplay, which I think both does well in a certain light and is cause for concern in another. Most of Resident Evil Village controls as if Resident Evil 7’s POV and movement was blended with Resident Evil 4's action and trading mechanics. By that I mean this game throws creatures and intense situations at you like an unrepentant cyclone and it can feel overwhelming at first, but it also puts so many guns and bullets in simple curiosity’s reach that you can easily feel like you’re the scariest thing in the village.I kid you not, by hour three of the game I had a shotgun, a rifle, and a part upgrade for my pistol. By hour six I had already gotten some explosives and had the liberty of deciding what weapons I wanted to keep upgrading or sell. There are certain points in Village where it could easily be scary or unnerving if I wasn’t Ethan “Rambo’s scarier brother” Winters, armed to the teeth and ready to pulp any creature dumb enough to get in my face. After the exhilaration of fending off one particular pack of monsters, I even found myself audibly yelling out, “who wants to die next?” It’s a bit puzzling to me to feel that way in a Resident Evil game, though I can’t deny I enjoy the impact and variation of the weapons, their upgrades, and the gunplay.Similarly, aiding in that feeling is the presence of the Duke who appears throughout the game. This indulgent mystery man is well-acquainted with you, the village, and the mysteries abound for reasons he won’t reveal. More importantly, he hosts an ever-present shop of weapon upgrades, ammo, gun parts, and other provisions. His prices would be off-putting if Resident Evil Village wasn’t also packed to the gills with coin and treasures you can sell to him for even more coin. Much like Resident Evil 4 and 5, there are even special treasures that when sought out and combined will provide a healthy supply of arsenal-strengthening cash. Resident Evil 7’s crafting system even returns so you can collect a wealth of parts like green herbs, chemical fluid, and scrap to make med kits and bullets if ever you run out. All you have to do is be vigilant enough to find the pieces, which the game even helps you with by marking rooms and areas red if they still have items and blue if you’ve cleaned them out.Your growing array of weaponry and power aside, I will give Resident Evil Village this: Despite arming you relentlessly, the game still has enough threatening elements to make your initial exploration new section unnerving. There’s even sections of Village where it strips you of that power altogether and it easily provides some of the most disturbing parts in the game for a lot of reasons I won't spoil here. More importantly, Resident Evil Village treads a line where its environmental design can pancake you if you don’t look before you leap. I wish it was scarier throughout the whole adventure, but I won’t claim I ever felt invincible in the slightest.One thing I’m happy to share isn’t lacking here is post-game content. After what I would say is about a 10-to-12-hour adventure, those who found the Resident Evil 3 remake’s post-game underwhelming will likely take pleasure in how much there is to do after you finish the main game. For the production buffs, there’s a lot of behind-the-scenes movies, concept art, and character models with informational snippets about facets of the game’s design. For those looking for more to play, there are two harder difficulties past Standard, a multitude of unlockable special weapons and gear if you accomplish certain challenges in any playthrough, as well as The Mercenaries extra mode.The Mercenaries in particular has returned looking more engaging than usual. You choose a level like the village or the castle and clear monsters in a number of areas in the setting as fast as possible. Before each area you have the option to buy weapons and upgrades with a starting amount of money and whatever further cash you’ve collected in rounds. Then, after clearing each area, you get scored based on time you had left and money you collected or kept when you started the area. You can boost your score by racking up combos, slaying foes in short order, boosting your time per kill, and breaking yellow orbs for further time bonuses.There are also blue orbs that offer you a random set of three perks to choose from like bonus handgun damage or healing per kill. Do well enough and you can unlock new levels and even new perks to enter the rotation of possibilities at each blue orb. I really liked the additions to Mercenaries and feel it will be a great place for players to challenge themselves in a little time attack-style combat, and it does well to round out a wide array of post-game goods after RE3 remake was admittedly lacking.Resident Evil Village presents me with a conundrum I’ve felt all too often throughout certain eras of the franchise (particularly RE4): If I have the means to kill everything in my way at all times, why should I be scared? There are times it adequately answers this question and times where it does not. But that’s an ongoing issue with the balance of power in a supposed horror game. Perhaps more notably, I feel Resident Evil Village does great as an action game with solid horror elements. The combat is visceral and vibrant, the environments are splendid and mysterious, and the story had decent enough oomph to keep me involved throughout. I wish this was an overall scarier game, but it’s still a thrilling one nonetheless.This review is based on a PlayStation 5 digital copy supplied by the publisher.

					TJ Denzer posted a new article, Resident Evil Village review: I'm not trapped in here with you... 
					Resident Evil 8 is getting good reviews!! Hype!!https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-05-05-resident-evil-village-review-an-entertaining-if-uneven-slice-of-horrorEurogamer does say it's front half is better than its back half, just like RE7 was.Capcom hire me as the back half fixer for your RE games 				
					Just cut the back half lol.   In RE7 if the game literally just black-screened to credits right where you would traditionally load into that ship part the game would be massively improved.  Adding ""game designer"" to my resume.				
					I can't wait to see what the final level is. People seem to really hate it:https://twitter.com/cvxfreak/status/1389961600082202631 
					Doesn't even make his top 5 Res game?  There's only 8 :P  Unless he's counting all the spin-offs.  				
					And even then what spin-offs were actually better than the main numbered entries? 				
					I guess you could paint it like 1. Res 22. Res 43. Res 14. Res 75. Res 5 That would leave 6 and 3 being worse than 8 which almost seems like a given how badly those other 2 were panned and 8 would have to be pretty awful by comparison.   				
					what about RE0?  that counts as a mainline game right?				
					¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Maybe... I forgot there was a ""0"".  Was that on the Dreamcast?				
					GameCube and what about Code Veronica?				
					I always considered that a spin-off but I suppose it could be a main entry, idk.   Truth be told I've only played 1, 2, 5, and 7.  				
					Code Veronica should definitely count as a mainline game. And I'm not sure where your idea of RE3 being panned comes from.				
					Well maybe not panned but definitely seen as lesser than the ones on that top 5 list.  				
					There are plenty of survival horror fans that would rank it higher than anything that came after with the shift to more action in RE4.				
					Code Veronica was initially the ""real"" RE3, but something about a deal Sony and working on a spin-off,. they went ahead and named the ""spin-off"" aka RE3: Nemesis = RE3 and Code Veronica = ""Spin-off"" its confusing...				
					Also on pc now				
					Zero isn't a good game. And Code Veronica, while good in many ways, really needs a reworking.				
					It should, in the same vein that Yakuza 0 counts as mainline.				
					That's like the case for the entire franchise.  				
					There's always that turn where the scary shit turns to Umbrella Corp shit and yeah.				
					The reviews sound exactly like what I wanted to hear. More camp, more action, less horror. 				
					Given that they were said there were effectively merging RE4 + RE7, that's exactly what it sounds like.				
					Good because I can’t take too much scary stuff, I’m a wimp. 				
					Slightly bums me out because the raw horror in 7 is the most effective the series has ever been IMO, was hoping they'd go even harder on that aspect.  A nice Alien:Aliens relationship is pretty good too.  Game looks like fun for sure.				
					Shirif did you like 5 or 6 because those are what you described 				
					I didn't play either, even though I have 5 on PC. Maybe 30 minutes of 5, it was fun stuff4 was amazing though. 				
					Oh yeah, I tried 6's demo. It wasn't as horrible as people say. 				
					I hated 5 so much :(				
					:(. But there are plenty good RE games. Did you try 8's demo?				
					The first one where you're in the prison, I liked that part 				
					5 is legitimately good... in co-op. It's hard to get into if you're on your own.				
					Hmm yea I played soloIt just felt like a run of the mill third person shooter I want horror out of RE! 				
					It seems like they are going down the dark path of ruining the series on the path to Actionville excess again, haha! RE4 was awesome but it sure sealed REs fate until they revived it.				
					Good news for shirif is bad news for fans of RE.				
					Bummer, but I did enjoy 2-4 and 3 somewhat. 				
					Shirif, here’s another game to buy this month 				
					Yeah! 				
					This inspired me to play the demo on PC. No FOV slider and I got motion sick 5 minutes into playing it.  No Sale. 				
					""Less scary as you become more armed"" that's a pro in my book :)				
					Hasn't worked in the U.S.				
					long post in reply TL:DR:best audio options for Tempest 3D on PS5?				
					the audio options in this game are driving me fn nuts!! i cant even play because i cant decide if what i have setup is correct.. damnit.you've got.. 1. headphones2. headphones + virtual surround3. surround4. surround + virtual surround for headphones* and tempest 3d audio engine running on top all of it WHAT THE FUCK DO I PICK HERE?!?!  every single person online, and there's like 20 different threads on this, contradict each other with about every available option, so that helps none. Personally, using HEADPHONE + VIRTUAL SURROUND, on more than one occasion, due to hearing random noises, thinking it was something in my actual house.. i've had to, no shit, take my headphones off and listen to make sure it wasn't real life/in my house.(just random creaking, popping, subtle things sounded as if they were coming from my real life home and i had to actually take my headphones off and listen.) dunno if that means RE's built in VRR option is better than Sonys expensive hardware based 3d solution, if it works together or thats how you use the 3D audio, or what... but that's how its been.

Resident Evil Village,Alex Donaldson,VG247,https://www.vg247.com/2021/05/05/resident-evil-village-review/,"Resident Evil Village is an excellent and worthy sequel to RE7, even if it can't quite meet that game's heights - and action-lovers are in for a real treat.Resident Evil Village, aka Resident Evil 8, is a sequel to Resident Evil 7. I know that sounds like a slightly pointless thing to say as a review opener - but bear with me for a moment.What I’m getting at when I say that is that RE Village is very specifically a direct continuation of RE7: Biohazard. That was a sort of ‘soft reboot’ of the series - inside the vast established continuity, but distant enough that it served as a perfect jumping-on point for any potential newcomer to the series. It took notes from a newer generation of horror games, and shifted things to a first-person perspective. After a few games’ detour into more traditional Resident Evil with remakes of the second and third entries, Village returns to the template set by RE7.There are a few additions injected right into that template, however. Some is from the wider Resident Evil series; there’s a dash of the sort of madness it descended into with the divisive RE6, and the titular Village is steeped in the creepy town energy of RE4, while also channeling that game’s action credentials from time to time. But at its heart, Village remains a sequel to RE7 through-and-through - and I was honestly quite surprised by how close it stays to its predecessor.At its core, and staying broadly spoiler-free, RE Village is about four different grand houses within a small European town. The scale is larger, but these houses roughly equate to the different sections of Resident Evil 7, approached in a linear fashion.The castle prominently featured in trailers is just one of the four; House Dimitrescu, home to the vampire women seen lots pre-release. That section of the game is roughly comparable to the section of RE7 where you’re in the main Baker house, solving puzzles and dealing with occasional but sparse combat encounters while also worrying about a deadly stalking boss enemy - that’s Alcina Dimitrescu, the ‘tall vampire lady’, and her daughters.Given their prominence in the marketing, I was actually surprised at how little of the game the vampires feature in - but they’re just the first of four houses, with each house exploring different themes. The castle draws from Bram Stoker thematically, but also borrows directly from Jack Baker and Mr. X, deploying the same tricks that might be a bit less effective if you’ve experienced the terror of that duo before. 
 
Another house experiments with terrifying hallucinations and creepy living dolls, a sort of different-paced left turn that feels similar to RE7’s injection of a Saw-style deadly puzzle segment with Lucas Baker. This section is a masterclass in horror, with incredible sound design and some truly disturbing enemies, the sort of section that can put a horrid knot into your stomach.Another house is more combat heavy, providing a large yet claustrophobic environment where the action ramps up. Again, that honestly reminded me of RE7’s cargo ship, for better or worse. Along the way through each of these encounters there’s the tried-and-true Resident Evil mix of puzzles, combat, and scares - though this entry is less inclined towards the latter.In this broad sense, the skeleton of these two games feels near-identical. With that said, RE Village is certainly bigger and badder - you’ll face a wider variety of enemies, in greater numbers, more frequently, and every house culminates in an epic boss battle that makes RE7’s biggest encounters look tame.Between these larger dollops of content, both geographically and metaphorically, is the village itself. It must be traversed in order to reach the different houses. There’s a good amount to do here; new enemies appear there between major story beats, there are animals to slaughter in order to cook food that gives protagonist Ethan permanent buffs, and most crucially there’s a bunch of side content and secrets to be unlocked if you’re willing to wander off the beaten path and explore. 
 
It’s certainly a more action-packed experience, too. Your first foray into the village is quiet and tense for a handful of minutes before you’re thrown into a combat encounter with a never-ending flow of enemies coming at you. Big-ticket weapons arrive sooner in this game, and with more ammunition. This doesn’t come out of nowhere, of course - RE7’s story is an arc of Ethan moving from everyman to Rambo over the course of an extremely fucked-up day, and he retains those learned lessons in RE Village.It’s here - as well as in the more action-packed segments - that Village feels like it’s most deliberately channeling Resident Evil 4. It feels a little less of a survival horror as a result. Resource management still exists, but the situation is perhaps best summed up by how the safe room storage boxes are now replaced by the merchant. If you run out of ammo or the resources to craft more, you can always find the merchant and go on a spending spree. While his stock is limited, it’s regularly replenished. Cash is never an issue, as the world is littered with artefacts that can be sold for a pretty penny, and enemies drop valuable items likewise. The majority of optional side activities deliverThere are pros and cons to this approach, but directly comparing the two games feels like an apples to oranges situation. The most frightening section of Village is one where it strips away your weapons and leaves you helpless, which is telling. If the quiet, creeping terror of stalking around the Baker homestead with next to no ammo was your favourite, little of RE8 offers that feeling. What it does offer is different - more action, and more of a high-pitched terror as slews of powerful enemies bear down on you - and it’s also fun, well-balanced, and sublimely good looking.Talking of good looks - goodness me, the facial animation in this game! It’s bonkers. It was pretty good in the other RE Engine games, but that element of the engine has clearly been tightly refined now. It still continues to demonstrate it’s one of the better in-house engines around, though still seems to suffer from some of the same issues it always has here and there. Everything looks fantastic from a distance, and frequently looks wonderful up-close, but every now and then a really rough texture will catch your eye, and you wonder how it slipped the net. I played on PS5, for the record, but it’s generally a fabulous-looking game that runs well. 
 
Village is a great game to play, but perhaps my favourite aspect about it is another thing that links it to RE7; it’s a direct continuation of that narrative. I won’t get into any spoilers, but suffice it to say Village uses its screen time to clear up questions and mysteries from RE7, while also working to tie some of the events of that game into the wider RE universe. Excitingly, it also pitches a few ideas for where the Resident Evil canon could go in the future.At the end of the game, I felt the RE7 story had been satisfactorily concluded, but also that the internal lore of these two games was now more properly connected to the rest of the series. While there is a succinct summary of the previous game at the top for complete newcomers, I’d generally recommend you play RE7 first; it will enhance the experience.Some people inevitably aren’t going to love certain elements of Village. I can see the final house being quite divisive, as well as several story elements. But, well, it’s just fun. You can tell the developers are having fun with this engine, franchise, and concept. That fun bleeds into the player easily, even in the moments where you’re in terror.I think it speaks volumes that I finished the game on normal for the first time in just under nine hours and immediately hit the new game plus for a rapid-fire, all-sprinting easy mode run. As I write this, I’m about halfway through on the hardest difficulty. Beyond all this, there’s a content shop where points earned in play-throughs can be spent to get unlocks of things like powerful new weapons, infinite ammo, and other modifiers - and of course there’s mercenaries mode, which sets you loose in the village in a little survival sandbox.Not long ago, I wrote about how I felt Resident Evil 7 was one of the best-paced video games ever made. It’s just pitch perfect on that first play-through - not a feature feels superfluous, not a moment wasted. It is an intricate machine of a game. Village isn’t quite so successful, feeling at once more ambitious but also sometimes more disjointed - but it is more than the sum of its parts.Taken alone, any one slice of the game - like a single house, the village itself, even the way combat handles - has its issues. But combined, it merges into something that’s still special - even if it isn’t quite as brilliant as Resident Evil 7 or 2 Remake. It’s an easy recommendation - though if you didn't back in 2017, you might want to play RE7 first.Platform reviewed: PS5 - code provided by publisher.You're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!

2017's Resident Evil 7 was one of the greatest gaming comeback stories of all time. After the series lost its way over the years with unwieldy blockbuster aspirations, Capcom's horror team wiped the slate clean and scaled everything down to a creepier, tighter, personality-driven scope.The resulting 2017 game is still a series highlight—which is likely why Capcom hasn't yet let go just yet. Its direct sequel, this week's Resident Evil Village, earns serious ""direct sequel"" stripes. The same protagonist returns to contend with zombies, monsters, and creeping dread. His tribulations are once again framed within a first-person perspective, and they're once again controlled by a certain set of moves and weapon types.Sequels like this sometimes turn out well—ain't broke, you know the rest—but that's often because the game maker in question uses lessons learned from the prior game to make something bigger, badder, and crazier, or executes concepts that couldn't quite fit into the first attempt. RE Village is not that sequel. The more I think about its elements, the more I'm left wondering what got cut, changed, or compressed to get this game out the door, because it largely fails to surpass RE7's scope.RE Village is still a solid experience, and at its best, it doubles down on RE7's ""front-row seat to horror"" twists in terms of giddy, silly horror-violence entertainment. (Think '80s cheese, not '00s torture porn.) But as both a video game and an interactive horror film, RE Village is best served by lower expectations.I say this because it's easy for well-versed series fans to look at RE Village promotional materials and make up a great-sounding math equation: Resident Evil 4 plus Resident Evil 7 equals... Resident Evil 8? (In the newest game's logo, ""Village"" has its letters mocked up so that ""VIII"" appears in bold. But it's not RE8. Whatever you say, Capcom.)The newest game's titular village certainly resembles the downtrodden Spanish villa from 2005's RE4. Various homes and shacks appear in a countryside (this time snowier and more mountainous), connected by fields of tall grass, ancient architecture, creepy gothic stuff, and rubble left behind by the town's once-thriving population. Ungreased metal doors squeak, spooky sounds linger in breezes, and monsters and zombies snarl in various hard-to-discern directions.The RE7 influence is most evident with its first-person traversal and combat (more on those in a bit), but it additionally seeps in during an early plot sequence where various villains argue about the fate of protagonist Ethan Winters. Like RE7, this is a family affair, with a matriarch named Miranda apparently calling the bad-guy shots. (No, Miranda is not the ""tall lady."") Unlike RE7, this sequence hints at a larger gameplay scope: five significant villains in all, each with their own lairs full of monsters, puzzles, and frights.RE7 revolved around a single Louisiana-bayou estate with smaller splinter locations, and it felt like a callback to the original series' intricate mansions. Puzzles and new items forced a significant amount of re-traversal through various floors, hallways, and basements—and heaped on the sense of terror about what might come next, should you return somewhere you've been before.This review's first spate of bad news comes from how Capcom fails to execute on this plot point and broaden RE Village's scope. Sure enough, the game's central village connects players to a network of lairs, unlocking one at a time for Ethan to explore in a journey to save his daughter. But those lairs are terribly uneven.RE Village's best lair is its first one, controlled by the fiendish, charismatic Countess Alcina Dimitrescu and her three vampiric daughters. Capcom has been bullish about featuring this lair in previews and demos, since it's the opulent stuff of corset-bound dilettantes traipsing around castle estates with neoclassicist flair. Opulence in the observatory contrasts violently with entrails and bloodstains in the wine cellar. (Whatever they're bottling down there, it's red.)Dimitrescu's castle is indeed a picturesque showcase for the series' modern, first-person mix of action and puzzles, even if it wraps up too briefly and with little in the way of memorable puzzles. This is saved in part by an ongoing struggle to piece together exactly how to take down the members of the Dimitrescu family—finding their weaknesses and exploiting them in cleverly designed battle chambers, all while each family member taunts and cackles. (Some of them have a great trick of dissolving into swarms of locusts, which means Capcom can mess with your first-person perspectives when a ghoul ""flies"" through your view.)The remaining ""lairs"" and sequences can't maintain the same momentum, even if the central village connecting them continues to generate surprises, scares, puzzles, and discoveries every time you pick through its corners and find new paths and doorways. From a classic Resident Evil series standpoint, the biggest breakdown between these various lairs is one of plot and stakes. Lady Dimitrescu captivates with her mix of charisma and apparent centuries of life, and her voice actor revels in owning every scene. Plus, battling through her castle while solving puzzles is the gooey stuff of great video game storytelling, because its chambers and secrets tell her life's story in delightfully organic ways.But the other lairs feel divorced from this design philosophy. The most intricate one, owned by a dollmaker, is also the smallest, and it leaves zero trace of how its owner lived and suffered up to the point where she became a villain—a fact that becomes glaringly apparent when a text document at the segment's end tells her story in roughly four paragraphs. Instead, the physical location revolves around hallucinations and creepy dolls. That's all well and good if we're talking about a horror film, but since this house's puzzles rarely surpass the threshold of ""follow a trail by the nose until a scary cut scene plays out,"" it feels like it blows some trippy opportunities, either with lore or gameplay (let alone both combined).Additional lairs fall into the same rut: abrupt conclusions, underwhelming puzzles, and last-second dumps of lore that hint at a more involved and interesting relationship with the village's looming Miranda character. These lairs' copy-and-pasted geometry makes their respective rooms look too similar, whether they're in a boggy, swamp-like biome or a pipes-and-concrete refinery. In the latter, retracing steps to solve puzzles or use newly discovered items becomes an utter chore of cross-referencing a built-in map to figure out where the heck to run to next.Maybe a producer made some hard calls midway through production to get the game out the door—and there's no telling what kind of compromises the global pandemic choked out of Capcom's best intentions. But the end result pales compared to RE7's impeccable execution, and RE Village's increased emphasis on combat doesn't make up for the game's shortcomings.Some classic RE games have made combat more intense by forcing players to run away from fights to save their ammo. RE Village hints at a similar philosophy in its very first battle—and it's an absolute series highlight, thanks to its insane odds, nastily designed zombies (dubbed ""lycans"" here), and path through various houses where players must quickly use built-in explosives, barricades, and dust clouds to outlast a timer.This opening conflagration also makes clear that dead foes drop coins, and the hardest ones drop lots of coins. The storefront concept from games like RE4 returns, and players can routinely buy ammo, items, storage space, new weapons, gun upgrades, and more, in addition to the copious supplies found throughout the game's buildings and catacombs. Plus, a few of the game's earliest fights are simple and manageable enough to give you time to breathe and notice those coins. Surviving RE Village comes down to this: you can run, but maybe you should stay and fight.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

Resident Evil Village,Diego Perez,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/resident-evil-village-review/,"The Resident Evil series has been on the upswing these past few years, and that’s largely thanks to the fantastic Resident Evil 7 kicking off the newest era of the franchise. Resident Evil 7 was slow and methodical, harkening back to the very first game in the series. Since then, we’ve had two remakes of classic Resident Evil titles, and it’s clear that Capcom has a lot of fresh new ideas for the series and knows what fans want from it. That’s why it’s safe to say there’s a lot of hype surrounding Resident Evil Village, the eighth mainline entry in the series and the direct follow-up to Resident Evil 7. Unfortunately, Village doesn’t hit the highs of its predecessor, but it’s still a fantastic survival horror game in its own right.Although it’s a direct sequel to Resident Evil 7, Resident Evil Village feels incredibly different from its predecessor. The game has a much faster pace, which is immediately noticeable from the game’s opening section. Bullets fly, monsters attack, and fires rage, all within the game’s opening hour. Even the quieter moments of puzzle solving or exploration are cut short by explosive set pieces and chase sequences. Village is much more of an action game than Resident Evil 7, which is understandable given that this game takes clear inspiration from Resident Evil 4. It takes the first-person perspective of Resident Evil 7 and gives it a shot of adrenaline in the arm, to mixed results. Resident Evil Village is a thrilling rollercoaster, but it’s a pretty uneven ride.Resident Evil 7 saw players spending most of their time hiding from the Baker family, avoiding combat when necessary for the most part until the game’s halfway mark. Resident Evil Village gives you a gun with plenty of ammo and pits you against a seemingly endless wave of enemies within the first hour. Because of the game’s greater emphasis on action, there’s a lot more that you can do in combat encounters. Arenas are wide open and feature several twisting pathways through houses and over fences. You can block windows and doors to cut off entrances for the enemies while also simultaneously blocking one of your own potential exits. Ammo can be crafted as long as you have the resources, and you can shoot environmental objects like explosive containers or bags of flour to kill or interrupt your pursuers.Fights feel multilayered, and while the enemy AI is pretty dumb and basically only lumbers directly toward you, you constantly feel under pressure during combat encounters due to their overwhelming numbers. You’ll usually have enough ammo to take on a crowd, but the game does a great job of making sure you never have enough to feel comfortable after every fight. You don’t just have to run into houses and buildings to escape from your enemies and catch your breath, but also to scrounge for much-needed ammo and crafting materials so you can reload your shotgun or make a first aid med. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the game’s boss fights. In a series that has had some pretty insane boss battles, it’s a shame that Village’s boss encounters are so lame. The spectacle is there for most of the fights, but none of them are particularly engaging when it comes to mechanics.The game makes a great first impression, but things take a downturn in the second half. Everything Capcom has shown in prerelease marketing, from Lady Dimitrescu to those mysterious scenes with Chris Redfield, is only from the first three hours or so of the game. Those are also incidentally the best parts of the game. Castle Dimitrescu is easily the game’s best location, and while the other places you explore are still sort of interesting, the game starts to fall flat once you reach the halfway mark. Repetition sets in and you start to feel like you’re just going through the motions. That’s not to say Resident Evil Village isn’t entertaining throughout; the gunplay remains satisfying and the loop of scavenging for supplies and solving puzzles remains engaging until the credits roll. It just feels like the game is frontloaded with good ideas.As per usual with the RE Engine, Resident Evil Village’s presentation is simply stellar. Its environments are true next-gen graphical showpieces, largely thanks to the ray-traced lighting. Outdoor areas look great, but Village’s lighting and shadows shine indoors. The ornate halls of Castle Dimitrescu are hauntingly beautiful, and I stopped more than once to admire the scenery as long as I wasn’t being hunted by one of the game’s big bads. Houses are littered with clutter and debris, dungeons are filled with torture equipment and sinister tools, and the weather is constantly moody and overcast. The game is an absolute treat to look at, especially with HDR enabled. The same can be said for the audio quality, an immensely important aspect for a horror game. Just like its predecessor, Resident Evil Village sounds amazing with a decent pair of headphones, and hearing Lycans scrambling around inside buildings or hiding in fields while you’re scrounging for ammo does wonders to heighten the tension.Unfortunately, that level of graphical fidelity comes at a cost. On PlayStation 5, the game targets 60 frames per second with ray tracing enabled. It hits that for the most part, but there are certain areas where there are very noticeable dips. Prior to release, Capcom stated that players should expect 45 FPS with ray-tracing enabled, and now it’s clear why. It’s not that the game runs poorly with ray-tracing turned on, but you can feel it chugging a little bit during some combat encounters. Sometimes, the dips happen in empty rooms like the grand hall of Castle Dimitrescu. Certain rooms and areas are just a bit too much for the system to handle, which is unfortunate. You can achieve a rock-solid 60 FPS by disabling ray-tracing, but this is a game where the technology adds a significant amount to the game’s overall mood and visual style.Overall, Resident Evil Village is a great survival horror game that leans into the action and silliness of earlier entries in the series to mixed results. It’s not as good as Resident Evil 7, and it’s not as good as Resident Evil 4. It feels like a strange mixture of the two, and while it seems like it might be able to strike a good balance in its first half, the second half dashes any hope of that.  It’s still a beautiful game with its fair share of scares, but it doesn’t really feel like a true next step forward for the franchise.This game was reviewed using a copy of the game provided by the game's publisher,public relations company, developer or other for the express purpose of a review.

Resident Evil Village,Chris White,God is a Geek,https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/resident-evil-village-review/,"May 7, 2021Capcom has constantly reinvented the wheel with Resident Evil. Through main story entries, spin-offs, online shooters, and episodic adventures, RE has taken many forms. Not all have been welcomed, but it felt as though Capcom nailed it once again with Resident Evil 7. It reimagined what survival horror was by using a first-person perspective. Dark constricted corridors, intricately woven puzzles, strict item management, and a foreboding fear throughout, all whilst seeing the horror unfold through your own eyes. With Resident Evil Village, Ethan’s story continues, and so does the evolution of the series. It’s great, people. It’s really great.It’s been a few years since the tragedy at the Baker estate. In that time, Mia and Ethan have had a child together. They’ve moved away from America and are now raising their baby Rose in a secluded spot in Eastern Europe. All is good in the world. Well, for about five minutes at least. As Mia and Ethan are chatting in their lovely new home, Chris Redfield bursts in and guns Mia down. WTF, as the kids say. After being carried away by the BSAA, Ethan and Mia’s transport is attacked, leaving our protagonist to uncover a much wider plot that involves werewolves, more experiments, and a mysterious woman known as Miranda.Much of the buzz has been around Lady Dimitrescu and her creepy af daughters. Yes, they play a role in Village, but it goes so far beyond that. In fact, the tall, big bosomed vampire is part of a council that has been experimenting on the villagers for reasons I shall not divulge. After escaping the Dimitrescu Mansion, the game opens up (as does the map), and Ethan ventures to various locations in an effort to save his daughter, battling a whole load of monsters that include werewolves, the aforementioned vampires, a mutated fish monster, a deformed giant baby, and so much more.Whereas RE7 felt more restricted in its combat (at least until the final chapter), there is a lot of shooting this time around. There’s no denying you’ll be tearing through your munitions like a boss. Village offers plenty of weapons to be found or purchased throughout, but the option to upgrade weapons is more beneficial. Duke, the flabby and rather pale merchant pops up all over the place, and by collecting Lei (the currency) from downed enemies or selling valuable items, you’ll gradually be able to improve a weapon’s power, recoil, ammo capacity and more. Ammo can be purchased, as well as new parts for weapons that improve their performance. Duke is a useful ally who always has new stuff to buy, and there’s even an option to get food recipes by killing chickens, pigs, and fish.Village has built upon the limited crafting in RE7 to provide more ways to acquire medical supplies, ammo, bombs, and mines. Every enemy will drop something, and most of the time it’s a crafting resource. You can buy new recipes to craft things like mines and sniper ammo from Duke. As long as you find enough materials, there’s plenty of opportunities to bolster your stock. Enemies will also drop Lei and ammo, with bosses or bigger enemies dropping valuable items. There’s never a fear of running out of something, and it helps to make Village a better experience for it. It’s a necessary feature, especially as there are times when you’re facing a fair few enemies. In that respect, it is so reminiscent of Resident Evil 4.Whilst there is more combat in Resident Evil Village, it has its fair share of puzzles. Some of them are excellent. There are various clues through text or in paintings, so the answer is always hidden somewhere. In true Resi fashion, there are doors that cannot be opened straight away. Every area, be it the village, the catacombs, or the factory, an intricately designed labyrinth is ripe for exploration. Key items you find are no longer tied to your storage, so there’s no worry of having to store them or move them around to necessitate something new.It is little alterations to the mechanics like this that make it more player friendly than it has been before. Another example is skippable cutscenes. Gone are the days of watching an entire monologue before attempting another boss fight. These changes make Village more enjoyable. Whilst they make things easier, the difficulty itself still poses a challenge. In RE7, I died far more times than I should, but the balance in Village is much better. Enemies take a fair amount of bullets to put down, but you always have the tools to do so.On PS5, Resident Evil Village looks unbelievable. You’ll visit plenty of places in and around the village, all blindingly beautiful. There is tons of blood and gore, but regardless of the grotesque nightmare you find yourself in, it is hard not to be blown away. The art deco style of Dimitrescu Mansion; the mechanical framework of the factory; the eerie village covered in snow and muck; the dank, damp, and dirty dungeons. Everything treats the eyes to a visual spectacle. The character animations are superb as well, from Ethan and Mia to other villains of the story. It is clear a lot of time and effort has been put in to making Village look the best it can be.Resident Evil Village encapsulates the survival elements whilst opening up the playing field. Yes, there are still claustrophobic and fear-inducing moments, but it balances these with the heavier combat scenarios. In terms of environments, RE7 feels a lot smaller in comparison. I’m not sure anyone is prepared for the scope on offer in Village, and that is a good thing. Whilst it’s still a relatively short game (I finished the main campaign in 8 hrs 30 minutes), the journey you go on feels like one of the biggest yet.Without ruining anything, there are elements of the story that people might not be happy with. For much of Village, the overarching story is absent, relying on building the characters of Miranda and her council of psychopaths. Towards the end, everything starts to ramp up. Ties to the series come in to play, and a lot of what you find out will bring a flutter to your fast-beating heart. Although there’re some fantastic moments in regards to Ethan and Mia’s next chapter, I was a bit disappointed with a couple of omissions, as well as how Capcom are relying to much on Resident Evil’s history instead of looking to the future. Still, Village is one hell of a joyride, and some of the encounters are staggering.Resident Evil Village has managed to keep a series that has been going for 25 years feel new. Few other games could do what Capcom has done here. There are some truly stylish segments that come into play as soon as the opening cutscene plays out, and they never stop. Every step of Village was enjoyable. The combat is satisfying, the puzzles are well-orchestrated, and it looks fucking incredible. As a fan since the beginning, I adored Village. It embodies everything the series is known for as well as evolving in a fresh and exciting way. It’s amazing really. Going from third-person to first and still retaining what made the series so special is an admirable feat. If you were excited for Village, I doubt you’ll be disappointed.Looks amazing

Resident Evil Village,Josh Wise,VideoGamer,http://www.videogamer.com//reviews/resident-evil-village-review," Posted in Reviews
It has not been a bad year for werewolves. Back in February, we got Werewolf: The Apocalypse—Earthblood, whose title, with its elongating colon and rupturing dash, evokes the painful creak of transformation. Now we have Resident Evil Village, which bristles with decent, rural souls (the hard-bitten sort, used to living off cruel soil) who undergo a change. And never mind the full moon. In the middle of the day, they find themselves furnished with matted pelt and squatting on the rooftops in packs. There, in one of the creepiest spectacles I have seen in a long while, they simply watch—a steady yellow glare through a plume of steamed breath. In one sense, the image is purest Resident Evil: the ordinary is mutated into the outlandish, but the outlandish is rooted in the recognisable, and we arrive at the uncanny. On the other hand, how did we get from viral outbreaks and zombies—Romero Country, in other words—to this, a different kind of lunacy altogether?One of Freud’s hairier case histories is that of the “Wolf Man,” whom he describes in From the History of an Infantile Neurosis: “The patient with whom I am here concerned remained for a long time unassailably entrenched behind an attitude of obliging apathy.” That sounds, to me, like a pretty good diagnosis of the Resident Evil series, which slides, once in a blue moon, from obliging apathy to howling audacity. Whenever the formula grows crusty, it is injected—usually with a swarm of new creatures and a fresh camera angle. The progenitor of the new game is Resident Evil 4, which came out in 2005 and shook the series to its foundations, infecting just about every third-person shooter since.As with that game, you begin in a village, shift to a castle, and end up in an industrial nightmare. And as with that game, the story starts with a sigh. “It’s been three years since everything that happened at the Baker house,” says Ethan Winters, recapping, in a weary voice-over, the events of Resident Evil 7: Biohazard. We find him in a cosy house somewhere in Romania, with his wife, Mia, and their baby, Rose. They are having one of those classic marital tiffs that arise when she chainsaws your hand off, you cure her of a condition that defies medical science, you both battle a family of superpowered freaks, have a child, and move halfway across the world to live a clandestine life in a landscape of biting snow. “It’s just… Finding you in Louisiana, the pregnancy, Chris moving us here, military training—It all happened so fast, you know?” Yeah, you’re telling me.Traditionally, the drama in Resident Evil scrapes and shunts into place like the ceilings of the Spencer Mansion, its performers sandwiched by dire circumstance and crushed by the weight of pure schlock. But the early moments of Resident Evil Village try for scenes of domestic subtlety — red wine babbling into glasses, tempers seared at the dinner table—and the result, shambling and misshapen, feels as if it was cooked up in one of Umbrella’s laboratories. Todd Soley, who voices Ethan, opts for a lurching blend of the jetlagged and the irate, jamming his lines into odd places and not quite keeping pace with those around him. He doesn’t seem at home when he is at home; an itchy and flaring performance such as this only makes sense in extremis. Luckily, just as we begin to truly dread the prospect of a quiet life—the evil of a fixed residence, as it were—in crashes Chris Redfield. He has changed his look since we saw him last, sporting a long black coat, a thicker neck, and a permanently installed frown. Wasting no time, he shoots Mia, kidnaps Rose, drags Ethan into the night, and we thank our lucky stars.After limping from a smashed van into the woods, Ethan alights at a village, fends off the lupine locals, and reaches a cloud-impaling stronghold called Castle Dimitrescu. Here he meets three cackling daughters who drink blood, shy from open windows, and burst into swarms of insects. They are loomed over by a matriarch, Lady Dimitrescu, who hoists Ethan up in chains, and, with no more than a hypnotic glance, has him offering himself to her, surrendering the quaffable contents of his veins. (She has done exactly the same thing to half the internet, so I went in fully prepared.)The action, picking up where the last game left off, is in first person. In theory, it is a survival horror—the genre that Resident Evil helped to carve out—though little of its horrors have survived. Nor, it must be said, is there a need to ration one’s ammunition and medical items, at least on the default difficulty setting, which means that survival is, more often than not, simply a matter of blasting your way out. This is a sad state of affairs, given that Resident Evil 7—hardly as stingy as the series’ early entries—still provided enough cramped panic to make you sweat bullets. This isn’t to say that Capcom has served up a straight shooter. We still get swaying crosshairs, accompanied by Ethan’s flustered breath, but he has a block-and-parry move that makes his forearms near-impervious (that “military training,” no doubt) and shoves his enemies backwards, so you rarely feel vulnerable.Among its many homages to Resident Evil 4 is the figure of the merchant, the Duke, a grotesque boulder of flesh, with a flopping gut, who spills out the back of his caravan. He shows up periodically to sell you goods. There is a tactile pleasure in the way you plug each weapon into the grid of your attaché case, like a fully loaded game of Tetris, to make room for new merchandise. This being a Capcom game, each firearm has been crafted with care and glossed with fetishistic detail—the glint of a polished slide, the close-ups of knurled grips and safety catches. I can think of no other developer whose guns bear such vivid weight; you could swear you had felt them in your hands.There are, of course, some villains against whom conventional firepower, at least initially, is no good. The bloodsuckers of Castle Dimitrescu, for example, taking their cue from Mr. X—the blue-skinned Terminator from Resident Evil 2—pursue you at a brisk stride, and all you can do is run. The problem is that they aren’t scary; vampires have long been vested with sexiness, from the twinkle of Robert Pattinson, in the Twilight films, stretching back to the frilled shirts of Frank Langella’s Dracula, who was frozen in a deathless smoulder. Any dread has long been drained from the genre, and, whilst I wouldn’t mind a fresh transfusion, I don’t know that a Resident Evil game is the place to try it. Confronted with these sanguine ghouls, our hero just sounds confused. His conclusion, after their initial encounter? “Bunch of crazy witches…” Hmm. Try again, Ethan.Mind you, not that you can blame him for the mixup. There is a bizarre fusion of folklore here, as though the director, Morimasa Sato—who wrote the previous game, whipping up a sweltering new strain of chills—thought that piling monster upon monster would result in mounting horror. If you have seen the trailers, or played the numerous demos, you will be aware of Heisenberg, the grinning creep who controls metal with his mind. We also get Mother Miranda, a six-winged pagan priestess, and what appears to be an animate doll: a giggling hunk of possessed porcelain of which I will say little. Throw in vampires and werewolves, and you would be forgiven for thinking that the plot was concocted entirely in thrall to the art direction, led by Tomonori Takano, who seems moonstruck by the subject matter.To be fair, you can see why this might be the case. You are unlikely to glimpse a more sumptuous, if uneven, visual banquet than Resident Evil Village this year. Check out the main hall of the castle, with its vast compass dial painted over pale marble, lit with a fireside glow. Or how about the forest outside the village, its leafless trees draped with a duvet of dirty fog. Even its poor lycanthropes are a thrill, available upright, in the jaw-jutting Lon Chaney Jr. variety, and, later on, in a more ragged style—think John Landis by way of Bloodborne: dark twists of graphite, angrily scratched into a prowl. There are moments, too, where substance follows style, and a few set pieces stick in the mind like splinters. I won’t soon forget clattering over the roof tiles of chez Dimitrescu, rifle in hand, while being hunted by a flock of giant bats, their cries ringing on the cold air. But these fragments need binding in a cohesive fiction of their own, and the game’s most telling debt to Resident Evil 4 lies is the version of that adventure we didn’t get.I am thinking not only of the “Hook Man” trailer, from 2003—in which Leon Kennedy was set upon by spectral hallucinations and, yes, dolls!—but of the game’s earliest incarnation, when Hideki Kamiya was at the helm. Kamiya kept a diary, in which he fleshed out his gothic and stylised take on the series. His driving theme was, as he himself put it, “coolness,” and the main character was described as “The Immortal Man with Abilities Beyond Human Knowledge.” Fortunately, Shinji Mikami, spotting both the problem and the potential, convinced the high-ups at Capcom to spin this off into a new franchise. It wound up becoming Devil May Cry. I wonder, when it comes to Resident Evil Village, if it wouldn’t have been better off as a new IP. The answer, in financial terms at least, is “No.” Still, reaching the credits, I sat back, exhausted and disappointed at where the series had ended up. In Kamiya’s final journal entry, he reflected on the change brought about by Mikami—whose services we really could have used here—saying, “I easily went into the world of devils…” Indeed, I wonder if we can so easily make our way back.Developer: CapcomPublisher: CapcomAvailable on: PlayStation 5 [reviewed on], PlayStation 4, Xbox Series S / X, Xbox One, PC, Google StadiaRelease Date: May 7, 2021To check what a review score means from us, click here.

Resident Evil Village,Mike Minotti,GamesBeat,https://venturebeat.com/2021/05/05/resident-evil-village-review-find-your-courage/,"Connect with top gaming leaders in Los Angeles at GamesBeat Summit 2023 this May 22-23. Register here.I hope you all appreciate me. I am a coward. And yet I played Resident Evil: Village so I could do this review. You’re welcome.Resident Evil: Village can hurt you too if you buy it on May 7 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, or PC. The PlayStation 5 served as my nightmare box.In case I haven’t been clear, Resident Evil: Village is scary. Which it should be! But it also accomplishes a good deal more.Village is a direct sequel to Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, featuring many of the same characters and gameplay mechanics. Once again, this is a first-person survival-horror affair. You’ll be exploring creepy locations like graveyards and mansions while avoiding monsters and trying to conserve your ammo.GamesBeat Summit 2023Join the GamesBeat community in Los Angeles this May 22-23. You’ll hear from the brightest minds within the gaming industry to share their updates on the latest developments.I said earlier that I am a coward. And while Resident Evil: Village is scary, tense, and occasionally gory, it’s never too much horror show for me. OK, it came close at one instance in particular Capcom doesn’t want me to talk about. You’ll know it when you get there.But despite the blood, stalking monsters, and an occasional jump scare, I was OK. Resident Evil: Village paces its horror well. It doesn’t bombard you with disturbing images or horrifying scenarios. Instead, it builds up to each scare, and they all serve a purpose. Even if it something as “cheap” as a zombie (or whatever they’re called this time; I can’t keep track) jumping out at you from around the corner, that can be a signal that you should be on your guard.I also didn’t mind the scares as much because I was having fun enjoying the game’s technical prowess. Now, I can’t speak to the last-gen versions, but Resident Evil: Village looks fantastic on PlayStation 5. Characters animate in a convincing way, even when that character is a giant vampire woman that’s bending over so she can fit through a normal-sized door. The lighting is wonderful. Dark places feel dark without covering your screen in pure blackness. A lot of the environments, while drab and creepy, are also stunning and realistic, especially those landmark buildings like the giant vampire lady’s castle.Above: I mean, just look at this place.Let’s talk about that big vampire momma some more. Lady Dimitrescu has become something of a breakout star ahead of Village’s release thanks to her, um, size. And she and her castle are wonderful. Exploring its rooms, roofs, and dungeons while searching for keys and fighting the occasional zombie gave me some strong original Resident Evil vibes. You’re also often hunted while in the castle, either by Dimitrescu or her three bug-powered daughters. It forces you to be careful when you’re exploring and consider alternate paths.But I want you to understand that Dimitrescu’s castle only makes up one part of the game. Really, it’s the first part of the game. I think that’s going to be disappointing for some people. Heck, it was a little disappointing to me! Dimitrescu was the most interesting of all the game’s villains. The castle was the best area. Part of me thinks that this Resident Evil would have been better if it had revolved almost entirely Dimitrescu and her creepy crib.Resident Evil: Village, however, also takes place in, you know, a village. And from there you access other areas, each with their own supernatural overlord. Nothing is wrong with any of the other villains or their lairs. They just aren’t as memorably Castle Dimitrescu, which can leave you with this feeling that the game peaks a bit early.Speaking of pacing, the last act of the game is … interesting. I don’t want to talk about anything specifically — partially because Capcom told me not to. But even if Capcom didn’t tell me to avoid spoilers, I’d rather wait for you all to digest the ending yourself. It does some fun stuff with the narrative, but the ending makes some questionable gameplay decisions.Resident Evil: Village also gets heavy on the action, and this surprises me. Resident Evil 7 took the franchise back to its slower-paced survival-horror roots from the original PlayStation days, and Resident Evil: Village mostly does the same. But it has some shooting-heavy sequences. Don’t misunderstand, it’s not as gun-obsessed as Resident Evil 5. But I would have enjoyed even more of a focus on exploration and puzzle-solving. I could have also used some more elaborate puzzles. They just about all rely on your grabbing a key or something that acts like a key from one room and then bringing it to a locked door in another (often not very far away) room.Above: You’ll be shooting plenty of these things.Actually, Village reminds me a lot of Resident Evil 4. That game also has a creepy European village and castle. Heck, both games even have an eccentric and mysterious shopkeeper. Now, if you think that Resident Evil 4 was a bit too action-focused for your tastes, don’t worry. Village is still closer to Resident Evil 7 on the survival-horror/shooter scale.Resident Evil 4 is still my favorite entry in the series. So I enjoyed Resident Evil: Village’s similarities. It’s not as well-paced as that masterpiece, but it’s also something of a modern gaming technical marvel. If you own a new console and are looking for a graphical showpiece, Village can be that game for you.Resident Evil: Village is going to make fans of the franchise happy, especially those who aren’t cowards like me. But even if you also find yourself shying away from horror, I’d encourage you to screw your courage to the sticking place and consider a look at Capcom’s latest survival horror stunner.Resident Evil: Village comes out on May 7 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Capcom gave me a PS5 code for this review.GamesBeat's creed when covering the game industry is ""where passion meets business."" What does this mean?

I learned this myself over the last few days, as I walked Ethan Winters through the latest traumatic experiences in his life, as fate conspired to bring him and his family back into danger.And while the conversation around Resident Evil Village has been focused on the towering Lady Alcina Dimitrescu, curious fans should know RE8 is more than just her. In fact, if you were buying the game just for her, you might wind up disappointed. But this Resident Evil Village review will show why the game is great beyond her long, dangerous reach.And a couple of pieces of housekeeping up front. First, this Resident Evil Village review will be as spoiler-free as possible. The experience of playing this game was one I enjoyed tremendously, and that came (in part) from being unaware of what I was about to see. The one thing that I was spoiled about, and the scenes that hewed closely to the demos, didn't hit as hard, so I wrote this review wanting to make your experience better than mine. Also, I played Resident Evil Village on a PS5, where it played pretty smoothly, with one notable oddity I'll mention below. I bought the PS5 with Resident Evil Village in mind. Earlier this year, I worried as to whether or not Resident Evil Village would be too long. Word came out that the game was going for much grander ambitions, after Peter Fabiano, producer and founder of Global Production at Capcom, told Official PlayStation Magazine (opens in new tab) that Village is ""much larger than what players experienced in Resident Evil VII: Biohazard.""Then I got my hands on Resident Evil Village, and pleasantly discovered the game is just-long-enough. Friends finished the game before I could, ending it in 8 or 9 hours. Which was just as long as RE7 is rated for on How Long To Beat (opens in new tab). And I wound up spending more time in it, finishing it in 12 hours and 20 minutes, and still loving it. Unlike how I played Resident Evil 7, I found myself obsessed with treasure hunting in the village and castles, for making the most of my trips to the shop and getting upgrades for weapons.Resident Evil Village never wore out its welcome throughout that entire time, and I actually found myself going back to replay bosses, for loot-hunting related ideas.I won't spoil the events of the start of the game, but it's safe to say that Ethan, his wife Mia, and their infant child Rose are besieged by a group of rude houseguests. And their arrival quickly brings you to the titular village in Resident Evil Village, a wide-ranging plot of acreage in an un-named European country — where everything is wrong.Lycans, aka werewolves, litter the alleys like drunks on Santacon week. Puzzles dare you to unlock their secrets. And then, a giant with a massive weapon shows up, in case you haven't screamed aloud yet. All this, you endure, to try and piece Ethan's family back together. And the city is so lovingly laid out and designed that I couldn't help but enjoy myself, even when I had trouble navigating things. I blame myself for that, mostly, as I rarely tend to use the in-game maps as much as I should, something I later learned navigating Castle Dimitrescu. Covered in golden opulence, with all sorts of secrets to discover, this level is so well-designed (it may be the best of the bunch) that you may never want to leave.As mentioned above, Lady Dimitrescu has been the talk of the town when it comes to Resident Evil Village, but she's far from the only memorable figure in the game. Most notably, the second castle of Resident Evil Village has possibly the most shocking moment in the entire game. I had it slightly spoiled for me, so I won't dare even suggest what frights await you. What I can say, though, is that multiple people I know verbally exclaimed ""Nope!"" at the TV, upon first sight of a certain monstrosity. You'll see vampires, werewolves, mechanically-enhanced weirdos, mutations and more. It all snaps together as a love-letter to monster movies, and one that you probably won't play just once.And that's not even the final boss of that castle, but a mid-boss who killed me at least twice. Those moments highlight to me why Resident Evil Village is such a success: the game has such a range of variety that it always keeps you on your toes. It's arguable that there is too much of the chases that are synonymous with the Resident Evil series, but each villain's attacks are varied enough that I didn't find myself bored at the slightest. Village also seems to be a bit more finely-tuned for its frights than Resident Evil 7: Biohazard was. While that game was all about the haunted house jump-scares, and hitting you as often as possible with them, Village spreads its horrors out a bit more evenly, so that everything has more time to breathe (and for you to take a deep breath or two). While we used to watch X-Files with the lights off, for a sense of dread and immersion, many will probably play Resident Evil Village similarly. Instead, I recommend you play Resident Evil Village with headphones on — and on the PS5 — for a different reason. The sound design of the game is so well done, that I found it essential to my survival. This is mostly because of the PS5's 3D Audio, which helped me hear where the lycans and other threats to Ethan Winters' life were coming from. And that's a big deal because the attacks are coming from all around you, and I found my access to medical supplies dwindling late in the game. My biggest gripe with Resident Evil Village is that the third act of the game doesn't feel nearly as clever as the rest of the action. The gameplay moves over to shooting, shooting and more shooting, especially in the penultimate section. And too much of that feels a lot less engaging.I also found it weird that one of the big PlayStation 5 titles had so much pop-in — the weird visual glitch where items in your point of view just 'pop' into the scene. This may be a hazard of games that are designed for multiple consoles, as Resident Evil Village isn't a PS5 exclusive.I try and stick to a strong sleep schedule, with bedtimes and such, but Resident Evil Village shattered my ability to stop put down the controller and stop playing. One night I stayed up late watching a friend streaming it on Twitch, howling at his shocked reactions to the game's events.Resident Evil Village is the most engrossing game I've played in forever, with a twisted labyrinthine story that hooks you in and pulls you down rabbit hole after rabbit hole.

Resident Evil Village,Richard Allen,GamingTrend,https://gamingtrend.com/resident-evil-village-combines-horror-and-action-to-create-one-of-the-best-entries-in-the-long-running_series/feature/reviews/,"I’ll be the first to admit that I had extreme reservations when I first learned that the Resident Evil series was switching to a first person perspective. I struggled believing that the core gameplay loop of the Resident Evil series would be retained with such a drastic perspective change and held off playing Biohazard for a couple of years. Thankfully, when I finally talked myself into giving RE7 a try, I realized that many of my fears were unfounded. RE7 not only retained what made the series special despite the perspective change, but was genuinely frightening throughout its entire campaign.As a huge fan of the series, I had awaited every entry with anticipation since I first laid eyes on a playable PlayStation 1 demo of the original Resident Evil outside a game store in a now defunct mall. RE7 was the first time I hadn’t felt excited for a new Resident Evil entry, but I’m glad to say that after getting over my short-sightedness and giving the game a try, I was back to eagerly awaiting the release of Resident Evil Village, which looked to be the perfect combination of RE7 and previous entries.Picking up where RE7 ended, players are once again put in control of Ethan Winters, who now lives in England with Mia and his daughter Rose after being relocated by Chris Redfield after the events in Louisiana.  The story begins with a beautifully animated fairy tale opening which segues into Ethan’s new life as he and Mia are preparing to put Rose to bed. Of course, the night doesn’t go as planned as the house is assaulted, Mia is murdered, Rose is kidnapped, and Ethan wakes up outside alone, surrounded by wreckage.What follows is one of Resident Evil’s most insane stories, and I absolutely adored every moment of it. I’ll try my best to spoil as little of the story as I can in this review.Village plays similar to Biohazard, except with a much larger open world to explore – but we will get into that in a few. The core aspects of Resident Evil remain, yet this time the game is filled with callbacks to previous entries.After gathering his bearings, Ethan begins to learn about the mysterious village he has woken up in. He quickly discovers that his daughter is somewhere in the town, taken by an evil entity named Mother Miranda who once protected the villagers, but now seems to have abandoned them. To survive and find Rose, Ethan must defeat Mother Miranda and her four Lords, each of which are imbued with special abilities.The four Lords consist of Alcina Dimitrescu, made famous long before release by millions of memes, who oversees Castle Dimitrescu alongside her three daughters Bela, Cassandra, and Daniela.  Karl Heisenberg, a man with a penchant for extreme violence, imbued with the ability to control metal. Donna Beneviento, a lonely woman who has latched on to her doll Angie, which seems to have the ability to move and speak on its own. Finally, we have Salvatore Moreau, a half man, half fish creature who is more at home in the water than on land.These four Lords are what provides Village with such a unique feel from other entries in the series, while allowing this entry to pull elements from many of the previous games. Your time in Castle Dimitrescu is reminiscent of your time in the police station in RE2, as Dimitrescu and her daughters are constant threats. Lady Dimitrescu is essentially Mr. X; able to one shot you at higher difficulties and unable to be hurt, while her daughters appear when least expected and will give chase for long periods of time.Donna Beneviento’s house forces players to use their wits to survive, rather than weapons, and features one of the tensest situations you are forced to endure throughout the campaign.Salvatore Moreau’s area takes players through an abandoned mine and a large outdoor arena in a fast paced puzzle/chase sequence which ends with a large boss battle.Finally, Karl Heisenberg’s area spans multiple sections including a huge factory full of half machine/half human monstrosities and features much faster paced action sequences far more reminiscent of Resident Evil 4 than more recent entries.Speaking of Resident Evil 4, Village also brought back a merchant, this time in the form of The Duke. A mysterious wanderer who seems to have access to every area you visit but is ignored by the Lords. The Duke allows you to purchase new weapons, upgrade your current weapons, purchase ammo and other items, and upgrade both your defense and health permanently by cooking you meals from the ingredients you collect during the campaign.Yes, you read the right – in Village you get to hunt and fish, sort of – If your idea of hunting and fishing is taking a shotgun and blowing away every animal you encounter. I was afraid when I learned of the hunting aspect as I thought the game would end up bogged down by long periods of gathering materials to craft, but in keeping with the spirit of Resident Evil it is really more of a side quest. It is something relatively quick and easy to do if you want to find the materials necessary to gain permanent upgrades, and doesn’t get bogged down in making you use a fishing pole or traps; instead you just use your weapon of choice and attack just like any other enemy.Thankfully your map proves to be extremely handy in navigating the often confusing village and provides you with the locations of animals and fish which you can collect. The map will update itself as you explore and will label all items and doors that you find, but cannot unlock or use at the moment. Additionally, areas will show up as red when there are still items to discover and will switch to blue once all items have been found. This is incredibly helpful for completionists, or just for those who end up lost and unsure of where to go next – odds are heading to a red area will help you find the way forward.Organizing your inventory has been a Resident Evil staple since its inception and this entry is no different, although they have done away with the inventory box which in previous entries allowed you to place items inside and then have access to them from any safe room. Instead, you have a much larger inventory which still can be overwhelmed if you do not purchase the upgrades or discard any weapons you don’t plan on using. I didn’t miss the safe room inventory boxes until near the end because I am a weapon hoarder and wanted to keep the early weapons on hand even though I had long replaced them long ago with upgraded versions.In addition to the upgraded inventory system, crafting items are now separated into their own area, meaning they will no longer take up space in your inventory. Herbs, gunpowder, and the various other ingredients collected during your playthrough will all show up on a crafting menu, where you can create first aid medicine, ammo, mines, pipe bombs, and other items on the fly during your adventure. As you progress, more recipes for crafting can be purchased from The Duke. If you’d rather not deal with crafting then you can just purchase ammo from The Duke instead, but crafting is so quick and easy it really is a lifesaver during some of the larger set pieces.While many aspects of Village are exceptional, the entry does have an issue with boss battles feeling quite contrived and almost boring. The lead up to boss fights is normally tense and exhilarating, only to end up in a fight reminiscent of all previous entries where the only goal is to survive while shooting as many bullets at the enemy’s face as possible. Thankfully, most boss battles are short lived and are decently fun, despite not being all too memorable in the grand scheme of things.There is also an issue with the pseudo open world you are given to explore. Namely, that you really can’t explore – not until the game wants you to. The game is surprisingly linear, although I don’t know why I expected different from a Resident Evil game and well, maybe that’s on me and my expectations. We’re used to linearity when confined to decrepit houses and sprawling mansions, but the linearity feels off when presented with such a seemingly large, open space to roam. Towards the end you do have the ability to roam just about anywhere, but by that point there is very little left to accomplish.That said, the game is not nearly as lonely as previous entries. Aside from a few run-ins with Chris Redfield, you’ll also encounter multiple, well fleshed out townspeople, who despite essentially serving as story pieces, do help prevent the loneliness present in many other entries. I greatly enjoyed this aspect and hope that future entries will focus more on the people being affected by the phenomena happening in their area, rather than only entering areas once everybody is already dead.As for replayability, there are a ton of reasons to give the campaign another go after completion. A new difficulty is unlocked, as well as challenge points (CP) which are then used to unlock new weapons, unlimited ammo, figures, concept art, and The Mercenary mode – which many may remember from RE4.The Mercenaries is unlocked using only 10 CP, which my playthrough alone netted me well over 71,000 CP, so it is basically given to players upon beating the game. There are a ton of challenges, granting a wide range of CP for beating the game on various difficulties, beating bosses in specific time limits, taking down a certain amount of enemies with various guns, etc. These challenges are great for replays as you can base an entire section on say – using one specific weapon, or maybe throwing everything you have at a boss to finish it off quicker. I have loved the addition of CP since its original inception – there is no greater thrill than unlocking a grenade launcher with unlimited ammo and going to town on the game in its hardest setting.For those curious map completionists, you will find numerous hidden areas and puzzles which hide extremely valuable items, weapon upgrades, or sometimes backstory and callbacks to previous entries. Finding access to a new path, taking a boat, and then finding a room in which I had to light an enemy on fire to solve a puzzle stands out as one of my strongest memories from my playthrough.Also, I don’t normally talk about graphics, but I was blown away continuously by how great this game looks on the PS5. The lighting, the textures, and the scenery – it all looks fantastic. Every screen shot in this review was pulled directly from my playthrough. Plus, my favorite contribution of the new generation of consoles is the virtually non-existent load times. I can choose my load and be playing within a couple of seconds, which is INSANE.While some may argue that Village is too action oriented rather than horror based, I believe the game found a nice balance between the two genres. Aside from the last hour or two where the game goes a bit too far into Call of Duty territory, it is still mainly a game of survival where you’ll find minimal resources, overwhelming odds, and must use your wits to survive.Having multiple Lords to hunt and take down, each with their own unique territory and play style, greatly helps Village stand out from previous entries. Bringing back a merchant, giving hunting and fishing options, an upgraded inventory system, allowing the story to go absolutely off the rails, and switching the gameplay to be more action focused, even though I understand that may upset some players, all combined to help Village stand out from previous entries while still feeling unique. Upon completion I immediately spent my CP and hopped back into the campaign, the greatest compliment I can give any game. Village may very well be my new favorite entry in the series.—Richard AllenSee below for our list of partners and affiliates:One of the longest running independent gaming news, reviews and culture sites on the web.The thing that is magical about the Wizarding World isn’t the magic – it’s...by Ron BurkeThe world is going to end.

Cert: 18.Villages can be the scariest places on Earth. Whether it’s remote Transylvanian villages where the air runs cold with whispers of Dracula, or suburban villages in the Surrey commuter belt, filled with the dead-eyed English middle class, there’s often something chilling about a small, tight-knit community living life by its own rules. This is, or purports to be, the terror at the heart of Resident Evil Village , the new game in Capcom’s best-selling horror franchise.Villageis a direct sequel to 2017 Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, a game that introduced some major changes to the formula, the most glaring being the switch to a first-person viewpoint. Village keeps this change: once again, you spend the game peering out through the eyes of generic protagonist Ethan Winters. Ethan begins the game in something vaguely resembling domestic bliss, living with his wife and baby daughter. Abruptly, though, his wife is killed, and his daughter kidnapped. Ethan wakes up in the middle of nowhere, and stumbles into a village that has been ransacked by terrible supernatural forces.The immersion of the first-person viewpoint is ideal for horror games, on a purely sensual level. It works less well as a dramatic device, where things like “framing” and “being able to see the protagonist’s face” are often considered useful tools for any budding storyteller. For all its sensual horrors and heart-palpitating shocks (Village does not skimp on the jump scares), this is a game that is interested in drama and storytelling, albeit of the camp, silly variety.Village starts out bleak, cold and serious, but as soon as you meet the villains, it careens into cartoonishness. Among the various foes strewn across Ethan’s path: Lady Alcina Dimitrescu, an unsettlingly tall vamp with three witchy daughters; Angie, a shrill talking puppet that looks like a cross between Corpse Bride and The Conjuring’s Annabel doll; the Duke, a creepy merchant whose enormous frame seems to loom out of improbable nooks and alcoves; and Mother Miranda, the occult leader of the village, held in religious reverence by the local townsfolk. Resident Evil has never striven for realism, but Village is nonetheless a stark departure from its immediate predecessor, and is, by some margin, the franchise’s most tonally adventurous entry to date. However, the broad, fanciful villains all too often undermine the horror, rather than augment it, and the writing just isn’t witful enough to slide smoothly between the game’s human drama and supernatural pantomime.One can imagine this game being marmite to Resident Evil diehards. There is much to admire: the combat is fun, with a real air of desperate menace, and the design work, both of the village and its inhuman characters, is first-rate. But for those who prefer their horror stern-faced and biting, there’s just no looking past how intrinsically, jarringly daft Village can be.Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesCapcomCapcomWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Resident Evil Village,Keith Stuart,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/may/05/resident-evil-village-review-nerve-shredding-descent-into-horror?CMP=twt_a-culture_b-gdnculture,"PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S/X; CapcomThe action careers superbly through spooky gothic castles and underground complexes where monsters and a bloodsucking femme fatale lie in waitIt has been four years since Resident Evil 7 rescued the series from its action-heavy nadir and returned to the roots of survival horror: jump scares, and elaborate puzzles involving unattractive oil paintings. Now, Village seeks to bring back some of the gunplay introduced in Resident Evil 4 without losing the tension and dread. The result is a delightfully schlocky survival horror adventure that makes constant references to earlier games – and will bring much joy to fans.Things start on an eerily domestic note, with Resident Evil 7 protagonist Ethan Winters and his wife Mia attempting to recover from their horrific experiences in isolated rural Louisiana by moving to … isolated rural eastern Europe. After a gruesome opening, in which Mia is shot and their baby kidnapped, Ethan must set out to discover what fresh hell he has landed in this time. You start out exploring the village of the title, a squalid, diseased little place, all cackling crones and mad-eyed yokels with shotguns, like some nightmarish Borat remake directed by Eli Roth. Most of the inhabitants have been slaughtered by four monstrous local lords at the behest of a cruel demigod. To save his daughter, Ethan must track these bizarre aristocratic sociopaths down to their lairs and kill them.The next 15 or so hours follow the Resident Evil playbook to the letter. Vast gothic castles, spooky mountaintop mansions and murky subterranean mine complexes spread out before you, crammed with weird artefacts, elaborate interdependent puzzles and jump-scare monsters. Progress is made though finding keys that open the locked doors you passed by an hour ago, and reading strange notes that tell you to light fires or ring bells to open the next previously inaccessible corridor. As ever, there are conspiracies involving bioweapons and ancestral madness, and gruff series regular Chris Redfield returns wearing a lovely coat.It’s achingly familiar, but I was still absorbed, thanks to the beautiful set dressing and nerve-shredding tension. Each location is awash with detail, whether you’re wandering into a stately, wood-panelled room crammed with antiques and bowls of rotting fruit, or some putrid shack with stone steps leading to a deathly dark cellar. This is a game that loves to foreshadow the terror to come; from the village you can see the towers of Castle Dimitrescu piercing the grey skies, and from the windows of newly explored houses you glimpse the shadows of mythical beasts, patrolling outside.The narrative echoes Resident Evil 7’s Texas Chainsaw Massacre-esque family of psychos. This time, however, Capcom has drawn not from American rural horror, but from traditional werewolf and vampire tales. The star of the game’s marketing, Lady Dimitrescu, is the standout villain, a bloodsucking femme fatale who brings 1930s glamour and giant blades. Chasing you around the mansion in their swirling evening dresses, cackling and stabbing, are her three daughters, Bela, Cassandra and Daniela – the Mitford sisters of death. Memorable, too, is Donna Beneviento whose vast collection of terrifying Victorian dolls populate every room of her home, watching as you pass.Puzzles and exploration are intercut with shootouts against creatures from lycanthropes and hammer-wielding giants to vomiting mermen. Supplies and upgrades can be bought from a corpulent trader known as The Duke, who pops up around the map making unsettlingly suggestive noises while you peruse his ammo collection. In an unexpected nod to Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, if you bring fish, poultry and meat to him, he’ll cook meals for you that permanently improve your health and speed.The brilliance here – as with all the best Resident Evil games – is the way it switches modes when you least expect it. You can be deep in thought, wandering familiar corridors searching for the solution to a puzzle, when suddenly a werewolf leaps out at you from a previously safe place, or a creepy doll falls from a shelf, and you jump five feet off the sofa. At the same time, it is rife with the ludicrous: weird voice acting, an unfathomable plot, hokey environmental storytelling – but none of it really matters when you’re being chased up some stairs by a gigantic slime creature that giggles like a baby.Resident Evil 7 reminded us why we loved this series in the first place, and now Village has taken tentative steps towards embracing the changes in pace and direction that Resident Evil 4 introduced. It does so with guile and relish, and without ever losing sight of the uncanny dread and pulsating body horror that made Resident Evil 1 and 2 so wonderful. This is a game that does nothing really new, that looks constantly backwards, that doesn’t really make any sense – but does it all incredibly well. It’s a sublime puzzle box dripping in blood, gore and truly abysmal dialogue. I wouldn’t have it any other way.Resident Evil Village is out May 7; £49.99; version tested: PlayStation 5"
Resident Evil Village,Tom Hoggins,Telegraph,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/features/resident-evil-village-review-crackling-action-horror-excels/,"
			The latest in the famous Resident Evil series succeeds with breathless pace and a constant trade-off between tension and terror
		It has been three years since Ethan Winters took on the terrifying Baker family in Resident Evil 7. His ghoulish trip to the Louisiana swamp has been put behind him, relocating to a quiet Eastern European town with his wife Mia and daughter Rose. The bliss is short-lived as, after an attack on their home, Rose is whisked away to a nearby village by a cult led by the mysterious “Mother Miranda”. From here Ethan travels to the mist-wreathed village to find its pockets of old houses largely deserted, except for the thumping terror of werewolves and ghouls prowling its rough roads. In the panicked pistol shots and dark secrets of a none-too-welcoming town, Resident Evil Village has found itself bearing comparison with series game-changer Resident Evil 4.But while its crackling atmosphere and flamboyant baddies are certainly redolent of Leon Kennedy’s European tour, Resident Evil Village is more broadly a glorious greatest hits. According to producer Jun Takeuchi, Ethan’s foray in the swamp-wreathed Baker plantation in Resident Evil 7 was Capcom ‘stripping the series down to its core’. It served the reinvented Resi well, with its grisly tableau all the more intoxicating in its newfound first-person perspective. But if the flaw in 7 was a diminished sense of variety, Resident Evil Village recalls what has made the series such a titan, casting its net wide over its history in fierce action, terrifying pursuits and macabre psychological horror. It exchanges blows on this with breathless pace and admirable coherence, even if its yarn spirals with the series’ most outrageous excess.After that initial foray into the village, a visit to Castle Dimitrescu is a fine example of this. The looming castle is an ornate labyrinth, with spiral staircases gilded in red and gold, opera rooms, wind-swept bell towers and plenty of Resident Evil’s familiar puzzles and doors with absurdly complicated locking mechanisms. It is every inch the equal of the original’s Arklay Mansion or Resident Evil 2’s Police Department, with that disorientating sense of both imposing scale and cloying tightness. Dozens of rooms interlinked with tight corridors prowled by the ladies of the house. One of whom, of course, is the 9ft internet thirst-trap Lady Dimitrescu (or, more simply, “tall vampire lady”).She is an anxiety-inducing presence, much like Mr. X or Nemesis, but one that is constantly on the move. She will emerge from too-short doorways in a discomfiting stoop, before standing up and towering above you with 3 foot claws ready to have your eye out. Yet for all of the resplendent decor, design and the often heart-thumping set-pieces that happen within Castle Dimitrescu, it is but a sliver of the game, as you are coughed back out towards the village and the realisation that Miranda’s cohorts are scattered in its peripheries. In cramped houses, wide-open reservoirs, pitch-black catacombs and imposing factories. The village itself lays at the heart of the game, with roads squirrelling out like arteries to different outposts. Getting through its gates has that clockwork ingenuity that sees shortcuts open and paths intersect as you find new keys, while treasures and weapon upgrades lie off the beaten track. It is a satisfying hub; smartly designed and painstakingly detailed, but small enough to not become a slog to get to the next beat.Indeed, keeping things on the move seems to drive Resident Evil Village. Perhaps aware that simmering for too long in one place and at one pace can create terror-fatigue, numbing you to the game’s scares, Village changes things up with brisk vigor. One of its areas sweeps away combat entirely, pitching you into a skin-crawling creep through a claustrophobic house which has the kind of psychological trauma and imagery more closely associated with Silent Hill. But not long after emerging punch-drunk from its darkened horror, a brief section showers you with ammo and monsters in a blistering firefight across a multi-tiered arena.That combat is a notable step up from Resident Evil 7. It doesn’t match the best shooters – not that it is trying to – and early on your weaponry can lack a sense of impact. Yet it trades off the panic-ridden stand-offs that Resident Evil has historically been very good at. Backpedalling as a snarling Lycan swings their axe, popping off shots towards their head in the increasingly desperate hope that they will go down. That nagging feeling in the back of your mind that you are using up too many bullets, so maybe you should switch to your knife to conserve ammo lest  more challenging foes lurk around the corner. As you progress, you can find new weapons or upgrades scattered around the village in hidden treasure boxes. Or you can upgrade at the game’s merchant, The Duke, who mysteriously appears in safe rooms throughout the game.As you power up, the game does so in step as fights become more intense and tactical. Some may have you retreating down corridors to lure enemies your way, laying mines as the horde bears down. Village also throws up a shifting bestiary, between those whip-quick Lycans, lumbering zombies and, later, armoured goons to which you must find a more explosive solution before blasting their weak spot with a shotgun. And, of course, towering boss fights against grotesque biological horrors.Village is not a particularly difficult game on its Standard setting, but it succeeds in constantly keeping you on your toes. Resident Evil Village producer Tsuyoshi Kanda recently said that the game has been balanced based on feedback that Resident Evil 7 was “too scary”. And while it is true that Village is not as suffocatingly oppressive as its predecessor – at least not always – it creates its tension in myriad ways throughout. Be it in panicked fight or flight or more ingrained terror. While also understanding the need for giddy catharsis. This is arguably what it shares most with Resident Evil 4, more so than its setting.Of course, many might prefer Resident Evil games that harbour more focus on location and tone and Village has a definite sense of hyperactivity as you whoosh through its story. Allowing a little extra time for off-road exploring, it will take you around 10 hours to see the credits roll. I could happily have spent more time in its company, but the game’s pacing and tonal trade-offs feel about right. It only stumbles slightly in its denouement, where a trip to the outskirts and a multi-levelled factory sags a little before a breakneck finale that feels over too quickly.All the while it serves its perennially goofy story with just the right dash of silliness and seriousness. While its overarching yarn of a cultish village turned nasty by mysterious forces is typically B-movie – and its antagonists gloriously camp – it also travels to some dark places along the way. Without spoiling anything, poor old Ethan takes quite a battering both mentally and physically. And while his one-note man-on-a-mission schtick isn’t particularly endearing, you can’t help empathise with his cause.Those comparisons to Resident Evil 4 are not entirely unfounded then. It is not as genre-shifting as that game – few games are – but it does share a certain ethos and hunger for variety in tension and action. It is very much its own thing too, both a natural continuation of the series recent reinvention and a manic expansion of its long-standing invention and flamboyance. Most of all, it is a tremendous, and tremendously terrifying, video game in its own right."

Here’s how it works.Resident Evil is a globally recognizable horror franchise with decades of history under its belt. After the series began to dip with Resident Evil 5 and 6, Capcom took the game back to the drawing board in some ways, revitalizing the franchise with Resident Evil 7: Biohazard.Back then, I described Resident Evil 7 as having risen from the dead, much like the undead creatures that stalk its dark hallways and decrepit corridors. The franchise found its footing by bringing back much of what made the classic games legendary while switching to a fresh first-person gameplay style, complete with a new protagonist named Ethan WIntersResident Evil Village, essentially Resident Evil 8, is the continuation of Ethan's story. Following the events of Resident Evil 7, Ethan and his family decide to begin a new life in Europe, far from the horrors of the previous game. For a while, things seem to be going well, but it all goes south very quickly.Resident Evil Village is another success story for the franchise, with some staggering technical prowess and a range of unexpected twists and turns. In some ways, Resident Evil Village feels like a celebration of the entire franchise, with various gameplay aspects of previous titles explored and amplified in grotesquely satisfying new ways. I suspect Resident Evil Village will be remembered as another major high point for the franchise, despite some odd story choices and muddled pacing. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my time in the Village, despite being quite petrified for most of it.Bottom line: Resident Evil Village is one of the first games that feels truly ""next-gen,"" with absolutely stunning tech bolstered by the industry-leading RE Engine. Stunning visuals, truly bizarre creatures, a memorable parade of eccentric characters, and truly satisfying gameplay make Resident Evil Village soar, even if a few quirks in the plot delivery deflate the spectacle. Resident Evil Village is a truly excellent game and one of the best entries in the legendary franchise. Long may it continue.Resident Evil Village continues Capcom's winning streak for technical prowess, with the RE Engine's most impressive outing to date. I reviewed Resident Evil Village on my Razer Blade 17 Pro, with an RTX 2070 GPU and Core i7-10875H, with 16GB RAM. I ran the game on custom settings at 1080p, maintaining a steady 60 FPS with ray tracing and other visual options maxed out.Never once did my client crash to Windows, and I didn't experience any form of performance degradation even during the most intense sequences, save for one instance. One particular enemy's abilities flood the environment with hundreds of flies, which did indeed batter performance in some cases. If you're playing on a higher difficulty, this one particular enemy could get you killed by causing your frame rate to dip to a crawl. However, this only occurs at one point in the game, and is easily avoided, and may even be patched by the time the game goes live to the public.On Xbox Series X, Resident Evil Village targets 4K 60 FPS, or ""up to"" 60 FPS with ray-tracing enabled. With ray tracing enabled, I did notice some performance degradation across the board, particularly in areas that were highly detailed. Texture resolution also takes a bit of a hit on the Xbox version, with the PC version offering far more fidelity even on my relatively modest RTX 2070 setup, albeit at lower resolution. There's potentially some more work Capcom can do to improve the performance on the Xbox version as tools improve, though. If you play with ray tracing disabled, you won't have any issues whatsoever.Where Resident Evil Village shines above all else is in its world design. Resident Evil Village represents world-class, state-of-the-art world-building and art direction, and competitors may spend many years trying to catch up to. Gorgeous fog and smoke effects, ray-traced lighting with realistic dynamic shadows, and truly intricate levels of detail coalesce to make Resident Evil Village a stand-out and exemplary example of the medium.Source: Windows CentralResident Evil Village's soundtrack is subtle but powerful, intertwining with impressive ambiance and sound work to create a suitably haunting atmosphere. As I note in the next segment, each primary area of Resident Evil Village feels very much like its own character, with specific designs that are intrinsic to the characters they represent. The sound treatment follows suit, although I did find myself bereft of that classic save room music of yesteryear.My only real gripe with Resident Evil Village's sound design pertains to the English localization, specifically how odd it felt to have inhabitants of a hidden, Eastern European village with modern American accents. I appreciate wholeheartedly that it would be an expensive endeavor, and am painfully aware that this is very much an anglo-centric problem. It's not a big deal, but it broke the experience slightly, particularly given how immaculate the rest of the game's design is.Overall, Resident Evil Village is an absolute stunner of a game and proves once again that the RE Engine is not to be underestimated. Resident Evil Village slithers into your senses with some truly harrowing presentation, and you can feel the love Capcom poured into the game at every turn.Without spoiling any major plot elements, Resident Evil Village delivers a compelling story for the most part, with some of the best and most memorable characters in the series. I do have some minor gripes, particularly towards the end, but RE:V is a meaty 10-hour experience that will be remembered as one of the most noteworthy entries in the franchise.Resident Evil Village really represents world-class, state-of-the-art world-building and art direction.RE:V is largely set in an un-named settlement somewhere in Eastern Europe. The village is nestled high up in the mountains, and as a result, produces some truly jaw-dropping vistas and visuals. I don't think I've reviewed a game previously where it felt like I could get a screen capture every few minutes, owing to the meticulous detail and thoughtful design in the game's continuous world. This isn't an open-world game in the traditional sense, but the fact you can look across the map from the top of Castle Dimutrescu and effectively see across the various segments of the game is an impressive feat.Indeed, Resident Evil Village is segmented quite nicely into different biomes, each with a unique theme, typically centered on one of the game's several antagonists. Ethan and his family are effectively kidnapped at the start of the game, for reasons unknown, and whisked away into the mountains against their will. Ethan's daughter is missing, and he sets off into the endless woods, following signs of bloodshed and gore along the way.Source: Windows CentralNotably, series staple Chris Redfield seems to have switched sides. Redfield previously helped Ethan and his family set up a new life in Europe, but for reasons unknown, Chris turns traitor and attacks them. Ethan escapes the carnage, and resolves to save his daughter, Rose, and ultimately survive this new ordeal.The village is deserted when Ethan arrives, in classic Resident Evil fashion. Signs of torture and struggle are everywhere, with strange guttural cries haunting the ambiance. It's not long until Ethan is set upon by lycanthropic beastmen, and is eventually introduced to the game's headline antagonists, each twisted in unique and horrifying ways.The famous Lady Dimitrescu looks ripped straight out of a 1950s horror flick, complete with a monochromatic color pallet and vintage garb. Heisenburg can manipulate magnetic fields, creating weaponry out of scrap metal at a mere whim. Lady Beneviento mysteriously stands quiet, allowing her sinister marionette Angie to exact her will, while Moreau lurches off to the side, decrepit and more mutated than the others.At their head is Lady Miranda, who the villages seem to worship as some sort of god. If Ethan is to survive, you have to deal with each of Miranda's ""children"" in turn, and ultimately escape the nightmare by any means necessary.The game's antagonists really do steal the show here, even if their nature and motives aren't exactly clearly defined at times. Each boss has its own domains, complete with unique designs and themes, as well as enemies. Dimitrescu's castle is a winding medieval manor filled with hidden passages and haunted catacombs, teeming with failed experiments and the undead. Beneviento's manor is perched high up on a clifftop at the back of an ancient graveyard. Moreau is alone in an abandoned fishing village, and Heisenberg has set up in a factory outside of town that deals in unknown products.Some of Resident Evil Village's setpieces are truly demented and will leave even the hardiest horror vets agape.Without giving too much away, some of Resident Evil Village's setpieces are truly demented and will leave even the hardiest horror vets agape. As you progress, the layers of the story unravel, revealing various twists and turns that tie Ethan's story to the wider canon. I felt like some of the motivations of the game's enemies don't necessarily make sense, and in some ways even contradict each other. It also feels like the writers realized some of these loose plot points at the last minute, and try to explain away some holes with a couple of quick lines of injected dialogue that felt otherwise out of place.Resident Evil isn't necessarily known for its coherency at this point, and I had hoped that Ethan's story arc was an attempt to bring it back down to earth somewhat, so to speak. Alas, I can firmly say that this isn't the case with Resident Evil Village. Regardless, the spectacle is incredible and, well, just plain fun. Capcom embraces the madness of Resident Evil's wider plot, giving Resident Evil Village a demented parade of incredible ""what the $%£"" moments that will stay with me for some time.With Resident Evil's 25th anniversary coming up, it really does feel like Resident Evil Village tries to celebrate every dimension the franchise has explored with Village's setting, with enough meat to satisfy every sensibility. Each segment of the game represents a different period in Resident Evil's design history. Some feature more classic, darkened mansion-style mazes, complete with backtracking, secrets, and exploration while others lean on more linear action-oriented sections that riff on the likes of Resident Evil 4, 5, and even Revelations. I feel like Resident Evil Village takes what Resident Evil 6 attempted to do with its diverging styles, and executes it with far more grace and confidence.Taking cues from Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil Village features a currency and loot system where enemies can drop treasures that can be traded into a mysterious Duke vendor, who can provide weapons and other goods. As a fan of the classic Resident Evil games, I often felt this design sapped a bit of the tension out of the game. If you can immediately tell when an enemy is dead because they dropped loot, it robs the fear factor of not knowing if you really finished off that zombie or not.To make up for it, Resident Evil Village throws in a bunch of Mr. X-like enemies that are far more powerful, and won't go down unless you're willing to expend a mountain of ammo or utilize special environmental cues to your advantage. Other segments limit your access to the Duke, allowing Resident Evil Village to ramp up the tension and force you into a more classic ammo-conserving mindset. There are times when your best option will be to run away and even create barricades using objects you can find in some of the game's houses.To that end, Resident Evil Village manages to explore the more tense gameplay styles of yesteryear while also rewarding the player for seeking treasure, exploring the game's many secret areas, and even hunting optional bosses. There are even special animals to harvest for permanent health upgrades, made from dishes provided by the Duke. Resident Evil Village provides plenty of reasons to backtrack to previous areas too, which often give hidden plot details or those all-important weapon upgrades.Source: Windows CentralEthan notes at one point that Chris provided him and his family with some military combat training for self-defense. Going back to Resident Evil 7, where Ethan wields a knife like an oven poker and moves with the same urgency as dial-up internet, the difference in combat efficacy is quite stark.As a result, I'd argue that Resident Evil Village isn't as scary as Resident Evil 7 — at least generally. Ethan simply doesn't feel anywhere near as vulnerable. That being said, there are a couple of segments where Capcom kind of says ""we can still do scary if we want to, here's the proof"" — and you may wish they hadn't.Even though Ethan is a bit more of a killing machine in Resident Evil Village (at least on normal difficulty), that doesn't make it any less fun. The gunplay in Village remains tight and satisfying. At first, you might feel like enemies are a bit spongey, but a few weapon upgrades later, you'll be popping skulls with reckless abandon. Ethan also has a new reactive attack which lets you knock enemies back after performing a block. Pulling this off correctly could be the difference between life and death in trickier spots, and will be key to remaining efficient in your resource management, particularly on higher difficulties. Indeed, after completing the game, an even more challenging difficulty is unlocked for the more extreme gamers among us.The sheer diversity of the game's locations also extends to the range of enemy combatants. I really don't want to spoil what disturbing surprises lay in wait for you, but there are enemies and creatures in Resident Evil Village that I would never have expected to see emerge from Capcom.There are your standard Resident Evil 4-style villager zombies, ranging all the way up to utterly insane sci-fi monstrosities that you might have sooner expected to see in Silent Hill or The Evil Within. And sure, they do push the boundaries of what you might expect would be theoretically possible in this universe, but I feel like that ship has long sailed, and they at least provide some in-game explanations for some of it.Often I feel like games that try to do too much in terms of gameplay style often underdeliver in other areas. Resident Evil Village, however, strikes a good balance. The broad variety of weapons, the truly epic (and numerous) boss fights, the diversity of the enemies and locations, and the strong line-up of post-game content make Resident Evil Village a true joy to play, cover to cover. Some of the pacing gets a bit wild towards the end, but it's by no means what I'd call a deal-breaker, and honestly, it's almost self-referential at this point for the franchise.Resident Evil Village, like Resident Evil 7, continues to foster my love and adoration for this legendary franchise. It's weird, wild, and barely makes any sense at times, but that's fine. I'm here for the ride, and what an amazing ride it is.Source: Windows CentralResident Evil Village is a truly great entry in the franchise that celebrates not just Resident Evil, but refers to various classic horror movies and other media. I noted a cheeky reference to The Ring, another nod to Jaws, an homage to Chucky, and various others. The game also ties in neatly to the wider Resident Evil lore, leaving you hungry for more after its bombastic conclusion.As much as I enjoy some of Resident Evil's more bombastic and outrageous moments, some of the ways Capcom tries to create spectacle fall flat at times and almost come across as comical. It's a shame because it's proved time and time again across Resident Evil 7, the Resident Evil 2 Remake, and even Resident Evil Village that it's capable of dialing it back to make something a little more believable. That's mostly personal preference, though. There's absolutely nothing wrong with some of Resident Evil Village's more gratuitous plot moments if you're willing to suspend your disbelief.Resident Evil Village is another great entry in what continues to be one of my favorite franchises of all time. As a young lad, I recall picking up the original Resident Evil for my 10th birthday (unbeknownst to my parents how violent it was going to be) and have been enamored with the series ever since. I've seen Resident Evil transition from its humble roots into a blockbuster franchise with mainstream attention. In a world where AAA horror games are so incredibly rare, Capcom continues to prove that not only can they work, they can thrive.Ultimately, Resident Evil Village proves once again why this series is the most successful horror video game franchise of all time.Bottom line: Resident Evil Village is a tour de force of visual excellence, incredible art direction, satisfying shooter gameplay, wrapped in a harrowing horror atmosphere. With a 10-hour campaign and strong post-game content, Resident Evil Village is another excellent addition to this storied franchise and is easily one of the best Xbox games of the new generation.Jez Corden a Managing Editor at Windows Central, focusing primarily on all things Xbox and gaming.

Resident Evil Village,Lou Sytsma,COGconnected,https://cogconnected.com/review/resident-evil-village-psvr2-review/,"Back in 2017, a gaming experience made me vow I would not play Resident Evil Village aka RE8, in flat mode. That gaming experience was Resident Evil 7, aka Biohazard. The shift from 2D to a virtual representation on the PSVR 1 amped the terror level of that game to new heights. It remains a terrifying gaming landmark for horror game fans. You can check out our review of the flat version here – Resident Evil Village.So when RE8 launched on May 7, 2021, I did not play it. No VR game announcement existed, yet rumors swirled and patience prevailed. After an agonizing wait, a PSVR 2 version of RE8 was finally revealed by Capcom at a Sony State of Play.Still, the waiting continued as the PSVR 2 had yet to launch. Finally, almost two years after the release of RE8, PSVR 2 arrived and so did the VR version of RE8.Was the wait worth it? Oh, yeah!The new specs of the PSVR 2 are a match made in heaven, or hell, for RE8. The increased fidelity of the 4K display, along with the true blacks, the 3D Tempest audio, the haptic feedback, and the force-resistant triggers all provide the primo Resident Evil experience.RE7 on PSVR 1 is hobbled by the light-based tracking. The PS Moves are inadequate to handle the control scheme of the game, so the PS4 DualShock was needed. No such restrictions exist for the PSVR 2 with its inside-out tracking. In RE8, you have full use of your hands. This new level of interactivity increases immersion.But it doesn’t stop there. Not only can you see and use your virtual hands, but you can also feel things. The trigger resistance on weapons differs. Going from the pistol to the shotgun gives the additional feedback kick of the blast via the PSVR 2’s headset haptics. There are also distinct audio cues of enemies lurking around all sides of you. It’s a full horror game, let alone any game genre, experience.Visually, the game makes great use of eye tracking and foveated rendering to render the in-game graphics. The level of detail visually is top-notch. Whether it’s the glorious opulence of the interior of the Dimitrescu Castle or the underground labyrinth or the rundown abodes of the peasant village, they all look great.Further, the OLED displays allow for the deepest, darkest blacks possible. Vital for horror games. Also, the HDR allows the lighting capabilities of the RE Game Engine to, pun intended, shine. Combine these two and you get creepy game sections where shadows loom and flicker in the torchlight. It also really makes the use of your flashlight look lifelike.As a game developed first for 2D, they have made concessions for the VR Mode. Not all game elements migrated to VR. Cut scenes remain in 2D and are displayed on a cinematic screen. Some in-game actions still rely on button presses. Small things but still immersion-breaking.Overall, the conversion to VR has been excellent. Outside of the in-game action, they have reworked all the menu screens to display in VR. They look pretty but sadly, eye tracking is not used. In, Call of the Mountain you can navigate menus simply by looking at them whereas in RE8 you have to use the controllers.In-game, you access items based on body position. You grab bigger weapons over your shoulders. The pistol is on your hip according to which hand you prefer. On your waist is the ammo. The knife is on your off-hand wrist. In a really nifty touch, you access your flashlight by pulling open your coat with one hand and grabbing your torch with the other. All this adds to your level of in-game immersion.The most immersion-jarring moments in the game are the scripted scenes with locked-down camera views. As the game’s protagonist, Ethan Hunt, you will be captured and dragged with the camera view at ground level. However, you can still look around beyond what one could normally see in such a position. As a VR veteran, I found these moments amusing. VR newbies may find these moments nausea-inducing.New to the game is the VR Mode is a Training area. Here you can try out the various weapons such as the pistol, shotgun, and sniper rifle. Each has its unique haptics and different resistance on trigger pulls. The other big mechanic is weapon reloading. Rather than just a button press, you mimic real-life hand actions to eject spent ammunition, reload new ammo, and cocking the weapon to fire.Weapon reloading through hand motions adds a new gameplay wrinkle because it takes time. Without a mere button press, you must factor in the time to reload. This amps up the tension when you are in close-quarters combat. You’ll find yourself feverishly reloading your weapon in these moments.A new combat wrinkle is available too. In VR, if you drop a weapon or your flashlight, they will automatically respawn at the location where you are carrying them. In the knife’s case, this is a fun, if questionable, combat technique. You end up with an infinite supply of knives, so you can throw them at an enemy, wait a beat, and voila, your knife is back for you to throw again. Since the damage meted out this way is minimal, it ends up as an amusing curiosity, rather than anything meaningful.Of course, there is the real-life scale that VR brings. The reveal moment when you step out of the woods to see the village and the castle looming over it is amazing. The game’s most famous protagonist, Lady Dimitrescu, is even taller than her 2D version implies, hitting a lofty 10 feet tall!RE8 may not be as scary as RE7 in VR, but it certainly has its own horrific moments. This is a game for VR veterans. There is a heavier focus on action compared to RE7. Happily, the PSVR 2 and its Sense Controllers are perfect for such gameplay.If you fancy VR or love horror games and the Resident Evil series, you should definitely check out Resident Evil Village on the PSVR 2. Here’s hoping that the upcoming Resident Evil 4 Remake is getting a full VR Mode. Plus, it would be awesome to have Resident Evil 7 ported to PSVR 2 too.Developer: Capcom, Ubitus K.K.Publisher: Capcom"
Resident Evil Village,Liam Croft,Push Square,https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/psvr2/resident-evil-village,"GuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpResident Evil Village2021 8.7Game RatingUser Ratings: 381Our Review: Scroll DownVRillageVersion Reviewed: PlayStation VR2 / EuropeanRather than following gaming trends in search of profit, Capcom is beginning to create another of its own: high-quality, big-budget VR ports. After Resident Evil 7: Biohazard successfully translated Ethan Winters’ plight to save his wife into the world of virtual reality, the developer has done it again with the follow-up. While we feel some things could have been done better, Resident Evil Village in PSVR2 is even more intense than the flat-screen experience. It’s one of the launch games you need to play.What we have here is the exact same title as Push Square’s 2021 Game of the Year. The campaign remains the same, its story beats are unchanged, and the combat is still just as fervent. This works in the PSVR2 port’s favour as you needn’t worry about having to play a watered-down version of what’s already playable on PS5; this is Resident Evil Village in all its glory. As such, you can read our full thoughts on the game in our Resident Evil Village PS5 review — this new verdict will focus on what PSVR2 brings to the table. In short, though: it’s still an amazing experience.The PSVR2 version retains the first-person perspective and couples it with so many more ways to interact with the world. Instead of navigating menus, weapons and items are placed on your person while the map is a physical object that can be pulled out. You’ll find the handgun and ammo attached to either side of your waist, the shotgun is placed over your right shoulder, and a flashlight is tucked inside your jacket. Utilising the precise tracking of the PSVR2 Sense Controllers, you can seamlessly switch between guns and gadgets without ever hitting a pause screen.It’s incredibly immersive, allowing you to really walk in Ethan’s shoes. However, there is a trade-off. The game demands a lot more of you in VR, so the difficulty is at least a notch above the base experience. The big sticking point is the reload requirements, which are a multi-step process in PSVR2 compared to a simple button press when playing without the headset.The handgun, for example, demands you reach down for a new magazine from your satchel, place it in the chamber, and then pull back the slide so it’s ready to shoot. The shotgun commands you to reload each individual shell and then use the slide to load the chamber. Are these actions true to real life? Absolutely, but they’re fiddly in practice and you can get stuck in different animations if you don’t place your hands in the right place. Since the enemy density seems to be pretty much the same as the normal version of Resident Evil Village, it makes things much tougher, with more things to think about and added complexity.Thankfully, a series of comfort and assist options can mitigate these intricacies. You can get rid of the stages required to reload your weapons, and a default 30-degree snap turn can be switched out for a standard camera. The latter seems like the best way to play the game — if you can handle it without getting any motion sickness — but the options related to the former do remove some of the immersion. You’ll need to choose between what Capcom intended and making the game more manageable until you’re properly up to speed with its demands.One feature we wouldn’t recommend turning off is the PSVR2’s haptic feedback, which triggers vibrations in the device’s head strap in accordance with big set pieces and weighty moments. It’s really effective and certainly heightens some scenes as you physically feel what’s going on around you.And ultimately, in VR, what you see is just as important as what you feel. While it obviously doesn’t look as good as the original PS5 experience, Resident Evil Village in PSVR2 is quite the looker. From afar, backdrops and the haunted locations of the remote dwelling look fantastic — a huge upgrade over what was possible on PS4’s PSVR. The characters you meet look great and environments remain just as detailed.However, the game loses some of its cinematic spectacle in what is a double-edged sword situation. PSVR2 lends you the freedom to look around when control is taken away from you as a scene plays out. This allows you to gaze longingly into Lady Dimitrescu’s eyes as she feeds you to her daughters, or watch what other characters are doing that you wouldn’t normally be able to pay attention to.It’s neat letting you explore scenarios and pick out extra details, however because of that freedom, it’s very easy to miss key details. In the flat-screen version, the camera automatically pans to what you should be looking at, allowing you to easily follow what’s happening and take in story beats. In PSVR2, though, there’s none of that. You could be looking at what you believe to be the focus of a scene when the action is actually playing out behind you. This issue in particular is common during the very early house fire scene where Elena loses both her father and her own life.In addition, a handful of cutscenes use Cinematic Mode and cut away from the immersive scenes that happen around you. It really pulls you out of the VR experience when you’re all of a sudden watching something play out on a big cinema screen in front of you instead of taking place in your surroundings.Capcom has translated the Resident Evil Village experience to VR in supreme style, but it comes with a few caveats. Some of the cinematic spectacle is lost, and you’ll need to battle fiddly animations just as much as the werewolves dominating the remote village. Still, wonderful VR graphics, welcome comfort options, and great haptic feedback support make it a PSVR2 must-play.Great 8/10Scoring PolicyReview copy provided by CapcomPlease note that some external links on this page are affiliate links, which means if you click them and make a purchase we may receive a small percentage of the sale.

Nowadays, he can be found playing the latest and greatest PS5 games as well as supporting Derby County. That last detail is his downfall.Comments (85)+2 to any of Liam’s reviews if you don’t care that it doesn’t track playtime accurately! LolSeriously, I’d give it an 8 too, but only because it has no trophy support, otherwise it would be an easy 10 for me.Absolutely phenomenal game that would make the cost of PSVR2 worth it even if no other game was ever released. Better than 10 AAA flat games.I would take issue with “ While it obviously doesn’t look as good as the original PS5 experience,”It’s in bloody 3D with full scale! It looks phenomenal. Sacrificing a little resolution to achieve that is definitely a big big step up visually.Also, the camera defaults to the correct position, and big spoiler for those who haven’t played though the beginning!!!!Agree that you should switch to auto reload though.I neeeeeeeeed a PSVR2! This is the real next gen!This along with GT7 - I'd be like the trapped VR guy in Observer 🤤Just got through the first part of the Village when all the werewolves are chasing you. I do highly recommend the easy reload option, it's too fiddly in a high intense game like this.@Loamy Horizon is also massively underrated (in fact, Pushsquare underrated most VR games in my estimation). Get it, you won’t regret it for a moment.Not surprised this is a solid VR experience since they already nailed it with RE7.Also bit off-topic: But thank you Liam (and everybody else on the team) for trying to cover so many of these VR2 titles/updates!@thefourfoldroot1 Slowly getting there with the rainy day fund. I'll 100% be buying one ASAP That switch to cinematic camera for cut scenes sounds jarring - it was bad enough in the recent third person mode when it shifted to first person from time to time.@liamcroft how many sick bags are needed for the Heisenberg battle 😬@LN78 It’s about as jarring as seeing depth with your eyes in real life, then looking at a 2D TV. Not really jarring at all in other words.@thefourfoldroot1 Whatever you say, mate - I can only assume you sit close enough to your TV for it to dominate your entire field of vision.🤣.I'll be honest and say I doubt I'll be getting this after the VR demo.The tutorial is fun, especially the gun play, but I got hammered after you get your finger bitten off and I just reckon this won't be for me. Moving quickly will be too difficult for meThe game is pretty good, but I have to say this is the only game I've played for PSVR2 that made me motion sick. I've played about ten games if you count demos. It doesn't feel like the game was designed for VR. You're having to move around very quickly and sometimes when you get jumped on by an enemy the enemy kind of clips through you and doesn't look so good. Not terrible, but Gran Turismo 7 is the killer app for the system. I finished this one in pancake when it originally came out but I don't think I'll finish it again in VR. 6/10 in VR and 8/10 in pancake.How can fiddly reload be a con when you can tailor it to whatever you choose.Theres auto reload with a button to semi auto where you put in the clip or full manual when it's like loading a real gun...options are all I want and they gave us them@gipsojo this helps a lot. Thanks. There is no point getting any game, no matter how good it is, if you get motion sickness, imo.@LN78 No, I’m just focused on it when I’m watching it.@thefourfoldroot1 Well the reviewer thought it was worth mentioning and (no offence intended) they haven't been swigging liberally from the PSVR Kool-Aid. I think I'll take their word for it.This game is absolutely not for me, I can't touch horror in 2D...in VR I'd end up having a coronary. But I'm so jealous of you guys that get to play this as everything I hear tells me it's the most impressive game around, and it's a full game!@thefourfoldroot1 Speaking of Push underrating most VR games, that Star Wars game is absolutely terrific as a campaign shooter IMO. I could see replaying that many times, and I'm not close to done yet. There's fiddly points to it, sure, but it's all worth it. Having to drop my guns to pick up objects then pick up guns again etc may seem video game illogical and fiddly....but it's real-life logical. Go figure, you can't actually carry around 30 different objects and switch to them on a whim and you end up dropping things, lol. And I'm just in the early part that the review criticized the most so if it actually gets better later on, that's an incredibly good game by VR standards. No idea how the review was so harsh on it.I love the idea of manual gun reloads and such in games like this, Light Brigade, etc. It's supposed to be virtual reality and that's how guns actually work in reality. BUT a game's difficulty and pacing really does need to scale to accommodate differences like that between 2d games and that sounds like where this is falling short.If there's one big lesson to be learned from playing vr games is just how unrealistic video game logic actually is, and how much vr design has to step back into real world logic since you're doing most actions ""in the real world"" in VR games.@LN78
Sure. And you’ll forgive me if I don’t place a high emphasise on the opinion of someone who has never played it. No offence intended.@NEStalgia You are indeed correct. Although, honestly, imagination can forgive a lot. In Call of the Mountain I don’t put my picks away, I just drop them and they magically return to my inventory. Same with the resi gun that returns to my holster if dropped. Suspension of disbelief is a great thing, lol.I’m not sure why “ Very fiddly reload requirements” is marked as a negative when this as you’ve already stated this can be bypassed in the options, rendering it irrelevant.Removed - flaming/arguing@neonpizza I played it on that exact TV with no motion blur issues at all. Weird.Sounds like a strong showcase for the PSVR2 headset.I shall continue to watch and see how PSVR2’s library develops. If I decide to get one later on I’ll have a huge selection of titles to play. And at more affordable prices.I did start playing this and got to the part where your gets cut off. I think I`ll delete my save and play from the start on my lovely smelling psvr 2.@neonpizza No more than in any other FPS game, mate.@OrtadragoonX You should defo go for it my first few hours on mirage kayak alone absolutely blew my knob off!!@LN78Some games allow you to disable motion blur and it can noticeably improve the experience.Call of Duty MW2 looks so much better with motion blur turned off.The issue is that not enough console games offer the setting.@neonpizza 60FPS is fine for us mere mortals, mate.@OrtadragoonX Yeah, I turn MB off as a matter of course whenever available.@SaucymonkIt looks super entertaining.I just don’t have the money right now. I’ve tried VR in the past and while I really liked it (PSVR1; Astrobot) I didn’t love it enough to spend the money on the set up at that time.I’m really liking what I’ve seen from PSVR2 so far, though. But I’m waiting for that one game that I can’t resist and trying to see that it is properly supported. Also give them time to sort through any early production issues since it is a very complex headset for the relatively affordable price (considering what it can do).By the way, that one game is Half Life Alyx. If they announce a PSVR2 port I probably won’t be able to resist anymore lol. I’ve been wanting to play that game ever since they announced it all those years ago. But I just ain’t got the space, time, or money needed to build a good enough rig to play it in its glory.I already have a PS5 so the expense of the PSVR2 is much easier to swallow. It is competing with a possible Xbox purchase. I’m very indecisive about things so it’ll take me some time to decide.But Half-Life Alyx would go a very long way towards easing the decision lol.I’m glad to see the game reviewed well in VR. I wish I was able to handle VR. It makes me sick unfortunately, but happy for those who get to experience RE Village in this format.@neonpizza I think that's a display problem more than a game problem. 60fps shouldn't have that kind of issue if the display isn't mucking things up. I have that problem with 30fps on my display....worse, images along high contrast borders have a back and forth jitter that acts like a flickering along every edge. 30fps is very close to unplayable for me because of it, but it's a hardware limitation of the display rather than a general issue. Sounds like what you're experiencing at 60fps on yours (different but same kind of issue.)@LN78 Neon's very sensitive to ANY motion blurring at all, including in PSVR2, I'm definitely not nearly as affected by the same scenes of motion movement he is. I noticed it in kayak at max brightness in VR, Horizon stick turning is just so blurred it really is unsettling, but I haven't had the same sense of oled motion blurring neon has, 2d or vr. Amazing how people are affected so differently by display tech issues. My jitter thing (IPS display) on 30fps drives me up a wall.@thefourfoldroot1 You know, it first I just left my picks behind or dropped them and let them reappear....but then I realized I REALLY am made uncomfortable by watching my picks drop and several times react to catch it.....so I properly keep my picks stowed on my back now.... The star wars stuff doesn't magically reappear, by contrast. You drop the gun, it's on the ground, you either pick it up or don't. It's not like new guns are hard to find from enemies you kill....which....makes sense... @NEStalgia Oh that's definitely true. Like how some people can watch content with motion smoothing (AKA soap opera mode) on and be perfectly happy. Freaks.Standard version of RE8Village comes with one scary 20 minute scene throughout its 8 to 10 hours to finish, that's probably less than 1% of the entire game that's actually scary, the remaing 99% is just none scary action. I'd love to check this out in PSVR2 though if I had one, could completely change what I think of RE8?@neonpizza I've got a Sony Trintron in my games room, mate. Don't assume everyone else has the same sensitivity issues as you do.@neonpizza Yeah, you're talking about subjective preference here. FPS snobs do my bloody head in.Why does the title say PS5-great? Wasn't Village a PS4 game technically with a small PS5 4k up-tic?There's been like 3 true Ps5 next-gen games. I can't wait for companies to stop making games for old systems, so we can get real next-gen games.I finished this in the regular PS5 version and am now about 3 hours into a replay on the VR version. I have to say that I haven’t had the same experience regarding the visuals as the reviewer and several commenters. While the immersion is really impressive, the visuals leave much to be desired for me. This review stated that “From afar, backdrops and the haunted locations of the remote dwelling look fantastic,” for example. To the contrary, I’m finding backdrops any distance away to look like a grainy, low-res out of focus mess. (Yes, I am familiar with distance blur/plane of focus. It’s not just that they’re out of focus, they’re grainy and out of focus in a way that’s not pleasing.). There’s also significant screen door effect/graininess everywhere, even when viewing objects nearby, especially in any dark/shadowed areas.I’m beginning to wonder whether I have a defective unit or perhaps VR just isn’t for me. My experience is just wildly different from what I’m reading of so many other folks. (Horizon, for example, looks to me like there’s a thin film of Vaseline over everything, while reviews and other players find the visuals to be tack-sharp, stunning, etc.)@Chibbie I completely disagree with you. The graphics are incredible up close as well. I’ve spent ages just looking at things and it is really unbelievable. Yes not as shiny and slightly not as good as 4K but it is mightily impressive@WeirdAlUHF334It was the opposite for Village. It was built for PC, Xbox Series, and PS5 first and foremost. The XBONE and PS4 versions were heavy downgrades. They’re still impressive but the next Gen versions blow them away. It was clearly built for 9th Gen and then downported.@Styledvinny79 This is my point: I cannot figure out why some folks’ subjective impressions with PSVR2 are so wildly different. That’s why I specifically phrased my comment as the visuals being unimpressive to me rather than as a statement of objective fact.@neonpizza Thanks. Already did all that; didn’t change anything for me. (And to be clear, the blur I’m experiencing is not motion blur: it’s that everything looks low resolution, unsharp, and grainy to me. To use a digital photography analogy: it’s like someone blew up a 12 megapixel file into a 3 x 4‘ print but forgot to upscale properly and run unsharp mask before printing it).@Chibbie It's called ""mura"", an OLED artifact, and the ""softened image"" is a filter over the screen to smooth out screen door and somewhat, mura.Your eyes are focusing in the very near distance instead of not looking ""through"" it, like if you press your face up against a real screen door and see the screen instead of it blurring out and vanishing like it's not there. It has to do with your focus distance being too near, so you're seeing the filter and the mura instead of looking through it. Lowering the brightness may help. Setting the IPD correctly may help. If you wear glasses in real life, you likely need (but may be able to not) do so in VR as well, as the focal distance in VR is NOT the screen (that's the problem) it's the actual distance being represented as if it were real life.Some people never get over it though, and dislike OLED based VR because of the mura, preferring the visibly sharper LED screens (like Occulus) however, those then have a stronger screen door effect. 8k and PS7 may be the ticket.....People's subjective impressions are different mostly because of everyone's eyes being different and VR can REALLY bring out problems with your vision that you never realized you had! It's like audio....everyone hears differnetly but we never realize we all see and hear differently until we compare these tiny details.@neonpizza Heh. I haven't seen a CRT or Plasma in 20 years. I imagine it'll be another 20 years before I see anything 120Hz any more than a VR game or two as a novelty  Trouble is I won't be able to see anything else by then anyway PS5 Pro won't do 90-120 regularly. Most devs are going to drag PS5 down to 30 again with more graphics features, and even if there's a Pro (there won't be) it'll just buy us 60fps again. We're not going to be on the 90-120 trend for decades as mainstream. The majority of displays sold are still 60fps max.@Chibbie Also, some games are lower res. I don't think Horizon is running max res, so it does have some soft edges in places. Also in VR, the anti-aliasing techniques we take for granted in 2D look more obvious because we're seeing thous softened edges in 3D.Same with GT7, the more demanding games aren't necessarily running 4k. A game like Song in the Smoke (try the demo) however should be razor sharp. That's a good test. Try it. If it's not tack sharp, it's not the game resolution that's an issue.@Chibbie
I was really impressed with the visuals of resi, but you are right Horizon seemed blurry. That was until I turned snap turning in. I found it was only blurry with smooth locomotion combined with lateral head motion for some reason. I’m starting to think that turning my headset a normal speed might cause the heavier screen visor to move at a slightly different speed so it temporarily comes out of alignment with my eyes until my head is stationary again.Even stranger, when I got to the snow levels, the blur all but disappeared entirely. Weird.@neonpizza
Yeah, I remember getting my first LCD screen after having a CRT for years. I was convinced there was something seriously wrong with it. Looked awful. And I agree about even flat screen (O)LED, try watching football on it and the camera motion just makes everything a mess.It’s got better of course, but CRT was so much better in many ways. Pretty much every way in fact, going by what is likely poor memory.@NEStalgia Thanks for the suggestion! I’m playing the demo of Song in the Smoke now: seems like a cool game. Unfortunately, it still to me has the same graininess/blur/low-res/haze as every other game I’ve tried thus far.I’m going to exchange/return mine and try another unit: while visuals are somewhat subjective, of course, what I’m experiencing is just miles away from the “incredible, amazing, etc.” graphics that others are apparently experiencing. Mine is “fine” at best (and less than fine as to certain aspects of image quality). So, my hope is that there’s something wrong with my unit and that a new one will have the outstanding image quality that others are describing.I'm saving this bad boy for when I get bored with all my gimmicky VR games as something like this deserves my full attention.@NEStalgia I freaking love that Star Wars game. I ended up playing it more than Horizon, which is great, but I have yet to finish it. In contrast, I’ve already replayed some sections of Galaxy’s Edge. I think being a massive Star Wars fan helps (I’ve wanted to “inhabit” that universe for 40 years). My only nit is that it takes place in the Disney time period, which I don’t care for, but that’s a minor thing. I hope they do another set during the OT. I’d die 😂To get on topic, I only just started RE for the first time (I only bought it when I found out they were doing a VR patch. The last RE game I played was Resident Evil… the first one 😂). So far it’s the only one to get me a tiny bit motion sick, so we’ll see how it goes. It looks amazing, though.I got DESTROYED in Hardcore mode 🤣I tried the demo briefly, but stopped mid way through the tutorial… I got to where you learn how to use the flashlight and medicine. I accidentally dropped the medicine and couldn’t find it after that so I couldn’t progress with the tutorial… I’m really not sure I’ll be picking it up. I’ve never been the biggest RE fan. Nothing against horror games and I really REALLY wanted to like this with all the great things I heard, I just feel like it’s too much. I felt like too much I’d thrown at me at once. I found myself constantly trying to figure out where each weapon/item is stored. Maybe it’s just a learning curve and I need to give it another chance.This is one of those times where I can honestly say I'm next level when it comes to reloding pherhaps maybe the whole game seeing as im breezing through my first ever re8 playthrough on hard-core with no VR antisickness features like damn I didn't think anyone was struggling (with weapon placement reload at least, tip: you can also avoid the slide pull back if you reload early. The shotgun imo though is the easiest and most fun to reload anyway. Pretty sure I have clip that I could make into something but I have no idea how to add it here.@Chibbie in honesty the outstanding image quality and graphics largely comes from being compared to other VR headsets, and speaking from experience this is most definitely true its currently the best imo especially at its price bracket.Capcom have long been my favourite developer. They might not always get it right (RE6) but in my opinion they pretty much constantly hit home runs. I’ve played Village through about 12 times now and I wish I could afford VR so I could experience this.@OrtadragoonX The Ps4 version is hardly a ‘heavy downgrade’. The only significant difference between PS4 and Ps5 versions are haptic feedback , marginally better textures and Ray tracing. Ray tracing is the most immediately noticeable. Both versions have rock solid frame rates. At launch, the ps4 version had a more consistent frame rate. I’ve played through both versions a half dozen times each.
Either way it’s a fantastic looking game. With a few exceptions, Capcom’s games are always graphically elite!I played PC VR mod some time ago and even with the limitations of just using a VR mod it was great, although it was better to drop to normal screen gameplay wise for some points.Some games can make VR worth while by them selves if the game really gels, For me that game is NMS. If you have a full wheel set-up I think GT7 will be all some folks need to get value out of a headset. Games like RE don't have that staying power but they fill in the gaps.It’s a working full version of the game in VR, but I’m finding it glitchy.As I always say, there is a big difference between a game designed to be exclusively VR, and a 2D game that has been patched after the fact.They always feel like they were created by modders rather than a developer.There are many problems, cutscenes in VR are a mess, and when I pick up an object in a dark location, my torch remains floating in mid air down below so I have to try to hold the object down in front of the ghostly floating torch.Just lots of jank like that really.RE4 VR on Quest 2 didn’t look anywhere near as good, but was a lot more solid.Given that the 2D version only scored 8’s, I’d probably knock a point off and give VR mode a 7.@Chibbie It's possible it's a defect. I can't say no, my first Virtual Boy had a screen problem I had to exchange it for!Buuut... I'm still betting this has something to do with how you're wearing or adjusting it.. Song in Smoke should be very sharp and smooth (not as sharp as a 4k 2d screen. Vr can't do that yet both in terms of resolution, rendering power, and how anti aliasing techniques look in vr with depth... But its still a noticably sharp game compared to many. You could be seeing mura with the mention of grain. But lie res, haze, etc sounds like you're looking at the wrong part/wrong angle of the fresnel lens. Those lenses have that effect at the wrong angle. Remind me to describe how I put it on, later, as the past day or so I found an even sweeter sweet spot than the one I had and thought was right and now even the far edges are only somewhat soft and not blurry with fresnel rings showing....Just finished this last night. It was intense indeed.Regarding the reloading, it was tricky at first but once you get the knack for it, it adds so much tension to big fights I'd recommend leaving it manual. There's nothing like sprinting away from angry lycans while desperately shoving shells into a shotty. Doing the bolt on the sniper and nailing a boss in their weakspot chef's kiss.Bet that intro escape is still frustrating as fudge in vr!!!@TeapotBuddha
Hi there. As you finished this already, could you please confirm for me whether you get the same shop as at the end as in the flat version?This will really impact replayability if not. Apparently you get some things but not others.
My desire to play the game is already drastically reduced without the multi-completion trophy campaign of the flat version, without this gameplay loop of the completion shop it would drop even further.I did the basement section of House of Beneviento last night and experienced moments of pure, distilled panic and fear. People who played the game will know what I'm talking about.I'm currently playing through Village for the first time (in VR) and while I have quite a few grievances with it (which I won't put here so the fanboys don't sling poop at me), I do want to finish it just once in VR. No more than that since there is no trophy support and I'm shallow. One very severe issue though is that when I'm moving with full locomotion and turning with smooth turning enabled simultaneously, both movement and turning stop dead if my right stick is pushed even slightly upwards during left/right rotation. This also occurs in No Man's Sky (though it slows down rotation rather than killing it in NMS). Can anyone please confirm if this happens for them too, before I contact Sony for a replacement/refund?@Chibbie I have felt very much like yourself, it's very frustrating and doubly annoying when people mock you and keep telling you that you're not in the damn sweet spot, overlooking the IPD adjustment, not looking in the centre of the lenses or expecting too much.In my case I've come to the conclusion that the display quality is in fact pretty good. The Cars in the GT7 Showroom mode are pretty sharp, as are the graphics in Moss. So I have the sweet spot and IPD dialled in. What I'm struggling with is not seeing the high resolution, almost black and white, Mura. It's there in well lit and dark scenes.So for me it's worth hanging on to, despite not being as impressed as I thought I'd be. But if you can't get anything to look crisp and have tried the obvious, go for a return. It's possible something is out of alignment. Good luck.BTW, I'm not having a pop at folks who are genuinely trying to help.@thefourfoldroot1 I'm afraid I can't answer that fully, as I never played in flat! For what it's worth, after the credits, it allowed me to make a completion save for a new game +, but no shop appeared. I presume the bonuses applied are strictly tied to the goat collectables which probably carry over?I'll be bummed if we can't unlock infinite ammo and such as I've been led to believe you can in flat. Wanted to start another run and let rip I may well start another run tonight so I'll get back to you if if I find anything upon doing so.@TeapotBuddha
I believe, in flat mode, for completing on various difficulties you get access to purchase guns and infinite ammo guns for subsequent playthroughs. I think I’ve heard there is a general infinite ammo toggle maybe but no gun specific shop. It’s really unclear. And Capcom refuse to answer questions about whether they are adding trophies/shop or care.I’m just not playing it anymore unless it’s the full game. As good as I know it is, I’d be pissed off through my whole playthrough that things are being denied me and the replay value is destroyed.@SJBUK It sounds like you know exactly what to look out for and have it locked in for other games so, unfortunately, I’d have to conclude you have a faulty unit. I myself haven’t encountered Mura at all for example, at least not that I noticed, so I can’t imagine your experience would be so different with a working headset.@KeldorTheCursed Haha, yeah, I'm amazed how good that SW game is. I don't get at all why the review was so critical. I was playing the first part, which is great and thinking to myself ""wait, this is supposed to be the bad part??"" Fantastic title!@SJBUK At first I thought chibbie was seeing the mura, but the description of the blur and all still sounds to me more like the lens focus. Or a combination of the two. I see the mura as well, but, at the same time, I found that with the new ""sweet spot"" position I found I actually see it a lot less in combination with a lower brightness (out of the box the brightness is way too bright, it looks cool with sunlight but after using it dimmer for a while I now realize it was blowing out highlights, it's overblowing the HDR at max.) So I think if the lenses are in the wrong position it ends up magnifying the mura or causing reflections of it. Plus you really do just learn to look past it. on all VR you get a trade-ff. Mura on OLED versus screen door effect on LCD. And in either case if you have a filter to blend out the mura/SDE (PSVR does, Quest 2 does not), you get a softened image.For the mura, though, you can still see it even at min brightness if you look for it, ideally ones focus should make it invisible (if the lenses are the right distance) but I think the default max brightness causes massive mura issues, combined with the lens positions.It'll be another 15 years before the tradeoffs stop being so extreme in VR I think.@Chibbie I'll post my description to you separately in the VR forum thread, since it's just way too long to post here!@NEStalgia Thanks! I’ll keep an eye out for it.@thefourfoldroot1 It's really hard to know whether to return or not, always the chance I'll get a worse one! Mura seems worse than I had on the PSVR1, it was the SD that was noticeable on that. I've not noticed SD on PSVR2, I suppose partly because it's hardly visible due to the res bump and partly because the mura masks it.I suppose I could buy another and return the worse one under the 30 days. Feels a bit cheeky, though.@NEStalgia Agreed, there's always a trade-off to be had, we're not going to get VR perfection at £520. I've only had a PSVR1 to compare with, though, and although PSVR2 is undoubtedly a great improvement, something just seems off.Does sound like @Chibbie has a different issue, though. Although I get the expected blurring around the edges the sweet spot is good.@SJBUK Yeah, I think the motion blur is part of what seems ""off"" at least in some games, though it's endemic to OLED in HDR running below high fps. PSVR1 wasn't HDR, so that problem was avoided more (and other headsets use LCD, but then they have SDE issues and poor contrast, and nowhere near the brightness.)Though you're noticing the mura more, which is harder to tell if that means a particularly bad display, or just your vision or how it's lining up (do play with the distance of the visor from the eyes though, extending it in or out another click or so....I think that greatly affects where the eyes focus and see the mura, depending on how bad it is.) I think one other thing that makes the PSVR2 different from 1 and some other headsets is there's a filter applied to the display itself that softens the image slightly so as to blend out the SDE. The perception of sharpness of say, Quest 2 is lost somewhat, but at the gain of losing the SDE.The other thing is the continuation of the fresnel lenses. They suck. No way around it. But AFAIK, you can't actually use pancake lenses with OLED displays for some reason, so it all comes back to the tradeoff of putting up with fresnel, or losing the high contrast and deep blacks....sigh.@NEStalgia I don't think it's my vision, though I do wear glasses which might magnify the issue a little. I've tried moving the headset in and out and it doesn't seem to make a difference. I've finally got around to playing Kayak at night and the Mura is quite noticeable but doesn't make it unplayable, so it seems I've not got it as bad as some. Just watched a couple of through the lens videos on Youtube. One is pretty much what I'm seeing, the other looked pretty good to me, didn't even notice it.I was prepared for the fresnel issues. I guess we'd have been talking another £50+ for pancake lenses and maybe sacrificed a little brightness and FOV. Though I'd trade a slight loss off FOV for better sharpness across the view.I do like the black level and high contrast, though...Bloody magnificent game. Play on hardcore mode with all the manuel reloading to get the best pant wetting experience.@Chibbie Up close things should look high res and pretty clear, but yes resolution decreases with perceived distance. It's a tech limitation. Remember you've only got a PS5 running this thing and only got 2k per eye. Your going to need 4,6 or 8k per eye, native 120 FPS (no reprojection), elimination of mura to get to what you seem to have been hoping for. If Sony release a PSVR3 on the PS6 or PS7 then I think you'll be getting close to your wish. To be honest I was hoping for a slightly higher bump in resolution from the PSVR1 but hey ho... The immersion is everything though and RE8 has some insane parts in VR.@Yinx Yea I'm just on that bit now with Manuel reload and hardcore mode. It's bloody splendid stuff. Scary as fook though. That part reminds me more of Resi7 VR for tension, dread etc@SJBUK It's just the limitation of the tech as we stand at the moment. Being in the game as oppose to sat in your living room watching a screen is what makes VR though. The immersion is just off the scale compared to flat screen. And you appreciate the graphics much more in 3 dimensions. In fact you could argue that the graphics on PSVR2 are better than flat screen PS5 due to the 3d element which elevates games immensely.@thefourfoldroot1 There is mura on PSVR2, of that there is no doubt. If you really haven't seen it at all then.... wow. There are so many variables with VR and people's differing eyeballs, but I suspect you've somehow starred through it.@Terry12
I see a very, very faint grainy haze in areas that are quite bright. But this is not mura , this is a the screen door effect. You can tell because it is completely uniform. Mura would be an inconsistency between pixel colour output that is more randomised, and no I haven’t seen that. I’m actually surprised Sony managed to use an OLED that is so good in this respect.@neonpizza
Obviously. Were you coming in expecting 4K TV like sharpness? In terms of resolution the graphics are going to be “downgraded” as you say, but this is a matter of user expectations.If VR had come along first, everyone would say about TVs, “what! You are giving me sharper lines and a bit less grain, but I have to sacrifice actual 3 dimensional visuals and gameplay and lifelike scale, and now watch this game in a little flat window and use this controller with a million buttons to manipulate actions?? WTF! Massive downgrade in visuals and gameplay!!”Definitely play in VR. That should be clear to you after the first 5 minutes. Unless you are sitting there obsessing about a bit of graininess.@Terry12 No arguments from me regarding the immersion factor, absolutely game changing. That's why the Mura is an issue for me with my particular headset, it can break it. I understand why it happens and by it's very nature it's quite possible that some headsets are better than others. And I'll always wonder if I could have had a better one, especially as both before and after release some people just haven't seen it.But saying all of that, it didn't stop me playing 2 hours of GT7 the other night  I'm not returning the headset and I would thoroughly recommend it, would just maybe tell people to lower expectations a little.As for RE, I'm just not into horror (wimp) so am no doubt missing out on a fantastic VR experience. Might try the demo but can't see me buying it.@LiamCroft
Hi Liam. If you ever get the chance to communicate with a Capcom, could you please, please, PLEASE ask them if they are going to patch the game to allow us to get the trophies in the VR version. This would massively improve the game and its replayability for me and a lot of others. It’s absolutely incomprehensible that they have the full game but no trophy support in VR.Removed - harassmentRemoved - discussing moderationRemoved - discussing moderationRemoved - discussing moderation Tap here to load 85 commentsLeave A CommentHold on there, you need to login to post a comment...32 Games Will Be Taken Off PS Plus Extra, Premium Next MonthSpider-Man, Resident Evil included16 Games Hit PS Plus Extra, Premium Next WeekBig April 2023 game refresh revealedNaughty Dog Gives PS5 Some Love in New The Last of Us: Part I PatchAdds new HBO contentPoll: Are You Happy with Your PS Plus Extra, Premium Games for April 2023?It was all BethesdaNew PS5 Games Release Dates in 2023All 2023's upcoming PlayStation 5 launch datesGame ProfileTitle:Resident Evil VillageSystem:PlayStation 5Also Available For:PS4, Xbox Series X|SPSVR Support:PlayStation VR2 (Optional)Publisher:CapcomDeveloper:CapcomGenre:Action, Adventure, First PersonPlayers:1Release Date:PlayStation 5Series:Resident EvilAlso Known As:Resident Evil 8: Village, RE8Guide:Resident Evil Village Guide: Tips, Tricks, and All CollectiblesOfficial Site:residentevil.comWikipedia:en.wikipedia.orgWhere to buy:Buy on Amazon

Resident Evil Village,Neil Bolt,PlayStation Universe,https://www.psu.com/reviews/resident-evil-village-psvr-2-review/," Neil Bolt / February 27, 2023Resident Evil Village PSVR 2 Review. The biggest name in horror gaming marks its PSVR 2 debut with a staggering conversion of the eighth entry in the mainline series. Find out what makes the don of Survival Horror tick in VR with PlayStation Universe’s Resident Evil Village review for PSVR 2.It has to be said Capcom took a pretty big swing with the direction for Resident Evil VII. The game successfully rebooted a creatively flagging franchise in many ways, but one of the more understated ways that happened was Capcom’s decision to make it playable on PS4’s PSVR setup as well.The hardware had its limitations, and many game’s suffered for that on the platform, including Resident Evil 7, but the murky dark of the Baker estate lent itself well to PSVR’s blurry output. It felt like a formative step for Resident Evil in virtual reality, and proved to be the case when the VR version of Resident Evil 4 (the original rather than the remake) turned out great (hopefully that version will reach PSVR 2 someday). Now, with the far superior power of PSVR 2 to call upon, Capcom has seen fit to transform Resident Evil Village into a fully-fledged VR experience, and truth be told, it’s leaps and bounds over those early efforts in so many ways.It’s worth noting from the off that Capcom really has designed the VR version as its own thing. So much so that you can’t transfer your pre-VR saves across to it. A bit of a downer for sure. The upside is you get to learn the ropes from the start. You will need to learn the ropes if you’ve not touched much VR outside of the original PSVR. Getting used to the quirks of playing Village in VR takes a bit of time. A handy tutorial set in protagonist Ethan Winters’ garage settles you into the nuances of it. In that garage, you get walked through the movement of the character. Left stick for moving about, right stick for turning, and motion control for looking. You can physically reach out to grab items or press X, and combat is monumentally more tactile in VR.The tutorial shows you a few gun types and how they work in VR. It was here I could first really feel the difference between this game’s VR and that of the previous game. You are tasked with reloading a pistol and you have to do the whole cool shebang the first time around (you can make it a bit simpler after if you wish). You grab your pistol from your holster on your right hip, eject a clip, psychically grab another out of your ammo bag that sits on your left hip and slot it in, then pull back the top to load a bullet into the chamber. It’s a genuinely impressive level of detail that adds a whole new level to the survival horror aspects of Village. It’s just as satisfying with other weapons too. Reaching behind you to grab a shotgun off your back and psychically load shells into the chamber and use the pump action? Glorious stuff. And what about the trusty knife? It gains so much in Resident Evil Village VR because you have so much more control over it. The knife sits in a holder on Ethan’s left arm and by moving your right arm over to it and grabbing it by holding the R1 button you can brandish it for combat, box slashing and amusingly lame attempts at knife juggling or knife throwing. Like all weapons, you can ‘let go’ of the knife and it will go back to its default holster, but you can also throw the into the air and catch them or transfer it from one hand to the other. So if you want to wield the knife in one hand and a pistol in the other, go for it. Just don’t be surprised if you find you’ve accidentally dropped a weapon in a fluster.It’s a system that works fairly well. I must say the opening hour of the game, however, is not a great way to get used to it. There’s too much of a stop-start, choreographed aspect to it. That isn’t really there in the remainder of the game. Also, cutscenes take pretty much all control from you (or are viewed on a flat screen). So it gets easy to forget some of the nuances of the controls in the gaps. Generally, that opening hour is such hard going unless you’re well-versed in VR traversal and can safely move about without clattering someone when you inevitably panic. As first proper impressions go, it’s not a great one, even if the game world looks utterly fantastic.And wow, the game world really does look fantastic in VR. The HDR in PSVR2 really makes the dingy dark corners of Village appear as dim as they would in reality. The sense of scale is absolutely splendid. If you were overawed (or something to that effect) by the size of Lady Dimestrescu before, it’ll blow your mind with just how tall she is when she’s leering down at you in VR.The sense of space amplifies the stronger moments and enhances some sections considered weaker. House Beneviento was unsettling enough during that infamous section, but reliving that moment of that thing looming out of the darkness in front of me in three-dimensional space was so, so unpleasant. Add audio via headphones and it’s elevated to one of the best horror moments in any medium.Then I think of the battle with Moreau’s lake monster. I quite liked it the first time around. Even if many found it to be a weak point among the bosses. In VR, it’s a proper spectacle that actually brings fresh fear and uncertainty. Navigating the rooftops of flooded houses, knowing a leviathan is ready to eat you for lunch? Scary. Even the action-heavy finale gets an uptick from the tactile nature of combat. There’s a good tradeoff in freedoms on display that sort of inverts what came before in a tantalizing manner.VR doesn’t always make Resident Evil Village a better experience. Yet it is quite remarkable how much fresh life it breathes into it. I don’t think it’ll be the easiest VR game to get into. But once you begin to understand its mechanics, it becomes an extremely lavish experience. Especially within this medium. There’s still room for improvement I feel, but Capcom has set a pretty high bar for itself with Resident Evil Village on PSVR2.Resident Evil Village PSVR 2 is now available via a free update for existing owners of the game on PS5.Capcom has created a luxurious VR experience for Resident Evil Village that grows in power the deeper you delve into it, It’s a tough one to get to grips with, but this is a shot in the arm for an already great survival horror adventure.

Resident Evil Village,Charlie Coleman,Gaming Nexus,https://www.gamingnexus.com/Article/7321/Resident-Evil-Village/,"It was only on March 22 of this year that the Resident Evil franchise enjoyed its silver anniversary (that’s 25 years for any unwed folk). It’s a franchise that has consistently mutated and evolved in order to fend off the greatest monster of all: franchise fatigue. When you take a step back and observe all the ways this series has grown and changed, across various mediums, it really is fascinating. With a franchise this long-running, it’s inevitable that some traditionalists will bemoan a new direction, so it’s imperative that Capcom retain the roots of Resident Evil but continues to evolve over 25 years later. Resident Evil 7 Biohazard introduced us to new protagonist Ethan Winters but also to an entirely new perspective: first-person. Resident Evil Village is a direct continuation from that bold new direction, but shows plenty of ambition on its own. Immediately, fans who have merely seen the promos will pick up on the similarities to 2005’s critically-acclaimed Resident Evil 4. I briefly mentioned Resident Evil Village in GamingNexus’ most recent “So, what are we playing?” article. I was only a few hours in at that point but my initial impressions were strikingly on point: if Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 7 had a baby (paying no attention to the ridiculousness of that proposition) that baby would be named Resident Evil Village. The eighth mainline instalment brilliantly blends what made those two entries series favourites. Like Resident Evil 4, Village is more action-oriented, oozes style, and pays meticulous attention to detail and atmosphere. Like Resident Evil 7, Village adopts a game-changing first-person perspective, features a story that hooks you, and puts focus back on puzzle-solving and exploration.  The titular Village makes for the best setting the series has seen since Resident Evil 4. Following on from his encounters with the Baker family, tragedy strikes Ethan Winters yet again. This review won’t delve into spoiler territory but Ethan soon arrives in the village that’s seemingly lost in time. Ethan is a far more fleshed-out and three-dimensional character in Village. Incidentally, I genuinely cannot remember if Ethan even had any lines of dialogue in Resident Evil 7. If he did, they were rare and forgettable. The first hour of Village explores Ethan as a character more than Resident Evil 7 did in its entirety. We see his difficulty communicating with his wife over the events they suffered in the previous game. We see Ethan forming bonds with villagers and shouting profanities at even the most intimidating of foes. The Village is a more expansive setting for Ethan to explore than the Baker ranch. Unlike Resident Evil 7, but like Leon Kennedy in Resident Evil 4, Ethan gets his hands on a sniper rifle that does come in handy for some of the longer-range encounters that this larger environment permits. Despite the increase in magnitude, Resident Evil Village maintains a meticulous attention to detail in every aspect of its multiple environments. What initially appears as a run-down assortment of abandoned homes soon reveals alternative paths, obscure secrets, hidden treasures, all of which encourages you to venture off the beaten track and explore. Similar to a Metroidvania, there’s plenty of backtracking involved when you discover new tools that allow you to access previously inaccessible areas.Since she’s already been the focus of social media for the last few months, Lady Dimitrescu makes for an intriguing foe. She’s the first of four lords Ethan comes across and is a Mr. X style enemy that stalks Ethan as he explores Castle Dimitrescu. My only criticism in respect to her character is that there wasn’t enough of her. My guess is Capcom never expected her to become the internet’s obsession the way that she did. If they had, I’m sure she would’ve been given an even greater presence in the game. Alas, she and the Dimitrescu castle are but one of four lords and their abode. The central village serves as a hub of sorts whilst the Dimitrescu castle and the other three houses each feature a distinct tone and atmosphere. Of course, there’s also the returning Chris Redfield in the picture - but the mystery of his actions are figured out through collectables and the game’s denouement. The best way to describe it is that the Village is the amusement park whilst the houses are the thrilling rides. Though there’s not a single thing amusing about the Beneviento house. It’s without a doubt one of the scariest sequences in any horror game I’ve ever played. Now that I've completed the game myself, I can’t wait to watch some of my favourite streamers encounter this section. Generally, these locations are self-contained but sprawling enough to hide secrets and treasures waiting to be uncovered. Every house adopts a different approach to horror or inspiration from different Resident Evil games. Personally, I’m all for this approach. The four houses of the Village, Dimitrescu, Beneviento, Mareau, and Heisenberg are unique; not only as distinct characters and breeds of monsters themselves, but also their abodes. It doesn’t get as distinct as the timeless luxury of the Dimitrescu castle versus the slimy decrepit mines that Mareau resides in. My playtime lasted around 12 hours on the standard difficulty which felt like a very respectable and well-paced journey through the Village. The story offers twists and turns and adds in a personal and emotional element that carries on what Resident Evil 7 started with Ethan Winters and the well-developed Baker family. Similarly, Resident Evil Village keeps you invested in these characters and seeing the story through to the end. Puzzles are reminiscent of those we saw in Resident Evil 2, with some new fresh ideas too. Overall, they’re not too challenging and I only had to consult a guide on one occasion. Like previous Resident Evil games, Village provides plenty of reasons to play through it multiple times. Challenges and trophies such as knife-only runs or completing the game in under 3 hours which provide plenty of challenge. There’s also the return of the staple Mercenaries mode to consider which adds even more value.Mercenaries is only available as a bonus game mode after you complete the game at least once. Fans of the series will remember the Mercenaries mode from Resident Evil 4. Mercenaries pits the player against timed waves of incoming enemies in stages which are ever-increasing in difficulty. Players are awarded a rank based on the merits of their performance. Time boosters and power-ups are scattered across the arena to add another element of strategy. Power-ups can range from damage boosters to movement speed boosters. As it stands, there are eight stages in four playable areas but it’s entirely possible that this could be extended in future DLC. For this review, I played the PS5 version of Resident Evil Village. This version offers unique functionality thanks to DualSense and 3D audio support. Resident Evil Village makes use of the DualSense controller’s adaptive triggers. This requires players to apply a variable amount of torque dependent on what weapon they’re firing. For shooters, this adds to the immersion as every weapon has a unique weightiness. For example, a heavier shotgun requires more torque than a light pistol and you really feel that with the DualSense. 3D audio only increases the sense of immersion. The sounds that an adversary makes are more fleshed out and fill the space in a 3D environment which brings with it an extra level of cognizance that adds to the tension. It’s a more nuanced feature than the DualSense support but it does provide a more immersive and impactful audio experience. Thanks to the SSD technology in the next-gen consoles, load times are blisteringly fast in Resident Evil Village. A cold boot using the PS5’s unique activity cards means a player can go from dashboard to playing the game in mere seconds. It definitely makes dying less of a problem, and there’ll definitely be plenty of dying especially on higher difficulties. Resident Evil Village supports 4K resolution @ 60FPS and ray-tracing. The result is a spectacular visual presentation that really brings the beautiful art direction to life. Even with ray-tracing on, I rarely noticed the action drop below 60FPS even in intensive scenes. The 4K resolution provides a crisp and clear image that really does demonstrate how far console games have come since the last generation. The marrying of crisp visuals and a gorgeous art style had me popping into photo mode on multiple occasions. Having seen how the game runs on PS4, Capcom’s RE Engine is still doing a marvelous job on the outdated hardware. For all my beaming praise, there’s also a few minor issues worth noting. For instance, the camera/movement still doesn't feel completely right and it took a fair bit of fiddling in the settings to get something that felt better. On the flip side, however, the awkwardness of control also kind of feels appropriately fitting for the character. After all, Ethan Winters is not a trained badass like Chris Redfield. The fact the controls aren’t snappy and always precise means there’s still a niggling feeling of tension and helplessness when facing adversaries. Crafting is also a bit of a nuisance with items such as herbs, previously only used for crafting medical items, now being used for crafting other items too which means resources will often stretch thin, especially on higher difficulties. On the whole, though, there’s not a whole lot I can point to as far as faults go in Resident Evil Village. Of course, there’ll be those that bemoan the more action-heavy sequences versus the almost all-out survival horror we got in Resident Evil 7 but it’s a welcome change of tone. Besides, whilst being more action-oriented, Resident Evil Village maintains plenty of sequences that had me crapping my pants and taking my headset off for a breather. The Beneviento house, in particular, is the most terrified I’ve ever been playing a Resident Evil game. Resident Evil Village feels like an amalgamation of what made the fan-favourites Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 7 such great games. There’s something here for every kind of Resident Evil fan and that’s hard to pull off for any long-running franchise. As a long time fan, I was deeply worried for the franchise after Resident Evil 6 but Resident Evil Village is the latest example that the franchise is enjoying a triumphant renaissance. Resident Evil Village earns a spot right up there as one of the very best Resident Evil games in the franchise’s 25 year run. Village is an amalgamation of what made Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 7 fan-favourite entries. Though it also delivers on it’s own ambition with new breeds of terrifying enemies never seen before in Resident Evil. The Village is a desolate, decrepit, dolorous setting but undeniably beautiful thanks to some of the best art direction ever seen in the series. In an age of day one patches and bugs, Resident Evil looks and runs flawlessly on the PlayStation 5 version used in this review. Resident Evil Village is a Game of the Year contender.  * The product in this article was sent to us by the developer/company. View Profile"
Resident Evil Village,Andrew Farrell,PC Invasion,https://www.pcinvasion.com/resident-evil-village-review/,"It’s easy to be skeptical of Resident Evil games. Resident Evil 4 was a massive change for the series, shifting things from survival horror to action horror. However, this signaled to Capcom that the series should be focused on broad action appeal in the future. This, of course, backfired horribly. Resident Evil 7 made a concerted effort to return to series roots, and I was worried that Resident Evil Village would break from that. It does. In some ways, the game is most like Resident Evil 6, but in a good way. And not in a “we changed the gameplay so much that it’s no longer a thing you love” way.Do you remember how RE 6 had a collection of different gameplay styles that added a lot of variety? Resident Evil Village does the same thing, albeit while utilizing series components within the general structure of  RE 7. I’m not sure if I’d say I like Village more than the last entry, but I’m awfully fond of it regardless. For starters, Ethan is back. I doubt most fans care much about that either way. Ethan didn’t have much of a personality in RE 7, and he still doesn’t have much of one now. Granted, he talks more and exhibits more emotion, but he’s also a fucking idiot. That being said, the story is actually pretty good, following up on a lot of cues from the last game. Sometimes the callbacks can feel a little forced, and the way Resident Evil Village can scream about its importance to series lore can feel ham-fisted and a bit unnecessary. The plot concerns Ethan’s baby getting kidnapped by a cult run by Mother Miranda: an extremely old being that has control over a village in Europe. A village where all the inhabitants have American accents. Weird. Miranda has four underlings, and it’s up to Ethan to fight through them to get his baby back. I usually hate “my baby got kidnapped” as a trope, but I liked what Capcom did with it here.I’ve seen a lot of “it’s a lot like Resident Evil 4” going around and, yeah, sort of. The combat is like a mixture between RE 7 and RE 4. Village is an action game, but it’s a more grounded one. The insanely hectic, anxiety-inducing battles that RE 4 was built around aren’t what Resident Evil Village focuses on. They show up occasionally, but honestly, it varies from section to section. Each of Miranda’s underlings has their own separate area, and the gameplay style can vary between these.  One of them is your typical Resident Evil affair, filled with key hunting and puzzle solving. Another section plays like an indie horror game, with no combat or resource gathering at all. Yes, there’s an RE 4 section, and it’s probably the toughest part of the game.There’s a little something for everybody in Resident Evil Village. I’m happy about this, but also a little disappointed. Truthfully, I love the classic style gameplay, and I wanted more of the RE 7 formula in Village. While it is here, I didn’t get my fill. But I did enjoy myself greatly most of the time. This is undeniably a well-designed game, and there are plenty of surprises in store. You’ll often return to the titular village itself. New pathways open up, and you can find new things by returning with new items.For instance, you get a well wheel that can be used to retrieve a bucket from the bottoms of wells, which are scattered around the village. Most things like this are marked on your map, so they can be hard to miss. Treasures make a return from RE 4, both dropped by enemies and found in various forms. Some can be combined into ultra-valuable items. You’ll also find money all over the place, which is used to buy items from the game’s merchant, Duke. He buys and sells, plus he upgrades weapons. He’ll even cook for you. You’ll need to kill animals for meat to get that. Yes, there’s hunting. They don’t respawn, though, and fish are, surprisingly, the hardest to come across. Duke’s dishes permanently improve some of Ethan’s capabilities.On the normal difficulty, you don’t necessarily need to worry about these upgrades, though. Resident Evil Village is fairly easy on normal for most of the game. I think I got hit once each during the first two major boss fights. Ethan has a lot more health this time. In the last game, he could typically take just a few hits from enemies. Here, you can take a couple of hits and have your health stay green. Once it hits the RE 4-esque part, though, there is a difficulty spike. I ran out of handgun and shotgun ammo if you can believe it. The boss of this section also kicked my ass up and down the block.Resident Evil 7 threw supplies at you like the herb and chem fluid stores were going out of business. Resident Evil Village gives you enough to survive, but there’s pressure to make your shots count. Although I barely used the sniper rifle, which would have made things much less dubious. Surprisingly, there just aren’t that many herbs. The game doesn’t give you healing items much at all, but you don’t need them that often on normal and perhaps the game gives you more if you’re struggling. I liked the pressure that came with resource management here. I did kill almost everything that moved though, even if I did avoid foes every now and again.There’s a lot of fighting, yes, but not nearly as much as in RE 4. There’s a greater enemy variety than in RE 7, mind, even if almost all of the enemies are humanoid — no spiders, no dogs, no licker-esque monstrosities. The combat is great, regardless. It’s set again in first-person view, but with more of RE 4 mixed in. I didn’t even mind too much when a section towards the end of the game practically turned into a run-and-gun killfest, because it still had enough of “holding out against waves” in it to still feel like Resident Evil. The inventory system from RE 4 also makes a comeback, so you can pick up damn near everything you come across as long as you purchase storage upgrades.Resident Evil Village is about as long as its predecessor. It took me 10 hours, but there’s a fair amount of optional side stuff that I did, which wasn’t really in the last game. My actual playtime felt a good deal higher, though. I think the game just pauses the timer for all sorts of things. Once you beat the game, you unlock a points shop. The points are acquired by completing challenges, which you can set out to do on subsequent playthroughs. The Mercenaries game mode is included, and it’s pretty much what it should be.Resident Evil Village is both not exactly what I wanted but, surprisingly, better than I expected. In a lot of ways, it’s like a Resident Evil-themed amusement park, which can make it feel less cohesive and a bit silly. However, most fans of the series will like what we got here. It has a well-designed world filled with interesting things to see and do, and a lot of variety that keeps it feeling fresh for the duration. The classic Resident Evil feeling that the last game provided is missed some, but Capcom has proved that it can be trusted to keep making good games in the series. I really hope the team follows through on the promise held by this game’s ending, though.It jumps between gameplay styles more than I expected and doesn't scratch the same itch as its predecessor, but this is a damn good game that every fan of the series needs to play.About Us

Resident Evil Village,Jaz Sagoo,COGconnected,https://cogconnected.com/review/resident-evil-village-review/,"In 2017, Capcom dug up the rotting, disease-ridden carcass of Resident Evil and breathed new life into the franchise with the blood-curdling Resident Evil 7: Biohazard. Stripping away the amalgamation of genres that plagued RE6, the developers placed horror at the forefront, focusing on claustrophobic environments to tell a haunting story that resonated with fans of the genre. After several critically acclaimed remakes, the masters of horror have returned with a new entry in the franchise, but will this trip to a quaint yet disturbing village reach the heights of the Baker ranch?Set three years after RE7, we follow a mentally scarred Ethan who is trying to start a new life in rural eastern Europe with his wife, Mia and newborn daughter, Rose. Almost instantly, things escalate and you awaken in a squalid village that has been ravaged by some ungodly creatures.The titular village is a hub that alters and changes throughout. Paths branch and descend into absurd areas that linger with uncertainty. Each of the four imposing heads of the local great houses, who are the disciples of the mysterious religious leader, Mother Miranda, have distinct locations that offer insight into their psyche.The characters ooze personality but none as much as the alluring Lady Dimitrescu. Deliciously brought to life by the charismatic Maggie Robertson, her striking design and foreboding manner emits a sense of anxiety whilst investigating the aristocratic castle. Similar to Mr. X, she stalks the environment, haunting your every move creating incredible moments of panic-stricken fear. Positioned throughout rooms are diary entries that develop the backstory of the family. Although these are only snippets of information, they help to paint a picture of the horrors that have manifested within the blood-soaked walls of the castle.Other occupants of the unsavory village link to specific sub-genres of horror. We have the repulsive Salvatore Moreau, which focuses on gore and the macabre whereas Donno Beneviento and her unnerving puppet bride delves deep into psychological fears. Each of the crazed cast of characters adds to the psychotic world of the series but unfortunately, they don’t get time to breathe, leaving the gamer wanting to learn more about each antagonist.Celebrating the rich lineage of the series, Resident Evil Village combines elements of previous titles to create a sumptuous experience. Not only does the setting echo the guttural screams of RE4, but the focus on gunplay and action has returned. Developing on its predecessor, weapon-based attacks have had an overhaul and feel much better in this iteration. Prowling the environment, are the dreaded Lycans, although they lurch at a meandering pace, the thrill of lining up a headshot is still present and adds tension to each encounter.Even though combat has a larger presence in the game, Capcom has perfectly balanced this with puzzles that are surrounded by a sinister ambiance. Compared to previous titles, the puzzles are relatively simple with little exploration required to gather key items, however, the constant threat of creatures lying in wait, ready to maul and devour you, makes each moment a thrill. Scripted sequences oppose the methodical pace adding urgency to the game. Unfortunately, the strict circumstances that are sometimes required to complete these segments hinder the cinematic sequence. Having to restart sections due to not standing in a particular area takes away from the exhilaration of the chase, and ends up becoming a tedious task. Fear of the unknown permeates throughout and is amplified by every creak that reverberates through the dense environment. The 3D audio heightens spatial awareness, helping to locate the source of unidentifiable sounds. Adding to the incredible, sound design is the perfectly placed use of silence. Although some areas are alive with footsteps and the raspy breath of adversaries, these are beautifully countered with the eerie uncertainty of deathly quiet.Exploring the disfigured and damaged environment gives insight into the tyranny that the settlement has succumbed to. Each location has an impending sense of doom and dread which is signaled by the remnants of life littered throughout. Minor details such as decaying fruit and pools of blood help to build a putrid aura that festers within the atmosphere. The visual feast is intensified by the luscious lighting that streaks across locations. Breathing shadows make each step a nerve-shredding amble through a frightening folk-lore inspired world.Aiding you in your quest is The Duke, an obese merchant that provides upgrades and ammunition. Due to a limited inventory and resources being scarce, he becomes an integral part of your adventure. Collected items can be sold to him and in return, you can bolster your arsenal for the many encounters that lay ahead. New to the franchise is the hunting system. You are able to collect various meats and deliver them to Duke’s Kitchen. Here, you can select from a menu of dishes that grant permanent upgrades. Although this adds another layer to the game, it feels a little out of place.After the 10 to 15 hour campaign, you can unlock the Mercenaries mode. In this, you are tasked with slaughtering hordes of enemies to gain a high score. Although not for everyone, it does add longevity to the title and is the perfect stop-gap whilst waiting for Re:Verse. Packaged with Village and due to be released in the summer, Re:Verse is a four to six-person deathmatch which features iconic characters from the series and extreme bioweapons that can turn the tide in an instant. Whilst other online ventures in the franchise have been well below par, this does look promising. Celebrating its 25th anniversary, Resident Evil Village is a fitting tribute to the history of the franchise. Although some of the enigmatic characters are not given the screentime they deserve, they are incredibly realized through the environments that evoke the personality of its inhabitant. Perhaps the game could have taken more risks in this outing, however, this dastardly showcase of the macabre is intoxicating.*** A PlayStation 5 key provided by the publisher ***Developer: CapcomPublisher: Capcom"
Resident Evil Village,Liam Croft,Push Square,http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/resident_evil_village,"GuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpResident Evil Village2021 8.7Game RatingUser Ratings: 381Our Review: Scroll DownGoth punkVersion Reviewed: EuropeanIf we're being brutally honest, Resident Evil Village puts Resident Evil 7: Biohazard to shame. That's not to say we've soured on Ethan Winters in the four years since his introduction, but rather what Capcom has done next goes way above and beyond the events of the Baker incident. Resident Evil Village is incredible. By borrowing the best bits from its predecessor and combining them with DNA strands from a certain Spanish settlement, we finally have a proper rival to the great Resident Evil 4.It's no coincidence either that the first mainline entry to be directly inspired by the 2005 classic can consider itself up there with the very best — such is the everlasting quality of Las Plagas. The gothic horror setting is back, inventory management emulates Tetris once more, a Merchant takes cash for supplies and weaponry, and there are no undead hordes to be seen for miles. With the first-person perspective and general combat mechanics of Resident Evil 7: Biohazard retained, this really is the best of both worlds.Protagonist Ethan Winters could probably even consider himself to be in the very same position. Three years after Chris Redfield rescued him and wife Mia from the clutches of Eveline, the twosome are living happily with a daughter named Rose in Europe. That is until the boulder-punching star breaks into their house one night and murders Mia, kidnapping baby Rose in the process. The next time Winters wakes up, he finds himself in a remote village packed full of werewolves and other monstrosities.Ethan uses this as a chance to search for answers — so do we since Capcom still refuses to properly reveal the man’s face — and it's here where he bumps into the stars of the show. The dwelling is owned and operated by five important figures, all of which you'll meet and interact with over the course of the 12-hour campaign. They each have a section of a village to call their own, which leads to a series of vastly different environments despite the usual trappings of the snowy setting. And yes, one of those high-ranking members is indeed the woman of the moment Lady Dimitrescu.The 2.9 metres tall monster of a female stalks many of your moves in Castle Dimitrescu — the location that houses the perfect blend of classic Resident Evil gameplay. Combat feels weighty with weapons that take their time to reload and blast enemies to smithereens while puzzles remain interesting and engaging throughout. There are keys to discover, intricate brain teasers to solve, and upgrades to be bought from the Duke. It's all so, so much more satisfying than any other recent instalments have had to offer.You just have to keep an eye out for Lady Dimitrescu at every turn. She'll follow you about and make her presence known in the same way Mr X did in Resident Evil 2, attacking you when she gets chance and keeping you on edge whenever some downtime has to be taken in order to solve a puzzle. Some corners of the internet will be disappointed that she doesn't actually feature as much in the game as pre-release marketing has led us to believe, but when Lady Dimitrescu is on the prowl, the castle owner is a force to be reckoned with. At least her transformation is something to behold. Let your imagination run wild, and then Lady Dimitrescu goes one step further.However, dare we say that despite her sass and villainy, she's actually the least interesting member of the group? We really do think Capcom has buried the lede here (potentially on purpose) because what Heisenberg, Donna Beneviento, Salvatore Moreau, and overall leader Mother Miranda bring to the table is nothing short of staggering. As previously mentioned, they have all taken a piece of the village for themselves, allowing each one to shape those areas however they see fit. Heisenberg has used the opportunity to construct a huge factory churning out his own set of physical horrors and Salvatore Moreau takes charge of the lake, swamp, and what lurks beneath.But then there’s Donna Beneviento. We're sworn to secrecy and won't be able to reveal what that creepy doll and its owner have been up to, but then we wouldn't want to spoil the sequence anyway. Seriously, that's a very, very special one-hour stretch. You'll be discussing it with your friends long after the credits roll.It's the highlight of what Capcom is going for with Resident Evil Village, but there are so many more moments that will stick with fans for a long time. The prolific Japanese developer goes places with this one. Boss fights that wouldn’t look out of place in The Evil Within, surprises and stretches of gameplay you wouldn't expect from the series, and awesome callbacks to previous titles. It even avoids the franchise's usual trope of a poor final act. The game has it all — the less we say the better if anything. Resident Evil Village is something you need to experience for yourself.What brings it back to some basis of reality is the village itself, located in the centre of the four extremes the leaders have put together for themselves. The way it opens up as you progress is satisfying while scribbled notes that litter the ramshackle houses create immediate empathy for those killed by the Lycans that have taken over. You really get the sense this is a place on the edge — those still left are just barely clinging on. But despite that hostility, it's the only place you could even begin to call home from start to finish. Small-scale puzzles bolster your inventory and livestock can be slaughtered to turn into permanent upgrades whenever you encounter the Duke — it's worth investing time into the location, especially as it grows in both size and emotional weight the more you progress.There's just a sense of constant dread fuelling the game, accentuated by a haunting soundtrack and a purposefully uneasy atmosphere. It's something that gets under your skin to create fear and tension as you explore each room and stumble upon new areas. Jump scares are very rarely utilised, allowing the fearful ambience of the village to consume you.Perhaps our only real criticism then is that enemy variety isn't quite up to par. The Lycan horde is bolstered by variations on their own species as well as more adventurous foes in the late game, but some locations don't have quite enough to call their own in order to always keep you guessing what's around the next corner. There's much more variation than what the Molded had to offer in Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, but you'll have to rely on boss fights for some truly unique encounters.No matter what monstrosity you're up against though, you can rest assured the entire fight will look good. Demon's Souls now has a competitor for the best looking game on PlayStation 5 — what Capcom has achieved so early in the generation is very impressive. Don't worry about Resident Evil Village being a cross-gen game because with HDR and Ray-Tracing enabled, character models come to life and lighting illuminates rooms and hallways like never before. You really notice the difference when it's not there. The trade-off here is a frame rate hovering somewhere between 45 and 60. It's an odd window to target, especially for console gaming, and we'll admit it takes a second or two to get used to. It gradually becomes second nature the more you play, but with minor frame rate drops when the action gets intense, it's not always smooth sailing.The other option is the rock-solid 60 frames-per-second mode, although you'll lose all the benefits of Ray-Tracing. And they, simply put, are a game-changer on PS5. Resident Evil Village is far and away the best example of how much an impact the feature can have on a lit environment. Sticking with the default option is our strong recommendation.The PS5 SSD also justifies itself with load times that come and go inside three seconds. Select your save and you won't encounter a single load screen outside of the immediate one to get you back in the action. Throw in excellent use of the PS5 DualSense controller's Adaptive Triggers and Capcom has put in work to make sure Sony's latest console is firing on all cylinders. Much like Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, each weapon comes with different tensions on the triggers. It's much harder to accurately fire a sniper rifle than a handgun, for example. Long may this sort of fantastic implementation continue.Rounding out the package is the return of The Mercenaries mode, a round-based undertaking where you fight for high scores by taking down enemies and racking up combos. It's a fun and meaty addition split across multiple stages that are sure to lengthen your overall playtime. The mode won't change anyone's mind if they're not into this sort of stuff, but fans will welcome its homecoming with open arms.While the Resident Evil series has been on a high for a number of years now, Resident Evil Village sets an entirely new standard. Its cast of villains is up there with the very best, memorable sequences and gameplay sections beg to be played over and over again, and a sense of constant dread created by the atmosphere and soundtrack keeps you on the edge of your seat. Even the combat is solid this time around and the lengths Capcom has gone to take advantage of the PS5 pays off with impressive Ray-Tracing. Does it better Resident Evil 4? Maybe not, but it's damn close. Real damn close. Resident Evil Village is an essential playthrough for anyone with even a passing interest in the franchise.Excellent 9/10Scoring PolicyReview copy provided by CapcomPlease note that some external links on this page are affiliate links, which means if you click them and make a purchase we may receive a small percentage of the sale.

I absolutely love Resident Evil Village, so if you have any questions, feel free to copy me in.Wow that first sentence got me interested.I can't read all for now but I've preordered the game, I've lost myself to the hype.So anyway, my question: If I'm a p***y and I barely can end Resi 7, will I be super scared with this one? lol12 hours? Is that the expected average length or just how long it took you? Did you rush through the game or take your time? Also, do you know how it plays on PS4?I'm definitely going to play this game at some point but no clue when. Sounds like a lot of fun.Help! This amount of hype is unhealthy for me.Nice review! The wait for a PS5 gets ever more painful. Congrats to Capcom for keeping this series’ rancid heart beating.Isn't the idiom ""IN 16 years""?, not ""for 16 years?"". The latter means it will be the best game for the next 16 years. Is the idiom different in the UK than North America?Just placed a preorder! Glad you guys like it som much. Other reviews are quite mixed so far. Many complaints about the boss battles being anti climatic and some complaints about it not being scary enough. But I’m hypedThe last RE game I played was RE5 and that wasn't that good really  Then I played the RE6 demo and that WAS DREADFUL :-/ I use to love RE games in the PS1/2 days. Might try this one day tho(but i am to scared to anyway) Can’t wait . Great time to be a gamerGreat to hear the positive reviews around this but:“ If we're being brutally honest, Resident Evil Village puts Resident Evil 7: Biohazard to shame. “Hmm, I don’t know if you played it in VR, but I do not see how it’s possible for 8 to elicit the same dread, fear, terror, as 7 in VR.I love horror games but am also a massive wimp, so this should be an interesting one lmaoGreat review Liam!@LiamCroft YES LIAM!!!! I'll be honest i haven't read the review (yet - i will, promise), but i'm so excited. My copy just shipped, so i hope so much it gets to me by Friday. Can. Not. Wait. Feels like that time i rushed to the store to buy a playstation 1 on Resi 2 launch day all over again. Can't help but get psyched for this series.So happy its good. 😁Edit: just read the review. Great work, it sounds brilliant. Im concerned by the mention of a creepy doll though. Most terrifying thing there is in the horror genre!@Col_McCafferty I completed a comprehensive playthrough, including side content, in 12 hours. I took my time with it. My second playthrough was then roughly seven to eight hours.@thefourfoldroot That sentence is referring to more than just horror elements.No matter how good people say RE7 and 8 are, I still can't bring myself to play a FPS Resident Evil. Just feels wrong to me.@liamCroft Does the game make use of haptic feedback?Can't wait to dive into this at the weekend!I'm at the edge of my seat. I am very excited to lose sleep this weekend from terror and intrigue.Interesting that RT is considered a game-changer here as Digital Foundry says the exact opposite. Just something to consider especially since with RT off it's supposedly a steady 60fps.Man I really need to finish returnal quickly and play this 😃@thefourfoldroot Agree that VR made 7 the scariest game I've ever played and I doubt 8 would get close without being in VR.Read the PureXbox review first and felt deflated due to their disappointment , while reading PushSquare review afterwards has left me back to excited again! Good job @LiamCroft Do you know where my car keys are ?@liamCroft how's the audio; good use of 3D Audio?worth playing with headphones on?@Rob_230 Great to hear you'll be playing, Rob! I recommend getting started as soon as possible, there's some stuff you'll really want to see for yourself instead of getting spoiled.@YETi Unfortunately not. It's just the Adaptive Triggers.@LiamCroft If it doesn't spoil too much, is their any choice involved with your Mercenaries avatar?@Carl-G I highly recommend the Revelations games as well, if you want another means to dip your toes in. It takes the action from 5 but environments are more narrow (more akin to the older games).@StonyKL Village VR would have been a day 1 purchase so I'm going to wait. Hopefully one day we will see a Resident Evil Village VR when PSVR2 is released.Is it as good as RE7 ?To be honest I'm a bit disappointed in this review. You covered all the boring stuff like the game and that, but all anyone really cares about is whether or not the merchant sounds piratey and says stuff like, ""What're ya buyin'?""@LiamCroft Is it still survival horror, or is it an action movie like RE4?Wow bring on Friday, this was the big game I was looking forward to this year and it sounds like it won't disappoint and clever of Capcom to hide even more interesting villains behind a certain tall lady@LiamCroft I didn’t say it did. But as a horror game (in the first half anyway, and by tradition) that is one of the main things on which I rate a Resi game. That and survival elements.@hypnotoad You left them in the fruit bowl.@Ash_uk1 I used the PS5 3D Pulse Headset for large stretches of the game and I can't say I really noticed much 3D Audio use.@Broosh I haven't played enough of The Mercenaries mode to confidently say either way. Sorry!Hmm…debating on whether I want the Dual Sense support or VRR on Series X. That 45 to 60 FPS makes me wonder if VRR would be a more solid option.@LiamCroft We ain't got a fruit bowl.We're not posh like Geordies.A 9 is really impressive. Personally, I was disappointed with the demo so I'll wait for a hefty discount on this one.@LiamCroft Is there a lot of gore? As with suspense/horror films, I prefer atmosphere and tension to blood and guts.@awp69 Well it got a 7 from PureXbox and a 9 from PushSquare so I'd go with PS5 I'll be choosing based on the controller I prefer seeing as though the performance is pretty much the same between the two by the sounds of things (or not noticeable unless you are a robot) so I'd recommend either that - or whichever you can get cheaper I guess!@-Juice- It has a good balance between classic survival horror and action. I think any Resident Evil fan will be satisfied by this game.@hobbes242 The gore is about on par with other Resident Evil games. I can't really think of any scene that really stood out to me because of its gore alone.@StonyKL That rating is interesting because it seems like it’s most definitely an outlier in scores. Doesn’t seem to have anything to do with the Xbox build. What’s up with your sister site hating on this game? LolSounds like a top game but why not max the res at 1440p or similar to stop the frame rate drops. It makes sense no sense at all, hopefully they'll patch it.Fantastic review 👍Can’t wait, so many good games in a row.Oh hell yes. Let's gooooooooooo!Pre-ordering when pre download opens. Im looking forward to playing this in the dark with my headset on.@LiamCroft Hi Liam, thanks for the review. Do you know if you can transfer the save from PS4 to 5? Ie can I start on PS4 then move over to the PS5 version if I actually manage to snag a console? Or would I have to keep playing the PS4 version via back compat?How long is the game? Thought 7 was way to short even if it was great, I still want my games long@LiamCroft how many hours did you completed it ?@Subsided some people got it early. completed it in 13-14 hours depend on difficulty they chooseOh look let's compare every single re game that comes out to trashy re4. How about let's not do that and just judge the game for its own standards.Really can't wait for this one, the enviroments and atmosphere look incredible. Gave the demo a miss so everything will be fresh going into it. Would have loved to have played this on a cold Decembers night for the first playthrough to add to the atmosphere but there's no way I am waiting that long. An excuse for a 2nd playthrough perhaps.@MichaelHawj that sounds pretty decent@LiamCroft is Lady D as irritating as Mr X. I thought Mr X was a little too relentless in the RE2 remake which got annoying after a while.Also can you change difficulty mid game if neededI’m not one to get stuck on numbers, i just wonder why it wasn’t a 10, considering the review sure sounds like it.The only to cons are, arguably, minor issues.Resident evil village does looks amazing.its nice that the dualsence controller has been put through good use.like everyone expected.its a excellent game.word up sonAh you can't praise a game that much and not give it a 10/10. The negative don't seem enough to bring down a point.""Jump scares are very rarely utilised, allowing the fearful ambience of the village to consume you.""Yes. Capcom utilized what made Silent Hill's horror so effective; allowing the set pieces, music, ambience to just gnaw at the back of your mind, always keeping you on edge and uncomfortable.Shame about Lady Dimitrescu not being so prominent. And no, I don't mean the crazy thirst but simply having a powerful and iconic female villain in the game.@Carl-G Play 7, it will cost less and you'll be able to see if you like the new style. It is brilliant though (I am also a big scaredy cat and I managed to get through it).Great review. 12 hrs sounds woefully short though, but being a whimp I'll probably only manage 30min bursts at a time so will no doubt seem longer.Hats off to capcom, sounds like they've really worked hard getting this optimised across different formats and still taking time to add elements just for ps5.@greenwichlee I'm afraid I don't know the answer to this. I was having trouble downloading the PS4 version of the game, so I would have tried to get an answer for you. This should be answered once the game is out though.@Rob_230 I didn't have much trouble avoiding Lady Dimitrescu, I'd say she's probably easier than Mr X. I don't believe you can change the difficulty mid-game.I still need to finish 7. It didn't seem to hook me like previous games did. I'll get this eventually.I already have Biomutant and Mass Effect on pre-order for this month, but this is very very tempting as well. 🙈Capcom have really turned this franchise around over recent years! I'm glad this game is reviewing well as it looks like it is at a high standard. Definitely will be playing this soon!Nice review article as well.Astrobot showed what can be done with haptic feedback and a shame that developers aren't really taking advantage of it for Ps5 releases:( I feared this would happen.I'd like to get through Resi 7 before jumping into this one but it's nice to hear it's great. Not the biggest fan of FPS Resi but I'll give it a shot.@LiamCroft This looks amazing. I also watched the IGN review who seemed to say exactly the opposite of everything you said. I've got it on preorder and i know i will love it. I've also noticed my preorder timer says 19 hours, which is tomorrow, that can't be right?I don't get why RE4 is held in such high regard. I had it at launch on Gamecube and even there I got tired before the end with all the shooting.
I feel both remakes supassed RE4 for me, I'd certainly rather play them again at this point.The combat in the Villiage demo didn't feel good to me either, I felt the enemies were just absorbing the shots. I think I'll watch some more gameplay before I decide on this one initially, though as a series fan since the PS1 / Saturn, will want to play it at some point.I’m concerned about this as I never considered 4 a horror game, 7 felt like the best resi since 2 and 4 was a bad turn towards action. So these comparisons bother me.Sold. Picking this up Friday@1_W1NG3D_4NG3L There are two Trophies tied to The Mercenaries, one of which requires you to get an S rank on all stages. Getting the Platinum Trophy in this one is going to be quite hard.Can’t wait for this game. There’s a few varied reviews out there but all mostly positive. Can’t wait to play this and see how good the ray tracing is on Friday! I hope it’s actually scary and tense, resi 7 was tense for a couple of hours then I didn’t find it scary really after jackI received my bulk order of adult nappies today. Disappointed to here that this will be less scary than 7.@thefourfoldroot Agreed, RE7 in VR had me screaming like Scooby Doo and Shaggy,Can you jump straight in without playing Resident Evil 7?Surprisingly, I think this may be the very first time I ever cancel a pre order.
With the more objective reviews that actual take into account (in their verdict), the problems with the game design from a series perspective; I just don't see paying full price for an 7-12 hour game with these issues. I'll play it when the price matches the content.@shonenjump86 No, the story of Resident Evil 7 is very, very important to Resident Evil Village.@deathaxe not a bad idea. Ty!So it's good then?Yay. Love the series so would've probably picked it up regardless but now super hyped.This may be the reason I decide to track down a PS5.Thanks for the review@Lightning_FF13 Same here.Got both on order from Base.Just shy of £96 for a PS5 and PS4 game.Not too bad a price methinks.Paying £55+ per is not for me.Even Amazon seem to be selling at 'full' price.🤦I'm preloaded and ready to go... can't wait!!@Ristar24 I've always felt that resident evil 4 was the downfall of the series. The RE2 remake did a good job balancing the action with the survival horror.@Goodguyjusty Yep, I agree. By the time in RE4 I was fighting a monster with a mini gun with waves of enemies (towards the end), it just didn't feel like Resident Evil anymore to me. I like the RE3 remake too, as although had more action than 2, it still encouraged you to dodge and save ammo.@LiamCroft great review, super stoked for this!! Have they done anything to fix the baffling implementation of motion aiming that was in the demo?@Throb my online receipt says tomorrow as well...@LiamCroft Do You Get An Explanation For What Chris Is Doing There? Nod Once For No And Twice For Yes.@LiamCroft ah, I’m gonna have to get on 7 then. Thanks.@Areus Nods twiceResident Evil 4 is still my favourite however after reading this that could all change. Bit disappointed with the length though but like the saying goes quality over quantity and I never judge a book but its cover either.I've tried the demo on PC and the atmosphere reminds me of Resi 4. The estimated gameplay time is around 10 hours but it could take more than than for completion. The enemies are more combative and it's better to run than take them head on. it's easier to avoid the enemies because they won't follow you in certain areas. The main selling point for me is the setting and Halloween folklore in the game. I will probably buy this on Steam post-launch after it's patch for bugs or errors.This was a great read! I'm reading more and more that this isn't as scary as 7 which in some way is better for me but at the same time it leaves me with a bit of sadness lolI love and hate being scared in movies and games...I'm excited to play it My copy is coming ... I have the feel that this game will be defining for the series in the future!First Person again? I’ll passSo I'm assuming Capcom didn't add gyro aiming to the PS4/PS5 versions? Such a shame if not.Anyway I pre ordered the deluxe edition for PS5 which shipped out today, so it should be here by Friday.I've been play Resident Evil 7 all week in preparation for RE 8. Working on beating Madhouse difficulty which is fun but definitely challenging. Friday can't come soon enough.🥵 take: Village doesn’t have a hope at coming close to the RE1-2 Remakes. RE4 was never all that. But I still got Village preordered and am looking forward to it. Glad to see it get such a good review.Haven't played a FPS in awhile this going to be my first play of RE in series but watched family member complete all RE games as a kid @LiamCroft whats the save system. Is there auto save check points? Or you have to find the typewriters.@brendon987 Both. It regularly auto-saves and there are typewriters for manual saves.Excellent review, @LiamCroft! A couple questions for you:1. Do we have enough bullets to face all the enemies or do we have to rely on the knife?
2. Is the story better tied to the series than RE7?@RenanKJ 1. I only ever used the knife to open boxes. Never needed it to actually kill enemies.2. There are more callbacks to previous games than Resident Evil 7, but the story of Village is heavily, heavily linked to 7.Just pre-ordered it. Base.com are selling it for £47 with DLC.@AFCC apparently they dialed down this one. Not happy about that.@djape yeah I read so too but since I'm an anxiety full wreck, this might actually be the horror game I finish lol“She'll follow you about and make her presence known in the same way Mr X did in Resident Evil 2.”Reading this just sent my excitement levels spiralling downward into oblivion.Why??? I suppose we can expect this annoying feature in every RE game going forward 🙄Well, at least you seemed to have picked a reviewer that likes these type of games as opposed to IGN 's draw a name out of a hat method.I love that RE constantly reinvents itself and most of the time succeeds. Risks are a good thing.It would suck if they just took the COD route and made the same game 100 times.@AFCC yeah for sure you will finish it... I'm getting this game in about 10hrs Pre order cancelled. Definitely going to play this, but it being that short, and considering my backlog right now, I wouldn't even get to playing this game in a timeframe that would justify full price for it at that size. Game looks great though.@fR_eeBritney“She'll follow you about and make her presence known in the same way Mr X did in Resident Evil 2.”""I suppose we can expect this annoying feature in every RE game going forward""Eh? It's been in Resident Evil games since the beginning.Mr X in RE2.
Nemesis in RE3.
Tyrant/T-078 in RE: Code Veronica X.
Mendez in RE4.
Jack in RE7
Lady Dimitrescu in RE8So this is not a new ""annoying feature"" as you can see, and if they are utilising this ""in every RE game going forward"" they'd only be following the established template@NeonPizza completely agree. I have replayed Remake, 4, 5, 6 (ew) in the last 6 months to varying degrees of success even though I pumped hundreds of hours into those games in their heyday (except 6). They are more often than not very clunky and dated.
Reintroduction of something as archaic as fixed camera angles only panders to people who can’t adapt or look to the future.
In 2021 I want the creature comforts of modern games with modern, sensible quality of life additions.Purists are very boring people in my experience. Whether it be music, film or video games. There are people in this thread who are so narrow minded they won’t even consider playing an RE game in first person. I hope I never become like that.@LiamCroft - ""Resident Evil Village (PS5) - Capcom's Best Horror Game for 16 Years""""...we finally have a proper rival to the great Resident Evil 4.""Is this including or excluding Resi 2 Remake?Also, how indicative would you say the two demoes (Village and Castle) are of the overall game experience?@Arnna sometimes it's not necessarily about being narrow minded, but rather not enjoying something. I've tried a ton of first person games over the decades and I've enjoyed zero so far (excluding VR games).@FullMetalWesker Yes, that includes the Resident Evil 2 remake. And the two demos are pretty indicative of the final game.puts Resi 7 to shame? that's a big statement as I thought that game was damn near perfect. Interesting.@Profondo I’ll give you Nemesis in the original RE3 (that’s why I never really loved that game) but Mr X in the original RE2 was only in the B playthrough (which I never played). Tyrant in CVX and Mendez in RE4 were just extended boss fights weren’t they? They didn’t stalk you relentlessly for huge portions of the game did they? I can’t really remember?@OM1993 Lol, thanks but I'm good! Really not a fan of first person perspective.My copy just arrived in the post.Thinking about taking an early lunch and firing it up...@Shepherd_Tallon enjoy if you do!RE7 had its moments but I honestly preferred the remakes. I'll most likely pick Village up in a future sale.@jdv95 Thanks!Alas, my boss called. I'll be giving it a go now though.How gory is it? I started playing biohazard and got to a certain scene and couldn’t take it any more. Is it as gory? Specifically what makes my stomach turn is torture gore. Any of that? I like a good horror game like dead space and such - but sitting and watching people cut off limbs and eat them… nope.Was already hyped but even more so after reading this review. RE VII: biohazard is one of my top 5 favorite games last-gen and one of my top 3 in the series. My copy should be here Friday, can't wait to see for myself if it lives up to expectations.@Shepherd_Tallon mine has arrived too. As soon as kids are in bed i'll be firing it up. Wonder if i can push bedtime to 3pm 😂@LiamCroft Big question has to be whether there will be an accompanying candle this time around to complete the experience:http://www.numskull.com/products/resident-evil-vii-4d-candle/https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2017/01/resident_evil_7s_wicked_candle_will_let_you_smell_the_game@Rob_230 Oh nice nice! 😂 I was thinking about pulling a late one tonight, but I might finish up work early tomorrow and sink in to the couch for the weekend...Actually feck it. I'll do both. 😎Hopefully they will patch in a third person perspective. I don’t play first person games often as a prefer the older style. Game looks good but will never play in its current state.@Culjoseth putting in third person would not be a patch they would have to completely redesign major portions of the game that will not happen@LiamCroft Thanks for the review, 2 questions:
1. what upgrades do you get from the duke? I image he has weapon upgrades and upgrades for backpack size (like RE4), anything else?
2. are there (mini?) boss fights apart from the big 4+1 ?@Tencho2010 1. You can upgrade all of your weapons' stats and buy inventory expansions from the Duke as well as attachments that make your guns better.2. There is one more mainline boss fight beside the main five, and then one other optional one.@LiamCroft My goodness this game is incredible. I have just reached the castle and what a ride its been so far. Your score so far is fully justified and then some.@Rob_230 Glad to hear you’re loving it! And you’ve seen nothing yet 😉@Logonogo Depends on how the game was made. They could have it already in there for a change later down the road. It is doubtful since RE7 never flipped to the better perspective. But here’s hoping!Uff.. given RE4 is the one i liked the least until RE7 and the lack of third person option, i think this one isn't for me. I'll be waiting for a remake of Code Veronica.@NeonPizza Yeah i think its coming. From what i've played so far there are some very fast paced sections that would be very difficult to run on the original PSVR headset without severe performance issues. Newer hardware should make it possible though. I've been playing with an eye on VR and some scenes look like they have been made with VR in mind. I'd be amazed if support isnt patched in next year.Not sure i would play it though. RE7 freaked me out in VR and i had to give up around the time you fight the early boss woth the chainsaw 😂 and i dont see this game being any different@Col_McCafferty I actually am beginning to like games in smaller hour doses, these 160 hour games just are becoming too much. One literally has to have no life, no job, no responsibilities in order to fully play these AAA games now a days.. 12 hours is just fine by me...@MakersMark Sure I get that but it's not as if all AAA games take over a hundred hours to finish. Something closer to 20 hours or so would be fine for a Resi game but nowhere near long enough for say Horizon Forbidden West.It took me around 15 hours or so to complete my first run in Resi 2 and a couple of hours less in the second run. Still, that's close to 30 hours of entertainment. I'll still end up playing this game but £55 for a game you can finish within a few day to a week seems a bit of a rip-off to me.I am 40 mins into the game on PS4 Pro and it looks gorgeous!The console gets a little loud but this is a mid gen game after all!Seeing as I doubt I'll be getting a PS5 any time soon, is the PS4 version worth picking up? Is it a noticeable downgrade from the PS5 version? I don't care about a 60fps framerate or Ray Tracing, I just want to be able to play the game without feeling like it's being powered by a hamster in a wheel.Sounds great but i always will be a 3rd person Resident Evil fan. Not that im not going to play it but 3rd person is the way to go for me i played the series from the first one and 6 is the only one i dis not want to finish.@NeonPizza I could see why you’d say that RE1 Remake hasn’t aged well because of the fixed camera angle and controls mainly. But even considering that, I don’t see how Village is even in the same class.RE2 Remake, while it does have minor flaws, is one of the greatest survival horror games that Capcom likely won’t top anytime soon, certainly not with Village.Granted I’ve only finished the Village demos, not the full game. My copy arrives today so I’ll see if Village blindsides me as the best RE of the past 16 years. So far it’s greatly lacking in the scares department.currently on offer at tesco with clubcard for £40 @AFCC This one isn't scary at all, its pretty good but I think 7 is superior!!@NeonPizza don't worry, in about 3 weeks the game will have burned through every YT, TWITCH and other streamer's channel.. Everyone will know all of the secrets, and all of the spoilers and hundreds of people will have paid someone to watch them play a game, full run, without ever touching the game themselves.. This is what gaming has evolved into... yeah, I go into my games, green, blind and ignorant of everything.. The experience is MINES and only mines.. I call whats going on now ""GAMER PORN"", people getting off on watching others doing what they love to do......@NeonPizza I hear you, I’m steering clear of YT for now too ever since I saw a spoiler thumbnail. I’m about 2 hours into Village on PS5, in my opinion I agree that it’s worth waiting until you get a PS5.We definitely have differing preferences but I hope you have as much enjoyment with RE3make as I had. Knowing how it’s shorter with cut content, et cetera, what’s there is great. Not flawless but overall a really good time and I appreciate that it was made at all. It’s probably in my top 5 for RE.You have a point that REmake HD remaster’s 3D assets don’t blend with the pre-rendered images like they did on GameCube. On GC it blended so well and the lighting was more fitting. I couldn’t get into new controls, too disorienting. I think my occasional replays of Silent Hill 2 keep my tank control muscle memory intact so the clunk doesn’t bother me, it just seems fitting. Funny enough it’s RE4’s special style of tank + aiming that’s always gotten me crossed me up. I could never get very far in 4.RE0’s HD remaster is a stunner by comparison. Zero has such a strong opening IMO, I wish it didn’t fall off the rails with story and the zapping system but that’s just part of Capcom’s “live and learn”. If Capcom were to ever completely redo 0 (different story + RE2make treatment) they could have something special on their hands by telling the story of the Bravo team.@BloodEagle it has some scary moments but it has got too much action@Boxmonkey More of a lord of the Rings vide than horror, still a good game though.@davesmith01 Its really enjoyable.@Saucymonk That's a shame, were you able to get a refund?Jokes aside, I hope you do enjoy the game if you decide to play it.@bloodeagle I made a deal with myself that I won’t buy it until I finally finish Resident Evil 7, so started that again this morning!@KidBoruto I'll be playing it at some point but at the moment I'm caught up in subnautica and rocket league.@zupertramp - yep. And I’ll go with a steady 60fps every single time. Otherwise ain’t even an option in 2021. It’s a basic minimum standard@davesmith01 - me too! Started it last night! My Apple Watch has now taken on a new, eerie significance…@LiamCroft Hi Liam. I own both a PS5 and Series X. I was all set to purchase Village on the PS5, after playing all the demos, when I noticed something was off with the dualsense when using the shotgun. I was getting a very tight tension on the L2 adaptive trigger and nothing much on the R2 trigger that would feel like a solid blast. I then loaded up both versions of the demo. Series X and PS5 to do some comparisons. The Xbox RT fire button felt the same as the PS5, but the LT obviously wasn't tight. I also compared graphics, frame rate and 3D audio and it was identical. Now I'm leaning towards the Series x version. This game is definitely more action based and unless the haptics are really amazing and the triggers are better with other weapons, I'm probably going to go Series X. I also always buy physical so this will be nice to be able to still play Returnal on the PS5 to alternate games. I would like your thoughts. Besides faster loading, will I be missing out on anything going with Series X? Thanks!@everygrainofsand I know exactly what you mean. The sense of relief that finding a safe room after being on edge the whole time waiting for something horrific to happen is something else. Really pleased I’ve given this another go.

Resident Evil Village,Nathan Birch,Wccftech,https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-village-horror-greatest-hits/,"Resident Evil 7 was a major gamble, introducing a bold new setting, mechanics, and concepts to Capcom’s then-flagging horror franchise, and thankfully, the big bet paid off. Since then, Capcom has largely been coasting on the momentum RE7 provided them with a series of well-made but not-terribly-risky remakes. Well, the time for playing it safe is officially over, as Capcom delivers its true follow-up to RE7 this week! Prepare yourself for Resident Evil Village.Resident Evil Village returns to first-person perspective and the story of Ethan Winters while pushing the series’ presentation to a new level and introducing a varied new gothic-tinged world to explore. RE Village certainly doesn’t lack ambition, but following up on a horror classic is never easy. Is this the next great Resident Evil game, or has the series got itself stuck in the woods yet again? As always, grab yourself some green herbs and get ready to delve in…Resident Evil Village picks up with Ethan and Mia Winters now living a life of relative domestic bliss in Europe with their new baby daughter Rose. Ethan is having trouble forgetting the horrors of the Baker compound, but otherwise, everything seems to be going well – until Chris Redfield shows up, pops a half-dozen caps in Mia over the Winters’ dinner table, and kidnaps Ethan and Rose. Unfortunately (Or fortunately?) Chris’s mysterious scheme goes awry somehow and Ethan awakens alone on the outskirts of a very messed up village overrun by werewolves, vampires, sea monsters, creepy dolls, and other assorted horrors. Ethan doesn’t know what’s going on, but he does know he’s going to get his daughter back.Resident Evil Village kicks things off in style, with the game’s intro delivering plenty of mystery, solid character moments, and tension. From there, Capcom weaves a gloriously campy, overheated, Hammer-Horror-meets-Cronenberg epic. Without giving anything away, Village serves up plenty of twists that not only tie the game to the greater RE mythos in interesting ways but challenge what you thought you knew about the world of Resident Evil Village and RE7 before it. No, this isn’t The Last of Us, the story is not high art, but it’s one of the most enjoyable RE yarns to date in its own goofy way.The world of Resident Evil Village is further bolstered with impressive visuals, featuring intricately detailed environments and ray-tracing-enhanced lighting and reflections. HDR is pushed hard, giving the game a saturated, warm look in places like Castle Dimitrescu and a stark, icy cool chill in the titular village. Every area in the game has its own unique look and feel. Ray-tracing isn’t used in an overly flashy way but enhances the game's overall look nicely, usually without a major cost to performance (I only noticed a small handful of momentary framerate dips).If you’ve survived Resident Evil 7, you know the basics of what to expect from Resident Evil Village. While the game is first-person, this is not a full-on shooter. Ethan moves and maneuvers rather slowly, but thankfully, you do have a handy block button for fending off enemies that get up in your face. Crafting of healing items and ammo returns from RE7 and a RE4-style merchant named The Duke has been added. The store is a welcome return, featuring a wider range of weapons and upgrades to collect than in any previous RE game. You can even do a little hunting and get The Duke to cook up some tasty recipes that will permanently boost Ethan’s abilities.In terms of level design, Resident Evil Village is a mix of notes, some pitch-perfect, some a bit flat. Let’s get the biggest disappointment out of the way first – the game’s titular village isn’t terribly groundbreaking. Your introduction to the village is effective, and it’s used well in a late-game sequence, but overall it’s not as large or open as I was hoping it would be. No moment in this game’s village rises to the level of that unforgettable first encounter with the possessed townspeople of Resident Evil 4. Everything just feels a bit hemmed in. But really, the village is just a hub and in that regard, it does its job perfectly well. Just don’t expect Village’s highlights to take place in its actual village.Thankfully, the areas the village connects to are often very good. RE Village is roughly split into four main areas in addition to the village hub, each ruled over by one of the “Four Lords” who serve the mysterious Mother Miranda. There’s the stylish and imposing Alcina Dimitrescu, ghostly puppeteer Donna Beneviento, twisted Lovecraftian beast Salvatore Moreau, and smug werewolf-commanding Karl Heisenberg. Lady Dimetrescu’s legion of, uh, admirers will be happy to know her section of the game is fantastic – a theatrical romp through a lavish castle that mixes atmosphere, action, and exploration in just the right proportions. Even those not into Lady Dimitrescu’s whole thing will have a blast running from her as she swoops through the halls like an infinitely-more-glamorous Mr. X.Once you wrap up Castle Dimitrescu you’ll visit the deliciously creepy House Beneviento, where you’ll have your weapons and items stolen, forcing you to survive on just your brainpower. This section of the game is reminiscent of the opening of Resident Evil 7 or atmospheric indie horror games like Layers of Fear or Visage and honestly gives them all a run for their money in terms of tension and disturbing imagery. Personally, I would have liked to see more sequences like this spread throughout Resident Evil Village, but this one section is all we get.Really, this is my only major issue with Resident Evil Village. The game is so eager to get to the next thing, the next idea, that sometimes it discards things that are working a little too quickly. After the excellent Dimitrescu and Beneviento stages, the game goes a bit slack for a few hours. Salvatore Moreau’s section is unique from a gameplay perspective, as you have to scramble over the rooftops of a flooded village in order to avoid a giant sea creature, but the area’s visually grungy and lacking in atmosphere. Meanwhile, the Heisenberg’s Factory area is more or less your typical action-heavy Resident Evil fare. Don’t get me wrong, neither of these sections are bad. RE fans will likely still enjoy them; they just don’t quite measure up to Village’s best moments. Speaking of best moments, the game rallies in its final hours, delivering a memorable finale filled with twists, turns, big bosses, and crazy setpieces.Ultimately, Capcom knows when to deliver its big punches, and it begins and ends RE Village with a proper bang. They also leave players with some nice treats after the credits roll, including a solid new incarnation of Mercenaries mode and tons of concept art and extras with interesting behind-the-scenes details attached. You’re left with a game that feels like a high-class horror buffet. The game throws so much at you over the course of its packed 12-to-15-hour campaign that you’re guaranteed to find plenty to enjoy, even if there’s a few things you may be tempted to push to the side of your plate.This review was based on a PS5 copy of Resident Evil Village provided by publisher Capcom. You can grab the game on PC at a small discount from Green Man Gaming. Resident Evil Village is a wild, thrilling ride across seemingly every horror genre and idea that happened to pass through the mad minds at Capcom. Not every aspect of the game is perfect, but its highs are very high and solid core mechanics and excellent presentation hold the grisly patchwork together. You may survive Resident Evil Village, but your thoughts will linger there long after you’ve escaped. The links above are affiliate links.
