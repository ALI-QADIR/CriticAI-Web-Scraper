God of War Ragnarök,Chris Tapsell,Eurogamer,https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-glorious-excess-makes-a-triumphant-return,"Bigger and Baldur.
Despite the ostensibly modern tone, God of War's Norse revival has always seemed retro by nature. That 2018 mega-hit, and indeed God of War: Ragnarök, its hugely anticipated follow-up, are Metroidvanias at heart, games that have you explore a world of mazing, criss-crossing tunnels and interlocking paths, that tease you past closed doors waiting to be opened on some later, more empowered return, or through secret ones you never knew existed. 

These worlds live in service to two of video games' most distinctly video-gamey moments: the ""Aha! At last,"" of finally smashing that purple obstacle with your new purple spell, and the ""Huh! Didn't expect to wind up here"" of emerging into sunlight through the exit of some dark, hidden passageway, pockets clinking with the sound of plundered gold. The result is a curious tension. Of all the recent blockbusters awarded the dubious title of ""cinematic experience,"" God of War was the one that still carried the untamed heart of a video game.

It might seem a tiny bit facile, but that tension really was the crux of 2018's game: just as Kratos attempted to move on from a past he looked upon with shame, the series attempted to leave its excessive, often puerile tendencies behind, replacing quick-time-event sex scenes and cartoonish style with a solemn, intimate father-son tale. There's an argument, however, that God of War maybe over-compensated just a tad, its self-seriousness occasionally turning to a naval-gazing self-regard. But still it couldn't help itself: Godly skulls were pummelled, wolfman jaws were ripped off, somewhere in there, buried and denied, the old Kratos never really went away. 

In Ragnarök that tension continues. If anything its dialled up, in the way that many sequels often are, each of the disparate parts - the size of the world, the length of the story, the number of characters and skill trees, crafting screens, and pixels on the TV - growing exponentially, the emphasis on providing more of what people loved, rather than the balance of how it all knits together. But, crucially, this is a tension Ragnarök aims to resolve. And it does. After taking an awful lot of time to think about it, this game, like its protagonists, realises what it truly is, and finally learns to love itself for it. The result is big and silly - and deliriously satisfying.

God of War: Ragnarök picks up three years after the events of God of War, with Kratos and his son Atreus - never ""Boy"" in Ragnarök - hiding out in their humble cabin. Atreus is ""coming into some powers,"" as teenage gods do, and coming into a bit of an attitude problem as well, not helped by the obscured prophecy found at the end of God of War. The events of the previous game have had consequences, too: Freya, Queen of the imposing Valkyries and mother to the slain villain-god Baldur, has turned from ally to nemesis, desperate for revenge. 

Parental wrath is, unsurprisingly, a running theme here. Magni and Modi, two more insufferable Norse gods, or Aesir, were also killed by us in the first game and have a rueful father in Thor, wonderfully imagined as a towering, belligerent strongman - eventually he proves a mirror for Kratos, a what-if outcome, were he to let his self-loathing run free. Most important of all is Baldur's father and 'All Father' of the nine realms, Odin, a master of knowledge and spies rendered here as a kind of magnanimous mob boss, cloak draped over his shoulders like both the closed wings of his ravens and the overcoat of Don Fanucci.

The Aesir take more prominence in God of War: Ragnarök than you might initially expect, and they're an odd bunch, as the characters of Norse mythology are in general. Their inter-family feuds play out with mixed success - Freya takes surprising, but well-earned prominence in a few ways, and her quest for retribution feels powerful. Others feel like crossovers from the Twilight Saga, all pallid and pompous and unnervingly West Coast. Ragnarök, as a concluding entry to this only two game long saga, clearly feels a pressure to include as much of the canon as possible, a completionist streak that can leave it feeling both bloated and crowded as a result. It can't help but keep throwing more characters at you, more references to backstory lore or minor incidents from the previous game, to the extent that I half expected the log you carry during the first tutorial to turn up and deliver a soliloquy. 

This bloat is without doubt the biggest problem for Ragnarök. With more efficiency its story could be told in half the time, with half the characters, and in its tropey, misunderstanding-fuelled middle hours it sags under the weight of it all, falling into the mopier tendencies of the previous game but without the tight, double-act focus that kept it moving. There are a huge amount of cutscenes, which flow beautifully in and out of the player-controlled action with more sophistication than ever - God of War isn't the only game to use a one-shot take for its camerawork, but I still marvel at it, the amount of cross-team coordination that must take. 

But there are still too many of them, forgotten lovers and brothers and probably someone's cousin's pet dog getting lengthy screen time each - likely, I suspect, because of an urge to ""do justice"" to each minor character's arc, to prevent them from feeling used by the story. If that's the reason, it's slightly misguided thinking - there are more tools in the best writers' arsenals than lengthy conversation for making characters feel alive. A single, well-formed expression can deliver as much depth and nuance as half an hour with some of Ragnarök's chats.

In these moments the story's problems seep into its gameplay, each puzzle feeling more and more like it exists purely to stall for time so yet more quippy Marvel banter can be used to retreat the same exhausted, overstretched themes once more - trust! Self-doubt! Fate and prophecy! This is part of the natural tension with games like God of War: Ragnarök. For a game designed around play sessions that last for one self-contained hour, it makes complete sense to rehash conversations in order to embed you back into a story you might've spent a week away from. In longer chunks though, it struggles - a victim of the intense way these games are reviewed, sure but plenty will blast through sections over a weekend, by the end of which you might marvel at the amount of words shared without an inkling of progress.

Chatter is also a key problem for that puzzling, too, which makes up at least a solid half of what you'll be doing in God of War: Ragnarök. I love God of War's puzzles. They're simple and mechanistic but tuned in such a way as to just tickle the exact right part of your brain, the lizardy bit that likes tightening screws on wobbly chairs and lining notebooks up with the edge of your desk. This goes here, put that on that, turn this and, tada! Open sesame. I never tire of it, and there are more than ever in Ragnarök. 

But Ragnarök does try its best to undermine my enjoyment at times, thanks to a truly overbearing urge to offer you hints. You will not look at a puzzle for more than a few seconds before one companion or another (there are many, all as overeager as the next) tells you the solution. ""Maybe that lever could help, brother!"" Yeah? The lever I'm pulling right now? You don't say, Mimir! The joy of these puzzles is that they are actually incredibly simple but they make you feel like they're complicated because of the visuals, the sense of whirring mechanism, all the satisfaction coming from how you feel smart for solving them, watching the micro-chain of cause and effect start to flow like you're the master of your little universe. Patronising you with a solution before you can even nock the required magic arrow - and a dog-training ""Well done!"" after the fact, for good measure - often spoils the fun.

Crucially, though, there is an awful lot of fun. The flipside to having an overlong story is that it means there is simply more of this game, something the majority will want - as I did, to my surprise, even after finally reaching its end - and will gladly pay the price of a few more skippable cutscenes to enjoy. The world of God of War: Ragnarök is vast and really quite strange - I spent a large part of my time with it reaching for the right analogy to describe it, but really, Ragnarök is a theme park. 

In fact, it's a lot like a theme park - the more you sit with that thought the more it all lines up. Along your journey you will ride rollercoasters through mountains, log flumes through mines, take oh-so-many guided boat tours through new regions - Elf land! Dwarf land! The one where you'll get to pet wild animals! You'll meet your favourite heroes. You'll wonder how Brok and Sindri, the walking mascots of this universe, will manage to appear simultaneously in one realm and some other, but never two at once. Do they have some secret network of mascot tunnels? Multiple actors in the same costumes? Each side mission functions as an attraction, often a literal island with a tightly contained ten minutes of fun. The closer you look the more irrefutable it becomes, from the way the game's extras move like animatronic puppets behind picket fences and tavern bars, right down to the invisible walls along its many linear paths, that all seem to guide you, through the mystic art of psychological engineering - the spacing of paving slabs, the use of light - from one attraction to the next. By the end it's clear: this is a complete Disney World of Adventure through the nine Norse realms.

I mean this as a compliment. One of Ragnarök's real achievements is in how it has progressed beyond a reliance on mere visual fidelity to provide its spectacle. It's mined Norse myths for their weirdness, their idiosyncrasies that set them apart and give this modern series its oddly gaudy, outsized charm. It has fun with size, in fact, having you duck beneath dwarven rafters one moment and scarper about amongst giant bric-a-brac the next. Its realms are more varied, less oppressive and so more inviting for your eventual return, and gloriously colourful but importantly, playful with that colour. Big, platform tentpole blockbusters, much like the recent output from Marvel, their cousins in entertainment, often equate vivid colour (usually purple) with cohesive visual creativity, but Ragnarök makes some effort in places to play with texture and tone, if still not really going for it with form. 

Combat, similarly, retains much of its structural rigidness, which in this case is a slight shame. I would've loved a more systemic approach to its elements, of which there are a few now - I can imagine a world where this game lets you manipulate enemies in more interesting ways, throwing them into one another after a grab with the Blades of Chaos for instance, rather than the usual pull-you-to-me, or me-to-you whiplash. There is a bit of synergy across skills that do more damage when using your frosty Leviathan axe on an enemy you've set ablaze, for instance, but there's very little room for expression. 

Fights in this game are designed to be structured cinema, where you can chain a few high-cooldown abilities with sumptuous, choreographed fluidity (a quick word on how animations can cancel from an attack into an execution, for instance, without you breaking flow for even a moment: stunning work). This style will make for some marvellous GIFs and glittering social media compilations, and the sense of impact - the attention to each flick of the wrist, click of the fingers, glint of metal, clang of armour, scream of rage, even the timing of combat frames and the basics of keeping battlefields plain so the combat itself and burst with visual noise - is just unparalleled. But the satisfaction that this is all for is immediate, which is the best and worst part of it all: at any moment you can hold L1 and press R2 to feel like a god, but the deeper sense of achievement in games will always come from overcoming the odds in the face of your mortality.

Much of the last God of War's shortcomings - and there were a few - have been thoroughly mended here, though. Enemy variety was a justified complaint, and clearly heard loud and clear at Santa Monica Studio (one previously ever-present enemy type is even acknowledged with some nicely self-deprecating humour). There's no risk of repetition in Ragnarök. There are far more designs, but variety comes with more depth than that too. You'll need to use a far wider range of abilities to get by - shield bashes, companion abilities, weapons - and adapt to attacks of different speed, height, and direction. Occasionally the over-the-shoulder camera is a little tight, and despite a button for quickly switching to behind you this can still be a bit of a hindrance. 

But still, the variety of it all - bosses in particular, is a real boon, a vast improvement from 2018. Within minutes you'll have fought what feels like more sub-bosses than the entirety of the previous game could offer. Many of these are quite typical - prepare to aim for glowing weak spots and turn attacks against their owners - but there are so many different ones it never feels rote. 

They also improve dramatically as time goes by. God of War has a fight on its hands with boss encounters, thanks to a couple of superlative battles in fellow first-party exclusive Returnal. Next to the bullet hell, score attack retro vibes that game could call upon to summon flowstate zen through pounding techno and screen-filling particles it would always be a struggle, especially as there, tension came from circumstance - the sheer desperation to avoid yet another lengthy run to the boss. Here, tension is conjured through force of will, a typically desperate, occasionally overblown but never less than epic score from Bear McCreary, the pounding battle drum of Ragnarök's dialogue, those repetitive lines chanted like a prayer before war. 

Above all, though, Ragnarök's dramatic might comes from its unique access to a sense of scale, a sense that was so sorely missed in the previous game and remedied with conviction here at last. You will fight some big, ugly monsters in God of War: Ragnarök, you will climb on their backs, lash at them with your blades, bellow defiance up to them from below. You'll stand silhouetted, jagged, cartoonishly angular in front of them. Finally, deep into this game, you will get a bit of the old Kratos back, a bit of PS2 excess will break free of its self-conscious cage. It takes a long time to get there, but this is a series that's needed to do a little soul-searching, to work through its own awkward teenage phase and wince at its old regrets. Its own heroes prove to be just the tonic.

What if it was [whisper it] just… okay? I loved the last game but it set a pretty high bar, one which Ragnarok just about brushes with outstretched fingertips. It's not quite as good as the last game, but it's damn close, and a God of War running at 90% is still better than most things out there.Release date: November 9, 2022
Platform(s): PS5, PS4
Developer: Sony Santa Monica
Publisher: Sony Interactive EntertainmentTo be clear: God of War Ragnarok is a great game, with eventually weighty emotional moments, incredibly satisfying puzzles, and combat that's never less than enjoyable. The only thing letting it down is that developer Sony Santa Monica doesn't really know what to do with the first half of the experience. After an incredibly emotional opening (be warned, there will be tears) the wheels sort of spin for a while with no clear direction. There's always something to do, or an objective to chase, but some sort of spark is missing and the momentum that finally picks up and barrels you through the ending takes a while to get going.  The 2018 game crackled with energy as Kratos and Atreus struggled with grief and each other – the growing pains of both Kratos' fatherly responsibilities and Atreus' burgeoning adulthood could make almost any moment an emotional experience or friction filled clash of wills. ""There are consequences…"" Kratos famously states in the previous game during a key event, and here that doesn't feel the case for while. The pair operate as a functional team (more or less) and while Ragnarok is coming, little seems to change at first, leaving the literal apocalypse to feel more like a McGuffin to move characters around the plot. As a result, the opening hours struggle to find any sense of weight.God of War Ragnarok is still great to play at this point, but for the first 15 hours or so it feels like it's treading water; stretched out and playing for time. Almost everything you do in this period has basically a minimal net gain. At best, you'll earn a small plot advancement that doesn't quite feel like adequate pay off for the time it took. After I spent half an hour collecting fruit I had no idea how the story was going to get to Ragnarok itself, and I was starting to worry that it didn't either.However, once certain elements fall into place you can feel everything palpably kick up a notch, and the stakes aren't so much raised as thrown into the air. Past a critical point it's like having the 2018 game back – lines and events will make you gasp out loud, there are lump in the throat moments, probably some more tears, and scenes that burn themselves into your memory. Where the opening half is mostly amiable chit chat about maybe checking out the next objective, the closing feels like you're being repeatedly punched in the gut and the heart alternately until it's all over. Kratos continues to be one of the most interesting character reformations in video games, and by the time the credits rolled I was happy for him in a way I wasn't expecting. He suffers most from the slow start, feeling barely present at times, but both he and Atreus ultimately go on a journey in every sense of the word. And, of the two, it's him that travels furthest. I obviously won't spoil anything, but by the end I didn't know if I wanted to do a private little air-punching 'yes!' or just rush up and hug that big beard. Nearly every character benefits when things take off and the script gets more meat to it. I never expected Sindri to be a firm favorite, for example. Thor is a flawed man and a layered villain in the mold of Balder. While Odin exudes an amiable, quietly spoken threat that leaks danger, usually more the nicer he gets. I'm not quite sure how well God of War Ragnarok handles certain elements of the plot that relate to abuse, addiction, and mental health, but I'll leave that to people with far more experience and wisdom than me to break down. In terms of overall progression and gameplay, God of War Ragnarok feels a little more focused than its predecessor, often with more linear and direct paths to main objectives that reward you with an open area of side quests to explore once a crucial objective has been ticked off. There's also more in the way of puzzles – just about every door needs something spun, burned, or whacked in some way. They're just the right level of challenge to always feel satisfying, although it feels like the early stages are either playing for time or not big enough to properly space the puzzles out. At the start you can barely take a step without having to trigger a mechanism somewhere.As the story picks up and becomes more meaningful, there's a little less busy work and the open areas you unlock expand in scope. They're all fairly self-contained but stack up, crisscrossing the realms, to create a pleasing raft of side missions to snack on – ghosts that need help, Nornir chests to open, fights and monsters to beat, and more. Earlier areas can be cleared quite quickly, and you'll rarely ever find a side quest that takes more than a few minutes, but by the time you're finished the story there's a generous helping of stuff to keep it going. One area in particular has a real endgame vibe as well, with a level of complexity and layering far exceeding the rest, which will take some time to unravel. I finished the story somewhere around the 35 hour mark, with a fair amount of wandering and side stuff under my belt and now, around 45-50 hours in, I'm still exploring and finding new stuff.There's obviously a lot of fighting as you explore all this, and the combat continues to feel heavy and impactful, even as Ragnarok introduces more simplified systems. The core of combat is still balancing the focused icy damage of Kratos' Leviathan Axe to wail on single enemies, while the fiery hell of his Blades of Chaos burn everything around you. The enchantment system, which let you add buffs to gear in the previous game, has now been moved to a single amulet that can take nine enchantments. Each one buffs different stats like health, damage, and so on, but come as part of a trio – matching two or three of the set then powers up a different perk. It's much easier to manage a build in Ragnarok, particularly as different armor sets are more clearly focused on damage, cooldowns, Runic (magic) and other key stats.  I found God of War Ragnarok an oddly split experience overall. There's a light start that feels padded – still good but missing depth – which leads into a weighty finish that's every bit the equal of its predecessor. But despite feeling like a 15 hour story trying to fill a 30 hour game, God of War Ragnarok is still easily one of the best PS5 games. Even when it feels a bit thin, that's largely in comparison to the last game, with this maintaining that same absurd level of polish, and entertainment, even when the story feels like it's filling for time. When the dial does finally crank up to 11 you can feel it kick in, and by the end there are some incredible beats and a hugely satisfying resolution overall. God of War Ragnarok was reviewed on PS5, with a code provided by the publisher.I'm GamesRadar's Senior Guides Co-ordinator, which means I run GamesRadar's guides and tips content.

God of War Ragnarök,David Jenkins,Metro GameCentral,https://metro.co.uk/2022/11/03/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-a-myth-of-father-and-son-17693887/,"The biggest PS4 and PS5 exclusive of the year is finally here but can Ragnarök live up to the spectacle of the previous God Of War?The 2018 God Of War deserves to be remembered as one of the greatest franchise reinventions of all time. Despite the subtitle-less name it was not a reboot, but instead a direct continuation of the story of Kratos – a god of war from Ancient Greece who up until that point had been one of gaming’s most loathsomely amoral protagonists. The games are almost unplayable nowadays, for anyone that’s not a terminally moody teenager, and yet they had to have existed in order for the new game to happen, and for Kratos to embark on one of the greatest redemptive journeys that gaming has ever seen.If God Of War had been some low budget indie game its themes would not have seemed so surprising, but it was a massive budget AAA PlayStation exclusive and Sony deserve just as much credit for publishing it as Santa Monica Studio do for making it. By the end of the game Kratos was transformed, from a heartless monster into not only a loving father but someone that wanted to seek out and help other people.You might think that leaves nowhere for the sequel, on both PlayStation 5 and 4, to go but while, at the start of this new game, Kratos has become overly protective of his son he’s still a good person (well, god) and becomes even better through the course of this new journey. The character-based storytelling is exceptional on any level, but most especially for such a violent, previously nihilistic, action game franchise.Although the above is all true, judging the game as a whole it’s clear it’s not quite so perfectly formed as its predecessor. The primary problem, oddly, is the plot, which is so vaguely sketched that at times it seems almost non-existent. At the beginning of the game Kratos and his son Atreus – who has learnt his Nordic name is Loki – are merely trying to stay out of everyone’s way, since their actions in the previous game caused the start of Ragnarök, an end of the world myth that seems to be everywhere in pop culture at the moment.Not only have the duo upset Odin’s ex-wife Freya, by preventing her son from murdering her, but they’ve also attracted the attention of Odin and Thor – although at the beginning of the game there’s a half-hearted attempt at a truce, which is actually a ruse for Odin to try and convince Atreus to fulfil a prophecy where he willingly joins him.The game spends an awful lot of time meditating on the concept of unavoidable fate, which is fine in the context of Nordic beliefs at the time but is hardly a subject that needs much arguing against in the modern day. It does, however, bring to mind the themes of Terminator 2 and we suspect that film has been a great influence here, given it’s also a violent action experience with an anti-war message.It’s debatable how clearly that concept, and the one about the perils of seeking vengeance, is put across by the conclusion of the story, but the biggest problem with the plot is how formless it is. Odin is not a very proactive adversary and Kratos and his allies spend an awful lot of time talking about how they don’t know what to do or where to go, which becomes increasingly demoralising when you’re already feeling that way as a player. This ends up making everything seem very directionless, with the plot’s goals all being very vague until almost the last moment.It’s a good job, then, that all the action is still as much fun as ever. God Of War is a third person action game not dissimilar to other big name Sony franchises, but with much more involved combat and only a semi-open world structure.Kratos still has his axe from the last game, but it can now generate ice powers, which are more effective against certain enemies. From the start of the game, he can also use his Blades of Chaos, from the original trilogy, which generate fire. A third weapon, with more vaguely defined wind powers, is introduced much later, but worrying about the elemental effects is rarely necessary and the pause while Kratos switches weapons means you can’t mix up combos Bayonetta or Devil May Cry style.The combat does have more depth to it than before, and there are separate skill trees to unlock for each of the weapons but, much like the story, they’re utilised in the most imprudent way possible. Whenever you upgrade a weapon, to unlock a new level in the skill tree, you usually have enough experience points to instantly buy them all at once. Even with the first set of abilities, you unlock so many at once it’s overwhelming.This is a terrible idea because some of the moves and abilities involve very specific control commands (which is good) but because they take time to learn, and you’re suddenly bombarded with half a dozen at once, it’s very easy to completely forget about them. The game isn’t especially easy but on normal difficulty we were often aware we were only ever using a small subset of the available moves, with the game providing no incentive or reminder to do anything else.These issues were present in the original but are exacerbated here because of the multiple weapons. However, Ragnarök does improve on the role-playing elements from the last game, which previously felt like mere inventory busywork. There are still too many special amulets, runes, and other buff-providing items but they’re easier to manage this time round and if nothing else there’s an auto-equip button.The puzzles have got very stale though, and while a few are quite clever none are very interesting, with far too many involving freezing gears to keep doors open or working out a way to move a crane so you can swing across a gap. These account for what must be 75% of the game’s puzzles and when you get a bunch of them in a row, which happens more than once, it begins to feel disappointingly uninspired. Although it’s even more irritating that whoever your companion is will blurt out the solution just seconds after you start trying to work it out.Ragnarök’s other problem is that the majority of realms you visit are places you’ve been before. The nine realms are a big part of Nordic mythology but most of them were already featured in the first game, so there are a lot of return visits. They’re mostly new areas, and there’s always an attempt to add something new – such as the puzzles involving bouncing your axe off special gems in the elf realm of Alfheim – but that can’t prevent the feeling of déjà vu.You spend a lot of time in Vanaheim and Svartalfheim, which weren’t featured in the original, but the former is a fairly stock example of a forest world and while the latter is the home of the dwarves the place still manages to look completely deserted even when you’re in the capital city.Although there is a variety of different companions, including some substantial playtime as Atreus (who plays surprisingly similarly to Kratos, despite his bow), in terms of the world you’re exploring everything feels so empty and lifeless. That was also the case in the previous game and we’re still not sure what the explanation is meant to be within the game’s lore.What’s especially frustrating about the locations is that they all follow the same formula and structure, with very little variation in terms of visuals or basic layout. There’s one noticeable exception that riffs on Jack and the Beanstalk style iconography, which is easily one of the most interesting sequences in the game, but it’s the only diversion like that.The graphics are overall very good, even if the facial animation is beginning to look a bit outdated, but the worlds you explore are disappointingly uninteractive and artificial. Whether you can or cannot climb or jump off a cliff often seem arbitrary, with the otherwise unstoppable Kratos often having his progress impeded by a small ledge.The use of invisible walls often means you can’t sidle round objects you could obviously fit between, all of which begins to recall the feeling of touring a theme park attraction. This impression is reinforced in Svartalfheim, in particular, which is full of fences with lots of dwarven mining equipment on the other side, which really does make it feel like you’re just walking through a Christmas grotto.Santa Monica Studio has already confirmed this will be the last entry to be based on Nordic myths and it’s easy to imagine there are multiple reasons for this, not least the fact that what was originally a startlingly innovative take on a moribund franchise is quickly starting to feel old hat. Many were upset that this is a cross-gen game and it’s clear everything has been designed for the limitations of the PlayStation 4, with no obvious use of the PlayStation 5’s power.Beyond that, there’s just a lot of very odd design decisions. This extends even to the voice-acting, which is very good on a technical level but has some bizarre choices in terms of accents – as well as noticeably more modern dialogue than last time, which often feels out of place. Almost every character is very obviously American, and this includes a dwarf that talks like a Southern belle stereotype and Odin’s actor who seems to be channelling Steve Buscemi in a Mafia role.The only accents that are even remotely Nordic are reserved for nameless, cannon fodder enemies. The one obvious exception is Mimir, voiced by Scottish actor Alastair Duncan, who we can only assume was being paid for how many times he could utter the word ‘brother’ in a single game. He’s far more annoying than he was in the original but, again, the game makes things worse by having all the other characters keep commenting on it.Despite the flaws, Ragnarök is still a very entertaining game. It’s longer than its predecessor and while, like the last the game, the combat and limited range of enemies does start to get old a little before the end there’s a mountain of post-game content that will still have you coming back for more.The end, which naturally we’re not going to spoil here, is a little disappointing though, not just because the final battles are slightly underwhelming but because there’s what many will see as a cop-out in terms of the story. Expectations are subverted at numerous points but the one at the end feels like the least interesting direction they could have taken things.Ragnarök’s greatest success is not the action, the exploration, and certainly not the plot. Instead, it’s the relationship between Kratos and Atreus, which is going to resonate strongly with everyone, but especially fathers and sons or those from a troubled family.Everything from the sacrifices necessary to become a parent to the awful inevitability of dealing with a parent whose time may be coming to an end are handled organically and in a very relatable manner – despite the fantastical nature of the characters. Questions of forgiveness, guilt, and dealing with loss are channelled through other characters as well, although there are enough inconsistences with Freya’s portrayal that she doesn’t seem quite so believable.The gradual thawing of Kratos’ personality, his struggle to communicate his love for his son, and Atreus’ attempts to both support his father and forge his own path are handled so masterfully well it seems all the stranger that the game could have made such obvious mistakes elsewhere.There’s even a successful attempt to humanise Thor and his kin, somewhat in the style of The Last Of Us Part 2, which again is impressively subtle in the way it depicts a fractured but still loving family.Sony forced to reveal PlayStation exclusive deals by US senatorSuper Mario movie could make Nintendo $1,100,000,000 as it continues to break recordsDead Island 2 leaks 30 minutes of gameplay footage - still looking really goodAction video games always struggle to tell meaningful stories about normal human emotions, for the simple fact that for the majority of any game you’re constantly killing people or things, but here it works. The context of everyone being a god or mythological being helps but mostly it’s just good writing, good performances, and the willingness to take time out from the action to show how the characters feel and how the events are affecting them – and all without any overlong cut scenes.Ragnarök gets some things wrong but the things it gets right almost no other action game ever has, and that at least is a godlike achievement.In Short: A more flawed experience than its predecessor, with a sense that the formula is already starting to wear thin, but the character-based storytelling with Kratos and his son is handled masterfully well.Pros: Excellent combat with plenty of depth, even if the game seems desperate to hide it from you. Huge game world, with mountains of content. Fantastic characterisation for the two leads.Cons: The plot is a formless jumble and most of the locations are overfamiliar and lacking in interactivity. Flawed skill trees and repetitive puzzles.Score: 8/10Formats: PlayStation 5 (previewed) and PlayStation 4Price: £69.99Publisher: Sony Interactive EntertainmentDeveloper: Santa Monica StudioRelease Date: 9th November 2022Age Rating: 18Email gamecentral@metro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter.

God of War Ragnarök,Kyle Hilliard,Game Informer,https://www.gameinformer.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok/next-to-godliness,"To call the 2018 God of War a sequel almost does it a disservice. Yes, it was a continuation of Kratos’ original multi-game journey, but it placed him and a new family in a foreign world to reflect on his past and try to secure his future. Kratos’ journey to connect to his son while battling a new legion of distrustful gods was a revelation in both video game storytelling and action, setting a high bar for the inevitable sequel. Ragnarök may lack the unique impact of the prior game, but everything that worked so well the first time comes forward, along with a story that earns the proper definition of the term epic.
 
Ragnarök basically picks up exactly where the previous left off in terms of narrative. Atreus is a little older and has shed the ‘boy’ nickname entirely. In a tradition established early in the God of War series, the opening hours are stellar. The action kicks off immediately, setting up new foes and old friends, but among all the explosive set pieces are quiet moments of engrossing performance showcase. Newcomer Odin and returning scorned mother Freya’s characterizations are particularly fantastic, but even the weakest performance in Ragnarök makes the typical video game performance pale in comparison.The excellent moment-to-moment writing outdoes the already fantastic dialogue of the 2018 game. Ragnarök is, surprisingly, the funniest God of War to date. Kratos is the most stoic, straight man in all the nine realms and he surrounds himself with vulgar dwarves, a wisecracking decapitated head, a sometimes over-confident teenager, and more. I laughed often as Kratos said things like, “I do not need a snack,” when Sindri offered him food, or when he shared a dismissive grunt when characters made fun of him for only ever offering dismissive grunts. As key as the story has become to this new era of God of War, the combat remains an equally important element. The most negative thing to be said about fighting the various enemies of the nine realms is it isn’t radically different or changed from the previous game. You start with more weapons this time around, but the core combos are mostly the same. The library of special attacks you can pull off is larger, but I admit I found my favorites early on and was not particularly compelled to experiment.
 
The types of enemies you fight, on the other hand, has greatly expanded. Mini bosses are numerous, and when they repeat, a new wrinkle is typically added, or it is a fully optional pursuit. The optional content, which accounts for far more than additional boss fights, makes up a large percentage of an already massive game. Alongside side quests to pursue next to the main path, there are also large open areas to be explored at your leisure with sled dogs that offer worthwhile moments of character development and tangible rewards. In some cases, I completed side stories with big, important moments and only learned they had been optional afterward.Ragnarök, despite its fantastic setting, does feature a grounded tone thanks to its splendid performances and fully realized characters, but it is not afraid to be a fun video game. Puzzles expertly mix up the pace between combat encounters, and I was constantly impressed with how there always seemed to be story context for engaging in the video game parts. When ignoring the main task to find treasure chests, for example, Atreus would always take time to explain to the new characters that his dad likes loot. Despite the urgency of the story, Mimir would often make sure to state that we can take our time and explore if we want to. These little moments and bits of dialogue showcase Sony Santa Monica fully understands how its players want to interact with its game, and I was always thankful for that understanding.
 
Considering the player at every moment extends to the exceptional level design, as well. Whether visiting new versions of old locations or entirely new realms, each area wraps around itself to reveal shortcuts, or bypasses the need to backtrack. The well-designed combat arenas feature multiple levels to fight on and environmental attack options, like grabbing a giant rock to fling at that particularly pesky lizard. Even the way the player camera moves to hint at optional chests or tease new paths is impressive and consistent. The players’ direction is always considered.
 
God of War Ragnarök feels a lot like God of War (2018), which is a compliment considering how fantastic that game is. Sony Santa Monica was right to not break what wasn’t broken and it has expertly continued the story threads that were left hanging from the previous game. Any complaints about the overall experience (familiar combat, collecting and leveling up equipment isn’t particularly interesting) are quickly forgotten in the face of the compelling narrative, believable character relationships, and incredible visuals and animation. Even from its early PlayStation 2 days, the God of War series has always set a high, quality bar for itself, and with few exceptions, it manages to leap above that bar. God of War Ragnarök is no different.

   on November 3, 2022 at 9:00AM PDTGod of War Ragnarok is a lavish production with pristine visuals, jaw-dropping scale, crunchy combat that is as satisfying as it is brutal, and a world that begs to have its every corner and crevice explored. It's a spectacular blockbuster, but these are the least of its achievements.In a game where a hulking god rips all manner of creatures limb from limb, the most shocking moments aren't bathed in blood, but carried by poignant words and heartfelt emotions. They are a former God of War--known for mercilessly killing his kin--finding the words to empathize with loss; a despondent child emploring a father to break a self-destructive cycle; a moment of tenderness in the life of a boy that has the weight of the world on his shoulders.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

It's an astoundingly well-written game that deconstructs the mythology of Norse gods and rebuilds it as an odyssey about families. Its story isn't about the end of the world, but those that have a hand in it. They're revered as mythical gods but are characterized by deep flaws, twisted by skewed perspectives, and corrupted by questionable motivations in the same way the people they preside over are. And yet, some also have redemptive qualities. In that respect, Ragnarok's story is told from a grey area where nuances blur the line between heroes and villains; good and evil. By constantly challenging you to reconsider who they are and the factors that drive their actions, these characters remain compelling throughout.There are moments when characters you're not supposed to be rooting for reveal the trials and tribulations that have shaped them, or the demons they battle. This alone is enough to humanize them, but Ragnarok also mirrors the struggles of the protagonists in the antagonists, forcing you to ask yourself, ""If I'm willing to empathize with the good guys because of what they're going through, shouldn't I do the same for the bad guys?"" The answer, it turns out, is very complicated, and that's what makes the story so captivating.Although Kratos and Atreus are the stars of the show, almost every character is in the midst of their own complicated journey. For some, it's one that will lift them from a pit of despair or pull them from darkness and onto a brighter path. For others, it's one that fuels obsessions that could be the undoing of everything and everyone. This is best illustrated by Kratos and Atreus who, by killing Baldur at the end of the last game, act as the harbingers of the end times.The consequences of this moment weigh differently on them, and what they feel is their responsibility because their actions pull them in different directions. Kratos, who has finally learned to guide his son through love instead of fear, focuses on steering him away from conflict and the affairs of the Aesir gods, but does so with the knowledge that his son is prophesized to play a part in Ragnarok and he is destined to die. Atreus, meanwhile, is compelled to prevent Ragnarok and find out who he is as Loki–the name he was given by the Giants–and sets off to find Tyr, the Norse God of War, to achieve his goals. This complicated dynamic serves as the conflict between them: a man that wants to avoid war at all costs, having learned the toll it extracts firsthand, versus a boy who believes war is the only way to unseat a power that has ruined the lives of so many.God of War Ragnarok's most impressive achievements are its exploration of loss and love; grief and growth; determinism and defiance. It's an astoundingly well-written game that deconstructs the mythology of Norse gods and rebuilds it as an odyssey about familiesThose who remember Atreus's power-tripping fledgling God phase from the last game will also remember how frustrating it was to go through that--there's nothing more annoying than an arrogant child. But Ragnarok treats the differences in perspective between father and son in a much different way. Kratos is now reckoning with letting his son forge his own path and learning that holding on too tight could push him away. Atreus has matured since we last saw him and is now more cognizant that his actions can and will have consequences. As a result, the dynamic has shifted to where Kratos is trying to learn about his son instead of defining him, while Atreus does his best to see things from his father's perspective. And in both cases, Mimir's counsel plays a major part in this. The fruits of the journey that both characters underwent in the previous game are carried forward into this sequel and, thanks to the superb writing and acting, the back-and-forths between them are genuinely interesting. There's a newfound sense of mutual respect in these conversations, which is uncharted territory for Kratos, and in turn feeds into the motif of growth that underpins God of War Ragnarok.This is a game where you will see people change in meaningful ways. Without revealing details, new characters and those you became intimately familiar with in the previous game have experiences that profoundly impact them and the people around them. God of War Ragnarok is rich in themes to unpack, from the influence of families and generational trauma to how abuses of power and emotional manipulation can change people. God of War Ragnarok places the Norse pantheon under the harshest of lights to show how deeply flawed they are, and we're able to explore that thoroughly through our own experiences with them, as well as tales told by others that have their own. Mimir, the self-professed smartest man alive, returns to offer his insight on all things Norse history, as do the various writings scattered throughout the realms that recount complex histories, the tales of notable figures, or provide insight into the thoughts and feelings of various characters.God of War Ragnarok is a long game, but at every step of the journey, the writing and characterization make it count. It justifies that runtime by cultivating an intimacy with the characters that is only possible by spending hours and hours with them, learning how they see the world, and what influences their thinking. And pretty much every character is fascinating, but especially the Aesir gods, who can be a cruel bunch at the best of times. With the looming threat of their demise, however, each of them begins to unravel in different ways. For some, their nature becomes concentrated further, which has unfortunate repercussions. Others, however, are forced to rethink what truly matters to them.There have been a lot of takes on Norse mythology, but God of War Ragnarok's is easily one of the most memorable. It's elevated by the presence of Kratos, whose past life as a Greek God provides him with a unique perspective, but also because he's placed at the center of it. The legends that we're used to are molded around him and his son, and they adhere in a way that is truly impressive. When all is said and done, you can stand back and marvel at how neatly– and creatively–different strands of narratives and characterization from older God of War titles, the previous entry in this rebooted series, and Norse mythology as a whole have been weaved together.When it comes to confronting Kratos and Atreus's enemies on the battlefield, God of War Ragnarok doesn't make any drastic departures from the previous game, though there are some new additions and expansions made to key mechanics. Fundamentally, however, the core gameplay remains the same, and this is in its favor. My familiarity with the previous game meant it was very easy to begin tearing my way through the battlefield and the close camera angle offers a dramatic front-row seat to the brutality Kratos's legendary reputation is built upon.There's a maniacal kind of glee that comes from stomping around arenas swinging the trusty Leviathan axe to cleave Draugrs, Elves, dragons, demons, and all manner of other fantastic creatures. Even all these hours later, the thrill of hurling the axe into the distance and then recalling it back to your side hasn't diminished one bit, and with new skill trees to work through, this ability continues to provide ample opportunities to create flashy combos that hit hard.This time around, Kratos also has access to the Blades of Chaos from the outset, and Sony Santa Monica has put them to great use. As well as serving as excellent crowd-control tools and dishing out extra damage to ice-aligned creatures, the fiery blades are also used to emphasize mobility and verticality. Kratos can latch onto enemies and close the distance with them, which means they're very handy for target prioritization and even escape tactics. But they're also essential for quickly ascending to elevated platforms, where enemies often position themselves to take potshots. This means you'll need to have a much keener awareness of your surroundings and ensure these threats are addressed quickly. A small but very welcome new addition is the ability to launch off elevated areas and execute plunging attacks on those below, which ensures that the sense of momentum that is built in skirmishes isn't lost when moving around the battlefield.My favorite weapon remains Kratos's trusty fists, which hit like boulders and generate a significant amount of stun. Like the previous game, enemies have a stun meter which, when filled, opens them up to devastating cinematic finishers that are weapon-specific and usually involve rending something in two, crushing bones, or eviscerating the enemy entirely. It's a wince-inducing kind of viciousness that really drives home the power fantasy of being a god, which is ironic considering that Kratos in God of War Ragnarok is a much more balanced and, I daresay, emotionally stable person. The contrast actually ends up working for the game, as it becomes a stark reminder of how far Kratos has come to be able to cage that kind of beast within him.Combat is thrilling regardless of whether you're fighting a smattering of Draugers or trading blows with gods. It's thoughtfully designed and thoroughly satisfying from the first swing of the axe to the very lastAnother area that has been expanded is shields. You were previously limited to just one, but in Ragnarok, Kratos has access to a wider range of shields. Each one usually has a playstyle it caters to, so for those who want to focus on parrying attacks to create openings, there are a selection that will enable that. But if you're the kind of person that likes to tank damage, bigger and sturdier options are available. Shields also usually have a secondary function that is executed by tapping L1 twice to check an enemy and create space, slam the shield into the ground to break guard, retaliate with a punch that knocks them back, or even rush forward. This new wrinkle further enhances the offensive feel of combat by letting you go from the back foot to the front in an instant. It's a smart little addition that means you can switch up your playstyle, should you want to.Further enhancing what Kratos is capable of are the various role-playing systems that are tied to equipment. Naturally, equipment can be upgraded to improve their strength, the effectiveness of the element they are imbued with, or the power of the unique Runic attack, among other things. But the most tangible additions are often in the attachments, some of which will further enhance attributes while others go so far as to introduce new functionality--like sending consecutive waves of frost with every swing of the axe. Armor is treated similarly, bestowing pluses and minuses to attributes or having a unique effect that is activated by certain conditions. None of this is particularly game-changing or innovative, but it does offer the freedom to create a build for Kratos that caters to your style of play. In my case, for example, I like to play extremely aggressively and adopt high-risk strategies where parrying comes before blocking and dodging. Because of this, I focused on acquiring and upgrading equipment that rewarded me for this aggression. My entire strategy was built around rushing in and punching enemies into submission until they became vulnerable to cinematic executions, which would in turn grant me a burst of health recovery. I combined this with a relic that creates a Realm Shift, effectively slowing down time and giving me another opening to unleash a flurry of strikes or the space to hunt down life-restoring gems that might be on the battlefield.Kratos's aggression is reflected in the enemies, which hit much harder than before and aim to overwhelm. In the early hours, this is fine, but as the game ramps up and trickier enemies appear, the mechanics can struggle under the pressure of the increased speed and aggression. These enemies often absorb much more damage, have multiple phases, or move around and attack from a distance, and in many cases, there can be multiple of them. Because of this, it can often feel like you're being pulled in multiple directions and cracks in the defensive options form. I often found myself in the middle of a series of attacks and then suddenly an enemy would appear from behind, forcing me to disengage either by turning around or rolling out of the way. The quick turn input is now L1 and down on the directional pad, and even as I approached the end of the game, it felt awkward and unreliable to execute, especially in the heat of battle. You can remap this, but I never found a place where I was completely comfortable with it.This also felt like it was breaking the flow of combat, especially since the intensity made it easy to lose track of the on-screen arrow that indicates an attack from behind is coming. The indicator switches from yellow to red to provide some idea of timing, but I still found myself getting clipped a lot. Although this isn't a big deal for much of the game, in the latter half, enemies can stunlock you, so there were numerous occasions where a single enemy would open me up to being pummeled by multiple and I'd die in an instant. These moments arose in a way where I felt ill-equipped and incapable of making Kratos react in a way that could deal with what was being thrown at me, as opposed to not being able to execute because of my own skill. Since there are high-level challenges equivalent to Valkyries from the previous game–and more than a few that are even trickier–this is the kind of thing that can be the difference between life and death. Thankfully, for boss fights at least, God of War Ragnarok is much better about checkpointing as you move through phases. And when you're getting stuck into the combat, Atreus is much more capable this time around. Along with Mimir, he will either do callouts to keep you informed, or fire off some arrows at your command or of his own volition to get threats off you–he's a good lad.Ultimately, although these issues can be irksome, they are small and in the grand scheme of things don't drastically impact how the mechanics coalesce. Combat is much pacier and more dynamic than before, and it is thrilling regardless of whether you're fighting a smattering of Draugers or trading blows with gods. It's thoughtfully designed and thoroughly satisfying from the first swing of the axe to the very last.Kratos and Atreus's battles takes them across all nine realms, which is a change from the previous game where two of the realms were locked away. One of the most interesting parts of God of War Ragnarok is how it reimagines areas that were in the original game. Fimbulwinter is used as a narrative conceit to give these familiar locales new life. In Norse mythology, Fimbulwinter, which translates to ""the long winter,"" serves as the prelude to Ragnarok. In-game, it affects the nine realms in different ways. Midgard for example is besieged by a bitter cold, so when you return to the Lake of The Nine once again, it has completely frozen over. Key areas of the lake that you may have become intimately familiar with in the last game may now be inaccessible as new parts of it open up. A cold wind sweeps across the icy surface of the lake and at the center of it all, Tyr’s temple is now barely recognizable under the buildup of snow. In the distance, icy mountain peaks serve as a backdrop to a single lighting strike, frozen in place as the mark of an intense battle. Naturally, navigation is completely changed since you can no longer sail the waters. Instead, Kratos and Atreus get around on a sled that is pulled by their trusty pet wolves, which is a nice way to mix up the way you get around. At certain points, you can even use their keen sense of awareness to sniff out objectives, which is a nice touch.Svartalfheim, by comparison, looks picturesque from the outskirts, with its bright blue skies. But as you venture deeper into its wetlands, it becomes more desert-like, with craggy rocks awkwardly jutting out and collapsed wooden mining equipment filling the spaces in between. There's an unpleasant, arid atmosphere to it, and yet at the same time, it's quite the visual spectacle to behold, rich in detail and intricate in its construction. Vanaheim, home of the Vanir, is a verdant forest that has reclaimed much of the landscape; trees gently sway in the wind; moss has settled atop the water, and vegetation snakes along stone floors and up onto manmade shrines. And if you take a moment to stop and look around, you'll find wildlife nestled amongst all the green. It's a place that is very alive, which makes it a nice contrast to the coldness of Midgard or the glistening majesty of Alfheim's architecture. There are other areas I won't spoil, some of which have a good amount to see and do, while others serve a specific function.No one area in God of War Ragnarok comes across as big as the Lake of the Nine, but it seems like this is a symptom of how you're constantly moving around a variety of locations as opposed to repeatedly returning to one. Regardless, each realm has a grand sense of scale and, as you move between them, the scope of the world as a whole far eclipses what came before. While the main story campaign moves Kratos and Atreus through all nine realms, there are plenty of side quests to undertake in each of these locations. Yet another testament to the writing is that these quests are never a distraction and always present a good reward, whether that be an item or crafting materials, at the very least. However, most of the time they also deliver some piece of lore, further flesh out a side character, or give Kratos, Atreus, and Mimir something new to bond over.Going anywhere with these characters is an exciting prospect, and I often found myself just wandering around to let conversations play out or hoping that new ones would start. In most cases, they did, and I was treated to valuable character growth. In Ragnarok, Kratos is now more inquisitive, Mimir is always ready and willing to offer his insight, and Atreus takes the opportunity to make jokes at both their expense. And that's something I definitely didn't expect. God of War Ragnarok is a funny game--there are more than a few laugh-out-loud moments that endeared me to this new family unit that developed over the last game and flourishes in its sequel.And that's what distinguishes God of War Ragnarok from its predecessor, and most other action games. Despite being a story about warring gods and the end of the world, the soul of the game is something far more sentimental. You may have noticed that I've avoided mentioning the names of characters or describing plot beats, and that was intentional. To talk more about anything or anyone would be to rob you of some of the most unexpected things that God of War Ragnarok achieves with its narrative and the themes they explore. The last game's thoughtful approach to exploring fatherhood was unexpected, Ragnarok somehow manages to feel like an even more personal tale about the complicated nature of families and the people that make them up. For every moment of brutality, there is one of genuine and relatable emotion. How they land will vary from person to person, but there were multiple that left me with tears welling up. If nothing else, God of War Ragnarok further cements Sony Santa Monica's narrative team as one of the best in the business.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"
God of War Ragnarök,Alexis Ong,Polygon,https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23438548/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-ps5-ps4-release-date,"Filed under:The results are captivating and inconsistentIn 2019, I bought my first PlayStation 4. It was the first Big Console I’d had since the days of the slim PlayStation 2, and it came with God of War (2018), a new game from a series I wasn’t too familiar with. But I fired it up on my shiny new toy, keen to try something different. A big part of my God of War experience — something that didn’t click until later — was the one-off novelty of playing a big blockbuster on a “new” console. And it was fine. It was OK. Sitting down to write this, I realize now that the finer points of the story were almost forgettable, which is kind of what happens when you follow the game-as-a-prestige-movie story path that seems to color a lot of the AAA landscape. In 2022, God of War Ragnarök has improved on that recipe, taking a page from the success and spectacle of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is, in essence, the most non-Marvel Marvel story I’ve seen in a game, from the eminently recognizable story beats — heroes face difficult dilemmas, friends become enemies and vice versa, boy meets girl, beloved characters die, and so on — to its practiced use of comedy and tragedy (the two classical storytelling genders) to push the player’s buttons.Like its predecessor(s), Ragnarök is the distillation of an everyman power fantasy, in which you enact powerful and badass acts of redemptive vengeance upon your enemies while retaining the moral high ground; you are, after all, playing a struggling parent with a whole lot of hang-ups. And while the writing does a much better job at building out the characters and their respective places in this world, the end result is a passably good but unevenly paced experience that, more often than not, feels like something I could binge on Disney Plus in any given week. Kratos and Atreus start off in Midgard, quietly reeling from the giants’ prophecy that warned of impending apocalypse and Kratos’ death. Since Baldur died, all nine realms have been thrust into Fimbulwinter — a precursor to Ragnarök — which is sort of analogous to drastic, world-ending climate change. Kratos, who shares the same weary countenance as the Ben Affleck Smoking meme, is still figuring out how to be a dad. Atreus is puberty incarnate, Mimir is still a head, and Freya — well, she’s still around, and she’s still mad about Kratos killing her son. It turns out that Atreus has been quietly researching giant lore without Kratos’ knowledge, and poking his nose into what happened to Tyr, the Norse god of war. Things kick off after an unannounced visit from Thor and his father, Odin, and Kratos reluctantly, cautiously agrees to follow his son’s quest. Like the previous game, Ragnarök builds itself around a central hub — a cozy treehouse where Kratos, Atreus, and Mimir make their home base. Gameplay is pretty much the same, too: They explore different realms, carve their way through hostile locals, and solve intermittent puzzles. Kratos has both his signature weapons, along with new toys that pop up along the way (one appears after the midway point, in one of the game’s many pacing issues), like a helpful amulet that gives you a variety of build options; Atreus has his own skill tree, along with largely cosmetic armor and limited bow upgrades. There are all the usual hallmarks of modern AAA game design: treasure chests, minibosses, and a Herculean grind to make your way through locked gates. Kratos still doesn’t have a dedicated jump button, but that’s fine — he’s a big boy.The universal core of Ragnarök is, of course, the bond between Kratos and Atreus. It speaks to emotionally constipated parents and frustrated kids, and for the most part, watching both of them grow up is appropriately maddening. The first third of the game can be grating if you’re not a fan of claustrophobic bickering and puberty-driven tantrums — I’m not talking about a taut, bristling sense of dramatic tension, but a lot of whining and grunting. But this also creates an immediate sense of relief whenever Kratos and Atreus split up to do their own thing; Atreus finally gets to be his own person on his detours to other realms, where he finally meets other kids his own age and embraces his own identity. The game, for the most part, does a good job of letting Kratos’ horrendously repressed emotions bubble to the surface. Over time, it also does well at untethering an extremely codependent familial relationship, which I can relate to as the kid of a single parent.Further into the story, it becomes crystal clear that the writers drank deeply from the well of The Great Sopranos Renaissance during the pandemic. There are all-too-familiar echoes of a made man getting pulled back into an old role, the moody scion who makes reckless decisions, the ritualistic sit-downs and mob negotiations that trigger inevitable conflict, and the overriding need for everyone to go to therapy. In ancient mythology, mob drama isn’t too far off from how gods behaved — unbridled pettiness, strict adherence to duty, maudlin displays of spite, and plenty of disguises and scams. And at the heart of it all, of course: family. Odin is a cross between Woody Allen and a neurotic Guy Ritchie mob boss, which I’m sure will appeal to some folks, but after 35 hours, I’m not one of them. It’s true that God of War’s characters (mostly Brok and Sindri) already established this anachronistic “what if ancient beings followed modern stereotypes” style, but Ragnarök seizes this approach by the neck and dials it up to 11. The result is more of an assault than an accentuation. Like all art and entertainment, games reflect the cultural contexts and trends surrounding their development, and when there’s big money involved, it means, more often than not, following a path that has already proved effective for the bottom line. Besides the Sopranos-like undercurrents, Ragnarök also channels toned-down antihero qualities of The Boys, spatters of aspirational Tarantino dialogue, and the frat pack era of filmmaking — the latter is evident in the character of Freyr, who, besides being a huge stoner, fails to show the blistering X-factor appeal that supposedly draws elves, dwarves, men, women, children, and stray dogs into his orbit. While some may delight at the banter when Thor shows up at Kratos’ house, it can feel a bit like eating reheated leftovers, albeit well-voiced ones. This isn’t a complaint about derivative media; all our stories are derivative. But how you do it matters — and when storytellers are generally too keen on remixing the hits without adding anything new, it means you have to work twice as hard to pull off a banger that still feels fresh and invigorating.Watching Odin godboss, gaslight, and gatekeep his way to Atreus’ heart is pleasantly sadistic revenge for the squabbles that came before. It is fleetingly comical to see the hypochondriac Sindri get sneezed on, and the game leans hard into the dysfunctional family dinner trope, where a humble dining table becomes the focal point for the story’s big “what now?” moments. On the other hand, characterizing Thor’s drinking like a modern-day affliction feels incredibly forced; it is simply a weird choice to bring contemporary concepts of accountability and Alcoholics Anonymous vibes to a mythological world of gods. Odin’s obsession with his own fate, too, feels poorly thought out. You can’t just shoehorn modern sensibilities into Valhalla — even with the goal of making the gods relatable and “human” — and expect all of it to fit well. “It’s me, your entire economy, speaking,” Odin yells at the dwarves, in another overwritten callback to his mob boss characterization.Despite its painful self-awareness about script structures, Ragnarök’s pacing is, at best, inconsistent. There’s a lot of filler and circular rambling — mostly on Atreus’ part — about what needs to be done to either avert or trigger Ragnarök. Atreus is also brimming with the sort of ceaseless questions that give parents gray hairs. On one hand, it does the trick: The characters are understandably anxious! But the constant hemming and hawing can get old, and in some instances, undercut the urgency and direness of the whole situation. NPCs will also routinely remind you to go blow off steam and do other things before continuing the main quest. But when the stakes are literally the end of the world and it’s already established that Odin has more eyes on you than a Ring doorbell, it doesn’t exactly make you want to run around and take in the scenery.

  Perhaps the problem lies with the frustrations of Ragnarök’s architecture as an “open-style” but non-open-world game. As in God of War, the main quest is essentially a series of tunnels pushing you toward an inevitable end. Many of these sections feel interminable, like the early portions of Svartalfheim and Vanaheim. What’s more, some realms feel like assignments rather than exciting new places — NPCs shouldn’t have to explicitly tell me to be thrilled about exploring a locale. For such an enormous world that clearly prides itself on its scale and wonder, there are times when my adventure felt like an amusement park ride (there’s a flume-boat section that looks and feels just like Big Thunder Mountain Railroad) where I just wanted to careen off the rails. Some of the mechanics, like Atreus’ chain-reaction Sigil arrows, feel like they belong in a different, more creatively permissive game that lets you actually experiment with the environments. Ragnarök constantly hints at deeper interlocking systems, but fails to follow through.Even so, Alfheim is by far the most captivating realm, possibly because there’s just so much to do, and also because the Temple of Light seems visually inspired by Singapore’s Gardens by the Bay (upon seeing the non-hive-encrusted Lake of Souls, I immediately thought of this local landmark). The temple is one of my favorite environments, next to the earthy reds and ochres of Jotunheim’s flora (and how it plays with size and scale), which had me peeking around corners for Elden Ring’s Malenia. Asgard, though, remains a wasted cipher — there isn’t much room to explore, even though a huge part of Atreus’ story arc involves going there to do just that.That being said, most of the side quests (known as Favors) are a lot more compelling than the main storyline, like Freya’s very personal mission to get closure from her forced marriage to Odin. I’ve always maintained that the real heart and soul of a game world can be found in side quests, if it has them, and Ragnarök is no different; there’s an especially engaging slow burn in the Vanaheim Crater area, where you get thrown a few crumbs about Kratos’ enigmatic late wife Laufey and her past. A fair amount of Favors involve cleaning up messes — again, back to the theme of accountability and making things right, or trying to leave something better than it was before.In a more welcome departure from God of War, Ragnarök also lets you experience, for limited periods, different combinations of characters working together. Atreus has extremely strong synergies with a new character who I won’t spoil here. And when a stronger, marginally wiser Atreus reunites with his father, it almost feels unfair to relegate him back to a sidekick role. But such is the power of the parental gaze — it makes sense to have Atreus inhibit himself around his father until dire circumstances call for dire actions. The big emotional gut punches in the story, when they do happen, do hurt (to be fair, I’m also someone who cries at cable television). The very last act of the game, where everything comes together and ties back to Kratos’ past and status as a god, felt like a bittersweet triumph for both father and son, and almost made up for all the times I wanted to knock their skulls together.For all of its flaws, there are moments in Ragnarök that well and truly rule. Mechanically speaking, the Aesir boss fights are all pretty much the same iterations of dodge, dip, duck, dive, and dodge — nothing to write home about, and more of a test of endurance and evasion than anything. But one boss fight, against Nidhogg, captured my heart. It’s metal as hell: a full technicolor blast of adrenaline and visual flourish and great monster design that I would replay in a heartbeat. There are also, to Ragnarök’s credit, a lot of very good dogs, and very purposefully weaponized uses of them.After dozens of hours watching Ragnarök’s characters struggle through a quasi-comical escalation of events — the kind of domino effect shitshow where one thing inadvertently sets off a chain reaction of mini-shitshows that nobody wanted to happen — it’s great to forget about fate and decorum, and simply feel content with the knowledge that everyone in this big, messy not-Marvel, not-Sopranos production experienced a promising modicum of character growth; at least enough to make it a better game than its predecessor. There is nothing life-changing about the way Ragnarök wraps up, but it delivers the same pleasant satisfaction that I get from finishing a Marvel movie that lets me run on autopilot. Even where the game can be frustrating, rote, and uneven, it’s also safe and comforting, like a rerun of Cheers where everyone knows your name and you know that you’ll never get thrown out of the bar. God of War Ragnarök, as the sum of its many disparate and often conflicting parts and influences, isn’t here to reinvent the wheel. But its single-minded desire to emulate all the hallmarks of an epic Hollywood narrative will remain both its biggest weakness and its enduring source of success. And like many, many Hollywood success stories, it shouldn’t feel this weird to say that something of this scope and scale is just OK. God of War Ragnarök will be released on Nov. 9 on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4. The game was reviewed on PS4 Pro using a pre-release download code provided by Sony Interactive Entertainment.

God of War Ragnarök,Zack Zwiezen,Kotaku,https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-release-date-ps4-ps5-spear-1849734382,"Literally, nothing anyone can say will dissuade a certain set of PlayStation fans from playing God of War Ragnarök, the latest major Sony exclusive starring Kratos, the god killer himself. After years of waiting, the hype for this highly anticipated sequel has exploded beyond control. And while I have a few qualms, I’m here to report that, yes, Ragnarök is very good and will likely satisfy folks who loved 2018’s God of War and want to experience further adventure with Kratos and his boy. God of War Ragnarök, out November 9 on PS4 and PS5, is the follow-up to 2018’s soft franchise reboot, which moved Kratos from the land of Greek gods to the world of Norse mythology. It also aged him up, gave him a young son to care for, and tasked the two of them with spreading the ashes of Faye, Kratos’ wife and Atreus’ mother. (Spoiler warning: If you didn’t finish 2018’s God of War and care about what happens, skip the next paragraph.)That seemingly simple task led the two on a large-scale adventure involving gods and monsters, and helped the pair grow closer. Unfortunately, they also invoked the ire of Odin’s former wife, Freya, by slaying her son Baldur. And Baldur’s death triggered Fimbulwinter, a three-year season of ice said to precede the world-ending conflict known as Ragnarök. Meanwhile Atreus learned he’s half-giant—known as Loki to his mother’s people—and Kratos discovered a mural depicting his death. Fun times!All of those story threads continue in God of War Ragnarök, which quickly establishes that Fimbulwinter is nearly over—meaning the world will end soon via Ragnarök—and that the now-older Atreus has been sneaking out to look for clues about his giant lineage and to possibly discover a way to prevent the cataclysm. Odin takes note, eventually forcing Kratos, Atreus, and friends to work together to foil the god’s scheming, save the world, and hopefully change fate to prevent Kratos’ demise.Big epic stuff! But don’t worry, unlike other folks online lately, I won’t spoil any of what actually happens. That in mind, what surprises me most is that while the overall narrative is extremely large-scale and epic, the game spends most of its time focused on the relationship between Kratos, Atreus, and their friends.Sure, Ragnarök is coming and Odin—one of the most powerful gods in all the nine realms—is trying to save his own skin, but that’s not really what this game is about. The greater focus is on Kratos and Atreus. The young boy isn’t a young boy anymore and he wants to live his own life and become his own man. Kratos isn’t dealing with that very well, falling back to his old ways to protect and control Atreus. This leads to tension, a lack of trust, and some tough moments. Their relationship is the heart of the game, and even when I’d sigh upon encountering yet another door puzzle, I’d push forward because I wanted to see what happened next.Like its predecessor, Ragnarök is a third-person action-adventure; that means a lot of fights, and I mean a lot! Luckily, the killin’ is good, with combat feeling both heavy and responsive. Each swing of your axe or slice of your blades looks nice, sounds powerful, and feels satisfying. This time around you start out with both the awesome ice axe and the fiery Blades of Chaos. This also means combat is a bit trickier from the start, with more complex engagements forcing you to switch up your weapons to counter different enemy types sooner. Eventually, you acquire a third weapon, a magical spear, that fits perfectly into the combat toolbox, but which I won’t spoil beyond that.The big difference this time around is that you don’t only fight nasties as Kratos, but also as his son. While you could give Atreus commands in the previous game, this time around you get to actually play as him as he goes on his own adventures—sometimes without his dad knowing. These Atreus segments help shake things up and keep the combat from getting too stale, as the young son is much more range-focused with his bow and magic. These sequences also give Atreus more time to develop into someone beyond that kid Kratos called “Boy” all the time.One particular extended Atreus segment around the game’s midpoint is one of my favorite parts from all of Ragnarök. Impressive stuff. While it might upset some fans, I’m happy Sony Santa Monica was confident enough to sideline Kratos at times to give his son more focus. The Arbiter levels in Halo 2 were a horrible mistake, but here the hero swap works and helps make Atreus a fully-formed character beyond just “the son of Kratos.” And more than just a minor detour, Atreus has his own weapons, skills, and abilities you can upgrade and tweak throughout the game.Ironically, that also adds to one of my biggest problems with Ragnarök: too much menu fiddling.I can’t stress enough how irritating I find all of Ragnarök’s various armor, weapon, and ability menus. Every few hours during my 35-hour playthrough the game added more stuff to manage and tinker with. You can upgrade every piece of armor and equipment. Some weapons and armor have to be crafted with a combination of two or three of the game’s dozens of crafting materials and currencies. You can also equip abilities and runes, and guess what, you can upgrade those, too. You also have to manage multiple skill trees, each of which contains skills that you can (yep!) tweak and upgrade.Eventually, I acquired an amulet that had a dozen slots I could fill with various combinations of gems, and I sighed. I can’t imagine Kratos would actually want or care about all this stuff. I know I don’t. While I assume some players will get a kick out of min-maxing all the stats and skills; creating specific builds and whatnot, I just got tired of it all. I’m here to rip enemies in half and toss around a big ol’ axe, not to balance my taxes via seven different menus. Thankfully, if you just pick two stats and upgrade everything around those, you can mostly ignore all the fluff and still end up a powerful god-killer.While at times God of War Ragnarök can feel more like a big DLC than a full sequel, it also tries to expand on the formula of the first game. One example of this can be found in some of the big, open-world-ish locations where you’re free to explore and complete side-quests and objectives in whatever order you choose. These segments remind me a lot of the similar moments in Uncharted 4 and Gears 5. Like those games, Ragnarök doesn’t go full open world, but instead uses these larger areas to experiment a bit.""You’ll laugh! You’ll cry! You’ll punch 200 chests and complete 100 door puzzles!""Epic, third-person melee-focused action-adventure RPG featuring a very angry dadFantastic combat, gorgeous visuals, solid writing, 120fps option, satisfying endingToo much fiddling with skills and upgrades, a few too many puzzles, slow openingSanta Monica StudioPS4, PS5 (Played) November 9, 2022Just about 40 hours. Completed main campaign and most side-quests.These freeform segments will likely be controversial. I liked how they slowed things down and let the characters talk more as I explored for collectibles and upgrade materials, but I imagine some players will find these areas too big and empty, devoid of action or fun. The one thing I believe everyone will agree on is that these sequences, like the rest of the game, are filled with puzzles. Perhaps…too many?Some of Ragnarök’s puzzles can be amusing to figure out, striking that perfect balance between being hard enough that you feel smart solving them and easy enough that they don’t become roadblocks to progress. But far too many of the puzzles end up feeling like busywork, just a way to slow you down over and over. And frustratingly, one mechanic involving triggering magic arrows with elements is far too finicky, often not working when it should. It’s a bummer that the second half of Ragnarök has so many of these puzzles, which sort of ruins a lot of the later side dungeons and puzzle rooms.Beyond the annoying puzzles and fantastic combat encounters, I was really struck by how often Ragnarök just lets things breathe. The game is filled with quiet moments, some of which can go on for as long as you want. One standout involves Atreus, Kratos, Mimir, the blacksmiths, and a few others all gathered around a small table and eating a meal together in awkward silence. The game just lets you sit there for as long as you want as characters fidget about and try to make small talk. Another involved Atreus skipping stones on a river. Again, you can skip this moment or stick around and listen to characters talk, tell stories, or share their feelings with you.That’s not to say God of War Ragnarök is a quiet game. It’s a visually impressive and exciting adventure that, at least on PS5, runs at 120fps and is filled with gore, action, and intense moments of destruction. But it also never forgets the real focus should always be on its characters. Kratos and Atreus are the heart of this new era of God of War. Ragnarök provides them plenty of quiet moments and lets you see just how much they’ve grown and developed since 2018. Getting to see the journey they take together to reach this new point in their lives is truly my favorite part of this sequel.Yes, the axe is cool. Sure, the fights are tons of fun. And I definitely enjoyed exploring every nook and cranny of the large worlds you get to visit. But what kept me glued to my PS5 for nearly 40 hours was the story of a son becoming a man and a father trying to figure out how he feels about that. I probably could have enjoyed this story a tad more with about half as many puzzles and skill menus, but even so, I found myself smiling, feeling satisfied, as the credits rolled. As I said at the start, God of War Ragnarök is very good.  "
God of War Ragnarök,Chris Carter,Destructoid,https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-god-of-war-ragnarok-ps5/,"darkI typically start off some AAA sequel reviews waxing poetic about how “there isn’t much to say that wasn’t already said” about an original. But in the case of 2018’s God of War, there really is!It’s fascinating that the team kept the original continuity, but drastically changed the formula, and let Kratos grow as a character and a father. The pointed focus on the relationship between Kratos and Atreus helped make the 2018 iteration intimate and relatable. The sequel, God of War Ragnarok, mostly rolls with that premise, but it also tries to juggle a ton of extra cast members as it weaves in more stories.God of War Ragnarok (PS4, PS5 [reviewed])
Developer: Santa Monica Studio
Publisher: Sony
Released: November 9, 2022
MSRP: $69.99 (PS5) / $59.99 (PS4)For me, God of War really snuck up on me. I mean, we knew about it! Sony sounded their marketing trumpets from the mountaintop for this game. But playing it in isolation as a huge classic God of War fan (particularly God of War 2), I was shocked to see the direction that the team had taken with it: making Kratos a husband and a father, struggling with his violent past. I was invested in the universe out of the gate, and there’s more than enough good will there to entice me to try a sequel.Ragnarok continues the adventures of Kratos and Atreus (who is playable at points, complete with his own mini-loadout and skill trees), who are prepping for the titular potentially world-ending event, directly following the conclusion of God of War 2018. Even though you’ll miss some emotional resonance and some relationship/dialogue nuances, there is a God of War recap that you can watch from the start.Kicking off with a low key hutting expedition, Ragnarok doesn’t really waste much time. If I could describe the pacing of the story as a whole, it would be moments of urgency bundled with periods of calm. There’s a ton of walking and talking and exposition, which is kind of required given the larger scope and universe-sensitive stakes. You’re still traveling between realms this time, and it quickly becomes a road movie.Kratos is already a tad more fatherly, but still cold with room to grow. Atreus is older and more capable, but still compassionate, and a direct opposite of his dad in some ways, while still being a chip off the old block. Mimir (the talking head companion you rescued in the first game) is also in the mix, and is as entertaining and loud-mouthed as ever. Some of the most intriguing bits of Ragnarok are found in the arcs dealing with Kratos and Atreus: either together or apart. There’s some backstory that the team held from the 2018 edition spliced in, amid all of the new stuff happening.Combat, a big reason why people gravitate toward this franchise in the first place, is mostly the same: which works for me. There’s a dodge, parry and block system on the defensive side, which can be plussed-up through various means like skill trees, to create even more engaging timing sequences. You’ll mostly be using your [Leviathan] axe and blades [of Chaos], with a third main weapon that I won’t spoil here.One of the big upgrades for the first two weapon types in particular though is the ice and fire synergy. The icy axe and fiery blades can be charged up with the Triangle button, to imbue elemental powers in them and open up more attacks. Like several other action games before it (including DmC even), you can chip off shields of the opposite type on some enemy types.At first, I was worried that the team would go overboard with this system, and have the entire game based around the “opposites” approach. Thankfully that’s not the case, and you don’t even really need to use all of the tools in your toolkit to be successful. There’s so many options to approach any given fight, and you can tech into certain playstyles with skill tree and gear changes.Combat is still really punchy, and can often feel like a dance. I never really got tired of throwing an axe into one enemy to freeze it, then turning to beat up another one, then recalling the axe to finish them off. Although a lot has changed about this series combat is still brutal; with some vicious takedowns (triggered by R3 after an enemy is nearly dead) on full display. While I’m not going to spoil any boss fights, a select few are cemented among my favorites in the series (including a callback to the Narcis Prince archetype).Like the first game, sidequests are often directly tied to the story and the cast, usually after you acclimate to a new zone: without overdoing it and adding a ton of annoying pins to each disconnected sandbox. The main quest is roughly 20 hours (a little more with exploration), and all the sidequests, the leveling/gear system, and a few extras after completion will potentially double that number.Mechanically, it’s easy to tweak things to your liking too, to assist on that long ride. There’s tons of accessibility presets, including vision, hearing, motion, and motor toggles: on top of five difficulties (the last of which (Give Me God of War) can’t be reselected if you drop down. There’s options for a variety of experiences, and it’s one of the most accessible games ever made.Of course, a soft reset is kind of hand-waved away through fleeting mentions of stuff like the extreme winter “wearing down” some of Kratos’ powers, and the fact that Kratos “used” all of the armor provided to him from the blacksmiths Brok and Sindri (who return in the sequel as companions and helpers, albeit with a bit more depth).The father and son dynamic is still an emotional throughline, with Mimir sometimes acting as the reasonable impartial uncle. It’s still hilarious to see Kratos as the straight act to goofier or lighter fare, and there’s some really funny dialogue this time around that leans into that angle. The new additions are fantastic for the most part, as Ryan Hurst is incredible as a tortured Thor, and Richard Schiff really gets to spread his wings as the complicated Odin.And don’t forget the banter! There’s so much dialogue and lore to take in it’s insane at times. It can even reach the cusp of becoming exhausting, as a minor walk to a quest could end up becoming a crucial lore dump. Everyone who found themselves poring over this new universe will be stoked.Before too long though, we get a ton of characters thrown at us, some of which leave a more lasting impact than others. At times, especially mid-to-late game, I felt like this could have actually been a trilogy all on its own, with a little more time to linger on some of the events and moments therein. That same sense of overstaying a welcome can extend to the enemy types in Ragnarok: some of which are plucked from the original game, which the same basic strategic concepts.It can lead to more downtime, which may or may not gel with how you interact with a God of War game. I appreciated the streamlined and constant growth of Kratos and Atreus’ relationship in the first game, but the sequel has a lot of moving parts, and I didn’t connect with all of its cast.God of War Ragnarok is a fantastic showcase of what this series has to offer, and a sterling example of how it still has life left in it. While not everything lands with the sequel from a story perspective, the core of the original is preserved, with some new twists and turns still to go. I’m fully on board with whatever Sony Santa Monica comes up with next.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]SuperbA hallmark of excellence. There may be flaws, but they are negligible and won't cause massive damage.

Jason Faulkner 
God of War (2018) is a tough act to follow. It got the highest possible scores from tons of publications (including us) and has sold over 23 million copies. We called it a “console-defining” game for the PS4. So, needless to say, there are big expectations for God of War Ragnarök.Fortunately, Ragnarök manages to meet and even exceed the hype for the most part. It’s bigger, bolder, and packed with more adventure than its predecessor. Unfortunately, a lackluster final act means it falls a little short of perfection.God of War Ragnarök starts three years after the previous game’s ending. Baldur’s death marked the beginning of Fimbulwinter, in which snow and blizzards engulfed all of Midgard. Because of this, Tyr’s Temple and the Lake of Nine have become an icy wasteland, making realm travel impossible.In the three years since Atreus and Kratos returned from Jotenheim, they’ve been training. Still mad with the desire for vengeance, Freya continues to hound them, but Faye’s protective barrier keeps her at bay.The two have tried to figure out a way to prevent Ragnarök and stop the destruction of all the realms except Asgard. Unfortunately, since the two have been stuck in Midgard, they have yet to make much progress. However, it comes to light that Atreus has been sneaking out of the protective barrier and has found an alternate prophecy that predicts an outcome exactly the opposite of what the original states. In it, the realms unite against Aesir during Ragnarök, defeat Odin, and destroy Asgard.The catch is that at the end of the last game, there was a mural amongst the giant prophecies that said Kratos would die during Ragnarök. So, the big dilemma throughout the game is whether to prevent Ragnarök and keep the status quo, which potentially would save Kratos, or risk it all and try to ensure Asgard falls.A recurring theme throughout the game is whether the characters’ fates are predetermined. The giants left behind many prophecies, all of which seem to come to pass despite the group’s best efforts to stop them. So, could they stop Ragnarök if they wanted to? Or are they locked into a course of action they can’t change despite knowing what the future holds.?In the background is Kratos’s struggle to let Atreus be his own person. In the three years that have passed, Atreus has grown into a young man. It’s a hard transition for Kratos, who has only barely grasped the role of fathering a boy, to now look at him as a man.The story is suitably epic, as you might expect from a game about Ragnarök. The cast is much expanded from the last part of the journey, and you’ll meet many people and see many sights that were only hinted at before. For example, Svartalfheim, home of the Dwarves, gives us our first glance at (an existing) civilization and lets us know what’s at stake if Ragnarök proceeds as prophesized.Playing straight through with no detours will take you around 20-25 hours. However, it felt much longer (in a good way) because of how much territory you cover. This time around, you’ll visit all nine realms, and the game’s scope is much greater.Despite the larger amount of territory, the pacing is excellent for most of the game. However, Santa Monica Studio’s desire to end the Norse storyline with Ragnarök resulted in the last bit feeling rushed. A few plot points, which are discussed multiple times throughout the game, end up being glossed over or dropped completely without explanation. Given how dense the game already is, it wouldn’t have been a reach to make it the second part of a trilogy.Regardless, with God of War Ragnarök, it’s more about the journey than the destination. But, of course, when you have a cast of beloved characters, any ending will be bittersweet. So even though it didn’t quite stick the landing, it’s an immensely satisfying adventure overall.Like in the previous game, there’s an ebb and flow between story missions and exploration. Again, the main quest is relatively linear, but there are many more side quests and optional content this time.God of War’s open-world gameplay primarily centered around the area around Tyr’s Temple and a few smaller areas in other realms. On the other hand, Ragnarök has large open spaces in several realms that you unlock over the course of the game.There’s a lot more environmental variety as well. As much as I love the Lake of Nine and paddling around in a boat, it was great to take a different mode of transportation for a change. The deserts of Alfheim, verdant forrests of Vanaheim, and snowy drifts of Midgard are amongst the places you can seek out knowledge and treasure. Each of them contrasts with the other not only in color palette but also in enemy type. Each realm consists of a different biome, and you’ll run into unique enemies, obstacles, and endemic life in each of them.The side quests are worth taking on for the lore alone, which is greatly expanded. Even the collectibles are woven into a tale or one of the character’s personal stories. So, even if you’re throwing your ax at 48 spectral crows, it feels like you’re doing something that affects the world instead of just ticking a number upward.Unfortunately, since it’s a cross-generation title, Ragnarök doesn’t entirely take full advantage of the PS5’s power. There are still plenty of places you have to slowly climb a cliff or travel through a long tunnel so the PS4 has time to load the next area. I hope we’ll see that trend die off soon because it’s started to wear as thin as regular loading screens at this point.Combat in God of War Ragnarök only gets a slight overhaul. Kratos plays the same for the most part, aside from superficial changes. He does get some new combat options later in the game, but if you pick up the controller straight from God of War (2018), you’ll feel right at home.One thing I’m not fond of is the removal of the shield skill tree. While you can still parry and shield bash, it’s missing most of the moves that made it a stun combo monster in the previous game.Elemental attacks are more important this time around. Holding triangle will charge a weapon with its signature move, imbuing it with elemental power. Some enemies have an elemental weakness by default. In contrast, others can generate elemental shields to protect against a particular type of damage.The combat is still fun, and it’s a blast to rack up a big combo while switching between weapons. It continues to rely heavily on juggling, timing, and stunning, which gives it a bit of a fighting game feel.There’s more to say about the combat system, but some aspects of it are unlocked via story events. So, instead of spoiling the fun, I’ll wrap it up by saying the fighting in this game is more of an evolution of the previous title than a reimagining. However, there are more options for defeating your foes overall.God of War Ragnarök is a triumph. It’s a swansong for the PS4 and one of the best first-party games for the PS5 so far. It’s bigger than its predecessor in every way.The game’s only flaw is the weak climax. Everything up to that part is gold. However, it’s hard to find a conclusion that’ll satisfy everyone when the stakes are basically everything.9Jason Faulkner is the Senior Editor of Game Revolution and PlayStation LifeStyle.

God of War Ragnarök,Paul Tassi,Forbes,https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2022/11/03/god-of-war-ragnarok-reviewlightning-strikes-twice/?sh=19daf1f2ff4c,"God of War RagnarokGod of War Ragnarok is not a wholly transformational entry for the series the way its predecessor was. It couldn’t be, at least not in the same way.The leap from the original God of War games to an entirely new format with the release of the blockbuster reimagining in 2018 was something that would be impossible to replicate exactly. So, Ragnarok will just have to be content being an exceptional sequel to arguably one of the best games of last generation. And that should be good enough for everyone.This ain’t “DLC,” a common critique leveled at Ragnarok by some in early previews, citing similar zones and animations. This is every bit as sprawling and massive a game as the original, even if of course the first game lends it some old realms and flying Leviathan axe maneuvers. My normal “Give Me Balance” difficulty playthrough lasted just over 30 hours, which included exploring a good amount rather than mainlining the central story. But having saved some sidequests, optional bosses and challenges to the end, I finished nearly everything by 37 hours or so. A hundred precenting the game would take a few more than that (so many damn Odin ravens to find), and all of this would take much, much longer on higher difficulties with a lot more failures in combat.There is little God of War Ragnarok fails at, period. Everything you liked about the first game is here, again, but with enough added to it in order to warrant the length and depth of a sequel. The “Dad and Boy” dynamic is still in place, though this time it’s a teenage Atreus leading the central quest as he tries to discover his destiny. Now it’s Kratos following Boy, not Boy following Kratos. And he rarely calls him “Boy” anymore, with a major theme being Kratos trying, and often failing, to trust his nearly grown son with their fates.Fimbulwinter has warped the realms, freezing Midguard in ice, creating blowing sandstorms and poison swamps in other regions. Meanwhile, a vengeful Freya is still out for justice after the deadly final moments of the last game. But as we know, the Big Bad here is her ex-husband, Odin, and his Large Son, Thor, acting as bodyguard and enforcer. An extremely early battle against Kratos will show you just how well-matched the two legends are in open combat.God of War RagnarokBut if the last game wasn’t a clue, this is not the original God of War series. The story is not necessarily going to be Kratos racing around to kill every god in the pantheon in increasingly brutal ways. And the way the game develops Kratos and Atreus’s rivalries/relationships with Freya, Odin, Thor and other, unnamed characters I won’t reveal here, is easily one of its most compelling aspects. Sure, there are still plenty of touching parenthood moments to be found here between Kratos and Atreus, just like the last game, but if Ragnarok improves on God of War in one significant way, it’s how it utilizes the entire cast to enormous affect here, new characters, but also old ones. The standouts of the bunch by the end are Freya, and the dwarven duo Brok and Sindri, believe it or not, who are given, far, far more to do this time around than upgrade your gear (though they also do that).If there’s one area where the game’s story suffers, it’s not the writing or performances, which are all stellar, it’s the pacing. While I enjoyed meeting Thor and Odin, I kept track, and it was seventeen hours until I saw them again in the story. Sure, some of that was me wandering off to explore, but it still felt like a lot. Similarly, there are a few story segments that really, really drag, like a casual bit of adventuring in a relatively placid realm hidden from Odin that lasts probably two hours longer than it needs to.Level pacing itself can be weird too. The environments are sometimes overly linear and oppressively claustrophobic. There are some very cool, quasi-open world spaces to explore, but a lot of it is narrow hallways with similar-feeling puzzles and the all-too-present “shimmy through the tight space” mechanic that is wildly overused.But most of the areas are gorgeous, fun to play through and engaging, especially the further you get into the game where you will start to design some areas specifically designed for “choose your own adventure” exploration. And another area where God of War Ragnarok shines is its combat, above and beyond even its predecessor.I cannot speak highly enough about how much I enjoyed fighting in Ragnarok here. There are way, way more build options this time around, tons of armor sets, weapon mods, shield mods and companion mods, in addition to interchangeable abilities and a skill tree that upgrades individual skills the more you use them, both rewarding your favored playstyle and encouraging diversity in tactics while fighting. With plentiful upgrade materials to max out a number of sets and playstyles by the end, I had a blast putting some of these builds together. My all-time favorite was an armor set that allowed me to poison enemies when beating them with my bare fists, and then after that, they took 40% more melee damage while poisoned. Combine that with a rune skill ability that dramatically slows time and more mods to increase melee damage while time is slowed, and I was tearing up enemies and bosses alike.God of War RagnarokIn terms of the difficulty of combat, like the first game, it’s a wide range. Normal story stuff is not going to be terribly hard for the most part, at least on a standard difficulty. But yes, there is another Valkyrie-equivalent miniboss challenge spread across the game (not literal Valkyries again, don’t worry, they didn’t recycle all of them), with a mega-tough final boss I have yet to beat. Two mega-tough final bosses, in fact, this time, but that’s all I’ll say. Other than to note that I really enjoyed the ending of the game, both narratively, and in terms of the post-credits gameplay pathways it offered to keep doing things in the world. Even though yes, you will finish it all eventually. This is not God of War-as-service.God of War Ragnarok is a beautiful, moving game, no longer purely centered on a father getting to know his son, but also about vengeance, forgiveness and attempting to change both prophecy, and the people we used to be, both of which prove to be equally difficult. It’s almost impossible for me to imagine those who loved the last God of War will not also appreciate this one just as much, minus a lagging stretch here or there, and the fact that it can’t be as transformative as the initial leap from the Greek games.I have many, many questions about what comes next for this series, but I will save that for another day, in addition to a deeper discussion of some new mechanics and additions that may be considered spoilers, so I didn’t mention them here.

Login NowAs the finale in the Norse saga, God of War Ragnarok is the perfect conclusion to Kratos and Atreus' adventure.God of War Ragnarok is a masterpiece. The team at Santa Monica Studio has somehow managed to take what the 2018 game started, lift the story to dizzying new heights, refresh the combat systems, and tie it all off with enough emotional impact that it has left me thinking about the ending for days.The story of God of War Ragnarok picks up a few years after the events of the first game. The previous actions of Kratos and Atreus have ushered in Fimbulwinter, dramatically altering the climate of the nine realms.In his tireless drive to be prepared, Kratos has been training Atreus over these past years in anticipation for what comes next, whether it’s Ragnarok or something else. Throughout this time, Atreus has grown from a child into a young man with his sights set on finding answers.After a brief encounter, and a proposition, Kratos, Atreus, and Mimir set off on their next adventure as the prophecy of Ragnarok looms overhead.Told through its iconic seamless transitions, the tale of God of War Ragnarok manages to be both grand and awe-inspiring but also genuine and personal. It’s touching to watch Kratos continue to try and guide Atreus along the path he thinks is right, all while Atreus wrestles with the pursuit of independence that every teenager seeks.The narrative does wonders to expertly sidestep the common trope of moody and unlikable teenagers. Atreus often psyches himself up before a talk by having solo conversations where he plays both sides. He’ll offer up his own wishes and then imagine the retorts his father would make. It’s a genuine moment that reminded me of my own youth, practicing an idea before taking it to my parents.These emotional and relatable moments are sprinkled all throughout the story. Despite its fantastical setting and its grandiose worldbuilding, the characters, relationships, and themes are all grounded. It’s impossible not to be drawn into Kratos’ single dad struggles, Atreus’ lack of agency and desire to learn who he is, or the myriad of other characters and their plights.More than once throughout this unforgettable narrative I found myself welling up with emotion. The way the writers continue to develop and grow these characters is commendable. But it wasn’t just tears I was shedding, I was also hooting and hollering with excitement or laughing at the comedic timing.While the writing is impeccable, what lifts the narrative further are the performances. Christopher Judge as Kratos and Sunny Suljic as Atreus come together to create some of the most emotionally raw scenes in a video game to date. I would stare, misty-eyed, watching the character’s expressions, feeling the weight of the scene and all the emotional undertones being delivered by the actors. In addition to Judge and Suljic, Ryan Hurst as Thor, Richard Schiff as Odin, and Danielle Bisutti as Freya offered some spine-tingling and soul-crushing performances.To put it plainly, the whole story of God of War Ragnarok feels like an epic. It feels like one of the mighty tales that the characters talk about while you're playing. It’s mythological, grand, and world-changing but it’s also incredibly personal and genuine. It’s a gripping journey from start to finish and an absolute master class in storytelling.God of War Ragnarok’s excellence flows from its narrative into its gameplay. While the combat remains similar to the first, it’s been expanded with additional options and mechanics for Kratos and Atreus. It’s just different enough to feel refreshing without drifting too far from what was on offer in the first, in fact, it feels like a refinement.Kratos can still impale his foes with the Blades of Chaos to either pull them to him or send a fiery blast down the chain. These skills now exist as two unique moves attached to different buttons and each boast powerful upgrades. The changes to each weapon’s systems are subtle and overall improve the formula.Beyond the moves, players will find new Runic attacks to use, additional relics (Ragnarok’s form of the talisman), as well as a retooling of the enchantment system. Armor comes with unique effects and set bonuses, allowing players to really lean into a certain playstyle. I switched between a couple of sets, one that increased my base damage for a short time after using a Runic attack and another that increased the drop chance of health gems.Weaving these all together allows Kratos and Atreus to feel like a powerhouse throughout the campaign. This is heightened thanks to the soundtrack which is of mythological proportions. As Kratos swings his axe and carves up foes, the music swells and crashes. During intense quick-time cutscenes the orchestral score explodes to the beat of Kratos’ fists. Everything about the combat and music leaves you feeling like the god that you are.The power fantasiy is so good that I was concerned I wouldn’t have an opportunity to flex my power and test my mettle in difficult boss fights at the end of the story. Thankfully, Ragnarok has its own sort of Valkyrie-like encounters to keep you busy. These are a brutal challenge and exactly what the game needs to keep players tweaking their builds and collecting resources to upgrade their gear.God of War Ragnarok is not a strictly an open world game. Like the first, there are realms to visit and explore, each with its own unique environments, side quests, collectibles, as well as Nornir chests with their light puzzle mechanics. The puzzles also have their own separate setting in the expansive accessibility menu, giving players more time or slowing down objects to make them more forgiving.Players will be running, climbing, or using the Blades of Chaos on set points to swing between ledges when exploring the realms. There is a new addition in the form of a sled pulled by two wolves that allows Kratos and Atreus to move around the snow-covered realm of Midgard with ease. In the warmer environments the canoe returns, and although it’s a bit cumbersome to use, it offers an opportunity to hear Mimir’s stories and soak up the gorgeous vistas.Part of the joy of exploring these realms is who you get to explore them with. Without revealing too much, while Kratos, Atreus, and Mimir are the core trio, there are opportunities to fight alongside other characters in God of War Ragnarok. While their input to the combat is similar to one another, it affords the player a chance to learn more about these characters and see how they all interact outside of cutscenes. Again, it’s a small change from the first game but one that highlights the attention to detail Santa Monica Studio brings to the table, knowing just what to add to make an already stellar experience an exceptional one.Santa Monica Studio has captured lightning in a bottle for a second time. God of War Ragnarok left me speechless; it’s such a beautiful game both visually and narratively. The team has somehow managed to take what made the original such a wonder and expand upon it, delivering to players a masterpiece, an experience that sits atop the God of War pantheon.This review is based on a PlayStation 5 code provided by the publisher.

					Sam Chandler posted a new article, God of War Ragnarok review: Fit for Folkvangr 
					95 on Metacritic currently.  MY BODY IS READY				
					So, so good!				
					Sweeeeet 				
					High praise here about the side questshttps://twitter.com/genepark/status/1588200002354302978 
					I've played about 20 mins of the current GoW. Should I pick this up for ps5? I hate games on rails, so I'm hoping this isn't that?				
					Finish that thing it’s good, you have barely seen anything 				
					The intro bit is on-rails, and then you get to a central hub (you will absolutely know it when you get there) and becomes a self-directed open world with lots to do, and which evolves over the course of the story. I just finished up my second playthrough (PC version) to prep for Ragnarok, and goddamn it's still a masterpiece.				
					There's no reason to play this if you don't enjoy the previous entry. I'd give that more of a shot, and if you like it, buy this six months later once you're ready for the same type of ride again.				
					I just didn’t have time to play, but will have time when this launches.				
					Given the fact that the emotional core is built on the relationships from the first game, I'd definitely recommend starting there rather than skipping it. I can totally understand the time constraints.				
					New one comes with a recap video, so you decide 				
					While neat, the video recap doesn't really do the first game's story justice. It's definitely better to finish the first and then play Ragnarok.				
					Can I buy the PS5 edition to play on PS4? Ultimately I’d like to get a PS5 eventually but no need yet. 				
https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/god-of-war-ragnarok/I guess this one does both if I swap back and forth. Not sure about the disc one though. 				
					Digital?  Yes (get the $70 standard edition which includes both the PS4 and PS5 versions of the game). Physical?  No, the PS5 disc won't work on PS4.  The PS4 disc will allow you to play the PS4 version on either a PS4 or PS5, or pay the $10 upgrade fee for the PS5 version. 
					Thanks. Looks like I can also buy the $60 PS4 digital then pay $10 later if I want to upgrade... hmm				
					Yeah, that should be an option too.				"

In Ragnarök, the young and eager Atreus of the last God of War has been replaced with a headstrong pre-teen who is constantly pushing against his father’s headstrong attitude. As the title implies, father and son find themselves struggling through the realm-scarring Fimbulwinter, a prelude to the world-ending battle of Ragnarök.Yet even the prospect of the end of the world isn't enough to re-ignite Kratos' lust for war. He's eager to avoid the battle, seeing that as the best way to fulfill his monomaniacal desire to protect his son at all costs. Atreus, meanwhile, sees his dad as too cautious and struggles to convince Kratos to trust his more active (and risky) plans to avoid an outcome that is literally fated.Ragnarök’s writing and characterization push very hard in an attempt to achieve the same kind of heartstring-tugging moments of growth and understanding between Kratos and Atreus that the last game achieved effortlessly. Unfortunately, for the most part, these moments don’t land as well as they did in the last game.Part of the problem is the performances: Kratos and Atreus have some of the weakest and least effective line deliveries in a game that is full of strong voice acting and motion capture. As a result, I never fully bought the pre-teen angst that leads Atreus to explode in a surprising (and momentous) burst of defiance at a key point in the middle of the narrative. Kratos’ near-constant defensive crouch at the thought of his son being in danger, meanwhile, is much less interesting and affecting than his growth into a reluctant but caring father from the last game (and often seems in direct opposition to all the battling he does in between cutscenes).Another problem is the game's lack of narrative focus. While Kratos and Atreus are still central to this story, Ragnarök diverts its attention constantly to narrative interludes based on the small, reluctant band of allies that has formed around this core pair. Aside from distracting from the parental-and-child tale that could serve as the game’s emotional core, these digressions end up more than a bit uneven.The game puts a lot of effort into a heavily telegraphed “redemption” arc for Freya, for instance. The goddess’ transition from murderous rage after Kratos killed her son to a reluctant partnership doesn’t have much in the way of believable justification and ends up feeling unearned. I also found myself utterly unable to get interested in the overwrought backstory of the two dwarven brothers who serve as the resident blacksmiths for the crew.I was a bit more intrigued by Tyr, another former god of war who suffered a long confinement under Odin and, like Kratos, has renounced violence as a way of life. Unlike Kratos, though, Tyr does his best to stick with his newfound pacifism, offering a compelling and tortured take on whether an immortal force can really change its nature. And while Atreus’ interactions with his father didn’t really connect emotionally, extended sections where he pairs with various young female companions shine bright, full of the kind of flirtatious banter and emotional upheaval that can characterize youth.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

God of War Ragnarök,James Billcliffe,VG247,https://www.vg247.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-review,"What did we think of Kratos and Atreus' latest adventure? Find out in our God of War Ragnarok review!
It says everything you need to know about God of War Ragnarok that you can go from listening to the captivating tales of Norse mythology, as told by your best mates as you float gently past dense riverbanks of lush jungle and along placid lakes surrounded by snow-capped mountains, to squishing giant flying eyeballs with your bare hands in the space of about 90 seconds. 

Neither feel out of place or jarring, but the flying eyeballs probably disagree.

Although it starts out remarkably similar to the 2018 God of War both mechanically and graphically, God of War Ragnarok gradually builds into a meaningful evolution for the series, expanding the scope of gameplay both stealthily and overtly, while delivering a tense and twisty story that bends legend around its characters in exciting and endlessly interesting ways. 

God of War Ragnarok takes place across all nine realms of Norse cosmology, as Odin – king and all-father of the Aesir gods – moves literal heaven and earth to try and avert the doomsday that’s prophesied to bring about his destruction. At the end of the last game, Kratos and Atreus learned their unwitting part in the prophecy, and God of War Ragnarok deals with the ramifications of this new knowledge, and the fallout of the events that led up to acquiring it. 

It’s a very direct sequel and, maybe because of a few years of distance and watching beautified PC port footage in between, starting Ragnarok almost felt like booting up the last game and playing on right from where it ended. 

In the Sony first-party pantheon, despite the upgrade in hardware, Ragnarok feels a lot more like the jump between Uncharted 2 and Uncharted 3, rather than the more recent example of The Last of Us Parts 1 and 2. This obviously makes sense given both the development time between the rebooted God of War and Ragnarok (which would have been just a couple of years without a lengthy delay), and its cross-generation availability as well.

It looks and feels great, with detailed environments and distant landscapes in every realm, but there aren’t any huge technical or graphical feats that leap off the screen immediately. And that could make for a disappointing first impression if you’re expecting something that’s going to make your PS5 whur like a jet engine, like it does your PS4. 

That’s not to say that God of War Ragnarok is a complete retread, or does nothing to take things forward. What’s familiar swells over the course of the game – whether it’s combat styles, companion abilities, traversal or puzzle-solving – to the point where you realise later on in the whole experience just how much is different and new.The first few hours, then, feel quite close to what you’ve played already, and if Sony Santa Monica tried to introduce a lot of this more quickly, just for the sake of difference, it might have felt overwhelming or disparate, so ultimately it’s the right choice for the game as a whole. Even if, sometimes, you're encouraging it all to speed up a bit.

You’ve got a lot of time to explore the mechanical nuances once they start to show up, though. Where the console-showpiece spectacle action genre used to be a linear 6-hour firework, God of War Ragnarok is as chunky as Kratos’ own bicep, taking me just over 40 hours to complete the main story (with  about 75% of side stories, collectibles, and extra tidbits thrown in, too) on the regular difficulty. 

At the end of a main story branch, you almost always have the option to break off into a relatively compact – but very dense – open exploration area filled with environmental puzzles, mini-bosses, and fetch quests. Diving into these spaces is heavily encouraged not just for the world and character-building exploits(the main “Favours” in each area are generally good), but because they offer a lot of the best stuff and upgrades, making them pretty vital if you want to make smooth progress in the next chapter.

These areas aren’t disposable, either. More activities appear pretty constantly as the world state changes throughout the main quest and even after the credits roll, continually giving you an incentive to keep the realm-hopping family road trip rolling. But the persistent diversions can also be a bit distracting, both in the exploration areas and along the main path.There’s something hidden around nearly every corner, and sniffing it out can take you out of the moment a bit. If you’re a magpie, like me, you'll be thinking more about the collectible you need to smash in the corner while a cutscene’s playing than what’s actually going on. Those with short attention spans, be warned.

But if you know that you can’t really miss anything and you can always go back and get things that you do miss – which you know now, because I’m telling you – hopefully most people can push through that completionist itch. 

I wrote in my early impressions preview that the beginning of God of War Ragnarok’s story had me a little worried because it laid on the emotional moves thicker than the hide of the world snake, Jormungandr. Right from pressing “New Game”, it’s all heavy hearts, long sighs, and sombre silences that threaten to tip into becoming maudlin – and at this point, that feels like a Sony studio party trick.

However, character motivations quickly reestablish themselves to make everything feel more earned – and from there, Ragnarok never loses its great moments. An early standoff between the game’s main players is crackling with intense atmosphere and menace, and the unexpected and intricate characterisations of many of Ragnarok’s antagonists are almost as revolutionary as the renewed depth to Kratos’ character in the 2018 God of War. 

These moments come more frequently, more intensely, as the game edges towards its climax. Then, from the summation of the last full realm arc until the blockbuster finale, it’s gigantic, cataclysmic set-piece after set-piece – wielding the full weight of everything that’s built up to this point to grip you as aggressively and wrathfully as the characters battling on-screen. 

It’s not just about the engrossingly spectacular, but the quieter parts, too. Drawing on themes of responsibility, loss and, chiefly, the uncertainty over changing stages of life gives us an emotional impetus and makes the edge of the action cut much more keenly. Whether the story mulls on growing up, fatherhood, or death, it does it reflectively and knowingly. And it always makes you care.

The only quibble I have with all of this is where characters have a tendency to basically state the insinuations of a scene; saying the quiet part out loud when it was already well-earned and clear from the context and performances. I wouldn’t say that it undercuts anything too important, because when the real emotional moments touch down they land like a swan on water.But it does feel like there was some undue worry that people wouldn’t “get it”. This is particularly felt at the end of the main Favours in each area which often finish with a conversation which comes off a bit like a plenary at the end of a school lesson or the coda at the end of a sitcom – “so what did we all learn today?”

But that's all overshadowed by the action, anyway. Once you get used to the touch-tight camera angle(which can make it feel like you’re getting brained by things outside of your peripheral vision before you master the audio and visual cues), the arsenal of weapons, combos, and abilities at your disposal feels incredibly flexible – with supplementary items to modify almost every option available to you. 

So much information is communicated to you so naturally by subtle things – the clunk of an inert attack on an armoured enemy, or the slight twinkle of a fully-charged swing – that finding your own style within the skillset is instinctive. And that’s without the jarring stops and slowdowns that give knuckle-cracking impact to every hit and have you throwing yourself into each shot, like a football manager kicking every ball for their team on the sidelines. 

You get the biggest sense of this in the many, passionately fierce boss fights that punctuate the game. They do a great job of incorporating unique mechanics without coming off as cheap or overly simple. And, really, these boss fights are emblematic of what makes God of War Ragnarok great: they’re hugely successful meldings of an involving story and brutal action that not only produce an eye-popping, absorbing spectacle, but an impassioned investment in the outcome as well.

God of War Ragnarök,Chris White,God is a Geek,https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/god-of-war-ragnarok-review/,"November 9, 2022How do you build on a game as close to perfection as God of War? Going into the second part and final instalment of Kratos and Atreus’ story, I was scared that the strong feelings and emotional connection I had to the first one wouldn’t be matched, or that there was something in God of War Ragnarok that would let me down, disappoint, or simply not live up to the excitement I’d been feeling since it was announced. However, it took mere minutes until I realised this was going to be something incredibly special, and as I put the controller down some thirty hours later, I was left in awe at the masterpiece I had been fortunate enough to experience.To say God of War Ragnarok is ambitious would be an understatement. From its sprawling world-building to its impassioned and powerful story, Santa Monica Studio never takes its foot of the gas, putting every ounce of heart and soul into everything it has created. There are multiple moments that stay with you throughout, and I lost count of the amount of times I cried, laughed, and was left with my mouth wide open. I don’t say this lightly, but there’s a high chance this will go down as one of the best PlayStation exclusives, if not the best of all time.Combat consistently evolves, with new mechanics being thrown at you every step of the way. Beyond the Blades of Chaos and the Leviathan Axe, there are other things in your arsenal that unveil themselves, but it would honestly spoil it for you if I was to reveal just what these are. Kratos’ two biggest weapons can be switched on the fly, utilising them for different enemy types depending on if they have a weakness to ice and fire. They can also be used to solve environmental puzzles in new and interesting ways, and they both flow so well together.It takes a lot of practice to make them work in unison, and without total focus in battle, you’ll be at the mercy of a whole manner of foes. You can level up your weapons to make them more powerful; improve various stat lines; unlock new abilities, and more. When you’ve used a certain skill so many times, the option to add a buff to it gives you an extra edge in combat. There’s a hell of a lot to get used to, but once you figure out how to attack properly, fighting is sublime. Different armour can provide a range of perks, and amulet sets will also offer some additional improvements when crunching skulls and ripping through the hordes of monsters.Throughout God of War Ragnarok, there’re countless creatures you’ll have to slay. Your shield is a vital piece of equipment as there’ll be moments where you’re overwhelmed by enemies attacking all at once. Some attacks can’t be blocked, so you’ll rely on parrying to create some space and make a returning strike to catch them off guard. Every weapon can utilise a light and heavy Runic attack that, again, can be upgraded to do more damage and stun. Some of these attacks are not only great damage dealers, but they look incredible when being pulled off. In fact, the sheer range of attacks on offer have all been animated beautifully.The boss fights are some of the most amazing encounters in the game, pushing you to use every ability you have, and upon defeating them, the way Kratos rips their jaw off their face, crushes their skull with a pillar, or uses his chains to throttle them until the light leaves their eyes is a sight to behold. The fluidity of combat and movement surpasses the original and makes full use of the technology available on the PlayStation 5. This extends to the environments of God of War Ragnarok. The Nine Realms all harbour different biomes, and each one has been meticulously and masterfully designed.Vanaheim is filled with beautiful fauna and lush landscapes; Muspelheim looks like hell itself, populated by lakes of lava and volcanoes; and Svartalfheim is filled with stunning architecture thanks to the handiwork of the Dwarves that live there. Some of the realms are utterly delightful to look at. Cutscenes often blend into gameplay segments, sometimes leaving you gawping at the beauty that surrounds your every move. This was never more apparent than when the game enters its final stretch. I have never witnessed such an incredible sight, and I have no doubt that others will be just as blown away as I was. Quite simply, this is a gorgeous game to look at.Playing out alongside the main story is tons of side content for players to get stuck into. Everything blends into your main focus, as certain quests or puzzles will provide you with new equipment or powers, as well as upgradable new armour and resources. Shooting the ravens scattered around the nine realms; completing Favours for people, closing demonic portals; unlocking chests with runic locks on them; collecting flowers and artefacts; and slaying Berserkers are just some of the opportunities you’ll have in your playthrough. There’s scope to spend so much time in this phenomenal world Santa Monica has created.In terms of the story, God of War Ragnarok is filled with some beautiful moments. It is also filled with pain, joy, love, anger, and humour. Brok, Sindri, and Mimir are all on top form, with the Huldra Brothers playing a major role in the overarching narrative. After the death of Baldur in the previous game, the Gods are furious with Kratos and Atreus. Freya, Odin, and Thor all want revenge, but it is never as simple as that. The gods are fallible and by no means perfect, and as a result, they’re led by the same kind of emotions as mortals. These threads of revenge and forgiveness are tied to every story beat, with unexpected friendships being forged, and redemption never far away.It is how Kratos and Atreus are entwined with these ideas that make the story so interesting. At the end of God of War, Atreus found out he was also known as Loki, and this is something that plays a vital role in Ragnarok. The acting from everyone is award-worthy, and proof that the video game medium shouldn’t be overlooked. I was so moved by some of the performances, and my own heart broke just as some of the characters dealt with grief, loss, and suffering. Some characters are utterly brilliant, though. Mimir manages to break tension and provide light humour when needed the most, and his quips never failed to make me smile. I can’t stress enough just how epic and special the story is, and I hope others are able to get as much from it as I did.God of War Ragnarok is the definition of a masterpiece. It’s story will move you to tears, fill you with joy, and make you feel emotions you never knew were there. There’s so much to do throughout, with combat that consistently evolves and new mechanics added that never feel arbitrary. The Nine Realms are designed with care, and are some of the most wonderful worlds featured in a video game, even featuring areas that can’t be reached until new powers are unlocked later on. The layers in its design and its story will be talked about for years to come, and all those fears of it not reaching the same dizzy heights of the original dissipated shortly after once again taking control of the finest warrior the PlayStation has ever seen.Excellent combat

God of War Ragnarök,Noah Nelson,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/god-of-war-ragnarok-review/,"In God of War (2018), Faye’s posthumous wishes were granted. In sending Kratos and Atreus on a quest to spread her ashes from the highest peak in all the nine realms, truths were discovered, bonds were formed, and enemies were made. With the death of a major character in God of War (2018), the stage is set for God of War Ragnarok.Put simply, God of War Ragnarok proves itself as one of the best video games ever made. By refining almost every detail that made God of War (2018) an exceptional game, God of War Ragnarok delivers a multi-faceted adventure that will define what great narrative games look like in the future.Whether it’s the player-driven combat, detail-heavy realms, or world-class storytelling, God of War Ragnarok shines in almost every light. Know that this review is spoiler-free. Each and every moment in this game is worth experiencing for yourself. To spoil anything would be to dishonor this marvelous adventure.With so many weapons of war and attacks at your disposal, the fun is found through player-driven experimentation. Jumping off a ledge to slam your frosted axe into an enemy or grappling across a gap to lunge your flaming blades into your foes is just a few of the new combat possibilities available, but that’s not all. There are also several shield varieties to choose from, all with their own special abilities. Whether you’re a parry pro or need a portable wall to block all incoming attacks, the different shield types feel great and offer unique playstyles.In God of War Ragnarok, enemy variety isn’t a concern. As if weapon combinations weren’t enough, there are also environmental weapons that add even more choice to how you crush your competition, and the new level of verticality creates fun, diverse mini-arenas. Enemy creatures, soldiers, and undead offer different attacks that are challenging to read and stunning to watch. Even better, Atreus is grown and has a lot more autonomy to attack and kill enemies on his own.There are dozens of mini-bosses as well that make finding new areas fun and mastering combat a necessity. Don’t worry, you won’t face the same troll mini-boss over and over again.When it comes to combat, God of War Ragnarok can be boiled down to more God of War (2018). While this is true, and not at all a bad thing, Santa Monica Studio has taken the combat in God of War (2018) and elevated it. Though some may find the combat repetitive, it never feels dull because there are so many ways to approach a battle. The tried-and-refined approach to player choice and encounters all centers on a “whatever feels fun” mentality, and it merits success.God of War Ragnarok is playable on PlayStation 4, but with the PlayStation 5’s higher resolution, consistently fast frame rate, and DualSense controller, God of War Ragnarok is something to behold. With the DualSense controller, you’ll feel the light taps of rain as well as the explosive build-up of power required to sever an enemy’s head. Whispering souls in Alfheim and whistling wind in Helheim echo through the DualSense’s speaker. No matter the activity, the DualSense controller makes you truly feel like the God of War.You can feel the weight of a charged heavy attack as it sinks into the enemy. You can taste the wind as you explore the jungles of Vanaheim. And because of the plethora of accessibility options, you’re allowed to play this game exactly as you want to play it. The level of quality this game hits is top-notch. Everything works together to deliver an unforgettable experience.On PlayStation 5, God of War Ragnarok can run at 120 FPS with minor frame rate drops. Even when running toward seven different enemies that are all charging forward, you can take comfort in knowing that God of War Ragnarok is capable of handling busy areas with performance that never hinders the experience.God of War Ragnarok has no egregious bugs to speak of. In a world full of buggy live-service games and half-baked game releases, it is a breath of fresh air knowing that there are almost no bugs in God of War Ragnarok, and if there are any bugs in the game that we missed, they will surely be ironed out by a team dedicated to excellence.Last but certainly not least, there are pages of accessibility options. All of the buttons can be remapped, individual difficulty options can be adjusted, text can be recolored and resized, multiple audio options are available, and so much more. I loved seeing this degree of extensive, detailed accessibility options as it makes God of War Ragnarok playable for more gamers than ever while pushing the medium one leap forward.Speaking of immersion, Santa Monica Studio worked hard to create the most gorgeous nine realms you’ll ever see in a video game. Whether it’s the frozen whisps of Niflheim, the red deserts of Alfheim, or the sweeping vistas of Asgard, God of War Ragnarok’s environments are diverse and genuinely breathtaking. It is a shame that God of War Ragnarok doesn’t have a photo mode in the review copy. I often found myself spending several minutes in between exploring and fighting to just soak in my surroundings. God of War Ragnarok is alive.What makes the whole world of God of War Ragnarok feel alive is the incredible attention to detail. While the landscapes are colorful, distinguishable, and packed with details, the wildlife steals the show. Otherworldly pixies flutter past your boat; large magical stags run in the clearing beyond; red, green, and blue bugs glow in the dark cave you’re exploring. These explorable stages are filled with activity, beauty, and authenticity.All nine realms are explorable in this game which means there are several open arenas to get lost in. While experiencing everything God of War Ragnarok offers in its main story, you can take time to investigate one of the many surprisingly large open areas that contain meaningful collectibles and incredible side quests. It is easy to lose track of time traversing and discovering every little detail in God of War Ragnarok.Storytelling is the heart and soul of God of War Ragnarok. Whether micro or macro, God of War Ragnarok uses its colorful cast of characters to deliver well-executed, smart themes that will linger in your mind hours after you put it down. While the core of this game is still centered on a father and his son, the characters surrounding them are independent vehicles that explore other avenues of narrative in ways that no other game has successfully accomplished.What makes God of War Ragnarok a masterpiece is the characters, the themes, and the storytelling. In God of War (2018), the main characters focus on Kratos and Atreus and one of the main themes is becoming more than your mistakes. And in God of War Ragnarok, the story picks up right where it left off. The main theme is explored much further as many more are introduced, and the introduction of additional characters delivers powerful, thought-provoking dialogue that widens the scope and creates space for countless story-focused vignettes.While still part of the larger narrative, each character — Kratos, Atreus, Freya, Sindri, Brok, Odin, Thor, and many more — has their own motivations, their own past, and their own goals. The abundance of well-developed characters makes the stories told in God of War Ragnarok feel like less linear conclusions in favor of more discussions observed through multiple lenses.God of War Ragnarok is a game that asks giant questions. Does the past define who we are now? Are we free to choose our own destiny? Is violence ever justified? Themes of prophecy and choices, actions and consequences, war and peace, resentment and forgiveness, closing and opening, trust, love, family, grief, and responsibility, are topics that God of War Ragnarok — an action game that has transcended its mythological beat ’em up roots — successfully deliberates. God of War Ragnarok uses its characters to tell stories in two main ways: the Path (the main quest), and the Favors (the side quests). In short, you don’t need to worry about the Path’s quality. The Path is an absolutely phenomenal thrill-ride adventure that closes the God of War Norse saga out nicely. But honestly, we never needed to worry about whether or not the main story was going to be good or not. The Path deserves five stars, but the Favors are a new gold standard for video game side quests.Most of the Favors in God of War Ragnarok are the best side quests I’ve ever played. Without spoiling anything, the quality of the Favors can look like Kratos helping Mimir through his past mistakes and together, feeling the weight of resolution, or a growing, mindful Atreus who now contemplates the consequences of helping those who can’t help themselves while Kratos enjoys the fleeting moments with his son that only a father knows. The Favors are bite-sized stories that are all about quality over quantity.Filled with micro-narratives revolving around the themes discussed earlier, the Favors feel like necessary pieces of story since the world of God of War Ragnarok is so intertwined and obsessed with character-first storytelling. While you are playing as a god, the humanity of these multi-dimensional characters is on full display during Favors. And the way they are handled is also excellent. Favors are introduced gradually, which allows players controlled freedom instead of the decision paralysis that multiple side quests given all at once often result in.Santa Monica Studio is so confident in its Favors that major story beats are contained in them. If you want to discover the full story of God of War Ragnarok, play through all of the Favors.God of War Ragnarok invites you into a world of wonder, conflict, and conclusions. With an improved combat system, impressive new enemies, immersive environments, and unparalleled storytelling, God of War Ragnarok delivers one of the deepest, richest gaming experiences to date.Though the perfect game doesn’t exist, God of War Ragnarok’s ability to lead a player-driven, multi-layered story is worth celebrating. For people who love resonant video games that challenge the gamer both mechanically and narratively, God of War Ragnarok is an outstanding game that will stand as a beacon for what storytelling greatness should be.God of War Ragnarok is available on November 9, 2022, on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4.This game was reviewed using a copy of the game provided by the game's publisher,public relations company, developer or other for the express purpose of a review.

God of War Ragnarök,Tom Bardwell,VideoGamer,https://www.videogamer.com/reviews/god-of-war-ragnarok-review/," Posted in Reviews
Playing God of War Ragnarok is like tugging at a seemingly endless thread of yarn, every yank unfurling yet more fabric shimmying from the most lively green to the sharpest red, then blue, and on. Yards and yards of the damn stuff – realms and regions, armor and amulets, favors and labors, deaths and prophecies – mounding on the floor, cloaking shoes, legs, and nipping at the throat. It’s dense in its strewn spectacle and narrative bulk, nearly overwhelming in its vast scale.BUY NOW: If you haven’t played it yet, God of War PC is available on Green Man Gaming, play it prior to GoW: Ragnarok!Things pick up a few winters after the events of 2018’s God of War. Fimbulwinter has set in, Midgard carpeted in thick snow and howling winds. We join Kratos and Atreus nibbling on the fruits of the relationship forged in the first game, but their previous murderous spree through the Nine Realms hasn’t gone unnoticed. There’s a scorned mother’s rancor to abate, a fragile peace to barter with scheming gods, and prophesied Ragnarok to avert. A heaped plateful then.With the scene set, God of Ragnarok lobs the player into a rich semi-open world. Rich in the downright arresting quality of the visuals and, equally, the vibrant realms we’re given to explore. It’s the deliberate details. You’ll stumble on a mushroom which, upon closer inspection, has legs, arms, and even a smirk, or marvel at the way snow stirs as you hurl around Kratos’ godly mass. You’ll gape slack-jawed at the abundance of grand vistas or delight in the awkward glares when you linger too long near a god. There’s something to see at every turn, and God of War Ragnarok nudges you to explore and investigate every lush detail.NOW READ: This is who plays Odin in God of War RagnarokThe ‘Main Path’ is always beckoning. However, God of War Ragnarok’s heart really comes through in its non-mandatory sidequests styled as favors and lists of collectibles, dragging you off the beaten path into secret, sprawling areas often concealed behind seemingly inconsequential gaps or puzzles. Curiosity spiked, you’ll often find yourself off on epic tangents cleverly marshaled by paths that entwine, shortcut, and circle back on one another.The puzzles ring familiar but remain as delightful as in the original – neither convoluted nor obvious but elevated by grand payoffs. The thrill of problem-solving is often sided by grinding contraptions and churning environments, the world morphing as if to pat you on your back for your efforts. As with the first game, a single visit to a region is rarely enough, as these lands shift and expand with story beats and new equipment, prompting you to venture into previously inaccessible nooks. Backtracking never turns tedious. You’ll often meet compelling characters just as deliberately crafted as the leading cast and hear some of Mimir’s – the smartest man alive and disembodied head – most fanciful anecdotes.NOW READ: This is the best armor you can use in God of War RagnarokFor all the work put into world-building, pacing, and backdrops, it’s the crunchy combat that dovetails all these elements together. It’s all buttery smooth axe throws and visceral brawn that balance the gratifying immediacy of hacking and slashing with the more cerebral tactics of managing a stacked roster of varied enemies with unique attacks and movements. Kratos is a god and feels like one in his nimble heft, gruff pants, and pounding might. Jaws are ripped down to expose heaving rib cages, necks are ringed and torsos are split with unsettling efficiency and throbbing gore. Kratos’ violence is brutal and unsettling.  Videogamer.com is reader-supported. When you buy through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more / Images from Amazon Product Advertising API / Last updated on 2023-04-16 But it’s the variety of weapons and supporting allies that make the combat shine. From the get-go, Kratos wields the Leviathan Axe and Blades of Chaos, each supplemented by a skill tree with different moves and buffs. Later on, Kratos’ arsenal welcomes a new addition, too, but for the sake of maintaining the integrity of the experience, we won’t say any more. With these and an array of light and heavy runic attacks, armor buffs, and supporting fire from Atreus and a few other companions, there’s a huge amount of flexibility. These grow with upgrades that allow you to pick and choose where to invest supplies and resources, letting you prioritize stats and abilities. It’s immensely rewarding cycling through weapons and pulling off what feels like a choreographed chain of combos, stuns, and takedowns that look as theatric on screen as they are damaging to the beasts, ancients, and Hel-Walkers you’ll encounter. Meaningful portions of the game where we take direct control of Atreus introduce a more lithe, but equally effective fighting style, merging bow shots and summons, further adding to the immense depth of the game’s combat.This joyful violence and freedom to explore at your own pace never come at a cost to intimacy in God of War Ragnarok. Much of this is down to a return of the original reboot’s close-up, no-cuts, over-the-shoulder camera. You’re as privy to every stirring moment between father and son as Kratos tearing and cleaving through flesh and sinew. Capitalizing on the power nestled in the PS5’s black and white shell, this is all done in seamless transitions as roaming flows into spectacle fights, thrilling set pieces, and theatrical cut scenes in one sleek, frictionless motion. It’s a clever way to convey the scale of Ragnarok’s world but also make you feel very much part of it, a cog with agency and impact.Ragnarok’s journey is, again, propelled by Kratos and Atreus’ relationship. But rather than lumbering between fractious outbursts and the trials and tribulations of clueless parenting, it’s the type of bond that only emerges with time spent together. There’s trust and open affection. Kratos is no longer scolding every mistake but gently shepherding the boy’s instincts and impulses.To supplement this, God of War Ragnarok brims with an expertly written cast of feuding gods, class-act voice work, and narrative purpose. While Ragnarok retains much of the well-handled cliches of 2018’s effort and a good dose of the contemporary (mainly in its tone, sharp humor, and dialogue, which is no bad thing given the alternative may well have been a pompous, thesaurus-padded drag), it’s hard not to get swept up in the emotion of the story. The glut of ‘game’ – combat, puzzles, collectibles, sidequests, and so on – is fantastic, but the magic is in how these flesh out the myths and gods and stories, and even villains, so your mind darts back to them long after the controller’s put down for the day.All these details matter, eschewing filler status as each passing comment, distant landmark, and gamey aspects feed into an exquisite tale that expertly balances seismic story beats and serene, thoughtful pauses. Perhaps the most enduring message in Ragnarok’s tumultuous story is that godliness doesn’t divest one of humanity, of fraught pasts, fickle drama, and bitter feuds, of the blistering heft of love and hate, and the chance, as Kratos reminds us, to do better.And so, as you play, the thread is tugged, mounding ever higher, stitching itself into a quilt of pixels and polygons. A cozy blanket, as Santa Monica Studio’s Eric Williams puts it, that takes on the shape of one of the most gripping and memorable slices of crafted escapism yet seen. God of War Ragnarok is a masterpiece."
God of War Ragnarök,Rachel Kaser,GamesBeat,https://venturebeat.com/games/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-facing-your-destiny/,"Connect with top gaming leaders in Los Angeles at GamesBeat Summit 2023 this May 22-23. Register here.Sony Santa Monica’s God of War was a masterclass in emotional storytelling, delivering character development and a touching tale of parenthood wrapped up in the trappings of one of the most violent game series ever created. Could the sequel, God of War Ragnarök, surpass it? I would argue it did, though it’s taken an unorthodox path to do so. It’s at least as good as its predecessor, though it does have some of the same gameplay and story peccadilloes.Just as a warning, this review will contain very mild story spoilers — I don’t talk about anything important, but it’s impossible to address certain aspects of the game without spoiling. There are several story and character moments I can’t even discuss for fear of ruining the experience, but suffice to say there’s plenty going on in God of War Ragnarök.In this adventure, a teenage Atreus and Kratos deal with the consequences of their actions from the previous game. Fimbulwinter, the meteorological cataclysm that precedes Ragnarök, has set in when the two receive a less-than-friendly visit from none other than Thor and Odin. Forget the affable mythological Norse gods: In this game, Thor is a violent, abusive brute, and Odin conducts himself with all the predatory cordiality of a mafia kingpin.Following this little dust-up, Kratos and Atreus must decide what role, if any, they’re going to play in the Norse apocalypse — and, in a bittersweet metaphor for reaching adulthood, their decisions take them on separate paths. This means both are playable, as they each go on their own journey of discovery, complete with separate companion characters and skill sets.GamesBeat Summit 2023Join the GamesBeat community in Los Angeles this May 22-23. You’ll hear from the brightest minds within the gaming industry to share their updates on the latest developments.There’s a theme of destiny — not just whether it can be changed but whether it exists at all. Atreus spends most of the game trying to discover what role his “Loki” persona will play in the fate of the world, but others point out that the only reason he’s participating at all is because he’s been told he will, a self-fulfilling prophecy. Kratos, on the other hand, abjures destiny not because he fears the future but because he fears confronting the past that led him there.There’s something wistful about the opening parts of the game, where it becomes clear that Atreus is growing up and needs his father’s help less. The first time I went to climb a wall and Atreus didn’t leap onto Kratos’s back, I felt more than a little sad. The “boi” is growing up, and this small piece of gameplay is just a taste of what we’re going to go through the rest of the story. Kratos, like myself, spends most of the story learning to let Atreus grow and become his own person. It’s the right thing to do, but it’s still difficult for both of us.The story plays out exceptionally well, with players seeing things from the perspective of both the headstrong, stubborn Atreus and the grim, tormented Kratos. It’s easy to see where both are coming from — and it’s incredible that the game managed to make me sympathize with Atreus, who throws what can charitably be described as a teenage temper tantrum around the game’s midpoint that completely changes the direction of the story.Other than the two leads, the side characters — new and returning — are all done exceptionally well. These include Tyr, former god of war, broken by experience; Freya, violent and unhinged following the death of her son; Angrboda, Atreus’s adorable new partner-in-crime; and of course Sindri and Brok, who get more story focus than before. My favorite was Heimdall, who here resembles Hermes from the original series more than his mythological counterpart, both in punchable appearance and unbearably smug attitude. I loved to hate him.For the most part, the gameplay in Ragnarök has not changed much from the previous game. It’s still the same style of combat, and Kratos still has his trusty frost axe on hand to handle any problems that might arise. However, he also has the Blades of Chaos right from the start, giving the player more combat options. He also gains a certain weapon in the second half that instantly became my favorite.The gameplay feels much faster and crisper, for lack of a better way of putting it. Kratos’s weapons hit with more precision and power, even if their actual damage output has diminished since the end of the previous game. He’s also got more varied enemies to fight — there are the usual two-legged types, but there are also creepy-crawlies, beasties, and ghosts to add to the rogues gallery. It feels slightly closer to God of War Classic than God of War 2018.The gameplay is balanced well between combat, puzzles and story. The environmental puzzles are more complex and varied than they were at the beginning of the last game, particularly since Kratos has two weapons at his disposal (to begin with). Sometimes the gameplay feels a little safe — it doesn’t really innovate much. I don’t necessarily think it has to, as the game’s comforting rhythm of violence and discovery is part of its charm. But still, if you weren’t a fan of the last game’s combat, this one probably won’t win you over.One of my gripes with God of War 2018 was that it swapped out the third-person fixed hack-and-slash camera for a Last of Us-style over-the-shoulder perspective. I felt it slowed gameplay down more than I liked and made the act of fighting enemies in a broad arena tedious. As much as I like the character Mimir, I thought the solution of literally sticking a set of eyes on Kratos’ backside to call out attacking enemies blocked by perspective was a bit ridiculous.Tragically, that darned camera is just as big a gameplay problem in Ragnarök. It remains stubbornly perched on Kratos’s shoulder like Kazooie, and the aforementioned issue of having characters call out when you’re about to get attacked from behind is still intact. In fact here, it’s even worse because we have new companion characters, so there are several more people to shout instructions to us in combat. Just pull the camera back and let me wail on the enemies like it’s my job, please.Also, I think this should go without saying, but Ragnarok is also gorgeous. The various realms Kratos and Atreus visit look beautiful on the PS5, and the graphics and character models look even better than they did before. We visit several new realms, including Vanaheim, a lush, dangerous jungle that instantly became my favorite; and Svartalfheim, the quaint, industrialized home of the dwarves.Remember back in the early impressions where I mentioned that God of War 2018 barely referenced the original series? I might as well be an oracle, because Ragnarok drops several references. Kratos is much less taciturn on the subject, talking freely about his past in Sparta — he even mentions his daughter Calliope and his brother Deimos. To be clear, these references are later in the game than the impressions period, but I’m happy to see this particular prediction fulfilled.These references are more than simple gags. Kratos more directly confronts his past as an angry god-slayer and how this has affected both him and Atreus. At one point, a character even points out that, in terms of divine body count, Kratos hasn’t changed since the original games — he’s just sad about it now. It also follows the theme of self-fulfilling prophecy, as Kratos acknowledges how that played a role in his own story.This is even incorporated into the gameplay, with some of the boss fights — one in particular that I won’t spoil — playing out more like the boss fights of the Greek series than the 2018 title. And I loved every moment of it, as the faster gameplay helped capture some of that original Kratos hack-and-slash goodness I was missing.If I have one complaint about the story, it’s a lack of direction. In the last game, there was a definite goal and destination: Kratos and Atreus were going to scatter Faye’s ashes, and the game ended when they did that. In this one, it’s less clear what the two are trying to accomplish. At various points Atreus seems to either want to learn more about his part in Ragnarök, then at others he’s trying to avert Ragnarök. More than once, other characters comment that he has no idea what he’s doing.Similarly, Kratos is stubbornly opposed to taking part in Ragnarök at all and yet at some points seems either resigned that it will happen or is fully willing to take part in order to protect Atreus. While these choices make some kind of sense for the characters, it makes the whole journey harder to follow than the previous one. The fact they spend large portions of the game separated makes the sidequesting a bit disappointing, as Kratos adventuring with another character feels wrong no matter what the game does to smooth it out.Ragnarok has one advantage its predecessor didn’t have: The gamers playing it are more likely to know what to expect. If you were a fan of the action-heavy Greek God of War series — and here I speak from experience — the slower, more story-driven procedure of the Norse title was culture shock. So when I say Ragnarok is very much like the previous game, you know what you’re going to get.The story of God of War Ragnarök may not be as straightforward as it was in God of War, but that’s to its credit. It’s messy and complicated, but that makes the emotional payoff all the better. The gameplay remains largely unchanged, which unfortunately does lose it some points with me, but it does feel enjoyable when the player can settle into a rhythm. God of War Ragnarök is an exceptionally good game, and if you loved the last one, you’ll almost certainly love this one too.Sony provided GamesBeat with a review code for this product.

His words are imbued with a teenager’s embarrassment for his father’s behaviour, but also a tinge of defensiveness. He loves his weird, bald dad.Sign up to receive the daily top stories from the Financial Post, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.A welcome email is on its way.

Please try again  It’s a perfect encapsulation of the evolving relationship between father and son in God of War Ragnarök, the second instalment in Sony Santa Monica Studio’s refreshed take on the iconic PlayStation action series, which transplants its Spartan-warrior-turned-Greek-God protagonist to the chilly realms home to Norse mythology, where he confronts a new pantheon of angry, anthropomorphized deities.  In 2018’s God of War, Atreus was a scamp. Kratos was an overbearing father figure, almost paranoid in his protection of his son following the untimely death of the boy’s mother, but his firm hand proved necessary at times as he taught his son not to be too hasty in his hunger for danger and adventure.  The duo’s dynamic has matured in the years since.  Atreus, now a young teen, is much more thoughtful as he sets himself to learning the ways of the world and attempts to become a force for good within it. Kratos — still as humourously gruff and doggedly pragmatic as ever — has a few more lines spreading from the corners of his eyes and squiggles of grey in his beard. He realizes that his time with the boy won’t last forever — all the more so because of Ragnarök, a foretold and fast-approaching doom that will bring about the end of the worlds of both gods and mortals.   Meanwhile, Odin the Allfather (who’s still bitter about the death of his son Baldur at Kratos and Atreus’s hands in the last game), is scheming to avoid the calamity while continuing to be a lethal pain in the neck for beings across all the Nine Realms. The game begins with an epic battle between Kratos and Odin’s other son Thor, who, it turns out, isn’t nearly as good looking or charming as Chris Hemsworth would have us believe. Following Atreus’s instincts, the pair pair set off on a quest to save the world from both Odin and Ragnarök. Along the way they uncover new secrets to do with Atreus’s maternal lineage while exploring the rocky — and, for some of us, perhaps familiar — relationship between father and son. They’re joined by friends old — including foul-mouthed dwarven smiths Sindri and Brok, along with the bodiless head of wiseman Mimir, who’s still attached to Kratos’s belt — as well as some new faces, such as Angrboda, a delightful take on Loki’s famed wife. She brings some much-needed feminine temperament to this male-dominated series.  While the new games are far more character- and narrative-driven than the franchise’s original entries, rest assured Ragnarök — like its immediate predecessor — still has loads of stuff that will keep your thumbs moving. It contains pulse-pounding combat with heaping amounts of blood and gore, a building-sized beast atop which we explore and fight, tons of clever little one-off puzzles that require expert weapon handling skills, and plenty of opportunities to upgrade our heroes’ strength, gear and skills. It may have some feelings to get off its chest, but this is no walking simulator. Kratos still has his signature chain blades from his earlier escapades, along with the Leviathan Axe crafted for him Sindri and Brok in the last game, which he can hurl and call back on command (useful in both combat and puzzles). He uses them both with brutal efficiency, including finishing moves that frequently chop monsters in twain through unlikely sections of their bodies.   And Atreus — a fully playable and upgradable character in several sections of the game — has his own set of bow-based moves and animal transformation abilities in which he demonstrates a remarkable capacity for violence, often biting the heads off of enemies while in wolf form or bashing them to bloody pulps with the sturdy yew of his bow. It’s always risky when a franchise shelves a beloved character for a few levels to foist a new playable character upon the audience (see: Halo 5: Guardians), but Atreus is distinct and enjoyable and has his own set of memorable allies who hang around with him. It’s worth noting as well, that the world we explore while in the boots of both Kratos and Atreus is bliss. Filled with mythological wonders and lush details — the imaginative flora and fauna found in the Ironwood are the video game equivalent of the unforgettable alien forests seen in Avatar — I frequently found myself unconsciously stopping in my tracks to gape at sprawling scenes of dwarven industry, the shimmering, iridescent walls of elven tombs, and otherworldly vistas in the realm of the giants. I’d watch a whole movie rendered in Ragnarök’s in-game engine.  That we get to traverse these lands in all sorts of fun ways — slinging ourselves across gaps and up cliff ledges, and traveling by boat, sled, and yak — just adds to the fun. Even simply moving between worlds is entertaining, thanks to loading times cleverly hidden by short dialogue-filled journeys around the trunk of the towering Yggdrasil tree, accessed via the Bifröst. Some of this might seem a touch too familiar to those who played Kratos’s and Atreus’s 2018 outing. Ragnarök chooses to spin off of rather than reinvent that game’s wheel. And some of the things that may have annoyed you back then — such as being nudged to re-explore realms once you’ve acquired new abilities to collect items that were inaccessible the first time you visited — will likely still bug you now. Personally, I’d have preferred a little less linear progression and more of the game’s semi-open environments (though linearity is sometimes a boon from the perspective of both storytelling and progression).  And it’s fair to say that if you’re new to the series you’ll likely be a little lost at the start of this game. It’s loaded with references both subtle and blatant to events not just from the immediately preceding game, but bits and bobs of Kratos’s entire journey. Fun stuff for folks who’ve followed the franchise across five PlayStation platforms over the last 17 years, but perhaps a tad off-putting for those new to the angry muscleman’s exploits. Still, it’s hard to fault Sony Santa Monica’s writers for acknowledging the history of one of PlayStation’s most recognizable characters (or playing to his admittedly extensive fanbase).  Regardless, Ragnarök is well worth playing even if some of its callbacks fly over your head. We only get a handful of single-player games each year that deliver such high-calibre storytelling, finely tuned action, and gorgeous graphics in a single package, and Sony’s Dad of War ranks high among them once more.

Genre: Action/adventureA sense of finality permeates God of War Ragnarök. This is fitting, considering how Ragnarök signals the end of the Old Norse gods. From the game's harrowing intro all the way to its gripping climax, you’re aware of the inevitable end, which gives every action you take increased importance. This elevates God of War Ragnarök from being a simple action game into something more poignant.Beyond the game itself, God of War Ragnarök is also essentially the unofficial end of the PS4 generation. Though the PS5 version contains features such as 4K resolution, haptic feedback, 3D audio and improved performance, this is very much a PS4 game at its core. That doesn’t mar the overall experience, but it’s difficult to forget that you’re still playing a last-gen game. But if this is, indeed, the last first-party, cross-gen title that we see from Sony, then it’s a hell of a sendoff for the successful PS4.Cross-gen or not, God of War Ragnarök is an exceptional experience. It’s arguably Santa Monica Studios’ finest effort yet — and a title people will discuss for many years to come. Read on for our full God of War Ragnarök review.God of War Ragnarök takes place a few short years after its predecessor, God of War (2018) . Fimbulwinter grips Midgard, covering the Earth in snow and ice. Series protagonist Kratos, along with his son Atreus, must contend with the harsh winter environment. At the same time, they must also fend off frequent attacks from the grief-stricken goddess Freya, who seeks Kratos’ death for killing her son, Baldur.God of War Ragnarök doesn’t make you wait for the good stuff. After a chance encounter with the Aesir gods, Thor and Odin, Kratos and his allies set out to stop the All-Father and prevent Ragnarök from destroying the world.While the overarching plot is compelling, the characters’ interpersonal relationships are what hold it all together. It’s satisfying seeing how Kratos and Atreus have grown into a competent team, along with how each one deals with his respective destiny. The supporting cast, villains included, is no less intriguing. God of War Ragnarök is a masterclass in video game storytelling.God of War Ragnarök is a masterclass in video game storytelling.Side quests have narratives that are just as engaging as the main plot. You gain a greater appreciation for this game’s take on Norse mythology, as you gain insight into what motivates each character. Side quests may not be overly abundant, but they’re exceptionally crafted. The Assassin’s Creed series could learn a thing or two in this regard.I don’t want to spoil any of the game’s numerous plot twists or exciting set pieces. Suffice it to say that Santa Monica Studio delivers a gripping tale that’s as good, or better, than anything out of Hollywood recently.The latest God of War saga is a more mature affair than the admittedly juvenile (but awesome) earlier God of War entries. However, the series hasn’t forgotten its action/adventure roots, which are on full display in God of War Ragnarök.As before, Kratos’ primary weapons are the Leviathan Axe and the Blades of Chaos, which are attuned to ice and fire, respectively. The axe works well against single opponents, and you can also hurl it at pesky distant foes. The iconic Blades of Chaos don’t strike as hard as the axe, but they’re ideal for dealing with multiple enemies. You’re free to switch weapons at any time, which gives you the opportunity to unleash some truly devastating combos.Kratos receives a third weapon later in the game. I won’t spoil it here, but it’s a specific instrument of war that we’ve only seen twice before in the series. It pairs wonderfully with the axe and the blades, and I found myself using it quite a lot. It’s a fitting weapon for a Spartan warrior like Kratos.The game isn’t lacking when it comes to enemy variety, either. Each realm has distinct creatures and warriors that want to tear Kratos apart. Some bad guys are weaker against specific weapons and magic, which forces you to think on your feet and swap between different equipment as needed. As for boss battles, you’ll be pleased to know that this installment features some of the series’ finest encounters.There’s another playable character besides Kratos, although I won't get into specifics here. They have a completely different set of attacks, which become more varied as the game progresses. I found playing as another character to be a welcome change of pace, and looked forward to their sections.As you complete missions, defeat enemies and make discoveries, you’ll earn experience points that you can use to unlock skills. Skills include new combos, attacks, weapon enhancements and more. God of War Ragnarök is fairly generous with experience points, and I was able to unlock most skills simply by going through the main quest. This means you don’t have to wait until late in the game to receive some truly powerful abilities.You also level up Kratos overall by donning higher-tier armor, weapons and enchantments. Like the previous game, the level cap remains in the single digits — which makes it all the more meaningful each time you finally reach a new level.Some enemies, particularly those in side quests, might be at a higher level than you. While you can survive these encounters through pure skill (or luck!), it’s better to either equip higher-level armor or upgrade your current gear so that you’re on even footing. Leveling yourself up is a slow and steady process, but it’s extremely satisfying when you're able to finally defeat an enemy that you couldn't before.Upgradeable weapons and accessories also give you specific perks. In turn, this helps you customize a Kratos that suits your unique playstyle. For example, you can equip the surly Spartan with gear that enhances his magic attacks, or you can rock gear that helps him deal — and receive — a ton of damage. Trying out different equipment types to get the best possible build is a lot of fun.Exploring the Nine Realms brought me as much joy as slicing undead Norse warriors in half. Whether it’s the humid marshes of Svartalfheim, the overgrown forests of Vanaheim or the majestic plains of Asgard, every level brims with loot just begging to be found. Going out of your way to seek a seemingly impossible-to-reach treasure chest is almost always worth it, since you’ll find hacksilver (money), upgrade materials, equipment and more along the way.The puzzles you must complete to progress the story don’t provide a significant challenge, though. This is disappointing considering how great puzzles were in the older games. However, some of the puzzles you need to solve to open valuable treasure chests — striking three bells within a tight time limit, for example — feel sufficiently satisfying. There are also some tricky weapon and magic-based puzzles.Regardless of the era, God of War games have always featured exceptional visuals. The previous title on PS4 is still one of the best-looking games out there, even on the best gaming PCs and the Steam Deck. It’s no surprise that God of War Ragnarök is another visual stunner.I played the game on PS5, and was impressed with the amount of detail poured into every environment and character. There were several times when I stopped just to admire the gorgeous, awe-inspiring scenery. Photo mode won’t be ready at launch, which is disappointing, but I can already see people posting their best pictures on social media when the feature comes out.Composer Bear McCreary delivers another rousing soundtrack that enhances the game’s epic scope. Sound design is both subtle and in-your-face, depending on the moment. I encourage everyone to play while wearing one of the best gaming headsets.There’s a lot more to discuss about God of War Ragnarök. But it's enough to say to say that Santa Monica Studio went out of its way to create a truly memorable experience that should satisfy a large portion of the gaming community.While the game's numerous hidden load screens remind players that this is a PS4 title, that isn't enough to ruin what is an otherwise exceptional work of art. God of War Ragnarök has certainly earned a spot in our best PS5 games list.In short, get God of War Ragnarök.

God of War Ragnarök,Ron Burke,GamingTrend,https://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-fimbulwinter-fate-and-fatherhood/,"God of War: Ragnarök is an absolute masterclass in storytelling and combat balance. If you needed your review boiled down to one sentence, there it is. That said, it’s also filled to overflowing with incredible moments that will keep you on your toes for the entirety of the game, and I will not ruin those moments under any circumstances. As such, this will be a spoiler free review from top to bottom, other than some basic setup. When I assure you that I’ve not spoiled anything beyond the most surface level things, know that this is an understatement as well. God of War: Ragnarök is deep, and there’s a lot I leave to you to uncover for yourself. Let’s get to it.Ragnarök opens with a more capable teenage Atreus and a visibly exhausted Kratos venturing to the only place left in their journey – home. Lashing a deer to their sled, the duo prepare for the road ahead. Atreus, now keeping his own council, has secrets of his own, but those will have to wait. A recklessly distraught Freya pursues the pair relentlessly, and the death of Baldur brings Fimbulwinter – an bitter and endless grip of ice upon the world that carries implications far beyond the cold.God of War: Ragnarök picks up several years after the events of God of War. And that’s about all I will tell you about the story beyond stating emphatically that it’s incredible. Any attempts to tell you more would be so fraught with peril that I’ll inevitably ruin some portion of it, so I’ll stick to the mechanics of it. Even there it’ll be a light touch.Starting out any sequel, you know that the first order of business is a reset, and Fimbulwinter provides that easily enough. The weather crash has weakened both Kratos and his son, strengthened their enemies, and hand-waved you back to level 1. Mimir even jokes about it, so no need for a singular de-powering event. More than this, however, there are a number of new mechanics that provide the next iteration of combat for the God of War series.Both weapons from the first game, the Leviathan Axe and the Blades of Chaos, return, but they are greatly expanded in both utility and power. The Blades of Chaos can now be used to grapple to ledges to traverse the environment, and both weapons can be unleashed after leaping off of higher ground for a massive crash attack. Kratos has the ability to charge up the Leviathan Axe with a powerful ice enchantment called “Frost Awaken”. This makes the next attack deal ice damage, and that’s just getting things started. The Blades of Chaos can be thrown into an enemy, impaling them with an appropriately-named attack called “Whiplash”. As Kratos whips the chains, gouts of fire roil up the length, burning the target at the end. Enemies can now possess elemental armor. This can be a real force multiplier for them, so removing that armor and opening them up to stronger attack is important. In the previous game, the triangle button was used to recall the Leviathan Axe, meaning it was rarely used beyond that function. Now this is used to activate these “Weapon Signature Moves”, as well as signaling Atreus to unleash his deadly arrows. And yes, it can still recall the axe.You’ll note that Kratos and Atreus now have separate experience point pools. As before you’ll be unlocking your skills with that experience, but now you’ll also install “mod tokens” that can be slotted on some skills to further augment their use for elemental impact, defensive boosts, or offensive capabilities. Once unlocked, each offers three additional variables for the min/maxers out there, though ultimately it’s skill that will win the day – stats won’t save you against a massive crocodile beast many times your size that threatens to eat you whole.There was one obvious item left out of God of War (2018). Though you could collect a wide variety of very cool looking shields, they were all merely cosmetic changes between them. Now, these shields are another valuable part of your arsenal. Each shield has a specific function, so having the right gear at the right time begins to matter. For example, the Dauntless Shield allows Kratos to respond with a massive smash attack that hurls enemies away from Kratos, stunning them, provided you can nail that perfect parry. Conversely, the Stonewall Shield is more of a defensive implement. While Kratos loses the ability to actively parry with it, it provides a huge bulwark against incoming damage. As enemies crash against the shield over and over, it builds a kinetic energy. Fully charged, Kratos will slam the shield into the ground, sending a massive pulse out that knocks every foe on the screen to the ground, stunned. Additionally, you can use your shield as a weapon, holding it aloft and striking it at the last moment to stun them. It’s another tool in your arsenal, and it feels as realized as every other weapon.There are upgrades for your armor and equipment, just like in the first title, but it’s been expanded greatly here. Every piece of equipment has upwards of nine upgrades available, with the higher tier upgrades requiring increasingly rare materials and Hacksilver. Additionally, there are more unique items than before, and not just found at the endgame.Atreus’s skill with a bow has increased dramatically, as has his ability to handle his mother’s blade. As such, he can hold his own in battle. Brok and Sindri are on hand to help, of course, granting additional upgrades to his arrows. Here we see another expansion on armor and weapons as his equipment can also be improved, though not to the granularity of what Kratos carries.God of War was nothing if not expansive, though the Bifrost could only carry to six of the nine realms. In God of War: Ragnarök you’ll be visiting Asgard, Vanaheim, and Svartalfheim, as well as Midgard, Alfheim, Helheim, Muspelheim, Niflheim, and yes – even Jotunheim. Some of these worlds are smaller than others, yes, but there is no arguing that they are fully fleshed out and completely realized worlds. I particularly enjoyed Alfheim, and for two very, very large reasons that I won’t reveal to you here – you’ll meet them soon enough.The other area where God of War arguably stumbled was in enemy variety. You spent a great deal knocking down Draugr and Dark Elves, with a handful of other foes dashed in periodically for flavor. Here, you’ll encounter new and unfriendly faces bespoke to each realm. Massive beasts, centaurs, poison-spitting Grims, several varieties of Tatzelwurm, plants that spit needles, acid spewing river beasts, Draugr, Dark Elves, and far more that I won’t spoil here are just a few of the creatures that’ll cross your path. The Bestiary is filled to the brim with excellent drawings and backstory on each, and I have to say I enjoyed fighting everything in the game. Even when they kicked my teeth in, it felt fair…other than a certain librarian…she can go straight to Helheim. Joking aside, Sony Santa Monica has done a wonderful job populating this world with life, and it feels very much lived in now. Truly – well done.I cannot say more on combat other than to say it’s extraordinarily nuanced, well balanced, greatly expanded, and downright unpredictable. At any moment you may be ambushed or attacked, and often without warning. While you knew you were about to step into a tough fight in God of War when you reached into the breach between realms, here it can happen at any time – be ready.One of the biggest changes to the formula is the verticality that God of War: Ragnarök is bringing to the table. As Kratos can use his Chains of Chaos to ascend to higher ground, which is handy for a rapid attack from above, but now can also be used to solve puzzles from a different angle, or to simply open up new ways to explore. Yes, it’s still linear of course, but with this additional height there’s a great deal more opportunities for exploration.Every game Sony puts out is another opportunity to embrace the DualSense, and wow does Ragnarök do exactly that, at least early on. The tinkling of the chains on your sled dogs comes from the controller itself, the triggers carry different weight as you swing the axe into fallen logs, and the thud of the Chains of Chaos impacting your foes all make the DualSense sing. The light on the DualSense reflects a great many things, on the off chance you happen to be looking at it. While on the water it turns a lovely shade of blue, and it’s murderously red when Kratos unleashes his rage. I do wish that these early moments were painted throughout, but what’s here is top-shelf.God of War: Ragnarök carries four graphics options, as we’ve come to expect on Sony PlayStation 5 titles – a full 4K resolution locked at 30fps, and a dynamic upscale to 4K shooting for (and mostly hitting) 60fps being the most relevant pair for most.  If you have a high-refresh TV, however, you’ll have something more to look forward to as there’s also a 4K/40fps locked, and a variable rate 120fps, provided you have an HDMI 2.1 capable TV with 120hz refresh rate at your fingertips.  It’s entirely up to you, of course, which way you choose to experience the game, though I admit that I preferred the steadiness of the locked framerate with high framerate than a flexible one. Just know that options await, and more than you likely expected.Honestly I could write an entire article twice the length of this one already just to talk about the accessibility options. Frankly, I’m not even sure I understand all of them. There are over 60 options, with simple things like UI text size and color filters, all the way to descriptive services and colors to help those of varied visual impairments. Frankly, it’s astounding. I thought previous efforts like The Last of Us and Horizon Forbidden West had raised the bar – God of War: Ragnarök is on a whole different level entirely. Given that so many games can’t be bothered to even give us a colored background for subtitles, this level of devotion to ensure all gamers engage is greatly appreciated.To help bring this game to life, Sony Santa Monica once again turned to the legendary Bear McCreary for the soundtrack. Once again he delivers in spades. God of War has long since ceased being endless slaughter, giving way to a man and his son, and the growth of their experiences. Bear provides the backdrop for these moments, as well as the strife in between, and honestly it’s one of the reasons to pick up the Collector’s Edition – as if you needed another reason.I don’t know who this little guy is, I just know that I have to find out his ENTIRE story….One of my favorite things about God of War: Ragnarök is the pacing. Just like this review, it’s introducing new mechanics and changing the conversation once again to customization and combat. Throughout this adventure you’ll suddenly find yourself being pushed out of your comfortable lane, giving you new ways to fight. Just when I thought I was fully settled into my groove, I received an amulet that gave me nearly a dozen (literally!) new opportunities to change things up. At some point I expected the weight of all of these systems to collapse the fragile balance, but somehow…it didn’t. It provides endless possibilities to change up combat, and frankly I think I’ll end up paying God of War: Ragnarök the highest compliment I can – playing it all over again, and then revisiting it if and when it arrives on PC. It’s just that good.I did run into a few bugs while playing Ragnarök. Frequently when I’d reveal a new entry for my Bestiary, or a fresh lore entry, I’d open it with the touch pad and be greeted with the empty screen below. If I went back in I could view the entry, but this is a repeat occurrence. I’ve also had Kratos get stuck with his hand out, waiting on an axe that isn’t coming as he walks through a cutscene. The only way to regain control was to exit the game and restart it. This happened three times over the course of the game. Not egregious, but it’s going to need some attention so as to not break the immersion of this fantastic story.Ultimately you probably knew this was going to be a fantastic game, based on the incredible title from 2018. What blows me away is just how much better this game is than its predecessor. There have been some incredible games this year, but this is it – God of War: Ragnarök is your frontrunner for Game of the Year.It’s rare to see a sequel nail it this hard, but God of War: Ragnarök has once again raised the bar for every action adventure title. It’s the best game I’ve played in a very, very long time, and is, in a word, perfect.—Ron BurkeSee below for our list of partners and affiliates:One of the longest running independent gaming news, reviews and culture sites on the web.The thing that is magical about the Wizarding World isn’t the magic – it’s...by Ron BurkeThe world is going to end.

God of War Ragnarök,Keza MacDonald,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/nov/03/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-walk-among-gods-in-a-mythological-epic,"PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5; Santa Monica Studio/SonyThis imaginative sequel is a blast, as Kratos and his wayward son fight their way through the nine realms trying to avert the war to end all warsIn 2018’s superb reboot of God of War, we followed retired Spartan god-killer Kratos and his son Atreus on an epic journey to the tallest peak in the nine realms of Norse mythology, on a quest to scatter the ashes of Kratos’s late wife. In doing so, they got caught up in the affairs of the capricious gods of the land, unwittingly kicking off Ragnarök – the end of the world. At the end, they find out that they have unwittingly been fulfilling a prophecy, all that time; their every step was foretold.This sequel is a game about whether you can escape your fate, and also whether it’s possible for teenaged boys not to make decisions so incredibly poor and self-serving that you have no choice but to put your head in your hands and watch through parted fingers. It is also a game about putting an axe through the heads of as many breathtaking mythological beasts as you can fit into a 30-hour-plus runtime.Ragnarök’s eye-catchingly violent combat is peerless – multilayered but not overcomplicated. It feels absurdly good to hurl that axe at a monstrous crocodile and summon it back into Kratos’s palm, and to send enemies flying backwards with a wide swing of his flaming flails, or bash them with a shield before ripping them apart. You do a lot of fighting here, and it is remarkable that it doesn’t start to feel stale and repetitive: the variety of enemies across the nine realms certainly helps, from flaming ogres to undead soldiers, dragons and Asgardian champions on their armoured mounts.That said: can we have a permanent ban on enemies that explode when you kill them, please? There are few more annoying ways to lose a chunk of your health, and in Ragnarök you will need all the health you can get, as the fights are thrillingly challenging. I died frequently, and was thankful for the generous checkpointing.God of War’s gods are the interesting, classical kind: volatile screw-ups sent mostly mad with boredom by immortality. They have that fascinating combination of human problems and inhuman abilities; Thor drowns himself in drink to numb himself, like many men, but he also enjoys sending his magic hammer through hordes of the undead to relieve stress.Superhero fiction, too, enjoys humanising its subjects to enliven the old save-the-world narrative, but unlike superheroes, these gods are neither tediously moral nor massively concerned with the greater good. They are usually just trying to deal with their own issues, which have compounded over the course of hundreds or thousands of years. Freya is figuratively trapped by the lingering trauma of an abusive marriage, but also literally trapped in Midgard by a complex magic spell that you spend a significant portion of the game trying to undo.It’s all unexpectedly relatable is what I’m saying – the absurdly violent action and monster-slaying and breathtaking fights are rooted in this story about a bunch of quasi-immortal misfits lashing out in all directions, trying to find themselves.There are several interesting dynamics here between characters, but the central relationship of the game is still the one between Kratos and Atreus. Where 2018’s God of War was about them learning how to connect in the absence of Atreus’s mother, Ragnarök is about them learning how to break apart. They are not always side by side on this journey: Kratos is often accompanied by a different bow-wielding support character, and Atreus by other heavy-weapons beefcakes.Atreus, here, is your classic wayward teenager, good-hearted but so tragically caught up in his own immediate interests and feelings that he struggles to act sensibly. His predictably idiotic actions in this game will elicit a groan from anyone who has ever lived with teenagers, even though Atreus is sneaking out at night to parley with exiled gods or look for lost mythical artefacts rather than smoke joints at the skate park.Christopher Judge once again gives a superb performance as Kratos, the Spartan former god-slayer who cannot seem to escape the bloodshed of his old life. He is so gruff and reserved that it would be ripe for parody if there weren’t also such understated emotion in it at times. Richard Schiff is particularly great as the mercurial Odin, stealing every scene he’s in. I won’t call out other performances for fear of spoilers, but the entire cast is great; with so much complex mythological backstory going on here, it would be easy to just switch off when people are talking, but I was engaged throughout.Atreus’s sections are slower and significantly less fun, and also more linear, than Kratos’; fighting with a bow and arrow just isn’t as snappy or exciting as up-close-and-personal weaponry. Pacing is the game’s only major problem, as it tries to fit in its story-heavy tranches while leaving you space to explore the realms. I very much wanted to explore, too, because they are awe-inspiring: run-down dwarven cities, elaborate elven palaces, Midgard’s frozen woods and the once-verdant, now-rotting Vanaheim.These places are designed for discovery as much as fighting; temples stand out in the distance through blizzards, interesting structures beckon you towards them, and puzzles reward you with lost treasure. Adventuring with Atreus and long-imprisoned Norse war god Tyr in the early game, the two of them were continually making fun of my random detours. “Kratos, the way out is over … oh, a chest. I see.”2018’s God of War’s most astonishing feat of technical wizardry was constructing the entire game as one continuous shot, with no loading screens and no interruptions, making you feel totally present in the journey. It did this by putting plenty of narrow passageways and low tunnels and other confined spaces in-between its areas, to disguise that the game was loading the next one. Ragnarök repeats this trick – even more impressively, this time, as we sometimes follow different characters and not just Kratos – but on the PlayStation 5 it’s all rather unnecessary, as that console is powerful enough to do away with loading times entirely. The forced moments of slowdown felt strangely ponderous and old-fashioned. I am looking forward to seeing what Santa Monica Studio will achieve without the almost 10-year-old PlayStation 4’s technical constraints to account for.Ragnarök is an evolution, where its predecessor was a revelation. Some of its additions – such as magical sigil arrows, which must be placed very precisely to work and which make the puzzles that involve them arduously fiddly – do not quite justify themselves. But the sense of scale, the narrative ambition and the brilliance of the combat are undimmed, and it remains abundantly, jaw-droppingly beautiful.There haven’t been many interpretations of ancient mythology as gripping, detailed and imaginative as this, in video games or any other medium. It brings the stories and characters of an ancient era to life in a way that only modern technology could realise.God of War: Ragnarök is out on 9 November; £69.99"

			Kratos and son return in a spectacular, realm-trotting adventure
		In the wake of 2018’s wildly successful God of War reboot, former lead combat designer Vince Napoli lifted the curtain on one of the game’s –no, one of gaming’s– most satisfying mechanic: the boomerang recall of titular deity Kratos’ Leviathan Axe.Kratos hurls his totemic weapon with terrifying force, before the tap of a button brings it spiralling back to his outstretched hand with a shudder, slicing and dicing anything it passes on its way home. In a Game Developer blog post Napoli detailed the attention that went into honing the mechanic: whether to wiggle free from trees, the right arc, the exact amount of time before waiting for its return became too long (1.5 seconds, by the way). Particular credit went to engineer George Mawle, who sadly passed away last year. It’s a fascinating read for those with an interest in the nitty-gritty of game development; but playing, watching or reading, it all leads to the same conclusion: throwing the axe feels bloody good.God of War: Ragnarok is all about feel. Its predecessor was too, but as is the way with video game sequels, everything is heightened and expanded. Even your senses. So the axe’s muscular heft in combat crunches against mythical Nordic beasts; thumping, frozen swings meeting flesh, the axe thrown and embedded into some other ghoul turned to ice, a few hammering fists and a boot for good measure while its away, before being recalled and used to separate head from neck in a visceral show of blood and sinew.Kratos has his Blades of Chaos from the start; deadly, whirling chains doused in fire and attached to the wrist; groups are swatted in a criss-cross lightshow. Harpoon a floating eyeball, yank it towards you before crushing it to goo in your hand. Both blades thud into a bigger foe, a pulse of flame rattling down the chains and igniting your target. That feels bloody good too.That weight isn’t just in combat either. As you travel the realms of Norse mythology snowstorms whip and snarl in Midgard, the towering contraptions of the dwarves of Svartalfheim crunch and clank. You will twist levers and grapple walls, axe aimed in a careful loop to sever writhing dark matter in the bowels of elven Alfheim. And have you ever seen a vengeful god use a key? Kratos doesn’t just unlock doors, he smashes the key into the lock before yanking them open as if they had wronged him. Which, in a way, they did: by getting in his way. Ditto chests, lids pummeled to splinters so you can liberate the treasure inside.There is a lot of that. Stressing how good God of War is in the hands is important because underneath the formula is comfortingly familiar. Though the framing has moved on of course. Kratos and his son Atreus –less ‘boy’, more adolescent– are sheltered in Midgard during Fimbulwinter, staying out of trouble while Kratos continues to train Atreus. The brutal cold snap is said to be the precursor of Ragnarok, the ordained destruction of the realms of gods and men. Atreus believes there is a way to avoid the apocalypse, if only Dad would agree to travel the realms again to find it. Kratos only wants to protect Atreus for as long as he can, but a violent visit from mobbish All-Father Odin and his brutish son Thor sends them on their way.So off you pop. Kratos, Atreus and loqacious severed Scottish heid Mimir journeying between realms, fighting beasts, completing clever environmental puzzles that block your way (usually including freezing things, hitting things or setting them on fire) and collecting trinkets and power-ups to unlock new skills and shiny new armour.  It has RPG-trappings, but isn’t an RPG, with skill trees and upgradable gear – axe pommels that give +23 strength and slows down time on perfect dodges, lovely big pauldrons with ornate detail and a health boost. It has Metroidvania style gear gating, with tempting locked areas scattered throughout the world blocked by obstacles you don’t have the kit for, but its backtracking is done at your pace and usually because you actually want to see what was behind it.It is, again like its predecessor, a grab bag of recognisable video game conceits, including those plundered from its own history. But it is all executed with such skill, confidence and absurd expense that it rarely matters that we’ve been here before.What it does operate in is scale. All that stuff is bigger and more fleshed out; I have spent much more time in Ragnarok thinking about my modest muddle of stats. I looked forward to returning to gobby dwarven smiths Brok and Sindri, for both the foul-mouthed conversation and the upgrades to my shield. The side-missions are something to behold too. While God of War: Ragnarok keeps things moving on a linear track, it will often tempt you with an adventure within the adventure.Early on in Svartalfheim, a remorseful Mimir pleads with you to investigate a clutch of rigs he set up in a past life to enslave unfortunate dwarves for Odin’s needs. It sends you out boating into a vast lake, giving you time to explore while you junk each contraption, before spinning off in another direction entirely. You are off the main quest for a good couple of hours, but comes with an exploration of the characters’ past, a further grounding in the world and a payoff that goes way beyond a simple XP boost. It feels like it matters, basically, which is a thing many (most?) video games struggle with when it comes to extra-curriculars.A lot of ‘things mattering’ can be traced to the relationship between Kratos and Atreus, which is unquestionably the driving force behind the game’s narrative. The bond between the two has deepened and Atreus is a more rounded character in his teen years. As he deals with his supposed fate as the saviour of realms and comes into new powers, that this is a parable on growing up is not exactly subtle.But it doesn’t need to be. It also touches, deftly I thought, on the ingrained parental fear of time running out, of failure, of death. For all of his grumpy demeanour and demands of Atreus, that fear and vulnerability ripples through Kratos as much as his muscles. It is surprisingly touching at times, given that this is a game largely about pulping bad guys with a magic axe. One throwaway moment has Atreus asking why they have embarked on another lengthy sidequest rather than focussing on the task at hand. Mimir gently suggests that it is because Kratos wants to spend more time with his son before the world ends. A quiet moment in the game’s comparatively measured first half that makes the latter game fire, brimstone and narrative gutpunches hit harder. Some of the previous games’ gripes have been clearly addressed. Perhaps most notable is that the combat benefits from a broader range of enemies to slaughter; mixed into ever-shifting groups that demand a broader mastery of Kratos’ skills and arsenal. Atreus is a much more advanced battle partner too. He has a wicked line in magic arrows, shields, spells and now has the strength to give beasts a good smack with his bow. During fights is he never a burden, only a boon; a now crucial extension of Kratos’ skills who can look after himself.Until you are given direct control, of course. It probably won’t surprise that Atreus gets his own sections away from Dad in Ragnarok, as he sneaks away to pursue his apparent destiny. These naturally don’t provide quite the crunchy fun that comes with being Kratos, but he is whip-quick and skilled enough that being the boy brings its own kick. And necessarily helps to progress his tale –his life– without his father’s presence. As children growing up are wont to do…For all of this, God of War Ragnarok does not forget it is, first and foremost, a ‘triple-A’ video game with broad appeal and a grizzled determination for crowd-pleasing pleasures. You will embark on literal rollercoasters, zombie draugrs smashing at your cart. Travel through gorgeous realms that vary in staggering detail and vivid colour. Take on toothy, screen-filling bosses. And, of course, do battle with the villainous gods of Asgard. As quiet and introspective it can be, reserved it is not.It can’t help but bring some of the inherent drawbacks of excess. There is bloat and meandering at times, particularly near the start. And smashing open a chest every fifty paces for more trinkets, even during some heartfelt conversation, suggests it can’t entirely cut itself free from number-chasing gratification. But God of War: Ragnarok manages to wrangle the best of blockbuster gaming under its muscular control. Spectacle. Excitement. Empowerment. And, well, we all know how that feels, don’t we?"

In our first impressions of the game, we were able to discuss some of its early moments – while they were certainly memorable, it felt like a safe sequel building on established mechanics and concepts that made God of War a spectacular entry into the franchise. But having rolled credits on protagonist Kratos’s latest journey, Ragnarok has successfully managed to exceed our initial expectations. It’s difficult to discuss Ragnarok without reference to the previous game. For those unfamiliar with 2018’s release, a brief summation of its broader strokes can be reviewed on the game’s start screen, acting as a “previously on” sting for Ragnarok’s main fare. But going forward, it’s best to discuss where this sequel has made significant strides from its predecessor (while still retaining as many of its secrets as possible, so as not to spoil the enjoyment). Our review of God of War Ragnarok is based on the PS5 version of the game. Having played for around 30 hours, we were able to complete the main story and explore its optional side content as well. For our full review, keep reading this article. The IndependentWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later? Start your Independent Premium subscription today.A number of years has passed since the events of 2018’s God of War, with the true nature of Kratos’s son, Atreus, having been revealed at the end of their last adventure, which was also directly prophesied as the beginning of “Ragnarok” – the end of all things. While a seemingly understandable call to arms – prevent existence itself from imploding – Kratos’s main concern is keeping out of the hateful gaze of the remaining Norse gods, and spending what remaining time he may have left with his son. Atreus, on the other hand, is insistent that what little time left should be spent in pursuit of a solution to the impending cataclysm, rather than licking their wounds.As with 2018’s God of War, the pitting of an endless cycle of violence against a sense of duty reverberates loudly through all nine of Ragnarok’s realms, while continuing to explore the nuance’s of their father-son bond at great depths. Of course, there’s tension and resentment that waxes and wanes through their relationship but it’s ultimately held together by a mutual respect and trust for one another that has blossomed through their various trials and tribulations.Read more: Best deals on God of War RagnarokKratos and Atreus’s growth is placed front and centre in their (literal) saga but the supporting cast feels more endowed with purpose than a simple rogues’ gallery. All of the recognisable gods that appear are elevated from their usual depictions for a contemporary reimagining, with traditional tales of the Norse pantheon given modern sensibilities.Each of the characters encountered on the journey is intriguing enough, but their behaviours and personalities as a way for familial struggles to be personified make them not only a framing device for Kratos and Atreus’s own relationship, but players will likely find their own parallels with them too. It’s a testament to how well crafted each of these characters is, regardless of the amount of time they appear on screen. Depictions of trauma, grief, substance abuse, and coercion are all present but meaningfully framed in a way that’s respectful to the intended audience.Read more: Everything we know about PS VR2The expanse of Ragnarok’s scope compared with its prequel is monumental. “Fimbulwinter” – the precursor to Ragnarok itself – has set in across all the realms, leading to a seismic shift in the natural balance of things. Familiar lands such as Midgard and Alfheim have been reimagined with a sense of overlying doom. Drastic shifts in temperatures and the increase of natural disasters may be a not-so-subtle way of illustrating the beginning of the end, but its immediacy and characters’ trepidation to the snap-change is palpable.Other new areas, such as the dwarven realm of Svartalfheim, also act as a thoughtful and era-appropriate backdrop to the heroes’ saga, with different areas being visited in great abundance. The areas that can be visited at numerous times also serve to act as places of interest for other quests, or “favours”, outside the story’s scope. These are substantial in the time it takes to undertake them, but also offer worthy enough rewards for seeing them through to completion – in terms of expanding Ragnarok’s established narrative and corporeal benefits to add to Kratos and Atreus’s extensive collection.Read more: Upcoming PS5 games for 2022 and 2023Where Ragnarok really shines is its combat, with a tightly whisked mixture of existing weapons, while expanding on those existing formulas in a meaningful way. The leviathan axe is a deft ice-based tool that can be thrown and recalled for a satisfying combination of close and ranged attacks that neatly pair with the fire-based blades of chaos that can cover wide areas. Switching between both is near-effortless and learning the intricacies between how both can play off each other makes for an even more rewarding cocktail of flurries and blows. Kratos’s own arsenal expands beyond this, with upgrades, runic elements and skill trees, along with more substantial improvements to his versatility on the battlefield, which are best left for you to discover.Where Kratos delivers in heavy blows, Atreus is a nimble companion. Able to stun enemies, move quickly and execute commands given by his father, while still making himself as much of an asset to Kratos’s one-man army as well as being formidable in his own right. Atreus can also switch between two types of arrows that cause different effects on hordes of enemies and the environment. Having access to his own skill tree also allows Atreus to progress in tandem with his father, giving him more agency than simply acting as Kratos’s sidekick.After the dust has settled and the credits have rolled, God of War Ragnarok is as strong a continuation as anyone could have hoped for, and a fitting end to Kratos’s latest chapter. Few game loops have been as engaging to experiment with and ultimately master than Kratos’s own brutality, but by adding new dimensions to an already intoxicating equation, the game successfully manages to deliver on the high expectations its predecessor laid bare at the altar. On its own merits, it’s difficult to fault but on the foundations of 2018’s God of War, it’s nothing short of a masterpiece.Want to pick up the game?

God of War Ragnarök,Lloyd Coombes,Dexerto,https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-1974333/,"News, reviews, tips and guides for the biggest and best gamesGod of War Ragnarok is a triumph, and is easily reason enough to buy a PlayStation 5 thanks to a fantastic story, great characters, and combat that’s even better than its predecessor’s.What makes a man? What makes a god? Those two questions are buried deep within God of War Ragnarok’s story, but there’s so much more than that, too. God of War’s 2018 soft reboot succeeded because it made Kratos more human than ever, and dealt with the familiar themes of grief and paternal love. It’s perhaps fitting then that Kratos and Atreus’s new journey, which takes them to new realms and wondrous worlds, also weaves in new elements — the concept of fate, human nature, and whether we are born to walk a certain path or choose our own.Across its 35 to 40-hour journey, it constantly builds on its own rich world, introducing new lore, new concepts, new mechanics, and much more to build an unforgettable adventure that, when I finished it, had me feeling more than a little sad that it was over.Note: We’ve done our best to keep this review spoiler free, but if you’re looking to go into the game without any prior knowledge, turn back just to be safe.As sequels constantly look to “go bigger”, Ragnarok starts small — reuniting with Kratos, Atreus, and Mimir in their cabin felt like meeting up with old friends. In our preview, I noted all I wanted after the 2018 reboot was to spend more time with these characters, and Ragnarok certainly delivers that.After three years of Fimbulwinter, Kratos and Atreus have been dealing with near-constant attacks from the grieving Freya, a mother who buried her son, before Odin and Thor arrive offering peace and taking particular interest in Atreus. To spoil more would be wicked, but it’s clear from this early stage that God of War Ragnarok is happy to introduce more of its leading lineup of Norse gods.Many deities that had only been mentioned in the last game are seen here, brought to life by nuanced and impressive performances. Much has been made of Thor, played by Sons of Anarchy’s Ryan Hurst, but it’s Richard Schiff of West Wing fame who is perfectly cast as Odin. Schiff’s portrayal of the Allfather is perfect, flitting between moments of calm to occasional outbursts and bristling with sarcasm. He’s an eccentric uncle one minute, then a welcoming father figure the next, and steals every scene.That could be said about many of the cast, though, and maybe it was becoming a father myself in the years between God of War 2018 and Ragnarok, or the power of a new console generation, but Kratos and Atreus have never felt more like real people than they do here. The subtle furrowing of Kratos’ brow, the deep sigh of an unhappy Atreus, or the way both battle through complex themes is palpable.Throughout its lengthy story, God of War Ragnarok weaves its central pairing into every part of its world, building relationships with almost every character around them in a believable way. Much of the game’s central through-line is the concept of outrunning fate — are we destined to do the things we do, and how much of our free will is an illusion? This often sobering and always weighty debate spreads like a vine throughout most facets of Ragnarok’s story, intertwining itself with not just forgiveness, but whether hate can outweigh it in a way that feels like a companion piece to The Last of Us 2.Nowhere are these tangled threads of human emotion felt more than in Freya’s story, though, as she reckons with anguish, anger, forgiveness, and betrayal in a way that feels earned, not just convenient for the plot. That’s not to say there aren’t some conveniences, but as a realm-trotting yarn that spans worlds we dreamt of seeing in the 2018 game, Ragnarok’s scale is almost unmatched.Gods are relatable characters, with desires, complex backstories, and family feuds that make them feel partway between Game of Thrones characters and a celestial soap opera. Even in scenes where Kratos takes a backseat, I found myself glued to the screen as mythological beings argued about family politics.And yet, throughout all of these deep-seated discussions, there’s more to uncover, more to digest, and more that’s sure to light up forums for years to come. Every journey with God of War Ragnarok will be a personal one, and there’s something incredibly beautiful in that. It’s a game that leads its audience by the hand through mystical worlds, but lets them draw their own conclusion as to why.Speaking of beauty, God of War Ragnarok is a stunning technical showcase for the PlayStation 5. Whereas the last game saw Atreus and Kratos head to many of the nine realms, Ragnarok removes the shackles — it’s not open-world, instead following a structure closer to Insomniac’s Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart.Everywhere in each sprawling section, there are side quests to undertake, often including some of the game’s most memorable dialogue, ranging from monsters to slay to helping locals, and it helps each realm feel distinct in a way that makes them feel less like “ice realm”, “fire realm”, “elf realm” like they did last time around.After 35 hours, I had plenty more to complete aside from the main quest, and new combat trials with tougher enemies can be sought out, too, which was a pleasure to do thanks to God of War Ragnarok’s superlative combat.Subscribe to our newsletter for the latest updates on Esports, Gaming and more.Almost every button on the Dualsense controller is used for something that can lay waste to the various monsters of the nine realms, building on everything Kratos learned last time around to provide one of the best third-person combat systems I’ve played.Take the Blades of Chaos, for example, which made a surprise reappearance in the last game. Since Kratos begins the game with these, and his Leviathan Axe, he’s able to switch between the two from the jump. That’s helpful this time around because some enemies have shields that need to be worn down by either fire or ice.Each of Kratos’ weapons can now be charged by holding triangle, increasing the burn or freeze damage, and the vast skill tree allows for ever more flashy moves. They don’t get much flashier than runic attacks, of which there are plenty of new additions. Add in the Dualsense controller’s improved haptics and there really is nothing better outside of Elden Ring.The combination of multiple weapons and abilities, a new shield strike that breaks guard, parrying attacks and gruesome finishers make Ragnarok one of the best-feeling games since, well, 2018. Pair that with the feedback of the Dualsense, immaculate audio design (particularly for those using a headset capable of 3D audio) and the subtle pauses and nuances of the animation on show and God of War Ragnarok becomes the blueprint for third-person action games going forward.Thankfully, God of War Ragnarok rolls these mechanics out slowly and ties many of them to exploration, Metroid style. New abilities for Kratos or Atreus may be great for tearing through Draugr, but they may also open up a new path. Few games have rewarded my curiosity like this, and knowing I didn’t have the right tool to unlock something only made me much more determined to return to it later.Puzzles perfectly walk the line between being challenging and making you feel like a genius when solving them, and they’re certainly more devious than in the prior game thanks to an increased toolkit of weapons and abilities to help break up the monotony of freezing gears and setting brambles alight that started to creep in last time.In fact, even as late as 30 hours into the game, God of War Ragnarok was continuing to introduce new elements and gameplay concepts that prevented things from feeling stale, even in areas I’d already visited.Bear McCreary is fast becoming a household name in video game music, but the soundtrack to Ragnarok may be the composer’s best work yet. The addition of new gods means McCreary can draw from new influences, with textured motifs and character themes that elevate the soundscape he founded the last game’s battles on.It takes a lot to stand alongside the last game’s main musical theme, but multiple moments in God of War Ragnarok were taken to goosebumps-inducing levels thanks to the score.God of War Ragnarok is a complex, thoughtful game that takes everything that made its predecessor an unmissable experience to even greater heights. Its story is full of memorable characters, woven seamlessly into a series of worlds that feel more alive than ever, and its combat continues to add interesting new wrinkles dozens of hours in. Ragnarok is here, and it is glorious.Reviewed on PlayStation 5"

Odin believe it, it'll leave your thumbs Thor!If 2018’s God of War was a tale about grief and the struggles of fatherhood in the face of loss, then this year’s sequel God of War Ragnarök is a tale about accepting the past and learning to let go for the sake of family.Much like Vin Diesel's Fast & Furious franchise, Ragnarök sees Kratos and Atreus bringing a band of friends, albeit almost inadvertently, together in order to face off against the story's big bad. In this instance, Thor, Odin and the end of the world itself.From its opening few minutes, Ragnarök makes it clear Santa Monica Studios came to play hard, throwing you into a hard-as-nails fight against the god of thunder himself – and what a delight it was to see him, and Norse mythology as a whole, represented in such a fresh and more memorable way compared to the MCU stylings we’ve been used to for the past few years.This isn’t a golden-haired hero. This is a mead-swilling tree trunk of a man, full of spite, vengeance and petty anger – the perfect villain.We won’t go into any spoilers or discuss too much about the characters because quite simply unfolding the story here is one of the game's biggest successes – but know that every character is compelling, with Odin being a favourite of ours to see just owning the screen.Ragnarök looks absolutely stunning, really flexing the PS5's muscles to deliver a smooth and gorgeous experience. Every axe swing and brutal finisher glosses the screen, while the worlds you explore offer a wide array of lush colours and stunning set pieces to feast your eyes on.The combat is as compelling as ever – your main arsenal is, of course, still your trusty Leviathan Axe and your Blades of Chaos, which can be upgraded as you go to learn new combos and devastating specialist strikes using the elements of ice and fire.The balance is perfect. Even if you’re not that skilled at parrying or laundry-list combos, anyone can produce a fierce chain of attacks that clear the battlefield in no time, looking so good you’ll have a sense of pride every time you take down a huge beast or swathe of dark elves. Related: The best God of War Ragnarök pre-order deals on PS5 and PS4If you’re a master of the parry and the ways of the axe, the harder settings offer a tougher challenge, forcing you to really consider your foes and surroundings in every fight. Have you got the best shield equipped for those perfect parries you’re pulling off? Are you wearing the right talisman to really make the most of your fighting style? There’s a lot of verticality and motion added to fights this time around too, as you’re able to grapple up around the map as well as pull enemies into you for some devastating first strikes, which add a whole new layer into fights which are already exhilarating and sometimes chaotic.Atreus, or whoever joins you on your explorations, has a few specialist attacks of their own to offer, which really help mix up the fights you’ll get into – from sonic arrows that stun and explode to relic enchanted attacks that supplement Kratos' moveset to add extra damage and range. There’s a lot to toy around with.You’ll no doubt find your favourites to use, but with so much to play around with, Ragnarök encourages you to mix it up without forcing it down your throat with constant on-screen prompts.One of the biggest complaints about Ragnarök's predecessor was the lack of enemy variety, something Santa Monica Studios has clearly taken on board as you’ll go toe to toe with a much larger and more unique array of enemy types, requiring a lot more strategy on the battlefield to take down without running low on health each time you draw a blade. Later into the game, you’ll feel the battles' intensity creep up, as enemies take longer to whittle down and their attacks do more damage.The challenge is definitely welcome, although it has to be said you may find the rhythm of fights feeling a bit more disparate on occasion as you have to manically unload special attacks and break enemy defences while being aware of unavoidable attacks coming from all angles. This can feel less like a teaching moment and instead an exercise in luck during a handful of encounters.These new specialist moves from partner characters don’t stop at the battlefield. They’ll also be key to you exploring your surroundings to the fullest and unlocking certain puzzles – which is great, as while Ragnarök is still a linear affair, each area you visit has a fairly wide berth for exploration, each with chests to find, Odin’s ravens to shoot down and relics to uncover.Something which we found quite refreshing after so many games offering huge open worlds with a host of carbon-copied ideas, Ragnarök offers a focused effort that you can choose to play straight through, or explore a little more, knowing there’s some meaningful treats at the end of the road – if not compelling stories to uncover – but thankfully not miles and miles of pointless marker following.Each area has its own side stories to tell, allowing you to uncover more about the world's history and characters. Taking the time not only fleshes out the universe you’re swinging your axe in, but lead to some of the most exhilarating boss fights in the game, testing our limits and keeping us gripped for more.Your enjoyment may vary with some of the puzzles, however, as they're not the most challenging puzzles on offer, though one or two did take us a moment to work out.Overall, it’s impossible not to love God of War Ragnarök, its characters endearing and  world ripe for exploration – with pounding, bombastic action at its core.Balancing a heartfelt story with over-the-top excessive video game action, Ragnarök is completely self-aware. It improves upon the previous title in all the ways we could have hoped for and delivers a huge experience with stunning visuals, beautiful storytelling and buckets of fun. This is a must have for any God of War fan and an easy recommendation for anyone new to the series.God of War Ragnarök is out on November 9 on PlayStation 4 and 5.

God of War Ragnarök,Agnese Carluccio,Wccftech,https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok-becoming-a-good-father/,"It's been just over four years since the God of War reboot came out, marking a real turning point in the epic of the Ghost of Sparta. The 2018 game set the stage for Kratos' journey in the Norse lands with a new and, in many ways, unexpected companion, his son Atreus.Seeing the bold Spartan in the guise of a father, in a tale where the cornerstone of the whole adventure is the relationship between Kratos and Atreus, thus departing from that relentless desire for revenge that pervaded the first chapters of the series, was indeed unforeseen. However, it also helped the series reach a whole new level of maturity, introducing fresh gameplay features and mechanics that made 2018’s God of War the masterpiece it actually is (and that we reviewed when it first came out as a PS4 exclusive), all combined with top-notch writing and direction. It is now up to God of War Ragnarok to take the saga’s reins and prove itself as the worthy successor of the 2018 installment.Kratos’s journey in God of War Ragnarok picks up a few years after its prequel. Fimbulwinter, a cold and never-ending winter that heralds the arrival of Ragnarok, has now fallen on the Nine Realms. Midgard is buried in snow, but that’s the price that father and son have to pay for their previous actions. The passing of time also had a certain effect on the protagonists. At this stage, Kratos isn’t solely an austere and relentless warrior but also a man who tries to be a better father and a reference point for his son. His actions aim to protect Atreus from the dangers the Nordic lands and their deities conceal, but he must also accept that the boy is no longer just a kid.Atreus has grown and is now struggling with adolescence and all the inner conflicts and doubts that come along with this age. He is ready to question his father's authority and willing to find out more about his origins and the meaning behind his other name, Loki. The boy wishes to start writing his own path but is often prey to his emotions, sometimes clouding his mind and judgment. On the other hand, Mimir continues to follow his friends during their journey across the Nine Realms, putting his vast knowledge at their disposal and managing to temper their spirits with the right words and a good dose of sarcasm.Obviously, Mimir won't be the only one to keep us company on our journey. Different old and new characters will cross the path of Kratos and Atreus, offering them their help and support in one way or another. And it is precisely this renewed trust in his allies, this connection that often hides behind some sort of friendship and not just a mere alliance out of convenience, that makes the story feel even more authentic, proving once again that video games can be a powerful medium.The real cornerstone of the story, however, is, once again, the relationship between Kratos and Atreus, which has been masterfully portrayed in the game by Santa Monica Studios’ writers with a more sensitive and mature approach than its predecessor. The Ghost of Sparta is finally aware that the son needs his guidance, and he must prepare him to face newfound difficulties and conflicts and the countless dangers that Fimbulwinter carries with it.Besides that, every other story in God of War Ragnarok is masterfully crafted to fit into a greater and bigger scheme. Each character we encountered during our journey had something to tell, from the co-protagonists to the different inhabitants of the Nine Realms. The plot has its own complexity that never feels like too much has been added to the game, but instead, it gives the impression that nothing has been left behind, unexplored. From the main path to secondary quests, there is so much to learn about friends, allies, and enemies, which is undoubtedly impressive considering the vast number of characters that God of War Ragnarok presents along the way. Nothing ever feels out of place or rushed, and every little thing just has its space in the story.Fans of Norse mythology will also be pleasantly amazed by the cast and the countless references to the Edda that this game can boast, although not every god has been added to Ragnarok for obvious reasons. The narrative rhythm is engaging and alternates stunning moments with instants of calm, useful for catching everyone’s breath and dedicating to less demanding, almost relaxing activities. There is not a single story that looks like it has been introduced just to add something more to the game, as everything connects toward the epic conclusion of this journey.The gameplay does not move away from the tested formula of 2018’s God of War. Ragnarok, however, introduces several notable additions that make a difference in the exploration and combat phases of the game. These improvements are nothing sort of revolutionary, but they certainly help consolidate and further evolve the already convincing formula of the reboot.Unlike the title’s predecessor, Kratos can now use the Leviathan Axe and Blades of Chaos from the beginning of the game, benefitting from a wide range of options during every combat. He can easily switch between the two weapons and use their respective abilities and elemental powers against enemies. The shield also covers a more central role in the gameplay, as it will not only serve as a defensive item but also as a powerful tool to charge foes, dealing damage to them and stun.Each weapon can be upgraded upon collecting specific items found while exploring the map or pursuing particular missions. Reaching the maximum level can be challenging, but a run with most of the secondary quests completed before the last bits of the game should grant you all the objects you need to be fully powered up. Weapons are also supported by their unique skill tree, giving players a massive amount of flexibility and the chance to choose their playstyle without missing anything.Armors also play a huge part in God of War Ragnarok. There are different sets to unlock while progressing in the game, each with unique characteristics and stats. Choosing the right build often makes a difference in combat, as different numbers directly impact the overall performance of the equipment. Moreover, armor pieces can also be upgraded, just like weapons. There are other great gameplay addictions that the game presents later on, which we won’t discuss now for the sake of keeping this review spoiler-free, but you will surely be more than happy to welcome them as you progress through the story.Atreus and other companions will support Kratos during the course of the adventure. The boy can count on his bow during combat, and the arrows can help stun enemies and solve specific environmental puzzles. Many battles can be approached by exploiting the verticality of the game areas or by interacting with particular items, such as large rocks or stone columns that can be thrown at nearby foes.Speaking of enemies, the variety of bosses has seen a step forward in the saga with Ragnarok, with many different foes that will try to kill Atreus and Kratos in every possible way. Each obviously has their set of skills, timings, attacks, and a proper analysis of their moveset before charging them or being able to break their guard, especially at more demanding difficulty levels. Standard enemies, although greatly designed and characterized in the title, may look and feel just a little repetitive in the long run as the protagonists get to meet diverse groups in different areas, maybe charged up with elemental attacks. Nothing that really affects the gameplay in a negative way, though.Each of the Nine Realms can be explored while progressing through the main story of God of War Ragnarok. Each area is masterfully designed, with its palette of colors, gradients, and unique elements that characterize the diverse spaces. The path that leads to completing the main task during quests is always dotted with secondary routes with additional enemies, mini-bosses, or chests that hide interesting treasures. Opening rarer crates frequently involves solving environmental puzzles, which adds more fun and a higher level of challenge to the game.As I said earlier, many combat encounters can be tackled by benefitting from the improved verticality of the game, which also impacts exploration. You will frequently find yourself carefully analyzing the area to find the right path that leads to the objective or toward a hidden chest. Many zones are also worth exploring more than once, as I have discovered different hidden regions while tackling secondary missions or simply wandering through the map. It took me about 50 hours to complete the main story and other additional activities and quests at medium difficulty. I guess the game can easily last more than 70 hours for anyone aiming at 100% competition.God of War Ragnarok also stands out on the technical and artistic front. Although it is clearly a cross-gen game, it can offer stunning visuals and majestic sceneries for each of the Nine Realms. Character and environmental models are skillfully crafted, with great care for even the smallest details. Ragnarok can be played by choosing between the different graphic options available on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 Pro, which involve preferring a higher frame rate over resolution or vice versa. On the standard PS4, there is only one available option, so there is no chance to modify this setting. However, the game runs smoothly, without any noticeable frame drop even on the older console, a clear sign that the optimization process carried out by Santa Monica Studios has been flawless.Reviewed on PlayStation 4 (code provided by the publisher).God of War Ragnarok is exactly what we hoped for, and even more. It offers a masterfully told story using a more mature approach, seasoned with a unique setting, a rich characterization of the characters, and challenges that can keep even hardcore gamers busy at the highest difficulties. In other words, it is a title that is simply just too good to be missed.Subscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox© 2023 WCCF TECH INC.

God of War Ragnarök,Jaz Sagoo,COGconnected,https://cogconnected.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok-review/,"In 2018, Santa Monica Studios made the bold decision to transform the iconic Ghost of Sparta. Past entries in the franchise evolved around his vengeful motives to slaughter the Greek Gods. With anger previously at the forefront of his persona, it was remarkable to experience his metamorphosis into a somber father. The evolution of his character and the contemporary interpretation of its gameplay set a new standard for the medium. Ragnarök aims to continue the growth of Kratos but will it manage to capture the magic of its predecessor?Repercussions of Kratos’ last adventure inflict his home. Due to the death of Baldur, Fimbulwinter has set upon the region, signaling the end of the world. With the hope of halting Ragnarök, father and son visit the nine realms in search of Asgardian forces to aid them in the war to end all wars. Due to the magnitude of the task, each step of the journey contains a looming sense of dread. Seeing the peace that the protagonists fought for at stake adds an intoxicating layer of tension that will keep you gripped throughout.The duo’s relationship is front and center of this epic journey, however, it has evolved. Atreus is now a teenager with a sense of adventure. While clear respect is shown for his father, he is more expressive than previously and desires responsibility. Due to this, he questions Kratos and takes the lead on several occasions. Mimir adds an interesting dynamic to the group. As an advisor, he guides the Marked Warrior on fatherhood which broadens Kratos’ views on how his descendant should behave. The way he subtly wrestles with his conflicting emotions on parenting adds further humanity to his character and makes him more relatable.Santa Monica Studio expertly merges the gameplay and narrative through its single-camera cinematography. You seamlessly transition in and out of story beats during your epic journey. Due to this, you quickly form a connection with the characters as you feel part of their quest. The weight of their worries rests on your shoulders too which aids engagement in the world and its lore.As you have access to both the Leviathan Axe and the Blades of Chaos early in the game, God of War Ragnarök’s combat includes more variety than its predecessor. Each weapon has its benefits and can help you take down certain creatures more efficiently. The Leviathan Axe is a powerful, close-quarters melee weapon that you can also throw at enemies and recall in a slick MCU-esque manner. A new addition is the ability to freeze your axe which results in stronger attacks that you can use to break armor and much more. The Blades of Chaos have a large area of attack which is particularly useful when you need to hold off a horde. With a swing of your chain, you can engulf your weapon with fire which can inflict significant damage to specific foes. Once you fill your meter through the evisceration of a number of creatures, you can also initiate God’s Fury. This highlights Kratos’ unbridled strength as you unleash a relentless barrage of strikes. With the ability to instantly combine these attacks with the arrows of Atreus, Kratos can conduct a glorious symphony of brutality on the battlefield.While the Ghost of Sparta is a large presence on screen with a hefty attack, he isn’t cumbersome. The visceral impact still remains with each satisfying swing of your weapon, however, he can also quickly evade oncoming attacks. You must read your opponent’s strike patterns and counter in order to emerge victorious. Roll out of the way of danger or use your shield’s strengths to get an advantage. The Stone Wall Shield allows you to absorb an onslaught and release a blast whereas the Dauntless Shield includes a risk/reward system that stuns enemies with a successful parry. This broadens the combat and allows you to further personalize your approach to conflict.Enemies are more varied this time around. You’ll instantly encounter creatures that will spit acid, bury themselves underground and much more. Because of this, you’ll have to use the full extent of your arsenal, especially if playing at the hardest difficulty. Bosses have always been a series highlight, and Ragnarök continues this trend. Each battle is an intense confrontation that perfectly captures the notion of Gods at war. Santa Monica’s signature cinematic flair shines in these segments to create some of the greatest moments in the franchise’s history.As you progress, you can unlock abilities for both Atreus and Kratos. The skill tree allows you to select a path for your character to benefit your preferred approach to fights. You are also given the option to customize your gear to create a build that suits you. Armour and weapon upgrades alter your stats in notable ways, so you can construct a character with a specific focus. Ragnarök finds the perfect balance with this by not including too many options to overwhelm but still also allowing you to personalize your experience. So whether you prefer a powerhouse, a tank or something else, the choice is yours.God of War Ragnarök flawlessly blends linear and open-world segments which creates a wonderful pace for your adventure. You are given the option to explore the environment to tackle side missions and discover secrets or continue to your main objective. If you choose to wander, you’ll discover well-designed, bespoke areas often with small puzzles which reward you with a range of items. Opposing this is the more linear sequences which include incredible cinematic action that progresses the narrative. These possess larger and more complex puzzles which beautifully juxtapose the frantic fights. The amalgamation of these many elements makes this a truly special experience.Missions are tracked on the Dwarven Compass so whether sailing, sledding or walking, you can easily veer toward whichever objective you please. With several realms to visit and a number of collectibles hidden within, it is easy to immerse yourself in this beautiful Norse world.The overall presentation of God War Ragnarök is second to none. Each environment feels distinct with architecture and plant life that add personality to the realm. The attention to detail is remarkable. Characters emit their personality through the lifelike animation which draws you into their quest. This is further enhanced through the spectacular sound design. Whether subtle or expansive, the score successfully communicates the tone of the situation. Every character is brought to life through stellar voice acting which captures the nuances of their disposition. The immersion continues with its use of haptic feedback. While its implementation adds a delicious visceral nature to combat, it’s the minor usage that lures you in which is impressive.God of War Ragnarök is a masterpiece. Even though the game maintains many elements that were established in its predecessor, it refines them to create an unforgettable experience. The quintessential storytelling is a highlight of the medium and its impeccable combat will keep you enthralled throughout. Although Santa Monica Studios set a high bar with their previous outing, Ragnarök soars above it.*** A PlayStation 5 key provided by the publisher ***Developer: Santa Monica StudioPublisher: Sony Interactive Entertainment"
God of War Ragnarök,Robert Ramsey,Push Square,https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/god-of-war-ragnarok,"GuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpGod of War Ragnarok2022 9.2Game RatingUser Ratings: 600Our Review: Scroll DownThe boy is back in townVersion Reviewed: EuropeanAt one point or another, Santa Monica Studio was thinking about spreading Kratos' new saga across three games — a trilogy that would mirror the original adventures of the vengeful god. This is worth bringing up because God of War Ragnarok feels like it could have been split in half and sold as two separate pieces. It absolutely dwarfs 2018's God of War in every possible way, and we dare say that other developers, and indeed publishers, may have pushed for that aforementioned trilogy given the sheer scale of this project.But no, Santa Monica Studio has delivered a game that makes its already excellent predecessor look like a prologue. So much happens in Ragnarok that by the time the credits roll, it's hard not to feel exhausted — in a good way. It's a truly tireless title in terms of creative vision, and we can only imagine the amount of effort that went into crafting such a beast of a game.That's not to say Ragnarok is some 200-hour monster, but it will take most players around 50 hours or so to see everything that's stuffed away in its impressively detailed world — and we'd estimate that around 30 of those hours are spent doing main story stuff. Again, though, it's the scope of the game that borders on mind-blowing — it's a title that's constantly one-upping itself. Just when you think you're closing in on some kind of conclusion, it whisks you off to something completely new, and the sense of wonder never really diminishes.But then this sequel did have a rock solid foundation to build upon. Structurally, it's very similar to Kratos' inaugural Norse excursion: you'll once again be journeying between distinct realms (all nine of them, it should be noted), traversing both linear and more open locations, which are home to a balanced mix of combat encounters and environmental puzzles. Some areas also play host to side quests, and, of course, loads of secrets.At a glance, you'd be forgiven for thinking that Ragnarok is just more God of War. Honestly, we were thinking the same during the game's opening hours, but it won't be long until your expectations are shattered. As it turns out, Sony has shown only a fraction of what Ragnarok has to offer — which is crazy in hindsight — and as such, we'd recommend going into this as blindly as you possibly can. Once the game's out, the internet will be rife with spoilers of all shapes and sizes — there are just that many surprises in store.Speaking of spoilers, we obviously won't be ruining anything in this review, but we will say that the main story is one hell of a ride. Set a couple of years after the events of God of War 2018, Kratos and his now teenage son Atreus find themselves in a bit of a rut. Midgard, the realm in which they live, is in the grip of a never-ending winter, and Kratos, all but paralysed with indecision, has Atreus do nothing but ""prepare"" for the inevitable sh*tstorm that lurks somewhere in their near future.It's a tense opening that soon explodes into action, and the plot just snowballs from that point on. The pacing is generally fantastic — even with plenty of quieter moments scattered throughout — and that's largely down to the game having a much more involved cast of secondary characters. Indeed, this is no longer just Kratos and Atreus' (and Mimir's) story, with the father-son duo assembling a ragtag group of allies as the plot progresses.As we've come to expect of a single-player Sony gig, the narrative presentation is of an incredibly high standard. Ragnarok continues with the first game's single-shot style of direction — and even manages to take it to dizzying new heights — while the title's talented motion capture and voice actors put in some superb performances. In particular, many of the interactions between main characters feel impressively organic for what is such a fantastical tale.Ragnarok is cinematic brilliance at times, but to say it's like a movie would be doing the title's top notch gameplay a severe disservice. As we mentioned earlier, everything is pretty much as returning players will remember it; instead of starting over, the developer has basically branched things out in all directions. Both in and out of combat, Kratos is given a range of new toys to play with, adding meaningful depth across the board. But even if you're unfamiliar with the first game, this sequel does an admirable job of introducing new bits and pieces at a steady, manageable rate.Combat has a similarly satisfying learning curve, even when taking Kratos' fresh options into account. Fights are still pleasingly visceral, with a bunch of new kill animations and attacks bringing yet more weight to an already punchy system. As was the case in 2018, the camera hangs close to Kratos' right shoulder, and so keeping track of your foes and making sure you aren't surrounded is key.While combat hasn't seen any significant changes on a fundamental level, increased enemy variety plays a massive part in making Ragnarok feel like a real step forward. New types of creatures are introduced all the time, and although a good chunk of them are repurposed from the previous game, a clear effort has been made to ensure that you're not just brawling with a slightly different group of decrepit draugr every five minutes.And then there are the boss battles. An overall lack of jaw-dropping bosses was one of the most common criticisms of the previous game, and so Santa Monica Studio has gone above and beyond with the big baddies this time around. There are more unique bosses in Ragnarok's first ten hours than there are in God of War 2018's entire runtime, and every single one of them is a highlight. A colossal improvement.It can't really be overstated just how many spectacular moments occur throughout this game. From the very start right through to the climactic finale, God of War Ragnarok just doesn't let up. Each part of the main story is a treat, with many highlights to choose from at every stage of the narrative. I'm not even just talking about big, jaw-dropping battles or huge story revelations — the game has many of those — I'm also talking about the quieter moments.Kratos and Atreus both grow as characters, and they're surrounded by an expanded (and wonderful) cast of allies and enemies. I won't spoil anything, but some of my favourite parts of the game are just conversations. The game has fun, meaty combat and oodles of space to explore, but I think I'm most impressed by the cinematics, the writing, and the acting. It's an immaculately presented game that kept me glued to the screen for hours at a time.While it's building on a pre-existing foundation from the previous title, you shouldn't let that diminish your hope for Ragnarok. It does feel pretty much the same to play, yes, but this sequel is so much larger, and the scope is so much grander, that any concerns about ""God of War 1.5"" will melt away fast.Stephen TailbyAssistant EditorOn the topic of improvements, the first game's somewhat divisive gear and levelling system is better implemented than it was before — but we're still not convinced that it adds anything of true worth to the experience. To quickly recap, this new God of War saga utilises equipment that can be upgraded with materials, with weapon and armour ranks contributing to Kratos' overall power level. A higher level means that you can take on tougher enemies with greater ease.The gear system is essentially a way of gating optional content. Levelling up gives you a reason to return to previously visited realms, claiming victory in fights that were once insurmountable. Design-wise, you can sort of understand the reasoning behind it, but it's just weird seeing Kratos struggle against a normal undead warrior because its level is higher and its health bar is a different colour. Even if levelled equipment adds a sense of progression, it just doesn't quite gel.Thankfully, we never once felt like we were locked out of main story progression because Kratos' loincloth wasn't up to snuff. By the game's final stretch, we had more than enough resources to deck Kratos out in high level gear several times over, and even if you avoid every slice of optional content, you're still handed equipment that's capable of getting you through the campaign. You'll obviously have a slightly tougher time of it, but that's just how it goes.A relatively minor complaint, then, and so here's another one: Ragnarok isn't quite the visual spectacle we wanted. Don't get us wrong, this is an exceedingly pretty game at times, but we'd argue that's mostly down to some sublime art direction, as opposed to the title's technical heft. In other words, you can tell this is a cross-gen release — it's not an immediately noticeable upgrade on 2018's instalment.That 60 frames-per-second on PS5 is immaculate, though. For us, the game's performance mode is the way to go — the action's just too good to settle for anything less — but there's also a 30fps option at a super crisp 4K resolution if you're willing to take the hit.The DualSense support is well worth a mention as well. Ragnarok feels fantastic to play on Sony's latest pad, forcing all kinds of haptic feedback based on your actions. It gives combat even more of a crunch, and helps sell Kratos' weighty movements when traversing environments. Meanwhile, cutscenes can be enhanced with a cheeky rumble here and there.God of War Ragnarok is phenomenal. Even amongst PlayStation Studios' typically stellar output it's a showpiece — a masterfully crafted game that smashes expectations at almost every turn. The sheer, often ridiculous scope of Ragnarok makes 2018's God of War feel like a prologue — and that's perhaps the highest praise we can bestow upon a sequel.Outstanding 10/10Scoring PolicyReview copy provided by Sony Interactive EntertainmentPlease note that some external links on this page are affiliate links, which means if you click them and make a purchase we may receive a small percentage of the sale.

When he's not practising combos, he's usually getting lost in the latest 100-hour RPG, or, y'know, replaying The Witcher 3.Comments (174)If anyone's got any questions just @ me and I'll try to answer them.I meant what I wrote in the review, by the way — the spoilers for this game are going to be insane, especially through YouTube thumbnails and the like. I would advise extreme caution if you want to go in blind, because there are a million things you could have spoiled in Ragnarok.Anyway, what an incredible game. I was already a big fan of the first one, and Ragnarok is basically just better in every conceivable way. It really goes above and beyond expectations. A ridiculous achievement.Thanks for giving the review a read.Games like this is why I will always be a PlayStation fan.LET'S BLOODY GOOOOOOOOAll i need is the score lol, thank you for reviewing!!@ShogunRok did the sequel expand on the enemy, weapon and combat variety of GoW4? While I didn’t feel like it was as lacking as many said it was in 4 I did feel like it wasn’t as expansive as it was in the previous 6 games so I would love to see GoW ragnarok to expand on those topics.There wasn't any doubt with SSM. Amazing! Wednesday can't come soon enough... actually... who was that retailer that broke street date again? 10 here and 10 on IGN already....wowCan't wait can't wait can't wait can't ***** wait. Few more days bois. We're almost thereWow! Lets do this!Sounds amazing. Whilst I didn't feel GoW 2018 was worthy of all the praise bestowed upon it, I get the feeling that this game very much will be deserving of its praise. Bigger, better and improved. Sounds like we have the God of War 3 of the Norse Saga. Can't wait to get stuck in.I don't really play videogames much anymore, but this game in particular has me more excited than any other has in recent memory. The cliffhanger ending at the end of GoW 2018 had me on tenterhooks and now I can finally play what looks to be one of the most amazing conclusions of all time?! What can I say to that other than WORD UP SON!The hype is real. Just starting to replay GOW 2018 now, hopefully I can finish it before Wednesday. Can't wait!@ShogunRok how many hours does it take you to finish main story and do everything ?This game will be the best of the generation again. The only complain I have are the graphics.. the 2018 title still holds up but I was expecting a BANGER and an upgrade in every possible way. F*ck ps4@darkswabber Yes, massively improved variety in enemy types and especially bosses. Probably the game's biggest improvement, objectively speaking.Can't say im surprised at all. Honestly impressed how they managed to pull this off twice in a row. And this time during Covid as well.@MichaelHawj My save was at 46 hours when I wrote this review. I had done everything apart from one or two side quests, one being finding all of Odin's ravens (I have 30-something out of 48).@4kgk2 my thoughts exactly. No matter what other companies offer, they most certainly don't have games like God of War so as long as they keep making such quality titles, I'll continue to game on playstation consoles.Oh boy, I'm so excited for this!Best DLC ever 😉@ShogunRok Great review, loved to read it. These couple more days are gonna take forever after reading this. Cant wait till next week!@MightyDemon82 possibly longest, too, haha.I knew this game would be greatSounds fantastic. I finally played the 2018 one last summer for the first time and was really blown away. Can't wait to get my mitts on this one.Another god of war masterpieces.god of war ragnarok is indeed excellent.my favorite franchise ever.and grand theft auto.a 10 is legendary.word up sonThis game is absolutely insane! Santa Monica Studio has kept SO MUCH SECRET, you really have no idea what you're about to experience.It's a masterpiece for sure!@jrt87 Implies we give out 10s like candy, however it's our first of the year. In fact, the only other 10 we've awarded to a PS exclusive on PS5 is Demon's Souls.The game's just that good.Absolutely cannot wait! Thanks for the review (and that lovely second opinion bit).Did we expect anything less.Just saying that this game makes the 2018 game look like a prologue sold the game for me. I enjoyed the game to a point in didn't want it to end when it did so hearing that this one is way longer is perfect.@ShogunRok Have you tried the ps4 or ps4 pro versions?BOOM, there it is!10/10Hyped!!!Who called this DLC? Consider my ticket bought, boy...I knew this would review well but I didn't think it would review as well as it has. The review roundup is pretty crazy. Can't wait to play this!@belmont I haven't, but we do plan on trying to PS4 version before launch and writing something up, so keep an eye out!@naruball definitely, I cannot wait to get my hands on this. All those armies of people who aren't going to play it because it's a cross gen title(or is that just trickydicky1999 😂) will miss out.Even more hyped now. Wednesday 9th can't come soon enough. Trying my absolute best to avoid spoilers, so far so goodOh boiiii. Here we go again! Now a week to avoid spoilers like it’s COVID.LET'S GOOOOOOO BOI.I can't wait for Tuesday night <3I'll wait for the inevitable PS+ release or when it drops to around £10, as that's how much a PS4 game is worth 2 years into a new genI recently got back on the PS5 bandwagon with the EE add to plan thing so got £200 of PSN vouchers, first of all I had to preorder Resident Evil 4 and now reading this review I think God of War has to be my next purchase.I did enjoy the last one, not quite as much as many seem to though it is a good game, kind of like an old school Zelda with much better combat and I did enjoy the story. I've recently left Twitter so spoilers will be easy for me to avoid and this and the PSVR2 preorder will be my last gaming purchases of the yearExcellent review, now I can finally pre-order the game👌👌👍👍@ShogunRok which graphic mode did you opt for?Also, nice review man. Looking forward to this one.@ShogunRok If you were stranded on a desert island for 5 years with barely any food, would you recommend playing this on the rescue plane flight home? Or would you rather eat until you can’t eat anymore?Seems good from the review - Pre order was already in and downloaded today.HFW got a nice review but when I played it for me, it was too much of ""more of the same""This review suggests its again more of the same but with proper bells and whistles it deserves. Looking forward to getting stuck in.@ShogunRok and, without going into spoilers (obviously), what about weapon variety and action set pieces?@Weebleman I went with the 60fps performance mode. Rock solid throughout, not sure it ever dropped a frame. Resolution is still quite high as well, so I think the trade-off for 60fps is well worth it considering how action packed the game is.@SoulChimera Haha, why not? Might as well get some top quality gaming in for free and then stuff yourself with food once you touch down in civilisation.@darkswabber Loooooads of action set pieces, some really good ones. A lot of the boss battles are unique in that they use the environment in different ways, and things like that. Combat-wise, it's much expanded on GoW 2018 across the board.Expected 9/10, pleasantly surprised with the review. Can't wait to get my dirty paws on it.@ShogunRok Did you get a chance to try the unlocked framerate modes, specifically the high quality?I have read that some got around 70-90 fps with the performance unlocked, which worries me that the High quality unlocked may not even regularly reach 60?Dammit. Now I'll have to preorder this too 😞 sucks to be a Playstation owner when we're constantly subjected to incredible experiences like this.@KundaliniRising333 Sadly not, I don't have a TV that supports HFR. Very interested in seeing how it runs myself, though.@ShogunRok No worries, thanks for your efforts.What about any discernible difference in visual fidelity between performance and quality modes (aside from resolution).I honestly was not even that excited for this but it seems like its going to be astounding. Probably gonna have to be a day 1 for me now the response seems overwhelmingly positive from trusted reviewersWow, the God is back! The reasons why I love Sony studios.As excited as I am for this game, I’m absolutely glad I’ve made the decision to wait until I’m done with The Callisto Protocol and Dead Space. I REALLY want to be able to soak into and thoroughly enjoy both of those games as well as GOW: Ragnarok and since Ragnarok is as (apparently) long as it is there’s just no way I’d be able to fit it in between TCP & DS. Heck, maybe I’ll get lucky enough to catch it on sale by the time I’m ready for it.I’ll definitely buy after a few price cuts, I’m swimming in backlog! 😉@KundaliniRising333 I didn't notice a huge difference between performance and quality, but quality is very, very crisp at a native 4K. Really pops.But it's still not a trade I'd make if it means 30fps. There's so much action in this that I'd always play at 60fps purely for the responsiveness.@PlayStationGamer3919 Ragnarok has waaaaaaay more boss battles and loads of them are unique. It's a gigantic improvement on the first game.There are some repeat boss battles, but most are optional.I'm pre-ordering it tomorrow. For sure it will be a must play, a game for the ages.Great review! I can't wait to dive into this!@4kgk2 yeah, just read a comment on youtube review of it, a guy saying ps only had 1 game lol, and xbox is better, good lord...
Sony isn't perfect maybe and some can criticize them on some things but..
Some clueless will say anything.Sorry, I stopped watching after you said ""and such.. we recommend going into this as blindly as you possibly can."" See ya November 9th, boy.I'm glad to be dusting off the PS5 for this. 2nd place console this gen for me but Sony still makes must play games. I'm happy for this to be GoW 1.5 as some are saying. If it matches GoW in game play and polish but built on the story I would have been happy. Seems it does much more than just build on the story so looking forward to next weekend.Thanks for the great review. I really like the second opinion concept.Good for the fans, I suppose. I tried the one from 2018 and really disliked it; Won't be picking this one up either.Bit strange though; I know reviewers always get games a few days earlier, but doesn't this one release, like, a full week from now?Maybe it's just me though.Was there any doubt?Who else was surprised when Kratos pulled out the Sword of Olympus?@Mauzuri Review embargos are different for every product. Some people believe it's a bad sign if the embargos are really close to the release because it's a possible sign that it's a bad product and that the directors or creators don't want the reviews to affect the sales. So if they lifted the embargo long before the game's released, to me, that means the game developers are confident in their product and want us to get hyped for it.Great Review... TYAt this point there is no reason top IPs cant be Amazing Games AND Look Stunning.Sony understands I expect both for my money. And constantly delivers.Ok then. I am going offline till I get the disk delivered. I do not want any spoilers hitting me from nowhere @Sergo Good idea! You'll love it!Not reading the review as i don't need to, never had doubts so hurry up next week.Put my pre-order in this morning from Best Buy. Already have the Limited Edition Dualsense controller pre-ordered also. Now I just have to wait until Wednesday and avoid spoilers. My backlog will keep me busy until then.Can't wait for this!!!!! Will no doubt be my GoTY!Still slowly playing through the first one. Lol Man, this game sounds really good and fun to play. Sadly, I’ll probably wait for a deep discount.Great review...was it ever seriously in doubt? Time to swing that Leviathan Axe and unwrap those Blades of Chaos!!!The only PS4 games I liked better than God of War 2018 were Yakuza 0 and Resident Evil 2 remake. Can't wait to play this next week, been avoiding as many gameplay videos as possible. Only reason I read this review is because this place is good about avoiding spoilers.@ShogunRok Thanks, I will look forward to it. I don't have access to my ps5 due to work travels and ps4 is more easy mo move around and I would like to play the game soon...Schedule my vacation from work around this game lol. I can't wait!@eshy76 and hopefully bash some heads in with MjolnirEasy buy! Wasn't sure on disc or digital, but £37 via the Turkish store is a no brainer.Very good review and i'm even more hyped for this to arrive..really good comments section for once as well and i gave almost everyone a like..almost everyone..👍Okay, I was gonna wait for a sale or something but I think I'm gonna have to swallow the full price at this rate.@ShogunRok Yeah, ER and GOW:R in the same year...It's great! We have a recession to get through, this will help a little bit!Think I'll wait for the inevitable PC release as 4K at 30FPS doesn't appeal. Congrats to Santa Monica Studio to what looks likes a cracking game though!@ShogunRok to be honest, I thought the first one was quite dull. I'm open to giving this a go but if gameplay and level design are similar is it going to win anyone over?@LIMAMaybe but having 60fps is a must imo.Or just wait for a PS5 pro and go for more gfx at 60fps for GOW 6.Nice! Better than Dragon Age Inquisition, though??@jrt87 I dont want to that guy but it's just not true that every firstparty title gets high ratings and kind of a ridiculous remark.@jamiestogden Hmmm, that's a tough one. I think if you weren't a fan of the first game, then this probably won't win you over, because structurally and mechanically, it's very, very similar — it's just everything is expanded.It is packed with improvements over the first game, though. The pacing is better and there are better fights throughout (with way more boss battles).Hard to recommend if you disliked GoW 2018, I think, but perhaps worth a shot when it drops in price down the line.Boom boom boom!But please don't port it to pc so fast, give it at least a couple of years please!I don't think we expected anything less from Santa Monica, they have an incredible team over there that only push out quality.I do feel a bit bad for Horizon 2 as is probably not going to win anything with Elden Ring and now this excellent GOW sweeping everything everywhere.@ShogunRok Are collectibles easier to find this time around?Excellent review. Got me even more hyped if that's possible.@Peterchu I would say so, yes. There are still Ravens to find and a few other things, but they're generally harder to miss. You still might need a guide for a few that you don't find, but yeah, easier overall.Oooh, wasn't going to buy this at launch, as I've got other games on my plate, but this has given me a big decision to make!Regardless of score, verdict etc, it's a pleasure to read such a gleefully enthusiastic review, about a game which was so clearly enjoyed from start to finish. Cheers for this.Currently 94 on meta critic and there are a very large number of 100s, more than I ever remember seeing before. ShogunRok was bang on the money with this excellent review.If anyone wants a spoiler free 30 minute video, I highly recommend skillups YouTube review. That guy is the best wordsmith covering games right now and that review is a shining piece of work.Obviously, he's the best after pushsquare (phew, dont want to offend!)Great review, I have dropped some very unsubtle hints for crimbo to anyone who will listen, fingers crossed!!My main concern would had been combat, in 2018 it was the same tactics for pretty much everything and with the lack of bad guy variety, I wasn't enjoying the combat during end game.Great there's some new bad guys!For Sparta!!It sounds like they improved on my biggest issue with the original which was enemy variety so that is very good to hear! Sounds like the armor system is still kinda meh though unfortunately. I'm also a bit worried about the length being too long but we will see.Looking forward to playing it next week!Great review, cant wait to play the game 😍@ShogunRok are there multiple trophies for each difficulty to complete multiple playthrough ??3rd game is gonna be the weakest and suffer from the third curse@MichaelHawj No, I don't think so. My Trophy completion is at 90% and I've done basically everything aside from a couple of side quests — which I assume will give me the last Trophies. It's very much a modern PlayStation Studios Trophy list in that you basically just have to do everything in one playthrough to get the Platinum.@redd214 10/10 👯‍♂️@ShogunRok thank bro@jrt87 lol salty much smh trying to insinuate it’s only a 10 because it’s a ps exclusive. It’s a 10 because that’s just the quality Sony first party studios consistently deliver that’s why imo their the best in the business@get2sammyb yeah that was a ridiculous claim by that user although this really should have been the third ps5 exclusive to get a 10 because HFW was that good and easily deserved it but I forgive that transgression Removed - trolling@jrt87 So you think the 10 should be a 9 based on not playing it vs the people who did play it? You haven't played it yet so you can't give it anything.@ShogunRok i would like to ask, are we going to explore the same areas of the realms we've already been before in gow2018 or is it going to be new areas of those previous realms?(Im aware there's 3 new realms but just wanted to know about the previous ones)Thanks for the review! I already have the game pre-ordered, just waiting and hoping that Best Buy delivers it to me by Friday, November 11.@EquiinoxGII the Turkish store????@dark_knightmare2 HFW is a snorefeast compared to this game I'm sure.  And I platinumed HFW.@nomither6 Probably won't be a third one, not in this series anyway. Maybe a spinoff or something, who knows.Sounds the goods again,no live service cashcow, so good enough for what I'm looking for...& Eurogamer (again),can only manage a recommended rather than the essential they usually give on other formats so must be good!!🙄😂@ShogunRok is there an equivalent in this game to fighting the valkyrie queen optional bossI'm glad it turned out well for everyone who's excited, including some of my mates who won't shut up about it haha.I'm gonna save this for Xmas. I probably would have given in and got this today if Bayonetta 3 hadn't turned out the better game😜I never would have thought Bayo 3 would've trumped Elden Ring and probably this for my game of the year, but here we are.@jordan1992 haha yeah mate. It sells for 799lira, about £37/38Was always worried this couldn't build on the original release. Looks like I didn't need to worry though!Pre ordered the console game bundle, just wish it was like the US version with black logo plates and controller skin.i would advise EVERY GAMER to AVOID the internet days before release. There are trolls that won't respect gaming ethics and protocol and SPOIL the game. If you are a real gamer and love your community and brothers and sisters PLEASE don't leak information or footage if you can. lets all GO IN BLIND and enjoy the game. This world is a crazy place, lets relax and go somewhere and forget things for a while..@gamer_since_83 there is a thing called DLC, which could expand hungry fans. Im not adversed to any of that my friend. But if this game stands on the shoulders of its predecessor, i won't be mad at all..I'm totally sold. Gonna replay GoW 2018 this wkend@gamer_since_83 oh I wasn’t comparing them to each other just saying how great HFW was. I never got tired fighting those machines it was always a rush especially against the bigger ones never a snore fest to me@jrt87 euro gamer has been a joke for awhile now and both their horizon reviews were way off. There was nothing restricting about HFW open world, it had the best sidequests in an open world game since Witcher 3 and it’s story was def not uninteresting far from it. There’s a reason it reviewed extremely well and continues to sell because it’s a great game.@jrt87 you got called out because your comment is ridiculous and it was asinine to post. It’s not like this was the only site to give it a 10 it’s got like 40 others so are those 40 sites giving it a 10 for the same reason. Games especially sequels don’t have to innovate to get a 10 especially the first sequel to a game who just changed up almost every thing about itselfOh no, I’m not going through this again.@Randinator123 You do return to some specific areas, but the coming of Ragnarok has changed them all in some way. For example, recurring areas in Midgard are now covered in snow and ice.The vast, vast majority of the game takes place in completely new locations, though. No copy and pasting here!@Ultrasmiles Yes, there are a lot of optional bosses, including ones that are meant to be fought at the end of the game because they're so tough, like the Valkyrie queen in the first game.@EquiinoxGII wat’s the Turkish store??@jordan1992 PSN Turkey store.@jrt87 The issue people have is you're basically saying a game you haven't played yet doesn't deserve a 10. If you played it and thought this way it would be different but you haven't played it so really you don't know what you're scoring it, you could play it and actually feel its a 10 but you could also not even like it and feel its a 4. PushSquare like all the other reviewers have actually played it and completed it so if they feel its a 10 then they feel its a 10.Also this is the first PS5/PS4 game since DS Remake to score a 10 from PS so your theory of it only getting a 10 because its 1st party holds no weight.@EquiinoxGII i don’t know wat that is???@jordan1992 the online store you have on your playstation... But the Turkish version not the UK version.@jrt87 I'm not saying 9/10 is bad but you're judging a score on a game you haven't played and even applying a score yourself. I don't agree or disagree with the 10/10 because i haven't played it.@jrt87 By Admission of its reviewers it's a masterpiece and an excellent experience in all aspects.,It's part 2 of a saga and you want them to change the core of the game,when so much has been added already,So much has not been shown.Come on son you cherry pick comments that it's more of the same which is false,but don't acknowledge 40 plus perfect scores. Because of your ignorance you don't deserve to play this game.This game could be released on every console and it would still get a 10,nothing to do with being an exclusive. go back to fortnite for the good of all..@ShogunRok I don’t need to know specifics (because you can’t tell me them) but how much does Ragnarok undo your progress? In god of war 2018 you build you build yourself up with Armour weapon upgrades, new items, new arrows skill trees and  The blades of chaos. How much of this get undone in Ragnarok? Do you end up back at square one trying to rebuild yourself as you were in 201 or does progress feel continued from the ending of 2018? Basically does the game treat you like an inexperienced First timer or doerit expect you to have played 2018Also is Give me god of war more fair at times. In 2018 it really feels like the difficulty wasn’t perfectly tuned to the opening before you get certain abilities like lightning arrows.@EquiinoxGII does that work? Would the game not be in Turkish??@jordan1992 yes mate, bought quite a few games from the store. All in English. If you know of hotdeals UK, you can find loads of info on the site/app about games from the Turkish store.@Eagly You do have to start over in Ragnarok, but not from scratch. You get access to both of Kratos' weapons very early, and you unlock a lot of the attacks from the last game early as well, through the new skill trees.So while you are having to retread a lot of ground, it doesn't necessarily feel like you're being made weak again. You feel super strong right from the start here, and that's mostly down to how combat encounters are designed. There's a really nice difficulty curve overall.If you're familiar with 2018, you'll be able to dive right in here, but it also does a great job of gradually introducing new combat elements for people who might not have played the last one, or haven't played it in years.Can't speak too much for Give Me God of War — was only briefly able to try the different difficulties because I had to get through the game in a relatively short amount of time.The harder settings did seem quite brutal (as they were in 2018), but I unfortunately don't know how much they've been reworked.I will say, though, that the combat balance throughout did feel better. That should hopefully carry through to the harder modes as well.I just wanted to give a little praise to the quality of the review. I always enjoy reading a good review, no matter if the game is for me or not. Just one of the reasons why i come back to this site. I'm sure it's a 10, but honestly I can't see me play this before 2025...@solocapers more of the same but better is exactly what a sequel is supposed to be. sequels just might not be for you@gamer_since_83 you didn't platinum anything stop the cap. horizon is great@middyone what are you talking about…? I hope this isn’t an insult, Boy!?  Oh, and I’m free to think Horizon is boring, both of them actually! Still platted both.@middyone The problem with HFW is that it wasn't actually any better.I'd still rate HZD as the better of the two.@gamer_since_83 take it as you want boy. you obviously enjoyed it...don't lie. otherwise you wouldn't had platinumed it.@solocapers it was better in every way and it wasn't even close. nostalgia is a hell of a drug@middyone way to talk, as if you know me. I was in mourning at the time actually. The game (HFW)was boring to me but an easy Platinum, so I went for it since I bought the game. The first one I got free on PS+ and platinumed it sitting at home with a broken ankle at the time. Try again, smart ass! Or not …@gamer_since_83 if you're referring to boy then you did it first. so you were mourning while playing a game? no wonder why you didn't like it. also sorry for your loss. so you play games for platinum lol. I will.@ShogunRok Thank you. It’s reassuring@middyone you are not worth it …Don’t crucify me for saying this, but I never finished the 2018 version. Grad School, plus my gaming ADD, guaranteed that I would not complete the journey.  That being said, do I need to go back and finish that one before I enter into this one?@gamer_since_83 not worth what?@placekicker yes@placekicker Don't know how necessary it is but even if it wasn't I'd still recommend going back to finish GoW 2018 just because it's a fantastic game.After this I don't wanna hear anyone doubt playstation sequels as some afterthought DLCCant wait to play! Im gonna hold off so my wife has something to buy me on Christmas that i'm legit beyond excited for. hopefully no spoilers till then!HYPED!!!!!!I wanted to comment just ‘hyped’ but pushed square won’t let meThe game sounds amazing, I’ll pick it up after Christmas probably, although I am slightly put off by the idea of more puzzles… -_-@playstation1995 Totally agree and can't wait for it to drop but c'mon GTA was once great but it's cold product that sells on it's name these days.@Blackbluto gta is still amazing.i enjoy all the gta games.word up son@ShogunRok hey tanks for the review !! Just got one question, how is the 3D audio implementation ?? Is it noticable ?? Or at least we have more options then the first game (stereo)@SilkySmile89 The audio design is really good, great use of sound effects in general, and there's a nice depth to it. I don't have a lot of experience with the 3D audio support in particular, but I've been told it's very well implemented. Not completely amazing, but still effective.@Wowdustnew I’m the same mate! She said she was buying me Mod Warfare 2, GoW Ragnarok an Calisto Protocol. I went an bought Mod Warfare 2 myself, told her i must have pre ordered it ages ago an forgot! I’ve promised i won’t buy any more games until after Xmas!!Why is this more expensive on PS5?? Are some haptics and visual modes worth the extra?My main concern is that it doesn't appear to be a huge step up comparative to 2018, barring the scope. It's not like I can complain about more God of War, especially given that stellar showing in the reboot, but few updates to the combat and apparently only bare improvements with respect to the graphics? Maybe I was just expecting a little too much but this is more what I'd consider common for annual or biannual releases.Besides this, I'm pretty excited to try it out. Been waiting to see how this saga ends for what feels like a lifetime now.With Sony touting new game demos on PS Plus Premium, think we’ll see one for this at launch?Graphics are a bit of a let down for 2022, world textures and geometry details are a bit low, looks like a good PS4 pro game but at higher frame rate. Ps5 is really disappointing in terms of graphics power. And as Time goes on it gets worse and worse, at launch it was acceptable, now it's just shameful IMOis this game getting any DLC content?Levelling system is still pantsIts good but its no where near a 10.I was worried this game was going to be a ""samey"" sequel, but after 40 hrs in (playing in hardest difficulty), this definitely exceeded all expectations.

God of War Ragnarök,Henry Yu,Gaming Nexus,https://www.gamingnexus.com/Article/7718/God-of-War-Ragnarok/,"Video games are a pivotal and influential form of art that grow ever more prominent with advancements in technology. They serve as a contemporary interactive medium for passionate creators to share the fruits of their imagination. Some focus on telling a compelling story, displaying in-depth gameplay mechanics, or showing off visually stunning cinematics, but very few are able to achieve excellence in all categories to make up a complete experience. Sony Santa Monica Studio's 2018 reboot of God of War is one such game, taking everyone by surprise and becoming the genre defining game of the last generation. It was lauded in many circles as Game of the Year for its endearing narrative, fleshed out combat system, and just about everything else. Since then, the weight of the world has been on the shoulders of the developers for the long awaited sequel God of War Ragnarök. The question on everyone’s mind is: does it measure up to the bar set so high by God of War (2018)? No, Ragnarök doesn’t measure up to it, but instead greatly exceeds expectations. The highly anticipated continuation of Kratos and Atreus’s journey not only expands on the many combat and puzzle systems established by the former, but continues to effortlessly deliver an emotional narrative adventure filled with twists and turns. Not to mention that the dazzling gorgeous graphics, outstanding soundtrack and voice cast, and excellent performance make the overall experience phenomenal. As a quick refresher, God of War is a third person action adventure game set in the realm of Norse mythology. You will no longer be seeing the pantheon of Greek Gods like Zeus or Athena as you did in the older games, but instead will come face to face with the likes of Thor and Odin. And no, they are not at all the heroes as they are portrayed as in the Marvel movies. The Gods in these mythologies were terrible beings doing despicable deeds, and it’s refreshing to see Sony Santa Monica Studio portraying them in a more accurate light. God of War (2018) ended with the protagonists killing Baldur, the Norse god of light and purity, and consequently kicking off Fimbulwinter. God of War Ragnarök immediately picks up where the previous game left off, showcasing some amazing set pieces and performances from a cast made up of both returning characters and new ones. I am ecstatic to see Christopher Judge and Sunny Suljic reprise their roles as Kratos and Atreus, as they both pour their heart and soul into portraying these characters. The single-shot camera makes a return, allowing for a truly immersive experience that seamlessly transitions between combat and cinematic sequences. However, crawling through tight spaces, squeezing through cracks, and walking in the Realm Between Realms still disguise loading screens. It was a point of criticism for the first game, but one that I have no qualms over, considering loading screens are inevitable. God of War Ragnarök is still a cross generational game, available on both PlayStation 4 and 5, so it’s understandable it was not built from the ground up with next-gen in mind. Performance on the PlayStation 5 is unparalleled, with ultra fast load times from a clean launch of just a few seconds. Two graphical models are offered: one that favors resolution at 4K 30FPS and one that favors performance at dynamic resolution 60FPS. The framerate can be unlocked and boosted to 40FPS for resolution mode and up to 120FPS for performance mode with an HDMI 2.1 cable and on monitors that support 120hz refresh rate. The visuals are exquisite, even in performance mode, featuring crisp, photo-realistic depictions of characters and environments. Likewise, an entire suite of accessibility options is also available to allow anyone from any background to enjoy this game.You are able to travel to nine realms in God of War Ragnarök, whereas the first game only allowed six. Note that Asgard and Jotunheim are not accessible outside of main story segments, but you do get to explore both in great detail. Since this game marks the end of the Norse Saga for the God of War franchise, it makes sense that Ragnarök would be packed full of content. My first playthrough took around 25 hours, with some side favors completed, but a lot left to be discovered. My difficulty was set to Give Me Balance (the middle/normal difficulty), and the game was already quite difficult during some fights. Your playtime could be significantly higher on harder difficulties, and yes, Give Me God of War difficulty is back. There are plenty of optional activities to partake in, including endgame bosses and post-game quests. The franchise has never before seen so much enemy variety, from nasty Helwalkers and Draugrs to Einherjar warriors and gigantic wyverns. The first 30 minutes of Ragnarök contain more variety than the entirety of the previous game.The only semi-open world area in 2018’s God of War was at the Lake of Nine where you could ride a boat to explore, whereas the rest of the game was mostly linear. I’m glad to say that nearly every single realm in this sequel, whether that be in the new realms of Svartalfheim and Vanaheim or the familiar lands of Midgard and Alfheim, has large nonlinear open areas for you to venture through. You are always rewarded for drifting off the beaten path, including getting more hacksilver, a new runic ability, or a Nornir chest containing an Idunn Apple or Horn of Blood Mead. Even those annoying Odin ravens that you spent over ten minutes trying to shoot down with your axe now reward you with special armor instead of some measly experience points. Unfortunately, there is no New Game Plus mode at launch, but here’s to hoping the developers add it later on like they did with the 2018 God of War. Photo mode is confirmed to be coming post launch for free, so get ready to take some shots of the beautiful landscapes across all the realms. Cutscenes are indeed unskippable on your first playthrough, but why would you want to skip this masterpiece storytelling?Those who played God of War (2018) will feel right at home with the combat system here. All of the basics are there with your trusty Leviathan Axe and Blades of Chaos. You are sure to remember light, heavy, normal, and runic attacks, rage mode, parrying, and commandeering Atreus to shoot his arrows. The folks at Sony Santa Monica Studio have established a solid foundation for combat from the first game and expanded it extensively in God of War Ragnarök. Kratos still can’t jump, but there is much more verticality introduced in combat encounters, with arenas that span multiple layers, allowing Kratos to swing between platforms or crash down from above with a slam attack. Much more of the environment can also be utilized in battle, with large rocks and trees that Kratos can rip out of the ground to throw at incoming enemies. These improvements may not sound like much by themselves, but goes a long way into adding immersion and versatility to fighting.Perhaps the greatest surprise to the gameplay part of this game is that Atreus is a fully playable character, with his own unique moves and abilities. I might be the odd one out, but I actually enjoyed playing as Atreus more than Kratos, as he is much more nimble than his father. There’s an entire fleshed-out skill tree for him that includes a grapple hook to pull you in towards enemies, and the ability to slow down time on a perfect dodge or parry. You still play as Kratos for the majority of the game, but just seeing how polished and fun it is to play as Atreus was enough to put a smile on my face. I kind of wish that you could switch between them interchangeably at any point, but I’ll take what I can get. Companions have also been greatly revamped compared to the first game. Atreus won’t be your only sidekick anymore as various characters step in and out, acting as companions during combat encounters depending on the story progression. These companions include both Sindri and Brok, our beloved Dwarven brothers. The AI controlling these companions is also much more intelligent than last time, actively participating in fights and reacting to your moves.Okay, so now that the cat’s out of the bag about Atreus being playable, what’s new with Kratos? Well, he gets an electrifying new toy in his arsenal, the Draupnir Spear. Not only does this spear add another layer of depth to combat; it also ties in seamlessly with the events of Ragnarök. Kratos now has three extensively crafted weapons at his disposal, along with a reworked shield system. His rage meter can now be utilized for an empowered attack on one weapon as a heal. In the previous game, Kratos only has the Guardian Shield, gifted to him by his late wife Faye. Thanks to Sindri and Brok, Kratos can now equip different shields that each have a unique ability. Do you favor blocking or parrying more? Perhaps you enjoy bulldozing your way through enemies with a powerful shield bash. Now there’s a shield that specializes in each of those. All of these new tools have allowed more complexity and depth to the puzzles as well. You are frequently dropped into situations that require you to use both Kratos and Atreus’s abilities to light those Nornir Chest pillars or open a locked gate.I can’t speak much about the narrative due to spoilers, but I can confidently say that the writing is exemplary. It’s rare to see characters, both main and side, be so multidimensional. Most depictions in this medium are usually one-note, but the writers at Sony Santa Monica Studio have truly gone above and beyond. There’s just so much color and life in these characters that I felt like it would be easy for me to befriend and strike up a conversation with them even though they exist in a fictional universe. I can wholeheartedly say that I thoroughly enjoyed meeting all the characters, and was surprised to be so invested in a few of them. God of War Ragnarök grapples with the concepts of relationships, violence, vengeance, and justice, told through incredible attention to detail in both the dialogue and environment. I felt whole spectrum of emotions throughout this entire experience, from anger and resentment to laughter and tears. And that’s not something I can say for many games.There’s something special here with God of War Ragnarök. It’s more than just a video game – it’s an entire journey that transcends the modern day gaming experience with its masterful amalgamation of so many different working pieces. I’m looking forward to continuing to discover all the secrets that the nine realms hold while I ponder the themes of the narrative.Sony Santa Monica Studio has created another masterful work of art, going above and beyond with world-class storytelling, in-depth combat mechanics, exquisite visuals, unparalleled performance, and a slew of modern accessibility features. God of War Ragnarök continues the endearing journey of father and son in a grand spectacular finale of the Norse Saga. This is the game of the generation.* The product in this article was sent to us by the developer/company. View Profile"
God of War Ragnarök,John-Paul Jones,PlayStation Universe,https://www.psu.com/reviews/god-of-war-raganrok-review-ps5/," John-Paul Jones / November 3, 2022God of War: Ragnarok PS5 review. When I first heard the title ‘Ragnarok’ I was immediately fearful for what that would mean for not just God of War’s Norse setting, but the various characters and personalities that I had gotten to know and love in the 2018 release. With additional confirmation that God of War: Ragnarok indeed marks the endpoint for the adventures of Kratos in Norse mythology, it’s certainly fair to say that my anxiety spiked – would Sony Santa Monica be able to not just create a better game than 2018’s Game of the Year, but could the legendary studio also tie up all the loose ends and create a fitting conclusion to God of War’s sojourn into Norse mythology? Yes, yes they did and in doing so have carefully crafted what amounts to the perfect sequel and one of the best games of the last decade.To be completely clear, God of War: Ragnarok is a direct sequel to 2018’s God of War in absolutely every way that you can imagine. Though a number of adjustments have been made to the traversal and combat, God of War: Ragnarok really is ‘God of War 2018 Part 2′ and plays extremely similarly in terms of traversal, combat, exploration and puzzle solving. Naturally, if you have yet to sample the ample delights of God of War’s 2018 outing you really should. Like, right now. Right this moment – not least because failing to do so will leave you scratching your head in confusion at why certain things are happening in God of War: Ragnarok.Though God of War: Ragnarok opens on the familiar surroundings of Kratos and Atreus’ idyllic logged home in Midgard (complete with a wonderfully intact hole in the ceiling after his titanic scrap with Baldur in the last game), a fair chunk of time has passed and with it both Kratos and Atreus have gotten older, with the latter in particular gaining a degree of maturity, introspection and physical prowess that he lacked in the previous game.Once again, the chemistry between the voice actors that bring Kratos and Atreus to life, Christopher Judge and Sunny Suljic respectively, is front and centre of the breathlessly expansive tale that God of War: Ragnarok tells. Specifically the actual passage of time in real-life has seen Suljic essentially age alongside his on-screen role, with his deepening tone and cadence reinforcing the fact that Atreus has matured a good few years since we last saw him.Instead of just tagging along and being barked at by his dear old dad (though that still does happen on occasion), Atreus now has his own mission that must be completed and after being exposed to the prophecy at the end of the previous game, will stop at nothing to make sure that fate does not come to pass. This is no longer a father and son team where Kratos does all the (excuse the pun) heavy lifting, but rather something approaching an equal deal where Atreus more than holds up his side of the partnership – Atreus no longer piggybacking on his dad’s back when climbing walls is one such example of how the dynamic has changed between the two.Perhaps there is no keener example of Atreus’ importance to God of War: Ragnarok than the fact that there are numerous sections in the game where the player is solely controlling Atreus away from his father. Fear not though, not only is Atreus a joy to use in combat thanks to his hyper-kinetic bow based attacks (think a turbocharged Legolas and you’re basically there) that deftly mix up melee and ranged combat, but the lion’s share of God of War: Ragnarok still has you in control of the titular angry deity.It really cannot be overstated that God of War: Ragnarok is huge, absolutely huge. Clocking in 40-50 hours for a single playthrough without hoovering up all of the side content and additional challenges, God of War: Ragnarok is at least twice the size of 2018’s God of War and does indeed feel like it could have been split out into two games. In a practical sense though, the enormity of God of War: Ragnarok means that the storytelling and characters all get ample time to shine and this stands as one of God of War: Ragnarok’s greatest strengths.A perfect example of this is the character development that everyone’s favourite pair of dysfunctional Dwarven brothers enjoy in God of War: Ragnarok. Though Brok and Sindri once more return as the same effective comic relief that they were in God of War’s 2018 outing, they are given much more to do than just throw the odd sarcastic quip at you and offer to craft your gear.In God of War: Ragnarok, both Brok and Sindri now get stuck into the action as they effectively become your battle partner, able to unleash their own form of violence (which often comes in the guise of massively explodey bombs) on their hapless foes. Beyond their newfound agency, Brok and Sindri have also seen substantial character development too, as their involvement in Ragnarok’s story is emotionally stirring in ways that I entirely did not expect.Where the additional breadth of God of War: Ragnarok is really leveraged however, is in how it has allowed developer Sony Santa Monica to really dive into Norse mythology and introduce a range of entirely new characters to the proceedings. Though the likes of Thor, Tyr and others are present and accounted for, Sony Santa Monica has given some of the perhaps lesser known figures of Norse mythology time to shine as well, resulting in some unexpectedly entertaining, and in some cases hilarious, new characters appearing in God of War: Ragnarok.It’s certainly worth noting that Kratos has seen his own fair share of character development, too. 2018’s God of War did a brilliant thing by finally giving Kratos a voice and an emotional anchor in his son Atreus, finally realising him as a fully-fleshed out protagonist that was a world away from the exclusively shouty and angry engine of murder that he was in the series entries prior to 2018. God of War: Ragnarok continues that trend of humanising Kratos, but it does so incrementally, slowly pulling at the corners of Kratos stoic mask to reveal an essentially insecurely paranoid but ultimately tender father who is scared to death that he won’t be able to do right by his son.Much like the previous game then, the relationship between Kratos and Atreus remains front and centre in God of War: Ragnarok but now their connection is largely defined by the revelation seen in the prophecy at the end of the first game, which now hangs like a sword over the events of God of War: Ragnarok. As such, God of War: Ragnarok has a real shroud of fatalism cast on its proceedings, making you feel increasingly more twitchy and paranoid the closer you are to its end, not least because the characters are so well-written that you can’t help but care for them as they all collectively hurl themselves into the Norse apocalypse to defeat a greater foe.Naturally, that greater foe is none other than the All-Father himself, Odin. A vastly different proposition to the big bads of previous God of War titles, Odin’s slight form and softly spoken, though occasionally flippant nature, belies a deity that is furiously driven by a single purpose at the expense of everything else. Where Odin truly becomes a compelling villain however is in how he slyly manipulates those around him to achieve his objectives. Odin isn’t some barrel-chested, booming voice Greek god that uses force to subjugate those that oppose him, instead he tricks people into acting against their own self-interest all the while fulfilling his. With God of War becoming a deeper and more sophisticated series from a storytelling perspective, it makes total sense that the heroes and villains evolve alongside it and in Odin, God of War: Ragnarok presents one of the most entertaining big bads that I have seen in quite some time.Again, it bears remembering that from a design standpoint God of War: Ragnarok is extremely similar to its predecessor, albeit with some notable changes. For a start, God of War: Ragnarok fulfils the promise of allowing players to journey to each of the Nine Realms and in doing so, the player is treated to a proper variance of game worlds to enjoy. From the almost tropical Dwarven realm of Svartalfheim, through to the twilight deserts of the Elven realm of Alfheim, God of War: Ragnarok certainly isn’t lacking in new and exciting worlds for players to discover and explore.What is especially interesting about God of War: Ragnarok though, is that while you’ll be revisiting many of the same realms from 2018’s God of War, their makeup has been altered irrevocably in many cases. In large part this is because the death of Baldur hasn’t just set Freya on a mission of vengeance to kill Kratos, but it has also triggered Fimbulwinter, the Great Winter which precedes Ragnarok and in the case of Midgard, the whole realm has been snowed all the way in and the Lake of the Nine has completely frozen over, providing all-new opportunities for players to explore and discover new secrets as a result.Like 2018’s God of War before it, God of War: Ragnarok understands that exploring the myriad realms, unearthing treasure and discovering hidden lore is one of its greatest strengths and once again, that very same hook remains not only ever present but also enhanced thanks to the greatly expanded game world. Speaking of the game world, God of War: Ragnarok follows in the footsteps of 2018’s God of War, but makes a few tweaks in this regard. While the Lake of the Nine was pretty much the only hub area in God of War, its sequel expands on that concept with a few of the Nine Realms having their own mini hub areas where you’re not locked in by a linear path and can explore and unearth secrets at your leisure.As before, exploration and the subsequent discovery of treasure, loot and side-quests ties directly into God of War: Ragnarok’s progression system since the more XP and raw materials you unearth, the more skills and abilities you’ll be able to earn and of course, the better gear you’ll be able to craft. Rather than just follow 2018’s God of War to the letter though, God of War: Ragnarok has meaningfully evolved how character progression is handled on a number of levels.Though skill trees return for both Kratos and Atreus, it’s really in the gear that God of War: Ragnarok truly separates itself from its predecessor. As one might expect the Leviathan Axe and fan-favourite Blades of Chaos return, but in God of War: Ragnarok both of them are augmented by a new elemental system which allows players to infuse additional frost and fire damage accordingly depending on the foe that they are facing. More than that, the ability to infuse elemental energy into your weapons also feeds into the new Signature Strike system which when activated, provides Kratos with an overabundance of elemental damage. It’s a seemingly small thing, sure, but it does provide an added layer of sophistication to the combat in God of War: Ragnarok.Away from the weapons, God of War: Ragnarok also makes appreciable strides in defensive combat design too. The once humble shield from 2018’s God of War, now finds itself split off into a number of very different shield types in order to accommodate different playstyles. In God of War: Ragnarok shields now boast different characteristics that can either enhance overall defence stats for gamers that prefer to constantly keep their shield up when they aren’t attacking, or focus in on quick parries for those that like to intercept enemy attacks. Again, it’s just one more system that improves the combat system of God of War: Ragnarok by providing players with additional tools to approach different encounters.Beyond the gear and skill trees, God of War: Ragnarok has also changed up how the rage system works too. Instead of Kratos only having access to a single type of rage that allows him to deal damage and restore health, there are two others that prioritise health regeneration and damage accordingly – once more permitting players to have a broader degree of control over their builds than ever before.Without spoiling the narrative context behind it, God of War: Ragnarok also has a sizable endgame of sorts for skilled players to sink their teeth into with a special enemy that doesn’t reveal themselves until the end credits have rolled. And of course, God of War: Ragnarok still boasts many of the same staples of its predecessor, including the returning Muspelheim trials and a variety of epic and extremely challenging encounters with the new Berserkers, that essentially replace the Valkyries from 2018’s God of War. Make no mistake, God of War: Ragnarok gives you bang for your buck and then some.Happily, I can also report that the brutal spectacle that has arguably defined the God of War franchise since its inception is present and accounted for with aplomb in God of War: Ragnarok. Whether it’s Kratos is scrapping with Thor in a literally thunderous encounter, or the dawn of Ragnarok itself (not to mention a whole truckload of other sequences that I’m not going to spoil because, good lord, you absolutely need to experience them for yourself), it’s clear that God of War: Ragnarok places a premium on the sort of epic action that puts Hollywood to shame. Oh and of course, the whole game from start to end is shot in a single take.Much has been made over the fact that God of War: Ragnarok is a cross-gen title, but quite honestly, God of War: Ragnarok might just be the best cross-gen title I’ve seen on PS5. Though its last-gen design bedrock can be seen in aspects of its design (there are still no shortage of holes in the wall for Kratos and co to shuffle through), the level of detail, quality of lighting and scene composition is right up there with the most visually accomplished PS5 titles around.Not only are the environments awash with a stunning level of detail and colour, but so too have the character models seen ample improvement too. Atreus for example, no longer has the uncanny death stare that he spent most of the previous game cursed with and instead his cheeks and forehead crease appropriately when he is expressing himself, while big man Kratos has had yet more wrinkles and muscular detail added to his hulking physique.Clearly though, it’s the facial animations in God of War: Ragnarok that have seen the biggest improvement. Approaching the level of fidelity seen in The Last of Us Part 2, God of War: Ragnarok’s character models have never been more emotive, which is fitting really when you consider the added emotional heft that God of War: Ragnarok’s narrative brings over its predecessor.Sitting atop these improvements are a number of different visual presets that will be familiar to any PS5 owner that has played PlayStation Studios previous output. When running in fidelity mode, God of War: Ragnarok outputs at native 4K resolution and 30 frames per second, while performance mode does exactly what you think it does by lowering the resolution and attempting to hit 60 frames per second cap (which it does pretty much all of the time). Additionally, lucky owners of HDMI 2.1 compliant displays get to enjoy a 40 frames per second target in fidelity mode, while a high frame rate mode has the frames per second exceeding 60 at the cost of display resolution.What’s most surprising about the different visual presets that God of War: Ragnarok boasts is how similar the visuals all appear when they are in use. Whether you’re using fidelity or performance mode, you’re still getting a super crisp, highly detailed visual presentation that is absolutely, 100% up there with some of the best looking games on PS5.Away from the visual side of things, Sony’s current-gen console also brings other palpable technical benefits to God of War: Ragnarok. Loading times are now, thankfully, much swifter than they ever were before, while DualSense haptic feedback is beautifully employed, as every oar stroke comes through the pad and the adaptive triggers lend the appropriate heft and resistance to every axe swing.God of War: Ragnarok is the perfect sequel. A carefully iterative offering that beautifully maintains the essence of 2018’s Game of the Year while making meaningful improvements to augment its already stellar combat and progression systems, God of War: Ragnarok is a meaty and deeply emotional epic that effortlessly secures its place as one of the best games on PS5 and a sure-fire Game of the Year candidate.God of War: Ragnarok releases for PS4 and PS5 on November 9, 2022.Review code kindly provided by PR.More God of War Ragnarok Guides:God of War: Ragnarok is the perfect sequel.
