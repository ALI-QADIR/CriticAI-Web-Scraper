The Last of Us Part II,Oli Welsh,Eurogamer,https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-06-12-the-last-of-us-part-2-review-a-gut-wrenching-sequel,"Emerald city blues.The most common joke about the difficulty video games have reconciling their storytelling impulses with the violent action so many of them depend on revolves around the character Nathan Drake. Star of the Uncharted series, Drake is famed for his easygoing, flippant charm - yet over the course of a single game he will typically kill hundreds of people. They call him the smiling psychopath.The joke must have stung the Californian Sony studio Naughty Dog, Uncharted's maker. In 2013 they started to grapple with its implications in The Last of Us, a moody post-apocalyptic thriller that upped the graphic brutality while seeking to frame it in the context of a desperate, cruel world, and also contrast it with the delicate bond developing between the protagonist, gruff smuggler Joel, and his cargo, a teen called Ellie.Now The Last of Us has a sequel, and in that sequel the wrestling match between the game's violent action and its thematic intentions has developed into a full-on, bareknuckle brawl. It is, perhaps for the first time in the history of big-budget action games, a fair match. It gets messy and problematic, and neither side comes out unscathed. But, by taking some big gambles, the developers land decisive blows that will send you reeling.This isn't even all that The Last of Us Part 2 is attempting. This is a game about women - not about the female experience per se, but a game in which almost all the notable characters are women and in which they are not only shown exhibiting great capability and physical prowess, but also contending with dark impulses typically ascribed to men: trauma, obsession, rage and revenge. It is also a game featuring LGBTQ+ relationships and characters in a prominent but matter-of-fact way - it's not a big deal, they are just there.And it is doing all this, remember, while remaining very much a crowd-pleasing action spectacular in the Naughty Dog mould, with thrills and spills and scares, beauty and ruin and high adventure. It is a lot. Too much, really, and it is no surprise that this game gets away from its creators at times. (Yes, even the famously controlling Naughty Dog.) Not all of it works. Sometimes the tone veers into a depressing, distasteful nihilism. The characters' motivations don't always stack up. The cast is overstuffed and the subplots are often over- or undercooked. Some of its points are made with an almost laughable bluntness as it hurries on to its next big idea. At other times, it operates with rare subtlety and understatement. You will be halfway through the game before you understand what it's actually doing and more than that before you really begin to feel its dread pull. Towards the very end, it is devastating.It's a very hard game to discuss without spoilers. I won't share any specifics, but if you want to go in completely cold, it might be wise to stop reading.The action is set four years after the events of The Last of Us, with intermittent flashbacks that fill us in on how the characters got from there to here. Joel and Ellie have settled in the self-sufficient community of Jackson, Wyoming. The awkwardness between them after Joel's fateful actions at the end of the previous game seems to have widened into a rift. Ellie, less precocious and more defensive and spiky as a young adult, is on the verge of a relationship with a woman called Dina. In the aftermath of a snowstorm, something happens that sees Ellie and Dina set off for Seattle with revenge on their minds.Seattle, where we spend the majority of the game's runtime, is in bad shape. It's in total ruins, partly flooded, and initially seems deserted but for pockets of infected, the grotesque fungal zombies that have brought society down. In fact, there's a turf war raging here between two factions of survivors. The Washington Liberation Front, or Wolves, are a paramilitary organisation - a more warlike version of the first game's Fireflies - that assumed control of the city from the government after a brutal uprising. They have a darkly charismatic leader called Isaac (a cameo by the magnetic actor Jeffrey Wright), and once we learn more about them, they paint a strikingly different picture of post-outbreak survivalism than the frontiersman stylings of the Jacksonites. The Seraphites, or Scars, are less well drawn, a cut-and-paste post-apocalytpic spooky cult that is never given a plausible reason for existing.On the warpath, Ellie inserts herself into this struggle and starts causing all sorts of havoc - but only after a lovely lull. When she and Dina first arrive in Seattle, the game's remorseless linear momentum is briefly broken for a pocket of open-world exploration of the ruined downtown district (an evolution of a similar episode in Uncharted: The Lost Legacy). It's a wonderfully atmospheric scene-setter. After this, we're back on Naughty Dog's beaten path for the rest of the game, although the environments are roomy and complex enough to allow for satisfying close exploration as you scavenge for supplies, as well as affording a great deal of flexibility when it comes to combat encounters.It's during combat that you're most aware that you're playing a sequel from one of the world's most fastidious developers (albeit one that has seldom been known for the refinement of its gameplay mechanics). The careful iteration and professionalism of the design team are very evident. It retains The Last of Us' lean, muscular set-up, in which scarcity of ammo and supplies constantly forces you to experiment. Some of the rougher edges have been knocked off, but not so many as to eradicate its essentially scrappy nature - panicky, desperate scrapes and unintended messy bloodbaths are very much part of the vibe.So is stealth, which thanks to some mechanical lifts from Uncharted 4 and the addition of a prone stance is much more viable and satisfying to play; this is now a pretty well-sorted stealth game in its own right. Like any game in which death comes quickly, it can still frustrate, but a very clever smart autosave system keeps good pace with your progress and means you'll seldom need to restart a whole encounter. (The whole game experience is unbelievably slick and seamless, even by Naughty Dog's standards.) My chief complaint is that you spend more time battling humans than infected, and they're actually the less interesting - as well as less scary - combatants to face.The violence is extremely graphic, uncomfortably so. It's full of ugly flourishes, like the splattering sound of shotgun pellets ripping apart flesh, or the vicious flick that Ellie uses to slice open a neck as she performs a stealth kill. It can be sickening. Intentionally so? Surely. But I still can't help but detect a sour, grubby note of gratification to it, particularly in the repetitive context of the combat. Sometimes it breaks your connection to Ellie in a way that doesn't serve the game. Sometimes, in cutscenes, it's just taken too far, more than is needed to leave an impact or make a point.This is one reason why I initially suspected The Last of Us Part 2 of being too caught up in its own grim attitude, of just being highly polished misery porn. Another is that, with its attention divided between so many ambitious gambits, with an expanding cast of characters and with most of the action taking place over a matter of days, it doesn't have the first game's gentle but constant emotional core - that delicious slow thawing between Ellie and Joel, melting into love as you journey with them over the course of a year. (Ellie and Dina's romance might have been that, but it doesn't get the necessary screen time - admittedly for good reasons.) Without that warmth, that heart, it seems a bitter world to spend time in.I'm happy to report that my first impressions were wrong. Unfortunately, I can't and shouldn't fully explain why. I'll limit myself to this: Druckmann and his team have a grand plan that rests on a radical structure for the game which isn't initially apparent. Once you finally understand it, it's still a slow burn, as the writers' delicate character-building - the dialogue is wonderfully understated and naturalistic - needs time to do its work. So it isn't until the game's final stretches that it gathers its true power, as you approach a point that is all the more horrifying for its total inevitability.It's a huge roll of the dice from the developers, but it works, and the pay-off is almost indescribable. It would be too much to claim that you will never feel the same about video game violence again, but the shock is profound and discomfiting. It's gut-wrenching stuff. There's more to come as the game approaches an ending that is just as affecting and emotionally complex as its predecessor's, if not, perhaps, as ambiguous.The thing that really struck me - and pleasantly surprised me, coming as it does from a developer so transparently in love with the language of cinema - is that The Last of Us Part 2's power is wholly unique to it being a video game. There is a special kind of empathy that develops between a player and a game protagonist that no other medium can reproduce. It's this bond that Druckmann and his team have exploited to such devastating effect. It is a sad and timely reminder of the simultaneous importance and impossibility of living someone else's experience.

Platform(s): PS4
Developer: Naughty Dog
Publisher: Sony Interactive The Last of Us 2 (opens in new tab) has consumed me. It's the last thing I've been thinking about as I've gone to bed, and the first thing that enters my head when I wake up. I've relived entire sequences in my mind, marvelling at their exquisite design, and wondering what I could have done differently. Its many, many unforgettable cutscenes are burned into my brain as though they were real memories, so evocative in their fierce, emotional resonance that they now hold a regular presence in most of my dreams, not to mention my nightmares.I've spent hours just trying to process everything I've played, coming to terms with its densely packed story, and discovering new avenues of appreciation for its craft. What I'm trying to say is that The Last of Us Part 2 is exceptional, and quite possibly the best game I've played this generation. As a heads up, this review is completely spoiler free, so I won't be discussing any plot details outside of what Naughty Dog has already shown so far.If 2013's The Last of Us (opens in new tab) was a road trip turned twisted coming of age story, The Last of Us Part 2 is its revenge western companion piece. Set five years after the events of her pan-American odyssey with Joel, an indescribably traumatic opening episode leaves Ellie hellbent on a crusade to hunt down those responsible for a seemingly unforgivable crime. This pursuit takes our teenage heroine away from the rural pastures of Jackson County and deep into the urban overgrowth of Seattle, a city that experienced a very different kind of societal breakdown to The Last of Us' Boston, and thus poses its own unique threats to Ellie's survival. I won't divulge any more details beyond that, but suffice to say that what starts out as a fairly straightforward tale of retribution morphs into something far more complex, surprising, and sinister. As with the original game, Naughty Dog cunningly exploits the interactivity of its medium with masterful assuredness, forcing players to take a cold, hard look at every action they make as Ellie, with all the discomfort and distress that entails. The resulting 25 hour campaign is as full of controller-dropping 'holy crap' moments as it is the quiet, contemplative scenes of immense poignancy that the studio is known for, many of which are enough to leave a lump in the throat, if not render you a bawling wreck on the couch. As a contemplation of the thin line between justice and vengeance, and an uncomfortable plunge into the darker shades of the human psyche, The Last of Us Part 2 is unforgiving in its depiction of violence, nihilism, and the nebulousness of morality in a world without laws. At the heart of it all, however, is Ellie, once again textured with incredible warmth and humanity by Ashley Johnson, in the kind of performance that we'll still be talking about years from now. The complexity of suffering is no easy thing to depict on screen, but Johnson's ownership of Ellie's character throughout it all is nothing short of awards worthy, aided seamlessly by Naughty Dog's cutting edge facial animation technology, which lets even the slightest change in body language speak a thousand words. Ellie is surrounded by an equally compelling cast of characters, too, with new additions like Shannon Woodward's Dina, Stephen Chang's Jesse, and many others quickly proving themselves to be as well-rounded and multi-dimensional as the game's returning cast of familiar faces. Speaking of, Troy Baker steals some of Part 2's best scenes as Joel, showing us new sides to the character that enriches and complicates the relationship we developed with him over the course of the first game. If you thought The Last of Us' giraffe scene was a tear jerker, boy does this sequel have some treasures for you. The Last of Us Part 2's story is one of great scale and intricate nuance, then, and the same can be said for its world. Naughty Dog has stretched the parameters of its linear game design to create environments that always feel like part of something larger than you are, yet are still crammed to the gills with the kind of handmade detail typically only reserved for more compactly structured single-player experiences. The Last of Us Part 2 has more accessibility options than any other Naughty Dog game (opens in new tab)You can spend hours poring over the digital seams of every building, forest, and cavern, not just out of a desire to scavenge as much craftable scrap material as Ellie can carry, but to soak up the atmosphere and enjoy the bespoke minutiae of Naughty Dog's handiwork. Every place has a story, offering a window into both the world that Ellie never knew, and the one she's all too familiar with, all told authentically through deftly placed artefacts, heuristic clues, and cleverly devised organic moments that bring each space to life. Naughty Dog's environmental design still gently guides you along the critical path even with all that added emphasis on exploration, though, and never in a way that feels forced, or draws you out of the illusion. The sense of pace and flow that underscores each level as a result is impeccable, each mission resembling a playable tapestry that builds and crescendos at a tempo that always feels unpredictable and compelling. It helps that Ellie is now able to navigate terrain far more competently than Joel ever could, smashing windows, abseiling off walls, and jumping from precarious heights to enter previously unreachable areas, allowing Naughty Dog to challenge players with more diverse environmental puzzles that enrich combat and exploration. These new gameplay mechanics are hardly novel ideas to the video game discipline, but they're deployed in The Last of Us Part 2 with the same level of care and dexterity as every other, all working in tandem to conjure a distinct sense of place anchored in that patented Naughty Dog approach to authenticity. It should go without saying, of course, that The Last of Us Part 2 is the PlayStation studio's best looking title yet, and quite possibly the most visually impressive game we've seen on the PS4 to date. When sunlight flickers through the fern flanked forests rustling gently against the breeze, or the Seattle skyline burns red in the ambient hues of dusk, it's a thing of abject beauty, and you'll have no choice but to make use of Last of Us Part 2's helpful in-game photo mode.The Last of Us' guerilla style combat, too, has similarly been sophisticated to heighten the breakneck, jittery tension that permeates every skirmish. That's largely thanks to some of the most advanced enemy AI you'll ever have the (mis)fortune of brushing up against, who - like everything else in The Last of Us Part 2 - look and act disturbingly lifelike. Adversaries call each other out by name, adopt revised strategies in reaction to your behaviour, and deploy new tools such as hunting dogs to sniff Ellie out from cover. Thankfully, Ellie can more easily float between stealth and open combat than Joel, able to use decade's worth of post-apocalyptic overgrowth as natural cover, or manoeuvre between small gaps to evade enemies and get the drop on others. When you are caught out, and you almost certainly will be, fights descend into a messy trade of gunfire, explosives, and physical blows. It's here where things get extra stressful, particularly when the combat enters close quarters, and The Last of Us' nauseating depiction of raw violence refuses to let you inure to the full weight of your actions, the agonising screams and jugular death rattles of your victims haunting your memory long after you've killed them. The next evolution of The Last of Us' infected, meanwhile, are more terrifying than ever before. The now iconic throat percussion of Clickers may still be enough to send a shiver down your spine whenever they fall within earshot, but just wait till you hear the guttural moans of Part 2's walking toxin bombs, the Shamblers, or find yourself backed into a dark room with… well, I'll let you discover the rest for yourself. Naughty Dog leans unexpectedly hard into the horror side of its survival horror subject matter, amplifying the fear factor in ways that surprise, impress, and spook in equal measure, likely to leave even the most habituated gore hounds with their hands shaking. Thankfully, Ellie has plenty of choices at her disposal to stay two steps ahead of her aggressors. New craftable tools, from explosive arrows to trip mines, embellish the improvised warfare with more opportunities for collateral damage, while the addition of skill trees - unlocked via Supplements and Hobbyist Magazines found across Seattle - offer players yet more agency in making those tough calls about where to best spend resources. ""Not only justifies its existence as a sequel most didn't think was necessary, but stands confidently apart as an entirely different beast.""Weapon workbenches are also back, rendered in insanely fastidious detail, and Part 2 expands The Last of Us' returning arsenal of firearms with a number of surprising new additions that I won't spoil here. That said, all boast the mechanical rigour you'd expect from Naughty Dog's tactile gunplay, always feeling impactful when a shot lands but never reliable enough to get you from point A to B through sheer force alone.  All of these systems and mechanics operate together seamlessly in The Last of Us Part 2 like gears in a clock bound by a distinct, singular vision, conjuring up an experience that never feels anything less than an exemplary feat of impeccable game design.  If there's perhaps one area where The Last of Us Part 2 can be faulted, it's for occasionally getting lost amidst the reeds of its own ambition. Like that of Uncharted 4 (opens in new tab), the scale of Naughty Dog's plot can fall into the habit of overwriting itself, losing its momentum out of a need to tie up every story thread or emphasise a thematic point that had already been made hours ago. That deviation from its narrative focal point is rare at best, and doesn't undercut the impact of what is otherwise an incredibly powerful cautionary fable, but the game's layered, prestige television-style structure is excessive to the point of exhaustive at times. Relatedly, if the ending of The Last of Us was controversial for all the right reasons, Part 2's doesn't quite land with as much subversive tact, though does nothing to undo the resonance of the journey leading up to its final scene. But no masterpiece is perfect, and The Last of Us Part 2 is absolutely a masterpiece, have no doubt. There is so much more about this game that I'm desperate to sing its praises for, but simply can't without spoiling anything beyond what's already been shown. Daring, uncompromising, and unlike anything I've played in a long, long time, Naughty Dog has created its most progressive interactive adventure yet. The Last of Us Part 2 not only justifies its existence as a sequel most didn't think was necessary, supplementing and elevating the timeless qualities of its predecessor, but stands confidently apart as an entirely different beast, one bearing its own fangs that bite with just as much force. The lasting achievement is nothing short of extraordinary, and a game we'll be looking back on for decades to come. I'm GamesRadar's Features Writer, which makes me responsible for gracing the internet with as many of my words as possible, including reviews, previews, interviews, and more.

The Last of Us Part II,Andy McNamara,Game Informer,https://www.gameinformer.com/review/the-last-of-us-part-ii/the-last-of-us-part-ii-review-a-perfect-circle,"There are many things about human nature we struggle against. We see what we want to see. We acquire our beliefs and perspectives from the people and the world around us. And sometimes, in order to see, we must be shown.The Last of Us Part II illuminates many complicated and difficult facets of humanity – a journey that tackles empathy, anger, and how we are defined by those around us. These philosophical considerations can be uncomfortable to wrestle with, but Naughty Dog conveys them with careful nuance and unflinching emotion, creating a narrative masterpiece with a unique power few games have ever achieved.The story opens with a conversation about how the first game ended – about what Joel did at the Firefly hospital, and the lie he told Ellie about it. That exchange lays the foundation for the current state of their complicated relationship, which players come to understand even more deeply as the story continues. Holed up in an encampment in Jackson, Wyoming, Ellie and Joel are trying to come to terms with the consequences of their previous actions, and the world continues to suffer from the chaos of the infection that has transformed mankind and ravaged civilization.The Last of Us Part II is defined by its story at every turn, and Naughty Dog masterfully weaves its themes in at every level. It depicts the raw violence that Ellie uses to navigate this harsh world, and that violence feeds into pivotal plot points during her quest for revenge. Yes, you kill many humans and Infected along the way, but the accumulated effect of Ellie’s fury weighs on you over time. Even as you clear an area of hostile guards, you question your own role in the brutality. The people you assassinate have names, and you can overhear them talking about their loved ones as you sneak up on them. Though it’s difficult to say that this is “fun,” the way The Last of Us Part II forges this level of investment and immersion is one of its greatest strengths.The chaotic, post-apocalyptic overlay creates the perfect opportunity for different factions to vie for power. In addition to the zombie-like Infected, you also fight the militarized WLF and the technology-averse Seraphites. You deal with all these groups in intense encounters that blend sneaking and shooting in varied and unpredictable ways. Ellie’s increased agility lets you jump, crawl, and vault through areas and take advantage of verticality, but the biggest improvement to combat is the way the world pushes you to play. Stealth is always rewarded, and you can control the battlefield with clever use of your resources, especially in the larger environments. I knew I made a mistake when I died, and I felt satisfaction when I skillfully handled a situation.Even with its many combat scenarios, The Last of Us Part II offers tranquil and lonely moments. Some areas are devoid of encounters completely, but they don’t feel barren. Instead, they focus on world-building, or cause you as a player to reflect on your actions. The people you meet along the way also play an important part in your journey; when traveling alone, you feel their absence.Environments tell their own stories of those who became infected. People waiting for their families to return, soldiers hunting deserters, and patients seeking treatment – you piece together these tragic and fascinating tales by reading notes and interpreting clues in the world. From a more practical standpoint, exploring every area is important for gathering resources used to craft items and upgrade talents like faster crawling and improved awareness. Almost every corner has something to find, and I felt rewarded for digging through drawers and searching every room. Going into an empty store, it was easy to feel for the characters in this world who had their lives upended. And as much as gaming can be an escape, the state of the real world right now provides a lens that is difficult to ignore; I never thought seeing the remains of a bookstore or a restaurant would hit harder due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but they did.The production values that Naughty Dog brings to this experience are second to none. The characters don’t only look good – they look real, complete with quirks that make them more believable as humans. The world and its inhabitants are visually stunning, with artwork and animations you will see just once, quips and conversations that make the world feel alive, and a soundtrack and sound effects that brought chills to my spine. Low hums and water dripping on empty bottles add to the tension as you navigate the perils of the world.I can rave about the attention to detail, the world, and the combat, but the story is where The Last of Us Part II sets a new bar. It is more about challenging your heart than your reflexes, and I simply cannot recommend it enough. There is much to be said about this game that can’t be said here due to spoilers, but you should play it as soon as you can with as little info as possible. But you don’t need to know specifics to appreciate how the gameplay and environmental cues all play into a single purpose: They make you feel the choices, helplessness, and the violence at the heart of this world and its characters. I can safely say this is the best narrative game I have played. I felt the loss. I felt the confusion. It is a game that turned me inside out with each twist of the screw.© 1991 to  Game Informer.

   on June 25, 2020 at 11:46AM PDTEditor's note: Due to embargo restrictions around spoilers, parts of this review are intentionally vague. We've done our best to explain certain parts of the game and our critique without discussing any story spoilers; however, if you want to understand the full context of our analysis here, you can read the spoilery version of this review, which discusses the story in greater detail and further explains our thoughts. That review has the same score and just serves as a deeper, more detailed analysis for those who want to read more.At the beginning of The Last of Us Part II, you get a glimpse of Ellie's life in idyllic Jackson, Wyoming. If it weren't for the walls surrounding the town, you could almost forget that the world is crawling with infectious monsters that would kill everyone in sight; its main road, blanketed in snow, is a charming row of old buildings with decks for sidewalks, more Old West town than post-apocalypse settlement. Its residents grow food, care for horses, tend bars, and even have dances and movie nights. Four years after Joel saved (kidnapped?) Ellie from the Firefly hospital, this is the life he wanted for her.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: The Last Of Us Part II Video ReviewThe Last of Us Part II grapples with Joel's decision not through Joel, but through Ellie. This life is clearly not enough for her; she's distant and brooding, obviously conflicted about something. She's changed a lot. And when everything falls apart and she sets out in search of vengeance, you see her pain in its rawest, most brutal form. It's a devastating, gruesome story of revenge in which the purpose of violence gets muddied by its intensity. But as a character study, The Last of Us Part II is beautiful and haunting, and I found myself completely overwhelmed by the emotional weight of it.In some ways, I mean that literally. The game gave me stress nightmares, not because you kill a lot of people per se, but because playing as Ellie felt more like being dragged by my hair than being immersed in her mission. From the very beginning, I wanted to reach out and shake Ellie, as her proxy in all this, and get her to do anything other than what we were about to do. I knew her revenge quest was bad news before the killing and maiming really began.There are narrative reasons for that, though, and they do work. Being helpless as a player in the face of Ellie's destruction serves a grander purpose that I won't spoil here. The biggest issue is that the most impactful of her kills occur in cutscenes rather than in combat, and that obscures the purpose of combat's more upsetting aspects.The Last of Us Part II's combat is tense and exhilarating, though confronting in its brutality. Ellie is scrappy and agile, and moving through a combat arena is an art. Her movements are smooth enough that they almost look scripted; you can duck and dodge in a fight and deliver a return blow with a series of button presses that translate into a strangely graceful dance. You can accidentally alert an enemy to your presence only to slip through a tight space in the wall, vault through a window, and outrun your pursuer through a building to reestablish your cover and gain the upper hand. You can also easily get surrounded and die horribly, whether you're fighting people or infected.Navigating any given combat scenario is a puzzle in which you have to figure out exactly how to get from point A to point B with the resources you have. I'm partial to stealth when possible, and it's especially rewarding to decide how you're going to silently kill each enemy with only a flimsy silencer, two arrows, and your default knife. Should you kill the blind clickers first because they're strong and deadly, or should you kill the infected runners first because they can see you? Can you retrieve an arrow from a corpse to be reused on their friend? Most importantly, where's the exit?You can also find yourself going up against both humans and infected at the same time, and this is when combat is properly fun instead of just tense. By throwing a bottle, you can draw a clicker toward an enemy soldier and simply wait for them to kill each other. You can shoot glass above an enemy's head to send a runner or two straight to their location. You can simply take advantage of the chaos and start shooting indiscriminately. Regardless, it makes you feel clever and giddy and weirdly proud of yourself.Of course, that's if you numb yourself to the guttural screams of the man whose arm you just shot off or the awful gurgling sound of someone drowning in their own blood. Enemies use each other's names and aren't shy about crying out when they find their friend David or Rachel or whoever lying face-down in a pool of blood, suddenly dead from your silent knife takedown. Killing someone's dog is a priority, as they can track your scent and maul you to death, but you have to hear them mourn the dog in real-time. It helps--or maybe doesn't help--that the game runs flawlessly, even on a standard PS4, so there are no hiccups to dampen the viciousness.Ellie's movements are smooth enough that they almost look scripted; you can duck and dodge in a fight and deliver a return blow with a series of button presses that translate into a strangely graceful dance.All of that surely exists to make you feel bad about killing people and their dogs. But like I said above, the kills that actually matter in the broader scope of the story happen in cutscenes. Some are triggered by a button prompt or preceded by a brawl, but it's all very controlled; it's not like you're killing these important people in a regular combat scenario, realizing with horror later what you've done. These are the kills that end up hurting the most, and they're going to happen no matter what you do or what you think of all the violence. That's why they work so well for the story, but that also leaves the rest of the bloodshed rather unexamined.Frankly, the fact that your enemies have names doesn't make them any less in your way. You have to do what you have to do to get to the next location, and you want to do that to see where the story goes next.This disconnect between the video game-y aspects and the grander narrative is compounded by looting and collectible-hunting. Looting during a fight is exciting, especially when you find the one extra bullet you need or a bit of health that can keep you going. But more often than not, I'd loot and look for collectibles only after I'd killed every enemy in the vicinity. It's far easier and safer, for one, and I didn't want to miss any of the interesting sub-plots found in scattered notes and photographs just because I wanted to kill fewer people.Finding collectibles and piecing together the stories held within them is rewarding and paints a picture of the outbreak as it developed through the years. A bank robbery gone wrong sticks out as a favorite, and there are quite a few other stories worth finding. A lot of the time, seeking out these collectibles will force you to get creative--things like breaking windows to bypass a locked door or swinging on a cable to get to an area that's just out of reach. There's nothing so difficult that you feel like a genius for figuring it out, but it does make you feel appropriately resourceful.Most of the time, there aren't any collectibles to find in combat-heavy areas. But there are still notes and things to find when enemies are around, and as a result, I ended up scouring every corner of every area in the hopes of finding something cool. Because most combat arenas give you multiple avenues of attack and escape, though, I ended up backtracking through most of them to try to find things, and that can severely disrupt the pacing. The nooks and crannies that work well in combat just become one more place to look for a note or trading card, and the fact that you're looking for trading cards at all often feels too game-y for the otherwise sobering tone.I ended up enabling an accessibility option called high-contrast mode to help with my collectible hunt. When toggled on, it mutes the background, removes textures, and highlights interactable objects and enemies. I used it after clearing an area of enemies to speed up the looting part, and while it wasn't the most elegant solution, it did help the pacing. It's one of a litany of accessibility options, too, which allow you to fine-tune the gameplay, sound, and visuals to your needs. It's a commendable suite that's incredibly inclusive.In the second half of the game, these exploration issues persist, as do the horrors of combat and violence. But for reasons I can't explain due to spoiler restrictions, the narrative shifts significantly at a certain point, and the context of everything you've done up until then changes along with it. There's a lot I want to say that I'm not allowed to until the game is out, but this half of the game is the reason anything in it works at all. It examines a lot of the violence that happens early on, though not all the violence in general, and it's where the story finds its meaning.There's a lot I want to say that I'm not allowed to until the game is out, but the second half of the game is the reason anything in it works at all.By the time I finished The Last of Us Part II, I wasn't sure if I liked it. It's a hard game to stomach, in part because so much of who Ellie is and what she does is beyond your control. She is deeply complicated and flawed, and her selfishness hurts a lot of people. At times, the pain you inflict feels so senseless that it can leave you numb. It's all messy and bleak and made me profoundly sad for myriad reasons, but the more I reflect on it, the more I appreciate the story and characters at its core. I wanted almost none of it to happen the way it did, and that's what's both beautiful and devastating about it.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"
The Last of Us Part II,Maddy Myers,Polygon,https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/6/12/21288535/the-last-of-us-part-2-review-ps4-naughty-dog-ellie-joel-violence,"Filed under:Did you know murder is wrong? The Last of Us Part 2 depicts the future, yet it fails to escape its own past.The sequel feels like a time capsule from 2013, the year the first game was released in real life and the year of the fictional in-game zombie outbreak. The Last of Us Part 2 seems doomed to walk in a well-worn circle, unable to break out of the ever-thickening carapace forming along its skin, just like the victims of the Cordyceps fungus that you fight throughout the game. That is the game’s central problem, and what makes so much of it such a challenge to get through: This is a story about characters who seem unable to learn or grow, and more specifically, unable to consider the humanity of the people they kill. If you already think violence isn’t the answer to many of the world’s problems, the repeated lesson that killing is bad makes the game almost maddening. I don’t have any problem empathizing with the people who I’m asked to kill in video games. The Last of Us Part 2 must think I’ll struggle with it, though, since it doles out all sorts of reasons why I should feel regret about the murder spree its characters have embarked upon. But the game’s larger problem is that the characters themselves don’t ever seem able to catch up with me. What’s worse is that the characterization of Ellie makes it seem like she should also understand this part of the journey. I kept expecting her to grow and turn away from a life of constant violence, but she never picks up on the obvious didactic nature of the game she’s in, even as the designers beat you over the head with a very simple lesson about the value of human life.  Part 2 is a game about not rising above revenge or violent urges in general. It’s filled with characters dedicated to never seeing the bigger picture beyond themselves. Although the game’s backdrop is a global pandemic, and although it reaches toward the idea of larger injustices by depicting two warring human factions — the cult of the Seraphites, and the militaristic Washington Liberation Front — it is really just a story about a teen girl, her damage, and her apparent belief that the only way to get over that trauma is murder. A lot of murder. Part 2 opens as Joel, the gruff protagonist from The Last of Us, tells his brother his darkest secret, the secret that may have doomed humanity. After transporting a teenager named Ellie across the country, and learning along the way that she’s likely the only person immune to the fungus, Joel is told that doctors will use her brain tissue to create a vaccine that will keep all living humans safe, but that the process will kill her. It’s a fascinating moral conundrum: What is the value of one young girl measured against the whole of humanity?And so Joel murders everyone in the hospital, and saves the unconscious and unaware Ellie, with whom he’s formed an unshakable, paternal bond — a bond that leads him to doom the rest of the planet by saving her life. When Ellie wakes up and asks what happened, Joel lies. The doctor just ran some pointless tests, he tells her. But, he says, there are plenty of other immune people at the hospital (there aren’t), so maybe a vaccine could still happen someday (nope, not now). Ellie doesn’t seem to believe him, but the credits roll regardless. Joel and the player are left with the unsettling knowledge that a lot of innocent people just died, and that more will fall victim to the fungus and the zombies it creates, all so that one very well-loved teen girl can live. Ellie didn’t have a choice in that decision, and neither did the player. You have to go along with Joel on that one in order to get to the end of the game. It’s a decision that robs the player and Ellie of agency, and the in-game world of a cure, and you better believe it has consequences that didn’t end with the credits on the first game.Part 2 puts us into Ellie’s shoes. Finally, she has the chance to make decisions for herself, and will perhaps even learn the truth about what happened at that hospital. That would present another interesting, challenging question for anyone: How do you live knowing that your life was bought by dooming the world? How do you have a healthy, mutually supportive relationship with the man who murdered innocent people just to save you? And is there a way to do so that doesn’t involve going on your very own murder spree? That direction would force the creative team at Naughty Dog to rethink its own parameters, to go beyond the 2013 conceit of The Last of Us, which invited players to question Joel’s motives but nonetheless forced them to enact those murders along with him if they hoped to see the end of the game. It’s an outdated way to criticize the violence of games, and the complicity of those who play them. Remember 2013? That was the year after Hotline Miami came out, a game with themes that would also appear in its contemporaries — Spec Ops: The Line, BioShock Infinite, and The Last of Us. The Last of Us Part 2 even includes a Hotline Miami reference, so the writers were clearly aware of what they were doing here.  Those were all games that pushed you to feel bad about all the violence that your grizzled white-dude protagonist visited upon others, often for ill-defined reasons, even though the games themselves gave you no choice. Few games had questioned their own body count until that point, but suddenly, in the early 2010s, they were all reacting to the state of in-game stories in the same way: by forcing the player to do things, and then blaming them for doing that thing, even though the player had no other way to proceed.The Last of Us Part 2 gives us a grizzled-beyond-her-years white teen lesbian in the lead role, which is a refreshing change, but the conceit remains the same. Ellie can finally make her own decisions, but just like her dear old surrogate dad, she has a propensity for thinking in the short term and prioritizing her own more animalistic needs for revenge and relief from pain, no matter the human cost. And she’ll be dragging the player along with her, because you have no damn choice but to get homicidal, no matter how much the game wags its finger in your face saying how bad you’re being.  The game’s new heroine may give the impression of some larger progressive message, but it’s just a way to change the instruments, if you will. The song itself remains the same. The Last of Us Part 2 is the latest game that exists at the cross section of shaky moral ideas and an incredibly high level of craft. The sequel takes place in a post-apocalyptic version of Seattle in the year 2038, long after the city’s famous landmarks have crumbled into disrepair, their exteriors overgrown with lush greenery, their interiors crawling with monsters that hunger for human flesh. Meanwhile, various factions of survivors have cropped up, each of them scrapping and murdering one another for territory and resources. It’s all presented to the player with incredible detail and lifelike animation, creating a visually believable vision of a very dire future in which nature is in control and humans are barely hanging on. Ellie traipses through sun-dappled forests, rides her horse over glittering streams, and explores moss-covered storefronts and sprawling suburban homes. She finds handwritten notes from humans desperate to scrawl something out before they succumb to their own infection, or get overrun by some warring human faction or the violent, infected monsters. She scribbles notes of her own in a journal as well, including lyrics for original songs she may someday set to music with the guitar she gets early in the game — a gift from Joel. The Last of Us Part 2 luxuriates in depicting the best parts of being alive in a way that’s somewhat rare, even in games with this kind of budget and scope. The game depicts characters falling in love, discovering a well-hidden post-apocalyptic weed stash, and trying to come up with the worst possible puns. Ellie and her best friend (and crush) Dina live in the walled-off area of Jackson County, Wyoming, with a community of human survivors, along with Joel, his brother Tommy, and Dina’s ex-boyfriend Jesse. They have something close to an actual, relatively safe home during a time when such a thing seems almost impossible, and one night they share a very public kiss during a barn dance attended by most of the community.  Things don’t go well for them after that. That’s because The Last of Us Part 2 also luxuriates in its depictions of pain, suffering, and death. An older man at the barn dance interrupts the girls’ tender moment to spit at Dina, telling her that she’s a “loud-mouthed dyke,” just like Ellie. Now, if Ellie lost her cool and attacked this guy, I’d get it. She doesn’t, however, so I’m not sure what the moment actually accomplishes, other than to remind us that people are still homophobic after the apocalypse. Instead, outsiders to Ellie’s “family” are presented as the true danger, and her rampage against them is blood-curdling in its gruesomeness. The previews for the game have already shown some of the graphic violence in store; the one in which the Seraphites try to lynch one of the characters is a good example of the level on which Part 2 operates. It’s going to show you the bad stuff, and it’s going to rub your face in it.Some of Ellie’s enemies have trained attack dogs, and it’s hard to avoid killing them. Even if you do manage to avoid it, though, there’s eventually a cutscene with a quick-time event that forces you to kill a dog, to hear the animal’s sharp, confused yelp as you smash her skull in with a metal pipe. That wouldn’t be enough suffering, however. Naughty Dog has to make sure you feel horrible, so you’re later treated to a flashback in which you play fetch with that same dog, scritching her behind her velvety little ears. If Naughty Dog makes you feel bad enough, maybe next time you won’t do ... the thing the game forces you to do?  The Last of Us Part 2 delivers these moments of emotional whiplash over and over again. If you ever feel good, victorious, or strong at any moment while playing this game, just know that you will later be feeling very, very bad, and it will happen very, very soon. This effect is mirrored in the game’s combat design, which echoes the story’s themes by repeatedly shoving you away from power, and toward fear, uncertainty, and weakness.  The combat in The Last of Us encouraged you to explore an area slowly, scrabbling for resources in abandoned buildings while staying hidden from potential threats. It was always better to attack enemies one at a time, whenever possible. Not much has changed in that respect, although the difficulty spikes are much smoother this time around, making the experience feel a lot less punishing, at least mechanically. Ellie is a tiny, terrifying gymnast; she’ll leap from a hidden spot in the grass to slice open an enemy’s throat or crowbar their head open, exuding all the cold precision of a lifelong killer. She’s quick and methodical, covering ground in seconds if she has to by jumping, climbing, smashing through windows, squeezing through crevices, and pulling dumpsters up next to rooftops to better traverse less-than-hospitable areas. In houses and structures, she’ll find small caches of ammo and resources that she can cobble together into health packs, trap mines, and so on. Ideally, planning will always beat passion, as there’s little more satisfying than setting up a couple of trap mines, throwing a bottle at a horde of infected humans to incite their wrath, and letting them walk right into your death cave. A close second would be nailing a silent headshot with the bow and arrow, or perhaps just sneaking up on a series of clueless, shambling infected people and taking each one’s wallet (that is to say, ammo or bandages) as you go down the line, chuckling all the way to the bank.Ellie’s abilities strain at the seams whenever you alert a group of enemies to your presence, though, so it’s best to avoid doing so. A petite teen girl like Ellie gets her most methodical murdering done by hiding in the shadows, taking on opponents in turn, as opposed to charging into the fray, guns blazing.  Still, Part 2 will sometimes railroad you into a battle with a bunch of opponents who’ll come at you simultaneously, or it will throw a couple of big and formidable enemies your way that can’t be beaten through stealth or cleverness. These moments look cool, since they’re splashy set-pieces, but they almost never feel good to play. Not when compared to the moments in which Ellie can plan out her whole attack from the shadows and then unleash it like a trained, capable assassin.It’s the rhythm of the game’s narrative, and how it impacts your tactical choices, that keeps you from ever getting the upper hand. Part 2 includes several flashbacks, and the story is often told out of order, so the version of Ellie you’re controlling may not have access to the weapons or abilities you’re used to. This was annoying at first, but I’d get the hang of whatever new weapons or items I could access within a few minutes. I learned, over time, never to get too comfortable with any of my setups or loadouts before the game took it all away from me. The designers always seemed to want to knock me back down a peg whenever the violence or combat began to feel too good. It makes sense conceptually. This isn’t a world where things are yours to keep; this is a world in which you find what you can and use it for as long as possible before it breaks or you find something better. This frequent shifting ensures that Ellie stays forever in danger. Naughty Dog did something fascinating with the game’s difficulty levels, however, giving the player a huge number of options about how they’d like to play. There’s no catch-all “easy mode” or “hard mode,” but rather a collection of settings you can turn up or down. You can adjust your allies’ health, for example, or increase the number of items Ellie finds while scavenging, while still leaving the enemies just as strong. Or you can go in the opposite direction, and decide you want to fight more able enemies and find fewer resources. If one encounter’s giving you trouble, you can bump enemy strength down right then and there, then change it back once you’ve gotten past the area giving you problems. You can save the game, or load an old save, at any time. This ability to almost roll your own difficulty level makes Part 2 significantly easier to play than its predecessor, if you need, or want, it to be.It will, however, be just as emotionally draining. There is no accessibility slider for that.Much of the game’s story revolves around the aftermath of the decision Joel made in the hospital at the end of The Last of Us — not in terms of the big-picture ways in which it affected the entire planet, but rather, the extremely micro ways in which it has affected the personal feelings of Joel, Ellie, and a few other characters, as each of them learns the truth. The problem is that Part 2 becomes torture to play if you already disagree with Joel’s decision, or, heck, even if you just had some doubts about whether it was the right call. “Feel bad about the fact that you’re doing all of this,” the creative team seems to whisper to you, again and again, describing things I already didn’t want Ellie to actually do, but had no choice in if I wanted the game’s story to continue. I was never given any other options, but that didn’t stop the game’s writing for blaming me for its own story. Would the designers feel better, would I be less complicit, if I just refused to buy or play the game at all?This game couldn’t exist if Ellie could just let go, or learn to meditate, or find a cognitive behavioral therapy workbook, or something. This is not a story of healthy humans finding happiness and building a community together, nor is it a story about someone who learns to love and trust others again despite experiencing absurd levels of trauma and loss. It is a story of a young woman who learned the wrong lessons from her surrogate father, and thus believes the ends justify the means. And the means will almost always include inflicting violence on others. Ellie embraces the role of antihero, just as Joel did, and Naughty Dog makes its queer woman protagonist act just as violent and self-involved as the legions of grizzled straight-white-dude video game protagonists who have preceded her. There’s something that feels off about that straightforward swap here; it’s a missed opportunity to explore how the rage of a marginalized character might take on a different form, and what that form may look and sound like. I felt so much hope at the idea of embodying Ellie instead of Joel in this game, but the entire arc she follows was an arc that I easily could have imagined Joel taking instead of her. That felt disappointing, but not entirely unrealistic. Self-absorbed white teenage lesbians certainly exist, and they’re out there, wearing Chucks and writing mediocre poetry in their journals, just like Ellie does in this game. All the other characters seem like real people, too, even if they might make some shitty choices. But hey, people make shitty choices. It’s kinda what real people do. Part 2’s naturalistic dialogue, bespoke animations, and exploration of subtle body language allow it to cut much deeper when, inevitably, several of these folks die in gruesome, arguably needless ways.And why? Sure, the real world is brutal and horrific, and this post-apocalyptic fictional world, all the more so. Yet humans can learn and they can change, and that’s what makes a story satisfying, even if it’s a sad one. I wanted these characters to realize and overcome their flaws, to transform in some way, however small. But, again, Part 2 doesn’t tell a story about that. It tells a story about a cycle of violence that no one can escape, and especially not me, the person playing the game. Ellie is trapped, somehow unable to grow, learn, or change, and I’m stuck with her.The writing in The Last of Us Part 2 emphasizes that even the most justified of grievances can grow like a cancer and destroy us, if we let it. That’s the story that the game wants to tell — a story of someone infected by something they don’t have the tools to stop. It makes poetic sense, given that the game is about a brain-eating fungus, as it turns out that Ellie doesn’t need to be infected to turn into an absolutely monstrous killing machine.  But when the game gave me more and more information about Ellie’s opponents, painting them as fully realized humans who also deserved to live, the effort felt wasted. I was already convinced that Ellie was handling things the wrong way, and that Joel had made a terrible mistake in the first game. The Last of Us Part 2 didn’t need to force me to kill a dog in order to get me to see that it’s bad to kill dogs. But, of course, it still made me do that. Just to be sure I really got it. I felt annoyed, not reflective. Like, come on, you think I need this much convincing? Does Naughty Dog think we’re all out here killing dogs, unaware that doing so is a horrific cruelty? This story seems to think I need to experience ridiculous levels of virtual violence in order to believe that maybe, just maybe, Ellie should have learned a little more about her enemies’ personal situations and motivations before slamming a baseball bat into their skulls.Playing The Last of Us Part 2, a game that supposes that humans will enact violence upon one another to their dying breaths, is a very strange thing in 2020. Naughty Dog created a world in which people across America react to a massive structural crisis by dividing and disconnecting from others, rather than uniting together to demand something better — not just for themselves, but for the most marginalized people in their communities. I see a widespread level of selflessness and an intense care for the preservation of human life in the real 2020, in fact, and an increasingly loud demand for a society that meets that need. Our systems have failed, in large part, but individual people remain strong and kind. Things have rarely been worse, but there is hope to be found in the actions of average folks fighting to do the right thing. We don’t need a video game to rub our noses in hatred and violence to know that other people who are just trying to survive aren’t the real enemy.The Last of Us Part 2 depicts individual people who are instead ruthless, capable, yet self-absorbed, and whose perception of violence is limited to how it affects them and their chosen family members. They are almost unbelievably unable to see the bigger picture. Part 2 ends up feeling needlessly bleak, at a time when a nihilistic worldview has perhaps never been less attractive. Its characters are surviving, but they’re not learning, and they’re certainly not making anything better. Maybe the most surprising thing that The Last of Us Part 2 offered me was the surety that, while the game was made with great skill and craft, we are actually much, much better than Naughty Dog thinks we are.

The Last of Us Part II,Riley MacLeod,Kotaku,https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-the-kotaku-review-1844006193,"Everything in The Last of Us 2 takes work. Every weapon reload, killing blow, and crafted item takes time and button presses. At times the game is painfully slow; even in the most action-packed sections you put in effort to move things forward. You’re paid for this work in a grim story and explicit violence. It can be exciting and beautiful, but mostly I just felt like shit.This piece originally appeared 6/12/20. We’ve bumped it today for the game’s US release.The Last of Us 2, out June 19 for PlayStation 4, is a sequel to Naughty Dog’s dark 2013 sort-of-zombie adventure The Last of Us. It’s a third-person game where your character is trying to exact revenge, but infected ex-humans and warring militias keep getting in the way. You can deal with these obstacles by sneaking past them, but more likely than not you’ll end up fighting them with limited ammo, improvised weapons like trip mines and pipe bombs, and a thrown brick or two. Its main setting of a post-apocalyptic Seattle is huge and challenging to navigate—when you aren’t fighting, you’re pushing debris out of the way, squeezing through gaps, and crawling under rubble. This gives the game a sense of effort and scale that make traversing a few city blocks feel like a huge adventure, but it’s also exhausting.As suggested by interviews with its creators and its own marketing, The Last of Us 2 is meant to feel very, very bad. Director Neil Druckmann has touted the game, as he described in one video, as “a commentary about the cycle of violence” and a game that asks “philosophical questions” about revenge and consequences. Pre-release marketing made it clear the game would be a divisively violent, difficult experience. Going in, I wasn’t sure I wanted a game that asked me questions about the consequences of my actions, since I live in the world we all find ourselves in now, where I’m hyper-aware of the fact that a careless cough in the grocery store could kill someone I’ve never met. I knew it would be hard to play, especially now. I knew I probably wouldn’t enjoy it in any traditional sense.My playthrough of The Last of Us 2 felt terrible to experience. Over the course of my 27 hours with the game, it grew to the point of feeling nearly unbearable. This wasn’t because it asked me hard questions about my own capacity for harm or revenge, or pulled some Spec Ops: The Line-style moralizing about video game violence. Despite Druckmann’s promised “philosophical questions,” I never felt like the game asked me anything. Instead, it told me “brutality,” repeatedly and louder, until by the end I couldn’t hear what it was trying to say at all. Characters make hideous, irredeemable choices, over and over. Everybody suffers, physically and emotionally, in graphic detail. This is all intended to prove a point, but the only point I got from the game was simply to be required to stare at violence, and play through violence, and then do that again, and more, and again, and more.A lot of this violence is just run-of-the-mill games violence, the kind I honestly don’t spend a lot of my time worrying about. The game’s world has been overtaken by a fungal infection that’s turned most of the population into zombies called Infected. They’re half-monster and half-plant, and they come in varieties that require different strategies. They’re terrifying and beautiful, and you respond to that beauty by knifing them in showers of blood and listening to them writhe and scream when you light them on fire with explosives. You also kill a lot of human enemies, whom the developers have given names and friends, and whose beliefs have led them to join one of two factions: the militant Washington Liberation Front or the religious Seraphites. Despite the factions’ ideological differences, they all die the same when you shotgun them in the face or nail them with an arrow. They cry in fear or call for the friends you’ve either killed or are about to. One faction has scent-tracking dogs—who you’ll also kill—who whine over their dead masters.You’re supposed to feel bad about this—in his preview of a section of the game, Kotaku’s reporter Nathan quoted narrative lead Halley Gross (known for her work on HBO’s Westworld) as saying of combat, “So much of what we’re trying to do is create empathy for the other. We make this enemy, and then how do we make you feel for them?” But the game’s story has so much more violence, so much more suffering that plays out over multi-stage quests and long cutscenes and effortful quicktime events, that I lost the ability to care about these everyday acts of carnage or whether I could have avoided them. There was only one combat moment in which I actually felt a moral qualm about killing enemies. I tried to avoid it, but as soon as my stealth attempt failed, I just shot my way through the survivors. This is perhaps a commentary—that it’s easier to inflict harm to get what you want than not—but by that point the game’s violence had worn me down so much that even these characters with names and friends and pets were just more virtual bodies on the pile.If you’ve read this far into the review looking for more details about just what this game is about, there’s a catch. Even though many of the game’s plot details were unexpectedly leaked via a hack in late April, a condition of us being able to review the game a week early with a Sony-provided copy is that we can’t spoil certain things. There’s plenty in the game I wouldn’t have spoiled anyway, since it’s full of events that are meant to surprise. And I can say that, having dug into those leaks, there was plenty in the game that surprised and shocked me. But key parts of the game’s story are off-limits here—not just how the game ends, for example, but also how it begins—as are large portions vital to explaining why I felt how I did about it. People who’ve seen the leaks may know some of this—though not all—but for the purposes of this review, there’s a whole lot to talk around.The original The Last of Us told a story that felt small and human, whereas the second tells one of all-consuming vengeance. In that first game, a gruff middle-aged smuggler named Joel has to shepherd a 14-year-old girl named Ellie across the post-apocalyptic United States. Ellie is immune to the outbreak, and Joel is taking her to a medical base to see if her immunity can help create a vaccine. In the game’s astonishing ending—spoilers?—when Joel learns that making the vaccine will kill Ellie, he murders the doctor and takes her from the hospital. He lies to her about what happened, telling her a cure is impossible. The player is left wondering if Ellie believes him in the game’s last moments.The Last of Us 2 begins four years after that moment, 25 years into the outbreak. Joel and Ellie, now 19, live in a settlement in Wyoming. They’re estranged from each other, and their interactions are sorrowful and tense. Ellie’s life is grim, but it has safety and goodness too. When the game starts, she’s recently shared a kiss with a woman named Dina, an event Naughty Dog showed in the game’s E3 2018 gameplay trailer. In the early hours, players get a glimpse of Ellie and Dina’s lives. They go on patrol for Infected; they smoke a joint; they have sex; they start falling in love.The characters are diverse, covering a range of genders, sexualities, and ethnicities. The game handles all of this well, neither downplaying it nor drawing undue attention to it. In a masterful scene, Ellie and Dina both share secrets; as a queer player, it felt wonderful to see queer characters confess things other than their sexuality. While I don’t consider representation alone an accomplishment, I appreciated the diverse cast. The game doesn’t make any big statements about it, which feels like the right choice—different kinds of people exist, and they face the game’s world, good and bad, like everyone else.Despite the things in Ellie’s life that are going well, what happened at the hospital haunts her, and it strains her relationship with Joel. The lie eats at them both, whether they know it’s a lie or not. Joel struggles with the consequences of his choices; Ellie struggles to trust him while wrestling with her immunity to the outbreak and what good it could have done. There’s a way in which she’s untouched by the problem everyone else is having—she can’t get the disease that has taken so much from the world—but, as the player knows, any possibility that she could have done something about it is long dead.I would have gladly played a version of The Last of Us 2 that explored these themes, that, like the first game, focused on the very human struggles of its characters set against a grim and brutal world. But that’s not the game we get. Inevitably, a violent tragedy ensues in Jackson. (That’s all I can tell you about it for now.) Ellie sets off on a revenge quest that consumes the rest of the game, which sends you to Seattle, puts you between two warring groups, and—those restrictions again!—escalates in gruesome ways.The game sends you on its revenge quest in a way that feels both narratively relentless and physically slow. In the early parts of the game, there are long stretches between combat and narrative in which you laboriously pick your way through the ruins of Seattle. By the middle of the game, I was fighting through consecutive tense areas that took time to navigate, and I’d long for a breather so my heart could stop pounding. Other times, something terrible would happen, only for me to be thrown back into combat without a moment to take it in. Tragic story events happened one after another. The game is divided into chapters, but events sometimes escalate without offering a natural stopping point, pushing me on even as I recoiled from what I’d witnessed.Almost every moment in The Last of Us 2 is hard. Much like in the first game, it takes forever to get anywhere, and so many objects in your way need to be lifted, pulled, and pried via button presses. Here, you can also crawl under things, squeeze through tight gaps, and throw and climb ropes, which you have to slowly gather one coil at a time. The obstacles in the first game created a pace that made sense—you were traveling across the country, after all—and here the new and old features combine evocatively with the size and wilderness of Seattle to make it feel treacherous. While The Last of Us 2 never quite pulls off the beauty of the original’s giraffe moment, the nature that’s overtaken Seattle is gorgeous and awe-inspiring. Rapids crash through what used to be downtown streets, trees tower overhead, and the damp, lush greenery feel both prehistoric and so much like the Pacific Northwest. Nature also makes progress difficult; I often hit so many dead ends and overgrown areas in my journey toward a waypoint that I lost all sense of my initial destination until dialogue or a prompt reminded me.Combat seldom picks up the pace. It works fairly similarly to the first game: you’re neither a tank nor a ninja. You’re always outnumbered, and ammunition and crafting parts are in painfully short supply. You can improve your odds a bit via several skill trees, which are unlocked with findable manuals and upgradable with findable pills. There are skills that give you more health, make you move faster when prone, or let you craft more quickly. You can also upgrade your guns at workbenches using scavenged parts, reducing sway or increasing damage. All of this necessitates scavenging, which you’ll also need to do to find parts to craft pipe bombs, molotovs, and certain kinds of ammo. This search draws out combat moments: you’ll kill a few enemies, detour to rummage through drawers for supplies, hide somewhere to craft, and then head back to the fight. I enjoyed this pace, even when it made me ache for an encounter to be over.“What if every terrible thing you can think of, but more of it?”Misery simulatorUniquely slow pace, beautiful natureViolence and suffering overwhelmed the story, felt like brutality simply for the sake of it Naughty DogPlayStation 4June 19, 2020About 27 hours for a full playthroughYour best bet in combat is to sneak around picking off enemies one by one, aided by the “listening” ability that lets you see their outlines through walls. You can hide behind cover, or go prone in grass, but none of this is quite as sharp as it would be in a true stealth game. In most of my battles, something inevitably went wrong and multiple enemies would rush me. In these moments, I had better luck running frantically than standing my ground, where scarcity made head-on battles difficult and wasteful. Combat went the best for me when enemies would come to investigate a downed colleague and I could pick them off individually, or when they were far enough apart that I could take them down unseen. In these instances, I’d fall into a compelling rhythm of sneaking and grabbing. But then a particularly dangerous Infected would appear who’d require too much attention or ammo, or I’d run out of crafting materials necessary to keep fighting, or the door I’d finally made it to was locked and I knew it would be another real-world hour before I moved the story forward. None of this is bad—it’s a feel unique to The Last of Us, combining some of my favorite sensations of survival and stealth games—but it wore me out. As the game grew more difficult to stomach, the pace of the combat sometimes felt like punishment. I’d long to be done with what I was experiencing, only to have no choice but to trudge through it.If The Last of Us 2 was just a game where its story unfolded between characters while you played slow combat and explored nature, I would have found it fine. If it kept the emotional weight of the original, the relatable ways the characters’ relationships formed and dissolved, it would have resonated with me the way the first game did. I played that game for the first time with friends on release day; one of my friends, a comedian, did most of the playing as the weekend wore on. She made such great jokes while she did—the hilarious internal monologue she spun for Joel sticks in my memory seven years later—but as we played, the jokes faded out. We both sobbed at the end. It felt like we’d shared something incredibly special, an experience a game had never given us before. I’ve played the game on my own since, as well as the Left Behind DLC, but they’ve never affected me as much as seeing the original’s final moments for the first time.The Last of Us 2 didn’t give me any moments like that. In the above-quoted video, Druckmann says the core of the game is about “these really intimate, intense relationships.” I bring this up not to quote the game’s marketing, but to try to understand what the people who made it thought they were doing. The story I experienced was about relationships only insofar as characters did things to each other. I didn’t learn anything about what it means to be human, or what we’re capable of when we’re hurt, or what can happen when we want to hurt others. The way Joel hurt Ellie in The Last of Us felt relatable to me; even if the fate of humanity has never hung in the balance, I know how it feels to make a desperate, selfish choice to hang on to something you love. The Last of Us 2’s amount of cruelty and violence ultimately overwhelmed any chance of that relatability here. I didn’t find it prurient—the game doesn’t relish in its gory deaths or emotional suffering. It just takes every opportunity to show them, over and over, and decides that counts as saying something about them. It showed me so much ugliness, and in such detail, that I felt numb as terrible things befell more characters I cared about. Sometimes I did these terrible things myself, through gameplay. Sometimes I just watched things play out in front of me with no say in the matter, a lack of agency that was so skillfully used in the first game. Neither circumstance felt more affecting than the other; both just felt like more. The game’s diversity, which I appreciated at the beginning, just felt like an equal opportunity for different kinds of people to suffer as the game went on. Eventually, my numbness turned to an anger I’ve never felt about a video game. Late one night, I paused the game and asked myself aloud if the developers thought I was stupid, if they thought the existence of violence had just never occurred to me before.It’s difficult to talk about all of this a week before most of you reading can play the game for yourself. In a recent fawning piece in British GQ, Druckmann is quoted as saying, “There were people [at Naughty Dog]—a minority of them—that were just stuck on how violent it [the game] is and how dark and quite cynical it is about mankind.” That even the people who made the game are divided about it is a clear sign that players are going to have radically different experiences. The first game’s story was polarizing; this one’s will clearly be as well. So many people worked on this game for so long, and at such cost, that I want The Last Of Us 2 to be more than the experience I had. It’s a visually beautiful game that feels distinct to play, and the story it tells and how it tells it, at the most basic level, certainly pushes the edges of what games have done before. None of those accomplishments elevated or redeemed it for me. Like the nature consuming Seattle, or the outbreak consuming humanity, its ugliness overshadowed everything else. "
The Last of Us Part II,Kat Bailey,USgamer,https://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-last-of-us-part-2-review,"“An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind.”
This adage about revenge is even truer in a world ravaged by cordyceps: a parasitic fungus that takes over human physiology, mutating people until their heads pop like corn, folding eyes under flaps of skin and growth, leaving hosts gnashing and clawing in the dark. If humanity can’t unite, these eyeless horrors will inherit the Earth.The Last of Us is a character study of a smuggler and a survivor - Joel and Ellie - trekking across post-apocalyptic America. The original game opened with Joel’s daughter being killed, and he carries the guilt of being unable to save her across the US with him as emotional baggage. He offloads that baggage onto Ellie, a teenager who’s immune to the outbreak - his self-appointed surrogate daughter. By the end they share a Stockholm Syndrome-esque affection, bonded through shared trauma.




Watch on YouTube    
Once they reach the Fireflies - a group who claim they can fashion a cure from Ellie’s DNA - Joel discovers the procedure will kill her. He assaults the hospital, guns down the surgeons, and escapes with Ellie still sedated. When she wakes, he says they just ran some tests and discharged her. He lies. The Last of Us Part 2 deals with the consequences of both the killings and the lie.Fans of the original might be concerned that forcing a story with such a perfect ending to continue would tarnish the original’s legacy. Fortunately, that isn’t the case. This is a companion piece that manages to introduce new characters and themes while also making the original story stronger simply by existing. Conversations that you’ve forgotten take on new meaning, beloved characters become more nuanced. When it ends, it imprints the same satisfaction of a story well told, packaged within Naughty Dog’s best game.It opens with Joel talking to his brother, Tommy. “I saved her,” he says as the camera cuts to a bloody hospital corridor filled with bodies. Three syllables explain how Joel justifies himself. He didn’t kill them, he rescued Ellie. But he stripped away her agency, and he knows he’s no hero.Where the original game opened with explosions, this prologue is more understated, poignant. It’s a story about facing the consequences of your actions, how everyone finds their inner strength in a different place, and how revenge can spiral out of control until you lose everything.We play as Ellie four years on from the lie, living some semblance of a normal life in the walled town of Jackson. Joel occasionally visits her cabin to tell her dad jokes. She listens to music on a cassette player, and a lava lamp bubbles away on her desk. Sketches and posters litter the walls of her room. In Joel’s cabin, there’s woodwork tables, wooden carvings, and family photos. On his bedside table sits a pair of reading glasses and a book, An Idiot’s Guide to Space - his way of attempting to rekindle their paternal relationship. The world is stuffed with little details like this that enrich the story and reward your curiosity.It is the morning after the winter dance and Ellie's getting ready for patrol. She gets her backpack, grabs her pistol, and cocks the slider with a yawn. She doesn’t curse under her breath when people get curb stomped anymore - violence is normalised, and this is just an ordinary day. Until it isn’t.The main story takes place over three days, as opposed to the four seasons structure of the original. At the same time, it jumps back and forth from the past to the present, introducing characters you initially hate before making you fall in love with them. It manages to be hopeful, bleak, funny, sad, peaceful, and frightening, running the gamut of human emotion, but masterfully paced out so you’re never overwhelmed.Every character is complex and human. It might be Naughty Dog’s biggest game, but it’s the studio’s leanest script - you’re trusted to understand subtext. The dialogue has an almost surgical precision to it. It also does things I’ve never seen before, in ways only video games can. It is a generation-defining masterpiece.There’s a structural pattern that’s similar to other Naughty Dog games, of course. You see a landmark, you head towards it, and you have pockets of adventure along the way. There are hub-style areas where you can explore optional buildings around Seattle, but the majority of the game is linear - tailored maps with multiple routes through ruined buildings, via underground train stations, and lush, overgrown parks. There’s surprising variety to the places you visit, though, and a strong sense of discovery, awe, and exploration, despite that linearity.There are tense stealth sections, huge battles, blood-curdling horror scenes, exciting chase sequences, three-way conflicts, moments of quiet exploration, and even environmental puzzles that aren’t just based on carrying ladders around.It builds slowly - it is hours before you fight any humans - with relationships and character growth at the fore. You pick through buildings and see the ghost of a world that’s alien to these young survivors, scavenging for supplies, ignoring the whiteboards filled with pitch-meeting notes and profit forecasts. It earns its action and that lends it more impact as a result.Things ramp up in intensity as the story goes on, but it’s interspersed with those aforementioned flashbacks. These give you room to breathe when the main story is going full throttle. In one, you explore a museum with Joel and Ellie. There’s no combat, just two characters bonding as you interact with props. It’s one of my favourite sequences in a game ever, and lands harder than any virtual bullet.It’s not something I expected going in, but The Last of Us Part 2 reminds me of Metal Gear Solid 5 mechanically. You spend much of the game laid prone in the grass, slithering between patrol routes. You cut through and around buildings, slip through small gaps, and hide under trucks and trains. It’s stealth that’s designed to keep you moving, to keep you reacting and improvising, to keep you clenching your jaw - and not just because you don’t want a bloater to rip it off.Level design is Naughty Dog’s best, each encounter offering multiple routes and opportunities for stealth, action, and a blend of the two. You’re constantly segueing in and out of stealth as you pick off enemies with guerrilla tactics. It makes you feel like a deadly hunter one minute and timid prey the next. The AI coordinates, using vantage points and pincer tactics, flanking and flushing out: they pull you by a leg as you hide underneath a truck; they sweep buildings like a SWAT team. It’s more dynamic than the original - unpredictable and exciting.In one scene, the two main enemy factions are fighting, one side standing in the flooded streets and the other in a ruined building overlooking the open space. I park my boat and crawl, fully submerged, through the knee-high water. The Seraphites, a group of religious fanatics who communicate via whistles (which are somehow more unnerving than the echo-location clicks from an infected) are winning. They’re raining down molotov cocktails on the WLF (or Wolves) below. Covered by the screams, I crawl onto a waterlogged bank, pull out my rifle, and take aim at a Seraphite through my scope. I pull the trigger and skull fragments explode from the back of his head, alerting the others.As I continue picking them off, I’m distracted by nearby splashing so I pull my eye from the scope to see two of them swimming at me, one from each side. I switch to my shotgun and take one of their heads off, using the last remaining shell to rip the leg from my other attacker. From the building, I hear their allies screaming their names.When I first played The Last of Us Part 2, I misunderstood the intent behind this. Every single human in this game has a name, and soldiers call out for their fallen friends and use names in idle chatter. I thought this was to make you feel guilty for shoving a switchblade into their neck, but it’s not just that.Naughty Dog names the enemies in The Last of Us Part 2 as a thematic choice. This is a story of revenge, and names remind you that these aren’t faceless drones: each person you kill could leave behind a loved one who might want payback. Good and evil is a matter of perspective in a lawless world where people act on survival instinct. It’s holistic - gameplay and story in harmony. Even a minigame where you pluck at the strings of a fully functional guitar serves a purpose in the larger tale.Every mechanic and story beat reinforces the themes. Combat is scrappy and messy. Incoming shots sometimes knock you onto your back where you’re free to return fire in a desperate effort. In one scene, Ellie kills someone who’s playing Hotline Miami on a PS Vita. She looks so ordinary, but she attacks you. It’s self defense. The next minute she’s bleeding out on the floor as the music from her portable console rings out. It’s fitting, because the aftermath of each battle reminded me of Dennaton Games’ indie hit.Hotline Miami features a repeating cycle of top-down violence punctuated by a slow walk back through that carnage, over bodies and through corridors painted in blood. It wordlessly asks you to reflect on your violent deeds.Here that same feeling translates to a 3D, photorealistic scene. Bodies lay limp with jaws ripped from their face, teeth missing, blood spilling from the exit wound. Shoot someone with an explosive arrow indoors and a chunk of flesh might stick to the ceiling and drip down in the aftermath - a thick splash of liquid and unidentifiable body parts where a human once stood. Shoot someone in the throat and they die with a gargle, bleeding out and twitching as blood pools around them. It’s horrific, but it all works together to create a mood of unease.The brilliant acting makes everything land harder. When the characters cry out, you feel it. When they say one thing and mean another, you get it. Every little facial tic, every shaking hand - Ashley Johnson, Laura Bailey, Ian Alexander, and Shannon Woodward all put in the performances of a lifetime, but even most of the side characters leave a lasting impression.When the credits rolled on The Last of Us Part 2 I was still buzzing from the excitement of the final few hours. My loyalty shifted between characters. I grew to love who I hated and dislike who I loved. I laughed, I teared up. I felt anger and elation. It’s the new high water mark for video game characters and I can’t wait for everyone to see just how special it is. As soon as it ended, I booted up New Game Plus and I’m experiencing it again with my eyes open, the context of the finished story imprinting new meaning into those early scenes and characters. I’m not swiping in the dark anymore.Version tested: PS4 Pro - a review copy was provided by Sony. You're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!

Michael Leri 
The Last of Us’ ending was so sacred that just the mere idea of a sequel seems sacrilegious. Ambiguity as poetic as that is woefully uncommon and a follow-up could easily dismantle that purity. Instead of letting naughty dogs lie, developer Naughty Dog decided to make the inconclusive ending more conclusive with The Last of Us 2. This remarkably ambitious sequel shares some of the qualities of its predecessor, but, much like a host fighting a fungal infection, that same ambition has also taken over and turned the game into a shambling husk of its former self.ALSO: China gets The Last of Us 2 credit card — but the game isn’t likely to launch thereIt does take a while for the fungal infection to hit its peak as The Last of Us 2 pushes forward in addition to stumbling backwards. Combat holds most of this advancing momentum since many of its intricacies have been appropriately tuned to add to its tension without diminishing any of its established tenets.Those foundational bricks haven’t been dramatically rearranged but thoughtfully reinforced. Skirmishes still rely heavily on hide-and-seek strategies that give players plenty of ways to experiment and think tactically. Sneaking yields many options — some peaceful, others brutal — as you crawl around and eliminate or completely avoid the scores of foes that hunt you down. The open, circular level design and basic set of distraction and offensive stealth tools let you pick either path, too.Of course, these sneaky mechanics sit alongside traditional third-person shooting but falling somewhere in the middle between stealth and loud firefights is where The Last of Us has always made its mark. Aware and unpredictable enemies ensure that almost no plan goes off without a hitch, forcing you to improvise for your survival. Hurriedly chucking a brick at a nearby WLF soldier to safely get away or setting the perfect mine with your final bit of explosive material is a rush as you use your greater wits to match their greater numbers — a nail-biting thrill that only climbs as the difficulty does.And even though they are quite intelligent, calling out your specific location and flanking you every chance they get, they’re also not omnipotent gods like most other video game foes. They’ll lose you and are susceptible to traps; a realistic touch that allows for such an engaging fluidity between stealth and aggressive gunplay. The impulsive infected aren’t quite as cerebral and are more chaotic yet utilize the same strengths as the human fights without being a carbon copy of them.Arenas are also full of multiple rooms, buildings, and paths and when combined with the breadth of the weapons and aforementioned lively AI, fights are destined to play out differently each time and have unique hotspots. The powder keg of unique components is prime for player-generated stories as each of its disparate elements clash in a near infinite amount of ways.All of that has been carried over from the first game almost to a fault as familiarity can occasionally begin to rear its ugly, fungus-ridden head, yet its ability to slightly improve upon that unrivaled foundation acts as a cure for complete stagnation. Being able to go prone and slither around like a snake (or Snake) opens new places to hide from eyeballs and gunfire; a simple ability with two practical uses. Dodging is similarly a multi-use addition since it inherently makes melee scuffles less mashy and lets you evade a lunging Clicker or Bloater charge with relative ease, granted you can react in time.The Last of Us 2 sadly doesn’t have many new enemy types as it is boxed in by lore that already depicts the complete birth-to-death cycle of the infected. But the two main new additions do fit well into the established roster.Dogs keep you moving during stealth since they can sniff you out and can quickly hone in on you like furry homing missiles during alert phases. Shamblers are a mix of Bloaters and Clickers, striking an unoccupied middle ground between the two advanced mushroom monsters. In an otherwise almost identical lineup of enemies, both do a solid enough job of adding just one more factor to the already long list of systems that bounce off each other and make the combat so personal and rewarding.The absurd amount of customization makes the experience even more personal. Few, if any, games have as wide of an array of knobs and levers that let you fine-tune almost every moving part. While most of it is centralized around addressing different types of accessibility, this also carries over to the difficulty.Each pillar of the game from enemy damage, awareness, level of resources, and player health can be managed independently, letting players discover the type of experience they want the game to be. From players who want to make the stealth a tad easier to those who want to have more legible fonts, The Last of Us 2 is an empowering experience for almost every possible type of player because of these extensive options.None of these toggles can change the story, which is where the game takes its biggest swings and, subsequently, its biggest whiffs. The Last of Us 2 opts to tell a much longer and more complicated tale with a multitude of heavy themes that cover cyclical violence, the follies of revenge, how enemies are perceived and dehumanized, and more.Naughty Dog matches these lofty ideas with gameplay and creates empathy through the controller, marrying the strengths of the medium to the narrative. That even extends to the enemies as they’ll call out Debra’s name as you launch an arrow into their eye socket or cry over Steve as you blow his legs off, further assigning personal touches to random, faceless grunts.Conceptually, it’s an impressive feat. Interactivity is a strong method of bonding characters to the player and the studio’s remarkable attention to performances and animation help create a story with unparalleled production values. The money is on the screen and that never lets up over the 30 or so hours it takes to hit the end credits.However, those 30 or so hours act as a near-fatal bite to the story’s neck and are why many of these ideas are only conceptually engaging. Naughty Dog is a studio that is compulsively (and sometimes destructively) obsessed with perfection, aiming to give ample time to each of its ideas to allow them to grow and develop. Each one needs buildup in order to get a rightfully earned finale.But since there are so many threads, the game has to spend multiple hours building on every one of them in an attempt to tie each of those threads all into a satisfactory bow. The pacing takes a nail bat to the chest as it slogs through setup after setup after setup before it can even begin to get to any sort of payoff from the previously established beats. Reaching climaxes takes even longer as the dangerous and very lootable world encourages you to tiptoe through it, further delaying your narrative payoff as you scrounge for muddy rags and empty wine bottles.The Last of Us 2’s penchant for flashbacks is emblematic of these pacing issues. Both calm and intense scenes are frequently undercut by the urge to jump back and show how that moment happened as the flow is sacrificed by the constant urge for explanation. This happens repeatedly, too, and there are even flashbacks within flashbacks.And when the game is trying to examine so many topics, these introductory bits and blasts from the past pile up and result in a story that has too much going on. This is a little ironic since the beginning often meanders between scenes and fills time with seemingly anticlimactic main objectives. Admirable intent can’t make up for the lack of focus since with every new theme, character, or faction, another explainer — be it multiple gameplay sections or a trip down memory lane — is required.More story begets more introductory sequences which begets more story and so on. It’s like the ouroboros of storytelling, which is fitting because The Last of Us 2 feels similarly endless at times. Even the fantastic combat loop grows repetitive in much of the latter third since it, despite its core strengths and numerous upgrade paths, can’t endure and survive quite so many samey encounters.This added complexity is peculiar when compared to how its predecessor was so beloved for its simplicity. Joel and Ellie’s journey was straightforward at its core and found its depth within the cast members and their growth. Simple story, complex characters, as Creative Director Neil Druckmann likes to say.But this game has far too much story to be considered simple and too many people to meaningfully center in on. The Last of Us 2 confuses ambition for depth and drowns in those deep waters and doesn’t have the metaphorical wooden palette to safely traverse the waves.Many of the new characters aren’t even as immediately interesting either and that’s an issue since the game wants you to intimately empathize with almost everyone. Ellie’s trauma isn’t meaningfully explored until later on and her potentially engrossing relationship with Dina takes up so little screen time. She’s also not as plucky as she once was, which means there are fewer avenues for lighthearted quips to balance out the all-encompassing dread.Almost nobody else picks up that slack either. The new roster isn’t as endearing and lives in the shadows of Naughty Dog’s past iconic characters. None of them are outright unlikable yet few rise above anything more than well-animated and refreshingly diverse gluttons for punishment. The humanizing elements are there and the performances are nothing less than fantastic, but they lack the level of charm and personality that made characters like Tess, Bill, and Henry so memorable in the first game.In addition to more story, The Last of Us 2 has more environments as well and even though they too can slightly buckle underneath the game’s girth, they never cease being exceptionally gorgeous and among the PS4’s finest on a technical and artistic level. Realistic lighting, a steady frame rate, and immersive lack of visible load times allow its broken down environments to shine in all of their destroyed beauty. Greenery, spores, or flooding overtaking a nearly extinct society isn’t as new at this point, but it has never looked as good as this.Visual fidelity and a ridiculous attention to detail makes these places feel lived in in a way that surpasses the first title. Environmental storytelling is even stronger here as journals and collectibles paint a more vivid picture of those who have become Clicker chow. They’re small tales that reward vigilant, resource-hungry players who read each short note and demonstrate that the team is fully capable of telling brief yet effective stories.Most even revolve around simple environmental puzzles, which are surprisingly natural and test your practical problem solving skills. They’re not about pushing boxes, but paying attention to the world in ways that don’t feel overtly video gamey. It’s more immersive and fits within the game’s grounded aesthetic.The Last of Us 2 is grounded enough to still contain plenty of traces of its former self. Its stealthy combat loop inspires frenetic yet tactical behavior through its smart enemy AI and resource management that is prime for compelling player-driven stories. The slick presentation and sheer visual fidelity are among the best on the PS4 as its characters and environments are elegantly detailed regardless of their apocalyptic backdrop.However, the fungus spreads as the game progresses and is where it begins to lose its identity. The first half’s semi-aimless and methodical pacing drags in its latter half as it bites off more story than it can comfortably chew and then spends too many hours trying to flesh out each one of its many beats.This excessive padding and theoretically noble attempt to dive into deeper subjects also negatively impacts the gameplay, too, as even its ace combat mechanics can’t quite stay fresh and exciting when repeated that often over the span of 30 hours. What’s left is a Bloater that’s forsaken enough of its soul to only just barely still be recognizable in its current form, shuffling around and proving that, unlike Ellie, it is not immune to devolving into a lesser form of itself.GameRevolution reviewed The Last of Us 2 on PS4.

The Last of Us Part II,Chris Carter,Destructoid,https://www.destructoid.com/stories/review-the-last-of-us-part-ii-592974.phtml,"darkDespite playing every one of their recent award-winning games, I still can’t believe Naughty Dog went from “the Crash Bandicoot company” to a cornerstone of the age-old “games are art” conversation. Every once in a while when looking at Joel or Nathan Drake, I imagine Crash going “Booyah Grandma.”But that just goes to show you how impactful Naughty Dog really is when it comes to the wide world of gaming. Crash, Jak and Daxter, Uncharted, and Last of Us all made big splashes when they were released and arguably have enduring appeal (I’m going to bat for the first few Jak games here).Last of Us Part II is no exception, improving what its predecessor did all those years before it.The Last of Us Part II (PS4)Developer: Naughty DogPublisher: SonyReleased: June 19, 2020MSRP: $59.99Kicking off with essentially recapping the ending to the first game, Part II feels like a true continuation. There’s no weird esoteric side tangent from an unnamed character to parse: it hits the ground running and tells a cohesive emotional story with Ellie at the helm. Ashley Johnson is still fantastic as Ellie all these years on, and she has a whole lot more to work with in the sequel as she delves further and further into the survivor identity that Joel has molded her into.A lot has changed since the first game was released in 2013 (!), and Naughty Dog was able to marry recent technological advances with nuanced emotional storytelling in a meaningful fashion. It sounds hyperbolic, but much like a performance in a prestige film or television series, microexpressions and simple acts like lip smacking add a human element to Part II in a way that many other games have only tried to accomplish. You know how you start to notice a significant other’s idiosyncrasies over time, for better or worse? I experienced that very tangible and human sensation with most of Part II‘s cast.Beyond the impressive full-body performances from the cast, credit goes to Last of Us boss Neil Druckmann and his co-directors Anthony Newman and Kurt Margenau, who really draw the most out of the talent and allow the camera to linger in a way that captures the emotion of each scene. While many moments in the original Last of Us were filler-oriented, the sequel’s script is mostly meat. Sometimes scenes are very low key, but those moments actually matter, with dialogue containing themes that echo throughout the story in more subtle ways.The splendor of the environments augments those performances. By resisting the urge to go fully open-world, Naughty Dog was able to meticulously design chapter-based sandboxes, making them feel cohesive, but not overwhelming. Although they’re arguably too linear in some cases (more on that in a moment), the zones often feel like characters themselves given how much personality they exhume. A few of them are absolutely burned in my brain and persist in my mind’s eye long after clearing the campaign. I can see them as clear as day.While that echelon of budget is what you’d expect out of a 2020 first-party production, gameplay-wise, Part II doesn’t really provide any surprises, or elevate the survival-action genre. And that’s mostly okay, as this is a character-driven game, even if it gets grating. There’s still lots of scripted moments with NPCs and some light QTEs (mainly mashing while grappling, that sort of non-annoying thing). Last of Us Part II also seems to have more “oh the door is locked, let’s find another way around” moments than any other game I’ve ever played. A clear-cut runner-up: portions where you’re strictly running forward, then holding the Triangle button to open a door at the end of a path.Picking up items and crafting them is still tedious given the stringent item limits and slow rate of acquiring new abilities, not to mention the so-so efficacy of some of the early-game items. Limiting ammo is fine as it fits with the post-apocalyptic theme — but there aren’t a whole lot of new ways to approach situations this time. Even so, it does all come together in the end when you’re actually engaging in stealth or combat. The dodge-heavy melee system is effective because of how brutal and simple it all is, as is the act of sneaking around and causing distractions.I think what Last of Us does really well as a series is hammer in the theme that you’re not a superhero, both physically and emotionally. That doesn’t mean it can’t be a power fantasy (this game is full of believable badasses), but the grounded nature of having to stab people in the neck while they squirm hits home more than most unattached stealth romps. More-so than the initial entry, The Last of Us Part II isn’t afraid to get dark, which includes rampant dog-murder.As someone who hasn’t eaten meat in many years, sometimes I find the prospect of even consuming flesh digitally unappealing (don’t freak out, it doesn’t stop me from playing or anything!), so dog killing can be fairly harrowing when it’s sparingly attempted by creatives. You might be freaked out by it, but that’s kind of the point — and it’s probably going to be the least controversial aspect of Part II. Not that it’s that controversial in the first place.You’re going to be freaked out a lot, actually, as Part II maintains a consistent level of tension far more than the original did. Part II is what I’d call “Worrying: The Game,” as its cast is thrown into the ringer multiple times, with a scant few cheap shock-value moments spliced in (among many that feel earned). Some arcs are rushed, but for the most part, I felt a genuine connection to the main cast and experienced an immense amount of empathy for them. While I won’t spoil the main beats here, suffice to say we will be talking about them soon enough.As a bit of housekeeping, there’s no multiplayer this time: and as far as options and tweaks go, Part II is one of the most welcoming AAA games to date. There’s a host of accessibility controls, plus you can swap the difficulty at any time. New Game+ (unlocked after one playthrough) allows you to replay the story with upgrades and items in tow, which is a more enticing prospect when you can fully customize the difficulty across multiple options. (You can beef your stats up while making enemies smarter or more perceptive if you don’t like bullet sponges — bravo.) There’s also a gallery with some great concept art, including a ton of designs that never made it into the game.Like the original Last of Us, some people are going to come away underwhelmed, but the story beats and the characters driving them are the main draw. Part II doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but it gives us a lasting glimpse of a unique broken world full of broken people that’s worth visiting time and time again.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]GreatImpressive efforts with a few noticeable problems holding them back. Won't astound everyone, but is worth your time and cash.

The Last of Us Part II,Paul Tassi,Forbes,https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2020/06/22/the-last-of-us-part-2-review-ps4-dig-two-graves/#6db03ed63ca9,"The Last of Us Part 2A review is only one person’s opinion on a game, and I think it’s pointless to go into one of these knowing nothing about the reviewer or the context.The Last of Us, the original, is one of my favorite games of all time. Joel and Ellie are two of my favorite characters.No, I did not get an early review copy of this game, which frees me up to talk about things like the entire second half of the game which was not allowed before embargo, and I think it’s an absolutely essential core part of the story to discuss.Yes, I have spent the last few days arguing with the entire internet about The Last of Us Part 2, so much so that I am already as exhausted as I was after two years of Last Jedi fighting.But I’m pushing past that now. I’m not going to keep diving into why exactly people are review bombing the game or the mob mentality behind it, all I can do here is explain why I played this game, even having it spoiled in many ways beforehand, and came out the other side loving it. Loving how it handles its old characters, growing and evolving them, loving how it introduces new ones, and loving how the dual perspective narrative makes for a revenge tale that is infinitely more interesting than the “check the minibosses and big boss off the list” series of levels that it could have been if it had stuck with Ellie the entire way.This will be a non-traditional review in that I do not think you should read the rest of it until you are at least a little ways into the game. Until you at least get to “the moment.” You’ll know which one.I have no idea how earlier reviews managed to dance around the entire impetus of the plot for their analysis, but I’m not going to bother with that here, particularly since the game has been out for a few days now, and most players are probably past this point.But yes, spoilers for an event in the first few hours of the game follow.We cannot talk about The Last of Us Part 2 without talking about the brutal death of Joel. It’s a moment that instantly turned off many players from the game, and I’m hearing echoes of “I stopped watching The Walking Dead after Negan beat Glenn’s head in,” right down to essentially the same manner of execution. I get that, but I think you should still keep going.The Last of Us Part 2Ellie and Joel have found a new home in Jackson, a small town that has weathered the apocalypse, and managed to fend off infected and a few unsavory human types as well. But that changes one day when a patrol goes awry. Joel and Tommy, not as distrustful of strangers as perhaps they were four years ago, rescue a woman, Abby, who you play as briefly. But then, once Joel introduces himself, things turn quickly.Abby and her group have been looking for Joel. This specific Joel. For a very long time. They capture him, torture him, and then ultimately, when Ellie finally arrives, Abby beats Joel to death with a golf club right in front of her.It is, unquestionably, heartbreaking. I loved Joel as much as anyone, which is why this moment works so well. You feel Ellie’s pain practically as much as she does, and that need for vengeance carries you through the story.And yet I did not find Joel’s death to be a surprise, as I always figured this was coming.Yes, this moment was indeed spoiled for me during the leaks by some rando on Twitter. If you’re as online as me, that was always going to be impossible to avoid for an entire month once the major leaks were disseminated.But past that, even from the first trailer, it seemed very clear that something had broken Ellie and she was going on a murderous rampage of vengeance. What else would have possibly happened to make her that angry besides some group killing Joel? Yes, the trailers tried to show Joel was alive, but back then I explained it away as him possibly being in her head. That isn’t what happens, but that footage is either from scenes before his death, flashbacks that happen after, or it was plainly doctored to throw people off (I did not love that tactic, in hindsight).The Last of Us Part 2I also remember that Joel did something that could easily be considered monstrous, murdered an entire hospital of people looking for a cure for the virus so he could save Ellie. It’s one of the most complicated moral decisions presented in a game, a decision that, mind you, the game did not actually let you make. This was Joel’s story. This was no ending you got to choose. It happened to you, and ultimately, through you, with the controller in your hand. The only way to avoid it was to shut the game off.People complain that Joel’s death was “weak” and “pointless,” and he should have gone out like a hero saving Ellie. But don’t you get it? He did die saving Ellie, just four years after he probably should have.Again, after this point, I was expecting a pretty stock tale of revenge. First, Tommy leaves, heading to Seattle to take on this “Washington Liberation Front” group, the ones who killed Joel. Ellie, and her new girlfriend Dina, follow shortly thereafter, and we get the fairly traditional “hunt down everyone who was present” structure, ultimately leading to Abby, the obvious “final boss.” But The Last of Us Part 2 is not content with that story. Not even close.I’ll pause the plotlines here for a minute to focus on Ellie’s actual gameplay as she explores Seattle. If The Last of Us suffers anywhere, it’s probably in some aspects of it…actually being a video game. Contrary to many fan opinions, I think the story is the strongest part of the game, followed by the performances and the sheer majesty of these digital environments that Naughty Dog (and its painfully overworked employees) have crafted here. It’s one of the most beautiful games I’ve ever seen, which is exactly what I said about Uncharted 4. And The Last of Us Part 1. And Uncharted 3. And so on. You get it, this is kind of Naughty Dog’s thing. But it never, ever fails to impress.Ellie pairs with various characters on her journey, sometimes Dina, sometimes others, though occasionally, she’s alone. When that happens, you miss the banter and the game is at its darkest. And sometimes dullest.Very, very little has evolved in terms of actual gameplay and mechanics here. The control scheme is definitely one of the most bizarre I’ve ever experienced in a game (R2 to reload? What?) but you get used to it eventually. I’d say Ellie controls less like a boat than Joel did, but the game is generous making its AI rather dumb and allowing you to silently kill an entire room of bad guys with your switchblade. I think combat is enjoyable enough, a mad scramble between stealth and loud, often incredibly brutal action, but at times I almost felt the game was far too easy on normal, and enemies lost your trail way too quickly if you fled even a short distance away. Even the new “dogs track your scent” mechanic doesn’t really do much other than make you feel extremely bad about killing dogs.The Last of Us Part 2I also still hate every single infected encounter in the game, like I did in the original, and tried to just blitz through them as fast as possible. The one exception was a cool infected boss fight way late into the game that I was not expecting, which was the only genuinely fun moment I’ve ever experienced with this series’ cursed mushroom zombies.I like the exploring, to a point. The game does make you feel like you need to search every nook and cranny, but it starts feeling a bit arduous the longer the game goes on. And it’s a very long game. There are select moments that you can trigger with exploration that are story relevant (one of the most touching bits of the game is a Dina/Ellie interaction early on that takes place in a random building you could easily miss), but later, this kind of stops happening and you’re just finding endless rolls of duct tape and single bullets sitting on tables. Like the first game, these sequences, whether it’s finding long, long ways around to locked doors, or trekking toward some giant landmark in the distance, can feel too long. I am not saying this game should not have gameplay, but there are many, many sequences that feel like they should be a lot tighter, like you’re reading a 1,500 page book or watching a five hour movie. Some editing would have worked well in some of these sections.But ultimately, yes, the game is fun to play. The environment design alone makes exploration worthwhile, however plodding it may become. And there’s nothing more gratifying than having a 5’4” girl take down a room full of lunatic cult members with two arrows, three revolver rounds and a brick.The violence…is violent. I understand that it may be a turn off to some, and if Naughty Dog’s signature is realism, that translates not just to environments and performance capture, but also its brutality. As someone who has been watching the goriest horror and action movies and shows in history for a few decades now, this didn’t really phase me. The lone exception was the dogs…which definitely made me wince. Yes, attack dogs have been enemies in video games before, but again, those encounters have never been this realistic, and that whimpering and whining and howling of brutally murdered German Shepherds will haunt my dreams.The Last of Us Part 2All in all, I feel almost identical about The Last of Us 2’s gameplay as I did the first game. It’s beautiful and brutal, but enemy AI, both human and infected, is not the best, and the pacing has its problems. And yet I loved the writing and characters and story so much all of that doesn’t really end up mattering all that much to me.Now we reach the turn, when we figure out that we’re not just playing as the Joel-murderer Abby for a brief segment, but rather, close to half the game. I’m talking a new skill tree, a new style of gameplay (while Abby can be stealthy like Ellie, she is usually better off plowing through people like a truck). And an entirely new perspective on not just this game, but the last one, too.I will stop short of getting into further spoilers here, as these happen late into the game, rather than Joel’s death which is at the beginning. I know that many people disliked playing as Abby in a game they thought they would just be switching between Joel and Ellie again. And much less playing as a character that murdered the character they wanted to be playing as.But I found it fascinating. Did I like Abby as much as Joel and Ellie by the end? Maybe not, but that wasn’t the goal. The point was to show that revenge stories are complicated, and often, never-ending and deeply unsatisfying. Some people just want Ellie to be John Wick and murder everyone who wronged her without a second thought. But The Last of Us 2 wants to see that Ellie’s “minibosses” are actual people, Abby’s friends. And if we’re going with the John Wick comparison, Abby’s the one whose dog gets murdered.It is not easy to confront the idea that the characters you have grown to love may not be good people. That was pretty clear in the last game with Joel’s hospital murder spree. Whether you want to justify that or not, it’s still brutal and highly debatable, given that it’s not just the Fireflies he killed, but potentially millions who could have benefited from a potential cure.But you’re also meant to question Ellie’s actions here, too. We are so used to just cutting through legions of bad guys in video games that we’re stunned when a game bothers to show us the other side. We don’t like it, it makes us uncomfortable. And yet by the end of the game, you should at least be able to appreciate the perspective that in Abby’s story, Joel and Ellie are the clear villains. And in Ellie’s case in particular, we have a new moral question, whether killing dozens, hundreds of people is worth seeking revenge for one man, a man who did do something who hurt a lot of people. Many players will scream “hell yes!” and cut through them all with glee. But I think the Abby storyline is what saves this game from being way, way too predictable and like every single other revenge tale out there, even though no, I don’t think the point is to make her out to be a hero either.The Last of Us Part 2The ending, which I won’t fully get into, has been criticized as “unsatisfying.” For me, it’s really the only way it could have ended. This entire game is a commentary on moral relativism (what I see as right and justified, you see as wrong and abominable), and the circular nature of vengeance (“Before you embark on a journey of revenge, dig two graves”). The ending, from that perspective, works. It’s kind of perfect, actually.This is a great game. One of the best I’ve played in years. No, I’m not going to go into GOTY nonsense in June, and no, I won’t be one of the 50 outlets giving it a perfect score, even though yes, I do believe you can give imperfect games 10/10s, given that nothing is completely without flaws. But The Last of Us 2’ actual gameplay leaves enough to be desired for me to take it out of contention for that.But it’s stunning. It’s important. And it’s a deeply well-told story to the point where I genuinely cannot fathom why anyone who has fully beaten the game, not just heard the spoilers, not just watched a streamer snark their way through it or watched ripped YouTube cutscenes, doesn’t appreciate what it has achieved here. But again, I can only offer my own opinion and my own defense of what I think is a must-play as a huge fan of the original, even as someone who loved the characters they’ve murdered and maimed and morally compromised here. It’s remarkable, and it will stay with me a long while, just like the first.Platform: PlayStation 4Developer: Naughty DogPublisher: Sony InteractiveReleased: June 19, 2020Price: $59.99Review Score: 9.5 out of 10"

Signup for a Free AccountAlready have an account? Login NowThe Last of Us Part 2 takes players back into the brutal, post-apocalyptic world that Naughty Dog first introduced in 2013. Is this sequel worth checking out, or do the notes fall flat? Our review.Have you ever heard a song that strikes you down deep? Each note that’s played upon the guitar strings and piano keys a haunting sound that reverberates in your mind for days, weeks, or even years to come. The Last of Us Part 2 is that song. A series of notes and chords struck perfectly together. Poignant narrative, brutal violence, and a bleak but realistic look at humanity all swirl together into a rippling tide that pulls the player under; constantly tossing and turning until it all reaches a dark and roaring crescendo.The Last of Us Part 2 picks up immediately after the events of the original, as Joel explains how he butchered dozens of Fireflies, and dashed Ellie’s hopes of curing the infection just to save her life. It’s a retelling of a very selfish tale, and one that will no doubt continue to haunt both he and Ellie for the rest of their lives.Fast forward a few years. It’s now been five years since Ellie and Joel returned to Jackson and set up camp in the settlement that Joel’s brother, Tommy, helped create. They’ve both found their own places within the community, and they’ve been doing the best they can to put the events from Saint Mary’s Hospital behind them. Things seem to be going pretty well for our beloved survivors. Joel and Ellie have grown closer, despite the secrets between them, and Ellie has even managed to make some friends along the way.Unfortunately, peace doesn’t last forever, and The Last of Us Part 2 is not a happy story. Soon Ellie and Joel find themselves thrust under the surface of a cruel and stormy sea, a dark and unrelenting riptide pulling at their feet. It’s a beautifully executed event that helps to shape the growth of multiple characters throughout the rest of the game.I’m not going to talk too in-depth about the story. There’s already been a ton of rumors and leaks, and I’m not going to add onto that pile. What I will say about the story is that there are things you won’t expect. Twists that you won’t see coming. There are a lot of things that don’t always make sense the first time you see them, but it all comes together in the end. You might not like everything that happens, or the consequences that come up throughout the story, but I assure you it all plays out in one of the most cinematic and beautifully haunting experiences we’ve seen offered in a video game. Ever.One of the most striking things about Naughty Dog’s post-apocalyptic series is the developer’s approach to violence and overall brutality. While the original had quite a bit of this brutality on display, the second chapter of Ellie and Joel’s story takes things up a notch, and then continues to turn the dial even higher. Stealth assassinations sound and feel realistic, offering a dark and bleak look at how our character’s approach their problems.The screams of infected and soldiers as the flesh burns from their bodies, the yelps from enemies as they watch their friends and allies die next to them, it all comes together in a nice package that helps to paint a bleak but realistic look at the end of the world. From the way the cities have begun to return to nature, dark green leaves painting entire sides of buildings in Seattle as you explore, the earth engulfing the world that mankind once thought it mastered.It's a dark and yet beautiful look at how things could be if something of that sort happened, and the upgraded visuals that Naughty Dog has on display in The Last of Us Part 2 only help to strike that beauty home. Each thing comes together like a different instrument in an orchestra, all working cohesively to tell a story through sound. It’s beautiful and yet disturbing to watch the way that humans destroy each other as Ellie takes on members of the Washington Liberation Front (often referred to as the WLF) and the Seraphites.  While the idea of two factions might not be very enticing to some players, each group offers their own challenges and different looks at the world that Ellie, Joel, and their friends inhabit. Whereas the WLF see the world as their oyster, a force that they can brutally beat into submission, the Seraphites work in more deceptive ways, using quiet attacks and vegetation to wreak havoc on their enemies. It all works together to showcase just how violent the world is.The combat system featured in the original returns, focusing heavily on cover and stealth as your main means of taking down enemies, though it is a bit more refined here. Of course, ammo is scarce in most instances, and while you’re more than welcome to run in shooting, the ability to craft items like arrows and smoke bombs open new avenues to take out baddies without alerting others in the area. But be careful, taking out an enemy might cause one of their friends to come looking for them.Arrows shot at you will stick into your body at times, forcing you to remove them or slowly bleed out. Shotgun blasts rip chunks from your enemies’ bodies, sending blood, bone, and flesh spewing across the walls and floors. Rounds from your rifle leave holes in the heads of your foes. Each shot feels like a hammer slamming down, granting the combat a nice chunky feeling that many other games fail to full deliver.Much like the original, The Last of Us Part 2 also has a much bigger story to tell than just Ellie and Joel’s. Notes left behind by survivors and soldiers tell of how wars and combat have changed them. Some notes connect to each other, telling a long and cohesive narrative as you move further through the game. It’s a really great touch that helps to make the world feel even more alive than it already does.That’s where the next big focus of the game comes into play. Where the original took more of a linear approach to storytelling and world exploration, The Last of Us Part 2 rewards players for looking in every dark cranny they come across. Safes, pieces of lore, and collectibles are abundant throughout the world, sometimes hidden in areas you might not think to explore the first time you look around at the new areas you enter.Long grass and tight hallways give way to new rooms that Ellie can use to get around enemies and conserve ammunition, though sometimes the game does thrust you directly into firefights without any way to avoid them. These moments are few and far between, and Naughty Dog has done a great job of making these instances feel less jarring to the player.From enemy bases to abandoned music shops, there are tons of environments to explore and navigate in The Last of Us Part 2. Each one is detailed and feels unique as you move through them, really helping to paint the picture that this is indeed a living, breathing world that the player is inhabiting. Unfortunately, this living, breathing world does come at a cost, and there were a few instances where triggered events wouldn't pick up correctly, forcing me to reload the save file to the nearest checkpoint to get things to click just right.Naughty Dog continues to build onto the world design by enveloping the player in a beautifully designed soundscape. The rush of wind moving past your head, the whiz of arrows raining down on you as you move from cover to cover, it all fits so well within the world. Glass crunches under your feet as you walk across it, the sound of running feet echoing through the dark corridors littered with infected. The sound design helps to paint a disturbing and haunting picture.Atmosphere isn’t the only sound design on display, though. As mentioned earlier in the review, the sounds that enemies make as they die, the gurgling of their blood in their throats as Ellie lodges her Switchblade deep within their necks, it all adds to the brutality that permeates the air in The Last of Us Part 2. This is a savage world, and recent events have shaped the previously innocent girl from the original game into a dark and disturbed mess. But her actions are not absolute. Her actions come with consequences, and as you dive deeper into the story, Ellie finds herself struggling more and more to face the reflection in the dirty windows that litter the abandoned Seattle storefronts.The Last of Us Part 2 is not for everyone. It is a dark and riveting experiment. A symphony of madness, revenge, and brutality. It is the song of humanity’s greatest darkness, and an absolute delight to partake in. The fine folks at Naughty Dog have outdone themselves this time around. The clever blend of cinematics and gameplay all come together perfectly to create an unforgettable experience that rivals some of the greatest classics in American cinema. All that’s left to do now is see it for yourself.This review is based on a code provided by the publisher.

					It definitely isn't going to be enjoyed by every fan ever. But I think if you can go into things with an open mind, then you have a lot higher chance of walking away in love with the story that Naughty Dog has set out to tell.				
					Beautifully written review! 				
					Thanks! :D				
					How close was it to a 10/10?				
					For me, personally, it is a 10/10. But we don't really do 10/10s here at Shack unless the game is like TOP TIER PINNACLE AMAZINGNESS that beats out every other game ever. We have a really, really high bar for that 10/10 score that I don't think any game could really hit at this point.				
					[deleted]				
					if 10/10 is practically non-existent, then doesn't that mean 9/10 is the top? this is some spinal tap goes to 11 stuff				
					To a degree, yeah. I don't know, it's a weird thing. I'm not saying that there won't ever be a 10/10 game here, but it's just going to take universal appraise from the entire team, I think. Something like that make sense? I'm running on little sleep still.  New puppy + review week of a huge game.				
					This is a weird gaming review thing I don't get.  Movies get 5 out 5 stars all the time and we know that doesn't mean it's citizen cane 2.0				
					Gamers complain a lot more than most other groups of people, though. 				
					[deleted]				
					I think the biggest thing here is that the team wants the 10/10 to really matter when it is given is all. But yeah, I'm not really a fan of review scores myself. I think that every game is going to have people that think highly of it and some that don't... even the really bad ones have people that enjoyed them.				
					Why did you change TLoU 2's score? It was originally a 10 and now is a 9. Also, Metacritic states that they don't change a publisher's first score, but they did				
					We didn't change our score. It has been a 9 since the review was written, edited, and then published. There was a mistake when the info was uploaded to metacritic, so they had to change the score there to reflect our actual score. 				
					Oh, thanks for clarifying that. I noticed that change from 100 yo 90 on Metacritic and got curioused. Anyway, good review.				
					Yup! No problem. Always happy to explain when things get confusing, haha. 				"

From a narrative perspective, there’s no real need for The Last of Us Part 2 to exist. The gripping, tightly paced, very human tale told by the first game is an almost perfect example of self-contained video game storytelling. That game’s ending—where the “hero” condemns the world to continuing disaster out of love for a companion he has slowly grown to love like a daughter, all while betraying her wishes and shielding her from the truth—is a deeply affecting and thought-provoking moment that has resonated with gamers for seven years now. The idea of adding anything to that quietly confident, freestanding narrative package feels superfluous at best and gratuitous at worst.Things pick up four years after the events of the first game in the amazingly calm settlement of Jackson, Wyoming. After the almost overwhelming death and decay of the first game, it’s a shock to be thrown into a thriving community full of electricity, commerce, gossip, food and drink, and even happily playing children. Small groups still regularly patrol the perimeter to keep the Infected at bay, but humanity, it seems, has gained a bucolic foothold.Ars tested the game on a PS4 Pro, which often whirred like a jet engine to keep up. Everything looks great in HDR, with high contrast lighting effects that shine especially well when you're using the flashlight in otherwise dark areas.In our playthrough, the game’s frame rate stuttered noticeably in a few busy scenes, but not enough to be a major hindrance. The game also crashed a couple of times during my roughly 25 hours of play time, but frequent and automatic checkpointing made this barely a nuisance (and post-release patches may fix some stability issues).The sense of a slowly returning normalcy is made all the more bittersweet because we know Ellie is fated not to enjoy it for long. The Ellie we see here is no longer the sweet, energetic, eager pre-adolescent who forged an endearing bond with gruff Joel through the first game, either. Time and knowledge have made her harder, more reserved, and more unforgiving than ever. By the time external circumstances and a drive for vengeance force her out of the comfort of Jackson and into a dangerous, murderous trek to Seattle, it’s not exactly a surprise.We do get occasional glimpses of the old Ellie, especially when she’s taking her first tentative steps into a truly adult relationship. Love interest Dina is a gently teasing foil for Ellie’s developing affections here, and their extended casual banter during the trip to Seattle brings to mind some of the best bonding moments between Ellie and Joel in the last game.These conversations take place amid the beautiful desolation of a city that has quickly been retaken by the nature surrounding it—a “Nature is healing” meme made vividly real. The environmental design in Part 2 is top notch, with every single location feeling like an actual, inhabited place that was fully built and then slowly left to rot. I could aimlessly wander the beautiful desolation for hours, picking out ominous touches of environmental storytelling even if I wasn’t scrounging for materials to ensure my in-game survival.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

The Last of Us Part II,Kirk McKeand,VG247,https://www.vg247.com/2020/06/12/the-last-of-us-2-review/,"“An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind.”
This adage about revenge is even truer in a world ravaged by cordyceps: a parasitic fungus that takes over human physiology, mutating people until their heads pop like corn, folding eyes under flaps of skin and growth, leaving hosts gnashing and clawing in the dark. If humanity can’t unite, these eyeless horrors will inherit the Earth.The Last of Us is a character study of a smuggler and a survivor - Joel and Ellie - trekking across post-apocalyptic America. The original game opened with Joel’s daughter being killed, and he carries the guilt of being unable to save her across the US with him as emotional baggage. He offloads that baggage onto Ellie, a teenager who’s immune to the outbreak - his self-appointed surrogate daughter. By the end they share a Stockholm Syndrome-esque affection, bonded through shared trauma.




Watch on YouTube    
Once they reach the Fireflies - a group who claim they can fashion a cure from Ellie’s DNA - Joel discovers the procedure will kill her. He assaults the hospital, guns down the surgeons, and escapes with Ellie still sedated. When she wakes, he says they just ran some tests and discharged her. He lies. The Last of Us Part 2 deals with the consequences of both the killings and the lie.Fans of the original might be concerned that forcing a story with such a perfect ending to continue would tarnish the original’s legacy. Fortunately, that isn’t the case. This is a companion piece that manages to introduce new characters and themes while also making the original story stronger simply by existing. Conversations that you’ve forgotten take on new meaning, beloved characters become more nuanced. When it ends, it imprints the same satisfaction of a story well told, packaged within Naughty Dog’s best game.It opens with Joel talking to his brother, Tommy. “I saved her,” he says as the camera cuts to a bloody hospital corridor filled with bodies. Three syllables explain how Joel justifies himself. He didn’t kill them, he rescued Ellie. But he stripped away her agency, and he knows he’s no hero.Where the original game opened with explosions, this prologue is more understated, poignant. It’s a story about facing the consequences of your actions, how everyone finds their inner strength in a different place, and how revenge can spiral out of control until you lose everything.We play as Ellie four years on from the lie, living some semblance of a normal life in the walled town of Jackson. Joel occasionally visits her cabin to tell her dad jokes. She listens to music on a cassette player, and a lava lamp bubbles away on her desk. Sketches and posters litter the walls of her room. In Joel’s cabin, there’s woodwork tables, wooden carvings, and family photos. On his bedside table sits a pair of reading glasses and a book, An Idiot’s Guide to Space - his way of attempting to rekindle their paternal relationship. The world is stuffed with little details like this that enrich the story and reward your curiosity.It is the morning after the winter dance and Ellie's getting ready for patrol. She gets her backpack, grabs her pistol, and cocks the slider with a yawn. She doesn’t curse under her breath when people get curb stomped anymore - violence is normalised, and this is just an ordinary day. Until it isn’t.The main story takes place over three days, as opposed to the four seasons structure of the original. At the same time, it jumps back and forth from the past to the present, introducing characters you initially hate before making you fall in love with them. It manages to be hopeful, bleak, funny, sad, peaceful, and frightening, running the gamut of human emotion, but masterfully paced out so you’re never overwhelmed.Every character is complex and human. It might be Naughty Dog’s biggest game, but it’s the studio’s leanest script - you’re trusted to understand subtext. The dialogue has an almost surgical precision to it. It also does things I’ve never seen before, in ways only video games can. It is a generation-defining masterpiece.There’s a structural pattern that’s similar to other Naughty Dog games, of course. You see a landmark, you head towards it, and you have pockets of adventure along the way. There are hub-style areas where you can explore optional buildings around Seattle, but the majority of the game is linear - tailored maps with multiple routes through ruined buildings, via underground train stations, and lush, overgrown parks. There’s surprising variety to the places you visit, though, and a strong sense of discovery, awe, and exploration, despite that linearity.There are tense stealth sections, huge battles, blood-curdling horror scenes, exciting chase sequences, three-way conflicts, moments of quiet exploration, and even environmental puzzles that aren’t just based on carrying ladders around.It builds slowly - it is hours before you fight any humans - with relationships and character growth at the fore. You pick through buildings and see the ghost of a world that’s alien to these young survivors, scavenging for supplies, ignoring the whiteboards filled with pitch-meeting notes and profit forecasts. It earns its action and that lends it more impact as a result.Things ramp up in intensity as the story goes on, but it’s interspersed with those aforementioned flashbacks. These give you room to breathe when the main story is going full throttle. In one, you explore a museum with Joel and Ellie. There’s no combat, just two characters bonding as you interact with props. It’s one of my favourite sequences in a game ever, and lands harder than any virtual bullet.It’s not something I expected going in, but The Last of Us Part 2 reminds me of Metal Gear Solid 5 mechanically. You spend much of the game laid prone in the grass, slithering between patrol routes. You cut through and around buildings, slip through small gaps, and hide under trucks and trains. It’s stealth that’s designed to keep you moving, to keep you reacting and improvising, to keep you clenching your jaw - and not just because you don’t want a bloater to rip it off.Level design is Naughty Dog’s best, each encounter offering multiple routes and opportunities for stealth, action, and a blend of the two. You’re constantly segueing in and out of stealth as you pick off enemies with guerrilla tactics. It makes you feel like a deadly hunter one minute and timid prey the next. The AI coordinates, using vantage points and pincer tactics, flanking and flushing out: they pull you by a leg as you hide underneath a truck; they sweep buildings like a SWAT team. It’s more dynamic than the original - unpredictable and exciting.In one scene, the two main enemy factions are fighting, one side standing in the flooded streets and the other in a ruined building overlooking the open space. I park my boat and crawl, fully submerged, through the knee-high water. The Seraphites, a group of religious fanatics who communicate via whistles (which are somehow more unnerving than the echo-location clicks from an infected) are winning. They’re raining down molotov cocktails on the WLF (or Wolves) below. Covered by the screams, I crawl onto a waterlogged bank, pull out my rifle, and take aim at a Seraphite through my scope. I pull the trigger and skull fragments explode from the back of his head, alerting the others.As I continue picking them off, I’m distracted by nearby splashing so I pull my eye from the scope to see two of them swimming at me, one from each side. I switch to my shotgun and take one of their heads off, using the last remaining shell to rip the leg from my other attacker. From the building, I hear their allies screaming their names.When I first played The Last of Us Part 2, I misunderstood the intent behind this. Every single human in this game has a name, and soldiers call out for their fallen friends and use names in idle chatter. I thought this was to make you feel guilty for shoving a switchblade into their neck, but it’s not just that.Naughty Dog names the enemies in The Last of Us Part 2 as a thematic choice. This is a story of revenge, and names remind you that these aren’t faceless drones: each person you kill could leave behind a loved one who might want payback. Good and evil is a matter of perspective in a lawless world where people act on survival instinct. It’s holistic - gameplay and story in harmony. Even a minigame where you pluck at the strings of a fully functional guitar serves a purpose in the larger tale.Every mechanic and story beat reinforces the themes. Combat is scrappy and messy. Incoming shots sometimes knock you onto your back where you’re free to return fire in a desperate effort. In one scene, Ellie kills someone who’s playing Hotline Miami on a PS Vita. She looks so ordinary, but she attacks you. It’s self defense. The next minute she’s bleeding out on the floor as the music from her portable console rings out. It’s fitting, because the aftermath of each battle reminded me of Dennaton Games’ indie hit.Hotline Miami features a repeating cycle of top-down violence punctuated by a slow walk back through that carnage, over bodies and through corridors painted in blood. It wordlessly asks you to reflect on your violent deeds.Here that same feeling translates to a 3D, photorealistic scene. Bodies lay limp with jaws ripped from their face, teeth missing, blood spilling from the exit wound. Shoot someone with an explosive arrow indoors and a chunk of flesh might stick to the ceiling and drip down in the aftermath - a thick splash of liquid and unidentifiable body parts where a human once stood. Shoot someone in the throat and they die with a gargle, bleeding out and twitching as blood pools around them. It’s horrific, but it all works together to create a mood of unease.The brilliant acting makes everything land harder. When the characters cry out, you feel it. When they say one thing and mean another, you get it. Every little facial tic, every shaking hand - Ashley Johnson, Laura Bailey, Ian Alexander, and Shannon Woodward all put in the performances of a lifetime, but even most of the side characters leave a lasting impression.When the credits rolled on The Last of Us Part 2 I was still buzzing from the excitement of the final few hours. My loyalty shifted between characters. I grew to love who I hated and dislike who I loved. I laughed, I teared up. I felt anger and elation. It’s the new high water mark for video game characters and I can’t wait for everyone to see just how special it is. As soon as it ended, I booted up New Game Plus and I’m experiencing it again with my eyes open, the context of the finished story imprinting new meaning into those early scenes and characters. I’m not swiping in the dark anymore.Version tested: PS4 Pro - a review copy was provided by Sony. You're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!

The Last of Us Part II,Kyle Hanson,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/the-last-of-us-part-ii-review/,"Naughty Dog’s The Last of Us isn’t just one of the best games of its generation, it is arguably one of the best games of all time. Featuring stellar performances, tight stealth-action gameplay, and a truly compelling, emotional story, the game was a milestone for its medium. But could a sequel capture that same magic? Apparently so, as The Last of Us Part II serves as a truly exceptional followup, expanding on the story and world while also reshaping much of that first game in a fascinating new light. Once again Naughty Dog has crafted one of the best games ever made, though the plot will challenge players in many unexpected ways.The Last of Us Part II picks up about five years after the shocking ending of the first game. Ellie and Joel have been living in Jackson, forming a large community amidst the chaos of the fungal-zombie apocalypse. The Last of Us was a somewhat story heavy offering, especially for its genre, and Part II expands this with even more plot and story content. However, while the story is key to your enjoyment of the game, avoiding spoilers is even more important. Given this, I’m going to avoid sharing any plot details, as the game is a far better experience the less you know going in.What you do need to know is that The Last of Us Part II expands, enhances, and builds on the story of the first game. You might not need to have played it to get everything, but it will help quite a bit. Likewise, it’s important to know that Part II puts more emphasis on the story, which means longer cutscenes and segments that don’t really feature much gameplay. If you are at all interested in the plot then this isn’t a problem. But make sure you don’t go in expecting an adrenaline-fueled, happy-go-lucky romp here. This is vicious stuff and you might find it takes some uncomfortable turns, but if you can handle the ride it’s all worth it.From start to finish, The Last of Us Part II delivers some of the finest writing, acting, and directing of any game ever made. It has the feeling of a long novel or the very best TV shows of the current golden age. Which is all the more impressive for a sequel to an already near-perfect story. It accomplishes this by avoiding the obvious. Part II doesn’t redo the first game, it comments on it and adds to it while showing, once again, that games can tell stories that challenge players and their conceptions of the world around them. The story will confront you in many ways as it features brutal presentations of an increasingly cruel world. While you may be frustrated with the direction some characters take, the game has something important to say and it says it exceptionally well.The Last of Us Part II delivers some of the finest writing, acting, and directing of any game ever madeSo if you’re coming to The Last of Us Part II for a continuation of the plot from the first game, you are in for one of the best gaming experiences in years. But beyond that, the gameplay takes a similar track, taking what worked in the first game and improving it immensely in a number of ways. Naughty Dog has cemented themselves as one of the finest third-person action developers around thanks to The Last of Us and Uncharted series. With The Last of Us Part II they have taken all of that experience and created an exceptional stealth-action experience once again.Areas are far larger and more open than they have been before, with some sections of the game almost feeling truly open world. It’s not totally open though and accidentally exiting an area can happen at times, possibly locking collectibles away for the rest of the game. It can also lead to some confusion as to where you need to go, especially when the boundaries of the world aren’t all that clear. Simple things like bushes or overgrowth can delineate a border, while not being entirely apparent to the player. But these momentary lapses in clarity are worth the tradeoff of a more vibrant and rich world to explore.This is still a fairly linear experience, keeping you moving toward your current objective, while placing numerous enemies of different types in your way. The infected are ever-present, popping up at the most inopportune of times, but handling them is simple once you know how to move and take them out. Series veterans will feel a sense of familiarity here, despite a few new additions to the infected roster. The increased frequency of Stalkers was a good choice, as they add variety to infected encounters more than any other change. However, it’s the humans that will really get your anxiety levels spiking as The Last of Us Part II features exceptional AI that creates an immersive and challenging experience with every encounter.Human enemies strategize and communicate at impressively realistic levels, even calling each other by name and reacting when someone is killed, even if they forget quickly on lower difficulty levels. Their tactics will vary based on which of the many difficulty options you pick, but even on Normal you’ll find a challenge ahead of you. Stealth is key, but with so much space for yourself and the enemies to hide in, keeping track of everything can be gleefully stress inducing. Entering an area full of enemies, assessing the danger depending on the factions or types, planning out your movement only to improvise as the well-laid plan falls apart is always tense and exhilarating. And you have so many tools at your disposal to handle it that you’ll find the most joy in just exploring your options.Your movement and tactical options are nearly infinite, with Ellie feeling like a capable combatant, but also a nimble assassin, depending on what’s called for in the situation. And that situation can change at any moment as you begin each segment in stealth which can either carry you to the exit or end rather quickly. This is especially true when dogs show up, as they can follow your scent, requiring you to distract them and their handler to avoid combat. You always want to avoid straight fights, since you’re outnumbered and often outgunned, but you do have tools to handle things once they get hectic.Ellie is more capable herself, especially once you unlock a majority of the expansive upgrade tree, but her arsenal has also grown. There’s the tried-and-true classics, along with new craftable items like silencers and different types of explosives. You gain new weapons that have a particular use, allowing you to tailor your loadout for the given situation. If you’re more stealthy, you can swap to the bow and silenced pistol while the rest of your arsenal is a few button taps away thanks to the returning quick access menu. Once things do fall apart, which they often will, the action feels just as seamless and smooth, just a lot more hectic.The Last of Us Part II excels at its gameplay just as much as it does in the story department. And the world in which you experience all of this is equally impressive. Naughty Dog knows how to make great looking games, and this may be their best yet. Everything from foliage to the dilapidated buildings that it has grown over looks amazing. You will often find yourself stopping to marvel at some new vista or just how realistic the environment looks. And as the game takes you to new and varied locales the quality never lets up.The Last of Us Part II is a truly worthy sequel to one of the greatest games ever made. Naughty Dog isn’t playing it safe in any area of the experience, with a bold and challenging story layered atop perfectly crafted stealth-action gameplay. Some players may not like where the story or its characters go, but for those that are ready for it, it will have you feeling joy, sorrow, grief, and anger to degrees few games have before. And in between all these hard moments is some of the smoothest and most well-designed third-person gameplay around. Naughty Dog has delivered another once-in-a-generation experience and it’s a must play for anyone with a PS4.
Attack of the Fanboy / GAME REVIEWS / The Last of Us Part II Review"
The Last of Us Part II,Adam Cook,God is a Geek,https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/the-last-of-us-part-ii-review/,"June 19, 2020.The Last of Us Part II is dark.And I don’t mean dark like you are expecting it to be. I can honestly say I’ve never seen some of the things in The Last of Us Part II in a game before. In fact, I’m not sure I’ve seen some of them anywhere. The brutality, desperation, and darkness of the human soul is borne out for all to see in pixel perfect format, and in absolute truth, it is going to be too much for some to take. I won’t spoil the story, but I will say I’ve never felt so conflicted over something a game has shown me, or asked me to do. I was pressing buttons and not wanting to press buttons, and there are multiple moments that left me desperate, begging for anything but that to happen… but it does. Because it’s Naughty Dog, and it’s The Last of Us, and it’s bleak, unforgiving, and yes, dark.What Naughty Dog has achieved here is revolutionary. Like all sequels, it betters itself from a gameplay standpoint, but unlike many, it takes risks – ones that mostly (but crucially, not entirely) pay off. The Last of Us Part II reminded me that a medium like games isn’t constrained by a “real” camera, and can go anywhere and show anything, this game proves we can do anything in a game, we’re not limited by anything other than imagination.But it is a game, though. So combat has improved, though if you couldn’t stand it before, I don’t think it’ll change your mind completely. Everything feels weighty and like it has a realistic, punchy feel to it. Your options are plentiful, and it may be my memory, but there feels like more guns, more tools, and more upgrades than ever before. Stealth feels like a genuine option, and there are moments where you can bypass entire combat scenarios by being quiet and sneaking through.When you do get your guns out, though, it feels superb. The shotgun has more beef behind it than a butcher’s back entrance. I could never decide which handgun I preferred: the slower, one-shot fan’s choice, or a silenced pistol that let me pop heads off “bad guys” or infected. Ranged combat is an option, as you can upgrade your tools at a workbench just like in the first game, to add a scope, improve stability; reload time, etc. It feels great, and every option feels viable.Take one section for example, where I was on the run from human enemies and found myself in the ruins of a tunnel housing multiple crashed trains. The foreboding darkness festooned with dust particles that are as beautiful as they are distracting, is broken by the torchlight of incoming soldiers and I’m wondering how I’ll get Ellie out of this in one piece. Then a sound in my right ear piece makes me feel ten times worse: there’s a Clicker down here. Hiding in the front carriage of a train the idea dawns on me that I can throw a bottle towards the soldiers and the Clickers might do the heavy lifting for me. It’s not the most highbrow concept a game has ever had; to pit your foes against one another, but that it worked so beautifully was a genuine wow moment. The numbers thinned, I stealthed my way round, shanking infected and human with glorious abandon, the dust lifting as I breached back to the surface world and Seattle’s lush, overgrown foliage a welcome sight indeed.Games have, for the longest time, struggled to get eyes right, but The Last of Us Part II nails it and then some. I’ve never seen emotion detailed so richly in a game, just by the welling up of eyes and the quivering of a lip. The rage in Ellie’s eyes is, at times, palpable. Her hatred is felt in your cold sweating hands as you push buttons. There’s one scene that even made me question whether I wanted to go on. “Push Square to swing the bat”. I pushed it, and again, and again. I wanted them to feel Ellie’s pain.The visuals, then, are mind blowing. Richly detailed shops and buildings make for a livable, but importantly, believable rendition of Seattle that is now just destroyed beauty. Puzzles that require searching the environment add to the feel that this place doesn’t exist because you’re travelling through it. Indeed, there are sections similar to Uncharted 4 that have mini-hubs within the world, offering a map you can explore and check off as you do so. In fact, The Last of Us Part II feels akin to Uncharted 4 and Lost Legacy mixed into one gigantic package. Sure it’s high budget in terms of how it looks, but you get the feeling it matters to Naughty Dog that their world feels real.Special mention to the audio team, as well. I’ve long said that audio in games is a underappreciated medium, but across the board, from the voice acting to the music, to the sound effect, to the incidental moments you won’t remember in ten years, but that make everything just that little bit more atmospheric and real-feeling: it’s spellbinding to play with a pair of headphones on. In fact, so good is the audio that one moment made me jump more than any game has ever done before, and it was all down to the sound. The Clickers are ferocious sounding; terrifying, even, and some of the new enemies use sound to such enormous effect that the fear is delivered via the ears, not the eyes. Oh and as for that soundtrack? Well, it’s better than first. There; I said it.It’s very clear from the offset that there are multiple stories the developer wanted to tell here, multiple characters who all have lives and emotions, drives and desires. But in telling such a large story (the game is over 25 hours long) the team slightly overstretched themselves. I won’t spoil it here, and thus can’t explain truly why, but there are consequences to actions that feel like they aren’t quite paid off. For the record, I completely understand why certain decisions were made, but after playing through an adventure that tested my resolve; my own will to push through the darkness, as the final credits rolled I just felt ever so slightly that the conclusion of the story was a bit of a cop out, and that maybe the team weren’t quite sure how to actually end the journey.There are things here that will leave you stunned. You will put the controller down and wonder “can they do this in a game?”, and then when you’ve gotten over that, Naughty Dog will up the ante again, and again, and again. You will see things and go places that you never thought a game would go. It will bend you to its will and change your feelings as you play. You will feel anger, sadness, elation, fear, and everything a truly magnificent piece of art should elicit from you. Make no mistake, The Last of Us Part II is art, and despite my misgivings about its conclusion and that it maybe, just maybe, outstays its welcome, it’s still an absolute masterpiece.Best in class audio and visuals

The Last of Us Part II,Dean Takahashi,GamesBeat,https://venturebeat.com/2020/06/12/the-last-of-us-part-ii-review-a-brilliant-game-that-is-not-what-it-seems/,"Connect with top gaming leaders in Los Angeles at GamesBeat Summit 2023 this May 22-23. Register here.At last, the long-awaited sequel from Naughty Dog is here. The Last of Us Part II debuts June 19 for the PlayStation 4, but I’ve played through the game a couple of times for this review. And I am glad to say I am not disappointed with the risks the developer took, even though the game didn’t go where I thought it would go, nor where I wanted it to go.Early on, the previews gave us clues that a tragic event that would trigger the journey of the second game. There is no question that playing the game is an intense emotional and moving experience. But the story had some twists that I believe will prove controversial and perhaps unpopular among enthusiastic fans.I’m glad to see some risk-taking. The stakes couldn’t be higher. With more than 100 million PS4s sold, Sony has a chance to sell tens of millions of copies of this game (as of 2018, The Last of Us sold 17 million copies). The original won numerous Game of the Year awards, and it’s my favorite game of all time.Early on, I detested parts of the story. But Naughty Dog committed itself to this unpopular direction. Despite my initial misgivings, I’m glad they went down this road, because it made me question my sense of right and wrong.GamesBeat Summit 2023Join the GamesBeat community in Los Angeles this May 22-23. You’ll hear from the brightest minds within the gaming industry to share their updates on the latest developments.It’s so eerie to play the game about a post-pandemic zombie apocalypse during a pandemic, with sirens for emergency vehicles going off in the background in real life. If there was a solace, I played this one together with my middle daughter, who was too young to play such a serious game when the first one debuted.But I was so much happier in the sadness of the world of The Last of Us Part II, and I was so disappointed to snap out of it after each play session and emerge in today’s reality. We have waited for this game for a long time, with multiple delays. But the good thing about those delays is that I did not encounter any showstopper bugs in the game on my PS4 Pro. That is exceedingly rare.Naughty Dog vice president Neil Druckmann (who directed The Last of Us Part II) and the company’s own trailers have spoiled a lot of the story. But you shouldn’t place stock in everything that they have led you to believe. Part II is not at all what it seems. In fact, Naughty Dog has gone out of its way to mislead us into thinking what the game is about.A story told in a compelling wayI’ve already begun to sound like I want to rewrite Naughty Dog’s script. But let’s be clear. I believe that nobody tells better stories than Naughty Dog. This story is told in a series of flashbacks and flash-forwards in a timeline. You’ll see the characters get put into an excruciating situation, and then you’ll have to wait, as the story moves back in time to a flashback that will explain how you got into that situation.This can be very frustrating until you learn the reason for the flashbacks, and that makes the dramatic impact so much bigger. I’d like to say so much more, but that would be spoiling the story.Flashbacks are an interesting tool for a storyteller because they give you a way to learn something about a character who is dead in its present but still alive in your memory.Above: The melancholy guitar makes many appearances in The Last of Us Part IIThe story of the first game came with a bookend ending that resonated for me. I was deeply touched by the story of the teenage girl Ellie and gruff smuggler Joel — two survivors of the zombie apocalypse who spend their days just trying to survive. The graphic violence is horrific, but more often than not, Joel does it in the name of protecting Ellie, and later on it’s Ellie protecting Joel. Fighting the zombies takes skill and stealth, and too often the human enemies are worse.At the beginning of The Last of Us, Joel loses his teenage daughter at the start of the pandemic. By the end of the game, he had to decide whether to save Ellie or watch his surrogate daughter die. He had to choose how much he was willing to sacrifice for somebody he loved. Joel made the choice of a parent, and it was easier to make that choice even though the fate of the world was at hand. What made his choice easier is that, throughout the entire game, we learned what a shitty place the world had become.When I finished the first game, I thought about a quote from Steven Spielberg’s film, Schindler’s List, about the German man who saved Jews during the Holocaust. It says, “Whoever saves one life saves the world entire.” That quote came to mind as I finished the game. Joel saved a life, and he said the world be damned.And now Joel has to live with that choice in Part II. The sequel is not about love, but hate. It is about what you would sacrifice to take revenge. Can you get justice and closure without sacrificing your soul? The main characters go on a long journey to discover something about themselves. This new game also has its bookend ending, and all I will say about that, for now, is that it involves a guitar.Amazing graphics affect gameplayThis is one of the prettiest games with it comes to graphics on the PS4. So many graphical marvels appeared in the imagery that I lost count. But these improvements in graphics aren’t just part of the scenery — they affect gameplay.Above: Seattle is overgrown and flooded in The Last of Us Part IIOn a skyscraper in the clouds, the fog gets in your way just as you’re trying to aim at an enemy. The grass blows in the wind, and it gives you a place to hide while you creep up on a foe. You can swim underwater, find key secrets at the bottom, and emerge in a place where the enemy doesn’t expect you.The story spans seasons and climates, such as the snows of Jackson, Wyoming or the lush jungle-like landscapes of an overgrown Seattle. The cities are authentic, with great attention to detail. You’ll find coffee shops in Seattle, but they’re overrun with vines, moss, and long grass growing out of cracks in the floors and walls.In Wyoming, Ellie loses track of another character, Dina, in a snowstorm and then finds her again. In that way, the environment plays a role in the gameplay as well as the story.A diversity of characters with different perspectivesWe’re used to video games that give us good guys and bad guys. In the previous game, our main characters were just Ellie, then 14, and Joel, a grizzled old man in his 40s. In Part II, Ellie (played by Ashley Johnson) and Joel (Troy Baker) are four years older. But they’re joined by a big cast of characters in Jackson, Wyoming, like Jesse (Stephen Chang), Dina (Shannon Woodward), Tommy (Jeffrey Pierce), and others — as well as a number of strangers that we meet along the way.Above: Dina (left) is Ellie’s love in The Last of Us Part IIThis game goes out of its way to paint two sides to every person and to show them in shades of gray. Ellie and Joel are both brutal killers in the first game, and they remain so in the second game, though they have settled down in Jackson. Now their job is to protect their home from the Infected (as the zombies are called) and human foes outside the walls. Yes, even after a pandemic, more so than today, humanity has to live in a world that has walls, and those walls have to be guarded by people like Ellie and Joel.While the first game doesn’t have much by way of supporting characters, the sequel’s cast gives us a contrasting point of view to the people we have come to love. They are different kinds of survivors, and they highlight how people can make some contrasting choices in this gray world.Significant gameplay improvementsPart II has some huge technological improvements. In close combat and in exploration, Ellie can do so much more thanks to these changes. And it makes the fighting intense, grueling, and raw in a way that, if you can believe it, doesn’t happen in the first game.Above: Ellie pits Infected against human foes in The Last of Us Part II.She can swing on ropes, climb vertical structures to avoid trouble, navigate boats, ride horses, break glass, and crawl through grass. She faces enemies such as dogs who can trace her footsteps, stealth warriors who can attack with arrows, and large numbers of zombies. Ellie can sprint, dodge attacks, and time her counterattacks. She can use enemies as a shield, and she can get help from her friends. This makes combat far more diverse than in The Last of Us.And as she does in the first game, Ellie can pit enemies against each other, making zombies attack humans. All of these improvements ratchet up the level of skill.Occasional humorOne character makes a keen observation about how two others are behaving awkwardly when together. It just so happens that one of the characters, who is afraid of heights, is trying to deal with a high crossing. The character replies, “Now?” As in, you have to ask me that now? It’s pretty comic, trust me. And after a particularly difficult level, one of the characters screams, “Fuck Seattle!”Calling all gaming execs!

Create Account Back in 2013, The Last of Us floored gamers with its tale of a grieving father working to smuggle a young woman across a post-civilization America teeming with human monsters infected with a fungal disease. It was a story of redemption, an examination of the human need for connection and family, and, in the end, an exploration of what we will do to protect the ones we love, both physically and mentally. It was a terrifying and emotionally devastating masterpiece of interactive entertainment that elevated the medium as a platform for dramatic and intimately human storytelling.Fast-forward seven years and writer/director Neil Drukmann — along with plenty of collaborators at Naughty Dog — has revisited this plague-ravaged world in The Last of Us Part II.Sign up to receive the daily top stories from the Financial Post, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.A welcome email is on its way.

Please try again The new game picks up where the original game left off, with Joel and Ellie attempting to settle into a peaceful village of survivors in Jackson, Wyoming. But while the pair’s relationship has grown and matured, there’s a tension, too. Ellie knows Joel is keeping something from her.That something is, of course, what happened at the end of the first game. The reason the duo had been travelling across the country was because Ellie had proven herself immune to the fungal infection. There were doctors in the west who could potentially create a cure from her biology, and Joel needed to get her there. But when the scientists finally got a look at Ellie, they discovered that researching a cure would kill her. Joel discovered this, and — mentally unable to lose another daughter-like figure in his life — murdered all the doctors while Ellie was unconscious. He never told her what he did. She woke up in the backseat of a car, still wearing her hospital gown.That’s all you need to know heading into the second game. And I’m not going to say much more about the plot here. I managed the unlikely feat of sheltering myself from pretty much all of the game’s promotional material leading up to its launch, which meant every one of the many plot twists and heartbreaking character revelations that came during my epic 38-hour first play-through (yes, I’ve already started a second) elicited the shock that was intended. This is an experience worth preserving for anyone taking the time to read this review.What I can safely say, however, is that the sequel packs an emotional wallop just as powerful as that of the original. But whereas the first game was about how a lost young woman and broken middle-aged man found family in each other, the sequel has a darker tone. It is about thirst for revenge. Through parallel stories we see how love and loss combine to create a toxic stew that can’t help but lead to further tragedy. An eye for an eye, inevitably, makes the whole world blind — unless someone chooses to stop the cycle.The result is a game that is at times unexpectedly and horrifically violent. The look of anger and desperation on protagonists’ faces as they fight enemies both human and monster is haunting. And when the camera is close enough you can actually see the life leave the eyes of the people they kill as they suffocate, their necks are snapped, or a shiv is jabbed into their carotid artery.What’s fascinating, though, is that The Last of Us Part II is in fact a sharp statement against violence. There are times when you absolutely will not want to touch the attack button, even though you feel like you must, that justice, loyalty, and love somehow demand it. It is an affecting reflection of the world and times in which we live. The question is whether the game’s heroes will be able to see this tragic flaw within themselves before it’s too late.There are plenty of additional themes at play beyond vengeance and forgiveness. The Last of Us Part II boldly — yet subtly and naturally — champions progressive causes. Not just same-sex relationships, which the series originally tackled in the excellent The Last of Us: Left Behind DLC released for the original game, but also the timely topics of fascism, racism, and gender identity. These aren’t exactly the sort of subjects the medium of interactive entertainment is generally known to take on, but Naughty Dog approaches them with thoughtfulness and grace. Suffice to say this is a game interested in communicating ideas, rousing our emotions, and making people consider (or even reconsider) their beliefs.Clearly, there’s some serious narrative heavy lifting going on, and it’s done on the backs not just of the writers, but also an outstanding cast of voice and performance capture actors led by Ashley Johnson and Troy Baker, who reprise their roles as Ellie and Joel, respectively, and veteran video game voicer Laura Bailey, who bravely steps into the challenging role of series newcomer Abby (you’ll need to play to learn more about her).Just as important to the story is the game’s world. The Last of Us Part II provides an unparalleled virtual rendering of a post-civilization landscape brought to ruin by both monsters and men that is swiftly being reclaimed by nature in all her glory, including abundant wildlife and verdant vegetation.Equal parts eerie and beautiful, it feels as though every centimetre of the environments we explore has been crafted with purpose. The ruined homes, apartments, stores, and offices we walk through aren’t just loot caches to be raided for crafting resources and ammunition, but miniature stories that we can discover by putting together the pieces of what happened years ago through the hastily scrawled notes, human remains, and dusty artifacts that we find. Even the soundscape — dripping water, flapping bird wings, a brilliantly minimalistic acoustic score — plays a key role in setting tone and establishing milieu.So engrossing and rewarding is the act of exploration that its interruption by action and combat would almost be unwelcome if it, too, weren’t so compelling. And by compelling I mean tense and terrifying.Much like the original game, encounters come in two types: infected and humans. Fighting the infected is a rush. One wrong move and you’re dead. Ellie might be immune to spores, but even she can’t survive a mushroom head ripping out her throat. That means employing stealth and strategy based on the type of creature you’re facing. Some are blind but fast. Others are slow but hard to kill. All are lethal. Keeping quiet, setting traps, and listening for movement are vital tactics that grow and evolve as our protagonists learn to craft new types of items and ammunition.Humans, on the other hand, require different strategies. They tend to appear in larger numbers, have weapons they can use from a distance, and are smarter, communicating with each other and employing flanking manoeuvres. And then there’s morality to consider. Do you really need to kill them? These people with friends and families of their own, who use each other’s names, talk about mundane things, and express sorrow and anger when they discover you’ve killed one of their comrades or dogs? Sometimes it’s your call.Which brings us full circle. The Last of Us Part II manages the none-too-easy feat of imbuing video game violence with meaning. Its combat is thrilling and darkly addictive, but this is a story about how violence changes people and rarely solves anything. The consequences of killing are made abundantly clear over and over again until, by the end, I simply no longer wanted to fight. I wanted to put down the controller as though it was a gun for which I no longer had any desire to use.That’s a neat trick, Naughty Dog. And one hell of an encore.

The Last of Us Part II,Ron Burke,GamingTrend,https://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/you-have-no-idea-what-loss-is-the-last-of-us-part-ii-review/,"The Last of Us II is a cinematic masterpiece, filled with some of the best writing of any medium, so I want to be as respectful as I can to anyone not wanting that spoiled for them. To that end, this review will be the lightest of touches on anything story related, aiming to preserve the experience. That said, some parts of the ending of the first game are mentioned, so please tread carefully if you’ve not finished that quite yet. Enjoy!It’s been five years since the events of The Last of Us. Ellie (now 19 years old) and Joel have found some measure of peace, living in a tight knit community of survivors including Joel’s brother Tommy. Hunting infected has become part of the routine — normal, if that’s a thing in a world shattered by disease. The thing about normal is that it rarely stays that way. The different types of infected are well known, as are their weaknesses. So much so that patrol groups routinely hunt them down and kill them on a regular basis. But it’s never really the obvious threats that endanger humanity — it’s humanity itself.The Last of Us and its sequel are both games of scarcity. Food, fresh water, weapons, ammunition — everything is in short supply, but nothing more so than compassion and humanity. As a deeper realization that this world is not getting better sets in, those who have the means to band together look to take by force from those who have chosen instead to try to peacefully survive. When this threat touches Ellie’s community directly, our adventure begins. As I mentioned before, I’m not going to focus on the storyline as that would ruin the experience. Instead I’ll focus on the broad strokes of this 30+ hour experience.While much of the game does take place in Seattle, that’s not the only place you’ll be visiting. Taking a page from Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End, there are now open world areas that let you reach out and explore with little more than a map and a general idea of where you need to go to push the story forward. If that worries you as open environments tend to mean “bring your own fun” nonsense, rest assured that Naughty Dog has balanced these parts perfectly. It’s open enough to stretch your legs, but the game is quick to remind you that the world is far from empty with story beats that pop up without warning.The parts that are linear are fully masked by the side missions to find things like collectable trading cards and the always-present hunt for supplies. You’ll also find story snippets such as a woman who has barricaded herself in a conference center while her husband goes out and tries to find meds for her. Unfortunately, a thorough exploration of the area will also turn up the remains of her husband who didn’t quite make it back. Finding these connected moments bring the story to life, even if the participants in said story have succumbed to the horrors of the world around them, and their last moments are conveyed with hand written notes and touching goodbyes.One element of The Last of Us that gets polished to perfection in this sequel is the ever present tension. Combined with a stellar soundtrack, the tension ebbs and flows to the point where it becomes anxiety-inducing. You’ll feel the sense of paranoia build as you’ve had too long of a stretch of quiet. There is always a sinking feeling that the entire world is ready to blow up at your feet, and you see that reflected in Ellie’s interactions with those around her.A few elements of the first game have been retooled. Previously, you had a handful of skills you could upgrade for Joel, including crafting and healing speed, listening mode distance, health, and weapon sway. Naughty Dog has amped that to 11 with The Last of Us Part II, giving Ellie just a handful of similar skills to start with, but growing that to five separate categories as you find training manuals in the world. These open up skill trees underneath survival, crafting, precision, stealth, and explosives. These grant far more flexibility in your gameplay choices than before, offering upgrades to health, longer lasting gun suppressors, or better bow handling, just to name a few.Similar to the improvements to the skill system, the weapon bench sees an upgrade. Now, we see Ellie physically attach scopes, range finders, and other items to the weapons, as well as taking a rasp to the grip to improve the palm weld. Beyond the visuals, these also play into the “play your way” approach, though there hardly seems to be enough spare parts in the world to upgrade everything — choose wisely.Friends and family are a big part of The Last of Us Part II.Beyond the skills and weapons, there are a few new traversal mechanics that help Ellie tackle the world. Again, straight from Uncharted 4, we see the use of rope mechanics. You’ll use them to climb, swing, and solve a few puzzles. That’s great, but the moment that Ellie jumped in the water and didn’t drown was a cause of genuine celebration. Gone are the pallet dragging puzzles from the first game — Ellie can handle the water just fine. You’ll also have a few travel options including a horse for some sections, and even a boat for a few flooded areas.The Last of Us has always been about stealth, but there is a greater emphasis here. The first title was about staying out of sight, but now there are a few new elements to raise the tension a bit. Ellie can hide in long grass or in overgrown brush. She can also go prone and climb underneath vehicles and lay under structures. Laying underneath the forest floor undergrowth will raise the hair on the back of your neck as enemies damned near step on you as they walk by with the sound roaring in your ears indicating that you are close to being spotted. Worse still, they’ll now bring dogs to sniff you out. Ellie leaves a scent trail (which you can see with the listen mode, making it more of a “sense” mode), and the dogs can catch on to that. You can distract them and their handlers with a well-thrown bottle, but that won’t deter them for long. These dogs will force you out of position, ensuring you don’t just hang back and wait for opportunity. When you face dogs, everything gets a lot more difficult.Combat is a bit different in The Last of Us Part II. Where Joel was able to rely on his strength, Ellie has to use her agility. As a result, melee is more kinetic and relies on dodging and counterattacks. You’ll need these skills to face off against some of the new types of infected, as well as the two new factions in the game. I won’t ruin these other than to say that the sneaky Stalkers can all die in the largest bonfire you can possibly make. I don’t know which designer at Naughty Dog came up with them, but good job, you magnificent bastard.Overgrown grass is the key to stealth. Learn it, love it.One of the ways that Naughty Dog has brought this world to life is a staggering attention to detail. At one point you end up in a museum that has a planetarium. You might spin the planets and say “that’s neat” and move on, or you might notice that Venus doesn’t seem to rotate. That’s because a full “day” on Venus is a whopping 243 days (instead of just 24 hours here on Earth). Similarly, Ellie ejects a round from her firearms for safety before working on them, she fingers the correct frets on her guitar as you strum the touchpad, and she covers her face before she smashes a car window.The Last of Us Part II has a target frame rate of 30fps on the PlayStation 4 Pro, running at a crisp 4K with full HDR (though it would have been nice to see a “performance” option like we did in God of War). Not once, no matter how chaotic the scene got or how many high-poly assets were on screen, did I see a single frame rate wobble or hitch. Additionally, I never saw any hiccups or stutters as the game loaded. In fact, my only real technical note I have is that I did see (albeit extraordinarily rare) the odd level of detail mipmapping pop on a particular asset. It’s so rare that it’s hardly worth mentioning, and going back I couldn’t replicate it in the places I originally saw it. Knowing that assets are streaming off of a mechanical drive and that Naughty Dog has somehow managed to camouflage those limitations is absolutely astounding. I can only imagine what they’ll do with an SSD in the PlayStation 5, but I can say that we’ve not seen environments this richly detailed.While I thankfully only need the subtitles due to my own hearing damage, The Last of Us II has the most extensive accessibility options I’ve ever seen in any game, on any platform. There’s even a text-to-speech option! Adding backgrounds to subtitles, directional indications to identify who is speaking, color blind choices — there are pages upon pages of choices to tune the experience for any need. I racked my brain trying to think of anything else they could have put in and I came up dry. It’s rare to see this level of effort in this area, but it’s incredibly appreciated.I want to acknowledge again just how fantastic the storyline is in this game. Neil Druckman teamed up with Halley Wegryn Gross of Westworld fame to bring this world to life for the sequel, and it shows. This violent world has a sinister undertow, punctuated by quiet moments that still somehow run a current of tension through it as you wait for the other shoe to drop. It’s in these quiet moments that The Last of Us II shines brightest. The character interactions are genuine and real, the people involved are fallible and deep. This dead world riddled with danger and disease is alive with the duality of nature — as cruel and unflinching as it is inevitable. The protagonists have settled into this new normal which only amplifies the danger all around them, but in it they try to steal away real moments to make it all worthwhile. Genuine affection, the struggles of a new relationship, the heartbreak of loss — these things make us human, they exist in the story beats between the chaos, and they do so honestly. It’s rare that games nail the storyline this perfectly, but The Last of Us Part II is, in a word, perfect.The Last of Us Part II is a stunningly beautiful and impeccably written story of family, consequences, horror, and loss. It pulls you in and holds tight, forging a deeper connection with Ellie, her fellow survivors, and the hostile world in which they live.

The Last of Us Part II,Keza MacDonald,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/jun/12/the-last-of-us-part-ii-review-zombie-fiction-playstation-4-naughty-dog-sony,"PlayStation 4; Naughty Dog/SonyThis intense game set in a post-disaster world poses moral questions about the motivations for violence and is brilliantly acted by its human contributors. (Spoiler free)‘Before you embark on a journey of revenge, dig two graves.” So goes the saying popularly (if spuriously) attributed to Confucius – a proverbial truth that The Last of Us Part II explores, unflinchingly and sometimes gruesomely, for 30 hours. It is difficult to explain how exactly it does this without robbing players of the chance to experience it for themselves, but I will say this: no video game has ever gone to these lengths to humanise the enemy, or to interrogate the violence that it asks the player to perform.We play as Ellie, a 19-year-old born a few years after a fungal illness devastated human civilisation, turning the afflicted into shambling, deformed husks and the world’s cities into overgrown relics. Since the events of The Last of Us (2013), she has been living in a stable community of survivors, making friends, learning the guitar, kissing girls at dances. But a traumatic event drives her to leave the relative safety of Jackson on a revenge mission that takes her to the remains of Seattle.The city has been ravaged first by the military, then by the infected, and finally by nature. Vegetation grows through the cars rooted to the highway and rusting skyscrapers preside over ominously empty streets. Abandoned storefronts and apartment buildings might hide notes from doomed former residents, scrap with which to fix up Ellie’s weapons or craft improvised explosives and health kits – or dormant infected ready to tear her to bits. Before long, she comes into contact with the remaining human residents of the city: the remnants of a well-equipped militia and the unsettling followers of a brutal cult, whistling creepily to each other as they hunt Ellie down.There is shooting and molotov cocktails, and even a flamethrower at one point, but there is also an awful lot of hiding, running away, and creeping through long grass, desperately hoping not to be found. This isn’t a game that makes you feel powerful. Ellie can take care of herself, but I spent much of this game feeling horribly imperilled. It is usually difficult but possible to sneak past undetected or run away from fights, but good luck finding the best paths through knots of soldiers or navigating a subway station full of zombies on your first try.More often, I was forced into desperate, scrabbling combat, trying not to get overwhelmed, wasting bullets in a panic. Very occasionally this felt slightly farcical; once I was stuck hiding on top of a shipping container, having exhausted all my ammo for every weapon, waiting for an opening to dash to the door I needed to get through to end the scene. But more often it feels intense and dramatic; immense relief descended on me every time I made it through a scene unscathed. This game pulls the occasional horror trick on you, sending you falling through a floor into a dark basement full of zombies or confronting you with horrendous Resident Evil-inspired new variants on the infected, but the scariest parts for me were when I was probing through seemingly empty buildings, or hiding in a corner praying that guard dogs wouldn’t sniff me out. The violence is extreme, sometimes uncomfortable, and consequential. It’s hard to feel too bad for shooting, bludgeoning or blowing up the grotesque and suffering infected as they run at you, gasping, moaning and making hideous clicking noises, but when Ellie is choking a struggling human enemy, grim-faced, it’s not pleasant to watch. In video games we are accustomed to an action-movie suspension of disbelief in relation to body counts, and to a straightforward moral assumption that the player characters whose perspective we inhabit are the goodies, and that the people on the other side of the aiming reticle are the baddies. The Last of Us Part II challenges both of these assumptions.This isn’t a straightforward violence-is-bad story. As in most zombie fiction, violence is baked into this world and our interactions with it. Instead, it’s about the motivations for that violence, the endless cycles of retribution that pull individuals or whole populations down into destructive spirals, and what it takes to break those cycles. There were parts of it that I had to endure rather than enjoy, furious or disgusted by what characters were doing – and, by extension, by what I was doing. There will be many players who don’t like where this story takes them, but by God, it’s emotionally effective. I was obsessed with it from the first hour, and now that I’ve finished it, I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it for days.This effectiveness is the result of some fine acting from The Last of Us Part II’s human stars, and the immense technical skill on show in translating those performances to the screen. Never for a moment did the awareness that I was watching 3D models interact with each other intrude on my experience of this story. You can see every scar, scratch and micro-expression on their faces, read their body language, hear the venom or fear or conflict in their voices – and these characters are, not incidentally, the most diverse set to feature in a game as big as this. It is rare in games for the moments when you’re not playing to be as memorable as those when you are.The writing is extremely good, not only the dialogue but also the masterful use of flashbacks and other narrative devices to flesh out personalities and motivations, having you revisit scenes and places in new contexts that make you see things differently. Chases, shootouts and horribly tense forays through long-abandoned, zombie-infested buildings are balanced with quiet (or quietly devastating) scenes where all you do is talk and look around. The game’s graphical and technical accomplishments are just as key to its power: everything from the animation to the scene-setting, every building and battered piece of furniture and tiny trinket that makes up this post-apocalyptic Americana, is meticulous and astounding.This is an unlikely comparison, but now that I’ve had some time to absorb The Last of Us Part II, it reminds me thematically of Shadow of the Colossus, another game about how consuming grief and anger can be. I was similarly poleaxed by that game’s clever manipulation of the player’s power, the way it also used the language of video games to make you think twice about your actions. The Last of Us Part II is another story that could only work as a game, the kind of challenging, groundbreaking work that comes along two or three times a decade.The Last of Us Part II is out on 19 June; £49.99."

			Sony's big budget PS4 exclusive might actually surpass the achievements of its illustrious predecessor
		Making a big budget, ultra-violent video game about the harmful consequences of violence is a bold move. It can be difficult to convey nuance and subtext when your photo realistic world is awash with the virtual entrails of vanquished enemies and your player character’s clothes have turned crimson with other people’s blood. In this respect, The Last of Us Part II doesn’t so much have its cake and eat it as smear the confection around its face and dare you to disapprove.If the 2013 original was, at heart, a story about unconditional parental love and the sacrifices we’re willing to make for our children then this equally powerful sequel looks at the reverse of the coin, hate, and asks the question: if vengeance is pursued at all costs, what happens to those who end up paying the price?It’s practically impossible to go into specifics without stumbling into spoiler territory and The Last of Us Part II is very much an experience enriched by entering with as little advance knowledge as possible. Suffice it to say that something very bad indeed happens to returning heroine Ellie at the outset, triggering a gripping 25-hour descent into the heart of darkness (or rain-lashed Seattle as it’s also known) which is every inch the equal of Conrad and Coppola’s work in their respective media. The crucial difference here, of course, is agency. The victims of Ellie’s murderous odyssey die by your hand as well as hers, and developers Naughty Dog employ an impressive suite of mechanics to ensure you, the player, is aware of the blood on your thumbsticks. These vary in size and scale, from rank and file enemies referring to each other by name to reinforce their humanity, up to some genuinely unsettling set piece stunts which recall similarly genre-defining moments from games like Bioshock and SpecOps: The Line. Where Naughty Dog themselves sometimes stumble is the sheer volume of viscera players are forced to endure. Combat in The Last of Us Part II is beyond brutal; it’s violent to the point of viciousness, and so graphic as to risk being gratuitous. Director Neil Druckmann will argue - and, indeed has - that this level of realism is necessary to drive home the consequences of the player’s actions, and also the game’s stealth mechanics make most of the murders optional anyway.The defence only holds so much water. The game’s camera occasionally lingers on the gore a little too lovingly, giving the impression of a voyeur rather than a documenter. And while the game’s stealth elements are much improved - this is by some distance Naughty Dog’s most impressive implementation of combat to date - the armies of enemies Ellie must pick her way through often makes bloodshed inevitable. Indeed, some of the encounters in the closing couple of hours feel more suited to the same studio's Uncharted series than this one. Combat is only half the story here, though, and The Last of Us Part II’s actual storytelling is exceptional, expanding on the narrative tricks and techniques explored in the first game and honed in its subsequent slice of sumptuous downloadable content, Left Behind. The most memorable moments of that add-on were arguably those in which nothing much actually happened at all, and similarly this sequel often shines brightest when it's most mundane: the times Ellie passes chit chatting with her companions while picking through the rubble of our ruined society; or the often delightful flashback sequences designed to flesh out the main cast’s characters and motivations rather than flay the flesh from their foes.Naughty Dog are masters of mood but for all the intensity they generate - and a significant chunk of Part II plays like a full-on horror title - one of the most memorable levels here is the initial introduction to downtown Seattle, a sprawling exploratory experience which owes much to the Madagascan open world experiments of  Uncharted 4. None of this would be believable - or even possible - without the world class world-building, animation and performances pulled together by what is now inarguably one of the industry’s elite tier development houses. Troubling allegations surfaced earlier this year about Naughty Dog’s demanding working practices but, whether healthy or not, that obsession with perfection permeates every pixel here. Just as The Last of Us served as a high watermark for the previous console generation, so its sequel does for this. In fact, Last of Us Part II might even surpass the achievements of its predecessor. For while it inevitably lacks that first game’s shock of the new, it instead trades on the player’s familiarity with its characters and their backstories to take them somewhere equally unexpected. And while it may lose its focus a little in the penultimate reels, Last of Us II eventually lands an emotional punch that will be felt long after the credits roll. "

Spoiler-free, kiddo.The Last of Us: Part 2 is finally here after seven years (and a few extra weeks) of waiting. Joel and Ellie's harrowing adventure on the PlayStation 3 had one of the most talked-about endings in gaming history and many thought the story would stop there.Last of Us 2 delves deeper into the dramatic climax of the first game, the way Joel's decision impacted him and his relationship with Ellie. The sequel's emotional resonance relies heavily on you having played the first game, and even if you have, it's probably worth refreshing yourself.Buy The Last of Us: Part 2 on PS4This time, we pick up with Joel and Ellie a few years after the events of the first game. Ellie is a sleeve-tattooed adult and they're both comfortably settled in Jackson County alongside Joel's brother Tommy, his wife Maria and a massive town of people. Life is pretty good with parties, regular supply runs and sensible missions to clear nearby infected.Ellie learns the guitar thanks to Joel, which you can play yourself during several moments by strumming the touchpad. Hopefully there'll be videos of more musical players picking out whole songs with this mechanic soon. Inevitably, things soon go bad after the opening hours of the game. If you're lucky enough to have avoided the recent leaks, there are some really effective surprises. We won't spoil them now, but even if you've been spoiled, there's still so much great stuff to experience.Overall, The Last of Us: Part 2 is a game about revenge and forgiveness, themes which permeate through the story arc of numerous characters. The enemies mourn the death of their comrades and dogs when you kill them, while warring gangs constantly look for reprisals. However, the real impact of death is best exemplified in the main story.This time, we meet Dina, Ellie's love interest who you'll remember her kissing in the E3 trailer, plus Jesse, Dina's ex-boyfriend who also lives in Jackson. But there's also significant stretches of the game where Ellie is alone. Some of the greatest moments from the first game were the witty back-and-forth between Ellie and Joel, from that cheesy joke book to interesting perspectives on being a teenager in a post-apocalyptic world – like why would you not eat food if you have it!?Buy The Last of Us: Part 2 on PS4Sadly, Ellie has grown quite gruff and serious, much like Joel, and her conversations with other characters don't punctuate the horror with quirky levity as the original did. You'll spend long stretches in silence, which can make the constant hunting for essential crafting items seem hollow and repetitive. Thankfully, the overall story is strong, if convoluted slightly by the various time jumps, but they do help deliver the biggest narrative payoffs. The finale isn't as powerful as the original, but this game definitely feels like a worthy companion to the first game and not a cash-grabbing sequel. This story feels like it completes the picture.Gameplay hasn't been overhauled massively from the first time around, but it has been honed across traversal, combat, crafting and upgrading skills.Ellie is very quick, she can sprint, climb walls and ropes, jump, swim (huzzah), and even lay prone or crawl while taking potshots at enemies, very similarly to Metal Gear Solid.The new dodging function also allows Ellie to swerve melee attacks from man and monster alike, although we didn't find ourselves needing to use it much, as it's often easier to kill enemies with a calculated headshot.Ellie's starting arsenal is very similar to Joel's; her hunting rifle returns, along with a pistol, revolver, a short pump-action shotgun and the biggest new addition, her hunting bow – a seemingly new essential weapon in modern gaming.There's some meatier weapons down the line, including a crossbow, flamethrower and silenced machine gun, but as with the first game, you get them so late – luckily, there's a New Game+ mode, where you can carry over all your upgrades.There are a few ways to approach combat in the game. If you're stealthy, you'll want to dispatch enemies with arrows, your pistol (if you craft a degradable silencer) or take down enemies by hand with your unbreakable knife – yep, not more crafting shivs for Ellie this time around.The bow is ideal for silently dispatching enemies, but crafting enough arrows can be tricky. You'll likely ditch the stealth once you unlock Ellie's devastating Rambo-style explosive arrows, and we wouldn't blame you.You can also take down enemies from range with the hunting rifle or Molotov cocktails, lay craftable explosive proximity traps or simply run and gun. We often found ourselves beginning encounters stealthily, until we inevitably fumbled and had to start shooting.The game adds a few new enemies including Stalkers, sneaky and quick enemies which are hard to spot using Ellie's listen mode. Plus Shamblers, which push out big acid clouds. The human enemies are split between the WLF (Washington Liberation Front) military-style gang, who occasionally use dogs to track you down, and Scars (Seraphites), a back-to-basics cult who use more axes and bows. Outside of combat, the bulk of your time will be spent working your way through areas, occasionally by horse or boat, or searching for items. Upgrading is the same as the first game, with scrap used to improve guns with attachments and all-purpose pills used to improve your many abilities.You'll need to find various combat manuals before unlocking the relevant skill trees, but we found more than enough pills to max out the skills we liked by searching areas thoroughly. The skills improve things like crafting speed, melee strength and the amount of items you can create. You can also improve the explosive range of weapons and your aiming stability. Thankfully, each of these little improvements are pretty noticeable in gameplay, so nothing feels like too much of a waste.We reviewed the game on a standard PlayStation 4 console, so some of the graphical fidelity might be stronger on a PS4 Pro. Nevertheless, the game looks stunning and is certainly a huge leap compared to the PS3 original and the remastered version.Snow leaves realistic footprints, water runs like in real life and looks convincingly murky when you're forced to dive into it, which is handy, as you spend most of your time soaked in the game's main setting of Seattle.The world's buildings, roads, shops and rivers have crumbled in so many ways, while nature has taken hold in a much more visible way. The game really doesn't feel like you're moving through blocky levels that have been designed, so the variety across the locations of Seattle, Washington, Jackson and Wyoming is really impressive.However, our two biggest takeaways graphically from The Last of Us 2 were the facial animations and gore. The former sees playable characters and NPCs reacting to conversations, weather, heights and combat in real time, which is damn impressive. The tone of the conversations Ellie has are reflected on her face, as is the impending doom of those that she kills. Similarly, the gore in this game is horrifically realistic, enemies lose limbs, heads and get separated from their bodies entirely after explosions and using the shotgun, their blood, brains and sinew paint the areas they die in. Given its realistic setting, this could definitely be the goriest game we've ever played – and we count the likes of Manhunt, Doom: Eternal and God of War.The Last of Us: Part 2 definitely feels like a passionate, all-consuming companion to the first game. Plus, there's progressive LGBTQ+ representation through Ellie's relationship with Dina, as well as a trans character later in the story, which is too rare in video games.The campaign is a massive journey, which took just over 30 hours to complete on the standard difficulty. Sadly, the first game's online mode Factions doesn't return, but the developer has explained it might return to the format at some stage so fans can experience ""the fruits of our team's online ambition"".Overall, The Last of Us 2 is going to be divisive. Naughty Dog has made brave narrative choices for its difficult second album, which we massively respect. We would just have liked to have seen the same applied to the gameplay. It's still solid and thrilling, and if you loved the first game, this is a must-play. It's not as groundbreaking, but equally as heartbreaking.The Last of Us: Part 2 release date: June 19, 2020Available on: PS4Developer: Naughty DogPublisher: Sony Interactive EntertainmentBuy The Last of Us: Part 2 on PS4Digital Spy reviewed The Last of Us: Part 2 on a standard PlayStation 4 console.Digital Spy now has a newsletter – sign up to get it sent straight to your inbox.Looking for more TV recommendations and discussion?

The Last of Us Part II,Rob Larkin,Gaming Nexus,https://www.gamingnexus.com/Article/6126/The-Last-of-Us-Part-II-Review/,"While I will endeavor to keep this review spoiler-free with respects to The Last of Us Part II, I make no promises about the original game. But if we’re being honest, why on earth are you, dear reader, even reading this if you haven’t already played Part I? Stop reading now, close the browser, and go find a copy of the The Last of Us for either PS3 or Remastered on PS4 and play through it before you even think about coming back here. Are you back yet? Good…In my opinion, The Last of Us, the original, was the single finest game of the PS3/Xbox 360 console generation. Naughty Dog snuck it in right under the wire the summer of 2013. It was sandwiched by a few months between the official announcement of the PS4 in the spring and its release in the fall of that year. With everyone salivating at the next-gen tech and waiting with bated breath on its promise, Naughty Dog had found a way to eke every last pixel out of the PS3 to make the most visually stunning game of the era. They wrapped the beauty of the world around a story that was heartfelt, heart wrenching, and gorgeous all at once. The Remastered version of the game would appear just a year later, updated for the hardware of the PS4. The best game of the last gen probably sits in the top five of this gen as well. The Last of Us is all about the story. Ultimately the main plot line is one of a journey. Yes, there are zombies, and villains, and scarcity of resources in a post-apocalyptic world to manage. But really it’s just about a little girl who acts tough growing into the maturity to actually be able to cash those checks her mouth has long been writing. It’s about a grizzled old man chipping away at the walls around his own heart, breaking down the code of rules which have kept him safe thus far. It’s about the development of these two along the long and winding road laid before them. But it’s all about the story, because what surrounds the story is a fairly straightforward gameplay experience.My colleague Sean calls out the gameplay in much harsher terms than I would use, but he's not entirely wrong. In his words, “the combat, stealth, crafting, survival horror, and exploration have all been done better by older games.” And while he readily admits these aspects “are extremely well done,” he also concludes, ""there’s nothing groundbreaking” about the mechanics. But I think Sean's admission in his very first sentence is where he cheated himself—the part where he “remembered why I’ve only ever gotten a few hours into it and resorted to watching Lets Plays.”If you don’t play through this game, then you're never really going to open up that opportunity to let that story resonate. Even if the gameplay mechanics don’t excite you, recognize that they were crafted seamlessly enough that they won’t frustrate you either, and you can waft your way through the motions of executing them to drive your own journey through the narrative that Naughty Dog is trying to tell. Moving the joystick forward through a simple walking and talking scene puts you in the shoes of the protagonists in a way hitting play on YouTube never will be able to do. And the pace of actually directing the characters forward from cutscene to cutscene is labored—to the point that it provides the space to get lost in that world if you're the one actually behind the controller, but surely just bored by it when you’ve simply tuned in to someone else's stream. Watching The Last of Us disconnects you from the actions, and slows down the experience to one that can’t hope to be as captivating as living through it by playing. Because beyond that main plot line are the other narratives that weave their way in and out with every chapter, the stories that surround the story. Stories you might miss if only half-invested in a stream versus driving the game camera along the world and locations that spell them out. Because while Joel and Ellie might be on their journey, they do so through a world that is scarred and bears the wounds all too poignantly. Sometimes this world reveals itself via its ashes, in long abandoned and forgotten places that once were alive but have seen tragedy run its course. The fates of the inhabitants of those that lived before the fall reveal themselves in the hollowed out shells of the homes you pass, the carcass of a society, and morality, that has been forgotten. The fates of those who survived, even if only for a little while, also unfold in their new settlements built on top of the infrastructure of that forgotten one. Sometimes it plays out by the scrawls on a note left behind, sometimes its scrawled across the walls in blood. But every location, every chapter, every place not only serves as the route by which our heroes make their way to the end of the first game, but they all reveal their own histories if you care to stop and observe.This is where we pick up the sequel, both in time and place. In and surrounded by the stories of that larger world. The opening cutscene is Joel confessing to his brother about the choices he made at the end of the first game. We start to establish that there are no heroes in this brave new world. Every action is a shade of gray. It’s not that everyone is depraved and evil, but when everyone’s staring down the barrel of a gun at one another, one person’s struggle for liberty and life becomes another's tragedy of loss and death. The difference being who pulled the trigger first.The conclusion of the first game pits Joel and his desperation to save Ellie at odds with a chance to save the world via her sacrifice. That little girl had wriggled her way into a void in his heart vacated when he lost his own daughter many years prior. Now her sacrifice could produce a cure to the Cordyceps virus that has ravaged the earth and created this zombie pandemic. But Joel couldn’t let the one life he loves to slip even for the benefit of the many, though to be fair to Joel in an unfair world he had been jaded by, he probably hadn’t seen much good or reason to justify the sacrifice for the sake of the many anyway. So Joel basically murdered his way out of a heavily fortified hospital, killing doctors and soldiers alike, dooming humanity from ever realizing a cure, but saving the life of a child he had grown to cherish as his own.   ""Sooner or later everyone sits down to a banquet of consequences.""– Robert Louis StevensonThese are the types of choices that set into motion all the mechanisms of The Last of Us Part II. One crew kills a member of another. The other seeks and exacts their revenge, only to begin the cycle anew with every party aggrieved and seeking their pounds of flesh. Two tribes at war in an unsteady peace, one misstep later and both are right back at each others throats, filling up the morgues with comrades and friends, neither willing to shoulder any blame for whatever it was that did reignite the powder keg in the first place. The original was a game that didn’t need a sequel. Until, that is, we got this sequel which rightly turns everything on its head. We’ve moved beyond two sides of a relationship and now get the perspective of two sides of a war.You will be given perspective in this game beyond the narrow-minded focus of the predecessor. This is not just Joel and Ellie’s journey this time around. You will go to war with the WLF, kill many members who stand in the way of your revenge, even slay their dogs, only to later wander through their own barracks and realize they weren’t just a gang of murderous thugs but tended to children in a school tucked away in the belly of their compound. You will see the kennels where the pooches just want to play fetch, a world away from the bloodthirsty monsters they appear when charging at your hiding place teeth bared. You will be ambushed by the religious zealots, the Seraphites. You will hear their whistles as they coordinate their assault without words and flank your position and later read the scribbled notes that unfold why desperate souls would be drawn to them in the first place. The purpose behind The Last of Us is to tell the story. It was true in the first iteration and remains the central driving force of Part II. In other games the point of playing might be in the simplicity of the buttons you mash to progress but here the gameplay serves more to envelop you in the world it crafts around you. While again not making any claim to be groundbreaking, the gameplay of Part II is entirely functional, it is done extremely well, and it does expand on that from the first game. Skill branches are introduced and the powerups can be leveled via linear paths along a handful of disciplines. You can invest points into weapon handling, stealth, crafting, etc., as you would prefer to help your playstyle. You can approach many of the various checkpoints in whichever way you prefer—sneak past with stealth, pick off enemies one at a time, go guns blazing. It’s up to you, but you will always be challenged by a lack of resources if you choose the latter option. The weapons you use also have significant upgrade options, from stability and accuracy perks to adding scopes, larger mags, or even upping the stopping power. The arsenal is largely similar to the first game, but the bow ends up taking a much larger role in this one. Each weapon is powerful enough to get the job done when used at a range and scenario that plays to its strengths but also balanced just so that you will never mistake your character for Superman. Challenges must be approached intelligently, you will never be able to run in with overwhelming force.The gameplay will move at a familiar clip. Exposition in the cutscenes will move the game forward to exploration of the next chunk of world, oftentimes with navigation puzzles. Maybe you need to boost up a wall with a companion, maybe you need find a path to cross a divide. It’s familiar, but also much more understated than the first game. I felt Part II was much less puzzle heavy than Part I was. While there were challenges presented, it wasn’t nearly as reliant on manipulating a ladder or floating pallet to get past every last section. This is all presented in an expanded world. While the imagined geographical space covered is actually much smaller, each individual locale is much more built out. Part I started in the Quarantine Zone of Boston and finally ended in a Hospital in Salt Lake before an epilogue tacks you back to Jackson. This game ditches the cross country trek and restricts itself to Jackson and Seattle. Even the 800 miles between the two is glossed over in a cutscene, but once there every location map that stitches together to make up the respective cites are so much bigger than those earlier settings. This game, however, is still played somewhat on rails. Even in the increased play spaces, you will need to get to points A, B, and C to pass a given level. Between those points are hollowed-out buildings and side paths that often are entirely optional to explore. In a very early level, collecting intel in downtown Seattle, the game almost takes on an open world feel in that playground. But once the objectives are met and you progress past the gate of next checkpoint it does settle back down into the more linear experience.  If we’re being unkind we would label certain stretches of the game as a walking simulator. There are portions where there is basically a whole lot of nothing going on, but this time serves as something much more than filler. These are the moments when, as the player, you are given the time and space to marinate on the the characters, the world they inhabit, and development of their own journeys therein. It is all presented in that classic Naughty Dog style and attention to detail. It’s not just the size of the world that builds the narrative. It’s not just the detail in the backstory of even long-dead corpses you cross paths with. It’s not just the gorgeous overgrown scenery that brings it all to life. It’s the way Ellie steps out into the rain and the droplets start collecting on her jacket. The way she will pull up her hood against that rain to protect herself from the elements until the next time she steps back indoors and lets her hair out again. It's the way she extends a hand to brush along a passing obstacle as she walks by. It’s the seamless transitions from gameplay to cutscenes and back again. It’s the micro economy from act to act as cuts and bruises add up on the character models over time, and the macro economy of how those characters grow up and fill out when jumping back and forth between flashback scenes years earlier. And is is absolutely the superb voice acting and direction of the characters from start to finish. There is loving detail in both the performances of the characters and eerie last detail of the world they inhabit. The Last of Us is all about the story, and the difficulty is certainly not there to get in the way. Overly generous checkpoints means you're always making progress. Lack of resources means you will be constantly tempted to abuse that with quick reloads whenever you waste too many bullets on a single target or miss that stealth headshot and instead alert the next group to your presence. The enemy AI is actually quite good when in battles, it’s just that the lack of resources makes these battles too costly to regularly engage in. You will often be joined by companions across the various acts. Occasionally companion AI will block doorways and get in the way. Frustrating but usually fleeting. For the most part the AI companions have great situational awareness. You don’t need to coordinate or order them around. They simply follow your lead on their own autonomy. Stealth kill an enemy with another around the corner, they’ll clean it up for you. Open fire and opt to forgo the element of stealth, they’ll jump right into the fray too. There’s never a complex (and inevitably frustrating) system of commands to learn in order to direct your companions. Their own intuition in reacting to your moves works seamlessly.  This is a game about story, but not one about meaningful choices. You suffer consequences throughout from decisions you never had the agency to make. Just like the grave decision Joel concludes Part I on, the actions in Part II are scripted and unavoidable. You were never given the option not to save Ellie. You never had a choice to sacrifice the one to save the many, or save the one and suffer the cost. But the game did a good enough job of crafting that story. I was never conflicted about the outcome. That becomes the primary challenge for the sequel. You control the characters but move them through pre-scripted actions that only have the appearance of choice. Then you have to suffer those consequences, but if the stories and motivations are not presented perfectly so, the risk is that the experience is cheapened by paths you would have preferred to walk a different way. And this time the narrative revolves entirely around that cause and effect, something that was more ancillary in the first. This time the story is much less one relationship set against the backdrop of saving the world and much more heart of darkness with the foreground of revenge. The first game touches on the brutality of a post-apocalyptic world, this game lives down in the mud in it. But even in that mud, you are just along for the ride. Should you torture this one to extract the info they are loathe to give up, or simply let her die and walk away? Will you abandon a friend to keep a laser-focused path on that vengeance or ally yourself with them and try and work together to make sure everyone gets home alive, revenge be damned? These decisions are not yours to make. They belong to others that you might only follow. And therein lies the rub. Everything is about the story, and when that tale is one that resonates so deeply like the original did in Part I, then all of the blemishes fade away. But if that narrative is not as sufficiently compelling, then you start to realize that the checkpoints are too generous; that I don’t actually have agency in the outcome; that the crafting and survival aspects are really very basic; that the enemy patrol patterns are just patterns to be exploited; that once you’ve had the jolt of the jump scare the first time, every other playthrough will have that same jump at that same moment but likely lack the scare. There is more simplicity in the beautiful journey and two people finding themselves in Part I. In Part II we move to a much more complex tale of how revenge can make monsters of us all. We sit down at the banquet of consequences, but unless the narrative did its job to invest us in those choices the payoff would taste cheap. The verdict… If Part I was a masterpiece of storytelling and games as art, then it is hard to make light of what’s on offer in Part II. It extends the gameplay, make small adjustments that largely work for a better experience, expands the world with new locations that are even more detailed than before, and brings the loose ends from the first back home to roost. But even though it is marginally better or at least an extension of the first experience in just about every way, how lost you are willing to get in this new tale really comes down to how intimately that tale resonates with you. And as far as scope and breadth of the story Naughty Dog is trying to tell, they have stretched much farther in their ambition this go around.For me, it only just misses the mark of the first. The choices the developers make to drive the narrative are both brave and bold, and they largely pull it off. There is just that single sliver of disconnect for me, when I can't shake the feeling that I wish I could have taken the road less traveled at certain forks. But that becomes a personal feeling in the end. One that another player might come to quite the opposite conclusion if they, like me in the first game, fully supported the direction those controversial forks took. I supported Joel's action to save Ellie in Part I. Had my own calculus swung in a different direction, I might not have been as enamored with the first as I was and am.Ultimately, I can't call this game perfect, but I can call it compelling. I can say it is an absolute joy to play. I can say it is a natural extension of the first one which was best in class, but takes the story into an entirely new direction, taking a very different path. And here we are, the very end of another console generation, PS5 dropping their games reveal as this review goes live, and Naughty Dog throwing another Last of Us into the conversation as the best game of another generation. This game is all about the story because that story unfolds underneath many layers of authenticity crafted from the actors behind the character models, tiny details in the locations and settings, a labored pace that never feels dull even when it crawls, but gives you the time and space to settle into the skin of who you are controlling. It is not perfect, but it has to be considered another masterpiece. * The product in this article was sent to us by the developer/company. First picked up a game controller when my mother bought an Atari 2600 for my brother and I one fateful Christmas.   Now I'm a Software Developer in my day job who is happy to be a part of the Gaming Nexus team so I can have at least a flimsy excuse for my wife as to why I need to get those 15 more minutes of game time in...

The Last of Us Part II,Dominic Preston,Tech Advisor,https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/games/last-of-us-part-ii-3790347/,"When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence.The Last of Us Part II is not a perfect game, and it’s not even a particularly revolutionary one. But it is a great game.It’s hard to blame Naughty Dog for taking seven years to release a follow-up to The Last of Us, a game so good that it’s widely regarded as one of the 
best on both the PS3 and PS4 thanks to a 2014 remaster.We now know that part of the developer’s approach to the problem was a 
heavy reliance on crunch to get The Last of Us Part II 
out in June, just months ahead of the launch of the 
PS5.That makes it at least a little uncomfortable to admit that Naughty Dog has pulled it off. 
The Last of Us Part II is a worthy sequel in every respect, evolving the original’s gameplay while carrying its story forward into an even more harrowing second part, and it’s available to download around the world right now.The game picks up in Jackson, a peaceful(ish) post-apocalyptic township where Joel and Ellie have settled. Anyone who’s followed the game’s marketing campaign will know that before long tragedy strikes, setting Ellie off on a journey for revenge that takes her back across the country to Seattle.No spoilers here, but it shouldn’t come as a surprise that the game is interested in more than a kick-ass revenge fantasy. Across the 15-20 hour story Naughty Dog repeatedly interrogates perpetuating cycles of violence, asking players to empathise with Ellie’s – and thus their own – enemies and victims.There are no easy answers, and I suspect this story will prove more divisive than the first. It certainly takes more risks, repeatedly subverting expectations in how it tells its tale, even as it fits fairly neatly into a familiar mould of the cautionary revenge story.The game is smaller in scope, for the most part limiting itself to a few days in a single city, but it explores a larger, more diverse cast within that setting. Ellie and Joel return, along with Joel’s brother Tommy, but are nearly upstaged by new additions Dina and Jesse.Neil Druckmann and Halley Gross’s script repeats the first game’s trick of imbuing even minor characters with more heart and soul than most AAA titles bother with for their protagonists. Sentence by sentence, moment by moment, this is the best-written big-budget game since at least God of War, and it’s that quality that will keep players invested through some otherwise familiar story beats.That’s helped by the return of Gustavo Santaolalla on musical duties, playing with a familiar, albeit extended, palette. Music plays an even bigger part in the game through playable guitar sections. They’re admittedly a mixed bag, responsible for some of the game’s sweetest moments as well as one of its clunkiest missteps, but when it works it really works.Improved motion capture and animation help make sure the emotional payload lands. You never quite forget that you’re watching animated characters rather than real-life actors (we’ll have to wait for the 
TV series for that), but the subtler touches of an eyebrow-raise here or a twitch there lend a weight to proceedings that few games manage.There are missteps to the story along the way – most notably a slow-gestating faction war between the militaristic Washington Liberation Front and the cult-like Seraphites that takes too long to say anything deeper than ‘war is bad’.But above all Naughty Dog knows how to treat its characters like people, and it’s this that elevates The Last of Us Part II to being one of this generation’s greats.Of course, this is a game, not just a story, so it has to play well too.Naughty Dog hasn’t reinvented the wheel here either, but instead polished its craft to a shine – perhaps helped by the decision to ditch multiplayer and focus all its attention on the campaign.The immediate difference is that for the most part you play as Ellie, not Joel. That makes you smaller, quieter, and sneakier, but also faster and more agile. The result is a renewed emphasis on stealth, with an enhanced toolkit for stalking enemies, staying hidden, and getting the hell out of dodge when it all goes wrong.That means crouching or crawling through grass to avoid detection, taking silent headshots with the bow or silenced pistol, and using smoke bombs or trip mines to keep enemies off your back – with a heavy swing of a spiked baseball bat as your backup.Ultimately combat settles into a similar rhythm to the first game – sneak, kill, go guns blazing when all else fails – but there’s a little more variety along the way to that inevitable firefight.The sort of enemies you’ll fight remain mostly the same as before – infected fungus zombies and groups of heavily armed humans – and if there’s a disappointment to the core gameplay loop it’s that there aren’t more new enemy types.The only addition even worth mentioning is the hunting dogs, which will use Ellie’s scent to track her behind any cover. This forces you to stay on the move whenever dogs are in the area – no hunkering down to wait for stray goons to wander by – and throws in the added challenge of trying to simultaneously eliminate both a dog and its handler without giving yourself away to everyone else.It goes without saying that fighting dogs eventually means killing dogs, and The Last of Us Part II doesn’t fall into the Uncharted trap separating story from combat. Yes, Ellie has to get violent – often unpleasantly so – but that is part of her arc across the story, as it builds you up to putting down whimpering dogs and executing unarmed combatants. This is not a game for the faint of heart, but it engages with that violence rather than quietly excusing it.Improved enemy AI adds to the effect. One of the biggest shocks in the game for me came as I emptied my pistol firing at an enemy only for him to actually notice and shout to his buddies that I was out of ammo. Reader, I panicked.Smarter enemies add more challenge of course, but the game mostly manages this well, with an ebb and flow of intense, challenging encounters and more manageable moments. Pacing as a whole is equally strong, with only a few missteps when it bogs Ellie down with an hours-long trudge across Seattle to get to the next plot point.Finally, a shout out to difficulty’s awkward bedfellow: accessibility. Naughty Dog has really gone above and beyond in adding options to remap controls, tweak visuals and audio, and even account for those with colour blindness, motion sickness, and visual or auditory impairments. You can even access all those settings before the first cut-scene kicks in. None of this may affect you in the slightest, but it’s fantastic to see so many options there, and it’s something the industry should champion.The Last of Us Part II is not a perfect game, and it’s not even a particularly revolutionary one. But it is a great game.Naughty Dog has approached the sequel with a level of craftsmanship and detail that’s unusual in AAA, and from a writing standpoint alone this game is almost unmatched.The Last of Us 2 is powerful, occasionally shocking, and often challenging to play – emotionally as well as in the more traditional sense. It’s not always enjoyable or fun, but it’s hard to imagine a worthier sequel to an all-time great.Tech Advisor's Deputy Editor, Dom covers everything that runs on electricity, from phones and laptops to wearables, audio, gaming, smart home, and streaming - plus he's a regular fixture on the Tech Advisor YouTube channel.Tech Advisor's Deputy Editor, Dom covers everything that runs on electricity, from phones and laptops to wearables, audio, gaming, smart home, and streaming - plus he's a regular fixture on the Tech Advisor YouTube channel.PhonesLaptopsTabletsWearable TechHome TechSecurityDigital Magazine - SubscribeNewsletters"
The Last of Us Part II,Paul Sullivan,COGconnected,https://cogconnected.com/review/last-us-part-2-review/,"**This review contains no story spoilers for The Last of Us Part 2**“Everything that I’ve done. It can’t be for nothing.” Those words shook me up when Ellie said them in The Last of Us. To me, it was perfect. Nothing was left to be said. This girl, forced to grow up too fast, to do things no one should have to, somehow grasped the core struggle of so many people’s existence. That’s why I didn’t think the world needed The Last of Us Part 2. I understand people’s hesitation. But now, on the other side, I see the purpose. The Last of Us Part 2 means something.Naughty Dog knows how to tell a story. In pacing, framing, and the ability to deliver emotional weight they have very few peers. Screen time is never wasted. The story constantly surges ahead, and yet, it knows exactly when to let itself breathe. In the quietest moments, when the music fades away and the weight of the world sits atop the characters’ shoulders, they bear that weight brilliantly.Underpinning everything in The Last of Us Part 2 is the writing. This is no ho-hum, boilerplate narrative. Motivations are believable because the story puts in the work, and rounds out characters exceptionally well. Everything is overflowing with symbolism, mood, and passion, and every character moment is deliberately in service to the themes. Extended dialogue sequences – the kind that could easily allow a mind to wander – generate unbreakable focus. I hung on desperately, waiting for the next subtle words to escape Joel’s lips, or for Ellie’s fiery temper to flare. The characters here feel like people who drive the plot forward. They’re never wooden, and they’re anything but simple plot devices.Anytime Gustavo Santaolalla’s moving soundtrack faded down, my focus intensified. The actors gobble up the script hungrily, turning in passionate, often gut-wrenching performances across the board. I found Ashley Johnson and Troy Baker’s work particularly moving, both in delivery and via the exceptionally high quality motion capture. The weight of the situation hangs off characters’ faces with startling realism, subtle mood changes seamlessly reflected.Even the remnants of civilization strewn around help build the world into a fully realized reality. Notes in nearby places often vaguely refer to the same people or events, and Ellie’s reactions to those notes – delayed just enough for it to seem that she read the note along with you – further reinforce my feelings. The Last of Us Part 2 feels like a real world, and more specifically, it feels like it could be our world.It’s built to challenge you. Everyone has expectations and biases, especially when it comes to a beloved world like The Last of Us. You’ve probably got an idea of what you want to see happen to your favorite characters, and The Last of Us Part 2 very specifically works to make you uncomfortable. It effectively weaponizes your perceptions against you. The way fate, resignation, and desire factor into the story is brilliant.On a technical level too, everything is specifically targeted toward creating immersion and believability. The game is utterly gorgeous. Great care has obviously been taken here, again in service to the believability I keep referring to. Early on, while riding through the coastal rainforest near Seattle, I was shocked how well real life was being mimicked. Environmental asset quality is almost silly, holding up to even the closest scrutiny in the game’s photo mode. Aggressive film grain lends a sense of grit to even the most mundane of scenes, while gorgeous lighting and environmental effects had my jaw on the floor. The standout? The way infectious spores hang in the air, illuminated by flashlight.Animations are amazingly dynamic across the board, with each action playing out differently from different approach angles. Ellie adjusts remarkably smoothly, stepping sideways before opening a drawer, or stumbling slightly into a railing after landing on a set of stairs, or winding up a rope differently depending on which end you picked up. Occasionally you’ll see a character slide into an animation though. The seams are there, but they’re almost perfectly obscured.It’s astounding not just in terms of what they’ve pulled out of the PS4, but in art direction too. One of my favorite moments happened during regular old gameplay, while climbing onto a roof. Ellie glanced skyward uncertainly as the wind started to whip. As she pulled up her hood, I panned the camera back toward the Seattle skyline behind her. The rain was sheeting across the street in the way only Pacific Northwest rain can, and I couldn’t help just staring at it. A stunning mix of familiar and otherworldly, gawking at the attention to detail in The Last of Us Part 2 became a regular part of my time with the game.There’s a lot to gawk at. Open areas are sprawling and gorgeous, staying locked at 30fps (or damn near) across the board. The Last of Us Part 2 is the most ambitious game Naughty Dog has made, but they’ve also struck a superb balance. Logic tells me that there must be constraints to the areas you can explore, but in practice it never feels that way. Traversal between areas feels supremely organic, with multiple paths you might choose to go from A to B. It’s a testament to ND’s level designers that despite a good deal of backtracking to try different approaches, I very rarely ran into a direction I couldn’t go. The feeling of boundless freedom is a constant throughout the game, including encounters with enemies.Combat is very much about space, and how you choose to use it. Ellie isn’t a superhero, and she can’t outmuscle opponents. To succeed, you’ve got to play to her strengths: sneaking around, agility, and cheap shots. Stealth is more nuanced than simply hidden vs revealed, and much like in real life, breaking line of sight gives you some quick reprieve during combat. Quickly hiding after being spotted, or revealing yourself briefly to gain a tactical advantage aren’t concepts often seen in survival games, and it’s one of mechanics I’m in love with here. There’s so much diversity in how to approach every situation that the game includes the option to replay specific encounters with various modifiers once you’ve completed the story.In those moments where everything goes sideways, The Last of Us Part 2 is incredibly tense. Ellie moves quickly, bobbing and weaving like Muhammed Ali, but while balanced on a knife edge. Everything the story, characters, and writing do to build an immersive environment makes escaping danger feel like a fight for your life. And in a fight for your life, actions can be brutally gory. Even nausea inducing. If the damage caused in combat isn’t fully dynamic, there’s an astronomical library of canned damage available.When Ellie sinks a machete into someone’s shoulder, or unleashes a shotgun at point blank range, you feel it. Not just the impact of the outstanding sound design, but in the ripples of reaction those actions cause. From a look of disgust and resignation on Ellie’s face, to a terrified attempt to escape after blowing an enemy’s hand off, Naughty Dog’s attention to detail makes your actions feel like there are far reaching consequences, even if they’re never seen. Sometimes they are seen, and those moments are truly difficult to watch. Disturbing as it is, those are the moments you’ll truly come to know the characters in The Last of Us Part 2.Still, The Last of Us Part 2 is a mechanical evolution, not a revolution. The bones of the current gen still show through at times, like when making it through a door somehow saves you from danger, or when you’re able to skirt around a table several times without being spotted. Some of these mechanical complaints are solved on higher difficulty levels, but in a world that goes as far as possible toward devastating realism, anything that pulls you out of it stands out in a magnified way.Something that’s evolved for the better is the sense of progression in The Last of Us Part 2. By gathering supplements and pieces of scrap, Ellie can upgrade her weapons and skills. No surprise there, but weapons and skill books can be missed if you aren’t looking closely or cracking open enough safes along the way. Even once you’re able to upgrade things, there’s nowhere near enough resources to max everything out. Selecting a path requires some hard thought about your play style: odds are you can’t afford a scope for your rifle and a new pistol grip.The Last of Us Part 2 is uncomfortably real. It’s gritty, heavy, and polished to a mirror sheen. Even now, a week on from completing it, I’m feeling its weight. It’s far from what I anticipated, but crucially it did the work to get me invested. An astounding technical marvel, The Last of Us Part 2 deftly weaves diverse exploration and fun combat into the mix, resulting in a truly brilliant package.**Review copy provided by Sony Interactive Entertainment**Developer: Naughty DogPublisher: Sony Interactive Entertainment"
The Last of Us Part II,Kai Powell,Wccftech,https://wccftech.com/review/the-last-of-us-part-ii-all-the-sins-we-bear/,"The Last of Us Part II builds off of the ambiguous ending to the first game and spins it into a narrative that is both bleak and gut-wrenching. For a world wrecked by the aftermath of an infection on the scale of a zombie infection, any hope for survival might rest on the shoulders of a young teenager that holds the secret of immunity in her blood. In The Last of Us Part II, the latest game from The New Dogs at Naughty Dog, this is one PlayStation 4 exclusive you won't want to miss if you have the stomach for it.The apocalypse takes something from us all. Whether it's a sense of comfort, something we hold dear, stability, a loved one, nothing is held sacred when that safety net of society comes crashing down and those left alive are forced to pick up the pieces and try to put their lives back together. Those not infected by the cause of civilization's downfall in The Last of Us' world are expected to survive by any means necessary. For some, that means assuming the role of a scavenger or brigand, taking from those that have. For others, it could be setting up something resembling a commune or military leadership. Fanaticism and idol worship can be another coping mechanism for dealing with the sudden trauma of losing everything one holds dear. Each of these are represented with the various factions and lifestyles of those trying just to survive in Seattle, the primary setting for The Last of Us Part II.The two major players vying for control of Seattle are the Washington Liberation Front (WLF, for short) and the Seraphites, referred to by derogatory terms like Scars by other groups. Navigating towards Ellie's goal within the city requires avoiding and often confronting these factions throughout the many-hour campaign. No one group is ever labeled as the savior or antagonist throughout Ellie's journey. Through world storytelling and discovered conversations, each faction is fleshed out so that you may see the reasoning behind everyone's actions. With Ellie often forced into a grey morality, there's justification for her actions beyond simply trying to stay alive but Neil Druckmann's story being told is so heavily focused on the human cost of simply trying to stay alive.Without a doubt, The Last of Us Part II is among the most depressing and bleak narratives told on PlayStation, especially for a AAA title. It's not just about the coming down from an adrenaline high after surviving an encounter with infected or looters but rather the aftermath of taking a life. All throughout Seattle are signs of a world that's been well-lived in since the outbreak first came about and often without any signs of recent life. It's a bleak world to explore, made even worse with the constant threat of collapsing floors and various factions wanting to keep you from venturing any further. The infected are still a crucial part of the story, but it's the humans that are often the most dangerous.Very similar to the first game, The Last of Us Part II is a stealth survival game at its core. Resources remain limited and often times sneaking past is better than fighting and expending your last few rounds of ammunition. Ellie's superhuman hearing is an important tool for navigating the corridors of strategically overturned couches and chest-high walls to get around encounters. Because of the scarcity of ammo, trying to find more pacifist ways to get past an encounter can be equally as important as clearing out the enemies and looting whatever you can come across to replenish your stocks. I often found myself settling for the latter because of the insatiable desire for collectibles (I acquired over two hundred during my playthrough and still missed a number) and supplements. Supplements remain the core way to upgrade abilities and unlock new passive traits, such as being able to survive a single fatal blow or crafting more arrows with the same amount of resources. Many of the skill upgrade paths require picking up collectible magazines scattered throughout Seattle to unlock and I wouldn't be surprised if they were completely missable. Though for the sake of clarity, I intentionally missed a map early on during my new game plus playthrough and it showed up again in a different location later on, so perhaps the same could be said for the skill books as well.The Last of Us Part II's AI is bloody fantastic and among the best that I've seen in a stealth game. Each faction that you go toe-to-toe with often outnumbers you greatly and uses those numbers to their advantage differently. When trying to escape a band of Seraphites, they'll often use the overgrowth of Seattle fauna to hide from view and communicate through whistling calls when they spot the player, while the WLF might take a more militaristic approach. Enemies all feel like they behave differently with various levels of aggression AI and it's rare to be able to take the same critical path through an encounter between playthroughs (and I absolutely picked up and started my second playthrough once I had time to digest the ending). Most encounters end with some sort of locked door or obstacle to clear that both takes time to clear and causes a lot of noise. If you are immensely careful and able to use stealth to your advantage, sometimes it's possible to make it through without adding another tick to Ellie's growing body count.Even on Hard Mode (without any of the adjustable sliders enabled), resources are not scarce enough that you'll ever be completely out of options in a combat encounter. Ellie's backpack may only be able to carry a handful of shells and arrows at any given time but that's usually enough to dispatch the various foes you're up against. Melee weapons litter the moderately-sized combat arenas, as do bottles and bricks for thrown distractions, and Ellie's toughened CQC abilities actually make her far more deadly than the first time we got to play as her. Ellie no longer has access to the disposable shivs that were an essential part of the first game's arsenal but the years of running patrols around the Jackson, Wyoming outpost have given her some useful new abilities.There's no longer a dedicated counter button as there was in the first entry in The Last of Us. Instead, there's a dodge button that forces Ellie or her companion to duck and scuttle out of an enemy attack. It may not work against clickers, as they once again return as the obnoxious one-hit-kill enemy type, but for every other faction of enemy that isn't wielding a firearm, it's the single most effective tool of survival. The fluidity to the animation of waving out of range from an opponent's deadly swing to counter with a few quick knife slashes and backing off once again is a delicate dance that shows just how smooth Naughty Dog's combat animations have gotten without being locked into canned moves and animations.Naughty Dog wants as many players to be able to sit down and suffer through their sequel of loss and survival, no matter their skill levels. The Last of Us Part II features some of the most incredible levels of accessibility and difficulty customization that I've ever seen in an action game. If you still want challenging combat but find more ammo scattered around, there's an option for that. Have difficulty with low-light vision and darkened environments? Enemy and ally models can be highlighted to help spot them more easily. For completionists like myself, there's even an enhanced listening mode option that helps to ping anything collectible (as well as enemy locations) to help discover ammo caches or long lost artifacts for Ellie's trading card collection. Adding in a strong support for subtitles for those hard of hearing was only the beginning and I have to applaud Naughty Dog for being so willing to provide enough accessibility to help any player that wants to take this survival journey a way forward.The massive Elliephant in the room with The Last of Us Part II is of course in its depiction of violence. There's no escaping it: sometime during your time spent holding a controller, someone will die, whether it's by your hand or an enemy getting the upper hand. When that happens, the level of gore and sheer variety of ways to die can be completely unsettling. Getting grabbed by a clicker, for example, results in a split second of screaming followed by a fade to black but not before watching your main character get their jaw forcibly ripped apart. Ellie can use special finishers known as Strikes one an enemy is off-balance or unaware that kill the enemy in some brutal fashion depending on the temporary melee weapon she's wielding.If the gameplay is this brutal, what about the cutscenes to The Last of Us Part II? These are often much, much darker and in-depth than any action you'll undertake holding a controller. The emotional weight to these scenes for even minor enemy combatants has such a staggering effect on the player that I couldn't in good conscience recommend this game to anyone squeamish at the sight of blood and viscera. All of the torturing, the bludgeoning, the shooting of guard dogs, everything that Ellie undertakes on the path of revenge builds towards the story's conclusion in a brilliant, demented fashion like a train wreck that's impossible to look away from. This all builds to an ending that once the credits began to tick away and I was serenaded by the credits rolling, I simply had to sit there in silence to try and digest everything that took place.The Last of Us Part II package as a whole is much more to take in than any of Naughty Dog's previous works and I don't just mean that with the constitution needed to sit through the sheer amount of death onscreen. From the first time you pick up the controller to the last, the whole adventure marks the longest-running time in Naughty Dog's history. My final hour count came close to the thirty-hour mark for a single playthrough. I will admit that there wasn't a small amount of time spent scouring the corners of each combat arena and abandoned highrise apartment in search of trading cards and supplements but the entire narrative still isn't much shorter than that.The first steps into Seattle on horseback introduce Ellie to an overgrown, open-world section of the city that gives player agency to explore around at their own discretion, complete with optional areas that can be missed completely and objectives that can be tackled at the player's discretion. It was moments like this that took away from the gut-punching narrative to let the player think about their actions in a solemn, reverent fashion. At times, The Last of Us Part II can feel bloated with the developers perhaps putting too much into their survival horror narrative and that could perhaps be my sole critical opinion of the adventure as a whole.There isn't a single other game available on PlayStation 4 that can capture the bleakness of what Naughty Dog has created with this experience, save for the first The Last of Us. It's a harrowing narrative that can club you in the face with the message that this world just isn't fair for anyone. From a critical opinion, The Last of Us Part II is one of the finest pieces of cinematic gaming ever created, but Naughty Dog's final sendoff to this console generation might leave you crying in the shower.Review code provided by the publisher.The Last of Us Part II is bleak and at times leaves the player feeling hopeless as they play through one of the finest crafted pieces of gaming ever to grace a home console.

The Last of Us Part II,Sammy Barker,Push Square,http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/last_of_us_part_ii,"GuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpThe Last of Us: Part II2020 8.5Game RatingUser Ratings: 317Our Review: Scroll DownAn eye for an eyeVersion Reviewed: PS4 Pro / EuropeanThe Last of Us: Part II is a tale of obsession, and developer Naughty Dog clearly knows a thing or two about that. This is a painstakingly dense sequel, and it’s so tightly intertwined with the original that it’s effectively essential material for anyone who has reverence for the original release. While it continues to iterate upon the cinematic style that the Californian company has been pioneering since Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, new gameplay wrinkles make for more dynamic combat experiences, while the scope of its setting is perhaps only matched by Red Dead Redemption 2.This is not an open world game like Rockstar’s critically acclaimed Spaghetti Western, of course, but it is big. With a running time of around 30 hours, Ellie’s adventure will take you on a journey through an obscenely detailed Seattle, meticulously brought to life by some of the best artists in the industry. No two buildings are the same, with each explorable interior harbouring its own stories about the individuals that lived and worked in them.Just as The Last of Us realised the studio’s ambition for the PlayStation 3 era, its successor feels like a product of the ideas it explored in Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End and Uncharted: The Lost Legacy. Wide-linear environments take centre stage, giving you options to explore off the beaten path. There are housing estates for you to investigate and entire shopping districts for you to discover, all rendered in unparalleled fidelity.And on top of this is a fiction that feels much larger than the characters you encounter within it. Following the events of the first game, the Fireflies have disbanded, and two new factions have formed in the Seattle area – each with opposing views. The Washington Liberation Front is militaristic and organised, while the Seraphites (or Scars, as they’re more colloquially known) are religious zealots inspired by the teachings of a prophet who rose to notoriety following the collapse of the society we know.Behind all of this is the deadly cordyceps infection, which serves as an ominous backdrop bringing out the desperation in its cast. You play as Ellie, who’s now a fully-grown woman and an established member of a community named Jackson, which serves as a refuge for survivors in this post-apocalyptic world. A series of events which we’re sworn to secrecy about prompt the protagonist to leave the sanctuary of her home and embark on a quest for revenge.The story is ambitious, utilising flashbacks and overlapping narratives to excellent effect. It’s engrossing stuff, and while some may feel uncomfortable with some of the topics it dares to tackle, that’s by design. No one is necessarily good or evil in this universe: there are simply shades of grey, and the conclusions you come to will depend upon your own interpretation. It’s a violent world, though, and where other titles revel in this, here you’ll be left uneasy.This is best observed during combat encounters. Pick off an enemy with a stealthy stab to the neck, and you’ll watch them gag on their own blood as they crumple to the ground, gargling desperately. Comrades who detect their lifeless bodies will call out their name, lamenting the loss of a friend and forcing them to search for you more vigorously. But just as you steal away the companions of others, the fragility of your own associates’ mortality is always on display.This makes shootouts particularly fraught affairs, and they’re elevated by the fact that Naughty Dog is not afraid to mix and match factions. Some of the best combat encounters see you facing off against warring human mercenaries, while infected linger nearby. With the right tactics you can manipulate your aggressors into fighting against each other, allowing you to thin their numbers and save crucial supplies for future encounters.As with the first game, scavenging is a key element of the gameplay. Different items can be combined in a slick backpack interface, providing you with medical kits and explosives. As before, you’ll need to make tough decisions about what you craft: rags and alcohol can be merged for effective first aid, but maybe you’d be better off using them for a Molotov instead? The pursuit of essential ingredients forces you to comb the environments more thoroughly than ever before, and the scale of the world means that you’ll happen upon copious lore-building artefacts along the way.While we can’t help but feel that the emphasis on written paper notes to reveal sub-plots is beginning to grate, The Last of Us: Part II’s environmental storytelling is so engaging that you’ll actively want to eke out every one of its secrets. Improved traversal pairs with brand new puzzles to make navigation genuinely entertaining, meaning there’s a lot more variety than the first game. Despite its scope, there are still moments where you’ll feel unnecessarily walled in by scenery that can’t be interacted with, but given the scale of the game this is less of an issue than its predecessors.It all looks peerless, too. Naughty Dog’s art department is among the best in the industry, and its interpretation of the apocalypse is both grim and gorgeous. There are dozens of set-piece spectacles throughout the course of the campaign, but the best moments are when the studio manages to find wonder in the otherwise ordinary. For as dark and harrowing as this tale can be, the developer allows moments of real levity, which helps to humanise the characters despite the extraordinary circumstances they find themselves in. The cut-scene direction is on a level above the typical expectation for titles of this ilk.It also sounds exquisite. Special mentions must be reserved for Ashley Johnson, Troy Baker, and Laura Bailey who all excel as the release’s leading cast, but several supporting characters also establish themselves extremely swiftly – owing to great performances and a sharp script. The sound design is similarly stunning, with a 3D audio setting available for those with the requisite hardware which offers a taste of the levels of immersion we can expect from the PlayStation 5.The Last of Us: Part II adds a couple more inches to the already outrageously high bar that Naughty Dog has set for itself. This is the developer’s crowning achievement to date, expanding and improving upon the concepts that it’s been iterating on for over a decade now. Unparalleled presentation combines with an engaging gameplay loop that puts you in the shoes of its characters – and forces you to feel all of the tension and misgivings of its cast. It’s uncomfortable and not everyone will necessarily enjoy its direction, but that’s ultimately what makes it so essential.Outstanding 10/10Scoring PolicyReview copy provided by Sony Interactive EntertainmentPlease note that some external links on this page are affiliate links, which means if you click them and make a purchase we may receive a small percentage of the sale.

I plan to put up an article in the very near future digging into many of your most asked questions, but I'll try to be active here, too, so be sure to copy me into your queries.And remember: under no circumstances is it okay to share spoilers here. Thank you.Great review.Massive fan off the 1st game, very much Looking forwards to playing thisOh nice. A sneaky review dropped on an early Friday morning and it sounds like I'm going to absolutely love it. Can't wait until next week.YES! Screw the haters. Next Friday. Lets. Do. This. What a 24 hours for SonySounds good! I beat the first game again in preparation of this one, and I can't wait!That's a terrific review, Sammy.While I don't wish to be spoiled, I always get a bit annoyed that reviews like this aren't allowed to talk about the story, which is such a key part of games like this.But you've just about covered everything else and have me very excited for next week now. Bring it on!Was there ever any doubt? 😁Great review. Just curious did you have the review written a while ago and just clicked ‘submit’ today?! (or what you press!) looks like another masterclass game though. Can’t wait!@roe There's more discussion to be had on the story for sure, but Sony's embargo was quite strict and honestly there's no point in spoiling it now. It's utterly engrossing.@Alpine021 The review has been written for a little while. Sony gives the media a time and date for when they can release their impressions, and that's just lifted!Hopefully Amazon isn't late this time when delivering their preorders! Look forward to it!Ahahahaha! Can’t believe people thought this game was gonna fail! Think y’all can shut up now, can’t wait until next Friday!!!!!! 😭Most seem.to be agreeing with the review as it's at 95% at the moment on metacrtic with IGN Japan giving it the lowest score of 70, reading that review the reviewer just seems to be nitpicking and moaning for moanings sake.Well done naughty dog.Nice review. I'm on the fence about the semi open world that ND has been moving to since UC4 however, I loved the world of TLOU so this may be a match made in heaven.Regardless, I was always going to play this day one. I bought a Playstation for the first time since the PS2 primarily to play this game and it was the first PS4 game I played and it got me back into gaming big time.@get2sammyb thanks for the review. It confirms what I was hoping for the game, good job explaining without spoiling anything.Can't wait for fridayOh yes! Thanks for the confirmation that this will be the GOTC! (century)OK, I think I'm ready for this. I've been patient, I've avoided spoilers and I'm gonna finally platinum the original this weekend.I've booked days off work to play and told the wife and kids to leave me be for the weekend.@Gilvin You're welcome! You're in for a real treat next week.@Rob_230 Keep in mind this is a PlayStation focused site. See reviews from other sites first.Roll on Friday can't wait. Would have been good if Sony said yesterday after all those trailers actually you can now download the last of us 2 now 😀😀😀 I know wishful thinking lol. But still buzzing after last night's presentation, now just got to wait for ps5 price and release date. Might watch the presentation again while I'm ""working""from home pass another hour lolI can't wait. I'm replaying TLoU now in preparation and I forgot just how violent that can be as you smash heads against walls. It is still one of the best games of This gen even though its a remaster so 2 has a lot to live up to, and it sounds like it will do so without problem.This is going to be my last big PS4 game, I'm saving Ghost for PS5 and going to focus on clearing my backlog and Naughty Dog is the best way so see out a generation.I just hope Amazon sends it out a day or two early. Never happened to me before but hey, always a first time...10 out of 10! Naughty Dog smashes another hit out. Seen other reviews for it & it looks like Sony has another gem of a game. Just as part one was a swan song for the PS3, last of us 2 is the perfect swan song for the ps4. Cannot wait for my copy to arrive next week. Congrats Naughty Dog & Sony. Phenomenal!I mean ND and R* are ALWAYS a MUST-PLAY.@get2sammyb yeah the embargo I know. Been looking forward to the reviews. Hopefully it will be worth replaying too In the future. I’m replaying TLOU remastered now whilst waiting for this.Time to preorder it on psn 😃Great review Sammy cheers! Not too much info beyond what is already known... I only use pushsquare for gaming news so I've avoided all spoilers.. I'm really looking forward to Friday now 👍@get2sammyb must have been hard for you to not talk about this while playing it for the last few weeks!Can't wait till next week, so up for this!!@suikoden I hope it hits 97 to take on Rockstar and Nintendo, Both of which I think are slightly overrated compared to GOW and Spiderman. It does not seem right that Sony does not have a game in the top list even though their studios have ruled this generationI'll wait for the PS5 remastered edition Didn't read the review (sure it's great). I scrolled to the 10/10 and I'm hyyyyped for next week !!!Glad I can spend time in the PS5 reveal topics until then. My soul is ready (I hope) Predictable score!! Not saying it didn't deserve it as I haven't played it myself yet but there was no way this was getting less than a 10...I should get my Special Edition next week - although the first game was not exactly my favourite Naughty Dog game. I am someone that likes to go everywhere, find every collectible etc - even if I don't read them. I hope they don't have 'optional' dialogue that you have to take part in to get a trophy - that bugged me in the first one as it offered little to the overall story.Anyway, I will be getting mine next week...Brilliant stuff, had mine pre-ordered any way from the PS store. Roll on next Friday!Currently replaying the first again just to remind myself of all the events. What strikes me is just how good it is and tlou2 is just is good according to these reviews.Roll on next Friday!Sony playing us like a guitar using a track pad. A killer presentation last night and now this stonking review by @get2sammybWhat a 24 hours to be a gamer.Sold!!!Wait who am I kidding, I didn't need to hear any reviews before buying this game!The first games I bought after getting a PS4 back in early 2017 were all from ND. Uncharted Collection, Uncharted 4 and The Last Of Us Remastered. I had a blast with each and every one of them and no doubt it will be the same with Part II.Naughty Dog, you've done it again!The only review I care about!Thanks Sammy! Next friday seems so far with this huge amount of hype@get2sammyb I know everyone has questions so sorry for that! What do you need for the 3D audio? Will my PlayStation 2.0 headphones do the trick or are we talking specialist gear? ThanksI imagine it has great HDR support. And does it play at 2160 on pro? Good review but no technical stuff. Also will ray tracing etc be added as a patch if I buy the PS5?I cannot wait to play this when it arrives later. Oh wait it's next Friday 😆BOOM!!And another game is batted out the park by Sony and it's studios.The competition are probably still reeling after last nights expo, and now a massive high reviewing tent-pole game comes out the blocks is a huge double whammy.Ghost of Tsushima next and then probably full steam ahead on PS5 until Xmas, how exciting!!@Akurusu You mean reviews from other sites that have contributed to a Metascore of 96 (76 reviews at time of writing)?Didn't read. Just looked at the rating and +- part. Now I'm spoiled that design is restrictive(((.
I'll play it and then return to reading this article. I just like to read reviews AFTER my own playthrough - to check if I agree with the author.What's that i hear? Its the sounds of all the man babies crying that the game is getting critical acclaim. Can't wait and i'm so hyped right now.Average of 96 on Metacritic with almost 80 reviews, most of which are saying it’s better than the first. 1 week to go!@get2sammyb appreciate that but such a heavy review embargo means that none of these reviews out at the moment are really a look at the full gameYou know I respect your view though and you giving it a 10 means a lot. I'm looking forward to getting stuck in myselfGreat review and visually this looks amazing, Naughty Dog are at the top of their game. I'm still not convinced this game is for me and I still have a few games to catch up with first. I hope you all enjoy it and I'll probably pick it up a bit later@get2sammyb Any key differences in performance between PS4 and PS4 Pro? I'm wondering whether to wait and get it on a PS5?@get2sammyb I will be playing this with a high chance my little brother being around, so is there any sexual content or explicit nudity? And what about gore?That was a early review.its 5: 57 in new york now haha.good tosee this game getting good reviews .another naughty 🐕 dog Masterpiece.word up sonI am avoiding reviews so must confess to not reading the article but looked at the score which fills me with joy!@get2sammyb Can you say if the trophy list is any good?and what were the review restrictions imposed on...Who expected anything less?! Simply. Cannot. Wait!Oof, those three 7/10s on Metacritic are probably hurting it's overall score a bit, as well as a lot of 8s that are saying ""Yeah it's good but nothing amazing"". So weird that people talk about ""bloat"" in a 30 hour game like this but give BotW a free pass for having something like 900 korok seeds that typically involve slightly moving a rock to get an annoying little git to pop up.Will have to come back to the review later. Going in completely blind. Starting up TLOU Remastered today.Bring on launch day!@Azzurro82 All I needed to hear. I don’t trust reviews from sites that focus on one brand.@TrueAssassin86x I don’t think reviews from PlayStation/Nintendo/Xbox/PC focused sites are reliable for obvious reasons. I don’t worship your Sony master the same way you do.@Akurusu If you don’t trust platform focused review scores, then trust the 96/95 aggregate on meta/open critic based on almost 80 reviews as of now.Thanks for the excellent review @get2sammyb. Cant wait to play this game. I was gonna just recap the first one on YouTube but this has got me so hyped and gonna replay it instead.I feel like Naughty Dog are to games the equivalent of Scorsese to films. Guaranteed masterpiece.@Akurusu Why they arent easy going on PS exclusive games and i know i want too play it.People trying to sabotage it just had a confirmational bias from the start and/ or were just pursues who couldn't hack the themes. It's kinda sad to think people have nothing better to do than spew futile disdane for a game they clearly never liked from the start, aside from those saying the LGBT themes are an apparent ""agenda"", despite the fact they were still present in the original amd is indicative of people who never read the games and wanted to use the facade that they ""liked the original, but..."" *****. Pathetic and second only to those spreading misinformation and peddling hacked/ leaked footage that ultimatley did the oposite of what the sabotage was trying to do (i.e. build hype). Everything isn't sunshine and rainbows, what game did these people think it was going to be? Regardless, I'm hyped for yet another generation defining rollercoaster experience. The false naratives around this game coupled with the inevitable release only makes their pressed ***** all the more laughable when the rest clock on that the game is nothing like this delusion they constructed. Probably the same morons who started a discourse over a puddle in spiderman, which wouldn't be that surprising given the xbots jumping the bandwagon to purvey their jealousy over another L they taken this gen as an excuse to tey and tarnish hype.My pre download has started......not long to go now. Very excited to jump back into the world of the last of usI still can't trust a lot of these reviews giving it 9s and 10s. I keep wondering if this reviewer is super biased or not.Odd how passionate some are about a game they haven't played yet... looking forward to it but people jumping down others throats for having reservations about it is just childish@TrueAssassin86x I am a fan, you are a fanboy. There’s a difference. Also, you haven’t played the game yet so how can you say the scores are deserved?@Fight_Teza_Fight I saw that & I pointed it out, PushSquare is one of those sites that I don’t trust for PS exclusive reviews. But as for the rest I’ll see when I play the game myself. There have been a handful of times where people loved a game but the critics didn’t and vice versa. I know you can relate.The gameplay honestly looks really boring like most of Naughty Dogs games. I would recommend watching the story on YouTube and saving your $60 for Ghost next month.@Nepp67 What I learned with Pushsquare is if it's exclusive, subtract 3 points off the score.Ah and so begins the shill media's campaign of Naughty Dog ass kissing. Hilarious@TrueAssassin86x yes kiddo because of eveeeeryone who doesn't agree with you is just a troll.@TrueAssassin86x You have to do better. You called me a fanboy because I said I don’t trust reviews from platform focused sites so... yeah. What are you, 12? And just because a game has a good score doesn’t mean the people are going to like it. I explained that earlier.Eh, I’ll get round to it eventually, probably. Who am I kidding, I don’t see myself ever getting round to TLOU games anytime soon!@get2sammyb Dunno if you see this between the deluge of ps5 stuff,but get the impression the hit & run tatics mean a more hetic gameplay style than TLOU? Was quite used to taking things slow in the first game to get as much gear as possible/shiv doors etc. Looks here you can run out of gear really quick unless the different groups take each other out?Wow, I had no idea reviews would come out so early.This has always looked amazing so not surprised. Cant wait for my copy - great to have another quality single player, story driven game 👍Just a sea of 100s (Meta @96!). Good for them. Hopefully sales also great.https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/the-last-of-us-part-ii/critic-reviews@get2sammyb I have tons of questions, but I'll limit it b/c I know you're busy, and even after writing a review seem twisted in knots between not spoiling anything and sworn to secrecy.1. Difficulty? Difficulty settings? Save points? I was greatly annoyed at 2 spots in the first game - building w/ multiple levels, where even if you killed creatures on the first 2 levels and died on the 3rd you had to do the entire building over again; and the restaurant boss, which was just stupid for numerous reasons.2. Ending. Does she wake up and all 3 games were a dream - you never mention the DLC game - or does she wake up from a dream where she is fighting the final boss but then you have to wait for the next game before she actually fights the final boss. 3. Quality of life - is this game ready day 1 or are there going to be updates every single day for the first 2 weeks. I don't like to squint reading.https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2018/05/god_of_war_patch_1_20_adds_photo_mode_on_ps4Ok that's enough for now.@TrueAssassin86x Spiderman 😂😂😂. Silly shill child.https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/6/12/21288535/the-last-of-us-part-2-review-ps4-naughty-dog-ellie-joel-violence#commentsProves what I've thought for a long time about polygon, they have games( apart from Nintendo) but hate Sony more and seem to be a bunch of woke morons!It was to say but that's how most people will behave if something like this happens. A species we a a bunch of uncaring A holes.@rockertherockgod Resolution is the big difference between PS4 and PS4 Pro. I haven't tried it myself, but my understanding is that it still looks and runs great on standard PS4. HDR is awesome on both platforms.@Alpine021 To be honest with you, I'm not 100% sure. I have the PlayStation Wireless Headset 2.0 and it defaults to 3D audio when you toggle the simulated 3D setting on. I'm not sure whether you can do the same with other headphones or not, but I'm guessing you can't.@Dodoo Very difficult! I still can't really talk about it because of spoilers!@rjejr Quick answers:1. There are LOTS of difficulty options, and you can even create your own custom difficulty. You can make resources scarce and combat quite easy, for example, if that's how you prefer it. Or vice versa. You can change difficulty after you start the campaign, so can adjust it to your tastes if you're finding it too hard/easy.2. No.3. It's super polished on v1.02, which I believe is the launch patch. I know they're planning to add a few things post-launch, but not sure if we can talk about that yet. I think you'll be fine re: patches.@Robocod It's an evolution of the original. You definitely can play it more methodically if you prefer that approach. Tons of mobility options mean that I tended to play in a hap-hazard style, though, moving constantly and just using whatever items I had in my arsenal to my advantage.@koaeinferno I rarely replay games but am on my third playthrough here. The gameplay is superb in my opinion.@Nepp67 It's got a 96 on Metacritic. We can't all be wrong!@Mostik Trophy list is achievable.@Alpine021 Just a correction to my previous comment: I have the PLATINUM Wireless headset, which is the one with 3D sound simulation. I think that's the one that supports the 3D audio options.Do you know if you can use 3D audio in Days Gone? If you can, then I assume it'll work for you here as well. But like I say, I'm honestly not 100% certain.@get2sammyb Thank you @get2sammyb level of nudity and gore?@playstation_king Some and high.@get2sammyb Good stuff. Looks like from the limited bits (& trying to forget the troll spoilers from twitter), clickers etc., are gonna be fierce as so need all the ammo,or sneaky takedowns I can manage!Pre download is live now on uk ps store for anyone interested 👍🏻Skipped through the review no disrespect to PushSquare, don't want to really know anything. I knew it would get 10/10 Uncharted, TLOU tells me that. One question, what are the trophies like? Like the original TLOU? Thank you. Cannot wait.Game of the year!How does it run though? Consistent 60 fps or should I wait for the inevitable PS5 version?@get2sammyb How are the clickers in this game? I haven't seen them a lot in trailers. The first game had them 50/50 compared to the human encounters.Paid off my pre-order yesterday, can't wait to play it.@get2sammyb The review says this was played on PS4 Pro, have you also had a chance to play it on a standard PS4? Just wondering about the performance, there were rumors circulating that Naughty Dog was having trouble getting it to run to on the weaker hardware.I guess I should play the first one at some point@get2sammyb""Resolution is the big difference between PS4 and PS4 Pro. I haven't tried it myself, but my understanding is that it still looks and runs great on standard PS4. HDR is awesome on both platforms""Oh brilliant, thanks for the info.@Gamer83 I haven't tried it myself, but I've heard it's fine just lower resolution.@get2sammyb Thanks. Guess I'll find out next week. Not too concerned because Uncharted 4 ran fine and that was a powerhouse game but the rumors were out there so I was just wondering.JUST IMAGINE what Naughty Dog can do with the Playstation 5. These people are masters of both game and machine.@get2sammyb Hi Sammy! You mentioned 3D audio in the review, do you still require a PlayStation headset to receive it? Or has Sony opened it up to all for TLOU. Would be nice to get a taste of their 3D audio prior to the PS5 launch. Cheers@STLamy I think you need the PlayStation Platinum headset for the 3D audio, but I'm going to do a test with standard ear buds later to make sure.@get2sammyb I thought that might be the, but thanks anyway! Gives me another reason for a replay at the end of the year on PS5 👍I won't be getting this game. There is a reason why Sony isn't letting reviewers talk about events in the game. Which is because it shows how Druckmann had to ruin the game by turning the characters you liked into petty vengeance seekers. And to retcon the characters you liked. As skill up said it's endlessly bleak with uninspired gameplay. Also we should not be rewarding Naughty Dog for their awful treatment of their employees. At this point more than likely ex employees. As another review said as well, we get it, and we are not this awful. Sorry Neil.it would have been awesome if this was the first AAAss title to feature actual sex scene. I want to see how grown up that girl is. I know there is a lesbian kissing scene, why couldnt they prolong it, send it all the way to bed? it would have made HISTORY! bah, this industry needs more people like me to put them on the pedestal of HISTORY.Does it have political **** in it ?I had it preordered until all the hubbub. If it's real I'll buy it used no money for ND. IF the game is indeed that good. So I'm a wait and see guy I guess. Kind of the same with Ghost will it upgrade to ps5? If not it's taking 60 bones outta my ps5 fund.I didnt like the first one so I wasnt getting it anyway. Im just glad I dont have to read 5 articles a day about it anymore. HopefullyPolygon review kinda told me what to look out for and not expect anything great. I'm still gonna be a dumba** and buy the game since I enjoyed the first one so much@Zach_99 you realize 90% of people who criticise the game was PlayStation users Right? Not everything is ""Xbox fanboys"" . This is why people dislike the PlayStation communityOutstanding ? Never. 7/10I'm going to wait for reviews from non mainstream media sites upon release, whilst I hope the scores are warranted I'm always suspect when it's so high across the board see Captain Marvel interference from Disney and considering the shady DMCA tactics used against YouTube creators/Amy Hennig being pushed out I'm not convinced of Naughty Dog being a good company anymore.For those purchasing it straight away I'm sure you'll love it, I'm just doing this for myself when spare funds are a luxury I don't really have.@TrueAssassin86x wait for user reviews...A great review! I have personally decided to stay away from the release reviews coming out on the day as I don’t want any further or embargo related details to spoil my first experience of it. I am so excited by this. Recently replayed the first and I’m hoping my Pro doesn’t make too much noise...if it does, that volume is getting cranked! CAN NOT WAIT!@playstation_kingFrom what I’ve read you probably don’t want your little brother around pal. It’s not for kids 😂@Exlee300p Yawn!@EnvyThen you'll ascertain that ""majority"" is still the every annoying and whiny minority that clearly are going into it not liking it and looking for any excuse to dislike it. I couldn't really care what platform the user has a bias for, though they do exist, the point is hoe layghably quick people are writing off the game for no reason, especially considering they haven't played it, despite reviews being positive and contrary to this bullshut narrative constructed about the game. Ultimatley, if you hate the game so much, why waste your efforts peddling your bias here? That's why people hate gamers and find it to he toxic. Keep your opinions and keep an open mind until you do actualy play the game. If you hate it then move on. Is that really hard to understand?@get2sammyb nice review, but one thing you didn't mention which I think deserves to be lauded is the vast array of accessibility options. I didn't know about them until I saw the ign review which pointed me at a PS blog post.Honestly, I am made up because I thought this game would be beyond me but now I've read about the text to speech, high contrast, large crosshairs/HUDs and other options you can enable this has now gone onto my must-have list.It's so unusual to find a developer that puts this much effort in, so I think it's important to give them respect where it's due.@mrgrieves The accessibility options are amazing. Didn't mention them in the review, but I wrote up an article about them here: https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2020/06/hands_on_the_last_of_us_2_may_be_the_most_accessible_action_game_ever_made@get2sammyb - ah fair play, I missed that. I'm just very eager for ND to get as much appreciation as possible in the hope that it might inspire others to do the same. Will read your other article now, and really glad that you've done your bit to highlight it - thanks.Great review, Sammy. Definitely looking forward to diving back into this world.@Skoda Bro... have you ever kissed a girl?@Zach_99 Wow I don't even know where to begin with such ignorance. First of all the embargo is over. And though it happens sometimes it is rare after the embargo is lifted for the company to say you can't talk about the all parts of the game. I am so sorry it offends you that people have different opinions then you. Your reaction is so over the top I thought you were a troll. You are definitely a caricature. I don't care that the game is violent. It's that they apparantly retconned the characters to make them lose all redeeming qualities with flashbacks. They made Elle so she never learns that violence isn't the only way to solve problems and that it has deep repercussions. Druckmann is basically saying everybody is scummy and irredeemable. Finally how naive can you be? Oh Naughty said it wasn't a terrible place to work at so it must be? 75% of the staff is gone that worked on the forst Last of Us. That's pretty telling. Jason Schrier also illuminated how crappy a place it is to work. I was planning to play it but Naughty Dog needs to change how they treat their employees. So I am not supporting this. People have other opinions than you. Get used to it and get over yourself!!@Kunfoostu Yawn, typical indifferent human being with no principles.You know nothing about me. The fact of the matter is we are that bad. Ive witnessed it first hand in Kosovo, Bosnia to name a few.... I’m currently watching the world be horrible to each over some awful police officer unintentionally/ unwittingly killing a career criminal who attacked pregnant women and broke into homes. Don’t pretend we are all so great, from where I’m looking there a lot a nasty people who will take what’s what they want. So quit your snivelling.@TooBarFoo Why does it matter?@get2sammyb How is the fan noise during play?@get2sammyb I absolutely love the first game and Is probably my favourite ever game, is there any mention in part 2 of previous characters, such as Henry, Sam, tess or bill at all? You probably won’t be able to mention but thought I’d ask? Please tell me I won’t be disappointed by part 2? 😉@Akurusu so why you come here?@LN78 Skill Up isn't a corporate shill afraid of having a real opinion and losing ad revenue. Every 10/10 and 100 review immediately lose all credibility.@Exlee300p I think you should play the game. You really don’t know what you’re talking about, I’m afraid.@__jamiie It’s noisy but I was honestly expecting worse. Maneater kicks my fans up louder than this. Your mileage may vary, of course.@3MonthBeef Not sure what you mean?@Kunfoostu I guess it's a matter of how you want to look at life. Glass half full or glass half empty. I'm not saying there are not bad people obviously that's naive. But just as obvious is that people doing bad things get more attention than people doing good things. And nobody is sniveling.@get2sammyb I assume you are talking about my assessment the game and not the stuff about Naughty Dog. Of course I'm willing to admit I'm wrong about what I've gleaned about the game. However my biggest reason for sitting this game out has more to do with how they have treated their employees. Several former devs have spoken about the conditions there so that is a known quantity. As well as how Naughty Dog used a third party to illegally strike down youtube creaters with false copyright strikes to silence any discussion of the leaks. Finally I find Neil Druckmann a rather rupulsive human being. But I do enjoy this site and generally find the reviews to be fair so who knows. Cheers Sammy!@Exlee300p my point is. One thing current events and history have taught us is we are more than capable of being like this. Most of life is nowhere near as bad as it is depicted in TLOU2 yet we have the capacity to do heinous things at will and we do. If life truly did become this cheap god help us all.What did you ever think the game was going to be like?It’s a sequel to a very violent game it was never gonna be very different was it? Only expanded upon. As for employee rights blah blah. Don’t be that person nobody and I mean nobody likes that person. We come here for the good banter and solid reviews. Next to nobody is interested whether Druckman recycles or buys fair trade coffee.Stop being a Karen x@Kunfoostu First of all you missed the point of what was talking about. The issue is not the subject matter but how it is relayed through the characters. Which is they don't learn and show everyone as irredeemable. As for the other points in your response all I can say is it is a typical pathetic response. First the arrogance to think you speak for the others on this site. Get over yourself dude. Secondly we do speak with our money and purchases. I'm sorry you don't appear to give crap about anything in the world other than being entertained. I understand crunch happens and am fine with it. But Naughty Dog is egregious in this regard and many others. They are over the top terrible to their employees. The other thing is how they abused the copyright strike system on youtube creators to illegally silence any disussions of the leaks. Many smaller channels were shutdown fir several weeks as a result. Finally they used a version of a song in their advertising that did not give credit to the artist. It was only after she spoke up that they acknowledged what they'd done. Furthermore Druckmann is a self important pompous ass and it would be nice to have new leadership there. Calling me a Karen is just pathetic on your part. The aggrrieved erstwhile devs from Naughty Dog said if a game did worse than expected it might change things there.@TrueAssassin86x Just don`t preorder it.@get2sammyb hi Sammy, do you know if we will be able to buy the score to the game? Can’t wait to hear more of Gustavo santaolalla’s great music in the second game! Is it Friday yet 😉I think your missing life. Ellie was living for the first time in a long time, happy, maybe found love etc etc. When all that gets taken away from you and your just surviving...surviving isn’t living. Full of hate you really care about much anymore, not your own life and certainly not some random scum bags. If someone did the things that happen to Ellie to me for example when the world had gone to crap...I’d respond very similar or die trying. Fck Id probably do you in just for being an oxygen thief in that situation and being another burden and mouth to feed. 😘 nah in all honesty someone else would of probably done you in or more than likely you’d of got yourself killed trying to convince a clicker it’s not too late to change and be friends. LolzAgain your the one presuming and forcing your views on peeps. I come here to see what Sammy thought of the game and if Naughty Dog have done a good job. End off!Go chain yourself to Naughty Dogs headquarters railings or write a letter to your local MP and convince yourself your making a difference. Please though kindly stfu about it.My grandad always told me only an idiot agues with and idiot. So I’ll leave you to it.@get2sammyb Thanks sammy, I'm all about the ending and the difficulty. Oh well, need to go play the prequel DLC now, I know I have it downloaded somewhere.BuT SkILlUp SaYs ThE gaMe sUcKs, sO It MusT sUck beCauSe aLL poSitiVe ReviEws gOt pAId anD He iS tHe OnlY HonEst ReviEwer.Right now quite a lot of people seem to believe the reviewers were all paid to give a good review. And nobody is honest. Its just ridiculous and I bet the game will be unnecessarily review-bombed by a lot of morons.
I was skeptical at first and wanted to wait for reviews. Reviews are here and are amazing. Plus some other quite normal youtube content creators who got an early copy and played the game (plus absolutely loved the first one) were also blown away.I pre-ordered and am hoping it will be a devastatingly emotional journey that will have my wife question who in the world could hurt her man so much he just lies on the floor crying all weekend. I am ready to be emotionally ripped into shreds.Thanks for the vote of confidence with the sequel! I look forward to playing it in 1-2 years when it's on sale for $10-$20 New frequently.@TrueAssassin86x Just don`t be disapointed... How can a game that has received so much backlash, with some reviewers even going as far as saying that the story itself was 'bleak' receive a 10/10?Before anyone tells me to go and play the game. How can a review be impartial when it was indirectly pre-announced that this game would have been a 10?Where is the non-bias?To make it clear, i am a huge fan of the series, pt2 has been on pre-order since 2018.Meh, Uncharted was good until the cinematic pieces got too long and the narrative annoying - the start and ending of Uncharted 4 are cringe worthy. I prefer games to be wanton escapism, the satire in the GTA games is amusing, Naughty Boy have disappeared up their own rear ends with their ""on message"" kitchen sink dramas.Im curious to see how the ""new direction"" and over-the-top torture porn-style violence will go down with the ""common audience"". This will be grounds for discussion for months to come.@Zach_99 Sorry but you have no idea what you're talking about. People were (and are) up in arms because they loved TLOU and TLOU II seems, according to the leaks, to disrespect what made TLOU special in every possible way. This was the outrage. Not that people have a general problem with same-sex relationships or similar themes. If you enjoyed TLOU too, for the special bond between Ellie and Joel and the narrative as a whole, you might as well be disappointed about what's coming for you and it doesn't make you a bigot then. But if you enjoy it, fine, I'm glad for you. Honestly. But for me, treasuring the first game in my heart, it was such a disappointment seeing the simple story (violence begets violence), convoluted narrative (out-of-order-flashbacks), the torture-porn level of brutality (I get it, it's postapocalyptic, but in this game it's really over the top, yes maybe I'm squeamish), the lack of choice in how things play out and the utter gut-wrenching scenes I saw (luckily) in the spoilers made me avoid this, even though I waited for it, like everyone else, for years.Sincerly hope it lives up to your expectations man.@TrueAssassin86x Thank you for that info. Unfortunately i’ve preordered a physical copy! 🤭I can't wait to play the Schindler's List of gaming lol! On a serious note, I am looking forward to diving into it this weekend and seeing if it lives up to the hype.I thought I could come up with excuses to buy this later but who was I kidding? There's no saying NO to ND or R* when they come knocking. Pre-ordered off the PS Store, looking forward to playing tonight! Woooooooo!The series x lot are at it over on N4G. Native 4K this and that. They are so 4K head strong they forget this console generations most gorgeous, detailed looking graphical game is releasing tomorrow on PlayStation and is 1440P on PS4 Pro. Once you start going above 1080P there are many factors, screen size, viewing distance and top end 4K TV up scaling and other wizardry10/10.
So that means the game is completely flawless and perfect? No complaints or issues what so ever? For a cinematic type game that’s really fishy to me. Honestly I have not heard one super positive thing from the people playing it on stream.
Also, sex scene in this game is fine, but suggestive anime bikini is a no-no from Sony.@Arugula The first is one of my favourites of all time and I knew this was a MUST but yet still I was just trying to look for some excuse to save £55 😆 But then I realized I pre-ordered average FIFA 20 for £60 so it would be a great insult and disrespect to one of my favourite devs - ND - if I didn't preorder this.@suikoden I thought the Ign japan review was excellent. How was it nitpicking?Put 2 hours in so far and its fantastic, won't say any more then that but yeah its pretty great.@WallyWest Some people are saying the choices the characters make are nonsensical from watching the cutscenes that got released.Only an hour in and I'm at a loss for words but I'll try...holyCashmoleyness! The emotions, the details in the environments, the guitar background, those character models. I feel like I'm getting a preview into PS5.I have watched 3 hours of the game so far and I am glad about it. I will watch the rest in YouTube as I care only how it ends but the story so far is very bad.Nothing compared to the first one. The main characters are done so badly that I do not even care what happens to them after the 2nd hour (SPOILER: IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN).The Last of Us 1 is still superior game. Graphics does not mean anything if you can't back it up.Put in 2 hours and here are my early impressions: graphics are great, but RDR2 is still prettier. Animation is top notch, as per usual with Naughty Dog. Overall I feel it's going to be one of the best games I've ever played. One serious gripe: the PRO is LOUD when playing this game. Like vacuum cleaner loud. I can hear it with my headphones on... Not even RDR2 or GOW managed that. I'm going to replay it on PS5 asap to get the most pleasure out of the game because I'm really fed up with this nonsense.@LN78 Thank you.I wonder what the user reviews will be like.@LN78 I will see it through the end but it is pretty gutting.@Zuljaras I know the moment you mean as i'm five hours into it and i can say your comments makes zero sense really regarding what happens, TLoU characters are still completely in character and the new characters are just that new characters. Of course a lot of character interaction and backstory is explored by playing the game and not by watching cutscenes, a section i just done had tons of optional dialogue and the some cutscenes easily missed if you just watch cutscenes, this optional stuff (what anyone whose playing will see because the need to explore will happen) deepens characters and bonds so yeah if you're just cutscenes then your opinion is as good as invalid because you missed a ton of context and character development. Also the gameplay is fantastic so even if i don't like the story in the end (so far i'm enjoying it) at the very i can say the gameplay was fantastic.@Zuljaras The user scores will be low because a bunch of manbabies who haven't even played it will score it 0/10. This is going to be metabombed hard sadly, anyway pre-orders have surpassed SM so its going to make a ton of money either way.I've been shaking my head in disbelief at the gorgeousness of the graphics art style from the beginning. RDRII's sibling has arrived!After having seen a friend play it, read a whole bunch of non-0 user reviews on metacritic and watched lots of reaction videos on youtube I wonder how you can give this game a 10/10 and not even mention that what made the first game great is completely absent. Meaning the bond between Joel and Ellie, delicate narrative and a solid multiplayer. The game itself is a slight upgrade in gameplay mechanics and graphics, the sound is stellar as usual but besides thet the story is not only bleak torture porn, but also a disgrace to everyone who enjoyed the first game for that special bond between Ellie and Joel to the point where I and my friend where asking ourselves if Druckman went batshit Crazy. Even if you play the diversity card, this does nothing for diversity. It's stupid violence all over, telling the oldest story of them all that was already boring in the bible: violence begets violence, unless you break the circle. Fine. Ellie does. But at the cost of the player's closure. I feel like if you value what TLOU 1 was, and this is the reason why they even have so many pre-orders in the first place, this game is a 3/10, because it's a blatant insult to everyone who loved the first game for that fatherly, magic bond with Ellie and their development (Ellie hardening, Joel softening up, in the end meeting each other halfway). Also the ultra-violence is off-putting. The whole game feels like a kick in the stomach. Yes you will feel hatred and anger. Yes that's what Druckman wanted but honestly, in my opinion, he can shove it, without spit even. For everyone enjoying a moody, decent action game with ultra-violence without much care for its characters or the first game, it might still be a 7 or 8/10.But a 10/10 on so many review sites, with no word about the blatant break in narrative and the disrespect for the characters that made the franchise what it was in the first place, that's just pathetic. Oh, and what went on with copyright-striking all those youtubers through a strawman lawfirm in INDIA because they were not even showing footage of the leaks just discussing that they didn't like what they saw is abysmal business practice. I've had enough of those righteaous developers and godlike figures so full of themselves they can't even hear themselves fart anymore like Druckman. Awful highschool-like writing, zero character development beyond the obvious, unneccessary torture porn, uneasy and unfullfilling to the end.MY opinion. Not a hater.
Everyone who bought it, enjoy it, it's what you deserve.If they'd made an anime game about tits and ass all the upset people would be happy and whine about censorship if no one bought it.Shoes on the other foot now guys.Damn I had to ignore Scollurio, it’s like he is driving his own agenda of talking trash about this game.I expect to finish the game tomorrow, then let’s see. So far I have not come across any plot holes. No TLoU1 character was disrespected so far, no narrative broken. I absolutely loved the first game and think this game goes deeper into the complex relation between Joel and Ellie and I completely enjoy that part of it.@WallyWest Manbabies? That's a bit childish no? People have every right like it or not to like it.@CamLondon When they're metabombing it without even playing the game yes they are. Its fine to it and not like it but most of the haters made they're mind up weeks with a out of context leak or a couple of years back when Ellie kissed Deena.@Scollurio You can have that opinion doesn't mean its not flawed or right, yeah you can read user reviews and reaction reviews but we all know you handpicked the ones what fuel your opinion.Looks like many critics ate at the Naughty Dog Restaurant and loved the whole experience.
Someone posted a video about just one of the many dishes and those who have never eaten at that restaurant think it's ok to say that the restaurant should burn only because the menu is different from what they expected.
And they don't want to try the new menu to realize while the critics loved it...@WallyWest What an ignorant assumption. Don't judge others by your own behaviour dude. I tried hard to like it and was actually looking for redeeming qualities, story- and narrative-wise. Unfortunately MY wait for this sequel was in vain.My ps4pro just took over 2 hours to copy from the boot disk I mean WTF?.......anyone else had this problem?@WallyWest You can't prove that. Just like you can't prove that the developers didn't say ""Hey Push Square review our game fairly (😉💵) and we'll make sure you'll get early access to our next game"".@WallyWest Just like you did though no?@OGGamer You see i'm friends with someone whose a pro reviewer for another website and they got a early review copy and gave it 10/10 and yeah i know for a fact their opinion comes from them and not Sony.Tell me if Cyberpunk gets 10/10 everywhere will you accuse CDPR of buying reviews? Nah you won't because you don't hate that game like you must do TLoUP2, it got 10/10 from a lot of reviewers because that's what they feel it deserves.@Scollurio My opinion comes from playing the game, yours comes from watching bias Youtubers and bias user reviews who haven't played the game. Its not ignorance its knowing exactly how people like you work especially going by your wall of rant.@WallyWest I didn't rant, only stating that I'm disappointed because the trailers and the leadup made me believe the game is more in the vein of the first one. Also I stated multiple times that I watched a friend play for hours and watched gameplay segments and cutscenes (without bias or commentary) on Youtube.""People like you!"" - you don't know me, don't draw assumptions, please.How much was PushSquare paid for this review? The worst sequel that has ever been made. From the laughable plot, repetitive gameplay to the SJW LBGTQ agenda, it's been a complete disaster. What a shame@Scollurio Ok fair enough, right now its just hard to tell between the people who have legit faults and those what are just trolling or hating for the sake of it.@Al_ The gameplay is pretty much the same as the first but expanded and improved, if you like how the first game plays then there's zero reason you would feel different to this. Ahh though Ellie is a lesbian and has a relationship with a girl so yes its pushing an ""agenda"" and you can't deal with that, you know the game largely just just treats them as two young adults in love, irony is you most likely love lesbian porn though but i guess that's different right?I got my copy today and I’ve just played about two hours after work and all I can say is wow, this game is incredible! And all I can say to the people who haven’t played it or are judging it on the leaks or whatever you have heard online, nothing compares to playing it, it really doesn’t!@WallyWest I get this. No worries! well, 10 in 10 is really strong.. I hope I don't get another DeathStranding disapointment.. I love most of your reviews (not so much your ratings, but..), am giving you guys another chance..Devs tried too hard to make a complicated story and cast of characters that they completely messed up the direction which the game should've taken. the game was a very disappointing experience for me considering i waited 5 years for LoUs2.https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/the-last-of-us-part-ii?ref=hpDon't want to tell all of you ""told you so"", but I did tell you that this is exactly how it was gonna happen. What a way to kill the franchise...Have to say it's a technical masterpiece, but as soon as Abby turns up it went down hill for me just such a nasty and unlikable character , I understand she's upset and we should feel a little sympathy for her but she is so badly writing and unlikable i just don't care, worst of all seems you a forced to play around 50% of the game as her, so because of her it's a 6.5/10 if I weren't forced to play her i could forgive the poor writing a little and would rate it a 9/10@Gamakazil ""kill the franchise""? Hahahaha.Good one. The franchise will be more than fine.@Philbear82 haven't you heard? Plenty of guys are certain that watching it on Youtube is the same. Comment sections are all the comedy I need in my life.Are You Afraid of people leave Your Website? The Game is far from 10. Overall a Whatever Sequel.@WallyWest Having two lesbians isn't bothering anyone. What bothers people is their characters are poorly written and the game has a clear political agenda that is nothing to do Abby & Ellie being lesbians.@naruball yeah, as much as Mass Effect is doing fine at the moment hahahaPeople fawn over this title. Personally, I don't see what all the hype is about, unless you're just factoring in graphics. Sure the narrative and storytelling is pretty good, but it's just another zombie survival game thats been done 1,000 times over.Whilst I wouldn't say it's a bad game, 10/10 is (in my humble opinion) an absurb scoring. Not to mention giving any game 10/10 is absurd, as if it has any flaws, it's can't be perfect, can it? I appreciate peoples excitement for a game, and the fact they may love it to pieces, but try to give an objective view, especially if you're a critic, reviewer or editor of any sort.@Gamakazil super accurate comparison considering how well Andromeda sold. Hahaha.A few fair questions for the author of this review: do you receive any endorsements from gaming studios or have any conflict of interests to declare? Did you write this review after playing the same game that was released or did you just watch the trailer? I can't reconcile what you wrote with the game I just finished playing. Its beyond personal opinion or taste. There are claims you make which I see as factually incorrect. For instance praising the graphics. How is that relevant when the player spends 95% of the game stumbling through shockingly bad lighting. With a flashlight which is supposed to provide light but somehow doesn't. The game is not deep. Or challenging morally. Its crude and lacks depth or nuance in the places where it matters. The characters are unlikable. The player doesn't care whether they succeed or fail. Saving a character is irrelevant since they die anyway. The game is long. Too long. The gameplay is not innovative (copy-paste of ""TLoU part 1"").The game claims to challenge the player's perception of right and wrong. But instead it gives into crude voyeurism and a grotesque obsession with torture. For no reason. It lacks depth, balance or nuance. It only showcases the worst in humanity. Without any contrast or subtlety. The LGBTQ+ characters are, let's face it, almost insulting caricatures.Shocking is not a sign of depth. I feel about the last of us part 2 like I feel about something moldy and furry you'd find in your fridge. I am not shocked by it. I am not challenged by it. I am not made any wiser by it. I am just disgusted by it and I want it gone. There isn't any message to take home either. Will this game leave a long term mark on me? Did it change or teach anything? No. Its going straight in the bin. Naughty Dog took what should have a homerun and managed an epic fail.I am a massive fan of the first game and it pains me to write this. But anything other than what I wrote would have been a lie.I absolutely loved the first game, but the second game was sodisappointing. If its a nr 3 im not gonna spend money on it.I am still annoyed by the poor plot.@get2sammyb idk how you could have completely left Abby our of your review. Given that you play half the game as her this strikes me as odd@get2sammyb just finished it.

The Last of Us Part II,John-Paul Jones,PlayStation Universe,https://www.psu.com/reviews/the-last-of-us-part-2-review/," John-Paul Jones / June 12, 2020The Last of Us Part 2 Review – As the monochrome credits and hallmark melancholy strings faded out for The Last of Us Part 2, it took some time for me to gather myself. Left in some manner of stunned silence, normally most credit sequences are duly turned off as my attention shifts to something else, but with The Last of Us Part 2 however, such respite was desperately needed. My DualShock 4 had, for the better part of a week, acted akin to an umbilical cord that had tethered me to one of the most memorable gaming experiences of my entire life. Without that connection, my mind now needed to effectively buffer everything that just had happened.The first and most immediate reaction that rushed to the front of my mind is that Naughty Dog have done it again. Despite the intimidatingly long shadow cast by the first game, The Last of Us Part 2 not only replicates the feat of its predecessor by arguably cementing itself as the game of a generation as we all prepare ourselves to take the first steps into the next, but it also definitively makes a case for itself as one of the most stellar and most memorable action adventures you will ever play. The Last of Us Part 2 is thoroughly emblematic of the notion of a high quality PlayStation exclusive.This is why more than 110 million people own a PlayStation 4.Editor’s Note: There is SO much that we want to tell you about The Last of Us Part 2 but are presently unable to due to a range of very specific (but understandable) embargo restrictions. This review represents the tip of what is a very large and mostly unknown iceberg. Those of you who go into this game completely blank will be thoroughly rewarded, while those of you who have fallen prey to spoilers still will not have seen the gargantuan shocks, twists and surprises that Naughty Dog’s latest has to offer. The joy is in the execution – and we can’t wait for you to discover and experience all of it for yourself!Taking place after the events of the previous game, The Last of Us Part 2 practically demands that you possess some level of familiarity with Naughty Dog’s previous excursion into the grim, hope crushed world that captivated millions of gamers back in 2013. Thematically speaking, if the Uncharted franchise was seemingly devil may care about the vast amounts of casual murder and carnage that its seemingly ‘good’ protagonists wrought on their foes, The Last of Us Part 2 absolutely swings violently in the other direction.Every act of violence is shocking, bloody and rendered with the sort of razor sharp attention to detail that it appears Naughty Dog have miraculously brought the next console generation kicking and screaming to gamers a good six months early, but I’m getting ahead of myself here. Without delving deeply into spoiler territory, the overriding theme of The Last of Us Part 2 is one of consequence. Everyone matters. Everyone has friends and family that love them. Everything is felt and in turn, so too does the player feel every bit of the suffering, pain and fury in a way that only the enabling agency of a video game could properly accommodate.This theme provides a narrative through-line that begins with the opening act, too. With the traumatic events of the first game now behind them, Joel and Ellie together with Joel’s brother Tommy, now live something of a routine and content life in the Jackson city stronghold – a flourishing bastion for humanity where kids play in the snow, toddlers take their first tentative steps in a secure nursery steeped in the wild, painterly brushstrokes of the young adorn the walls and folks of all creeds pull together to create that rarest of commodities – hope. It is by no exaggeration, a world away from the grim, omnipresent savagery that lurks outside its tall, impenetrable walls.Despite such uneasy portent, it still comes as something of a savage shock when Ellie’s world comes crashing down around her. Untethered from many of the support systems that have given her direction in an otherwise directionless world, Ellie finds herself on a furious, soul-shattering journey to track down those responsible for tearing her so violently from a life she was just getting comfortable with.Structurally, The Last of Us was largely predicated around the notion of a post apocalyptic American road-trip with Joel and Ellie which took them across the country and through all the seasons of the year. In The Last of Us Part 2, that same basic structure mostly returns, but the cast of characters is much larger this time. Once more, it is impossible to discuss this in any sort of real detail without veering into spoilers, but Naughty Dog have wrought some tremendous work here, fashioning a brave narrative that takes some real, high-stakes risks with the characters and settings that are encompassed within the game.Indeed, the biggest credit that I can give to Naughty Dog is that they take *so* many storytelling gambles early on that you’re not entirely sure how they’ll pay off and yet, by the time the end credits occur, such fears find themselves absolutely unfounded. Make no mistake, The Last of Us Part 2 is a masterclass in audience manipulation – making your murderous pursuits feel totally justified one minute and then absolutely shaking your beliefs in previously established characters and their motives in the next.And this is all the while the game makes ample use of time and geography skips to introduce new characters and flesh out their backstories. Trust me, you will be shaken once all is said and done. Beyond the characters that inhabit the setting that Naughty Dog have painstakingly created, so too does the world building of The Last of Us 2 impress on the regular.From the destroyed beauty of Seattle’s concrete cityscape where long discarded cars have been bound to the mud and grass like prisoners, to the snow-blotted, frost-bitten hillsides of Jackson, Naughty Dog have given themselves a much wider lens with which to frame the lasting effect that the outbreak has had on humanity while showcasing the ever-encroaching spectacle of Mother Nature as she slowly takes back her domain. Simply put, the world that The Last of Us Part 2 has fashioned around its cast is every bit as evocative as the characters themselves and it’s a place which despite its grim trappings, is somewhere you’ll never want to leave.Part of what makes the setting of The Last of Us Part 2 such a joy to explore is the newly refined traversal possibilities afforded to the player, in so far as the younger Ellie can interact with the game world in ways that Joel couldn’t. Just about any window can be shattered with a beautifully palpable strike and hopped through, while a new crawl ability lets her access the sort of hard to reach areas that Joel and his knobbly, old-man knees would not be able to.Whether it’s breaking into a full spirited sprint, navigating a series of jumps smoothly, swinging and leaping off of various ropes and cables and much more besides, Ellie simply feels like a much more agile and responsive protagonist than Joel ever did. You’re given much more opportunity to indulge in this sort of exploration too, as The Last of Us Part 2 features much larger areas and a series of open world expanses which clearly show some inherited design DNA from Naughty Dog’s previous effort, Uncharted: The Lost Legacy.While these larger open spaces that serve to connect the traditionally smaller and more linear corridors of action that Naughty Dog games typically possess as their hallmark, exploring them never feels like a chore. Certainly, for those eager folk who just wish to press on through to the next point in the story they can do just that, but fully exploring these larger areas quickly reveals itself to be a more than worthwhile endeavour.In addition to the loot rewards and collectibles that you typically receive, the various nooks and crannies of these areas often contain additional story and character exposition which when taken in tandem with the freedom to explore, fleshes out the world of The Last of Us Part 2 yet further still. In one example, Ellie wanders into a bank vault to discover a dunderheaded heist that was done on Outbreak Day but which, predictably, goes hilariously wrong thanks to the extremely angry note left behind by one of the robbers who was double-crossed and subsequently sealed inside the vault.There are countless areas like this in the game too and put simply, the incentive to milk every last drop out of the stunningly detailed world that Naughty Dog has crafted here is extraordinarily compelling to say the least. Handily, Naughty Dog has applied some finesse to this exploration too, as once an area has been fully looted and explored, Ellie will make a statement to that effect, preventing the player from wasting time in an area that has been picked clean of goodies.Speaking of goodies, the upgrade system in The Last of Us Part 2 reveals itself to be both familiar and a little different from what we’ve seen previously. While tool components and a bench are both still required to upgrade the damage, stability and accuracy of your firearms, there is no longer a toolset gating mechanism in place – meaning that if you have the number of components early on, there’s nothing stopping you from fully upgrading your weapons as soon as you see fit. Where things are a little different this time round is in the manner in which Ellie unlocks new abilities.While the chems return from the previous game, once more acting as a surrogate for traditional experience point progression, they’ve now been funnelled into a wider range of skill trees. With a much broader array of different disciplines to pile these points into, players can now opt to customise their play style a little more thoroughly, with skill tress that focus on faster crafting, improved stealth and more besides. It’s hardly groundbreaking stuff, but the additional latitude to specialize is still very welcome all the same.What is groundbreaking however, is how combat is handled in The Last of Us 2 and specifically the massive improvements that Naughty Dog have made in every aspect of its design. Pointedly, the most immediately recognisable improvements that Naughty Dog have made to the combat side of things is the manner in which melee combat deals with strikes, momentum and evasion.This time round, though the window for evading incoming strikes is a little more explicit and easier to read than it was in the first game, the attack patterns of the various enemies you’ll face off with are also more sophisticated and unpredictable too in order to keep things interesting. Additionally, once you do a land a strike and follow it up with a combination of further blows, your momentum can be interrupted by the enemy – with the opposite being true also. The end result of this subtle reworking then, is that The Last of Us Part 2’s more intimate battles boast a sort of ebb and flow that just wasn’t really there in the first game.Happily, I can also report that the creative latitude of the previous game for deciding how you wish to take on each situation, whether through stealth, outright confrontation or a mixture of running and gunning also returns in The Last of Us Part 2. Now enhanced, the areas in which such conflicts unfurl is large enough that should things go south, you can always sprint away from your enemies and find relative safety – ‘relative’ being the operative word given that the attack dogs which the human enemies use can sniff you out from a much longer distance.Further afield, the much improved battlefield AI for both friendly and enemy entities proves to be quite the highlight also. The numerous AI partners that Ellie finds herself paired up with throughout the duration of the game are all much more free-thinking and capable than before, intelligently targeting and prioritising enemies that are attempting to outflank you while being practised hands (for the most part) at melee and ranged combat. Enemies on the other hand, will audibly call out your position to their allies in an effort to flank you and flush you out of cover, while other foes will use sophisticated non-spoken commands to get the edge during battle.Tying directly in to The Last of Us Part 2’s overt themes of connection and loss is that when you kill a human enemy, one of their friends will yell out the name of the newly fallen in anguish and in some situations, foolishly rush toward you in a blind rage. More than just a gameplay wrinkle, this really rams home that theme of consequence – that every enemy you kill was potentially someone’s brother, sister, son, daughter, father or mother and that in ending their life, you’ve grievously destroyed the emotional wellbeing of a friend or loved one.Arguably, one of the most impressive aspects of the combat in The Last of Us Part 2 is the sound engineering. Previously, I had thought that Battlefield developer EA DICE had a monopoly on this, but with The Last of Us Part 2, things have changed. Oh boy have they ever changed. Whether it’s the sound of a plank wood smashing a clicker upside the head with a sickening squelch, the ear-rattling sound of a handgun firing its lethal payload into the soft flesh of a human foe or the deafening roar of a shotgun pretty much blowing someone in half, the violence in The Last of Us Part 2 is as much an audible spectacle as it is a visual one.Visually speaking, The Last of Us Part 2 sits at the apex of what Sony’s current generation console is capable of. With an up close look of the dirt long since stuck under the fingernails of Joel’s hand during the game’s guitar strumming opening, to watching him raise a hand up to shield his eyes from the blazing sunlight as he gently rides his charger up a hill abundant with all manner of flourishing flora, The Last of Us Part 2 cements itself as an eye opening treat to say the least.It’s no exaggeration to say that The Last of Us Part 2 excels in every aspect of its visual presentation, but it’s truly in the full body character and facial animation that Naughty Dog has managed to outdo itself. There’s a feeling that, nearly twenty years after the release of the PlayStation 2, The Last of Us Part 2 finally represents the pie-in-the-sky dream that Sony had with its much touted ‘Emotion Engine’ back in the year 2000, creating thoroughly emotive characters aided by some of the best facial animations ever seen in any game – a fact that Naughty Dog’s superb cinematography never fails to showcase. From almost perfectly lip-synced voice acting to facial animations that do a grand job of emulating every twitch, facial crease and emotive reaction, (and hair that actually looks like and moves like hair!) The Last of Us Part 2 manages that feat which so few other titles do in being able to suspend believability in the characters and by proxy, the excellent, verve-steeped performances of the acting talent that has provided them with in both voice and motion.It speaks to the confidence of Naughty Dog that all the cutscenes are now rendered in real-time, eschewing the pre-rendered video approach that the developer took in the first game and providing The Last of Us Part 2 with a seamless transition between gameplay and cinematic events. Such confidence is absolutely warranted on a technical level too, as everything from the animation, lighting and shadow effects through to the sheer and ridiculously detailed textures is utterly top-tier. Honestly, it boggles the mind that the console The Last of Us Part 2 was designed for barely scrapes two teraflops. See? Teraflops. They matter far less than people think.Further beyond such obvious visual marvels, The Last of Us Part 2 is also generously awash with all manner micro flourishes that can pass in a blink of an eye as well. From a cheeky squirrel that cuts across a grassy path with a partially cracked nut in its mouth, to a wayward plastic bag lazily bobbing up high in the wind, The Last of Us Part 2’s visual caliber fully services the gorgeous world that underpins it in ways that cannot be appreciated on a single playthrough.A shoutout must absolutely go to the musical score too. Evoking comparisons with the sort of moody and minimalist music that silver screen composer Jóhann Jóhannsson brought to such Hollywood movies as Denis Villeneuve Sicario, the soundtrack is thoroughly on point throughout, deftly oscillating between softer strings for the quieter, more reflective moments to the creeping dread of The Last of Us Part 2’s most tense scenes. The Last of Us Part 2 is quite simply an audiovisual marvel.Something else that needs to be made clear here too, is that The Last of Us Part 2 might just be one of the most violent games available right now. Aided by the excellent animation, the look of anger on Ellie’s as she struggles to rip through the throat of an enemy with her trusty knife is at once hugely disturbing and also massively impressive.To be clear, this isn’t the sort over the top violence that one might equate with something like DOOM Eternal, instead this is the sort of eerily nasty, thoughtful savagery that could be believably perpetrated by one human being to another, and which is in turn robustly supported by the performances of the characters and creatures that exist in the world of The Last of Us Part 2.If indeed the rumors are true and The Last of Us Part 2 proves to be swansong of its director, than neither he nor the more than 110 million PlayStation 4 owners across the globe could ask for a better way to see this generation into the twilight. Clocking in at 30 hours for a single playthrough, it might be cliché, but The Last of Us Part 2 really is a bigger, better and more brutal game than its illustrious predecessor ever was.A frequently disturbing, often unsettling but always breathtaking odyssey, The Last of Us Part 2 is heart-stoppingly essential and effortlessly cements itself as the best game on PlayStation 4. “Have Naughty Dog managed another Game of the Generation” I hear you say? You betcha.Review code kindly provided by Sony.The Last of Us Part 2 releases exclusively for PlayStation 4 on June 19, 2020.The Last of Us Part 2 is a frankly incredible achievement. Intertwining deep, richly written characters, cementing themes of consequence and loss all the while widening a world that was so well established in the first game, Naughty Dog have crafted one of the finest action adventures of all time and one that invariably stands as the most opulent jewel in an already glittering crown of first-party PlayStation 4 exclusives. A rip-roaring and emotional masterpiece that will be talked about for years to come, *this* is why more than 110 million people own a PlayStation 4.

The Last of Us Part II,Christopher Byrd,Washington Post,https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/reviews/last-us-part-ii-one-best-video-games-ever-made/,"This article was published more than 2 years agoThe Last of Us Part IIDeveloped by: Naughty DogPublished by: Sony Interactive EntertainmentAvailable on: PlayStation 4“The Last of Us Part II” is an astonishing achievement — a searing demonstration of how a video game can marry heart-stopping gameplay, gorgeous environmental storytelling and anxiety-inducing moral complexity. Though it uses the tropes of the zombie apocalypse, it completely transcends the genre. “The Last of Us Part II” is not a game about zombies. It’s a meditation on loss — not simply loss of life, but of community, family, and individual capabilities — and the effort it takes to muddle through maddening grief.“The Last of Us” (2013) told the story of Joel and Ellie. Joel is a middle-aged smuggler hired to transport Ellie, a young teenager, across the country. They head out West to meet up with the Fireflies, a hard-pressed group of survivors living in the shadow of a collapsed society who hope to use Ellie to synthesize a vaccine to counter the plague that has turned most of the human population into flesh-chomping monstrosities. As it stands, Ellie is the only known person to have survived being bitten by “the infected.” From the beginning Joel tries to remain unattached to her to ward himself from potential suffering. But eventually he comes to love Ellie as a daughter. After delivering her to the Fireflies, he is emotionally undone to discover that she will have to forfeit her life for the manufacture of a vaccine. Though Ellie is fully prepared to sacrifice herself for the good of humanity, Joel ignores her wishes and forcibly removes her from the medical facility while she is under anesthesia, then lies to her about the incident.A child in a dangerous world: Inside the creation of EllieThe episode at the hospital is repeatedly revisited and examined from different angles in “The Last of Us Part II,” which picks up a few years later with Joel and Ellie living among a small community of people in Wyoming. In the intervening time, a rift has opened up between them as Ellie has come to be more self-reliant.Due to the incredibly restrictive nature of the embargo agreement, there is much about the plot, the characters, and the overall structure of “The Last of Us Part II” that I can’t discuss. What I can say is that after weathering a harrowing loss, Ellie travels out to Seattle to settle a vendetta. Her journey is one of the bloodiest treks in video game history. (I can’t think of another game that makes, say, the amputation of a limb a longed-for best-case scenario.) Although many packs of zombies lie between Ellie and her goal, it’s the violence orchestrated by humans against other humans that lingers in the mind.When Ellie kills someone, they rarely go meekly into the gentle night. Unless she performs a “silent takedown,” i.e. sneaking up on someone and slitting their throat, her victims will often spend their remaining seconds pleading for their lives, wailing, or calling to their loved ones. The developers go to tremendous lengths to humanize many of Ellie’s adversaries. Indeed, the towering achievement of “The Last of Us Part II” is that it’s constructed in such a way that by the end I wanted nothing more than for Ellie to renounce killing because of the psychological harm it was inflicting on her and those around her. How gloriously paradoxical is it that one of the finest action games ever made pushes things to such an extreme that I wanted to reject its central game mechanics? At certain points during the second half of the story I found myself reluctant to press the buttons that would lead to injury of another character. Talk about a mind trip.What makes this level of violence bearable are the sections of downtime generously spread throughout the campaign. Watching Ellie and Joel stroll through a museum, for example, is as interesting as any of the action sequences. So expressive are their words and their looks. The developers at Naugthy Dog have a flair for narrative pacing. Characters are treated to moments of aesthetic exultation — times when they lose themselves in the beauty of a scene or the company of another. This technique makes them that much more endearing, that much more soulful.As I moved from one extraordinarily rendered environment to the next — simply coming across a light source in a room can be diverting — the staggering amount of detail on display everywhere made me mull over the human cost that goes into making something on the scale of “The Last of Us Part II.” In an industry notorious for asking employees to keep long hours, the perfectionist culture at Naughty Dog still stands out. An article in Kotaku by Jason Schreier describes the onerous labor conditions around the project. In it, he quotes a developer for “The Last of Us Part II”: “This can’t be something that’s continuing over and over for each game, because it is unsustainable,” the developer said. “At a certain point you realize, ‘I can’t keep doing this. I’m getting older. I can’t stay and work all night.’ ” (Notably, Schreier reported on the perfectionist culture at Rockstar Games whose “Red Dead Redemption 2” is one of the only games that can compete with “The Last of Us Part II” on a visual level.) It’s for that reason that I could not help but read into this letter which Ellie finds in her travels:“The Last of Us Part II” is one of the best video games I’ve ever played; I hope the cost to the developers was worth it.Christopher Byrd is a Brooklyn-based writer.

The Last of Us Part II,Lisa Marie Segarra,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/game-reviews/the-last-of-us-part-2-review/?itm_medium=bf20disc,"Releasing a follow-up to a deeply beloved game is daunting and can easily leave fans disappointed. The Last of Us Part II pulls the feat off effortlessly.This sequel expands on what was already a well-crafted story and perfects it. It does the first release justice, expanding on the original without straying too far, which could alienate fans hoping to get a taste of what they loved the first time around. If you haven’t experienced the original check it out at the link below.
The Last of Us weighs heavily on this entry, as the ramifications of Joel’s actions have sprawling effects, and history does not go unforgotten. Ellie and Joel have made a new life in Jackson, Wyoming, but the game lets players know that moving on isn’t so simple.
The plot is certainly dark, but it never feels edgy. There’s a sense of empathy even for your enemies. Obviously, the game packs plenty of unexpected twists that make The Last of Us Part II feel emotionally and narratively polished. There are Easter eggs and quippy jokes, but this is a revenge story. That is never forgotten.
Emotional impact
The Last of Us was lauded for its emotional narrative that left players reeling, and Naughty Dog’s sequel finds a way to expand on that. The Last of Us Part II is a gut punch in the best way.

I can’t count the number of times I stared wide-eyed at the screen, thinking, “No. That can’t be right. That can’t be how this goes.”

Players of the first game already know and love Ellie, so it’s easy to buy into her story. That said, this not a happy tale. Fans likely expect that, since Sony referred to the plot as one of a quest for vengeance. But The Last of Us Part II takes many dark turns. It twists, mangling your expectations and, with it, your sense of comfort.

I can’t count the number of times I stared wide-eyed at the screen, thinking, “No. That can’t be right. That can’t be how this goes.”
And while I thought I knew Ellie, playing the game feels like running into an old friend I grew apart from. Sure, that’s her — but she’s older, and her attitude has grown from a spunky, tough kid to a jaded survivor.
Ellie is still fiercely loyal and fearless, but she’s lost the hope she had in the first game. That’s likely because, in the original, Ellie was on her way to helping to find a cure. It’s clear the failure of that mission took a piece of her optimism and growing up in a post-apocalyptic world while still dealing with the torturous pressures of being a teenager hasn’t helped.
We see her coming out story and her anguish over telling Joel about her first girlfriend. This narrative piece is especially beautiful, and I was glad to see Ellie’s feelings explored with the same sincerity as a heterosexual relationship.

Naughty Dog
Her relationship with Joel deepens, too, as they create a new life after the events of the first game. There’s a flashback to one of her birthdays, and the time they spend bonding is a potent reminder that family isn’t just made up of blood relatives.
Still, Ellie is older. She has questions, and she already wasn’t one to shy away from questioning authority. And after her and Joel’s failed vaccine quest, seeing people turn from a bite becomes more difficult.
At times, Ellie is unrecognizable, even to herself.

The event that sets Ellie off to seek revenge takes even more from her.
At times, our protagonist is unrecognizable, even to herself. Watching her journey — actively taking part but unable to change course — is painful. The writing makes The Last of Us Part II one of the greatest gaming experiences I’ve ever had. It reminds me of the games that my mom, who really did not understand my fascination with video games, would look over my shoulder to watch. The ones that got her to stop asking, “Aren’t you tired of playing that?” and instead sit down next to me. That got her to comment to my stepdad quietly, “It’s like a movie.”
Much like the first The Last of Us, the narrative will remind players why they love to play and birth a new generation of gamers.
While Ellie is the star, the story does extend beyond her. I was swept up in the lives of characters I would never meet, some dead, some still out there somewhere. You’ll find documents and mementos, much like in the last game. But this time, the game does a better job of creating stories that can last the span of the game. One document in an early area connects to one in a later level. A person mentioned in one note is the writer of another. And in the times when I came across an unseen character’s final note near their body, or worse, in a room with an infected, I was heartbroken.
It’s been teased that Part II is darker, but I wasn’t prepared.

Again, this goes beyond Ellie. The world is at war with itself. Differing factions suffer on both sides following the dissipation of a truce, one that neither party takes blame for. There’s also the profound, moral question of which side is the right side. People previously aligned with the government-sanctioned FEDRA, the counter-movement of the Fireflies, or opted to answer only for themselves. But this isn’t just about survival. It’s about what society looks like as the remains of human civilization try desperately to hang on.

When you kill a human enemy, their friends will cry out for them. They each have names. Their allies will be devastated to come across their dead body, and not because it means they themselves are in danger. It’s a heartwrenching, but realistic, detail, and it makes the game shine while leaving you with a pit in your stomach.
Gameplay
Expanding the game to include so many elements means opening up the map. Although not truly an open-world game, some levels are large and complex, and exploring them is absolutely worth your time.
When it comes to game mechanics, it doesn’t fix what isn’t broken.

I was delighted to come across Easter eggs, unravel a story through notes left behind and clues, or find an especially handy equipment pickup by going out of my way. 
There are also small moments that trigger cutscenes, and appear entirely optional. Some bits were just cute, but others added a deep emotional layer. I highly suggest checking everything out, and I’ll likely set out on another completionist run myself.
Naughty Dog
Still, The Last of Us Part II is a linear game, and gating — where you’re prevented from going back to a previous area — removes any illusion this could be a true sandbox title.
When it comes to game mechanics, it doesn’t fix what isn’t broken. It operates much like the first game but fine-tunes combat. Stealth gets smarter, there are new enemies, and there are ability trees you can invest resources into depending on your preferred fighting style. I found it easy to jump back in and appreciated the new elements.

Visuals and details
The visuals of The Last of Us Part II are, quite simply, magnificent. The detail of the environment and objects are absolutely phenomenal. I played on a base PlayStation 4 with HDR on, and I was floored that I wasn’t playing in 4K. It really looks that good. Textures look exceptionally detailed, and landscapes look incredible. This is particularly important given the amount of time spent outside.
The character detailing might be even more impressive. There’s a small part where Ellie looks in the mirror making different faces, and it’s not a cutscene. The animations look so good, it feels like the developers are showing off.

It would, of course, be remiss not to mention the crunch that went into this game. Naughty Dog has received criticism over its practice of making its team put in grueling hours to complete this and other games. It’s an absolute shame that anyone would work under those conditions, and they are the unsung heroes that made this game as good as it is.
They’ve included so many intricacies to be explored. The options menu allows you to individually customize the difficulty of things like enemy health or the number of resources you’ll find.
More importantly, players can change the controls to make it more accessible in a variety of ways. Visually, changes can be made to make subtitles easier to read or to see important details. There’s also a text-to-speech option and motion sickness settings. Players can even change how to play the guitar or operate a boat. These options are also made apparent with on-screen notifications, and other accessibility options are made known at the start. It’s a great move that I hope to see in more titles.
All these details make The Last of Us Part II an incredibly powerful game.

Our take
The Last of Part II is a tour de force that takes the best parts of the original and molds them into their finest forms. The story will leave you reeling, and there are several unexpected turns that will keep you invested throughout. The level of detail and quality in the world creation and story building are at the top of their class.
Is there a better alternative?
There isn’t anything quite like The Last of Us Part II, let alone a better alternative. The gameplay and combat aren’t unique, but the story that takes place around those elements is singular. It’s also why people bought into the first game so heavily.
How long will it last?
The campaign takes anywhere from 30 to 40 hours, easily reaching the latter if you’re keen on exploring and finding everything available. If you just want to get through the story, 30 hours is closer to accurate, but even narrative-driven players will benefit from some extra exploration.
Should you but it?
Yes, absolutely. The Last of Us Part II will go down as a classic game that people talk about for years to come, not unlike the first iteration. The fact that this title expands so much on what worked well makes it that much easier to justify adding it to your library.

The Last of Us Part II,Justin Clark,Slant Magazine,https://www.slantmagazine.com/games/review-the-last-of-us-part-ii-is-a-gory-and-complex-feat-of-empathetic-storytelling/,"The game displays a thorough, haunted understanding of what cruelty for cruelty’s sake can do to the soul.The moment that Naughty Dog announced a sequel to The Last of Us, we knew a day of reckoning was coming. No matter how one felt about Joel, the grizzled protagonist of the 2013 game, it was inevitable that his actions—saving 14-year-old Ellie’s life at the expense of the human race—would have consequences. And the first and most expected of those consequences occurs not even an hour into The Last of Us Part II, when, four years after the events of the first game, a small militia manages to snatch Joel, and his surrogate daughter, after coming to his rescue, watches him meet a particularly grisly end.Yes, of course, Ellie goes after Joel’s killers, a hunt that leads her—along with her ride-or-die girlfriend, Dina—to Seattle, where the militia is embroiled in a bloody civil war with an urban-agrarian pseudo-Christian cult known as the Seraphites. And all the while, the Cordyceps epidemic continues to roil, making new, hideous, screeching monsters by the day, and in even more horrifying, hard-to-kill forms than before. And, of course, the underlying message of the whole thing, belabored by so many zombie stories before this one, is that humans are the real monsters, and that it takes a certain innate viciousness to survive in a world of monsters.Which isn’t to say that The Last of Us Part II gets too high and mighty about the ugly, gratuitous nature of revenge. If it was, the game’s violence wouldn’t be necessary, justified, or cathartic—and killing here is often all three of those things at once. This is a game that asks players to accept the multitudes of its heroes, its villains, and every other poor, suffering soul that Ellie and Dina encounter throughout their journey, about what it means to be another monster among monsters, and what purpose that grotesquery serves.That, though, is still a hard ask for a game like this. As in the original, you sneak, scavenge, shoot, stab, and bludgeon your way through the world, and The Last of Us Part II is home to some of the most ferocious acts of sinewy, effective, and affecting violence in a video game, and they’re made all the more lurid and visceral by being rendered in unparalleled detail that’s consistent with the rest of the story. That’s even more egregious given that the story could have been just as effective without the game’s utter realism being an imperative by any means necessary, especially given the despicable, and well-documented, human cost of achieving that level of detail. And just like most of Naughty Dog’s forays into cinematic action games, what goes on in the cutscenes is only tenuously connected with everything going on in the rest of the campaign.As a gameplay experience, The Last of Us Part II brings just the right amount of that Uncharted-like intensity into its every set piece. You’re still best served by sneaking around enemies instead of facing them directly, but unlike the first game, you’re also not utterly doomed by choosing to face them head-on. Being prepared and armed to the teeth is the real deciding factor here, and the player is given much more freedom to figure out how to best accomplish that. Do you take out your enemies with a shiv or a switchblade? Do you have the materials for a makeshift silencer? Are you so overloaded with ammo that you can afford to get loud? Or do you just make a mad dash for an exit, praying that the door isn’t blocked? Once you have set your goal, the overall approach to achieving it is up to you, and that’s a massive and welcome improvement over the first game.Most of the gameplay takes place in a semi-open world that recalls that of Naughty Dog’s underrated Uncharted: The Lost Legacy. The starting and end points of any given area are largely set in stone, but you can wander the ruins of Seattle across a wide expanse, and there’s an impressive number of fully rendered and true-to-life locations that you’re free to explore. Entire neighborhoods feel like real, once-lived-in places, frozen in time, derelict and overgrown. An abandoned music store isn’t just a depository for ammo and health items, with a few records strewn around, but a place that felt as if it was desperately looted during an apocalypse and now has been overtaken by vines and serves as a sanctuary for those who should need it.The closest that the gameplay comes to elegantly and seamlessly pairing with the overarching story occurs in such places, where Ellie and Dina feel safe enough to sing to each other, or talk about old movies, comic books they’ve found, their families, and the like. Respite and genuine engagement with the game’s morality is also offered up by the periodic flashbacks, which fill in the gaps of time in between our leaving Ellie behind in 2013 and our glimpsing the wiry, flint-eyed killer she became. These sections are all playable, and range from beautiful moments of wonder and curiosity, even laugh-out-loud humor, to devastating flashes of revelation, to the game’s biggest and most meaningful curveball, when the entire climax is put on hold while players step into the shoes of the girl, Abby, who killed Joel and is now Ellie’s ultimate target.One might feel an understandable sense of consternation when this shift in perspective happens in the game, as Ellie’s story is already too long for its own good by the time it reaches its logical climax. But Abby, who’s built like a shot putter and commandingly voiced by Laura Bailey, is a beautifully imposing and undeniably captivating presence. But more than this, Abby’s story represents a crucial narrative shift for The Last of Us Part II, not in the sense that it humanizes the enemies that Ellie has been taking out up to this point, but for the way it allows the game’s actual theme to reveal itself. You start the campaign thinking that the story is about revenge, when it’s really one about mercy, of the meaning of sacrifice and letting go.We learn about Abby’s connection to Joel early on during this shift in perspective, but much of her story is set in the aftermath of his murder, once Abby has returned to her Seattle militia, the Washington Liberation Front (WLF), whose members are also known as Wolves, and life goes on as usual. But that changes when her ex-boyfriend, a fellow soldier named Owen (Patrick Fugit), goes missing, and Abby goes AWOL in order to find him. And that journey leads her to Lev and Yara, siblings and former members of the Seraphites.The closest that The Last of Us Part II gets to true villains are the Seraphites, and yet they aren’t seen as just outright evil. Hard and fast details about why this hyper-conservative order is the way it is are thin on the ground, but we know not to have too much empathy for them when you find out they’ve sentenced Lev to die for the “crime” of being transgender. The second one of these people deadnames the poor kid before trying to shoot him with a crossbow, Abby’s story very quickly becomes a roaring, bloody act of defiance solely to allow Lev and Yara—and, by extension, herself—the opportunity to live a life free of these horrors. You may feel conflict about how many Wolves need to die so Ellie can get her revenge. But you feel much, much less of that the more you realize how much the Seraphites hold Lev in contempt for just existing.Even then, there’s a lot of blood spilled on the way to freedom, culminating on Abby’s side in one of the most breathtaking, anxiety-inducing action set pieces ever executed in a video game: a breakneck ride through a burning village that feels like the barbarous hate-child of Atlanta burning in Gone with the Wind and the single-shot warzone in Children of Men. Once again, there’s a faint sense in these scenes of the even stronger experience that could have been, of a story being truly told through gameplay, not cutscenes. A sequence where Lev has to coax Abby through her fear of heights to cross a man-made bridge between skyscrapers is maybe the second most tense sequence in the game, and there’s not a single Seraphite or Infected to kill in it. It’s hard not to see the frequent shootout sections as a crutch preventing the developers from thinking of sequences that are more like this one, places to give the player something more to do than engage in stealth action.That’s despite the fact that the game is certainly aiming for more with the cinematics, and how it paints Abby and Ellie on opposite sides of a gory existential crisis, one where Ellie is blindly screaming and clawing for a life that has purpose, and Abby actually finding it. Where The Last of Us Part II leads both of them is quite haunting, a place where uneasy, wrenching questions are answered, such as at what point do we determine the cost of hate, chaos, death, and vengeance to be more or less than the cost of simply stopping?The risk that came with making a sequel to The Last of Us was the possibility of rendering the great ambiguous ending of that game null and void. To their absolute credit, the developers at Naughty Dog have crafted a story here that walks right into that fire, and wrestles with the implications and consequences of Joel’s lie in full. It’s hard not to trace every human failure in The Last of Us Part II back to that lie, and the strongest, most special moments here are examples of unmistakably human grace transcending that self-interest, even when the game is at its darkest. It’s in Ellie seeking comfort in her girlfriend’s arms to calm her shaking hands, Lev slowly discarding the shackles of his old-time religion, but sharing the parts of it that mattered with a frightened friend. It’s in forgiveness and acceptance, in all its various, excruciating forms.These moments are myriad throughout this sequel, and they’re so unlike what you find in a game operating on the AAA level. The Last of Us Part II is still sending a very awkward message about how much mercy truly matters when so many of the campaign’s most complex, graceful moments are out of the player’s control, but the vast majority of its moments of cruelty—thrilling and righteous though they can often be—aren’t. That’s a failure of the creative space the game inhabits as a big, expansive blockbuster more than a failure of the game itself. But most importantly, it’s a problem only because The Last of Us Part II is a game that displays such a thorough, haunted understanding of what cruelty for cruelty’s sake can do to the human soul.This game was reviewed using a retail copy purchased by the reviewer.Justin Clark is a gaming critic based out of Massachusetts.
