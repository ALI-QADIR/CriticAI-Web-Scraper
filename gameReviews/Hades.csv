Link Official site (opens in new tab)Different as they are, Supergiant's previous games—Pyre, Transistor, and Bastion—have all been summed up the same way. Story, art, music, voice-acting, atmosphere? A+. Combat? Kind of B-. Hades feels like a response to that, a Supergiant game that focuses on the fighting and elevates it to the absolute top-tier. This isn't a spoiler because you've looked at the score, but they nailed it. The combat's fantastic.Hades doesn't short us on the other stuff either, though it easily could have. It's a roguelike, or a roguelite, or an action-RPG with permadeath. Whatever you call it, it's a genre where story is secondary, either hidden away in the lore encyclopedia or otherwise in the back seat—the back seat of one of those cars with a window separating it from the driver.Not so in Hades, where every character is fully voiced and has more to say with every run. You're Zagreus, son of the death god, prince of the underworld. You believe the whole ""ruling in Hell"" thing is overrated, so with the help of your distant Olympian family you're going to fight through every shade, fury, and other mythic monster between you and the surface to escape. Because fuck you, Dad, that's why.The best Greek myths are about gods and heroes, and when ordinary mortals are involved they boil down to fairytale morals about how you should obey your weird husband no matter what because he might turn out to be the West Wind. Hades knows this, and focuses on legendary characters like Athena and Achilles, painting them in broad archetypal strokes. My favorite's Dionysus, god of wine, hedonism, and everybody just being like really cool, but everyone from long-suffering fury Megaera to layabout Sisyphus is brought to life, with a solid vocal portrayal and art like they stepped out of a Mike Mignola comic.Where other games hand out story as a reward for success, Hades uses it to reward failure. With each death Zagreus is sent back to the House of Hades where his father judges souls and legends gather. Doing a circuit of the court to see what new things they have to say (and give Cerberus a pat), lets you wind down and take a breath after your latest death has left your hands shaking. When I die in Dead Cells I want to quit, but in Hades the sting's immediately removed because I get to chat with an embodiment of night and see what's up with Orpheus. Then, back in the zone, I buy another round of upgrades and try again.At the start of each run you pick a legendary weapon, like the Aegis shield, accept a boon, like the one from Dionysus that adds hangover damage (read ""poison"") to your attacks, and enter the first of the underworld's three realms. They're made up of randomized chambers where a set number of enemies spawn, you vanquish them, collect a reward, and enter the next chamber.Every weapon's agreeably unique. Hold down attack with the shield and you'll block, then bull-rush forward. Its special lets you bounce it off enemies then catch it like Hellenic Captain America. The spear can also be thrown and recalled, but only comes back when commanded, letting you reposition first and line up new shades to skewer, while its hold-down attack is an area-of-effect spin. Then there's the Adamant Rail, which is literally a gun, complete with grenade launcher attachment.In addition you've got a ranged attack called a cast and can unlock a call, an ultimate granted by whichever god you've got favor with that's earned by filling up a god gauge. I often forget about the call because that gauge doesn't stand out beneath the attention-grabbing red health bar, though sometimes a text pop-up will remind me (probably because the game knows I rarely use the thing). The real star in your arsenal is a dash that can take you through enemies and objects, and combines with attacks for a dash-strike. Whoever's responsible for the timing and animation should pat themselves on the back, because dashing feels great, whether used to backstab a skeleton, or to warp through a column just as the minotaur charges so he slams his cowlick into a big lump of marble instead of me.Mobility's essential, not just to avoid attacks but to set up wall slams for bonus damage, trigger traps then dash out of the blast zone, and knock down support columns to bring down chunks of masonry. Getting into a rhythm, launching a combo then zooming around the battlefield like I've got wings on my sandals, puts me in such a focused flow-state I don't notice the soundtrack accentuating the action. If a game can distract me from Darren Korb rocking out then it's doing everything right.What Hades' combat reminds me of is Bastion's dream challenges, especially when played with oddball late-game weapon combinations. Bastion's combat was seen as its weak spot, but my hot take about a game from 2011 is that the fighting ruled actually, and Hades feels like an evolution of it—only invoking gods in Hades gives blessings instead of curses and upgrades can be bought mid-run as well as back at your hub.I should talk about the upgrades, yeah? Gold coins, obols from the eyes of the dead, can be spent at Charon's shop when it pops up in a chamber for temporary buffs and heals, while shards of darkness can be spent in the House of Hades for permanent upgrades, like backstab damage or the ability to defy death and come back at half-health when you'd otherwise fall. Gems buy renovations for the hub but also for the underworld, adding rooms with healing pools or urns that can be smashed for obols.I haven't even mentioned the diamonds, titan blood, and other currencies later in the game. It may sound like a bit much, but it's handed out at an even pace, and the steady improvements feel balanced to my own improvement as I play. Shortly after I got used to working cast attacks into my dash-reliant tactics, I bought an upgrade for more damage to anyone I've used my cast on. There's a parity between its rewards and my own skills, both pushing me further. It's the most I've been engaged with a roguelike's upgrade tree since Rogue Legacy.That's half of what keeps me coming back to Hades, and the other half is the unfolding story of Zagreus. He could easily have been the worst flavor of videogame protagonist, an angry buff princeling smoldering with generic rage. Instead it's his father Hades, a goth beefcake Santa who spends all day shouting at paperwork and moaning about his underlings, who fills that role. Zagreus is likeable, with a wry sense of humor, and when Hades sarcastically asks how the latest attempt at trashing the realm goes he replies, ""My ransacking was a delight, thanks for asking."" The prince also just seems like a decent person, listening to shades when they talk about how they died, appreciating the house servant who is also a severed gorgon head, and taking note of who the employee of the day is while saying, hey, good for you, Achilles.Sure, I want every run to end in victory, but I also want to buy that music stand for the throne room, unlock all the keepsakes, and see how this romantic subplot plays out. Like Orpheus I look back, only unlike him I'm happy to keep repeating this cycle.Action so intense it'll leave you jittery and hopped-up on adrenaline, and characters to die for.Jody's first computer was a Commodore 64, so he remembers having to use a code wheel to play Pool of Radiance.

Hades,Christian Donlan,Eurogamer,https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-09-17-hades-review-of-myth-and-mayhem,"God tier.I love what Hades is made of. It's made of mythology, of course - Zeus and Nyx and all that other spontaneous, terrifying, pitiable lot who have been lurking in their own form of Early Access for millenia. And it's made of everything the developer Supergiant has learned from making dashing, finely poised action games like Bastion and Transistor - and storied, wilful, luminous oddities like Pyre. 
But it's also made of stone so smoothly polished it reads like glass or water. It's made of lap pools of blood, of palm columns shot through with arteries of twinkling jewels. Even when you're pushing a raft across lava there's a sense that the rocks around you are just so, that they melt and ooze because artists have thought about their insides, and are in love, above all else, with texture. After every run of Zagreus' attempts to escape the underworld, he returns to a house that is positively lurid with texture and sharp edges and glimmer. The famed gods live in a sort of McMansion, or a Las Vegas hotel's Presidential Suite, bad taste spared absolutely no expense. Of course they live somewhere like this. Maybe life and death is just one big casino. Maybe these gods play dice and then hit the slots.Most of this textured stuff is designed to shatter. Hades is a Roguelite brawler, so each run is a run into hell and, hopefully, out the other side, and in between failures you spend earnings on new abilities and unlocks. But brawler is too padded and fleshy and imprecise a word, the clumsy heel of a palm, the stub of a haphazard elbow. During the run, during the failures, you are a wrecking ball with the focus of a laser, taking down pillars, slamming things into walls, blasting stone and crystal into shrapnel clouds of thick, gritty air. Supergiant chose Zagreus as a protagonist because he is a bit of a pencil shadow in the mythological texts - hazy shape and no real substance, a whisper of graphite. The writing team styles him as the kind of irresistibly arch Ivy League hardnut that Donna Tartt writes about so well, bruised cheekbones and dewy forehead, lip a dissolute twist just waiting to attain its precarious hold on a Gauloise. He is charismatic and chancy, refined without being remotely delicate. But then the game's action comes along and turns him into the part of every episode of The Property Brothers where teardown kicks in - mallet meets plasterboard and the sky is busy with splintered timber. The kitchen becomes a crater in seconds. The violence is backed by the unflinching heft of metal. What a complicated fellow.None of the rest of the game would matter if it wasn't fun to hit things. And on this topic, I've sometimes worried that Supergiant, a developer blessed and cursed with rare taste, is going to end up a victim of that taste, turning out theoretically exquisite mechanisms that chime a little hollow. I've worried that the team's output will even gloss away into mere brute luxury - Lambos or Swarovski swans. I'm wrong so far! What's surprising about Hades, to me at least, is how gutsy it is, how vitally in love with connection it is. It lives to clobber. Room after room of hell. You turn up and wait for horrors. The horrors arrive and, jeepers, you shred them. You pulverise them. I have never felt so sorry for the stuff of nightmares.Combat is based on a main attack and a special, along with a dodge and a cast, which means you lob a glossy gem into a baddy and it does them ill, but then lodges there, annoyingly, for longer than you might want it to. Beyond that it's based on weapon choices that define how attacks and specials play out. Arrows and flinging shields are my favourite options to pick between at the moment - Hawkeye's fine, but it's great to be Captain America. Beyond that, though, or rather deep down and underneath it all - I was moving in the wrong direction with those 'beyonds' and now I can't fix it - it's about this feeling the game has. And it's the same feeling you get from the Vegas hotel landscape of the early areas, even when you're gadding through the heather of Elysium - you sock-slide and grip suddenly, smooth and swift and then THWACK. Everything is a spin on this feeling: coasting on air, and then colliding. The darting hummingbird and the copper-bottomed saucepan.The things you're smacking around are wonderful. Even early on you can expect bloated ghosts with huge bellies, flesh stained the sunset colours of Florida cocktails, nasty little all-legged things with sacks of horrors on their backs. Later how about a massive snake of bones, a deadly library book stamp, bullet-hell witches and a field filled with butterfly spewing gumballs? Bosses are great and draw from the classics, but I particularly love a cluster of gems from the very first rooms that bobbles around before striking you from afar. It is so hard to be personally aggrieved by jewelry, but Hades manages to get you there. It makes glittering stone something you can hate with woozy passion.These things come at you in waves, in procedurally scrambled rooms that have their own deadly doodads. In the first areas, you generally only have to worry about spike pits or turrets with trigger pads, so I leaned rather heavily on that dash. But then the second area throws lava everywhere, so overzealous dashing generally ends in unintentional barbecue. Onwards and upwards - risk and reward, risk and reward. And then...?You choose which rooms to travel through from a handful of doors that appear when you clear out all the baddies. Generally you're picking between what kind of pay-off you want once the next battle is done. The old gods were so baldly transactional. More health? One of a handful of in-game currencies for levelling up over time? Or a chance to get a gift from the squabbling cast of ancients?This might be one of my favourite things about Hades. Over many runs you get stronger and last longer and get different weapons to try out. Fine. But each individual run is shaped by the gods you meet and the things you choose when they offer you a handful of their themed perks to pick from. Like the contents of the shopkeeper's store in Spelunky, this stuff can really mix things up and define an adventure. And the choices are often almost impossible. A dash that poisons or an attack that poisons? More doom or a brand new special? Do I want the people I have already killed, right, to make living enemies sick?The gods who deliver this stuff are wonderfully charming and untrustworthy and vain and drunken - the underworld is a Bluth Company construct, right down to the McMansion you all live in - but what really clicks for me is the way that this procedural game allows you to procedurally clip together your own Zagreus each time, and each time it's bittersweet because you know things won't fall together in quite this way ever again. It's sad in Spelunky when I don't get the jetpack, but for one glorious ten minute spell in Hades I had a shield that bounced around between enemies for a hilariously long time and left electricity in its clattering wake. I could chuck my shield, do the school run and return in time to catch it in the middle of a room in which everyone but me had been fatally pummelled in my absence. Meanwhile my dash spawned dark little infernal whirlpools that dragged enemies in for extra damage. Haven't Lego-bricked that one together again since.When it's done it's back to Dad's house to mope into the bedroom, spend a few upgrade points, chat to the relatives and then head out once more. Hell is a loop. Of course it is. But each circuit fills out the characters and deepens the connections until I have started to warm to Zagreus, for all his poise and chill.All of which is to say: Hades is a proper lark. I love it. But there is something else here, something that I have always felt about games but never been able to put into words. There is something about polished, smartly conceived Hades, about so many of Supergiant's games which, the joyous brilliance of Pyre aside perhaps, are always too rigorous, too responsibly conceived not to know exactly what spot they're going to fit into on the shelf, which pillars they're going to present to the press - there is something about these games that are so assuredly products that reminds me that games are never ever just products. Games are always a way of being. To play Hades, Roguelite aside, economy aside, loop aside, is to be furious and vengeful, to be driven by bitterness, self-hate, ennui, to be pulverisingly powerful and yet horribly efficient. This is the truth of it down to the controls, which encourage you to grip the pad by the facebuttons and squeeze and squeeze and squeeze like you're one stress ball away from telling your boss to shove it.This game comes from Hell, and it takes you back there, and it's brilliant.

Hades,Matt Miller,Game Informer,https://www.gameinformer.com/review/hades/hades-review-the-highs-and-lows-of-repetition,"Developer Supergiant Games is known for creating titles with rich narratives and sophisticated themes, and one of the great triumphs of Hades is how those elements are seamlessly integrated into a roguelite structure. Through a seemingly limitless array of character interactions and plot progression, Hades seeds its storytelling over many hours of repeated runs, as you lead your character along one attempted escape from hell to the next. In addition to weapon and character upgrades, new story insights are among the most satisfying rewards. But that also means that you’ll be eager to see those plot threads resolve, and to do that, you should prepare for an especially long road.Zagreus is the son of mighty Hades, who rules the realm of the dead with a barely controlled anger only matched by his insistence on total control. He’s the definition of an overbearing father, and Zagreus’ desire to strike out on his own feels as much like a family drama as the retelling of a familiar mythology. His quest to find a mother he’s never known brings him into contact with a who’s who of Olympus and the Greek ancient world, including Zeus, Athena, Achilles, and Medusa. The constantly shifting dynamics between these characters makes for great fun, from the sibling rivalry among the Olympians to reconnecting old flames like Orpheus and Eurydice, and I love the way story tidbits creep in both between action sequences and during them.Each escape attempt encompasses a series of isometric arena battles, assaulting an impressive variety of enemies in throwdowns that demand precision and careful observation. The combat is fast-paced and challenging, nodding more to stylish action games like Devil May Cry than the isometric RPGs it might look like at first glance. The sense of adrenaline is always high, but there’s also a potential for encounters to devolve into frantic button mashing as you spam out every available attack to bring foes down before they can unleash their worst counters.New weapons unlock regularly, and they can dramatically change your playstyle, from the precision of the Heart-Seeking Bow to the furious melee dominance of the Twin Fists of Malphon. The most impressive design feat is how even the same weapon inevitably feels different on each run, as god-gifted boons alter and enhance individual armaments, spells, and other abilities. As I got into the rhythm of flowing from one death into my next attempt, I was consistently excited to see how my approach might change.Among the many familiar names encountered, Zagreus gets to know the good-natured Sisyphus, who endlessly pushes a boulder up a hill he will never top, never complaining of his task. It’s an appropriate allegory that speaks to the broader game, which kept me engaged thanks to its slow drip of character improvement and fiction, but along a path that felt increasingly Sisyphean the longer I played. I spent dozens of hours picking away at the various plot threads and chasing upgrades. It’s enjoyable, but as the hours wear on, my interest in the same sequence of chambers wore thin. I longed for a wrap-up, even as the game demanded more escape attempts. Even after “winning,” that tease continues for hours more before a proper conclusion.The story is stretched across too many hours of play to maintain excitement throughout, but there’s absolutely a rich bounty of content to uncover along the way. Hades is a massive game, with a wealth of additional content to appease even the most hardcore of engagement. A “god mode” offers a gradual increase in damage resistance after each death, putting victory in reach for even those with a cap on their skills. On the other hand, risk-takers looking for more rewards can eventually access a way to increase the difficulty. Alternate boss fights, new weapon aspects, hidden storylines, and plenty more invite the player to get lost in Hades’ potential. These variants and additional options provide life to the game, long after the charm of standard completion attempts begins to wear out. Even serious engagement doesn't ensure story completion without many hours of investment, and only the most dedicated players will see the full spread of what Hades has to offer. But Supergiant’s latest opus is a beautiful and thoughtful twist on Greek mythology, flipping these old stories on their head and transforming them into commentaries on modern relationships. High-octane action gameplay may pull you into hell for the first time, but I suspect you’ll stay to find out about this eccentric and fascinating family.

Hades,Ryan Gilliam,Polygon,https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/9/24/21453043/hades-review-switch-windows-early-access-supergiant-roguelite-impressions,"Filed under:An aged, fine wine that would make Dionysus himself proudHades asks you what lengths you would go to defy your shitty dad. Would you stay up late? Mess up his garden? Escape the Greek underworld against his will? In Hades, you are that defiant son. And your asshole dad? That would be Hades, brother to Zeus and Poseidon, lord of the Underworld. And my frequent attempts to escape his grasp make up one of the best games I’ve played all year.I drop into the Underworld at the start of my run — falling gracefully from my second story window in the House of Hades. With my giant sword, I venture forth into Tartarus, just one piece of the Greek underworld. I pick up a random upgrade on my way out the door, increasing my combat potential or drastically altering the way I battle.I obliterate the minions of Hades through random room after random room filled with the cloudy, lost souls hoping to send me back to where I started. I’m awarded a different upgrade after every battle. My strength grows, giving me the power I need to climb even higher as I try to reach the surface. But as always happens in games like Hades, I make a misstep, I lose all my health, and I die. I fall into a pool of blood and go back to where I started. But when I wake up back at home, Hades reveals its true nature. It’s a game where each attempt to get to the end is a run where I battle through the world, collect some resources, and start over with new, permanent upgrades. But Hades maintains the narrative focus and charm found in Supergiant’s other titles — Bastion, Transistor, and Pyre.

If you want curated lists of our favorite media, check out What to Play and What to Watch.I stop by Hypnos, who turns to me and offers me his condolences on my failure — remarking on whatever beast managed to take me down. And then I approach the desk of my father, Hades. I’m not just some wayward soul trying to escape the underworld, after all, I’m prince of the underworld: Zagreus. Hades has the gruff temperament of Kratos from God of War, acting as if I’ll never do anything good enough for him. The more I talk to him, the more I think there’s some kind of affection beneath his mean exterior, but it’s rare that you ever hear it in his voice. As we chat, Zagreus himself has the smug air of a young adult committed to his goth attitude and aesthetic. Every comment from Zagreus to his father is sarcastic or accusatory. He’s spent eons dealing with Hades, just as Hades has spent eons dealing with Zagreus. There’s a shared history between these two characters, a mix of mistrust, love, exhaustion and frustration. Hades lives in that place of self-superiority, certain that his son will never understand the lengths he’s gone through to be a father and lord of the Underworld. He doesn’t seem to have the time or patience to deal with his son’s rebellion any longer. In response, Zagreus exudes a real “fuck you, old man” attitude, but he’s too cool to ever say it out loud, preferring a sarcastic nod and a biting comment to direct, verbal confrontation. Father and son always part ways with a dismissive laugh or frustrated sigh.Each time I come back from a run through the Underworld, I’m able to have a new conversation with different characters inside Hades’ house. Occasionally, I find Nectar out in the Underworld, which I can give to my friends as gifts, improving my relationship with my mentor Achilles, my step-mother Nyx, and a whole cast of characters — netting me new dialogue and trinkets to help with my escape plan. I enter my room to spend some currency I found on my last run — upgrading myself and increasing my chances at success — and move into the armory. I collect a trinket — gifts from my loved ones — talk to Skelly, my sentient practice dummy, and select a weapon from Hades’ arsenal. Now wielding a spear, I jump back into Tartarus from my second story window and start climbing again.Hades is shown from a top-down perspective. I get to see Zagreus, and all my friends up close when they speak — thanks to beautiful character portraits — but most of the time I’m a red blur dashing between enemies.As Zagreus, I have a deceptively simple combat arsenal. I have a basic attack, a special move, a dash, and a ranged attack called a Cast that fires a ranged barb that sticks into enemies for a brief time. And I have these attacks for each of my six weapons — but I can select only one weapon prior to each run. I can upgrade and alter each of these moves every run, and they combine into something unique every time I play. When I first land in the courtyard of Tartarus, the game randomly offers me one of two things: a Boon or a Daedalus Hammer. The Daedalus Hammer is one of the most desirable upgrades in the game, dramatically  altering how my weapon works. For example, the special ability on the shield is a Captain America-type throw that bounces between a few targets before returning to me. The Daedalus Hammer increases the number of times my shield bounces between enemies. This may not sound exciting at first, but combined with powerful Boons, it could be the key to my escape attempt.The Daedalus Hammer is rare, and I’m lucky to have more than two on any given run. Boons are far more common. These are upgrades passed to me by my uncles and cousins in Olympus. Zagreus has never met Ares, Poseidon, Zeus, Hera, or any of the others, but they all feel sympathy for him. He’s a nice enough kid, and eager to meet his family, and they all know that his dad is the ultimate asshole in Greek myth. So these Boons imbue Zagreus with a fraction of the gods’ powers, to help him on his journey — like handing your nephew a wad of cash before they go off to college and hoping they spend it on more than cigarettes and beer.These Boons offer me minor effects that impact various aspects of combat, usually focused on my attack, special, or Cast. If I pick up the Daedalus upgrade that lets my shield bounce, maybe I would want to find a Zeus Boon that causes my special to spawn lightning bolts on every enemy hit by my special attack? Or a Boon from Dionysus that transforms my Cast into a hazy pool that stuns and poisons targets inside, keeping them still for my shield to bounce.Every run I combine new effects like these together. More often than not, I smile at how absurdly powerful my Zagreus has become. But a good build isn’t everything; I still need to survive my voyage through the Underworld. When I clear my first chamber, I’m presented with a choice of doors. Each has different symbols on the outside, previewing the upgrade I’ll get for completing that room. Do I want a boon from Athena? Or I could just get some gold to shop with? Charon, the boatman, has an underworld shop where I can buy health, Boons, and a variety of other items. No matter what I choose, I move forward. Eventually I reach the first boss, the Furies. This boss fight has a few different varieties, which can change things up between runs. But aside from a few, altered moves, it’s a consistent experience. If I choose upgrades that focus Zagreus’ power too much on clearing rooms filled with basic enemies, I may struggle on the boss fight. And if I focus too much on a boss-killing Zagreus build, I’ll suffer on my way there. When I succeed, I get a brief moment to rest and heal before moving on to the next area of the underworld. Healing doesn’t come easy in Hades, and I take every piece of food, healing fountain, or health bonus I can find. But my failure takes time. At first, I’m sent back to the House of Hades when my health hits zero, but as I go, I gain the ability to revive myself multiple times each run. I see my losses coming rooms away, and more often than not, it’s at the hands of the game’s final boss, in the fourth level of the underworld. But even when I beat that boss and finish my journey, it’s not over. The game tempts me with new materials to upgrade my weapons further and customize my home. But no matter how many runs I win or how many times I’ve fallen, I’m always jumping out that window again, just trying to see what that first upgrade will be, and then the next, and then the next. Hades has been a comfort game for me since it launched into early access in 2018, and it’s especially been an excellent source of comfort over the past few days — something we’re all in short supply of in 2020. I started my first journey through the Underworld in Hades two years ago. The game functioned basically the same as it does now. It was an excellent, fully functional game — albeit with only two bosses. I ran through the first few areas, and got stuck on the Bone Hydra for days. The Bone Hydra was, at the time, the game’s final boss, but is now only the second of four. Every time I tried out a new Hades patch, I would get lost in an endless cycle of runs for a week, and all my gaming time would disappear. Hades has always been so good that it’s hard to put down, and now it’s feature complete with the 1.0 launch on both Nintendo Switch and PC. It’s the same game I loved in 2018, but more of it. More build variety, more weapons, more characters, more areas, more secrets, more story, more everything. Whether it’s the game’s smooth combat, deep loot systems, or engrossing story, I’m always motivated to boot it up and go for another run. Hades is that rare triple threat — like that kid in high school that could act, sing, AND dance. Try as I might, I cannot find fault in Hades. It’s even created a calm in me that no other similar game has. Loss isn’t a frustrating experience met with loud swear words and the sounds of scrambling feet made by my previously sleeping cats. Failure is just another step on a long adventure with one of my favorite games, years in the making and well-worth the wait. Hades left early access on Sept. 17 for Nintendo Switch and Windows PC.

Hades,Nathan Grayson,Kotaku,https://kotaku.com/hades-the-kotaku-review-1845204803,"Hades is my game of the year. It’s also the game of the year. I don’t mean to say that Hades is objectively the best, because that’s an impossible metric (and also Baldur’s Gate 3 isn’t out yet). Rather, developer Supergiant’s Greek mythology-flavored action roguelike is, improbably, the game that best characterizes the year 2020. (This review discusses Hades’ story in a fair amount of depth and includes both minor and major spoilers. I’ve denoted the sections where major spoilers occur. If you haven’t finished the game—and I mean really finished it—and wish to avoid spoilers, probably skip those sections.)As other writers have observed, Hades, which entered early access in 2018 and recently launched its 1.0 version after almost two years of additional development, is about being trapped inside a house—the house of your crappy dad, Hades, specifically—and coming to terms with the fact that you cannot leave. More than that, it is a game whose structure and story are both rooted in repeated, inescapable failure. As Zagreus, the son of Hades, you try to slash, shield bash, spear, bow, punch, and gun your way out of hell, but no matter how many demonic shades fall after (ode to a Grecian) earning your ire, you end up back where you started.2020, in case you yourself are a celestial being who exists outside of time, has been a year of constant setbacks. It began with a horribly mismanaged pandemic that’s claimed over 200,000 lives in America alone. Now each passing moment brings fresh tragedy or injustice. Every day, we learn of yet another failed effort on the part of good people to so much as toss a wrench into the gears of an endless number of greedy, uncaring machines—many of which have been running in some form or fashion since before any of us were ever born. We get sick. We lose our jobs. Or some combination of the resulting tension and time/distance strain the small handful of relationships we value most. As the year comes to a close, it feels like even precious patches of gained ground are slipping into the abyss. It’s become hard to focus, hard to see a point in fighting, or even just keeping up the mundane pretenses of daily life, in the face of an unabating slide into mask-off despotism.Hades is a game about what people do once they’ve realized that failure is inevitable. How do you spend your time when you live in a house built on a foundation of a failure, when all you and those around you can do is fail, when failure will come whether you act or choose to do nothing at all? Sure, the people in Hades’ case are Greek gods, but Greek gods are just people with better muscles and (slightly) worse decision-making skills when they’re horny.Supergiant describes Hades as a roguelike, but only because there’s not really a good genre descriptor that sums up what it really is. In between action-based runs through the ever-shifting halls of Tartarus, Asphodel, Elysium, and the Temple of Styx, you spend ample time talking to various gods, goddesses, shades (ghosts, basically), and Dusa, who defies categorization. Also Cerberus, who is both bigger than all other dogs and has three heads, thus making him quantifiably the best boy. You can give these characters gifts to strengthen your bonds, but just conversing with them over the course of countless runs is enough to peel back many of their layers.You get to know these characters as 10 hours give way to 20, 30, 60, and onward. When I first encountered Achilles while playing Hades’ early access version over the summer, I thought he was a dreary shadow perpetually posed against the same dull wall. Now, months later, he’s like a father, brother, and maybe more to me—a font of generosity in spite of his own past failures. These slow-build interactions, which sometimes move at a speed akin to that of real-life relationships, are just as central to Hades as making a mess of Hell on your way to the surface. Characters, in turn, react to your progress and deeds, some of which come to directly involve them. Given the number of possible permutations of your progress both through the game and with various characters, it is a mind-bogglingly complex narrative system that somehow manages to feel coherent at almost all times.You can also go fishing. And renovate your house!These relationships mean that Hades’ goals are fundamentally different from those of other roguelikes, many of which prioritize difficulty and mastery above all else. Hades builds upon that foundation, but despite a focus on failure, the game isn’t actually about the player beating their head against a series of brick walls until they finally break through. Now that many of my friends have started playing Hades, I’ve heard a few of them express frustration about particular bosses or their struggles in certain areas. I always tell them: “Give it a few more runs. You’ll get past that part, and then, a few more runs after that, you’ll be amazed that you ever had trouble in the first place.” Note that I do not say, “You’ll get past that part if you use weapon X or employ strategy Y.” Because those particulars do not matter.Despite being a game that can easily last 80 or 100 hours (if you want to do and see everything, anyway), Hades is a game that respects the heck out of players’ time. Each run yields some form of tangible progress, both in terms of character dialogue and items that can be used to permanently boost your stats, making you better able to withstand whatever challenges you face. Fights also do a subtly sublime job of preparing you for future fights; enemies and bosses call forward to each other. You might stroll into the gargantuan Bone Hydra’s lava lair for the first time and think “Oh god, I’m about to get my ass kicked,” but you’re never actually in over your head. Even if you’re having trouble making bone-heads or bone-tails of its attack patterns, you’ll eventually gain enough HP and death defiances (think “lives” in classic games) that you’ll have ample room for error. If that’s not enough, you can also toggle on “God Mode,” which gives a slight, steadily increasing boost to your damage resistance after each failed run. It makes narrative sense—you’re a friggin’ god, after all—and it doesn’t lock you out of anything.But even if you rough it, like I did, you’ll likely become powerful and savvy enough that you’ll eventually gain the presence of mind to start working your creative muscles. Each Hades run is full of randomized powerups and “boons” from various gods and goddesses that imbue Zagreus with additional powerful abilities but only last until you die. To give just a small handful of examples: Athena can put a shield around your default dash ability, allowing you to slam enemies’ projectile attacks back into them. Ares can add “Doom” to your regular or special attacks, which causes enemies to take a burst of damage after they’ve been hit (you can stack these bursts and add all kinds of fun modifiers to them, too). Artemis can boost your critical hit chance through the roof. Zeus adds lightning to abilities, because that is his main thing (aside from very bad horny decisions).I have yet to find many wrong choices here. There are definitely builds that will just melt bosses, but unlike in other roguelikes, I’ve never felt the need to seek out guides or optimal builds to give myself a real chance at success. I developed my own play style over time, and it works for me, even if it sounds—as I’ve said previously—heretical on paper. No matter which weapon I’m wielding, I never stop dashing. I don’t really use my special or cast attacks much. I focus my boon selection on raw damage and critical hit chance. I seek out Athena’s shield with religious fervor. All of this transforms Zagreus into a sort of disco ball spam cannon, and it’s a great time. I’ve completed over 20 runs, many of them with the “heat” (a set of conditions players can activate to make Hades harder, in exchange for better rewards) turned up. My method, crude though it might be, works. But I’ve also watched my partner, friends, and various Twitch streamers take other approaches that may or may not be equally effective, but are nonetheless viable, if not better.Hades presents the illusion of difficulty and a brutal learning curve, but it ensures that, no matter what, everybody will eventually get over the finish line. Its ever-changing labyrinth is a hall of mirrors, but not in a maliciously deceptive way. Rather, it intentionally seeks to invite players into a genre that, for some, has previously come across as alienating or daunting without removing any of the underlying substance. No matter how you play, you experience the tension of staring down imposing bosses, the thrill of accidentally assembling your dream build. You die a whole, whole lot, but you do it at your own pace.This brings us to Hades’ central contradiction: It is a game about failure, but it’s deeply concerned with your success. However, even when Zagreus succeeds, he still fails. He makes it to the surface—pulls off his grand escape—only to wind up back in Hell’s famed blood pool, up to his eyeballs in death. The journey isn’t really about overcoming the system you’re trapped inside of, because you can’t. Zag tries, and then he dies. Regardless of extenuating circumstances along the way—and there are many—this remains a constant.(Major spoilers begin here.)Pinched between the cruel fingers of The Fates, Hades’ story becomes a tale about reframing failure. When what you really want remains just outside your grasp, what can you do? A whole lot, it turns out. While Zagreus’ escape attempts never, say, save the world or change the course of Greek myth, each one slowly but surely improves the lives of those in his community. Initially, this is largely the byproduct of a self-serving approach: You clean up the lounge in the house of Hades so that you can exchange gems, won during runs, and other currencies for additional items and currencies that help improve subsequent runs. You give gifts to characters in exchange for “keepsakes” that yield special bonus stats and abilities for as long as they’re equipped. Other improvements follow, but they take on a decidedly less selfish, more personal bent. You help Orpheus, the dour but good-natured musician, rediscover his muse. You reconnect Achilles with his lost love. You get Megaera and her, uh, very different sisters back on speaking terms. You make a bunch of cosmetic improvements to the lounge that don’t do jack for your escape attempts, but they make the life of Dusa the Gorgon, functionally an overworked housekeeper, easier. It takes a long, long, long time for Zagreus’ relationships with his closest blood relatives to improve, but in the meantime, he creates meaningful bonds with his found family and makes his homeland a more livable place. Not only that, he reveals himself to be the kind of guy who’ll just listen to random shades talk about how they died, helpfully bring fish to the lounge’s chef, and even just quietly celebrate whoever most recently took home the title of lounge employee of the [incalculable amount of time because the future is also the present in Hell, sort of, it’s hard to explain]. Zagreus never stops being a spoiled prince, but he comes to regard everyone around him, regardless of status, as people with their own wants, needs, and existences.Zagreus begins his journey trying to get the hell out of Hades. He seeks to escape, heedless of what that might mean for those he leaves behind. There’s a sort of nihilism underpinning this: Sure, he has a very personal reason for departing, but he also sees the place itself as emblematic of his father’s failure. It’s beyond redemption, so why stay? Over time, though, his focus shifts. There is no big revelation, no on-the-nose “aha” moment that heralds this change in his personal trajectory. He just sort of starts helping other characters and rebuilding a place that’s fallen to pieces after eons of structural neglect, and even as his own situation reveals itself to be more and more dire, he ramps up his efforts. Other characters, in turn, go from being quietly insulted that he’s leaving to openly pleased that he’s staying and finally pitching in. By the time it becomes abundantly clear that Zagreus will never be able to leave Hades, you get the sense that he’s made his peace with it. He’s figured out what he can do, and though it’s not as grandiose as his original plan, it might be more important.I began playing Hades near the beginning of this summer, when it was still in early access. The game’s ending was fundamentally different back then, as it had been in various permutations since 2018. In the mid-2020 version of the game, you squared off with Hades and, if you sent him packing, Zagreus would try to proceed onward into Greece, only to suddenly be torn asunder by some unseen force as he crossed the threshold. “Is there no escape?” text at the top of the screen would ask. Then Zag would awaken back in the old blood pool.This was a very bleak ending! As I did subsequent runs to see more character dialogue and unlock upgrades, Hades continually asked Zagreus why he even bothered; all that awaited him was an endless series of painful, pointless deaths. I spent probably 30 hours of game time with those stakes firmly in place. Zag would turn back the forces of hell, beat up his dickbag dad, and then die gruesomely as some invisible hand wrung him out like a dish towel. This put the hopelessness of the situation into stark focus. Zag was trapped in Hell in multiple senses: the physical location, sure, but also the pure misery that is doing something repeatedly in hopes of creating change, only to produce the same results every time.But this also forced the spotlight onto the tangible outcomes of Zagreus’ actions. Despite his deaths, the lives of those around him improved. The house of Hades did, too. I chose to make those improvements because I didn’t have much else to do with the resources I was amassing. But it felt good. It felt like an extension of who Zagreus had become while stuck in the blades of this nightmarish blender. The system Zagreus found himself trapped in was hopeless, but the situation was not. Life was not. It was an extremely powerful statement delivered through a combination of mechanics, narrative, and an incomplete game.I kinda wish that was still the ending. But due to the fickle nature of early access, that version of Hades no longer exists. A large chunk of the game I played is not the game people are playing now, but that portion indelibly colored my experience. The game I played told a different story that, intentionally or not, made a different point. Until, as of the full 1.0 release, it didn’t.In both early access and the 1.0 release, in addition to escaping from Hades, Zagreus also wants to find his long-lost mother, Olympian goddess Persephone. He didn’t even learn she was his mother until adulthood, long after she’d both secretly moved to and eventually fled the underworld. In the version of the game where Zagreus’ goal was unattainable, this didn’t matter all that much. It could have been anything else, but due to the structure of the game at the time, it would not have impacted what, in its absence, ended up feeling to me like the point of the story.In the 1.0 version of the game, after you defeat Hades, Zagreus leaves the confines of hell and finds Persephone. After a brief bit of long-overdue mother-son bonding, Zagreus becomes weak and dies. It turns out he can’t survive topside for long. The game then turns into a series of jaunts to the surface (assuming you’re able to defeat Hades each time) wherein Zagreus frantically scrambles to learn bits and pieces about why his mom left, what Hades stood to gain by hiding it from him, and how to get his mom to return to the underworld. I read most of these conversations as a doomed effort. Persephone had regrets, sure, but she liked the life and home she’d built for herself and did not seem to be in a hurry to get reacquainted with the lord of the dead. That was fine with me. My parents are divorced; when I was a kid, I wished more than anything that they’d get back together. In reality, they’d already stayed together longer than they should have for my sister and me, and it made them both miserable.In Hades’ release version, Persephone ends up returning with Zagreus to the underworld after you defeat Hades 10 times. The two of you hop into a small boat captained by Styx boatman-turned-item-salesman Charon, and the credits roll. It’s a nice moment. Then, in a post-credits scene, Persephone forces Hades to more or less own up to his bullshit. It all feels a little too tidy. Years of verbal and physical abuse, a colossal web of lies, a stoic belief that Hades knew best that ended up pushing everybody he cared about away, and leadership that caused a kingdom to crumble, and all his own son gets is a quick “Oh dip, my B”? Admittedly, it’s a bit more complicated than that, and Zag does hold Hades accountable for most of his wrongdoings. But when I first watched the scene play out, it still didn’t feel true to the otherwise nuanced nature of the game. Plus, questions remained unanswered: How would the other Olympian gods react to the illicit presence of one of their own in Hell? They’d waged earthshaking wars for less, after all.This ending was, to me, a grand anticlimax. Fortunately, Hades was not over. After beating Hades, you haven’t beaten Hades. After beating Hades 10 times, convincing Persephone to come home, and watching the credits roll, you haven’t beaten Hades. Even after the credits, the game goes on for hours and hours. While some players, myself included, have reached Hades’ final scene, they still haven’t puzzled out exactly what number of runs or other preconditions trigger it. But as with everything else in the game, it seems to be inevitable. You just have to keep making runs and talking to characters, who react to the sudden return of their queen. You just have to stick with it.(Major spoilers end here.)I cannot evaluate Hades without factoring in the period of time in which I played it. This is true for basically all games: How many classics have you spent years nostalgically pining for, only to realize upon finally replaying them that you were actually longing for a simpler time or circumstance? But I think this holds especially true for my read on Hades, both in terms of what resonated and what left me feeling a little conflicted.I first started playing Hades around the same time Black Lives Matter protests erupted across the nation. It feels like an eternity ago, at least in terms of the sense of possibility that gripped The Discourse at the time. It felt like people were really waking up to the bloody havoc police regularly wreak on Black people and the structural damage that communities endure so that police’s coffers can remain overstuffed. Perhaps more importantly, it seemed like Americans were no longer writing off alternative ideas about how to improve communities. Activists have advocated for abolition and defunding for at least as long as militarized police forces have existed, but earlier this year, it briefly felt like the moment they’d been fighting so hard for had finally arrived. Defunding became a mainstream talking point. It seemed like, perhaps, at least in Democratically-led cities, people could begin forcing fundamentally unjust systems into a shape that vaguely resembled justice.But, as we all know by now, things haven’t worked out that way. As the months drew on, police abuse of protesters continued unabated as major media organizations fixated on property damage instead of human lives and the police’s role in instigating violence. Far-right extremist militia members shot people and sought refuge among police ranks. Now we stand in the crosshairs of a Presidential election that seems poised to spark off even worse violence in the streets and potentially steal away whatever small semblance of democracy remains in this country.Hopelessness is in right now. How could it not be? People rose up, but the historically awful status quo rose higher. What is there left to do but go on Twitter and Facebook and post different variations of “We’re fucked” alongside whatever headline you read most recently? I’m a white guy in no present danger beyond what I subject myself to. Despite this, I spent a lot of the summer despairing.I will not go so far as to say Hades got me through it. At this point in my life, I am skeptical of games’ ability to do things of that magnitude. But as the summer wore on, Hades’ story of somebody refusing to despair in the face of overwhelming systemic failure and instead pivoting into helping rebuild his community and support his found family took on a new significance. I watched people much smarter than me talk about how hopelessness is useless, good causes are gaining ground in smaller ways, and no matter where you live, there are vitally important grassroots organizations that anybody can contribute to—people need only seek them out. I knew this logically, but that didn’t reassure me much. Hades helped me feel it.In the coming months and years, things are likely to get worse. But in recent times, Hades has given me some darn good days, and much more importantly, it’s helped me keep in mind that literally everybody is capable of giving somebody they’re close to—or just some rando, or a group of randos, or whatever—a couple of good days. In time, that can and hopefully will coalesce into something larger. In the meantime, it’s what we’ve got, and it’s not nothing.(Major spoilers begin here.)While sticking with Hades for what I thought was going to be an additional day but turned out to be an additional week of late-night “just one more run” sessions, I found the game’s epilogue—which unfolded in the same format as the regular game—to be much more complicated than its too-neat ending. During or after runs, Zagreus and Hades would regularly jaw back and forth about their broken relationship—both engaging, finally, in something resembling good faith, but with Hades continuing to insist that his actions were partially justified and his abusive habits were immutable. Meanwhile, Zagreus and Persephone tried to build a relationship, but it was clear that they had a lot of lost time to make up for.Still, when the game finally “ended,” it wrapped up with an optimistic but messy message about family, which you’d expect from a game starring famously dysfunctional Greek gods. By this point, Zagreus’ role within the house of Hades had also changed. Instead of trying to actually break out, he’d become an official staff member tasked with testing Hell’s defenses and keeping up appearances so that no nosy Olympian gods would come a-knocking. He’d more or less been assimilated into the broken system. He’d gained a seat at the table, but the status quo endured.It left me wondering if a game that needs you to be able to run through it infinitely could ever actually be about dismantling a structure, rather than reifying it. But Hades is a gargantuan game about many things. I can’t knock it too much for veering off course at the end, especially when what resonated most with me probably wasn’t even the final destination to begin with. Hades isn’t just a game about failure. It’s also about family, sacrifice, the lies people tell themselves, and a whole host of other subjects. It takes source material that is often quite dark and a central narrative that is very grim and comes out with something that is remarkably lighthearted. It’s a heck of a balancing act, but Hades pulls it off. Supergiant has managed, against all odds, to craft a Greek mythological tale that gives most characters a happy ending.(Major spoilers end here.)I’ve come to appreciate that optimism, especially now that I’ve gotten to watch many other people experience this fundamentally more hopeful version of the game than the one I first played. Hades and its cast of hot gods are giving players a much-needed reprieve from everything else. This dovetails nicely with the game’s own mechanical kindness; like Thanatos, the god of death who expresses his affection by giving you health-increasing hearts, Hades acts all distant and difficult at first, but it really just wants you to have everything your heart desires. It wants to help you achieve your goals at a pace that suits you.""After deliberating briefly, Cerberus concludes that, yes, he shall accept the sack.""Narrative-driven bad dad puncher.A multifaceted story that unfolds based on how you play, sublime combat that rewards experimentation, challenges that are only as difficult as you want them to be, all the good feelings of roguelikes without a lot of the hassle.Some late-game story stuff, other roguelikes are probably ruined for me now.Supergiant GamesPC (Played), Nintendo SwitchDecember 16, 2018 (early access), September 17, 2020 (version 1.0)90 hours of the PC version (50 or so while the game was in its final stages of early access)Yesterday, I tweeted about how it’s fun to watch people edge up against completing a run for the first time—saying they’re about to “beat” Hades—because they have no idea what they’re in for. One person replied by saying that “the actual best story of Hades is the one that the player has with their experience of the game.” It would, in the case of so many other games, be a banal observation, but in this case, it rings unusually true. Hades unfurls itself in what could be an infinite number of different configurations based on how you play—or, if we take early access into account, even when you played.It is so large and generous that it’s going to leave many different people with many different takeaways based on which characters and ideas they latch onto first or last or in the middle. Some will be longer-winded than mine, others will be as simple as “dash good” (and oh man, the dash is so, so good). This is not all to say that Hades tries to wriggle out of saying anything definitive. It says plenty no matter how you slice it. But a good story is in the telling, and Hades tells its story a little differently to everybody. It’s like a good myth, in that regard. Or a hydra, in that it has a lot of heads, but nobody can quite agree on exactly how many.In Hades, one of Greek myth’s most famous characters, the boulder-pushing Sisyphus, has a bit part. When he’s not eternally rolling a rock up a hill, he doles out items in the game’s first area, Tartarus. Despite his arduous, backbreaking lot in un-life, he comes across as blissfully cheerful—a ray of sunshine in the dank depths of Hades’ deepest chambers. Some players have observed that this is similar to a rumination on the character by philosopher and author Albert Camus, who in 1942 famously wrote that “one must imagine Sisyphus happy,” basically saying that if Sisyphus accepted the futility of his struggle—or at least, its lack of an inherent meaning or goal—he could find contentedness within it.In a Reddit AMA last week, Hades writer and designer Greg Kasavin said that this was not a deliberate nod, but added that it’s “pretty cool” that he and Camus arrived at similar conclusions. To me, this particular riff on Sisyphus naturally arises not just from the reality of his situation, but also, in Hades’ case, Zagreus’ story. Sisyphus serves as a sort of reflection, a microcosm of Zagreus’ own Sisyphean struggle and the contentedness he can find in accepting that, for the time being, he may not be able to break free from the hell that confines and defines his whole world, but he can still at the very least make small but meaningful improvements to the lives of those around him.The work never ends. Let’s get pushing.In Hades, each Infernal Arm you use to escape from Hell has its own unique abilities. The different Hades is amazing.

HADES REVIEW FOR PC AND NINTENDO SWITCH. As is now essentially tradition, developer Supergiant Giants has spent three years making a new game that is polished and filled to the brim with exciting content. Bastion (2011), Transistor (2014), Pyre (2017), and now Hades (2020) enjoy critical acclaim and hardcore support from fans. During its early access period, we could see that Hades was going to be something special, but wow has the 1.0 blown me away. This is the Game Revolution review.As with any Supergiant Games title, it’s the presentation that initially draws the player in. Hades looks visually stunning with a style that complements the Greek mythology it incorporates. The different levels of the underworld are clearly distinguished and populated with unique traps. Animations are smooth and combat visuals look awesome and dangerous.Hades tells a compelling story that also pushes the player towards multiple completions. Though it took me 14 hours to reach the ending, I must now complete it again to learn more, which I plan to do after hitting “Publish” on this review!The highlight, though, is the design of the gods that assist and hinder protagonist Zagreus as he attempts to escape hell, against the wishes of his father, Hades. Though they are stationary in appearance, each god oozes charisma with superb voice acting that covers hours and hours of dialogue. As a player, I look forward to meeting my favorite gods and developing a relationship for additional benefits. Before you know it, you’re immersed and loving it!Boons from the gods, as well many other items and buffs, will help Zagreus on his path through the underworld. Thankfully, Zagreus is already pretty powerful and fun to play as, with a host of different weapons that can really shake up the way he controls. As silly as it might sound, I found the shield and bow to be most satisfying in my 20+ hours of play, though I’m looking forward to using swords and spears as I put in countless more time.Combat is smooth and satisfying, with even the Nintendo Switch satisfying the 60 FPS frame-rate for the most part. Zagreus largely depends on dashing about the screen to avoid deadly blasts and benefits from invincibility frames that are a delight to master. Once there’s an opening to attack, Zag has three move types at his disposal, along with a devastating “Call” function that is unlocked after a few runs.The randomized Boons largely dictate which moves you’ll be using. While one run might see the player spamming Special attacks for the entire session, another might push Zag down a path of switching between Attack and Cast. For the most part, there is enough flexibility in the Boon choices to keep players feeling lethal, but you can sometimes be forced to use a less exciting build. This provides its own unique challenge but can make that particular run less fun. (Of course, you can always just hit “Give up” and try again.)Occurrences of a “bad build” are very rare, however, with Zag often enhanced beyond belief into an overpowered underworld-shattering specimen. Whether it’s from the lightning-charged buffs that Zeus provides or the “Drunk” status effects allowed by Dionysus, or any of the many gods in between, there’s always an exciting upgrade around the corner.In addition to Boons, Zag can find other items like coins, Centaur Hearts, Daedalus’ Hammers, and Pom of Powers to enjoy per-run buffs. These allow for more choices and enhancements to make each run more unique. What’s more, upon death Zag doesn’t totally reset. Permanent upgrades can be purchased using the Darkness currency, as well as Gemstones and an Ambrosia treat.It’s these permanent upgrades that will be a key focus in the early game, as Zagreus is likely to fall at the first boss. The next time around, he’ll have a better grasp on combat, additional health, and a new weapon. It’s the progression over the time that remains addicting, without becoming repetitive. Even after 100 hours, players will still be uncovering new ways to play and equipment combinations.The speed at which you can rise through the depths of hell also helps avoid the feeling of repetition. Though areas may become familiar, their layouts and enemy types are randomized. What took 20 minutes before may only take five with Zag’s new upgrades. Chasing Boons for your “ultimate build” powers an addiction that will have you replaying over and over again in the same session.Though the PC version can run at higher resolutions and frame-rates, it’s the Nintendo Switch edition that I’ve spent the most time with. It’s easy to put in a 30-minute session during a break, knowing that you’re going to kill hundreds of enemies and fight a bunch of bosses in quick succession, with no busywork to hold you back. Though you can sink in hundreds of hours, Hades still respects the player’s time.Provided you can handle the fast-paced combat that Hades throws at you, which can be a little stressful, this game is a must-play. Whether it’s on PC or Nintendo Switch, this title runs incredibly smoothly with god-tier responsiveness in controls. It’s Supergiant Games’ best title yet, which is saying something as I loved Bastion, and a serious Game of the Year 2020 contender.Hades takes the hated cycle of retrying the same checkpoint over and over again, flips it on its head with rewarding progression, and makes the player genuinely look forward to starting anew. There really is nothing like it with this level of polish and execution. Gods, it’s impressive!Hades was reviewed on PC (Ryzen 7 3700X, 32 GB RAM, RTX 2070) and Nintendo Switch with code provided by the publisher.Mack is slowly grinding his way to Level 100.

Hades,Jordan Devore,Destructoid,https://www.destructoid.com/stories/review-hades-603497.phtml,"darkThe buzz surrounding Hades is spot-on, and it only took one failed escape from hell for me to fall in love with its isometric hack-and-slash combat. It’s blisteringly fast but readable even when your screen is full of fiends. It’s easy to pick up but full of tough decisions. There are six weapons, all of which feel worthwhile, and countless god-given boons with which to improve and drastically alter them.If you’ve been holding out for the 1.0 release of Hades because you try to avoid messing with Early Access on principle or you wanted to wait for a proper conclusion to the story, the time has come.For all of 2020’s misery, I can’t believe how many incredible roguelikes this year has brought us.Hades (PC [reviewed], Nintendo Switch)Developer: Supergiant GamesPublisher: Supergiant GamesReleased: September 17, 2020MSRP: $24.99I’ve put something like 20 hours into Hades‘ final release, and I have no regrets – which is good considering I’m bound to double that tally. I keep trying to get Hades “out of my system,” but it’s unshakable. This is the culmination of everything Supergiant Games has been working toward.The secret sauce – aside from stellar action-RPG combat – is character-driven storytelling.As Zagreus, the defiant son of Hades, you’ll make a mad dash through Tartarus, Asphodel, and Elysium with hopes of reaching Greece and gaining insight. Along the way – during runs and also back home at your “base” of sorts – you’ll converse with legendary mythological figures, all of whom are voiced and full of personality in thoughtful ways. Rather than tell a linear story, Hades is dished out through morsels of conversation that fit the context of a world in which death is an inevitable inconvenience.It’s a perfectly-conceived setting for a roguelike, one that often feels alive by reacting to what you, the player, are up to – without coming across as artificial or “game-y.” These character interactions are wonderful. Supergiant’s carrot-on-a-stick story and repeatable game loop go hand in hand, and that takes the sting out of defeat. After mastering the default half-hour-or-so run, I feel motivated to keep playing, in large part, for more incremental story bits. At the same time, I’m still loving the flexible combat system and I’m pushing myself by toggling on some of the many endgame difficulty modifiers.There’s a lot of minutia in the background initially, to the point where Hades‘ first few hours run the risk of overwhelming players who are (understandably) curious about permanent upgrades. Several meta currencies can be used to improve your odds of breaking out of the underworld, and if you fixate up front – if you’re too concerned with “winning” as early as possible – you’ll be doing yourself a disservice.Win or lose, ultimately, you’ll be pulled back to the House of Hades. Zagreus is stuck in an endless loop, but life goes on. At home, you’ll run into bosses (even the Big Guy himself) that you potentially fought and slayed on your last run, with no hard feelings – chances are they’ll have something interesting to say about it. You might chat up Achilles, pet Cerberus, or train with Skelly, and be on your way again.In other words, Hades rewards every attempt. The main narrative concerning Zagreus, Hades, and Persephone will start coming into focus as you continuously teach your old man a lesson, but the personal stories – including friendships and romances – can and will play out in spite of botched runs.What if you don’t care to engage with that side of Hades outside of the bare minimum? The good news is that it’s still a ridiculously fun, well-balanced action-RPG experience, and you won’t be bogged down by dialogue. After 20 hours, I still enjoy beating up the most basic creeps. That says something.There are three full biomes, the first two of which are an eternal pleasure to burn through and the third of which sometimes has slight pacing issues depending on your build and how equipped you are to handle waves of enemies that need to be killed twice to truly die. A fourth zone, the Temple of Styx, serves as a smaller choose-your-own-adventure “time to stock up for the final boss” buffer. It’s all right.Within these biomes, you’ll fight monsters or chat with friendly faces on a room-by-room basis rather than explore a continuous stretch of land. In most cases, there are two choices – you can pick which room to enter next and you’ll plainly see what reward is going to be up for grabs (once you learn what each symbol means). Later, with an upgrade, you can even re-roll rewards if you don’t like the selection.At first, I was expecting more of an exploration vibe from Hades – it’s almost non-existent – but I grew to appreciate the straight-to-the-action structure. That makes it a joy to replay and grind for upgrades.Speaking of which, expect to die a lot until you’ve made permanent purchases with the Mirror of Night in your bedroom. These unlocks can give you benefits like an extra dash, more longevity – including, at most, three “extra lives” on each run – and also boost your odds of seeing higher-tier boons pop up.Boons are frequently doled out as a reward for clearing rooms, and they’re your chance to hear a message from the gods of Olympus, each of whom has a gameplay-specific area of expertise. Athena can help you deflect projectiles back at their source, Zeus has lightning chains, and Chaos will offer a range of powerful perks in exchange for a harsh temporary debuff. Boons are used to create and modify your build on the fly for the duration of your current run; they’re my favorite part of Hades by far.Each boon can branch off in a few different initial directions, and those directions can further mix and match and be upgraded as your run progresses. I can’t oversell how satisfying these abilities become. There’s rarely a clear-cut best choice – everything has potential, and I never quite know where my character build will take me. I can’t say the same for most other action-leaning roguelike games.Going a step further, every weapon – from the Eternal Spear to the Adamant Rail (gun) to the Shield of Chaos – has hidden “aspects” that you can permanently unlock to specialize your playstyle. I’m obsessed with the Heart-Seeking Bow and its ability to “tag” a target with my main arrow and then fire off a spread of homing shots from a safe distance. I love powering that up with assists from uncle Zeus.Zagreus also has a metered ability (based on the different gods) that you can charge up throughout battles and there are finite spell-like projectiles that you can “stick” in enemies, recover, and fire off again. Without breaking down every mechanic, let’s just say combat is fluid, dynamic, and full of life.Discovering synergies just doesn’t seem to get old. Effects stack up in delightfully powerful ways.For those of us who adore a capital-g Grind, this one delivers. Supergiant gives ample opportunities to accumulate meta currencies during dungeon runs, and you can even trade them (to get precisely what you need) back home. I was able to easily prioritize and work toward the specific unlocks I wanted.If anything bummed me out in Hades, I’d probably point to unevenness in the latter two zones, which sometimes feel like I’m going through the motions, and an arguable missed opportunity for a larger boss roster. Supergiant designed several genuinely memorable (and highly replayable) fights, but it leaned a bit too heavily on variants. They don’t all shake things up as much as I would’ve liked.At the same time, those criticisms stand out to me mostly because everything else is so excellent. If you’ve enjoyed this studio’s other games, for what it’s worth, I’d call Hades the best of the bunch. And if you’re worried about hitting a brick wall and potentially missing the big-picture story moments, don’t be afraid to turn on the “God Mode” toggle for a guilt-free defensive boost to help you defeat dear dad.Hades had the unenviable task of bridging a well-established action-roguelike format with impactful character-driven storytelling, and neither element feels like an afterthought. They lift each other to new heights. The finer details – all those little artistic touches that add up over time – really seal the deal.It’s hard to imagine anyone other than Supergiant pulling off this Herculean feat with such style.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]SuperbA hallmark of excellence. There may be flaws, but they are negligible and won't cause massive damage.

Hades,TJ Denzer,Shacknews,https://www.shacknews.com/article/120582/hades-review-godlike-roguelike,"New to Shacknews? Signup for a Free AccountAlready have an account? Login NowWe got our Greek on and went rampaging through the Underworld in Hades, but is this mythology-inspired roguelike truly godly or cursed by hubris?Hades was an altogether different kind of thing for Supergiant Games, who has, at this point, made a habit of exploring new spaces with each outing. The studio is no stranger to isometric and stylized games though, but where Pyre was a sort of sports story, Transister was RPG intensive, and Bastion was a action with a singular route, Hades is a shifting and contorting roguelike. Despite the nature of difficulty and randomness of these games, Supergiant has found a way to tell an engrossing narrative filled to the brim with good music, enjoyable progression, and vividly enjoyable depictions of the ancient Greek pantheon and its heroes and villains.No, it’s true. Hades is a roguelike with a good story to tell. As Zagreus, son of Hades who was born and raised in the Underworld, you’ve had enough of your life in the Halls of the Dead. And so Zagreus plots to escape. Hades doesn’t exactly try to stop his son because he’s a busy man with countless souls of the deceased to judge. Also, the Underworld is a shifting series of realms full of angry souls that will go out of their way to kill anyone who tries to leave. And if Zagreus dies… well, where is he going to go? Florida? Nope, he spawns right back in his old man’s home to begin the journey again.What sets Hades apart immediately from other roguelikes like it is that death has context to push the story forward just a little bit each time. Your home base of sorts in Hades’ home is filled to the brim with an expanding cast of characters that share unique conversation with Zagreus every time he returns. Among them are the Underworld lord Hades himself, three-headed-heck-guard-doggo-turned-best-boy Cerberus (yes, Cerberus has dialogue and will let you give him pets, the almost-immortal warrior and teacher Achilles, the motherly Nyx, and more. Everyone has something new to share with Zagreus if (when) he comes home.It’s not confined to Hades’ hall either. Out in the battlefields of Tartarus, Asphodel, and more, the other Greek gods of Olympus will send Zagreus messages and aid to empower him on his journey. He can also run into rooms where mythological figures like the boulder-rolling Sisyphus and the tragic nymph Eurydice await to speak with and aid him as well. Even the bosses in Hades are characters with ongoing narrative with the prince each time he meets them. And perhaps even more interesting is that the narrative with all of these characters can sometimes depend on whether you’ve defeated them, been killed by them, brought a certain weapon with you, taken the aid of a certain deity, and more. It all comes together to make Hades one of the most story-rich roguelikes I have ever seen, and often satisfying even in my continuous bouts of dying and trying again.It has to be said that this is all set to Supergiant Games’ arguably best soundtrack yet. Composer Darren Korb has put together an awesome arrangement of music that adapts to the players situation, feels mellow or chill when it needs to be, and hair-raising intense and dramatic when in the throes of a battle to the death. It moves back and forth between these situations well and also features some haunting lyrical melodies set to unique situations. Supergiant Games have always had good music and Hades’ soundtrack is no exceptionStory-hefty nature aside, Hades is still functionally a roguelike. What that means is that you’ll go through a randomized series of rooms on your way to a boss fight in a region before moving up to the next region. Each room has a different reward associated with it that you’ll gain if you defeat its conditions (or its just a lucky room with no danger). These rewards will be seen in orbs over the doors leading to that room for you to strategically choose. They can be upgrades for your weapon, messages and aid from a certain god (called boons), upgrades for your godly boons, dark gems to boost Zagreus’ stats, coins to spend at a shop run by Charon, and more.The boons and weapon upgrades are probably the most important. There are up to six different weapons you can unlock in the game, but you can only take one with you when you begin a run. Daedalus Hammers are the weapon upgrades and they offer you a choice of bonuses, such as making the Stygian Blade break armor faster with its regular attack or making the Aegis shield bounce between and hit targets when thrown before returning. Each weapon has a large list of upgrades that can come from the Daedalus Hammer to make it more versatile.Much like the Daedalus Hammer and the various weapons, each god found in your journey has a series of power-ups associated with them if you find their messages. For instance, Poseidon’s boons can grant water powers that knock enemies away or increase your treasures where Athena’s boons will grant defensive traits such as resistance to damage or reflecting attacks back at enemies.Each boon will be associated with your basic attack, special attack, projectile, or dash, or a passive that affects them all, and mix and matching the gods’ abilities with those of your weapon upgrades makes for countless possibilities that can lead to easier conquests out of Hades’ domain. I tended to enjoy the Aegis shield or Varatha spear with Ares’ Doom boons, which cause enemies to take a burst of damage shortly after being attacked and marked, mixed with a projectile reflection dash from Athena, and a chained lightning projectile attack from Zeus. That said, there’s also a degree of randomness to it, you take what you can get from the choices you’re given, and there are a ton of viable combinations to explore.As a roguelike, many players should know there is a certain level of difficulty associated with a game like Hades. If you lose, you don’t just go back to a checkpoint. You go back to the very start of the journey, meaning if you made it to the final boss (which can take about 30 to 50 minutes to do) and fall right at the finish line… tough luck, chump. Go back to the beginning. The advancing narrative as you go makes it easier to deal with, but it can still be frustrating to start all over again. At the same time, you get stronger constantly and the journey becomes naturally easier with enough runs. In this regard, Supergiant Games adds something that I highly appreciate and many other players will too: options to both soften and toughen the difficulty of the game.Hades has a God Mode that makes the game easier and a Hell Mode that makes the game harder. God Mode isn’t what you might think from something like Doom. It doesn’t make you invincible because then you would miss out on a lot of Hades’ narrative. Instead, every time you die, the game adds a stack of damage resistance to Zagreus that makes enemy attacks hit a little less hard each time. Die enough, and they’ll be barely scratching you where they once maimed you, making for an altogether easier run. God Mode can also be toggled off and on at any time through a normal save, allowing you to use it at your leisure.Conversely, Hell Mode makes use of the Pact of Punishment that can be gained after players defeat a run. In normal games, the Pact of Punishment can be used to set different conditions like enemies doing more damage, making more enemies appear, and raising the prices of Charon’s shop, with the benefit of better rewards. In Hell Mode, the Pact of Punishment is available from the start and there are difficulties selected from the list that are mandatory, including one unique to Hell Mode that removes the temporary damage invincibility upon being hit, essentially allowing Zagreus to be struck again immediately. A Hell Mode save also disables the ability to activate God Mode, which is smart and cheeky. Where Pact of Punishment is cool as a new game plus, it’s also cool that players looking for a challenge can go all-in with Hell Mode from the get-go.Hades is another banger from Supergiant Games. That’s a fact. Throughout the entire journey there was little I could find to be mad at other than failing in my quest close to the finish line or getting a bad combination of power-ups that didn't work well together, but God Mode was there for me to soften the quest if I so desired. The game’s performance slowed a bit in rooms where there were a lot of enemies at once, but otherwise it was buttery smooth throughout. The mix of boons and upgrades provides delightful flexibility, the advancing and adapting narrative upon dying or succeeding keeps things interesting throughout, and the soundtrack is something I will continue to listen to inside and outside the game for just how ridiculously good it is. Whether you’re looking for a challenging action game or just want to enjoy a beautifully illustrated and orchestrated story, Hades might be my preferred recommendation for romps through Hell.This review was based on a digital Nintendo Switch copy provided by the publisher.

					TJ Denzer posted a new article, Hades review: Godlike roguelike 
					I feel REALLY broken.I absolutely love the genre but could never get into this game 				
					At least you still have DQ11				
					Man I love that game, but I think I'm over the combat, 55 hours of it is all I can takeI ended at a grind wall, requiring 2-3 hours of level grinding to beat a boss, nope. Maybe I'll dive back in next year. 				
					I am currently at such a wall myself and set it down. I don't like feeling obligated to play a game 				
					did you try it when it hit 1.0? because playing an early access vs a 1.0 is a massive difference...				
					I think so, I played it earlier this year 				
					Hades v1.0 actually only just hit recently on September 17. It's been in Early Access for most of this year.				
					Woops thought we were talking about DQ haha! Maybe I should give it another shot 				
					bro 1.0 just came out, right when it came out on switch. like 1 or 2 weeks ago				
					The experience is not going to be much different from when you played. It’s even more polished than it already was and they added lots of stuff but it’s basically the same as it was in January. 				
					[deleted]				
					Hmmm  				
					I read that as Godzilla roguelike and hopped that fuckin' link. Nope. This is not what I came to find.				
					My apologies. There are, unfortunately, no iconic kaiju in this roguelike action game about Greek mythology. Maybe in the DLC...				
					As long as they have Megan, I'm set				
					Fuck, Negan. Thanks autocorrect				
					I suddenly want to plot my trek through America getting Godzilla upgrades and smashing Trump/Maralago! Make it realistic with current conditions, some wear masks some dont. 				
					Trying to sus out information about this game without going directly to videos, screens, etc.so I can kind of go into it as a surprise. If I loved Dead Cells will I like this game too? 				
					Absolutely yes.				
					I had a quick run this morning and it is incredible, can't wait to play more.				"
Hades,William Schwartz,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/hades-review/,"There’s not much that can be said about Hades at this point that hasn’t been said.  Last year, Supergiant’s Hades came out of early access to critical acclaim, rocketing up many game of the year lists to close out the 2020 and it was well deserved praise.  While Supergiant has carved out a niche for themselves with their highly stylized isometric titles, the developer seems to have taken the lessons learned from Bastion, Transistor, and Pyre to put forth their best effort yet with Hades.A rouge-like dungeon crawling ARPG, Hades is a breath of fresh air for a genre that has been well tread over the last few years.  The marks of a near perfect game, Hades excels in just about every area: Gameplay, Art Style, Music, Presentation… the game is teeming with personality and style and it’s just a lot of fun to play.Supergiant takes lessons learned from previous games to put forth their best effort yetWhile last year’s release was limited to the PC and Switch, Hades is finally making it’s way to the PlayStation and Xbox consoles, while also debuting to a massive audience on Game Pass.  The good news is that Hades hasn’t changed all that much in this release.  It has translated over to the new consoles with little lost to the naked eye.  In fact, if just for the matter of convenience, Hades was a blast to dig back into on my PlayStation 5 on my big screen. If you like rogue likes, you don’t need to read much further.  Hades is a near perfect example of this type of game.  It’s hard to imagine anyone who enjoys this type of experience to turn away unsatisfied with Hades.You play as Zagreus the defiant son of Hades who wants out of the Underworld.For those who want a bit more, Hades is as described previously an action role playing game set within the constraints of a rogue-like formula.  Like modern games in this genre there are plenty of persistent upgrades that’ll keep you playing, but each run is one which you can “beat” the game using the random power-ups and abilities that are thrown at you during said run.  The persistent abilities and unlocks that you earn over time will make things a little easier.In Hades you play as Zagreus, the prince of the Underworld and the defiant son of Hades.  His quest is to leave the underworld at the dismay of his father, in search of his mother Persephone.  Along the way, Zagreus is aided by the Olympians who offer him powerful boons that allow him to fight through four levels of the underworld.  Like other games by Supergiant, this is an isometric title.  Each room that Zagreus clears offers him distinct benefits for doing so, whether that’s power-ups from the Olympians, currency to purchase items to help, or persistent items that can be spent on upgrades that allow for Zagreus to grow stronger.  Each level is end-capped by a powerful boss.  Fighting your way to the surface is your goal and to do so you’ll need to face four distinctly challenging levels and said bosses who roadblock that progress.  Zagreus has a slew of unlockable weapons that he can use to take on this challenge.While it doesn’t sound much different than many others rogue-like titles, Hades most certainly feels different when you dig in.  Unlike many games of this type, Supergiant succeeds in presenting a compelling narrative and an interesting cast of characters.  Something that is often missing in games of this type.  Each time that Zagreus fails in his attempt to make it to Greece, he’ll have the opportunity to build relationships with the many underworld inhabitants.  Nyx, Achilles, Medusa, and more will be there to lend there advice to Zagreus on his quest.  Build said relationships and you’ll earn powerful keepsake items that help you on your quest.  It’s a tale that’s masterfully told by Supergiant.  The relationship between Zagreus and his father, the Olympians and the inhabitants of the underworld is one that shows a level of dysfunction that is hardly represented in the source material and lends a level of a relatability to the cast of characters.  Never have we seen a rogue-like game with such a strong narrative base as we see with Hades.The compelling narrative of Hades is not often seen in other rogue-likesAnd it’s backed up in the gameplay department as well.  Hades is as enjoyable a dungeon crawler as any.  While it may feel a bit mashy if you get lucky enough to build one of the game’s many OP builds, for the most part the combat is both challenging and fun.  Most rooms have branching paths which allow you to pick up different upgrades for your character so no run ever really feels the same.  There are a number of Olympians that offer Boons to Zagreus and builds can go in any number of directions on any given run.  That’s part of the fun of Hades.  It’s a “what will I get this time” sort of game.  There’s plenty of games like this, but some of them just aren’t that fun when you don’t get decent weapons or abilities.  With Hades, you can pick a weapon that you like at the start and then build around that weapon.  Over the long haul you can unlock special power-ups for said weapons, and if you really dig into the game you can unlock hidden upgrades and attributes for each weapon by fostering your relationships with the cast of characters in this game.  Hades is good built on good, built on good.  From the core gameplay to the narrative, to the unlockables, modifiers and more… everything feels organically implemented for you to unlock and unfold.  While most rogue-like titles have zero pacing, Hades has this incredible pace to the game that always feels like you’re working towards something.  And it’s almost always more than a feeling.  As you get stronger, you can’t help but make it further and further on your journey.Supergiant has always been known for their incredible attention to the small details of their games and they’ve haven’t yet released a game yet that hasn’t had both a rocking soundtrack and stellar voice cast.  Hades is no different. Once again, the cast of characters who voice this dysfunctional underworld family are incredible and the music is once again a high point for the experience.  The level design and art style make this world come to life in a way that you just haven’t experienced in this Greek mythos before.  The tales and the characters are familiar for any that have delved into Greek mythology, but the way that they are introduced to the player are in such a way that make the content feel fresh.  Hades puts many games to shame, frankly.  Big or small.  There are just so many small details that are there simply to hammer home that artisanal feel.  Hades feels like it was made with loving care for each and every aspect of it.Look, if you have Game Pass this should be the first thing you play the moment it releases.  The amount of enjoyment that you’re likely going to get out of it is going to cover at least a month of your subscription to the service.  That said, Game Pass or not, Hades is a game that you just shouldn’t miss.  Whatever you like games for, graphics, gameplay, fun factor, it’s got this all in spades with equally exceptional quality wherever you choose to play it. If Hades got past you last year for whatever reason, don’t let it get by you again.
Attack of the Fanboy / GAME REVIEWS / Hades Review"
Hades,Mick Fraser,God is a Geek,https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/hades-nintendo-switch-review/,"September 17, 2020One of the main reasons Hades stands head and shoulders above many other roguelite action-RPGs is the progression system. Yes, it’s a hard game – rage-inducingly so, at times – but it balances that with a constant sense of progression and achievement that newer, more modern roguelites overlook or deliberately ignore. Like Dead Cells, Hades rewards you for failure, encouraging you to go back for that one-more-try, because it might be the one that leads to you unlocking a new weapon or power up that makes the next run easier or, at least, different.It doesn’t have the same variety of weaponry and gear as some of its peers, but Hades offers a unique weapon upgrade system that always feels worth pursuing but still resets with each run. Of course, it helps to be reviewing the 1.0 version of a title that has been in early access for several years. Hades has been consistently worked on, tweaked and refined by Supergiant Games, a developer who already had immense pedigree from the success of Transistor and Bastion, and the result is a title that may be easier to get to grips with, but is no less complex or challenging in the long run.Having proved a success on PC, Hades is finally moving over to the Nintendo Switch, a platform that seems almost custom built for titles like it. An isometric dungeon crawler, Hades casts you as Zagreus, the son of the titular god, as he attempts to escape the Underworld and reach Mount Olympus, where the rest of the Greek Pantheon awaits him. But it’s not that simple, and reaching Olympus is the test for entry, as all the horrors of the Underworld stand in his path.An interesting, surprisingly intricate plot is weaved between repeated delves into the netherrrealm, and sees Zagreus uncover godly conspiracies and unravel a web of lies about his heritage. The other gods, Zeus, Poseidon, Artemis, Athena, Ares, Hermes and Dionysius make an appearance throughout each run, offering power-ups and boons that increase your stats and attack power, or add special elemental effects to your attacks. Each seems more than happy to help Zagreus ascend, but some have motives of their own.The story progresses even through your failures, with new story beats and interactions occurring even when you don’t feel like you’re getting anywhere, and items you take out of the Dungeons, even on death, help to improve your fortunes in future runs. Some of them simply allow you to upgrade Hades’ Palace with new furnishings, rooms and items that serve little purpose beyond the cosmetic.Each run is broken into a series of rooms filled with enemies to defeat. When everything is dead, you’ll be presented with a door showing the rewards for the next room. For example, keys are used to unlock new weapons and buffs, Pomegranates (Poms) of Power boost a weapons skill, coins indicate a meeting with the ferryman Charon, who operates as a merchant. You can also earn HP increases and collect Darkness essence which is used as a currency to apply buffs between runs.If a door shows the symbol of a specific god, you can expect a bonus related to that god. For example, Ares increases melee damage or adds effects to those attacks, while Hermes increases attack speeds and your Dash moves. It’s an interesting system that keeps your buffs and boosts consistent yet still randomised. Sometimes you’ll need to choose between several gods, and the one you don’t pick will take offence, offering fewer or less effective buffs next time.It sounds obvious but the combat is the star of the show in Hades. There’s a variety of weapons to choose from, including the starting broadsword, a spear with a long reach, a bow, and a shield you can bash enemies with or throw. Each weapon had a primary and secondary attack that can be upgraded during the run, but which reset on death. You also have a dash move for evading danger, and a ranged attack that you can imbue with various properties like your weapons. Combat is fast and responsive, and feels as rewarding on the Switch as it does on PC. The final kill in a room will always hit in slow motion right before the reward appears with a pop! and it’s insanely satisfying every time.With a mix of melee and ranged enemies, some that drop mines or throw bombs, others still that fire lasers or can jump across the map, you’ll be forced to learn the intricacies of each weapon to survive. Thankfully Hades tends not to overly punish you for death. Not only are there buffs and items you can equip to grant second or even third lives, but you get plenty of chances to refill your HP or earn currencies for permanent improvements. And besides, Zagreus himself is just a joy to play as.His sharp wit and quick tongue have been honed by a lot of updates, and he has an answer or comment for every eventuality. When he crawls out of the mire at the start of each new run he’ll complain about the enemy it boss that killed him or the area he died in, and he responds to power-ups or events in each dungeon with little asides and subtle quips. His demeanour is dry and somewhat aloof, but it’s entertaining, and his relationships with the other gods – even the mysterious Chaos god who shows up now and then with double-edged gifts – are well written and often funny. Oh, and giving them gifts you find during your runs allows you to explore their individual stories, leading to special events specific to each God – as well as giving you a few extra items to equip for bonuses during subsequent escape attempts. Get really friendly and they’ll let you summon them during fights for devastating damage.Characters you find in and out of the Dungeons can help too, giving you gear and services – and in exchange for gifts they may give you items to equip, all of which can also be upgraded. You’ll only be able to equip one at a time though, so choose wisely. At a glance, Hades build system seems simple, but there’s immense depth to it if you can survive long enough.The version on Switch is up to date with all the updates and additions on PC so far. With Version 1.0 launching on Steam and the Epic Store, there’s a bunch of new stuff including a new Claw-class weapon and various tweaks to boss behaviour and, notably, the endgame. Having not spent a lot of time with Hades on PC it’s hard to comment too much on the effect of these changes, but as a whole Version 1.0 of Hades is a fantastic experience on PC or Nintendo Switch.Add to this the incredible score, so subtle you won’t even notice that you’re nodding your head or tapping your feet while slashing monsters into pieces, and the gorgeous art style that almost feels “typically Supergiant” and it’s not hard to see why Hades is universally praised. The Nintendo Switch version is not noticeably downgraded when played handheld, but you can see it when the Switch is docked. It’s not quite as sharp, and the framerate isn’t quite as smooth, but really you lose nothing in the incredible gameplay.With cross save, players who usually play on PC can carry on their adventures on the Switch, which is a fantastic addition on top of everything else. If anything, it would be nice to have the option to increase text size or zoom the screen on the Switch, as the action can happen fast and it’s not always easy to track in handheld.There’s a wonderful lightheartedness to a lot of Hades that can, every now and then, take a darker turn. The atmosphere is on point, the music is excellent, and the gameplay itself is incredibly satisfying. For a roguelite it’s surprisingly giving in terms of buffs, progression, and player aids, which will make it much more accessible for newcomers. While the Switch version doesn’t utilise the touchscreen controls or offer anything “new” that the PC version doesn’t, it’s still absolutely worth grabbing if you have the chance. Utterly addictive and endlessly playable, with a late game element that will keep you coming back for a very long time, Hades is simply one of the best and most likeable roguelites available on PC or Nintendo Switch.Superb combat

Hades,Diego Perez,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/hades-1-0-full-release-pc-switch-review/,"Supergiant Games is known for creating amazing narrative-driven adventures, so when they first announced they were making a roguelike, an early access roguelike no less, I was skeptical. Roguelikes have told decent stories in the past, but I didn’t think the Supergiant style of storytelling would work well in a roguelike setting. Hades proved me wrong. Now that the game is out of early access and finally complete, Hades is one of Supergiant’s best works. Not only do the roguelike elements keep the combat feeling fresh for dozens of hours, but they also tie into the narrative in surprising ways and make the story much more compelling as a result. Hades is one of the best roguelikes I’ve played in a long time, and I can’t wait to jump back in and see what else the game has in store.You play as Zagreus, Prince of the Underworld, who is hell-bent on running away from home to join the Gods on Mount Olympus. The only problem is that Zagreus’ father, the titular Hades, does not approve of his escape, so he must fight his way through Hades’ domain in order to get out. Hades is a dangerous place, so Zagreus faces death again and again, hoping to get lucky at least once. As you reach higher levels of Hades, you’ll learn more about Zagreus and his relationship with his father and the other residents of the House of Hades. These character relationships and Zagreus’ mysterious motivations are at the core of the game, which is odd for a roguelike. There is still plenty of action packed combat and randomized items to pursue, but Hades places equal emphasis on fleshing out its characters and world. Its heavy focus on story places Hades in a unique position within the genre, making it a refreshing change of pace right from the start.Supergiant’s transition to the roguelike genre is more than just a gameplay change. The repetition and randomness that permeate the genre are used to tell Hades’ story, and it makes this mythological tale all the more engaging. In Hades, death is a plot device. Zagreus is determined to escape the House of Hades no matter how many times his endeavors may kill him, and he reawakens in Hades’ domain each time you fail a run. His numerous deaths start to wear on him and those around him, and death is one of the driving forces behind the game’s story.The random items and bonuses you obtain during runs are also explained within the context of the story. The Gods of Mount Olympus see Zagreus as family and want to aid him on his quest, so they send all sorts of boons to the underworld to support him. These boons come with dialogue and story tidbits, which add an extra layer of uniqueness to the buffs they provide and make them feel like more than just numbers and percentages. Rather than having the gameplay and story exist on two separate planes, Hades’ gameplay and story are interwoven to the benefit of both departments. Many were skeptical of Supergiant making a roguelike when this game was first announced, but now it is clear that Hades could not have been anything other than a roguelike.In Hades, death is a plot device.If you normally bounce off of roguelikes, then Hades could be the one you fall in love with. The disheartening defeats of those first few runs are offset by charming characters and a desire to see the story through to the end. In the beginning, failure comes frequently and death comes swiftly, but you don’t feel as bad about it because you get to check back in with Achilles, Nyx, and the rest of the gang before you brave the depths of Tartarus once more. It’s not just the friendly faces that keep you going, either. Hypnos will tease you regularly and your father Hades does not take kindly to your multiple escape attempts. It’s the perfect blend of positive reinforcement and snide remarks that make you want to keep going on your seemingly futile quest. When you add new weapon unlocks and other upgrades on top of that, death transforms from a frustrating punishment to a promising opportunity to grow stronger. There are enough elements pulled from Supergiant’s other games that if you’re a fan of the developer, you should absolutely check this game out even if you’re not into roguelikes.Combat is fast and frenetic. It starts out simple, but the basic hacking and slashing at the core of Hades actually has a surprising amount of depth. You have a dash, a light attack, a heavy special attack, and a ranged cast attack. What separates Hades from other action games like it is its focus on positioning. Attacks from behind deal bonus damage, and the amount of bonus damage increases as Zagreus grows stronger, further incentivizing you to use your dash to flank your foes. Knocking enemies into walls is another core aspect of Hades, and learning to incorporate this into your playstyle can greatly increase your damage output. There are also traps scattered throughout the game’s arenas, and while you’ll accidentally stumble onto pressure plates and trigger spike traps all the time during your first few runs, you’ll eventually learn to use them to your advantage, adding yet another layer onto an already complex combat system.What separates Hades from other action games like it is its focus on positioning.There are multiple weapons to learn and master, but most of the combat variety comes from the many different boons and items you can acquire during runs. Boons are acquired at a steady pace throughout a run, but the ones you get are random each time. Boons from each God are centered around different things, and you’ll quickly learn which Gods fit your playstyle and which you’ll want to avoid. Zeus’ boons cause your attacks to chain lightning to nearby foes, for example, while Artemis’ boons focus more on critical damage. Mixing and matching different boons can result in some borderline broken builds. I was able to get through the entire second area and most of the third area on one of my earlier runs just because I had a ridiculous set of boons and upgrades. Each run in Hades feels very different from the last.On PC, the game’s beautiful art style really shines. The game doesn’t take much power to run and is incredibly optimized, so you can easily bump up the resolution and framerate if you have a fancy display. At both high resolutions and high framerates, Hades is absolutely stunning. The hand-drawn backgrounds and character portraits are gorgeous and the game never fails to be a joy to look at. On Nintendo Switch, the game holds close to it’s 60 FPS target at native resolution, but will slow down during effect heavy battles with multiple enemies. It never becomes unplayable, but it can make death during those rare moments feel cheap. A little more work can be done, but like Dead Cells at launch, the performance on Switch is not enough to completely detract from an otherwise outstanding experience.Hades is an excellent roguelike that appeals to both fans of the genre and newcomers alike. Roguelike veterans will appreciate the combat’s breakneck pace and the replayability offered by the randomized boons and items, while newcomers will have several charming characters and an interesting story to keep them going between runs. Of course, it’s difficult to tell if the game has staying power this soon after launch. Only time will tell if Hades joins the pantheon of roguelike greats alongside The Binding of Isaac and Dead Cells, but it makes an incredibly strong impression. Hades succeeds as both a narrative-driven adventure and an addicting roguelike, and that’s a pretty tough combination to pull off.

Genre: RogueliteWhen Hades first launched in 2020 for PC and Switch, I initially held off. The word “roguelike” usually makes me want to claw my skin off my body and run in the opposite direction. For me, the word inspires visions of endless dungeons, lost progress and a sense of patience I typically do not possess. However, I couldn’t resist the draw of developer Supergiant Games’ pedigree and signature art style on a next-gen console. After many, many attempts to escape the underworld, I’m hooked. Hades is a challenging game that will send you straight to hell again and again. But with such an interesting cast of characters and a compelling upgrade system, death doesn’t have to be a punishment. Read our full Hades review for more information.As you might have gathered from the title, Hades leans heavily on Greek mythology. You play as Zagreus, whose dad, Hades, just happens to be the king of the underworld. In a typical act of youthful rebellion, Zagreus desperately wants to escape the land of the dead and find his long-lost relatives on Mount Olympus. You’ll meet several of these familiar faces throughout the game: gods like Zeus, Hermes and Aphrodite make appearances from time to time, to help you on your quest.The underworld comprises four themed dungeons, though the actual number of rooms and encounters varies from run to run. Each room contains various enemies doing everything in their power to stop you from progressing. You’ll fight off detached skulls, gorgons, vermin, chariots and dozens of other foes, with the difficulty steadily increasing. Every run through a dungeon is different, but each section ends with a major boss fight that will put all of your skills to the test.Whether you prefer a melee or ranged approach, the various weapons in Hades let you tailor the combat to your own personal hack-and-slash fighting style. Sword, gauntlet, spear, bow — no matter which weapon you choose, you’ll have regular and special attacks, as well as a magic “cast” that shoots projectiles at foes. These weapons are adequate on their own, but reach their full potential only with Boons from visiting Olympians. These Boons might make attacks more powerful, add area effects, deflect enemy fire, or even let you summon the gods' strength for a moment or two. Choosing Boons carefully is key to success, and it makes Hades’ combat feel more strategic than simply hacking and slashing.That said, even if your favorite weapon receives favorable boosts from the gods, you’re going to die. A lot. It can be daunting, and even frustrating, to be sent back to the House of Hades after a particularly good run, but every death opens up new possibilities. You can purchase new skills, have revealing conversations, equip different accessories, switch up your weapons, and even pay for strategic and cosmetic upgrades. You can also check in on your adorable pet, the three-headed guard dog Cerberus, who’s a very good boy.At first, escaping the underworld feels like a Sisyphean task (quite literally, since you might encounter Sisyphus on your journey). But after defeating Megaera at the end of the first biome, Tartarus, things start to click. You’ll have a better sense of how to use weapons effectively, and which Boons best enhance your gameplay style. You’ll balance keeping your health up with collecting chthonic keys, darkness, gemstones and nectar, which are various forms of underworld currency, used to unlock abilities and upgrades. You’ll get a little further during each run, until Olympus is practically within reach.Then you’ll die again.You’ll get up, wipe the blood off, and try again.My one major annoyance in Hades was having to repeat the same boss battles over and over. I know that permadeath and losing progress are a big part of roguelike design. But after battling it out with Meg and her sisters a dozen times over, that boss fight became a real drag. I wish there was some way to spend darkness or some other currency to skip bosses you’ve already defeated, which would also take a bit out of the string out of the many, many deaths.Of course, dying repeatedly is a little easier to swallow when a game looks as good as Hades. Supergiant’s games are known for their incredible art styles, and this one is no exception. Despite its hellish themes, Hades is actually quite colorful, with masterfully hand-drawn artwork. I’m sure it looks gorgeous on any platform, but it really pops on the PlayStation 5. Everything about the presentation is close to perfect, from the graphics, to the dialogue and music, to the buttery smooth animation that never misses a beat.Hades is one of the few games that can make losing all of your progress feel like a fresh opportunity. Even if (like me) you don’t typically go for roguelikes, it’s nearly impossible not to succumb to this game’s many charms. It’s a wonderful interpretation of ancient mythology, and a colorful vision of the afterlife. Once Hades clicks, it’s just so satisfying. You might get sick of those early bosses, but you won’t tire of feeling godlike after pulling off a skillful finishing move.If you missed Hades last year, don’t make the same mistake, especially now that it’s also available on Xbox and PlayStation systems.5 Windows 11 tips I wish I knew when I first startedPuffy Hybrid Lux mattress review 20237 best shows like Ginny and Georgia on NetflixBy Mike ProsperoApril 10, 2023By Michelle Rae UyApril 09, 2023By Tony PolancoApril 07, 2023By Matthew MurrayApril 07, 2023By Brian NadelApril 05, 2023By Peter WolinskiApril 05, 2023By Jackie DoveApril 05, 2023By Kelly WooApril 05, 2023By Dan CavallariApril 04, 2023By Andrew HaywardApril 04, 2023By Tony PolancoApril 04, 2023Tom's Guide is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Hades,Jay Castello,"Rock, Paper, Shotgun",https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/09/17/hades-review/,"Attack and dethrone godHot god encyclopaedia by way of hack ‘n’ slash roguelike Hades was basically already game of the year when it released into early access in 2018. Its core components were all in place. You fight through a constantly randomised hell filled with monsters and bosses as Zagreus, sarcastic and perpetually titty-out son of Hades. Along the way, you can pick up abilities bestowed by gods from across the Greek pantheon. And it’s all set to an obviously perfect Darren Korb soundtrack.Since then, an absolute laundry list of new stuff has been added, but the core has remained the same. Zagreus tears through several layers of his father’s kingdom, wielding one of several weapons (in one of several ‘forms’) that invite distinct approaches to wreaking havoc. Personally, I like to switch my brain off and whale on enemies with the sword or the fists, but I hear there are more subtle approaches that make better use of Zag’s full suite of abilities, dashing and casting and special attacking just so, like someone sophisticated. Whatever floats your boat.Regardless, Zagreus will always meet his grizzly end in one way or another and be escorted back home by the Styx. His pockets will be full of pilfered goods, though, and he can purchase upgrades for his skills and weapons that will come in handy next time, alongside the run-specific upgrades received from Zeus and pals. Also, he can redecorate the house, and let me tell you, my room looks fabulous now.




Watch on YouTube    
With so many upgrade options, any approach is viable. You might spend one run absolutely maxing out the bow’s damage per shot thanks to Artemis’s crit-boosting boons. After that you might focus on crowd control, pushing and pulling hell’s citizens exactly where you want them with the help of Poseidon’s tides. The next you might build a massively overpowered grenade launcher. Since you can’t control what’s on offer, experimentation is practically mandatory and will lead to many weird and wonderful combinations.To shake things up even more, Supergiant’s clever difficulty modifiers are back in the form of the Pact of Punishment, a whole host of options like more enemies and alternate boss forms that Zagreus can choose to toggle up for greater rewards. Conversely, a more forgiving mode will boost your damage resistance on every consecutive failed run until it hits just the right spot.All of this is super, and the game certainly wouldn’t work if each run wasn’t so varied and yet consistently great. But where it excels is the bits in between, after Zag’s taken a nasty tumble and before he leaps out of the window for another go. Each cycle, there’s a chance to get to know some of the pantheon a bit better. The Olympian gods themselves are mostly out of reach, appearing only to give themed blessings that affect a single run, so you can’t do much more with Zeus than accept the ability to call down lightning for a while. But the House of Hades is full of other characters that – ironically – bring the whole place to life. 
 
There are dozens of substories for the residents of the palace, each fantastically written and voice acted. And whether its flirting with the god of death or helping to reunite lost lovers, there’s always something to progress, even if you’re not getting any closer to escaping. And that does more than just encourage another run. It makes the game about fighting pessimism, expanding it beyond just Zagreus’s tenacity in his doomed escape plan to encompass all his friends' woes, too. Supergiant takes all the tragedies of its source material and introduces a forgotten character who just might be able to help set them right again.That’s what drove me to put a hundred hours into Hades before its latest and final update. But, true to form, the 1.0 release comes with a boatload of new things. As well as yet more music (still just so good) and new ways to fight, I had to play another medium-sized game’s worth to progress the main story to credits. And then there’s more!Hades’ structure has lent itself brilliantly to accepting all this new material with every update, whether it be new characters or weapons or enemies or whatever else. Its randomisation and the care taken to tie everything back to existing content means they always slot in neatly, as if they were there all along. Having said that, I’m curious as to how all this content is going to be paced for the player who has been waiting for Hades to be finished before leaping into hell. It seems to me that the best way to play the game was in early access, coming back with each update so that it could spool out across two years. Though I suppose it’s a little late to say that. 
 
It also lends a twin struggle to the main story’s ending. Two years of personal investment is a heavy weight for a game to carry as it emerges out of early access. At times, the final chapters of Zagreus’s tale felt almost self-conscious of that, as if it was aware it had limited time left.Despite that, it easily carried itself on the strength of its emotional impact. Which is great, for me. But I’m curious as to whether newer players will have the time to build up the investment necessary for it to lean on that before they’re thrown into the end game. It seems difficult to pace a story that will unfold radically differently for so many. Not only are players jumping in now getting a very different approach to Hades’ plot, so too does it depend on how good players are and therefore how quickly they progress through the various layers of hell.I can’t answer these questions. Even if I began a new save file, I wouldn’t be able to erase my previous experiences. And for me, Hades been a constant companion for almost two years. I’ve gone back to it any time there’s been an update or I’ve just gotten bored with what else is on offer. It’s been a game I’ve loved writing about dozens of times and one I’ve talked drunk about in bars. I have friends who can be reliably expected to send me fanart when it crosses their attention, and I do the same in return. I hope Hades will land on its feet for new players, and I mostly think it will. But it’s already been special.You're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!

Hades,Abdul Saad,GamingTrend,https://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/the-son-of-the-underworld-returns-hades-ps4-review/,"I’ve loved Greek mythology ever since I was a child. The adventures of Perseus, the story of Sisyphus, the labors of Hercules, and the tale of the Argonauts. These stories have both inspired and entertained me in many ways growing up, so it’s a shame that I’m just now experiencing the story of Zagreus, the son of Hades, and his seemingly never-ending quest to leave the underworld. Now that Hades is officially available on all consoles and I’ve finally had the chance to play it, I now understand why the game is so revered.The first thing I noticed about Hades is the amount of effort and love put into crafting and designing the game’s world. The colorful and detailed environments astonished me and are surprisingly accurate to what you’d expect ancient Greek architecture and interior decor to look like. Even the characters are accurately designed to fit the mythology, especially the gods and demigods who are adorned in brightly colored clothes and accessories. The environments are particularly impressive, as each level is impeccably designed, from the tombs of Tartarus to the fields of Elysium. The visuals are crisp, highly detailed, and attractive, especially on a PS4 Pro, which allows the game to run at a solid 60fps. Though I did notice the frame rate drop when there’s a lot of enemies on screen.   I also appreciate how the game tries to be as engaging as possible by throwing in different events between your failures or successes in climbing up from the underworld, such as meeting characters in dungeons, encountering a rare upgrade, or going back home and having scenes play out between characters. These parts of the game make it a lot more engaging as opposed to other rogue-likes that make gameplay an unforgiving slog.Another captivating part of the game is its incredible voice acting. The cast did a spectacular job at instilling life in the characters, and all surprisingly match their roles quite well. The charismatic son of Hades has a sultry voice to match his demeanor, whereas older, greater gods like Hades, Poseidon, and Nyx have voices befitting their caliber. What’s more, I always found talking to the game’s well-written characters a delight. Watching Zagreus banter with characters like Skelly, Megaera, and oddly enough, Charon the boatman was always fun and spending time with them while learning things like how Sisyphus is a total bro despite his unfortunate circumstance was my favorite part of my playthrough. Now for the meat and potatoes of the game: the gameplay in Hades is just as good, if not better, than the rest of its elements. Gameplay in Hades is a mesh of isometric and rogue-like action. Players leave the house of Hades and fight through multiple randomized chambers through the underworld filled with various enemies and bosses, each of which provide a different sort of challenge.Almost everything about the game is randomized, such as the items being sold between fights, boons granted to Zagreus by the Olympians, keys to unlock more weapons and skills, and more. Eventually, players will be defeated in battle and will have to do it all over again while losing all their upgrades and money. However, no matter how many times you die, there’ll always be a sense of progression as items like darkness and keys are used to attain more skills and weapons that will always be retained upon death to make the next attempt a little bit easier.Though this isn’t to make light of the game’s difficulty, as Hades can be a rather challenging game at times. I found myself always scrambling for health in my first few encounters, as each chamber gets progressively more difficult with armored mobs, explosive enemies, traps, tough bosses, and more. While you can upgrade the amount of health you receive with each chamber and occasionally refill health from fountains, I found that it was usually never enough to get through every fight comfortably- primarily because of my aggressive play style. This perhaps is why Supergiant Games allows players to pick and choose which upgrade or item they’ll be rewarded with upon clearing a chamber. This style of gratification makes a lot of sense as players will be able to choose what reward they want depending on their circumstances. However, Hades’ engaging elements can also at times be its downfall. As a result of the game’s randomized mechanics, it’s not unusual to get incredibly unlucky RNG with boons, health, or items, especially with a specific playthrough in mind. While not often, players can encounter sessions with poor choices for boons, terrible choices of health regen, and more due to poor luck alone.Regardless, Hades is a fantastic game and is really worth all the acclaim and praise it’s received thus far. The game is objectively developer Supergiant Games’ most well-crafted experience. Not only does it offer players a challenge that leaves them with a sense of accomplishment, but it also succeeds in engaging them with lovable characters and an impactful plot.

Hades,David Flynn,GamingTrend,https://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/one-does-not-simply-walk-out-of-hades-hades-review/,"Many have tried to leave the underworld, all have failed. As Prince Zagreus, son of Hades, you’ll get out and die trying, over and over and over. Each attempt will grant you knowledge and strength, but what awaits you on the outside?Hades is the latest game from Supergiant Games, the folks behind amazing titles like Bastion, Transistor, and Pyre. After the fantasy sports experience that was Pyre, they’ve returned to the isometric action style, with a rogue-like twist. Attempting to leave the underworld will see you climb its ever changing depths, riddled with a myriad of foes and a boss waiting at the end of each section. Starting in Tartarus, you proceed to the fields of Asphodel, now a scorching inferno, then to Elysium and beyond. Then when you die you’re sent back to the House of Hades and do it all over again. While you do lose things like money, boons from Olympians, and progress upon death, you keep everything else to make the next escape attempt easier. Darkness can be consumed at Zag’s mirror to power him up. Gemstones can be spent to make the House just a bit nicer or purchase renovations to help you along your journey. You can give Nectar to the gods or other characters in exchange for special Keepsakes (or just to be nice) – almost everything you collect serves a purpose and facilitates future runs.Once you’re prepared and have chosen a weapon, such as a recalling spear or giant fists, you’ll enter the labyrinth that is Tartarus and gain a boon from one of the Olympians. These grant special effects, like having your attack also cause lightning to bounce between enemies or your dash knocking away enemies. Speaking of, Zagreus has a variety of moves at his disposal, depending on what weapon he’s equipped with. Each weapon comes with at least two abilities: a standard attack with Y and a special with X. Outside of weapons, he can also perform a quick dash with the B button and cast a spell with A. While using weapons mostly stays the same, though they can be changed or upgraded using Titans Blood and the Daedalus Hammer, your cast is largely affected by boons. It starts off as a projectile that can be lodged in an enemy for extra damage, but with some help from Aphrodite it can become a short range blast that makes enemies weaker. There are a metric ton of factors that allow you to customize exactly how you want to play, but also makes each run unique as the layout of rooms is randomized in addition to the rewards you get after clearing an encounter.While there is a ton of stuff to see and do in the underworld, most of your time will be spent in combat. While I felt that Bastion was a bit clunky and Transistor was more of a turn based affair, Hades goes for an entirely action oriented approach and it feels fantastic. Enemy attacks are well telegraphed, with the occasional exception of smaller foes, and the prince can zip around the battlefield, dodging attacks and getting the drop on Shades. Each weapon is fun to use once you figure out their playstyle -I’m not too keen on the Aegis shield and the Adamant Rail – but after a few boons I started to warm up to them.Supergiant are most well known for their emotional stories and those expecting that may be a little disappointed in Hades. You’re essentially doing a Sisyphus in attempting escape over and over, but it makes up for this in character. Zagreus himself is, thankfully, a highlight. He’s got a ton of quips and spouts them off frequently as you play. Speaking to characters like Achilies and Nyx is always a highlight each time I return to the House of Hades, and as you progress they’ll comment on how you’re doing and how far you’ve made it. This can get a bit weird if you make a bunch of progression in one go. For example I made it to the final boss on my 7th run, after previously only reaching the second area, and hours later Zeus was surprised that I had made it to Elysium. I feel like they should have a queue of some sort as accomplishments relate to dialogue. The sound design in conversations can be odd as well. The game seems to use a system that lowers the volume of other noise like music and sound effects while someone is talking, but it can come back at full volume even when someone shortly pauses in a sentence. It’s a very nice touch in gameplay, but when speaking to someone I think it would be more beneficial if other sounds were lowered for the duration of the dialogue as it can be a bit distracting.Hades has been in early access on PC for a while now and with its full 1.0 release it also comes to Switch. Rogue-likes are a perfect fit for Switch and Hades is no different. Each run only takes about 40 minutes which makes it great to pick up and play. Performance makes no compromises either. In docked mode it runs in 1080p and mostly stays around 60 fps, only dropping frames when there are a ridiculous number of enemies on screen. I can only assume in portable mode it runs in 720p due to the screen’s resolution, but it’s likewise remarkably stable. The game will also support cross saves at some point, so if you’re already playing on PC it may be worth double dipping for the portability. The only problem I have with this version is that the font is far too small in some places. It doesn’t reach Xenoblade X levels of unreadability, but it is difficult to read no matter what mode you’re playing in.Supergiant has made another modern classic. Hades offers some of the best rogue-like gameplay out there and delivers a satisfying experience in all aspects. From the wonderfully voiced characters to the fluidity of combat, there’s a lot to love here as you die over and over again.—David FlynnSee below for our list of partners and affiliates:One of the longest running independent gaming news, reviews and culture sites on the web.The thing that is magical about the Wizarding World isn’t the magic – it’s...by Ron BurkeThe world is going to end.

Hades,Cale Hunt,Windows Central,https://www.windowscentral.com/hades-pc-game-should-playing,"No offers foundWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.Indie developer Supergiant Games has made a name for itself over the last decade with beloved games like Bastion, Transistor, and Pyre. While the three games are still played to this day by many people, it seems like Supergiant's latest effort is a culmination of all it learned over the years. Hades, which got its 1.0 release September 17, had a strong Early Access period that consistently saw new content and mechanics added.I played a significant amount of Hades while it was still a work in progress, taking a break right around the time Supergiant was gearing up for the official release. Chances are if you're a PC gamer you've already heard of Hades; it has an Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam with more than 100,000 player reviews and generally has more than 20,000 concurrent players according to Steam Charts. It's also one of our picks for best indie game.So why is everyone flocking to Hades? Let's take a look at where it excels and why you should give it a shot if you haven't already been enjoying this hellish roguelike.Bottom line: An epic soundtrack, top-tier voice acting, gorgeous artwork and locales, frenetic but balanced action, and an addictive roguelike progression system and surprisingly deep build system come together to make Hades the indie game you should be playing if you have a PC.I'm a sucker for roguelike games no matter the platform, spending a significant amount of time with titles like Enter the Gungeon, Dead Cells, Binding of Isaac, and Slay the Spire. What exactly is a roguelike game? It's one that's designed to have you die over and over, restarting at the very beginning each time until you finally defeat the final boss. A great roguelike will allow you to get just a bit further each playthrough, usually due to skill improvement and permanent unlocks through some form of in-game currency.Most roguelikes have procedural level generation, most have a deep unlock system that remains even after death, and most have deeply varied gameplay (with pickups, equipment, and skills) that will make every run different from the last. Some also offer a storyline that's compelling enough to string you along through hundreds of restarts, but it's usually the raw gameplay that keeps players coming back.I've also dedicated a good portion of the last 20 years of my life to playing Diablo II, one of the best aRPG dungeon-crawlers ever made. Hades feels a bit like an aRPG with its frantic isometric action, at least enough to keep me satisfied while we await Diablo IV's dungeon-crawling goodness. But where an aRPG goes incredibly deep with loot and crafting, Hades fills the hole with roguelike aspects.Hades takes parts from a bunch of different genres and forges them into something special.There are multiple weapons to unlock — you select one before attempting a run — including a bow and arrow, shield, spear, fists, and railgun. Keepsakes are unlocked by presenting gifts to the deities and character you meet during your travels. These keepsakes will either give you an immediate boost to some aspect of your character, or they will ensure you see a specific boon to start off your run. This makes it much easier to get a solid start to a specific build during a run. Yes, it is possible to design your character each time you run through, though of course the roguelike nature means there is some chance to what you'll get.Your Special, Cast, and Call abilities can all be overhauled with certain boons as well, which means one run you can be a Hangover-inducing party animal and the next you can be a Lightning-wielding Zeus fanatic. Plenty of times I've accidentally discovered a potent combination of boons, turning a throwaway run into a veritable push to leave the Underworld. It's a system that's much deeper than what's evident at first glance, and it makes players go for just one more run.Some of my favorite roguelike games don't have much of a storyline to follow and lean heavily on addicting gameplay. Dead Cells, for example, has you play as a headless prisoner who must kill the High King. There are hints of story throughout, but that's about as far as it goes. Hades, on the other hand, has an actual storyline that is uncovered as you play the game.You're Zagreus, son of Hades, and you're attempting to escape the Underworld with the help of some relatives. Why? Your dad is an ass and you're sick of missing out on all the fun your cousins, aunts, and uncles are having on Mount Olympus. Oh, you're also trying to figure out where you came from. That's just scraping the surface; the more runs you attempt, the more story you'll dig up. Perhaps most compelling is the endgame storyline, which continues branching out even after you've reached the ""end."" For a roguelike, that's a big deal.Characters in the game remember you as you make your way to the surface over and over, commenting on your abilities and exploits. Your immortal state is no big deal to them, thanks to the magic of Greek mythology. The more you play, the more you begin to understand what's going on. Voice acting is superb here, as is the artwork. Each character has a definite personality, which really puts some icing on the cake.Keeping a roguelike game feeling fresh isn't necessarily easy. You are, after all, playing the same levels over and over again. But Hades employs some roguelike staples to keep things looking (mostly) new when you make another run. First and foremost, levels are procedurally generated. Each section has a theme and there are certainly blocks you'll begin to expect, but you're not going to be running through the exact same levels each time. With the contractor back at the house of Hades, you can add new areas to these sections as well.Once an encounter (basically one room or level in Hades speak) is complete, you will have one or two paths to choose from based on reward and difficulty. You might also experience a Trove trial that has you kill enemies as fast as possible for a reward. Chaos gates also mix things up with timed debuffs that eventually wear off and give you a big bonus. All this, combined with the different enemies, skills, and weapons means you're going to have a different experience each time.Hades looks beautiful, and it handles just as well. I was a bit overwhelmed when I first saw gameplay, but you need not really worry about the insane pace of action. I don't know how Supergiant did it, but it's actually relatively easy to follow the action despite its frenetic pace. There are almost always a ton of effects going off on the screen, but you can still quickly get into a rhythm of dashing and attacking. And when you do hit that rhythm, you become a machine of death that is extremely satisfying.Hades is easy to pick up for a quick game, but you'll soon find an hour has gone by.I spent the first 15 runs or so madly mashing the dash button and spamming attack, but I've since slowed things down to great effect. Sure, you can have a lot of fun mashing every button, but if you really want to succeed you're going to need to practice timing. You're also going to need to experiment with different boons and skills to see what works well together and what suits your playstyle.Hades is easy to pick up and start feeling right away like you're making a difference, and it's not going to grow stale after a few hours. And even if you aren't particularly skilled at the game (looking at myself), the myriad character upgrades available will eventually make you far more resilient and powerful, allowing you to go just a bit further each time.Hades is the best PC game I've played this year, and it's also available on Nintendo Switch. Considering it's priced at $25, this should be a staple of just about any gamer's library. It's just a shame it's not available on Xbox or PlayStation.I know Cyberpunk 2077 is just around the corner, but Hades will remain near the top of my recently played list for the foreseeable future. If you're a fan of roguelikes, action combat games, Greek mythology, or Supergiant's flair for game design, you need to give this a try.Dying To Visit The UnderworldAn epic soundtrack, top-tier voice acting, gorgeous artwork and locales, frenetic but balanced action, and an addictive roguelike progression system and surprisingly deep build system come together to make Hades the indie game you should be playing if you have a PC.Cale Hunt is formerly a Senior Editor at Windows Central.

Hades,Keza MacDonald,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/oct/01/hades-review-a-sexy-scintillating-sojourn-in-the-greek-underworld,"PC, Mac, Nintendo Switch; Supergiant GamesThis gripping action game set in a hellish realm filled with gorgeous gods and monsters is well worth the years it took to makePowered by chugging guitars, frenetic fighting and luscious, flamboyant depictions of figures from Greek mythology, this excellent action game from the arthouse studio Supergiant has been many years in the making. We play as Zagreus, wayward son of the underworld, trying to escape his father’s gloomy domain and see the world above. As an immortal, he cannot die – but each time he is defeated by the denizens of the underworld, whether by the fallen warriors of Elysium or the flaming skulls and witches in Tartarus, he is returned to his bedroom like a shamed teenager, ready to start again.In most games of this nature, where each attempt strips you of progress and hard-won powers, being sent back to the start makes me want to quit. But when Zagreus re-emerges into the chambers of Hades, there are gossiping shades and surly servants; the lord of the underworld grumbles over stacks of paperwork, barely glancing upwards to reprimand his son for his latest escape attempt. I am quickly distracted from my failure by some words of sympathy from Nyx, or Megaera mooching in the corner. And before long I am back at it, trying to escape from fiery Asphodel, running into a zombie Charon mumbling over some treasures for sale or descending into a pit to meet Chaos.This is the kind of video game fighting that puts your heart in your mouth, an exhilarating whirl of slashes and strikes and dodges. Each jewel in Zagreus’ armoury – brass-knuckles, greatshield and sword, railgun, spear – has its own rhythm: some favour quick flurries at close range, others charge up to unleash hell on rooms full of gorgons and cursed chariots. Conquered chambers sometimes bring a new blessing from one of Zagreus’ relatives up on Mount Olympus, boons that add a watery damage-dealing flourish to your dash or imbue your weapon with lightning, calls that summon gods to unleash magical arrows or make you invincible.These abilities arrive in endless new combinations, starting fresh each time you set foot into Tartarus. It makes each run at the underworld exciting and different, even with the same few weapons; each time you think, yes, this is the build that’s going to get me past the hydra or the minotaur.Claiming these blessings also offers up opportunities to have conversations with the gods, which is just as interesting. The bickering, shifting alliances and long, long histories of affairs and grievances between the Greek deities and their entourage shines through in Hades’ writing. Zagreus says “mate” far too often for any wayward immortal – indeed, he says it about as often as a London market trader – but the relationships and characters here are nonetheless believable and intriguing.Every time you succumb to the legions of Hell, the disappointment is tempered by the prospect of returning to Hades’ chambers again for a chat with Achilles and to give Cerberus a snuggle. This game has found the secret to (almost) eternal storytelling: a play loop that repeats itself, but dialogue that doesn’t. Interesting things happen all the time, in conversations and chance encounters as well as in battles, and no matter how long I spend with Hades I feel like I am only just getting acquainted with it.Quite apart from its fine qualities as a hellish hack-and-slasher, Hades has what Twitter would describe as strong bisexual energy. Perhaps this is just everyone’s lockdown libido desperately searching for an outlet, but in the past couple of weeks social media has gone mad for art director Jen Zee’s wonderfully drawn gods and monsters, with their elegant musculature, casually revealing outfits and appropriately godlike profiles. I get it. This game worships the beautiful lines of the human body almost as much as the classical sculptors who hewed the Elgin marbles. Even the Minotaur is kind of hot.I make it to Elysium every time, now, usually with my bow or broadsword. I have met and vanquished all the Furies, several times over. I know I won’t stop returning to the underworld until Zagreus sees the surface. Just as each run holds the promise of that perfect boon, that lucky run of enemies perfectly suited to the weapon I’ve chosen, something can always happen to screw things up. But that’s Greek mythology for you: fate can be cruel, and the gods don’t really care what happens as long as they are entertained.Hades is available now, £19.99"
Hades,Dan Silver,Telegraph,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/features/hades-review-devilishly-good-time/,"
			Supergiant's crisp, colourful and chaotic journey through the underworld is a superior roguelike and a tremendous game in its own right
		Einstein famously defined insanity as doing the same thing again and again but expecting a different result each time. Quite would he made of ‘roguelikes', then, is anybody’s guess. The increasingly popular - and prevalent - game design trope tasks players with repeating procedurally-generated ‘runs’ ad infinitum, usually with character progress or resources carried over to increase incrementally the chance of success on each subsequent attempt.Hades applies the formula expertly to an equally polished isometric action RPG brawler, creating sadistic assault courses from strings of standalone rooms populated by an amusing menagerie of netherworldly creations, dastardly traps and melodramatic deities drawn from Greek mythology. Combat is crisp, chaotic and perfectly pitched on just the right side of frustrating. West Coast developers Supergiant Games - creators of quirky but celebrated indie hits Bastion, Transistor, and Pyre - conjure a surprising amount of tactical depth from half a dozen weapon types and a deceptively simple moveset comprising standard, heavy and ranged attacks; a rechargeable super; and a dash. The magic is provided by boons - quite literally gifts from the gods your character Prince Zagreus randomly encounters on each run and which completely transform his attempt to ascend from Hades to Mount Olympus . Zeus imbues your attacks with lighting damage which can jump from foe to foe; Dionysus add a hangover effect which damages enemies over time; and Aphrodite allows you to charm enemies, who then fight by your side. Hades was in ‘early access’ (ie released and then iterated upon on the fly) on PC for almost two years and the sheer volume of variables in this ‘finished’, fully-featured 1.0 release (also available on Nintendo Switch) is mind-boggling - and initially a little confusing. There’s around eight different forms of in-game currency alone, and enough upgrades and modifiers to give even Euclid a headache trying to track all the variables. However once you fall under Hades’ spell after a couple of runs the near limitless combinations of character builds becomes bewitching. That rich seam of conglomerated content also extends to the game’s surprisingly engaging over-arching narrative. Each run starts in the House of Hades, a gloriously gauche mansion populated by the big and the bad of the Underworld, and who carry on like the cast of a reality show. I'm a Demigod, Get Me out of Here, perhaps.Unusually for the sub genre there’s plot and dialogue to spare, the large cast of classical characters delivering chunks of mythologically accurate exposition between (and often during) runs via an astonishing amount of nearly always entertaining dialogue. It’s a welcome amuse bouche before the main courses of mayhem to come, and helps establish Hades not just as a superior roguelike, but also a superb game in its own right.If anything, Hades might actually be too engaging. Once under its thrall it boasts as much of that ‘one more go...’ factor as any game released this generation, and the chances of a quick end of evening session stretching into the early hours of the following morning are ruinously high. There’s every chance Hades might will end up driving you insane, then - but at least you’ll have a devilishly good time along the way.  "
Hades,Rob Larkin,Gaming Nexus,https://www.gamingnexus.com/Article/7394/Hades/,"So a funny thing happened on my way to playing Hades. Ignorant of Hades' very existence (despite it already being well-established as a PC game), I had Curse of the Dead Gods land on my review plate, and loved it. But after submitting my review, my score of 9 landed it a step above the MetaCritic average of 78. Digging into why, one refrain kept popping up: ""It wasn't as good as Hades.""Desperate to experience this allegedly superior product for myself, I jumped at the chance to dive in once last year's PC release finally made this present jump to consoles. So what was it about this action roguelike that made it so much better? What lightning did it catch in a bottle to garner so many game of the year awards? Apparently, that lightning was a gift from Zeus himself—because damn, this game is so, so good.  Let's start with the comparison, if only briefly. Each is an action roguelike. Each has the typical gameplay loop of making runs through gauntlets of randomly generated maps. It rewards your attempts to reach the end boss. And, continuing the run, you slowly gain strength and powers to tackle future challenges. Curse of the Dead Gods is a little deeper with its in-run power-ups (or curses in the case of Dead Gods vs. Hades' boons of gifts from Greek deities). Curse of the Dead Gods has some extremely clever elements, like the use of the torch and balancing light and dark. It's significantly more challenging in its combat, both with the seemingly greater arsenal of weapons at your disposal to master. And the straight-up harder minions on the way to the end bosses.Most Hades runs end at a boss level, while most Dead Gods runs end, well, anywhere that your life meter eventually whittles down. On the other side, Hades is better at...literally everything else. And not just better than Dead Gods. When it comes to world building, storytelling, humor, presentation, polish, and full-on gameplay addiction, it's better than most every other game in your library. Hades is masterfully crafted and an incredible overall experience.  Because you see, even those points I would want to give Dead Gods for depth and challenge, I'm not even sure Hades is worse off without them. Hades does such a good job of not only weaving the endless retry mechanic into the very lore of the story itself, but also rewards you for each failure by eking out that much more of the story—told primarily in the lens of managing your relationships with the many mythical NPCs that grace the underworld.It slowly reveals more and more of the interpersonal dynamics amongst gods and their children. Fail a run, get some more enjoyable dialogue and a chance to spend some currency earned in your last one on some new starting powers before your next attempt. It's a fabulous cycle, and the end result is pure pleasure. I'm not bogged down on any given run by steep difficulty curves, and not annoyed when one ends. I'm eager to jump into the next after fishing out another reward moving the narrative forward that little bit more.  And the presentation of it all is spot on. Some of the non-gameplay trailers and animations just don't do the gameplay justice. This world of Hades is what would happen if Studio Ghibli started making games and transported them from Japan to the Greek underworld. The voice acting is on point, following well-written scripts, and embedded with humor and style. The storytelling as a whole somehow manages to pull off a wonderful little chronicle with just a dialogue snippet at a time in a genre where narrative is almost always overlooked, if not entirely absent. Even if the combat isn't the most artful to master, the storytelling more than makes up for that by shifting much of that weight onto the shoulders of the way the epic is measured out an interaction at a time, as if unfolded by a raconteur. Even if the bosses represent a difficulty spike the minions never match on the way to their lair, the mechanics to best both remain consistent and fair. It shifts the focus squarely onto that path of loot and building your character for this run to overcome that fearsome obstacle that you know is looming.There is no overarching map of the total path to the end like most games of this ilk employ, instead just giving you a choice of doors upon completing each room. Again, this seeming lack of detail that seems to becoming the norm of other games and their presentation, in the hands of Hades is less a detriment and more just another proof point to pin the game loop away from the grand strategy and into the here and now of following the flow of the run.Embrace the carefree nonchalance of your hero, Zagreus, and just enjoy the ride. And if Megaera happen to slay you and cut short your progress again, embrace Zagreus' very words, ""Damn you, Meg,"" and step out together with your hero to try anew. The game excels at the rare feat of turning its own weakness into strength. And there is depth there, don't get me wrong. Hades might not be as deep in one area or another as some others in the field, but it's no slouch. There are a handful of currencies to collect to build out your starting upgrades, a pantheon of Gods to offer more in each run, a host of NPCs to interact with and be entertained by, scores of enemies, and a half dozen primary weapons that are each so unique in their primary and special attacks that they represent six distinct play styles, not just six shades of a singular combat mechanic.  It's a beautiful game. And although I played primarily on PS5 I did open up my PS4 for a singular run and couldn't say the experience was any bit inferior, even if it wasn't in 4K at 60 FPS like on the next-gen system. It's a game for any system: PC, Switch, Xboxes, or PlayStations. It's deep enough to give you so many ways to rerun the randomly generated maps of rooms, easy enough to pick up and enjoy straightaway, and so well-crafted as to entice you to keep aspiring run after run despite your failures. I stand by my review of Curse of the Dead Gods. It's an excellent game well deserving of a 9. But if that's true, then yeah, Hades is even that little bit better. Even my one criticism, that Hades maybe isn't quite as deep in combat, I can't be sure if changing that would actually improve the overall experience. When the playing experience is such a joy, when the storytelling grabs center stage, who's to even say that more depth or more difficulty would actually enhance that? Hades is a game that will deservingly be listed in every ""best of"" list for the action roguelike genre. It's a seminal entry into the field. It's a 10. Action roguelikes is a genre seeing a bit of a surge of new entires lately, and Hades is as good or better as anything you will find in that field. It offers an overall experience in storytelling and gameplay that is top-notch regardless of genre. It's this incredibly unique type of game and play loop that turns your every failure and death into a reward of unlocking more story, injecting more humor, and inviting you to take a stab at one more run. It's won numerous game of the year awards on PC, and there is no reason for those accolades to stop with the port to consoles. Just don't forget to give Cerebus a pet on your way to the next run.* The product in this article was sent to us by the developer/company. First picked up a game controller when my mother bought an Atari 2600 for my brother and I one fateful Christmas.   Now I'm a Software Developer in my day job who is happy to be a part of the Gaming Nexus team so I can have at least a flimsy excuse for my wife as to why I need to get those 15 more minutes of game time in...

The game's been available on other platforms since September of last year, and has garnered heaps of praise and awards in the months it's taken to appear on Sony's systems. You probably already know what we're going to say about Supergiant's rogue-lite action game, because we've had a year of people falling in love with the darn thing. Still, it's always nice to try something first hand, and we'd be remiss to skip over this celebrated indie title. We've been making our attempts to escape Hell on PlayStation 5, and you know what? The game's really bloody good.Let's wind it all back and start at the start. You play as Zagreus, son of Hades, and he's sick of his stuffy life in the Underworld. Shunning his princely duties and with contempt for his uncaring father, he decides to leave home and escape to the surface — but to do that, he'll first have to make it through the four treacherous regions between him and the fresh air above. Of course, his journey will be a tough one, and will involve numerous deaths as he tries again and again to make it that little bit further. Fortunately, being a god of the Underworld, repeatedly dying and returning to his own home isn't exactly a problem.The main thrust of gameplay is with these escape attempts, and it all plays out like an isometric dungeon crawler. You'll hack and slash your way through hundreds of enemies in hand-crafted rooms that are randomly arranged. The action is generally very fast and, for the most part, taking damage feels dangerous; you'll be making liberal use of the dodge in order to preserve what little HP you have.After defeating a handful of baddies, you'll move into the next area. You might have multiple doorways to choose from, and your only decision will come from what reward you want after the impending fight. Boons are buffs handed down to you by the gods of Olympus, and these can imbue Zagreus with all kinds of stat boosts, elemental effects, and more. They're your bread and butter for getting stronger throughout a run, and each god's unique set of Boons will stack with the others, resulting in some seriously potent effects.In addition to these, you might also pick up Darkness crystals, Gemstones, Keys, or gold for the shops that could appear ahead. The thing is, every room reward is valuable to you in some way, so it can be a tough call between building your strength or acquiring something that'll come in handy down the line. The balance feels pretty spot on; you're never left with bad options.Starting off with a simple sword, the combat can initially feel limited, but the small selection of attacks all feel great to pull off. Each of the six weapons has a basic attack and a special move, and then you have your cast, which is a projectile. It's not much, but when you factor in how differently all the weapons play and how the Boons and other modifications can alter your moveset, the developer has squeezed surprising mileage out of a concise combat system. Depending on which Boons you have, how they play off each other, and how you build out Zagreus, each run can feel very different from the last. It's wonderfully done, even if some of the encounters can get a little too chaotic.But what's perhaps most remarkable about Hades is what it does outside of the escape attempts. Every time you die, you return to the hub area. Here, you can not only invest persistent currencies in things like new weapons and making Zagreus stronger, you can hang out and talk to numerous characters, which progresses the story in some way. You can speak with Hades himself, but others like Nyx, Achilles, Dusa, Megaera, and many more will be up for a chat sooner or later. Everyone in the game is fun to talk to, and you'll find that death isn't really a pain — you may even look forward to returning to the House of Hades so you can see what everyone has to say next.The sheer amount of dialogue is pretty staggering — we've very rarely seen the same thing twice, and even better, the game has context sensitive answers for basically everything you do. The characters really feel as though they're responding to you and your actions, rather than simply reading the next line on the page. Even the Olympian gods will pass comment on your exploits when you encounter one of their Boons during a run. It's fantastic, and gives every character presence in Zagreus' journey. Occasionally the voice acting misses the mark, but the majority is well done, and everyone you meet has a distinct personality.The loop of going out on a run, dying, and doing the rounds in the hub becomes super fun and addictive, because everything feeds into everything else. Making steady progress out in the Underworld, trying out new weapons and Boon combinations, is seriously moreish, and only gets better the more time you put in. Then, talking with residents of the House of Hades, deepening your relationships and slowly unraveling the story, is compelling too, especially the way it all reacts to what and how you've been playing. It's all so cohesive, it's a wonder that rogue-lite titles ever struggled to tell stories in the past.After finally escaping for the first time, the game's momentum does slow down somewhat. The endgame Pact of Punishment, which introduces Heat levels to up the challenge for experienced players, is a brilliant and fleshed out addition, but it all gets a bit grindy. You might need some rare resources for certain upgrades, and getting them can be a proper burn. Fortunately, the game is such that you can play it for just minutes or several hours and have fun, but it can sometimes feel like an uphill battle to get what you need. Still, this is a small nitpick in the grand scheme of things. The overwhelming amount of things the game does well is remarkable — and we've yet to mention the superb music and artwork, which is the cherry atop a delicious cake.Hades has been a long time coming for PlayStation players, but the wait was certainly worth it. Supergiant's rogue-lite action title is every bit as good as you've heard, with its fast-paced combat, wonderful Boon system, and amazing story that's interlaced with the gameplay. It's a complex game, but not a complicated one; it's a brilliantly constructed thing that delivers in practically every department. Easily one of the best rogue-lite titles available, Hades lives up to the legend.Excellent 9/10Scoring PolicyReview copy provided by Supergiant GamesPlease note that some external links on this page are affiliate links, which means if you click them and make a purchase we may receive a small percentage of the sale.

Does this version have hdr support?@Quintumply Thanks for the review. I made a good choice to pre-order this by the sound if it .As I'm not a fan of rogue-like games, will this one change my mind?So Hades's about a prince who skips his duties to go independent from his dysfunctional family? So it's a Prince Harry simulator.Have it on Switch and its amazing and easily one of the best games out there, i disagree on voice acting as i think its all fantastic and voiced to perfection. One of the few games i have zero faults with.@R1spam No HDR support, but it looks great regardless.Can.. not.. wait! Pre-ordered the second it was added to the store. Loved all of Supergiants games before this. It's been an agonising wait but it's almost here. Great review btw.Absolutely disagree wholeheartedly with the voice acting comments, it’s got some of the best performances this last generation. It’s one of those games that I have zero faults with. Just imagine the score if it had a Playstation Studios logo at the start.I’m so excited for people who never got play Hades yet! I was only interested from the superlative reviews — I always get burned by Supergiant — but it ended up being one of my favorite games ever and I’m still impressed with how they used the rogue-like/lite genre as a substrate for an amazing narrative experience.@mwatcher Yes. Hades completely subverts the roguelike/roguelite genre. The most punishing aspect of “RLs” is Hades’ most rewarding. At it’s worst, it’s an amazingly clever trick and rock-solid action game that’s worth experiencing, but at it’s best it could easily be among the all-time favorites for many people and a watershed title in game design.@AdamNovice But who is he killing then 🤔Can't wait to try it out.Having played it at my mates, via switch, I can say I'm certainly excited for this- and I find it amusing that Theseus is included as a negative, because fighting him (or otherwise) he's a real *****, hah.@nessisonett Same. I generally hate English VO in games. I rarely can even suffer it, let alone enjoy it, but Hades is exceptionally well done. Zagreus is probably the weakest performance, and it’s still good. The actor who plays Hades brings so much depth to the character, he’s got to be an all-time greatest antagonist in gaming history. I’m particularly fond of the portrayal of Zeus/Poseidon (same actor I think). You don’t have to be familiar with the Greek pantheon to completely understand their personalities and how others relate to them. Also it’s amazing just how much voice work there is! 120 hours and I only heard one line of dialogue twice.Only ever heard amazing things about this and can't wait to try it out should I ever have time.@get2sammyb Make the time! It’s a very special game.Will probably have to go ahead and get this then. Oh well! 😃@mwatcher I'd say so! As a genre, it isn't one of my favourites, but I'd say there's a lot of background rpg elements at work here, and the combat does feel great, so for 20 quid, I'd say it's worth a try!Ridiculous to say voice acting is a negative. I wholeheartedly agree with some of the others on the comments section here and it’s really some of the best you’ll hear in a game. The comment about combat being hard to read is also not true also. You learn your skills snd it’s very clear what works and what doesn’t.In fact to give this game so many negatives is ridiculous and maybe the reviewer should take up a new hobby!As much as I love Hades. I agree.....Theseus deserves a whole point taken off.@Quintumply Knowing how well it plays on Switch, I'd love to know what PS5 brings to the table in regards to load times and adaptive trigger support.@Hurblyburbly Dude, he scored it 9/10! @lolwhatno The press I've had mixed fortunes with SuperGiant Games. Bastion I waited two years to come to Playstation and I ended up finding it a bit disappointing. Transistor I couldn't get on with cos I struggle with real time strategy gameplay but Pyre I really enjoyed. After finishing Returnal, it should stand me in good stead to play a rogue like where it's story is one of the main driving forces.@MFTWrecks The game only has that initial load before the start screen, and it's a couple of seconds long. After that, no loading, but I think that's the same with every version.There's only one use of adaptive triggers as far as I know, and it's when you pet Cerberus. No meaningful use of haptic feedback either, just your basic rumble. Hardly a deal breaker, of course.@get2sammyb Exactly….so many negatives and still gives it a 9/10. Clearly doesn’t add up! Tell him to take to knitting instead!@Hurblyburbly Will do!My gut tells me this is another in a long list of games where people equate difficulty with quality but I'll keep an open mind and give it a try.Day one on Gamepasssorry i'll get my coat@zupertramp It’s not really very hard to be honest. The game gives you enough tools to get past everything except the bosses, which require a bit more thought. Even then, there’s a natural progression due to the upgrades between runs that increase your chances of success until you escape for the first time.@trev666 so renting the game for 10/month is better than owning it at 25?I've heard nothing but fantastic things about this game. Backlog is a bit big right now, so have lots of things to play, so will likely jump in once it's on sale.@zebric21 hardly anyone is paying £10.99 for gamepass. Microsoft give you rewards points I used those and got 3 years gamepass ultimate for £0@zebric21 Well, if you're already subscribed to game pass then yes, it's kinda better.@nessisonett still slightly skeptical but I can't not try it, as much as people talk about it.Is the game running at 60fps? Watching youtube vids on this and it appears quite jerky...30fps?I still can't believe the edge lords gave this GOTY over Tlou2 or GoT! As good of an indie as it is, it doesnt compare to the amount of work that went into the other two games.Ive already seen enough to know it wont compare to Returnal, which is currently my GOTY 21, but at £20 ill give it a crack!@Northern_munkey It runs at 60!@Loftimus I'm also a huge advocate for Returnal, and Hades is right up there as a favourite game of this year for me. While they both have rogue-like elements to them, they're really very different, but both extremely good.Played this on Switch and it has converted me to rougelites however I'm skeptical of double dipping because I've never actually beaten the final boss and there's no cross-save right now...@trev666 Can you play Hades right now on Game Pass? I'm seriously asking, not trolling. I don't really know how Game Pass works. You only get the games for a certain amount of time? If so that kinda sucks. Hades would probably take way longer than a month to get all the Achievements/Trophies. That type of rental system wouldn't really work for me.N.i.c.e thats the score i was expecting.a 9 is amazing.supergiant games makes epic games.word up sonLooking forward to the game! Some brutal comments against the reviewer though, you do all realise a review is opinion based? They are entitled to put what they believe, they could be wrong or right.I wholeheartedly disagree about Theseus being a fault.Creating such a “worst” character is no small feat, and makes annihilating him ever so satisfying.Defo double dipping on this. Can't wait to play it at 60fps and I don't normally care about that sort of thing. The switch version is great but once you've done a good number of runs, loading takes longer and it doe stutter a bit. Oly my second actual PS5 title bought!Also the voice acting is god tier and Thesus is a dick.This is a GREAT game but the framerate on the Switch put me off of it completely. I am hyped to play it now on PS@The_New_Butler I'm going to play it with an open mind, but it will have to be pretty f'ing good to live up to the emotional impact of Tlou2.@Loftimus They're quite different experiences though. Hades is all about the gameplay loop, and while it does have a surprisingly empathetic narrative (though this isn't new for SuperGiant), the focus is on the moment-to-moment combat - as I'm sure you are aware after playing Returnal.If you want to see how much love was poured into this game go check out the NoClip doc on YT about the making of it.@bimboliquido Haha, he's in the Cons as a joke, mostly!**adds to wishlist**@The_New_Butler it wasn't just the emotional impact though. Gameplay, voice acting, animation and atmosphere were top tier on top of the emotional story.Im looking forward to playing this, but no way is an isometric dungeon crawler topping Tlou2 at anything, in my eyes.Horses for courses though isn't it?Would have bought this immediately if it had cross-save, what an utter shame that it's not possible. Without that it just doesn't make sense for me to buy it, I really do not want to start all over with a new save.@The_New_Butler I dont pay for something i don't want to enjoy. I'm just a realist and it is going to have to charm the pants off of me to top my GOTY for last year. We shall see!@Quintumply
Can I ask, roughly, how much of a good run is dependant on luck of the dice, skill, and persistent upgrades? I’m not big on RLs generally, especially if luck of procedural generation in levels or boons plays a large factor.I can’t do “rogue type” games - presuming this means you have play until you die and lose all progress and have to start again each time.It’s too frustrating and just makes me annoyed. But it’s great to see popular indie games from studios like this @thefourfoldroot I mean that's quite a big question really. Success will come down to a combination of those three things. If you get Boons and other upgrades that complement each other well, that's going to be a huge benefit, but ultimately you won't get very far without a bit of skill. The permanent upgrades obviously will help.What I would say to anyone impatient with how rogue-likes work is that this game has God Mode, which boosts your defence by 20%, and that bonus increases a little bit every time you die. So, eventually, you'll have mammoth defence and will be able to breeze through, but you'll still be able to enjoy the story, which is purposely dealt out piece by piece with every death. It might resolve some of your concern Yeah no, the voice acting in this game is superb, reviewer is way off the mark in that regard.Definitely buying Hades again after loving it on Switch.As a side note, all of Supergiant’s previous games are massively discounted in the summer sale - Bastion for £2.99 in particular is unreal value!Loved it on the Switch and I'm double-dipping for the 4K resolution! It was mentioned in the PS4 Underground video.@Jeevz Game Pass works like streaming services work (minus the whole streaming thing unless you use Microsoft's Cloud Service): you can download and play the game for as long as you have an active subscription and the game exists on Game Pass.Games generally are on there for more than a single month - they are usually there for a few months. Plus, there is an 20% discount on games that are currently on Game Pass should you choose to buy a game you like - I know people argue that you are paying for a game twice, but if you pay for Game Pass to play one single game, then that doesn't make as much sense.I really should give this game a whirl on Game Pass, though.@Quintumply Ok, thanks, that’s useful to know! Doesn’t seem like you encountered any poor balancing so that’s good.This was my attempt to get into this style of game but I'm just convinced this isn't my type of game. It just never clicked for me but I can still appreciate for folks that are into this style of game seem to universally love it so kudos to the team.@GamingFan4Lyf oh okay, I still don't really like the idea of games leaving the service whether it's 1 month or 3 months or whatever. Also paying for a game at a discount from a service you already pay for is dastardly. Well done Microsoft. I prefer the simplicity of PS Plus, gimme my games no matter what they are!Say amen, there he goes again. 🤣Rogue like games have been my goto recently having just got the plat for Returnal. I am also currently playing Undermine, Curse of the dead gods and still play Binding of Isaac almost daily (even though i have the platinum). I held off getting this on pc for so long and cannot wait for this!!P.s great review to.Struggled massively with this game on the switch. Not my usual style of game and was actually my first (and only) dip in to the Rogue like genre. Only reason i took the plunge was the absolutely amazing art style, the fact that i like anything greek mythology and the fact i thought it was about time i gave the genre a go. I just died alot and it got very frustrating for me. I ended up thinking ""ive got a bunch of games on the shelf, part way through that i could be making progress with"" its a shame as i really like everything about it apart from the ""die, start again"" bit.@Jeevz You kind of have to look at it from a different lens. People don't subscribe to Game Pass for a single game and then turn around and buy it and cancel the subscription. That's just...well..you're an idiot if you do that. The same could be said for those with PS Now subscriptions. There are no savings there.You have to look at it like you are paying the subscription fee for the almost 200 games that are there (almost 300 if you pay for Ultimate with the included EA Play). It makes each game really look to be pennies per month.Plus, Game Pass Ultimate still get the Games With Gold games every month just like PS+ people get their games with the subscription - best of both worlds on the Microsoft side.Really, all Sony would need to do is combine PS+ and PS Now into a single subscription fee to have something equivalent - minus the whole ""day one"" release of first-party titles.Different strokes for different folks.Granted, it's easy for me to scream the values of Game Pass Ultimate when I don't pay for it (legally) - I make out like a bandit!Regarding Hades, I can just enjoy the game without paying a dime. If it goes away after a couple months, so be it.@Hurblyburbly No game is perfect, also the last negative is more of a joke, and it's probably partially nit-picking.Easy 11/10. Flawless game!@GamingFan4Lyf Eh, well said man. Game Pass sounds like a great value for sure and I could never argue that. But it does sound kinda anti-completionist for someone like me who likes to platinum games. It would be crummy if I was a the tail end of a game and I lost access to it and I had to buy it on top of paying for the service. But I guess that can go both ways. Oh well like you said, different strokes for different folks.Love how Thesius is one of the cons... 😂 he really is a c***.I love Hades, have it on switch but might end up getting it on playstation just because.Even if you hate roughelikes you will probably like this one, it's well worth a punt if you're on the fence.@HotGoomba We’ll that’s not true is it. There have been many 10/10 games over the years on all systems which in their own right are considered masterpieces (ie perfect)@zupertramp there's also a mode you can toggle that increases your damage resistance each death. This keeps the loop intact, as the narrative relies upon multiple attempts, but it helps anyone who is struggling to make progress.Repeated runs are definitely essential to the core experience but the devs have made the effort to ensure it's accessible and that you can eventually reach the end regardless of your skill level.@Hurblyburbly sorry but that's rubbish. 10/10 might mean 'masterpiece' but nothing is perfect. 10/10 does not equal perfect, it's just an indicator that the person reviewing it can find so little at fault that it deserves the highest praise possible.Give one example of a game that is so perfect that you could literally not improve a single element, no matter how small.@TeapotBuddha You have your opinion and I’ll have mine. There’s been plenty of perfect games over the years on different systems Half life 2 Super Mario world Zelda ocarina of timeGoldeneye Super Mario 64Halo combat evolved Super Mario galaxy. I could go on but I won’t…..Most people would agree they are perfect games and couldn’t be any better….I’m sure you won’t though!@nessisonett Stop talking nonsense they are always harsh on PS Exclusives if you look at Ratched and Clank you know your rant is total bull.@Flaming_Kaiser Was Ratched and Clank that crossover between the PS2 and One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest?@Jeevz it's a completion dream to be honest mate ,the only games I have seen go off gamepass quick is GTA ( 4months of I remember right ) ,I like to get all the achievements on games and there are some that I get after they say they are going off the service, they give u 30 days notice ,but some games have been there for years@nessisonett Did i see somethong else then you a 9 or are you somewhat blind? The game is fantastic why it has been scored a 9 deal with it. There are also a few games i totally loved that got lower rating here then anywhere else so i still by my point.@Quintumply Sorry If you already answered this in the comments, but are there any frame rate issues? I saw in the Pure Xbox review that the game had some frame rate issues, especially when you would enter a new room. I’m curious on if that’s just an Xbox issue or something that both consoles have a problem with. Awesome review btw!@Hurblyburbly all I'll say is, have you tried playing goldeneye in the past 10 years? Using that horrible n64 controller? It's like controlling a drunk on a bouncy castle. What about the shoddy companion AI that has a deathwish?Super Mario galaxy is one of my all time favs and about as close to perfect as you can get imo, but as an example, the camera coulda been better. It's a nitpick, but 🤷🏼‍♂️.Of course we're all entitled to our opinions and I'm happy to agree to disagree. I'll always maintain that true perfection is impossible, but I guess in some instances it amounts to splitting hairs.@TeapotBuddha I’m referring to when they were released not 25 years later! Lol Goldeneye has not aged well at all but most (but not all) games don’t tbh. Absolutely we will have to agree to disagree. No problem with that.@Disharmonist I didn’t spot any frame rate issues at all on PS5.Hades was a game that I think was spoiled for me by the early access. I absolutely loved it to death back when I played it in 2018. Then when the craze happened in 2020, I was kind of underwhelmed, because it didn't really expand all that much.I think I was also the only person who didn't really like the story of it. I think there was just way too much dialogue and I always wanted to get back to the game. I wish the dialogue was presented like in Bastion or Transistor, so that I could learn things without it taking me away from the gameplay.Pros: you can pet Cerberus@Quintumply Do you permanently upgrade yourself in a manner where you can beat the game no matter what?@Quintumply Are there any DualSense capabilities?I’ll just play it on GamePass.I need the cash for Ghost of Tsushima and Arise on PS5.@TheRealist There are a bunch of permanent upgrades that will absolutely help you complete a run. One of them is Death Defiance, which gives you up to three times to cheat death and continue where you otherwise would have died. But there’s nothing so overpowered that you’ll blitz through with no resistance, and the nature of the story is such that you’ll need to make many runs through the underworld no matter what. It’s just how the game is.Again, I think God Mode might be a good option for you; it gives you a defence boost, and each time you die, that boost gets bigger, so you’ll eventually just be so tanky you’ll make it through.@EdwardElric The only thing I noticed is that you can pet Cerberus, the three headed dog in the hub area. When you pet him, hold down L2 and you’ll feel some trigger effects as Zagreus gives Cerberus a scratch. The lights around the touch pad change colour depending on which god you’re talking to, and that’s the extent of it, I believe!@Hurblyburbly You know that’s just plain false. We all think the water temple could be improved in OoT. You might convict yourself, but be real here, no one really agrees with you.The water temple is only one of the infamous things in gaming and an expression because it’s such a hated element of an otherwise great game.@Jaz007
We’ll done. Picking on one segment of one game out of the seven I mentioned off the top of my head….
When Ocarina of Time was released in 1998 no one was moaning about the water Temple. It was an absolute masterpiece and given full marks almost universally by reviewers.
No one had seen or experienced anything like it before.
In the revisions since it’s when people have picked up on the water Temple level design not being as perfect as the rest of the game.@Quintumply I meant to ask, does using things like god mode etc disable trophies?@W0rl0ck Nope!Playing it on Nintendo Switch for a while! This game actually made me a better player! Love it!@jcboyer515 Oh gosh, how wonderful for you. Funny how people can have different experiences of the same thing@Quintumply Ahh good. I messed up my Curse of the Dead Gods save when i used an assist!!Pre-ordered this quite a while ago for PS5, even though I have a Switch, and I'm really looking forward to it.
I hope 365 games likes early releases.@Martsmall Nice man, happy cheevo hunting!Didn't see it in the review but does the game have good optimisation for the dual sense controller, or is it more of an afterthought?Oooo, just had my confirmation that my copy has shipped. squee@nessisonett You mean they might have scored it one pointer higher if it had a PlayStation Studios logo at the front?! Wow. Such out of control biaa!Surprisingly high score, but I'd expect no less. I'll pick this up eventually in a few years when it's dirt cheap.@kris0000 The DualSense's features aren't really put to any meaningful use here, no.@Quintumply OK, thanks.@KidBoruto £20 is dirt cheapThis game is a GOAT contender. Easy 10/10.@AFCC how so? Its 60 fps on Switch too@anoyonmus it has frame drops when not in dock, at least for me!@AFCC well for others it doesn’tPicked this up after all those glowing reviews stating this is a roguelike for people who don't like roguelikes.But no matter how well it plays... it's still a roguelike. Not my cup of tea.@MightyDemon82 Not cheap enough for me, I can wait until it's $15 USD.@anoyonmus don't tell me my switch is busted lol@Hurblyburbly Ummm the reason the revisions were made in later versions was because people bitched about the water temple back when OoT came out. The bitching just wasn't as noticeable because the internet didn't get as big as it was (or is now) when the re-release came out.Now if you go to YouTube and type Problems with original Ocarina of time Water Temple I am sure you will get a ton of videos on it back during the release of it there wasn't YouTube even.Everyone I knew that played OoT on the N64 back in 98 that was their complaint The Water Temple.@AFCC maybe it is.

Hades,David Carcasole,PlayStation Universe,https://www.psu.com/reviews/hades-review-ps5-from-hell-and-back-again-and-again-and-again/," David Carcasole / August 10, 2021Hades PS5 Review – Developer Supergiant’s smash 2020 hit Hades has finally made its way over to PS5 and PS4, after already being available on PC and the Nintendo Switch for some time. It seemed like everyone in the gaming community could do nothing but gush over Hades when it released out of Early Access last year, and for good reason.Simply put, Hades is a once-in-a-generation game for its genre, the kind that not only exceeds the expectations it set for itself, but goes beyond them to evolve the genre in which it exists and become the foundation for years of future developers to build off of.For a more direct comparison, Hades is to roguelike games what Super Mario 64 is to 3D games.Full disclosure: I played quite a fair bit of Hades on PC before getting to experience it on PS5. Though being ported to the PS5 has in the past for some games made the experience better thanks to additional features like full DualSense support or high fidelity visual upgrades, there isn’t any DualSense support to speak of in terms of specifically designed haptics or adaptive trigger functions.The visual design of Hades doesn’t require much in terms of graphical updates, but just needs a solid frame rate for gameplay, which this version thankfully does have.Being honest however, I probably would prefer to not have adaptive triggers or anything like that in Hades. The controls are re-mappable, and if you chose to set your attack to the shoulder or trigger buttons as I did, I could see it having a hinderance on my performance in game, so I’d have it off anyways if it was there.Anyway, with all that housecleaning out of the way, lets talk about what really keeps you going in Hades, and what keeps you motivated for one more run every time you meet a bitter end. In short, it’s family. (Insert Fast & Furious clip here).You play as Zagreus, child to Lord Hades of the Underworld and a mother who he does not know, but wants to, more than anything. In fact, that’s the whole reason Zag wants out of the Underworld in the first place, to find his mother. Along the way you begin to connect with the rest of the ancient Greek gods, as they are just discovering that they have a cousin/nephew.While Hades does also have an excellent combat and upgrade system (which we will delve into later on), it wouldn’t all function so well if not for the narrative, which weaves itself nearly within all aspects of the gameplay.Every single character you meet in the game is solidly designed, which in turn compels you to talk to them and ensures you want to keep coming back in a new run to find out what they have to say about anything. As such, it ensures everything within Hades feel incredibly grounded and real. It also helps that the voice acting is amazing across every character, as well as the writing itself.This combined with the fact every interaction you have with these gods is vital not just to your current run, but future runs as well, and what you get in Hades is a wonderful marriage of story and gameplay interwoven to make you interested in both simultaneously.Supergiant is without a doubt one of the best studios in the industry and their brilliant game design and execution of all its parts in Hades is what makes it a once in a generation game.I don’t wish to spoil any big narrative details, because your discovery of the narrative is vital to the whole experience, but what I will say is that sifting through millennia of family drama between the Olympians in small, short conversations to try and understand how they feel about each other, about your father Hades, and about you will never get boring for me.There is a lot more underneath that, like real family heartbreak and feeling of betrayal, but hearing these gods spill the tea on one another or throw shade is endlessly entertaining.Interesting as each character and the narrative might be, the joy found in each conversation would be sapped if I had to trudge through poorly executed battles. Fortunately, Hades‘ combat system is both very robust and endlessly fun.There are six weapons from which to chose from, though you only start with a few. As you progress you’ll unlock new weapons, though the rate at which you do so is both up to you and up to how quickly you get closer to the surface. If you want to try every weapon as soon as possible, then you’ll need to focus all your collecting of Underworld keys towards unlocking every weapon.Once you do though you’ll notice that they each bring a great amount of variety and depth to the combat, though they all work within a similar framework of dodging and attacking when you have an opening, then quickly dashing to keep yourself moving and out of harms way.Each area has a series of chambers you’ll travel through, most of them being combative ones where you can’t leave until you’ve defeated every enemy. You’ll definitely see the same designs twice, though Tartarus, Asphodel, Elysium and the Temple of Styx each have a very distinct look that helps to keep every chamber you enter feel fresh even if you’ve seen something similar before.Your six weapons are a choice between a sword, a bow, a shield, a spear, a pair of metal fists and an ancient Greek semi-automatic gun. Each weapon has a name and bloody story behind it that dates back thousands of years, some like Coronacht the bow date back to the great war against the titans, others like the shield of Aegis date back to time itself.They’re all very powerful in their own right and the upgrades you can acquire for each of them along the way can make them all very versatile, though it all really comes down to how you like to play. My weapon of choice will almost always be Coronacht, since I prefer to stick with mostly ranged combat and only going in close for a kill when I see an opening.Whether you’re playing with the ‘God Mode’ feature on or not, it doesn’t take much upgrading and time with any one of these weapons to feel like your unstoppable, and as you improve at the combat with each new attempt, ransacking the Underworld and it’s souls with these mythologically powerful weapons gets more and more fun as you play.It also helps that you have multiple conversations with your father, Lord Hades, about how you constantly smash up the Underworld and it is always in need of repairs. Sticking it to your father in this way was not only fun, but it was another great moment of the gameplay and narrative being interwoven, especially for something that doesn’t have a big effect on gameplay at all.When I first played Hades on PC about a month out of its full release, one of the first things I noticed on my monitor was that the game truly looks incredible. The Underworld is still able to be a dark, dreary place without everything having to be different shades of black, grey and brown. Everything is bright and colourful while still feeling ancient, like the last place you would want to end up for eternity.Hades’ sound design and soundtrack also deserve their own shoutout, as often the music will swell at the right moment to help you make that one extra dash or push or attack to keep you going.Everything I’ve experienced playing Hades on PS5 I have mostly already played in one way or another, though I still made new discoveries I hadn’t the first time thanks to different choices I’ve made. Even though I’ve already gone through many of the big moments you have when first playing Hades, they somehow never feel any less than playing through the same parts again.Indeed, this is is really the key element for Hades as a rougelike; you’ll be playing through the same structure all the time but every run will always find a way to feel fresh and different from the last.Aside from that, the initial ending still hits as hard as it did the first time, and while I won’t spoil it like I said earlier, I will reiterate what I said in that there is so much underneath all the family drama and gossip which keeps you interested. It made me emotional when I first played it, and it still was able to hit me in a similar way this time.It’s no surprise at all that the BAFTA Game Of The Year for 2020 arrives on PS5 in top shape, but this release is just another example of how timeless this game truly is. I feel like I’d be hard pressed to every really get bored of Hades, and while I’ve already put in countless hours I know I’m just going to continue putting more time into the game.In fact, while acquiring screenshots of the game and double checking spelling for some terms for this review, I had to shake myself out of a trance because just turning it on was enough to get me playing for a solid 20 minutes before I realized I wasn’t supposed to just be playing another run.Hades is the new gold standard for rougelike games, as it is the whole package and more with excellent gameplay design and combat, wonderful visual design and soundtrack, all wrapped up in an endlessly interesting and entertaining narrative that at its core is about love and family.Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m towards the end of a run that I’d like to continue.Hades is available on PS5 and PS4 on August 13, 2021.Review code generously provided by the publisher.Hades is an absolutely stellar experience that will keep you hooked in from the beginning, with a beautiful visual design and score, not to mention an excellent narrative and intricate gameplay that will keep you coming back again and again for just one more run.

Hades,Paul Sullivan,COGconnected,https://cogconnected.com/review/hades-review/,"Deep beneath Mt. Olympus, and far from the influence of Zeus, the god of the underworld rules supreme over the souls of the dead. His rule is cold and stern, with a vicious bite prepared for those who defy his will. Prince Zagreus has never felt he belongs among the damned. Though he lives comfortably and with considerable prestige among the riff raff of hell, he longs for more. Intrigued by the decadence of Olympus and its denizens, he decides to escape. To do that, he’ll need to die. Repeatedly. Welcome to Hades.Escaping Hades is no easy task. Before reaching ground, Zagreus has to make it through 4 distinct regions including The Temple of Styx, and the fire soaked Asphodel. Each offers a unique set of challenges, and one that evolves with each attempt. Like a lot of games, Hades is a procedural, run based experience. What’s unique, though, is that Hades is superbly paced. From the challenge of simply playing the game, to the mechanics you’ll have to master, to the overarching story of the Prince, there’s a constant positive pressure on your back. Prepare for some late nights, friends: you’re going to be needing “just one more run.”Each, uhhh, night? Does hell have nights? Sure. Each night, Prince Zagreus roams the Hall of Hades before commencing a jailbreak. It’s where you’ll spend the spoils of your previous run, unlocking permanent ability upgrades, new weapons, and, well, redecorating the place. There are an eye watering number of resources and currencies by the time you complete the game, and I’m going to avoid covering them all – I know you’d rather hear about how good this game is than have me churn out a feature list. Right?The hall itself is stacked with interesting residents, including night mother Nyx, the multi-headed dog Cerberus, and the big man himself, Hades. I expected my time in the Hall of Hades to be as limited as possible – just enough to spend some currency and get back to escaping. I was wrong. Developing Zagreus’ relationships with the gods of Hades is supremely interesting. Each one has their own subplot and tale to tell, and you’ll find yourself seeking everyone out each time you return to the hall. It’s all really fun and well written, and packs the information into tiny bites. Interactions never outlasted my patience, and it kept me coming back again and again for those snack sized pieces of lore.But eventually, the time will come to make a run for it. From Supergiant’s trademark ¾ perspective, you’ll dash, slash, and shoot your way through the individual rooms making up Hades. Each one offers some form of reward – boons, obols, upgrades, etc. – and your chosen path guides both your build and the difficulty of your run. It’s a fast and frantic action hybrid, where standing still is a liability and complacency is a death sentence. Still, you feel in complete control of your destiny. Controls are direct, responsive, and with a distinct feeling that each hit you take is your own damn fault. Each of the face buttons maps to an attack or dash, while the timing and situational use of each button press becomes more important the higher you climb. I do wish there were some additional enemies to deal with along the way, and that there was an extra area or two to explore. There’s not exactly a lack of content in Hades, though. Roguelites are naturally repetition focused, but a bit more would have been nice. (DLC? Please?)What I will say is: it feels phenomenal. Perhaps not quite as visceral as Dead Cells, but flexible and satisfying nonetheless. Though I’ve “finished” the game, Hades is one I’ll be coming back to again and again, just because it’s fun.You’re not alone on your quest, either. The Gods of Olympus have taken a particular interest in Zagreus’ mission, and provide boons along the way. The themes of each are predictable, but invisible dice rolls guide their strength and effect on each run. Attempting to curry favour with your preferred benefactors through gifts can stack the deck slightly, but the procedural nature of each run means you’ll generally be working with completely different powers every time. They often stack and interact with one another too, making your moment to moment build decision have lasting implications.As frustrating as that can be in games like this, the balance is truly outstanding. Each of the gods and their boons are of overwhelming power… once you master them. It can be tempting to stick to what you know, but – and this is a recurring theme – you’ll often find that your view of things evolves with your progress.Never feeling stalled or like you’ve hit your ceiling is critical to roguelite games being successful. Hades does this better than any that have come before it, even the fantastic Dead Cells. The key is that progress comes in myriad forms. Major milestones like escaping Tarturus for the first time yield tangible mechanical changes such as unlocking equippable keepsakes, but even less successful (read: awful) runs get you some resources to spend in the Hall of Hades, or perhaps more interestingly, more of the story.Here’s the thing, though: Hades does a remarkable job of making you feel successful, even in the most miserable of failures. That dizzying array of mechanics and choice over the course of a run becomes a trusted ally instead of a hellish burden. After a couple of resounding losses to Megaera (Meg), I started to think more tactically about my boons and route selection. I shifted towards powers that would let me keep my distance, and that resulted in my first key victory. That’s not the amazing part, though.Several runs later, now getting stomped by a Hydra, I realized that those crutches I’d used to get past Meg weren’t quite so helpful in the face of a giant dragon. I went back to the drawing board, mastered a new weapon and tactical set, and adapted to different boons that’d allow for success on two fronts. That’s when it hit me: any grouping of boons, with any weapon, in any situation, can be the winning combination. The balance of it all – likely fueled by Hades’ months in Early Access – is majestic.Even though you’ll be spending a good deal of time in hell, it’ll feel like heaven on your ears. Darren Korb’s soundtrack has incredible range, deftly utilizing howling synths, ripping guitars, and thundering tribal beats among softer, more orchestral arrangements. It’s excellent top to bottom, and easily in “I’d listen to this outside the game” territory.The flavour of the music is matched only by the visual design of Hades. It all looks as though it’s been scrawled onto a piece of parchment, and yet has an incredible vibrance to it. Character portraits take cues from traditional renderings of the Greek gods, but it’s the environmental design that truly blew me away. It looks outstanding in a static shot, but even better in motion. The surfaces and monsters, and backdrops give a great sense of depth, and the use of light and shadow really struck me. It’s far from the most technically complex visual implementation out there, but it’s gorgeous in motion, and again strikes a fine balance between visual legibility and total particle overload. There are viewpoints dotted around your escape route, and I’d often revisit them just to marvel at the beautiful art of it all.Hades is a hell of a good time. It’s tight and responsive, with vast depth beyond the surface levels you’ll need to technically complete it. It looks great, sounds better, and does a masterful job of keeping you moving forward in both story and mechanics. Hades is without doubt one of the best roguelite games to date, a new high point for Supergiant Games, and a dark horse contender for game of the year lists this fall.**PC review code provided by publisher**Developer: Supergiant GamesPublisher: Supergiant Games"
Hades,Rosh Kelly,Wccftech,https://wccftech.com/review/hades-damned-great/,"The image of the Greek Gods is everchanging. Some might not be able to picture Hades without the slick of blue flamed hair thanks to Disney, while others might see him more as a modern depiction of Death or Satan. The Ancient Greeks didn’t have a definitive look for each of the Gods, and the interpretations varied wildly. But for however many versions of Hades, Zeus, Poseidon and the rest there might be, SuperGiant’s Hades will probably always be the pinnacle.And while I’m obviously talking about the game there, SuperGiant have had an incredible art style since Bastion first launched nine years ago, and they have once again beautifully constructed the world and characters in Hades. As you explore the labyrinthine underworld, you’ll get the chance to meet most of the famous Olympians and their underworld counterpart, and its genuinely exciting to see what they look like in this world. It might not always be what you expect, but it is nevertheless a fitting and beautiful design.But beyond falling in love with the Gods of antiquity, Hades is also about Zagreus, the son of the titular God of the Underworld and his many, many attempts at escaping the underworld.SuperGiant have something of a legacy of adding a truly unique spin to a well-established formula, and Hades is no different. Players will recognise the barebones of a roguelike here, albeit lavishly decorated. Each run awards a small progression and incremental bonuses, and with a bit of luck, you can get a little further each time. But while the foundation of the game might feel similar, the rest of the game is nothing like its contemporaries.As you explore the many layers of the underworld, you’ll start gaining access to more and more weapons you can use in your subsequent escape attempts. Each one feels brilliant, with fast, precise, and punchy combat. Each strike feels perfectly weighted for the weapon, from the swing of the sword to the punch of the fists. On top of that, each weapon comes with a special attack, like the bows spread of arrows of the spears javelin throw, and your ability to cast out a red diamond that can damage. To avoid attacks you’ll have ready access to the dash, that lets you escape damage and navigate across the many traps and pitfalls in each of the chambers your explore. All of these make up the basics of the combat and on their own are a lovely, simple, familiar combat system to build a foundation on.But from there the Gods have other designs. Throughout your journey, you’ll reap many boons, and the most exciting are favours from the Gods. These augment your abilities in various ways, and can completely change the way you play run to run. Zeus obviously imbues your attacks with lightning, while Hermes offers speed. Ares adds additional damage to each swing and Athena lets you turn enemy attacks back on yourself. While you might develop favourites as you make your way through, there’s no guarantee who you’ll meet along the way so you best be ready to experiment and adapt each time you play.This constant change is really effective for making the game feel free for hundreds of hours. Not only do the rooms and enemies change, but so does the way you play. And while other roguelikes offer different equipment and bonuses for different runs, none of them are so expressive and varied as one escape attempt compared to another in Hades.That said, Hades isn’t the pure roguelike you might expect. For better or worse, it is still a SuperGiant game and comes with their own brilliant storytelling that should not be ignored. While most roguelikes offer a small respite between runs where you can manage your upgrades and take a breath, Hades offers a lot more, but it is a lot more time consuming.Having been slain by the Bone Hydra, one of the Furies or caught short by a random enemy that got the better of you, you’ll probably be desperate to leap straight back out the window and start another run. But for the true Hades experience, for the true SuperGiant experience, you’ll have to slow yourself down. Each run begins in the House of Lord Hades, filled with interesting figures that you can have brief conversations with. From Nyx to Achilles to Hades himself, these conversations filled in the lore of the world, as well as your own quest.Your attempted escape from the underworld, the reason the other Gods are willing to aid you, and even the reason that Hades wants to keep you below are all explored in these conversations, delightfully teased out and hinted it as you progress each run. They are expertly written and performed, and so very interesting to watch unfold. SuperGiant have spent a lot of time and effort crafting these characters and to dismiss it is to miss on a whole section of the game worthy of your time, even if you can’t wait to get back into the action.Missing these also overlooks potential bonuses in combat as well. On your journey, you might come across Nectar, the food of the Gods. This can be gifted to the various NPCs you’ll meet in the House and on the road who might just offer you a keepsake as a reward for such a lovely treat. This, on top of the Darkness and keys you’ll also collect throughout the underworld, are the primary ways in which you can improve your chances going forward. At first you’ll have no clue what each door symbol means as you race through the underworld chambers looking for an exit. But it doesn’t take look to learn what each reward can do and start making the right decision for your run each time you come to a fork in the road.I haven’t even had the chance to mention the music, another staple in SuperGiant games and Hades is by far one of the best soundtracks that Darren Korb has scored so far, blending the unique sound of a SuperGiant game with something that fits so well within the halls and fields of the Greek underworld.Hades is a fantastic game. While the soundtrack and visuals are unsurprisingly brilliant, everything else about is polished to the same bold, confident strokes. The story is much more gripping then it appears and is immersive for even the most fair-weather of Greek mythology fans. The combat is everchanging, ever exciting. The progression is satisfying, well-paced and you’ll always have a goal besides the simple desire to escape. There is, in short, not a single overstanding issue with Hades, and should any judge of the damned ever find the need to evaluate it, they would surely put it in the highest echelons of the afterlife.Reviewed on PC. Hades is near perfect, offering exactly what you expect and yet somehow exceeding your wildest expectations. From the art design to the gameplay to the narrative, Hades is proof of the incredible creative power that SuperGiant Games have been honing for the last nine years.Subscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox© 2023 WCCF TECH INC.

Hades,Jason Rodriguez,PC Invasion,https://www.pcinvasion.com/hades-review-pc/,"Supergiant Games, the developer of Bastion, Transistor, and Pyre, has a new action rogue-lite title, Hades, and a lot could be said about it. The first thing would be that it’s, hands down, an amazing game as you’ll find out in our official review.First released in December 2018 as an Epic Games Store exclusive, Hades eventually made its way to Steam. Throughout this period, it remained an Early Access title. Its dedicated fans saw the trials and tribulations and additional content being introduced. Now, the recent 1.0 release/official launch isn’t just icing on the cake even if you’ve been trying the game for a while. It actually ties the entire narrative together while giving you more reasons to continue playing. Assuming you’re a newcomer, well, let’s just say you’re in for one helluva great time.Hades puts you in the shoes of Zagreus, the son of, uh, Hades, God of the Underworld. The two are at odds, and Zagreus is more than happy to rebel and escape the depths of Tartarus. That’s the beginning of your journey. Along the way, you’ll meet a wonderful cast of characters from Greek mythology.To say that Hades merely borrows from myths would be an understatement. It’s inspired by Greek mythology in many ways, sure. But, it’s also a fanciful retelling with many twists, keeping you engaged as you discover characters and as the story moves forward.For a game set in the world of the dead, the developers have crafted something that comes to life. The motivations of the characters are wonderfully written, their personalities striking and unique, and the art design is nothing short of gorgeous. You’ll laugh and cheer at certain moments whether it’s meeting Megaera’s sisters (the other Furies), gaining the blessings of an Olympian, helping the lovers Orpheus and Eurydice reconnect, or just petting Cerberus.How exactly do you move the story forward? Well, that’s done by going through multiple zones in the Underworld. From the dungeons of Tartarus, you’ll eventually reach the lava flows of Asphodel and then the fields of Elysium. Finally, you’ll make your way to the Temple of Styx. Each zone is capped off by a boss fight. There’s one involving the aforementioned Furies, another with Theseus and the Minotaur, the secret boss Charon, and, of course, Hades himself. Make no mistake: the game will often challenge and test your mettle whether you’re duking it out with elite mobs, unique encounters, bosses, or the “alternate versions” of those bosses.Repetition, a common fixture in the rogue-lite genre, is a given. However, your runs always lead to new developments. Perhaps Zagreus died in one of the zones — that still counts as an escape attempt. Once you respawn in the House of Hades, the game’s hub, you might discover additional dialogue from various characters. If you managed to complete a successful run, then, naturally, there’d be some semblance of the story advancing further (which I’ll get into detail later). The changes will matter too. For instance, the moment Zagreus called the Lernaean Bone Hydra “Lernie,” the game started to refer to that boss by that nickname. In another example, when Zagreus met a particular character, others chimed in about that individual.Likewise, time investment versus failures and starting from scratch — a dilemma that’s evident in the genre — won’t create issues. Most clears will last 20 to 30 minutes (even shorter for failed attempts). Hades even lets you carry over several resources and items that could be used to gain weaponry, character boosts, and cosmetic designs in your abode. The point is that your runs aren’t wasted since you’re progressing in some way, shape, or form.Retracing your steps and redoing your runs would be a problem, though, if the combat itself isn’t exciting. Thankfully, Hades manages to excite and entertain in this regard. This is due to the core mechanics and exploration. Every zone in Hades has multiple rooms filled with encounters. You’re often given a choice of which room to enter with an icon showing what you can obtain. Perhaps it’s an item/resource such as gemstones or nectar; perhaps you’d get a boon from a god.After battling your foes, you’d get your reward. If it’s a boon, this will either replace your attack, special, dash, or casting abilities, or provide you with a passive/support skill. You could zap foes with Zeus’ lightning, push them back with Poseidon’s waves, or freeze them with Demeter’s chilling effects. Meanwhile, Athena lets you block projectiles, Ares lets you throw spinning blades, Aphrodite weakens and charms hostiles, Artemis empowers your critical hits, and Hermes provides movement and utility support.The game’s boons or skill system tends to have a ton of depth as well. There are various levels and rarities, heroic versions, legendary versions, and duo boons — a skill that’s made available if you’ve already found requirements from two gods.It doesn’t stop there. Throughout your journey, you might meet with Primordial Chaos (an entity that provides a buff after getting hampered for several encounters). There might be an Infernal Gate challenge that you could complete to net you improved versions of skills. Heck, you could even stumble upon a Trial of the Gods. This lets you choose between two Olympians to gain their boon. The one you don’t pick gets mad, and you’ll need to kill mobs while that Olympian’s spell attempts to damage you.Hades‘ mechanics are complex, intricate, and interconnected; discussing one would mean you’d have to go into detail to explain another. I mean that in a good way. Hades has a depth that’s unparalleled and unrivaled by most games.No two runs will ever feel the same. Even if you’re going through the same zones or rooms, or battling the same enemies, the fact that you could be using different weapons and getting different rewards would be enough to alter your playstyle. Because of RNG factors, there’s a good chance that one attempt will give you everything you’d need to survive early on, whereas the next one might gimp you until you reach later stages.As mentioned earlier, progression is a given. By learning more about Hades‘ supporting cast, you’ll strengthen your bonds and relationships. This could yield Keepsakes (accessories that provide benefits during your escape attempts), companions that can be summoned, and even a bit of romance. As for the resources I mentioned, you’ll eventually use the Pact of Punishment which is a main component of the gameplay loop. It adds modifiers to make your playthroughs slightly more challenging. In turn, you’ll earn rarer resources such as Titan’s Blood, Diamonds, and Ambrosia — i.e., the Titan’s Blood is used to unlock alternative versions of weapons such as the Aspect of Gilgamesh.The Aspect of Gilgamesh is just one of the new additions that’s part of Hades‘ 1.0 release. The biggest inclusion, arguably, is the true ending. During the Early Access period, defeating Hades automatically led to Zagreus’ death as though he’s stuck in a Groundhog Day time loop set in Ancient Greece.I won’t spoil much, but, with the official launch, Zagreus will finally achieve his goal of meeting a special individual. Your adventure doesn’t stop there because the true ending can only be achieved by speaking with this person a total of 10 times (that means more successful escape attempts). The ending itself might be one of the best I’ve seen in any game. It’s fairly simple and yet so effective because it ties together the entire plot. Surprisingly enough, the narrative even suggests why you need to continue playing. Yes, the reason to keep grinding in a rogue-lite is very lore-friendly given how it relates to Greek mythology.Furthermore, obtaining the true ending will unlock late-game features such as cosmetic badges, a couple of Keepsakes, extra dialogue and banter with characters, as well as a modifier to have an absolutely nailbiting boss fight. There’s also an epilogue which has you doing more clears.As noted earlier, Hades is an amazing game and one of the most memorable ones I’ve ever played. It runs like a dream too. I didn’t experience any crashes, and there was nary a framerate drop even when some of the fights turned into “bullet hell” or frantic scenarios. Thanks to the top-notch performance that’s not too demanding on rigs, you won’t see incidents where you’d incur random deaths due to random mishaps or clunkiness.Perhaps the only point of contention I’d have, as it relates to hardware, is that using a gamepad is recommended. The controls are tight and responsive, but it’s definitely a lot more comfortable to use a gamepad over a mouse and keyboard setup.In any case, if you’ve been following Hades since the Early Access period, then you’ve got some extra activities to do now that the 1.0 version is available. If you’re a newcomer or beginner and you’re going in blind, you’re bound to have a refreshing, challenging, and thoroughly engaging experience. I genuinely can’t wait for additional DLC in the future. It’s not because Hades feels “incomplete.” Rather, it’s because it’s already complete — you can’t help but want more, and you know that Supergiant Games will do an excellent job at it.Hades is an absolutely phenomenal game. Its characters are brilliantly written, and the worldbuilding and lore are top-notch. The combat mechanics are refreshing, intricate, and unbelievably deep. Its replayability and fun factor will keep you continuing onward with Zagreus' adventure well after the true ending and epilogue. This is one title you wouldn't want to miss out on.About Us

Supergiant Games might be one of my favorite developers of all time—I loved Bastion and Pyre, and Transistor is probably one of my favorite games ever—but I missed Hades when it first released last year on Switch and PC. Though I’d heard how the latest from Supergiant was lauded and laden with awards, I was holding out hope that it would one day get a PlayStation release. I avoided even looking into the game outside of what occasionally came across my Twitter feed. I’d seen the game’s art, but I knew virtually nothing else about Hades beyond what it looked like and that it was apparently pretty award worthy. That patience paid off, and I got to go into Hades on the PS5 completely fresh a couple of weeks ago. And I get it now.Hades is good. Hades is really, really good. Hades is the kind of game awards were made for. Hades is undeniably a Supergiant game, but at the same time so different from every Supergiant game that came before it. Its art style is stunning, using subtle almost unnoticeable flecks and streaks of bright neon colors to make the environments in the underworld pop. Its story is a thrilling mystery with deep and complex characters. Its combat and (literal) gameplay loop is engaging and fun, stopping short of ever feeling repetitive—despite its very nature of asking players to venture back through the Underworld multiple times.Zagreus, son of Hades, is attempting to escape the Underworld. Along the way, he is aided by assorted gods, who send him boons and blessings that modify each escape attempt. Zeus might give your attack the ability to emit chain lightning. Athena grants abilities that deflect enemy attacks. Hermes’ boons are all based on modifying your speed in some way. Each chamber throughout the Underworld houses a new reward to aid that run (or perhaps something to spend on more permanent upgrades for future escape attempts). And it’s not just Olympian boons. Keys, darkness, gems, obols, health upgrades; there are a lot of things to collect along the way, much of which is lost should you fall in your attempt to leave the Underworld.There’s a healthy balance between randomness and providing some player choice. Sometimes you’ll get multiple doors; the ability to choose which chamber you want to enter next, and each will show what reward you’ll gain. Do you want that boon from Ares, or perhaps are you a little short on obols for the boatman Charon this run? Maybe you’re trying to collect gems to fix up the House of Hades? Even when getting boons from the Olympians or picking weapon upgrades with the Hammer of Daedalus, you’re offered from a selection of three choice to best tailor your build. Some runs aren’t anything special, and some can turn into delightfully unexpected combinations of chaos that empower you in ways you didn’t even know possible when you first jumped out of Zag’s bedroom window.There’s a lot of mystery surrounding his attempts to leave, but each time Zagreus dies, he is sent back to the Pool of Styx in the House of Hades—minus most of his collected boons, weapon upgrades, and obols—where he can talk to various house servants to learn more. The voice acting in Hades is so good, I never skipped any spoken dialog. It’s paced such that characters never drone on for overly long, and it’s a joy to hear every interaction that Zagreus has with various denizens of the Underworld and Olympian gods, paired with beautiful portraits of each character. Honestly, I was just as eager to spend time in the House of Hades as I was to make my way through the Underworld fighting shades and other nasty things that would have me sent back again.Not only is the voice acting itself phenomenal, but the prompts that create these dynamic and unique interactions are always incredible. I can’t fathom how much recorded dialog must be in this game. I am still hearing unique voice lines based on things like what types of enemies I get killed by, what weapon I use, and what specific aspect (form) of a weapon I choose. There’s dialog based on which gods’ boons you’ve acquired earlier in a run. There’s assorted character side stories that interweave with Zagreus’ escape attempts. It’s a staggering amount of unique dialog that continues to deliver the story to the player whether you complete a run or fail early on. I did get to a point around 30 hours in that I started hearing some generic repeat voice overs on collecting boons from gods, but Hades is structured in such a way that it’s hardly noticeable.Hades is what I would hold up as a prime example of the perfect integration of roguelite elements. It’s the perfect blend of the formula, using story and the world to introduce various gameplay mechanics. Nothing about Hades feels ancillary or tacked on. Everything feels like it has a reason to exist. That’s a trademark staple of Supergiant Games titles—nothing about the game will ever pull you out of the world or the game experience. It’s all integrated in brilliant and creative ways that serve to deepen every part’s meaning. Mechanics and gameplay systems. Music and story. Modifiers and replayability. Every facet of Hades is embedded flawlessly within, virtually indiscernible as its own separate piece.Part of that integration is empowering players to take on the challenges however they want to. There are myriad options to try to tailor Hades to exactly how you want to play, or to let you chase your own specific goals. Even before starting a run, there are a ton of options and “permanent” upgrades that persist to choose from. There’s the Mirror of Night that offers a variety of enhancements. There are six weapons—the Infernal Arms—to choose from, each with four additional “aspects,” or forms that can have wildly different abilities and ways to play. There’s the cabinet full of keepsakes which can provide modifiers like increasing the likelihood of getting a certain god’s boon, or giving you a last chance with additional health should you fall. I cannot stress enough how every single run feels unique.And then within each run, the assorted chamber rewards can entirely change the game. Weapons that I wasn’t previously fond of became some of my favorites via the right combination of boons and upgrades. Unique and rare Duo Boons let two gods’ abilities work together for even more interesting effects. Daedalus’ Hammer will give you the choice of anything from increasing damage to entirely changing how a weapon’s attacks work. And there are quite a few other systems at play that I won’t go into detail about here. Suffice to say, death or failure never felt unfair to me, even with the randomization of rewards, because I had enough freedom to choose how I play. Each time I was sent back to the Pool of Styx was a learning experience, and also came with other opportunities to grow or chase specific things within the House of Hades.Hades always feels like its delivering something new to the player. Whether it’s player discovery via emergent systems, or carefully doled out gameplay elements and mechanics that keep things feeling fresh, the pacing is handled perfectly. Little surprises crop up throughout, elements that I don’t want to spoil. They kept—and still keep—me eager to discover new things; to find what bits of narrative or gameplay might be unearthed next. Win or lose, Hades never lets up, encouraging new runs (much to the detriment of my ability to get to bed anytime before 1 am for the last two weeks). You can save and quit at the beginning of any chamber—avoiding an issue people had with Returnal—if you need to step away at any time, though for the sake of knowing what boons and abilities I was working with (and as an excuse to keep playing), I tended to only stop between runs, if indeed I was ever forced to stop playing at all.And there are many ways that Hades encourages you to deviate away from what you are most comfortable with. Chasing down tasks on the Fated List allowed me to utilize certain modifiers and boons I may not have otherwise gravitated towards. While I could certainly stay in my comfort zone and go with what I know feels powerful, Hades always felt like it was empowering me to discover new ways that other abilities and modifiers might be useful. There are a lot of great risk/reward elements throughout, or areas that offer two different but meaningful choices that allow the player to really think about how they’ll get through a run. But again, many of these systems are doled out at a comfortable pace that allows for testing the waters, rather than kind of dumping everything on the player at once. It keeps the new discoveries as a satisfying drip feed, rather than an overwhelming burden.The PlayStation versions of Hades aren’t any different from last year’s Switch and PC versions. The PS5 version doesn’t have any special PS5-specific features besides the ability to run the game in absolutely beautiful 4K, which brings Hades‘ unique and vibrant visuals to life. However, don’t expect any DualSense integration, at least at launch. There’s no word on if Supergiant might work on adding it later. (Edit: There actually is DualSense support for haptic feedback, though to me, it didn’t feel utilized to the extent that other games, particularly first-party titles, use it.)I haven’t felt this drawn to a game in a long time. Hades is fully deserving of every award that it has earned, and PlayStation players finally get to experience this perfected Supergiant Games masterpiece on PS4 and PS5. It’s an utterly brilliant melding of narrative, art, music, gameplay, world, and characters, with unique details throughout each element that come together to create a game unlike any other. Hades bears the mark of being a Supergiant game, while never feeling like it retreads any of the developer’s past work. Rather it builds on everything they’ve learned. It’s a triumph of player choice and discovery, consistently engaging, and always begging for just one more escape attempt.Hades review code provided by developer. Reviewed on PS5.

Hades,Brad Lang,Critical Hit,https://www.criticalhit.net/gaming/hades-review-greece-lightning/,"Here we go again, talking about another roguelike game. Honestly, we’re at a point of saturation in the genre that when Hades slid across my desk I was exhausted. Not feeling the passion or energy to actually invest time in the game, I set aside a few hours a day, ready to play it for a week just for this review. I was just doing my job, almost adamant that it was going to strike the same chords as every other indie rogue-like either poorly or very well. I’m a diehard fan of roguelikes but we’ve reached a point where it’s difficult to really get excited about a new one. They all pull from the same general bag of tricks and unless there’s something special in the mix, most of them become tedious sessions of mindless starting runs, dying, and repeating the cycle. So I fired Hades up about an hour before my usual bedtime, not expecting much. Then the hour came to turn my lights off and I was still playing. Another hour came and went and… I was still going. On and on, it went until I forced myself to put down my Switch. I’m now utterly blown away by Hades and after having spent days sinking time into the game’s world, combat, and characters, I can safely say Hades isn’t just the best rogue-like of the year, it might be one of the best rogue-likes ever made.Drawing heavily from Greek mythology, you’ll play as Zagreus as he does his best to escape the underworld, the realm of his manipulative father Hades. To do so you’ll have to slay hundreds of enemies as you push through the various realms of the dead, so that you can eventually walk free amongst the gods of Olympus. It’s rare that a rogue-like’s mechanics mesh so neatly with its mechanics yet, much like the tale of Sisyphus stuck in his eternal punishment of pushing a boulder up a hill, the constant repetition of fight, die, and repeat works in the context of world it’s set in. Developer Supergiant knows this and works with the setting to create a roguelike that doesn’t feel “gamey”, if I can use such a word and not lose any credentials. Hades doesn’t play like a roguelike despite having the features that fit the bill. It plays like an action game that just happens to share similarities with the roguelike genre, making it both stand out from the pack but also makes it more accessible to folks who might be hesitant to dip their toes into the genre.Which is something else that Hades absolutely nails: Seamlessly juggling challenging, punishing gameplay with a constant stream of upgrades and rewards. Most notably, every run in Hades feels important in some way. Whether it be finally earning enough gemstones to upgrade the House of Hades through a plethora of tangible improvements, or listening to a new conversation with a cast of colourful characters who actively comment on your performance, there’s always something new to experience and uncover. As ironic as it sounds, there’s a life to Hades, a vibrancy to being surrounded by characters that are actively taking note of both your accomplishments and failures, spurred on by some excellently witty dialogue and top-tier voice acting. I reached a point in my time with Hades when I realised that I wasn’t embarking on new runs to just unlock new weapon aspects or gain some more darkness to upgrade Zagreus; I was doing it because Hades kept telling me that I was a fool to keep trying and that kind of attitude deserves to be proven wrong, especially when it’s said in the most condescending, passive-aggressive way possible.I haven’t even touched on the combat yet, which continues Supergiant’s reputation for delivering thoughtful yet utterly satisfying action. With a range of unlockable (and vastly upgradable) weapons that each play differently, Hades manages to maintain a freshness in its combat situations, not least of all because of the mountain of perks (or “boons” from the gods) that you find during your escape attempts. Variety keeps Hades fresh as it never forces you into a particular play style of “meta-building” that’s noticeably more powerful than anything else. Everything is viable, placing the onus on the player to learn the ins and outs of each weapon and the world they find themselves in to optimise their runs. Having played plenty of roguelikes, it’s rare that one implements a system that feels so fundamentally rewarding to master while never becoming overly-repetitive. Hades’ combat system is as deep as it is wide, allowing clueless players to feel powerful on their first attempt while still retaining that sensation of being an unstoppable (yet fragile) force of the Underworld for folks that have mastered the game several times over.I’ve played a lot of roguelikes in the past few years. Everyone’s going on about battle royales being the craze and in a AAA sense that may be true, yet in the indie scene roguelikes have held a much more dominant state of influence for some time now. Most of them turn out to be average at best because, let’s be honest, creating a game where repeating the core experience over and over again must be exceptionally challenging. Yet Supergiant, as they always do, have managed to breath life into a genre that’s becoming more stale by the month. Hades isn’t just an exceptional roguelike, it’s an all-round marvel of a video game that’s clearly been developed with a great deal of love and passion on every aspect: From the character art and designs to the combat, everything feels hand-crafted in a way you just don’t see all that often. I started this off by saying that Hades might be one of the best roguelikes ever made and while I’m not sure how true such a statement can be, what I do know is that it’s undeniably one of the best games of the year.Last Updated: September 21, 2020

Hades,Jordan Minor,PCMag,https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/hades-for-pc,"A trip to Hell worth taking again and again and againIn 2013, I started my Ziff Davis career as an intern on PCMag's Software team. Now, I’m an Analyst on the Apps and Gaming team, and I really just want to use my fancy Northwestern University journalism degree to write about video games. I host The Pop-Off, PCMag's video game show. I was previously the Senior Editor for Geek.com. I’ve also written for The A.V. Club, Kotaku, and Paste Magazine. I’m currently working on a book about the history of video games, and I’m the reason everything you think you know about Street Sharks is a lie.Beautiful art, ingenious combat, and a clever plot structure make Hades a stunning example of the often polarizing roguelite genre.When I downloaded Hades, I feared it would be hellish, and not just because the game takes place in the Greek mythological underworld. Hades is a roguelite–a less punishing variation of a roguelike–which might be my all-time least favorite video game genre due to its emphasis on constant death without tangible progress. Though Hades can’t hide the genre's flaw, its endlessly replayable combat and storytelling that takes advantage of the looping structure elevate the format like no game before. Miraculously, it has become one of my favorite PC games of the year.Whereas most roguelite stories are nothing but thin pretexts for the infinite action, Hades wants you to invest in its narrative. Hades is the newest game from Supergiant Games. The developer’s house style, present in previous releases like Bastion and Transistor, shines brightly in Hades, too. A key part of that style is a rich plot with well-written, well-realized, well-acted characters. Impressively, the game’s identity manages to stand out despite being rooted in the extremely familiar world of Greek mythology. You won’t confuse this with Assassin’s Creed Odyssey or God of War.You play as Zagreus, hunky prince of the underworld and sulking son of Lord Hades himself. Each run represents an attempt to escape from the underworld to the mortal world on the surface, away from your wrathful father and back towards your unknown mother. Along the way you encounter your highfalutin Greek god relatives, from Artemis to Zeus, eager to help you come home to Olympus. Each death sends you back beneath Tartarus to the bloody pool in the House of Hades, where you interact with fellow dark residents to further the plot or just pet your three-headed dog Cerberus. Hades structures its entire plot around the fact that you’ll die and play again many times. Even after you “beat” the game once you won’t entirely know what’s going on. Supergiant’s previous game Pyre used a similar gimmick, but it feels much more at home within the roguelite structure. Furthering your relationships with whatever Greek deities you encounter during a particular run encourages you to continue no matter how hard the challenges get. You’ll seek out these characters not only because they give gameplay upgrades (although fellow punished soul Sisphyus does give good upgrades). You'll seek them because they are compelling characters. The more I talk with Orpheus and Eurydice, the more I can listen to their haunting vocal tracks. The more I realized how cool Megaera “Meg” the Fury is, the more tragic it is whenever I inevitably slay her during a boss fight. To experience this story, you need to do a lot of fighting. Fortunately, Hades’ combat matches its narrative when it comes to gripping you and never letting go. Hades' fighting harkens back to Bastion's straightforward action-RPG combat, which itself recalled genre standard-bearer Diablo. I wonder if even the name Hades itself is an allusion to Diablo naming itself after an evil god.In Hades, you fight waves of enemies inside isometric dungeons. You always go through the same four action-packed worlds, and generally fight the same bosses at the end of each of them, but the individual layouts change every time. Sometimes, you’ll catch a break and enter a room with just an item shop or healing fountain. Other times, a minotaur ambushes you before you’re officially supposed to fight him.Fortunately, level layouts aren’t the only things that drastically change. I spent hours experimenting with the intricacies of Hades’ combat and felt like I only scratched the surface. At the beginning of each run, you choose a weapon. The fast, close-quarters sword slashing requires a drastically different playstyle than the long-range bow. The shield, which works as a melee weapon, as well as a Captain America-style throwing weapon, opens up its own strategies.Your weapon is just the start, though. During your run, gods offer you various Boons–abilities that customize your playstyle even further. The possibilities feel almost as endless as the game itself. In my first successful run, I used a Boon that cut down my max health in exchange for a sword that recovered health with every normal attack hit. Meanwhile, my dash summoned waves in my wake, thanks to Poseidon, while my special attack left enemies as drunk and slow as guests at one of Dionysus’ parties. That’s just a fraction of the synergies you can come up with. Maybe you’ll opt for Aphrodite’s love or Demeter’s chill? Some Boons activate a new ability once your God Gauge fills up, like Athena’s shield that protects and deflects. Others augment a limited projectile you have called a Cast, so enemies you hit with your Cast may suffer Ares’ Doom damage. Knowing how enemies behave also influences your combat decisions. Safely take down lumbering giants from afar, or quickly murder swarms of vermin before they release toxic gas. I never got tired of mixing and matching combinations to find the most fun and overpowered builds possible. Think God of War meets Gunstar Heroes. Seeing which potential Boon or upgrade you might acquire behind each dungeon door actively shapes how you chose to tackle the random levels. Like the story, exploring the depths of the combat encouraged me to play Hades again and again.   Hades can be a very difficult game. That’s a staple of the genre; you don’t make combat this excellent and not demand players learn it inside and out. While you only have about four buttons to actively worry about (light attack, special attack, dash, Cast) everything happens so quickly you need to constantly pay attention, to the point where you reach an intoxicating instinctive-driven Zen state. To go back to Diablo comparisons, it plays like Diablo at three times the speed, with a sprinkling of bullet hell. I played with a controller because I didn’t think constantly clicking a mouse could keep up and feel comfortable. However, I appreciate the generous difficulty options. Hades doesn’t have to be too punishing to be enjoyable. As a flexible roguelite, not a strict roguelike, you gain permanent upgrades after each run. Various currencies unlock damage boosts, extra lives, and weapon-specific buffs. Giving gifts to the gods unlocks keepsakes that guarantee you access to their Boons when you start a run, if you want to somewhat shape your playstyle instead of leaving it totally up to the Fates. And activating God Mode permanently boosts your overall defense every time you die. Since I have no shame, I used all of these perks and can now beat the game in about half an hour. This solves my biggest issues with roguelikes: Constant, arbitrary death that wastes my time for no reason and with no tangible reward. Compare that to Spelunky, a game that flat-out frustrates. Hades’ digestible length also frequently tricked me into doing multiple “one last runs” per session to test new skills. Conversely, upping the difficulty through the Pact of Punishment modifiers provides a satisfying challenge for those looking to push themselves. It’s also the fastest way to grind for the special Titan Blood currency necessary for truly unlocking everything the game has to offer.That said, Hades still heavily relies on the repetition inherent to the roguelike structure. The plot contorts itself in fascinating ways to justify the rebirths, and the combat makes grinding a joy, but the game still wants you to fight the same enemies in the same places again and again. Previous Supergiant Games were short, tight experiences. Hades lasts much longer, and has added plenty of new content and character interactions since launching in Early Access two years ago. Still, I couldn’t escape the nagging sense that the entire conceit’s true purpose is to keep players more engaged for longer periods of time through somewhat artificial means.Another part of Supergiant’s house style is impeccable art direction. Hades is no different. 3D characters dart around illustrated backgrounds. The artwork conveys the radically different moods of the environments you encounter while using classic, ancient Greek aesthetics to tie everything together. The flaming rivers of Asphodel give way to Elysium’s idyllic blue realm of eternal champions. Meanwhile, lovingly detailed, dating sim-esue character portraits have inspired a level of online thirst not seen since Overwatch's early days.To play the game on PC, you need a computer that houses at least a Dual Core 2.4GHz CPU, a 1GB VRAM GPU with DirectX 10 support, 4GB of RAM, and 15GB of storage. The graphics, while stunning, aren’t super demanding. However, on weaker machines the normally 60-frames-per-second action may exhibit slight slowdown when tons of enemies and graphical effects appear on screen at once. It's hardly noticeable and never game-breaking, though. As a Steam game, Hades supports nearly 50 Steam Achievements, Steam Cloud Saves, Steam Trading Cards, and Remote Play on TV, phone, and tablet. Accessibility options include subtitles, displaying damage numbers, and the ability to turn of screen shaking.The game also runs on Nintendo Switch, which also suffers from very minor slowdown, and both versions will soon have cross-save support. I’m not sure if Hades is my absolute favorite Supergiant Games release. Transistor remains criminally underrated. Hades, however, is the one I’ve spent the most time playing and thinking about. It’s the rare roguelite that convinces me of the genre’s merits. Hades masterfully nails its minute-to-minute mechanics alongside the larger character and story progression. I didn’t want to love Hades, but still loved it. I love looking at, fighting in, and absorbing more of this underworld that never stops. So, if you come in with an even slightly more open mind, chances are you’ll love it even more. Stay up to date with all of our latest PC game coverage by joining PCMag's Steam Curator(Opens in a new window) page.

Hades,Todd Rigney,We Got This Covered,https://wegotthiscovered.com/gaming/hades-review/,"  I play a lot of roguelites these days. Since my debatably precious free time seems to diminish with each passing day, run-based games fit quite nicely into my hectic schedule. Instead of sitting down for hours at a time with a title that requires a huge investment, I can scratch the proverbial itch in something like Enter the Gungeon or Slay the Spire without feeling as though I’m working a part-time job (I’m looking at you, Assassin’s Creed Odyssey). Not only that, but they’re an absolute blast to play; despite the hate that roguelites seem to attract, meta progression and unlockables have become my drug of choice. I seem to love them all equally, regardless of their shortcomings.Enter Hades, the latest endeavor from Bastion developer Supergiant Games. Remember way back in the opening paragraph when I said that roguelites were perfect bite-sized games that didn’t require oodles and oodles of my oh-so-precious spare time in one sitting? Hades doesn’t play by those rules. Hades wants all of my time, seeping into my thoughts when I’m trying to do some work or focus on things like preparing dinner or trying to get some sleep. Hades demands total submission, and I’m willing to obey. It’s the perfect roguelite, offering a wealth of content in addition to a wonderful story powered by a remarkable voice cast and gorgeous artwork. I want to mainline Hades directly into my brain so I can experience the rush at all hours of the day. If I could program my mind to experience the joys of Hades while I slept, then I would throw all of my hard-earned money at that bleeding-edge roguelite-based technology.Enough hyperbole. But seriously, Hades rocks.Folks who immediately roll their eyes whenever they hear the term roguelite will probably have a lot of negative things to say about Hades at first glance. From the outset, it seems to check all the boxes associated with the genre. Meta progression? Check. Randomized levels? Check. RNG tomfoolery? Check. And I won’t argue the point. Hades is most definitely a roguelite from top to bottom, but here’s the thing: Supergiant Games knows what people have come to expect from these experiences. Hades nimbly subverts all of your expectations. It’s almost as if the developers took a deep dive into the seemingly endless supply of roguelite titles on Steam and made a running list of the things they wanted to do differently — and then they knocked it completely out of the park. So, yes, by definition, Hades sits alongside other like-minded games, but this offering provides so much more than its contemporaries. The end result is staggering.First, we need to talk about the story, which will immediately charm and impresses. You play Zagreus, the dashingly handsome Prince of the Underworld, though he’s not particularly thrilled about his station in life. Apparently, being the prince of this realm is pretty boring and mundane, and he’s had his fill of it. So, instead of hanging around the Underworld, Zagreus decides to make a break for it. Unfortunately, trying to escape isn’t as easy as it sounds on paper. His father, the gruff and grumpy Hades, thinks his quest for emancipation is a lost cause, but that doesn’t mean much to Zagreus. He’s a young prince on a mission, and regardless of how many times he encounters defeat during his seemingly endless journey, he keeps pushing forward. The guy is definitely headstrong, for better and for worse.Fortunately, Zagreus has plenty of help along the way. His estranged family, comprised of many famous Olympians, decide to help Zagreus escape from the depths of the Underworld. To make that happen, they offer up a wide variety of different buffs and power-ups, which often give our hero a leg up on the dozens of nefarious enemies that stand in his way. Of course, these varied advantages will only work if you know how to use them. properly. You’ll definitely need to sharpen your skills if you hope to survive. Supergiant has balanced this game to perfection, and it’s fun to experiment with the different synergies. If one build doesn’t line up with your playstyle, then chances are there’s another combination that will help you make it to the end of your run with your hide intact.Since this is a roguelite, the advantages you receive from your Olympian pal differs from run to run. The rooms move around, the enemies swap places, and the tools that help you defeat your foes constantly change up. Granted, the Underworld isn’t entirely procedurally generated, but the game juggles things just enough that you’ll still need to perfect your own skills if you hope to survive. And don’t be too surprised if you end up dead — that’s just the nature of this beast, and Hades isn’t easy. And that’s totally okay! You see, the more you die, the more opportunities you’ll have to learn about the characters that populate this brilliantly colorful world. Even when you lose, you win!Although the artwork will no doubt dazzle your senses, the writing is where the game truly comes to life. Hades tells a wonderfully witty and warm story, and I found myself wanting to learn more about everything. Roguelites rarely tell interesting stories, let alone ones of this magnitude. As mentioned, when you die, you’ll return home, where you can converse with your friends about your quest and discuss other important matters. You really don’t have to talk to these people, but if you want to dig deeper into the story Hades has to tell, you’ll take a breather between runs and chat up these intriguing characters. Spending gems to upgrade your surroundings will unlock more conversations and encounters, though you’ll also want to splurge on a few things that will make your runs a bit easier. Also, pet the three-headed dog, okay? Tell Cerebus he’s a good boy and give him a few scratches behind the ear. Please, pet the damn dog!For the record, I clocked a lot of hours during the game’s days as an Early Access title on Steam, and I intend to spend a lot more time with Hades on the Nintendo Switch. What’s amazing is that Hades runs exceptionally well in handheld mode on Nintendo’s portable console. While other developers struggle to get their games to work properly on the Switch, Supergiant has clearly spent a lot of time optimizing this title so that it loses absolutely nothing in translation to the smaller screen. Granted, it’s not as sharp or as fast as its PC counterpart, but Hades is no slouch on Switch. So, don’t feel you’re compromising if you decide to play it on the handheld.Straight up: As of this moment, Hades is Game of the Year for me, and I doubt that’s going to change before 2020 finally comes to a close. This is truly video game perfection: It sports great gameplay, a robust amount of content stunning artwork, a wonderful narrative, and a main character you love. You want to see Zagreus succeed in his mission to escape the Underworld, and you’ll spend a lot of time making that happen. And when you’ve finally defeated the final boss, you’ll have plenty of reasons to keep going for hours during the end game. Hades is the complete package, and if you only have a few bucks to spend this year, set aside some room in your budget for this one.This review is based on the Nintendo Switch version. A review code was provided by Supergiant Games.Hades is not only one of the best roguelites on the market today, but it's also one of the best games of the year -- if not the best. Supergiant Games, firing on all cylinders, has given us a wealth of content to explore, characters to meet, and challenges to overcome. If you're not a fan of roguelites, this one could easily change your mind. "

Home » Reviews » Hades Review – You Can’t Tell Me What To Do, DadThe roguelite genre isn’t particularly known for deep storytelling or a strong focus on narrative. Roguelite games are often just a cycle of life and death, repeating dungeon runs with different weapons and abilities as you try to get to the end of the game, and having to start all the way from the beginning each time you die. Sometimes you get permanent unlocks that carry over to your next run, most times you just start over with nothing. Rinse and repeat.Hades is a new action roguelite game from Supergiant Games, a studio with a penchant for storytelling and compelling characters and narratives. And turns out if you mix the studio’s narrative talent with a genre that doesn’t always lend itself well to compelling storytelling, you get Hades: a game that’s somehow surpassed all expectations of what a roguelite could be, and pushes the genre forward in a meaningful manner.Just in case the name didn’t already give it away, Hades’ world is steeped in Greek mythology. You play as Zagreus, the wry prince of the Underworld, son of Hades. He’s tired of living under his father’s oppressive rule, and he seeks to escape the Underworld to reach the surface and see what else awaits him out there.Naturally, his father and his minions aren’t too happy about this, and they’ll stop at nothing to kill Zagreus and send him flying back to the game’s starting point. Thankfully, though, Zagreus’ got other relatives who are more than happy to lend him bits of their power to make his journey to the surface a little easier, and this is where the roguelite elements come into play.From Athena to Zeus, there are tons of gods and familiar faces from Greek mythology available to lend you their aid. Artemis the hunter specializes in dealing critical damage, while Dionysus, the god of pleasure and hedonism adds a Hangover effect to your attacks. And yeah, Hangover causes your enemies to become dazed and confused for a few seconds, giving you an opening to knock ’em dead before they sober up.The gods are all just oozing with personality, too. Dionysus, in particular, is a personal favorite of mine. His artwork and voice work are just perfection; he’s a gorgeous, long-haired Adonis with a wine glass in one hand, a lazy glint in his eyes, and he casually laughs at you while talking about how much fun he’s having partying up on the surface.Look, getting random Boons and abilities to enhance your abilities in a roguelite game was already fun enough, but Hades just adds so much flavor to that simple act of getting a Boon and makes the whole process even more enjoyable. While the game does only feature six weapons at the time of writing, the various Boons more than make up for that and help to add a lot of variety to the gameplay.You can enhance your regular and special attacks with a chain lightning effect from Zeus, and enhance your dash with a deflection effect, or your Cast ability with a slow-moving Blade Rift that decimates everything in its path. Then there are the Duo Boons, which are rare, powered up abilities that you have a chance of getting after unlocking a certain combination of Boons from two different gods.And then there are the Keepsakes, the companions, the Weapon Aspects… you get the idea. Despite my initial disappointment with the low number of weapons, I quickly got over that when I realized just how many different unique build combinations you could get with all of the different variables and skills available in Hades.Once you beat the game for the first time, subsequent runs can be made even tougher with debuffs for Zagreus in exchange for greater rewards. There are weapon upgrades to unlock, NPCs to romance (we’ll get to that in a bit), more items and abilities to grind for, and lore to uncover.In fact, the only drawback to Hades as a roguelite game is that there’s definitely a lack of variety in the chambers that you go through. Every room kinda feels samey after a while, and while the different biomes all have their own gimmicks and distinct themes, the rooms themselves in each area all kinda blend together. I can’t help but draw a quick comparison to Dead Cells, the other fantastic action roguelite game that’s also on Switch, which thrived by giving you a choice of which biome you wanted to try your luck in as you progressed.Biome progression in Hades is linear, and while that’s not necessarily a bad thing in and of itself, your runs do start to feel a bit too familiar after a few hours with the game. But then again, not to spoil any of the surprises that Hades has in store for you, the game always manages to keep things feeling a little fresh by introducing surprise encounters and little changes in familiar areas to keep you on your toes.Where the game really shines is in its story and ability to make you not feel like total crap when you inevitably die and are forced to start from the beginning. In Hades, you’re rewarded with more story content when you die. Each time you return to the House of Hades, you get to speak with the various NPCs just hanging around there and they’ll usually have something to say about your most recent death, and offer you a snarky remark or two. You can also talk to your dad, get berated by him, and hear Zagreus chirp back with a lightly rebellious tinge in his voice.Zag’s chemistry with all of these characters is just great. As you do more runs, you can pick up jars of Nectar, which can then be presented to NPCs as gifts to improve your relationship with them and receive helpful Keepsakes in return, which are items that give you permanent bonuses and benefits during a run. Getting closer to a character has various benefits, including learning more about their backstory and potentially romancing them towards the end of a game.I never knew I needed romantic dating sim elements in my roguelites until I played Hades, and now I can’t get enough of them. I thoroughly enjoyed watching Zag and the tsundere Megaera be totally cold and awkward with each other, but slowly warm up as Meg begins to let her guard down. The interactions between characters are always a joy to watch, thanks in no small part to the truly wonderful and immersive voice work by the cast.Whenever I wasn’t playing Hades, I was thinking about playing more Hades. This game has so much charisma that you can’t help but go back for more, and even when you die, you don’t mind it that much since you know you’ll be rewarded with more precious character dialogue and story progression. Hades feels like a small, but masterful step forward for the roguelite genre as a whole. Maybe there really is no escape from the Underworld, but that’s just fine by me; this is a cycle I don’t want to end.Review BlockGreatCopyright © 2022 GAMURS Group
