Link Official site (opens in new tab)Arkane Studios is calling me out. It knows how I played Dishonored 2—my habit of quickloading away any mistake in pursuit of a perfect stealth playthrough. And given that almost 30% of Steam players have the Ghostly achievement for finishing a mission without ever being spotted, I suspect I'm not alone. Despite having a suite of tools for dealing with messy situations, we ignored them in favour of the most OP button on our keyboard: F9. With Deathloop, Arkane is removing the crutch. Quicksave is gone.Deathloop is all about what happens when things don't go to plan; about panic and improvisation; about learning from a mistake, and taking those lessons forward. Trapped in a time loop, it doesn't matter if you botch your way through combat encounter after combat encounter—it doesn't even matter if you die and get kicked back to the beginning of the day. All that matters is that, in doing so, you gained some information that will help you the next time around.Information is your primary objective in Deathloop—it's how you find and kill the Visionaries that act as the bosses of the island. There are eight in total, and your job as the amnesiac Colt Vahn is to take them all out in a single day in order to break the loop. Your problem is that your day is split into four chunks—morning, noon, afternoon and evening—and you can only visit one of the island's four areas during each period. The Visionaries only appear in certain locations at certain times of the day, and at first it doesn't seem possible to kill them all before the loop resets and your work is undone.As you dig into the lives of your hit list, though, you'll uncover new ways to manipulate them. This is the bulk of the game, and your progress is tracked and updated as each new lead is uncovered. Colt is one of only two people whose memory remains intact when the day loops, which means his targets' behaviour remains consistent, and thus repeatable. It's immensely satisfying as the pieces start falling into place—as you see the consequences of your actions, and start filling out your itinerary in preparation for that perfect day.The process of gathering information doesn't just apply to your primary objective, either. It turns out that looping repetition leads to a more organic sense of discovery that suits the immersive sim genre well. Arkane's level design is filled with secrets—hidden routes and locked doors that hint at new approaches. In Dishonored, you were rewarded for patience and observation, for scouring through notes and diaries and searching in hidden corners. And you can do that in Deathloop, sure, but it also supports a more direct approach.My first visit to Aleksis's party in the Updaam district of Blackreef was an embarrassing disaster. It's the most dangerous area in the game—all of the guests are packing heat—and so my botched stealth attempt became a protracted hunt, as I desperately attempted to run and hide, only to be caught anew. In the end I prevailed, but only after killing every single person in the building. With that done, though, an opportunity presented itself. I was free to explore in peace; to work backwards from inside the building, digging out its quieter areas, and discovering the routes that linked them. When I returned the next day, I was prepared. It still descended into chaos in the end, but did so on my own terms.So far in this review, I've taken the stance that stealth is success, combat is failure. And I do think it's fair to call Deathloop a stealth game first-and-foremost. You hear it in the discordant audio cue that plays when you're spotted, and see it in the exclamation marks that appear over nearby Eternalists—Deathloop's name for the rank and file revellers that will attack you on sight. The game's DNA is so heavily entwined with Dishonored—from its powers, to its art style, to the very function of its UI—that I naturally gravitated towards stealth as my de facto approach.Deathloop wants you to be pressured into slipping up; to cause a situation that you're forced to react to.But even with that mindset, it's clear that Deathloop wants to nudge you away from obsessing over a flawless run. When you take out an Eternalist, they instantly fade into a sort of swirling ethereal mist that others can detect and react to. That means you can't spend hours neatly clearing out the map, hiding each body so that your handiwork is never detected. Deathloop wants you to be pressured into slipping up; to cause a situation that you're forced to react to. And then, when you do, it lets its weapons and powers feel fun to use, and, crucially, never punishes you for taking advantage of them.At first, you start each day carrying only the basic weapons Colt has on him when he wakes up. Pretty early, though, you unlock the ability to infuse items—letting you carry them between loops. This is done by spending residuum, a resource harvested during missions or earned by sacrificing other, unwanted bits of gear. Infusion lets you permanently unlock better equipment for use. The best, of course, is held by the Visionaries themselves, who carry high-tier guns, trinkets and a signature slab—a power in the mould of Dishonored's supernatural abilities.You're restricted in the number of weapons and slabs you can take on a mission, so if you see something you want in the field, you'll have to swap it with something you're already carrying. Dropped weapons and slabs are, logically enough, unavailable for the rest of the day. But thanks to the properties of infusion they'll be waiting for you at the start of the next loop.Another early power lets you respawn twice on the map without dying and thus resetting your loop. This means you can shrug off the occassional stupid mistake or botched encounter. If you can successfully return to your body without dying again, you can retrieve the residuum off your corpse and carry on as normal. At every stage, the game is telling you not to worry. Enjoy yourself. Don't sweat the mistakes.You see, Arkane Studios is also calling out Arkane Studios; in particular Dishonored's central tension of giving the player a suite of tools for murder and mayhem, but using the story to admonish you for using them. There's no such thing as a non-lethal playthrough of Deathloop. Your basic stealth weapons are a machete and a nail gun. Colt's idea of a silent takedown is snapping an Eternalist's neck.You should be able to hit smooth framerates at 1080p at reasonable settings on reasonable hardware. Even on a GeForce 1650 Super, you're looking at an average 43fps at the Ultra preset. This is a shooter mind, so dropping down to the Medium preset will net you a slicker 60fps.

It's a similar story at 1440p on more capable hardware: Deathloop looks good and runs well. Push the resolution up to 4K though, and it isn't quite as flawless. On a GeForce RTX 3080 you're only looking at 53fps using the Ultra settings. The good news is there are plenty of settings to play with to make sure you get the most out of your hardware.It made sense for Dishonored to condemn killing—its story would have been worse if it didn't—but Deathloop's entire structure is built around the idea that everyone you murder will wake up none the wiser when the loop resets. So hey, here's an SMG with an intrinsic perk that recovers your health when you damage an enemy. Try pairing it with the Havoc slab, which makes you tougher and deadlier while it's active.You can tell that Wolfenstein's MachineGames played a role in Deathloop's development. The guns are chunky, powerful and cacophonously loud. That said, the increased focus on violence and combat does accentuate some weaknesses in the AI. It can be easy to cheese combat encounters if you're of a mind to, using corners or doors to funnel enemies into a killzone. But between the guns, the tools, the more combat-focused slabs and the free respawns, it just feels more exciting to embrace the chaos and wade into the mess.It's liberating to revel in destruction, and Colt clearly isn't the only one who feels this way. Throughout you'll find Eternalists enjoying the lack of consequences, vandalising the island and performing idiotic stunts over the course of the day. If death doesn't matter, why not shoot yourself out of a cannon?Throughout the game, there's a voice telling you that, actually, you love this. That's not me making some grand point about the duality of man or something: there's literally a voice—one coming from the other end of your radio each time you step into a new level. It belongs to Julianna, the other person on the island whose memory persists through each day. Her job is to protect the loop by hunting and killing Colt. And it's a task she revels in.This cat-and-mouse relationship is the heart of Deathloop's story, and enhances the mystery of the loop, the island and Colt's past. As antagonistic as their conversations are, it's also clear Julianna enjoys their game. At one point she clarifies to Colt that she doesn't love watching him die, she simply loves killing him. There's a playfulness to her goading, but also an underlying frustration that makes uncovering the past that Colt can't remember all the more intriguing.Julianna's hunts are also the final piece of Deathloop's systemic puzzle, the thing that ties its various riffs on the immersive sim genre together. She can invade any level that contains a Visionary, and—if you play with online enabled, at least—will be controlled by another player. With an entire level as your playground, this leads to some incredibly tense encounters, but also plenty of slapstick shenanigans. Once, a player invaded me but didn't realise I'd already hacked some of the nearby turrets. They spawned, I heard a turret start to fire, and moments later the game told me Julianna had been killed.Colt is more heavily favoured in these encounters, because Julianna can't respawn when killed. Ultimately that imbalance is for the best. For Colt, the stakes are higher. Dying during the loop means losing access to any weapons or upgrades he gathered during that level—as well as any picked up earlier in the day that haven't yet been infused. As Julianna, meanwhile, your progression is tied to feats performed during your hunts. Even if you don't end Colt's day, a decent performance will still net you points towards unlocking more weapons, powers and upgrades.Julianna's hunts are also the final piece of Deathloop's systemic puzzle, the thing that ties its various riffs on the immersive sim genre together.Ultimately, most Julianna encounters are resolved in an open firefight, which is the key to why so much of Deathloop is constructed the way it is. Why can I only equip a handful of weapons and powers? Because building a loadout is more interesting if Julianna is a potential threat. Throughout the game, I made heavy use of Shift—Deathloop's version of Dishonored's Blink—and Nexus—Deathloop's version of Dishonored's Domino. Both were invaluable for reaching high-up spots where I could easily and silently take down groups of Eternalists.But as I progressed, I started to favour slabs like Aether, which turns Colt invisible, or Havoc, which makes him tougher and more deadly. These were picks specifically designed to counterplay an invasion. One of Aether's upgrades stops it from draining your power as long as you're standing still. It's the perfect tool for turning hunter into hunted—I've caught more than a few invaders who decided to sprint across a section of the level, not realising I was near.Certain gun perks make more sense with Julianna in mind too. At first I wasn't sure why I'd ever need a version of the Fourpounder—an absolute cannon of a handgun—that creates a gas cloud at the point of impact. It can already dispatch Eternalists with a single headshot—anything more seemed like overkill. But Julianna is tougher, and the damage-over-time causes players to panic. That can lead to funny interactions, like the time an invader shot at me through the flammable gas cloud, blowing themselves up in the process.For the first few hours of Deathloop, I was more interested in it as Arkane's response to Dishonored—a series that I love. I was enjoying myself, and looking forward to uncovering the mysteries of the island, but was more intrigued by what Arkane was saying about the genre as a whole, and about the way people played its previous games. It wasn't until another player invaded my game that it all clicked together, and I started enjoying Deathloop on its own terms.After around 25 hours, I may have completed the story, but I'm still not done: I want to complete the remaining puzzles to see what new weapons and upgrades are out there, and learn how they can help my fight against Julianna in the future. And I want to see how the hidden routes I discovered as Colt can help me be a better invader against other players less familiar with the levels. Colt might be determined to break the loop, but—at least for now—I'm not in any rush.A thoughtful response to Dishonored that makes for an entertaining stealth shooter in its own right, but it's the multiplayer invasions that make Deathloop sing.Phil has been writing for PC Gamer for nearly a decade, starting out as a freelance writer covering everything from free games to MMOs.

Deathloop,Edwin Evans-Thirlwell,Eurogamer,https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-09-12-deathloop-review,"All-rounder.Following a year of console exclusivity to the PlayStation 5, Arkane's outstanding Deathloop arrives on Xbox Series S/X today and it'll be hitting Game Pass to boot. There are some minor tweaks and changes, including all the accessibility options added over the last year as well as a new extended ending, but beyond that it's the same brilliant game, so here's our review of the original, first published in September 2021, to let you know a little more. Deathloop is about killing the people who are killing time. Set in an alternate 1970s that feels more like the far future of Dishonored's Gristol than part of Earth's history, it's a freeform, first-person mix of shooting, assassination, hacking and sorcery in which you wind and rewind a single day both to experiment with tools and manipulate targets such that you can massacre them all before darkness falls. The lead is Colt Vahn, a hulking amnesiac who - shortly after being hacked to death by a mysterious woman - wakes on a time-locked Arctic island overrun by a hedonistic Bond movie organisation called AEON. To undo the rippling Anomaly keeping the island's never-ending murder-party in motion, Colt must slay the eight ""Visionaries"" who preside over four, separately loading areas, which also involves digging into the island's buried secrets, slaughtering no end of rank-and-file ""Eternalists"", and unravelling the riddle of his own presence. Amongst the Visionaries is Julianna, the aforesaid mystery lady, incorrigible nuisance-caller and the game's second playable character, who stars in a multiplayer mode where you invade the worlds of other Colts and kill them for unlocks. What follows is a stylish, bloodthirsty and considerate reworking of ideas from Arkane's other games, which clears away a little of Dishonored's haughty perfectionism and grants you ample leeway to run amok. This is captured by the art direction, which retains Dishonored's brooding, salt-soaked shorelines but covers them with neon signboards, boutique low-poly statues and jaunty Space Age cabins - an upper cruster's carnival with heady overtones of Tarantino and Wolfenstein, perched atop the ruins of a much less forgiving game. I'm not sure it's Arkane's most adventurous or surprising work - for all the louder presentation, it sometimes pulls its punches. But it might be Arkane's most straightforwardly enjoyable game. To begin with, Deathloop just feels like Dishonored with guns and gadgets pilfered from Q's workshop. Among the first tools the bleary-eyed Colt gets his hands on are a wireless hackamajig for use against security sensors and automated turrets, and a fancy bomb that can be morphed into a tripwire, a landmine or a grenade. You could play through the entire game with just these devices, mining chokepoints and creatively rearranging the defences. But you'll have much more fun if you make use of Slabs, magical abilities plucked from the cooling bodies of the Visionaries. Shift is Deathloop's version of Blink, the short-ranged teleport that propelled Arkane to stardom back in 2012. It's still an absolute showstopper, elegantly abbreviating the process of creeping and flanking, and providing easy access to the island's many rooftops, towers and subterranean facilities. As superpowers go, it's rivalled only by Nexus, aka Dishonored 2's Domino, which links adversaries such that what happens to one happens to all. Unlike with Domino there's no hard limit on the number of Nexus connections, allowing you to silence a heaving dancefloor with a single bullet. Or you could launch all those dancers into the ceiling with Karnesis, the Deathloop spin on Dishonored's Pull ability. Pairing mods sparks any number of possibilities: you could deploy Shift with Aether, aka near-invisibility, to become a perfect ghost, or Karnesis with Havoc, aka berserker mode, to become Darth Vader storming hallways singlehanded. The guns, meanwhile, come in familiar shades but are a treat to wield, thanks not least to some nuanced rumble feedback. Arkane Lyon co-developed Wolfenstein: Youngblood, and you can see that experience in the gleam and heft of Deathloop's firearms, which range from thundering handcannons and pneumatic nailguns to drum-fed shotguns that look like weaponised carousel projectors.Probably Deathloop's biggest disappointment is that all the Slabs have precedents in Dishonored. You could also argue that it doesn't steal enough: some of the Outsider's weirder gifts have been left on the table, like conjuring up spectral assassins or transforming yourself into rats and fish. But what Deathloop lacks in terms of individual tools, it makes up for in terms of freedom to use them. Your power bar recharges, for starters, so you can wield all those intoxicating skills without scraping around for elixirs. You also have more license to screw up thanks to Colt's Reprise slab, a Tracer-style rewinding skill which essentially gives you three stabs at each level before the entire day resets. These tweaks are the mark of a gentler, more playful game, structured to reward improvisation and investigation rather than lock you into the story, which is here conveyed more through backstory documents and charismatically written dialogue than cutscenes. It's not so much an improvement on Arkane's other sims as a change of tune. The Dishonored games insist on a suspenseful friction between breadth of options and severity of consequences: yes, you can dream up killing methods beyond the designers' wildest nightmares, but the soul of a city hangs on your conduct, and while you can replay levels in search of more elegant or inventive solutions, you can't (pre-patching, anyway) fire up any level and mess around as you please. Deathloop, by contrast, is a devil-may-care holiday album of places, periods and layouts that only synchs up into a linear campaign when you want it to. In theory you're at the mercy of the clock, but the time of day only advances when you move between areas, and if you're in a rush, you can always hit fast-forward in the mission lobby. Deathloop's setting doesn't reset completely between deaths. Certain key developments persist. The first is Colt's expanding memory of events, with things like mission objectives and passwords conveniently preserved on your inventory screen (there's an autofill option when using keypads, a vital shortcut in a game with dozens of codes to learn). Once you've killed a particular Visionary and harvested their research, you can also retain weapons, Slabs and trinkets - aka smaller upgrades such as faster aiming or exploding projectiles - between runs by infusing them with ""Residium"" energy gathered from objects in the world. These objects are plentiful, and you can always obtain Residium by recycling items between forays, so amassing an arsenal is much easier than in the average roguelike. I almost never found myself visiting areas simply to scrounge for guns and materials.Slab mods, meanwhile, are obtained by killing the Slab's owner over and over - a brilliant incentive to revisit times and places and improvise afresh using powers and insight gained from the previous murder. It does away with the tedium of XP grinding, while simultaneously spotlighting the DIY ethos for which Arkane is famous. The mods themselves again recall Dishonored, but that doesn't make them any less entertaining. Employ the Shift Slab's self-explanatory Swapper mod to leave a trail of disoriented people in your wake, moving them into the paths of their own grenades, or leaving them to screech confusedly on windowsills. Or you can mod Nexus such that the effect spreads between characters as they pass each other - as stern a lesson on the importance of social distancing as any.There are two halves to Deathloop's story. In the first, you kill the Visionaries one by one and obtain their powers, infiltrating and mastering the eccentricities of lairs that range from Punchdrunk-style live action shooting courses to sprawling castle masquerades. In the second, you exploit your foreknowledge of events and access to hidden locations to bring everybody together, perhaps messing up one Visionary's morning so that they decide to come along to the evening gala. The game's lore and mission menus are startlingly intuitive, given the complexity of all this - there's a daisy chain of clues and leads you can ponder, but all you really need are the brief directions you're given when you select an area.The Visionaries and Eternalists themselves are an army of clown-painted mayflies who can be slaughtered over and over without penalty and remorse. They're also a bunch of extremely inebriated people with minimal training, which helps explain away AI shortcomings like everybody charging heedlessly into your sights, and leads to some amusing combat chatter. ""Hey, it's that one guy!"" one woman slurs a second before you land on her machete first. ""Fine, I guess I'll cover myself then,"" complains one man to his shredded brethren as you circle round his position. It's often worth stopping to watch the Eternalists go about their business, whether they're getting loaded in the bars or taking advantage of their ""amortality"" to kill each other for kicks. While exploring one roof in Updaan, the island's social hub, I stumbled on a woman industriously setting up a line of cereal boxes so as to drop a landmine on somebody's head. Like Hitman - whose influence is also traceable in the modular campaign structure and certain setpiece environment kills - Deathloop's writing and characterisation take square aim at what The Great Gatsby called the ""vast carelessness"" of the super-rich. The Visionaries range from elite scientists to ogreish rockstars and pampered artistes. They resemble classic Bond villains at first, but the dialogue channels that more contemporary blend of sociopathy that sees billionaires trying to reboot humanity on Mars while claiming that we all live in the Matrix. While Deathloop stands out among blockbuster shooters for featuring two Black leads, the social divisions it explores are less about race or for that matter gender or sexual orientation, more about the reality-altering force of hideous quantities of cash. The Visionaries are a diverse bunch, but at the end of the day, they are all one and the same concentration of impossible wealth.For all this, it's possible to view your targets with a certain pity. AEON's disciples might think they've shucked off mortality, but their refuge is a purgatory that's all foreplay without release. One thing you learn early is that only a tiny handful, including Colt and Julianna, retain any awareness of the fact that they've been reliving their ""First Day"" for a while. The majority are caught on the threshold of immortality. They will never know anything beyond anticipation (and hangovers, in many cases - if you're entering a time-loop, it's best not to party too hard the night before). There are scientists who will never build on their breakthroughs, and creatives who will never finish their masterworks. There are characters who are caught forever in abusive relationships, and randos doomed to perform one and the same odd-job for eternity. Julianna and one other individual aside, the only person in a position to actually enjoy the timeloop is Colt. So why, as she continually asks you over the radio, are you in such a hurry to leave? I'd have liked Deathloop to take a few more cues from Hitman. There are hints of social stealth - the suggestion that you can obtain a disguise to access that evening party incognito, for example - but it doesn't bloom into a full-on mingle 'em up. The Eternalists always know you're coming, which means that they always behave like guards rather than civilians, and as Julianna warns you early on, everybody recognises Colt's trademark leather jacket. It feels like a slight missed opportunity. Given that this is an online game, I'd also have liked to see something like Hitman's Contracts mode, which let you assign a target and killing method for other players to master. ""This might be Arkane's most straightforwardly enjoyable game yet.""In place of that you get Julianna's side of the game, which recalls Assassin's Creed's long-forgotten PvP multiplayer. Where Colt has his rewind ability, Julianna's Slab lets her swap faces and outfits with any NPC, leaving a clone of herself strolling around while she play-acts as cannon fodder. In practice, I've found that a lot of Juliannas just run towards the loudest noise firing a shotgun, but given an appropriately methodical opponent, Deathloop sings as a cat-and-mouse game. Julianna seals all the map's exits when she invades, obliging Colt to hack a radio tower to escape. As the invader, the obvious approach is to surround the tower with tripwires and landmines, but you might also sic the Eternalist mob on Colt with the D-pad, or lay ambushes along the obvious routes to make your opponent's map knowledge a disadvantage. If all this sounds like a chore, you can always turn off the online, though this means that you'll only get to fight an AI-controlled Julianna once in the game. There's also a limit to how often any given Julianna player can invade you to stop high-level griefers ruining the experience for greener Colts.Appropriately for a game about time travel, Deathloop can be read as a game both for newcomers and old hands - an accessible introduction to Arkane's grittier immersive sims, or a triumphant refinement of the Dishonored style. Where it feels most like a concluding act is in how it builds on a theme in Arkane's work about games as means of both coercion and liberation, trapping you in order to empower and motivate you to break out of them, forever challenging you to think of some possibility that has escaped the developer's calculations, to the point of sabotaging the illusion entirely. I've argued in the past that this contradiction is fundamental to the immersive sim genre, but Arkane is unique in making it a question of story and setting. We see this in the opening and closing moments of 2017's Prey, in Dishonored 2's Clockwork Mansion and in the studio's penchant for villains who are domineering game designers in all but name. And we see it in Deathloop, which takes that curious inside/outside thinking and applies it to Time itself.

You have no choice but to pick at the occasional loose thread because there is so little to criticise about the larger tapestry. Given that I've opened up this review by talking about Blackreef's bathrooms, you can probably see where I'm going with this already: While Deathloop may share some common design ethos with Dishonored and Prey, it's a fundamentally different experience. Arkane establishes this early, with the first locked door you encounter. I do it almost on instinct, punching 0451 into the keypad and expecting it to swing open. Instead, I'm met with a blinking red light as Captain Colt Vahn growls something about 'old habits dying hard' – a PlayStation Trophy pops, a consolation prize for the infamous immersive sim cheat code not working on Blackreef either. I'll promise you this, you've never played an Arkane game quite like Deathloop before. Release Date: September 14, 2021
Platform(s): PS5, PC
Developer: Arkane Studios
Publisher: BethesdaArkane sets its worlds apart by targeting coherence. Dunwall and Karnaca were high-concept, heavily industrialized cities peering off the edge of the world, but they felt lived-in – as if they were real places that Corvo Attano and Emily Kaldwin were actively disrupting. While working to secure Talos I, it seemed as if Morgan Yu really was rooting through a space station suspended in the past, a scientific experiment gone awry recounted one room at a time. Arkane didn't build these intricate environments just to impress, it did so to tell a layered narrative, and to immerse you in a specific place and time. Every object in an Arkane world is there for a reason. It's this characteristic of coherence that helped make Dishonored and Prey special.It's exciting then to see the studio try something different with Deathloop. Blackreef might be Arkane's most artificial world yet. Your main point of interaction with its patchwork of spaces is through the barrels of some beautifully rendered weaponry. What we have in Blackreef is four creative, finely-crafted sets  – each dressed to be seen during four periods of a single day – that are both self-contained and persistently tracking progress in what will at times feel like an impossible task: to assassinate eight targets in a single day, or die trying. And you're going to die. Truth be told, you're going to die a lot. And I promise that you're going to enjoy it. You'll be shot, stabbed, and sent tumbling down cliff faces, splashing into the frigid waters that surround this island suspended in time. You'll choke, drown, be set on fire, and ground up into meat paste as you stalk rooftops in the morning, noon, afternoon, and night. As a reward for exploring enough to uncover a path less travelled, maybe you'll accidentally trap yourself in a depressurization chamber, or have your molecules obliterated by an unstable reactor. Death isn't to be feared in Deathloop, but embraced. Dying is an opportunity to learn something new. About the layout of Blackreef's four districts, the eight Visionaries that must be assassinated, and the hordes of Eternalists that are hell bent on preventing it all from crashing down around them. Deathloop is less concerned about delivering a coherent lived-in world, with Arkane focusing its energy instead on building something that is consistent. That is key, because consistency allows you to internalize enemy placements and begin to use them to your advantage. Gradually, you'll discover how to retain your favorite weapons and awesome supernatural powers, even after dying. You'll work out where the Visionaries reside, the fastest routes to confront them, and, eventually, ways to encourage multiple targets to reside in a single location. The steady acquisition of knowledge is a more powerful weapon than any gun or power in Deathloop.And it's all a lot of fun. When I said before that Blackreef felt artificial, that isn't necessarily a criticism. Deathloop has a different agenda to Dishonored and Prey. Blackreef is less a playground and more of a smartly-designed hedge maze; there's only one exit and, every time that you die, you're put back at the entrance; the story it wants to convey is one of escape and everything you do is in service of that. What Arkane has built here in Deathloop is a multifaceted puzzle box. Blackreef doesn't feel fleshed out in the way Dunwall and Karnaca did. No matter how much reading of discarded notes you do, you won't get a real sense of why hundreds of masked Eternalists flocked to the island to escape the passage of time, why the Visionaries invested so much of themselves in preserving the loop, or how any of them live their lives in Deathloop's four dreamy technicolor districts. The people of Blackreef exist to die. To be whipped out of windows with telekinesis. To have their necks snapped over, and over, and over again. To stand rooted in place as you storm toward them with an SMG that heals you gripped in one hand and a hand-cannon that fires explosive rounds in the other. Deathloop doesn't excel as an out-and-out shooter, its turning circle and aim assist can feel sluggish in a way that Wolfenstein doesn't, for example – a series the studio has collaborated with MachineGames on in the past. But it sure is a hell of a good time to shoot a lot of people all the same.  Deathloop isn't the first game to attempt a puzzle box in this new generation. IO Interactive's Hitman 3 arrived earlier this year and the difference between the two couldn't be more stark – both in terms of their visual aesthetic and style of play they encourage. If anything, the experience of playing Deathloop is the inverse of how you're traditionally pushed through something like a Hitman 3. IO designed a complexity curve that is narrow to begin with and gradually widens as you familiarise yourself with its overlapping systems, mechanics, and layouts. Its 'mission stories' can help even the most confused killers execute the most spectacular assassinations, steering players with waypoints and contextual clues through every step of the process. As you become more comfortable, IO gradually takes its hands off of your shoulders, leaving you to your own devices inside some truly stunning sandboxes. Deathloop does the opposite. Arkane uses the opening hours to outline the big concept. To point to where each of the Visionaries initially reside and to teach you the basics of death, respawning, equipping weapons, and altering their utility with supernatural Trinkets. And then Arkane walks away, throwing you into Blackreef to be guided by little more than the occasional mission marker and your inherent desire to experiment. The first 15 hours of Deathloop are among its most entertaining, as you push against the world just to see how hard it will shove you back. ""The experience of playing Deathloop is the inverse of how you're traditionally pushed through something like a Hitman 3""Eventually, Deathloop begins to contort. As you begin taking Visionaries down, collecting their unique weapons and Slabs – supernatural abilities, not bestowed upon you by An Outsider, but made by a few dozen annoying scientists in a laboratory – and discovering key information on how to break the cycle, the complexity curve begins to narrow and the scope of play with it. There's only one way to set the dominos and only one way to have them fall. Once you work out an element that's critical to breaking the loop, Deathloop celebrates it with an animated cutscene just to punctuate the point: you may have nothing but time, but it's time to stop wasting it.In a sense then, Deathloop gets more linear as time goes on, until you're essentially speedrunning toward a cycle of murder that can topple all eight of the Visionaries. You stop utilizing non-essential locked passageways, hidden hideaways, and the verticality of the maps, as you may have done in the early hours, and begin to focus your attention on efficiency. Deathloop ceases to hint at new opportunities and starts offering solutions outright, with mission markers and menu indicators working to keep you on track. It's a fascinating twist, one that keeps Deathloop feeling fresh and focused all throughout its generous runtime. If I were to give you any advice, it would be not to rush toward the final objective; taking time to explore, discovering ways to streamline your runs through each area and time zone, is a good time worth savoring. The longer you can hold off on assembling the pieces of the puzzle, the better a time you'll have with Deathloop. Even with Deathloop's focus narrowing over time, there is one element of randomization that will have a minor impact on your runs and that's Julianna – a small inconsistency in a game otherwise defined by its predictable patterns. Whether the rival assassin is controlled by AI or by another real player – whereby somebody across the world boots up Deathloop, chooses violence, and decides to invade your game from the menu – it's a nice touch that can very quickly increase the tension in your fingers, something the Eternalists and Visionaries eventually lose the ability to do. Listen, once you're able to clear all of Fristad Rock with little more than a pressurized nail gun and an intimate knowledge of both enemy and trap placement, Deathloop's pervading sense of challenge can begin to dissipate. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Deathloop. It wasn't what I thought it was going to be and it seemed to challenge my expectations without reservation. It's a murder mystery that's suspended in a time loop. It's a first-person shooter that features a shotgun that can transform into a rifle. It's a sci-fi spy adventure that's stuck in the '70s. It's all of these things and none of them at all. My impression of Deathloop seemed to shift with every passing hour and, as a result, it's difficult to not be impressed – if not thoroughly enthralled – with what Arkane has pieced together here. It's different, it's stylish, it's new. You won't play anything else quite like Deathloop for a very long time.Deathloop was reviewed on PS5 with code provided by the publisher. Josh West is the UK Managing Editor of GamesRadar+.

Deathloop,Blake Hester,Game Informer,https://www.gameinformer.com/review/deathloop/deathloop-review-the-joys-of-death-and-dying,"Deathloop is a paradox, where time is in both infinite supply and quickly running out. Protagonist Colt Vahn is stuck in a timeloop, desperately trying his best to get off the gleefully nihilistic island of Blackreef. The rules of breaking the timeloop seem simple: kill eight targets within 24 hours. Paradoxically, this feat is an intricate clockwork of planning, preparation, and execution that feels impossible at first. It all culminates in one of Arkane Studios' best games to date.Deathloop begins in media res, as Colt is murdered by a mysterious woman named Julianna Blake. As soon as he dies, he wakes up on a strange beach with no knowledge of who he is or how he got there. Julianna soon makes contact, explaining his situation, and by extension, the game's rules. Colt is on Blackreef, where time is perpetually stuck, and murder is the only way out.The game revels in its nihilistic world; dying has no meaning on Blackreef, so why not do whatever you want? Death, murder, and all manner of awful things are treated casually, lending dark humor to the whole experience. This kind of storytelling could have become juvenile in the wrong hands, but Deathloop's writing is strong, and I enjoyed seeing the twisted ways it played with the timeloop conceit. Colt and Julianna's interactions – full of bickering and arguments – are almost always entertaining and humorous, and the two are now among my favorite video game characters of the year.Blackreef is broken into four large districts, each with its own clues on how to proceed, access to targets, and storylines that progress the main plot or serve as side content. Each district has a unique flair – from a city center hosting a massive party to an expansive research station near the coast – and arriving at different times of day changes everything from where guards patrol to who and what is available. You can choose to explore a district at four times of day: morning, noon, afternoon, or evening, and I enjoy the way this makes you plan your routes accordingly.Tracking leads throughout Blackreef quickly became my favorite part of Deathloop. I loved exploring, seeing how the world opens up and how my opportunities change over the course of a day. It takes a while to get to the bottom of any mystery in Deathloop, but the game does a good job of paying you back for your time with fun new ways to play, such as access to new powers, better weapons, and upgrades for both.Compared to Arkane's previous immersive sim series, Dishonored, Deathloop encourages players to spill as much blood as they want; no penalty or morality system is punishing you for using all the cool weapons and powers at your disposal. Many of those powers are very similar to those in Dishonored, including teleporting around levels and chaining multiple enemies together so that killing one kills everyone in the chain. From the get-go, these powers seem like upgraded versions of those in Dishonored, meaning Deathloop is effectively one giant power trip. As I honed my skills and memorized its various levels, I loved loading in and ripping through an environment in a matter of minutes – especially when combined with the game's great arsenal, which includes a nail gun for silent headshots and an SMG that can be reloaded while shooting for a non-stop bullet spray. An in-game currency allows weapons, powers, and upgrades to be carried between loops, which is a helpful touch for alleviating the penalties of death.The last trick up Deathloop's sleeve is its online component, which pits players against each other. Where the single player focuses on Colt, players can also jump into a mode where they play as Julianna. The former tries to achieve their objective as the latter invades other players' games and attempts to hunt them down and kill them. This mechanic can be turned off, but I found that these invasions add a fun bit of tension and spontaneity to runs, especially when playing with a friend I could talk and laugh with. My best-laid plans were useless when Julianna showed up, and the dangerous game of cat and mouse that ensued always left me on edge.The further I got, the more satisfying it became putting all the various puzzle pieces together until finally, I had a finished plan. I had built dozens of routes to get through my final day, assembled an arsenal of perfect weapons, and chosen the right powers to kill all my targets. And then I botched it all at the last second. But that ever-building sense of knowledge and accomplishment present throughout the game led me to immediately start a new playthrough, to experiment further and explore. In Deathloop, dying is fun, killing is even better, and I can't wait to see what the game throws at me next.

Deathloop,Tauriq Moosa,Polygon,https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22673773/deathloop-review-ps5-pc-steam-arkane-studios,"Filed under:It’s strange and wondrous, and above all, it treats me with respectOf the many fantasies humanity has entertained, conquering time has been paramount, whether through time machines, freezing, or reversing. If time is the great consumer, then those that control time control the universe. It is no wonder, then, that the villains of Deathloop have decided to seize time for themselves. Arkane Lyon’s latest sandbox adventure deploys a time mechanic like no other game. The studio has created the equivalent of a finely tuned watch. And it’s truly one of the most incredible video game experiences of my life. Polygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences. When we award the Polygon Recommends badge, it’s because we believe the recipient is uniquely thought-provoking, entertaining, inventive, or fun — and worth fitting into your schedule. If you want curated lists of our favorite media, check out What to Play and What to Watch.Deathloop is a first-person time-looping murder/puzzle game where time has become both meaningless and everything. Player character Colt wakes up, with no memory, on the beach of a strange island. The island is experiencing one day on repeat, with everyone — except Colt (and another character) — performing the same actions. Colt wants to break this cycle and escape.The island is controlled by eight rich, murderous assholes called Visionaries. Colt must assassinate all eight before the end of the day to break the loop. The Visionaries are spread out over four distinct sandbox districts and four time periods. Moving from one district to another moves the day forward. However, while Colt is in one district, time stands still. I can take all the time I want to explore — which is essential for the deeply fascinating, complex and carefully crafted level design Arkane is known for. Added to this is Julianna, a young woman determined to taunt and murder and also encourage Colt. Like Colt, she remembers previous loops. And she can appear at almost any time to ruin Colt’s plans. The most important part is that she can be controlled by other players, who can also upgrade her along a completely separate progression path. I was not able to test this out fully, given how few people were playing during the review period (and I also had severe lag while playing on PlayStation 5). But the few moments where it worked were amazing. Playing as, essentially, the villain transforms the entire experience, and it’s a genius bit of design. I look forward to experiencing it fully now that more people are playing.

  The relationship between Colt and Julianna is the heart of this game, and the performances by Jason E. Kelley and Ozioma Akagha, respectively, are astounding. It’s also important to note that both playable characters are Black, which is cause for celebration when there is a dearth of Black people being represented as leads in big-budget media (and in particular, a lack of Black characters who aren’t gang members or criminals). Furthermore, Colt is a bit of a weirdo and a surprising lead: He sometimes bursts into song, he enjoys murdering, and he is terrible at telling jokes. He’s your friend’s weird dad. Even when Julianna is threatening him, he doesn’t have the heart to be mean to her. It’s surprising and delightful that most of Deathloop is intelligence gathering, not assassinating. After all, when there are still four Visionaries left at the end of the day, Colt has not broken the loop. In other words: Deathloop is Edge of Tomorrow meets Hitman. Colt obtains access to multiple upgradeable weapons. While some of these are standard fare — pistols, SMGs, rifles — some legendary variants are notable. My favorite is a pair of pistols that can be stacked together like two giant Lego bricks to form a rifle.As is tradition with Arkane’s games, Colt also has access to otherworldly powers. Shift allows Colt to phase through a large gap instantly (it’s basically the Blink ability from Dishonored); another allows Colt to link multiple enemies such that killing one kills them all (similar to Domino in Dishonored 2). Mixing the powers and weapons often leads to incredible moments. For example, after I located two Visionaries surrounded by their minions, I used my link ability to tie both targets to one isolated guard. Killing him meant I took both down instantly.With hacking tools available and multiple entryways to each building, Deathloop is more than welcoming to stealthier players. But this is the first Arkane game that feels wonderful as an all-out action shooter, too. In fact, an Arkane game has never felt this good. I didn’t feel punished for breaking a stealth approach, and some magic powers even encourage it. Colt can toss people into the air; he can go berserk and become supernaturally strong.

  Part of what makes the game feel so smooth is that the studio also has fully embraced the PS5’s DualSense controller. Every gun feels unique; every power has its own sensation. Colt’s footsteps perfectly sync with the rumble on either side. It’s an incredibly tactile experience. In terms of aesthetics, Deathloop has a quirky, albeit derelict, 1960s spy theme. Think No One Lives Forever, but covered in decay. One district is essentially an amusement park, while another is graced by snow and a giant, pulsating satellite array. None of this is to mention how the locales shift throughout the day: A car that was idle in the morning has crashed through some windows by the afternoon; a ship in open water is reachable later when ice has formed. Despite this being a game about repetition, no interior or exterior location feels recycled.One would expect moving from one level to the next to be seamless on a new-generation console, but unfortunately, the game has to log into its servers each time. It only takes a few seconds, but it’s undoubtedly a blow to the slick momentum elsewhere. Such is the price for an innovative multiplayer mode, I guess.Another issue is the game’s strange reluctance to let me track information properly or on my own. Colt has a murder board, but it only gives me step-by-step tasks, not broad information Colt obviously knows. The pre-mission planning menus are clunky, making it hard to know where specific information is or even if it can be tracked. I found it easier to make my own notes.What’s more, I had imagined the game would require me to plot the eventual perfect murder day (i.e., to kill all the targets before the end of the day). But Deathloop itself puts all the information together and sets out the path. I understand how this might prevent frustration for players who aren’t diligent note takers. But it mitigated my sense of satisfaction after paying attention every step of the way. Deathloop is a strange but wondrous beast. It’s a time-management game where I built a precision murder machine to effect a carefully plotted rampage. It’s also a story about a man finding out who he is and why he’s being hunted by a young woman who knows everything about him. Time is Colt’s prison, yet also the source of his power. But it felt liberating to break free entirely, to have executed such quiet devastation. By the end, I was left in awe at the precision of Deathloop’s focus, the liberty and respect afforded to me as a player, and the minimization — though not complete removal — of frustration in a game entirely centered around repetition. The success with which Arkane pulled this all off is a testament to the studio’s incredible talent and intelligence. No other studio makes you feel quite so smart, and no game of theirs has done it better. Deathloop was released Sept. 14 on Windows PC and PlayStation 5.

   on September 14, 2021 at 7:07AM PDTThe Isle of Blackreef is a place where lawlessness and debauchery aren't just welcomed but encouraged. It's caught in a time loop, so the events of any given day have no bearing on the next. At the end of every sex, drug, and alcohol binge-fueled evening, the slate is wiped clean so it can happen all over again. Memories are lost and harm--self-inflicted or done to others--is always undone. Blackreef changed me. It made me behave in a way that's not in my nature. Whether it's Metal Gear Solid, Deus Ex, Splinter Cell, or Dishonored, the role I inhabit is that of a ghost, entering a scenario to achieve an objective and leaving with clean hands and conscience. I'm the pebble thrown into water that makes no ripples.And yet, in Deathloop, I murdered hundreds of Eternalists and I felt good about doing it. I tried to be true to myself--skulking across rooftops, hiding in dark corners, and carefully moving between people, but the allure of Blackreef's daily absolution was difficult to resist. I watched the first Eternalist I killed dissolve into nothingness, and a message written into the air in some ethereal ink assured me he'd return in the next loop, completely oblivious to what happened. Killing became second nature, and with no consequence why wouldn't it?You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Deathloop Video ReviewThe rules of Deathloop's world created an intoxicating sense of liberation, but this leads to the game's central question of purpose: When nothing matters, how do you give your actions meaning? That is where developer Arkane Lyon's gameplay design comes into play, and killing with reckless abandon becomes killing for a reason: to break the loop. The mechanics that govern the world and facilitate your quest to upend it are constructed so masterfully that there's a tangible sense of growth both in-game and out of it. You begin your first day in Blackreef dazed, confused, and incredibly hungover, and end your final one as the unstoppable architect of its demise.But what's most impressive about Deathloop is that it's also an introspective game. It's Arkane deconstructing its own brand of open-ended action and laying bare all the pieces crucial to it. The systems are presented as digestible on an individual level, but then the game subtly pushes you to put the pieces together so you can truly appreciate how the clockwork world ticks, before bringing a swift fist crashing down on it. Deathloop is a game where observation and dynamic thinking go hand-in-hand with shotgunning goons in the face and snapping their necks; where throwing a grenade into a soiree for sycophants counts as the right kind of experimentation and derring-do. It delivers bombastic thrills and wince-inducing kills with intelligence and elegance in equal measure.At the heart of the game is Colt Vahn, a man simultaneously adrift in time and stuck within it. He wakes up on a beach with no memory of how he got there or what's really going on. However, what distinguishes him from the other hedonistic denizens of Blackreef is that he is able to retain his memories between loops. Dying will force him into a new loop, but the knowledge he has accrued up until his death will return with him. And very soon, he discovers that a strange element called Residuum can be harnessed to give his arsenal of weaponry and supernatural abilities permanence too.Like Arkane Lyon's Dishonored games, Deathloop is a fascinating mashup of styles and vibes, both narratively and aesthetically. Underpinning the world is a kind of retro-future science that, as oxymoronic as it sounds, is incredibly effective at giving the world texture--think time travel by way of 1960s computers that fill a room and look like they have less power than an original iPhone. Complementing that is an element of the supernatural that is essentially time science harnessed by a genius mind to give a chosen few the ability to do things like teleport, link the fates of people together, become almost invisible to the naked eye, or throw objects around an environment with a wave of the hand. These abilities are bestowed to the Visionaries, an eclectic group of elites that the rank and file are sworn to protect so that their life of indulgence can remain eternal. Colt's goal is to kill these Visionaries and, in doing so, break the time loop that keeps him trapped there. The rub is that it needs to be done in one day--a single loop. Easier said than done given that the game operates on a day and night cycle where, over the course of the loop, each Visionary has their own routine and life to lead.Complicating matters further is the fact that the Visionaries know Colt is out to get them and, in fact, all of them have some sort of pre-existing relationship with him. One in particular, Julianna, takes it upon herself to be a thorn in Colt's side. She serves the role of antagonist but the situation is clearly complicated between them. Their interpersonal dynamic is placed front and center to drive much of the narrative and characterization, and both characters are realized exceptionally well.Julianna is the voice in Colt's ear and also over Blackreef's loudspeakers, and she does her damndest to get under his skin. She picks at him in a way that only someone with a deep personal connection to you can, using insight into his personality and history to constantly undermine him and poke at his neuroses. She's always one step ahead, exposing Colt's habits, analyzing his behaviors, and revealing truths about Colt that, because of his initial amnesia, he's yet to realize himself. And yet, there's also a sweetness to their interactions at times, like a couple in the heat of an argument remembering for just a moment why they care about each other. She's a confusing presence, in one breath chastising him for his actions and in another encouraging them. She guides him to objectives and then lays the guilt on thick when he achieves them.In a very real sense, she's a pure agent of chaos and her motivations remain unclear until just the right moment. The voice acting is absolutely crucial to selling this relationship and in that regard, it is achieved exceptionally well thanks to the outstanding delivery by Jason E. Kelley and Ozioma Akagha as Colt and Julianna respectively. Some lines from Julianna have a mischievous tone while others are tinged with spite and growing frustration. For his part, Colt begins unsure of himself and unclear of why this woman has it in for him, but as he learns more, he becomes confident, choosing to engage in the verbal jousts and starting getting under her skin. The constant back and forths between the two is genuinely a joy to listen to and the writing is sharp to make the development of their relationship feel natural.The main focus of Colt's attention, however, is the aforementioned Visionaries who need to be offed, and this is where Deathloop's open-ended gameplay does the heavy lifting. Blackreef is split up into multiple districts, and each one is usually home to at least one of the Visionaries. Colt's objective is to enter an area and figure out how to get himself into a position where he can kill said Visionary and take their Slab, an item that gives them one of the six unique supernatural abilities. But it's not as simple as running into a building and gunning them down as each of the Visionaries is… a weirdo. Charlie, for example, has transformed a part of Updaam into a low-budget escape room made up of multiple themed floors, complete with puzzles and a whole lot of weapon-wielding Eternalists standing between the entrance and him. Harriet has taken up residence in a Karl's Bay hanger, where she's hosting a group wellness session that is as sinister as it sounds. Wenjie is a super smart scientist who is responsible for harnessing the strange energy of the time loop to create the slabs and rarely leaves her lab in The Complex, but you might find yourself facing an existential conundrum when you're face to face with her.Deathloop is a game where observation and dynamic thinking go hand-in-hand with shotgunning goons in the face and snapping their necks ... it delivers bombastic thrills and wince-inducing kills with intelligence and elegance in equal measureDeathloop's day-and-night cycle also means that these Visionaries are only available at certain times of the day. Although you can manually progress time to your needs, there's only ever a specific window of opportunity to kill a Visionary. That means you need to play through time loops repeatedly, puzzling out a plan to execute it when the time is right. The game makes this more manageable by giving the player Visionary Leads to follow. These are quest chains that guide the player to key pieces of information necessary to pull off the assassination and will often take Colt through different environments at different times of the day. You may need the code to a door in Fristad Rock, for example, but a ledger with that information is being stored in an office elsewhere that can only be accessed when a worker leaves the door open in the afternoon.The result of this approach is that you're slowly trained to develop a meticulous understanding of each area in the game. And as your Colt grows in strength and capabilities, so too does your proficiency in navigating them. After killing a Visionary you gain a power, which can be used in the following time loops, provided you invest in it. This growth comes by way of Residuum that can be extracted from charged objects in the environment or, in more abundance, from the dead body of a Visionary. By channeling this resource into weapons and items, you're able to hold onto them between loops. Slab powers are the most essential as they give you a significant ability, and killing a Visionary repeatedly to take their slab will evolve the power. The Shift power, for example, lets you teleport much like Dishonored's Blink. But by repeatedly killing the Visionary wielding it and collecting it, you're able to upgrade the power to let you travel further or hover in the air briefly. Aether lets you turn invisible but becomes more effective if you upgrade it so its effect doesn't wear off when you attack.Along with powers, Trinkets are also littered throughout the world and come in two flavors. Weapon trinkets can be used to augment your combat abilities by improving stats like range, power, and aim-down-sights speed. Personal trinkets, meanwhile, enhance Colt's performance by improving health regeneration, decreasing the amount of noise he makes when moving, or adjusting how his power meter depletes and recovers, among other things. And these all come in multiple color-coded tiers of effectiveness. The presence of these is what makes each time loop consistently rewarding to play through, even if you fail to achieve a bigger objective. Sometimes it can be good to do a run through an area or even an entire loop to build your Residuum balance and collect some more trinkets, especially since it's also an opportunity to refine your chosen playstyle a bit more. There's nothing quite like deciding to run into an area with your guns blazing just so you can chew through Eternalists and a Visionary, knowing that you're doing it just to grab resources. Since Colt is able to come back from death twice, there is a degree of forgiveness in the game that really encourages doing wacky things when the opportunity arises. That third death will reset the loop entirely though, so some strategy is also required if you want to make the most of your time.Very quickly, you'll find yourself developing a level of mastery over the world thanks to the powers and weapons that you've accumulated. A Visionary kill that initially took 20 minutes can be reduced to just a couple as you dart around environments, stealthing through one group of enemies, while laying siege to another, and ultimately cutting through your target before they've even realized what's happening. The repetition-based design of Deathloop eases you into creating a flow state that you can enter into and exit from at will. With the character development systems, it gamifies trial and error so effectively that failures almost always still feel like small triumphs. This might sound typical, given the prominence of recent roguelite games such as Hades, but Deathloop's gameplay feels entirely of its own brand, and that is because it's built on the foundation of Arkane's domino-effect design.That is especially apparent as you uncover dead ends, of which there are many scattered around Deathloop's various environments. Documents peppered around the world will provide a small lead on something, which is then marked as a discovery, and the game does an excellent job of creating a breadcrumb trail around Blackreef for you to follow, and it always leads to something meaningful. Whether it's finding the code to open a locked door you stumbled upon hours ago or figuring out how to manipulate two Visionaries into appearing at the same place at the same time, you're never more than a run or two away from having an epiphany. And when it dawns upon you, the feeling will make you giddy. It's like using just the right wrench to loosen a nut that felt like it was impossibly tight.In many regards, Deathloop is a game about being meticulous, and Arkane has done a fantastic job in making just being in the world, looking around, and listening to it enthralling. It should come as no surprise that Blackreef is absolutely stunning to behold, given the strong sense of art direction the studio's previous games have had. Each of the four areas of the game has a distinct style, which changes depending on the time of day thanks to lighting and even weather effects. There's a wonderful retro pop-art motif that runs throughout, with eye-catching posters and signs that not only furnish each environment to be visually pleasing, but also serve as a kind of pathway for the player to explore. Architecture is constructed thoughtfully so, in any given scenario, you can see a way in and a way out. On the ground level, a neon billboard may draw your attention, revealing scaffolding that can be clambered up to give you a better vantage point. Or a spotlight on a stone wall may gesture towards an open window, offering a way into a building that otherwise seems impregnable.Of particular note are the '60s-esque interiors that are somehow both beautiful and utterly garish in the way only retro furniture can be. Wooden walls, shocking red pleather couches that look like they would make your arse numb after a minute of sitting on them, and oddly contorted lighting fixtures will stop you in your tracks so you can ogle how strange they are. But they also fit into the aesthetic so perfectly that you can't help but be impressed by the interior design chops being displayed. Needless to say, Arkane's sense of art direction remains impeccable and, for my money, unmatched.And complementing it is the raucous soundtrack that is as eclectic and as unexpected as the visual stylings. Continuing the mashup of style and themes, Deathloop transitions effortlessly between disparate styles to suit the needs of the moment from a cinematic standpoint, but also has you tapping your feet along to the chaos happening on screen. One minute you're creeping through underground tunnels, backed by the bleeps, bloops, and ambient warbles of old sci-fi movies in tense stealth sections, and the next you're engaged in an all-out gunfight with hordes of Eternalists to the sound of a big band orchestra and off-the-chain sax solos. Deathloop's gunplay is weighty and satisfying, and a great deal of the thrill that comes from trading lead is elevated by the brilliant, funky soundtrack.The final piece to Deathloop's gameplay puzzle is multiplayer, which manifests itself in two ways. The first is technically not multiplayer, as it sees Julianna invade Colt's game to try and assassinate him. This Julianna is computer-controlled but no less deadly for it. At random points, the game announces that Julianna has invaded and locked the exit points out the area. The only way to escape is to hack a specific point to unlock the exit tunnels, but to do that you have to go through her. These moments are genuinely terrifying, especially when you're on a good run. Julianna is capable of masking her appearance to look like any random Eternalist, so she could really be anywhere and anyone. And when she does have you in her crosshairs you better hope you have her in yours. She can be ruthless, but the reward for taking her out is massive. She will often drop a Slab, meaning you can acquire powers or upgrades without needing to kill the Visionary who has them. And if you're smart, you can even set up elaborate traps using turrets and grenades to get the jump on her.Of course, a human player--someone on your friends list, a random person on the internet, or even you--can choose to protect the loop by assuming the role of Julianna. As the hunter, you invade Colt's world with the goal of taking him out before he can kill you or escape. Unlike Colt, who has that ability to undo his deaths a couple of times, Julianna has just one shot at her mark, which means you need to be much more considered. However, the ability to mimic NPCs is a devious advantage that is much more effective than you might think, especially if you have a good understanding of the world and can use a player's knowledge against them.For example, you may know that there's a specific enemy that is always positioned in a specific spot and, if you're able to swap positions with them, the Colt player may just assume you're a harmless Eternalist, only for you to strike when they least suspect it. You can also use powers that are unlocked gradually as you continue to invade players. Julianna has her own progression tree that tasks her with completing feats such as successfully killing Colt in a specific way, surviving for a certain period of time, using a particular weapon, and so on. As you complete these, more Slab abilities, weapons, and trinkets become available, making you a deadlier killer. The sense of tension this introduces to gameplay is exhilarating as you never know when a Julianna could appear to turn your world upside down. It harkens back to the kind of hide-and-seek multiplayer introduced in Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood and the PvP of the Soulsborne games, and it works really well within Deathloop. Of course, you can opt not to allow people to invade if you'd prefer a purely single-player experience.Perhaps the most laudable part of Deathloop is how it takes so many seemingly disparate things and creates harmony between them. Gameplay systems that feel isolated become pieces of a bigger puzzle, and when you see how they seamlessly connect together, you realize how special an achievement it really is. Similarly, on paper, the different aesthetics should be like oil and water, but they come together effortlessly to be part of a greater whole, and, for me, that's what Deathloop is really about. By standing back and looking at the bigger picture, the uncharacteristic choices and unexpected behaviors feel necessary--essential even. Maybe it's just what I need to believe to give all that killing meaning, but when I began the final loop and carved a perfect, bloody path through Blackreef's Visionaries in a single day, I made no ripples.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"
Deathloop,Ethan Gach,Kotaku,https://kotaku.com/deathloop-review-game-pass-playstation-plus-arkane-1847725473,"Video games are inescapably intertwined with iteration and do-overs. It’s written into the technology that builds them, the development practices that craft them, and often the very rules governing how they work: win-lose, trial and error. Some games have tried to mask this artifice in the service of more naturalistic storytelling. Deathloop embraces it. Up to a point.Dying fuels its story and propels its fun. Not to a satisfying conclusion, but one I couldn’t turn away from. Like its tragic hero, Colt Vahn, I also wanted to break the loop, if not so I could escape the purgatory of 1960s pastiche, then at least so I could put the game down, content in the knowledge that I had exhausted most of its possibilities. What felt like a blank canvas at first turned out to be a paint-by-numbers one, and the image eventually revealed felt like one I’d seen plenty of times before. Deathloop’s fundamentals are so strong. I wish the rest of the game was too.Arkane Studios’ latest immersive murder sim plays like its predecessors but with an important new twist: you’re trapped on a mysterious island in a repeating 24-hour time loop. Colt was originally chief security officer for the AEON Program, a group of eccentric societal elites who call themselves Visionaries and command a cult-like army of masked lackeys called Eternalists. They took over the island of Blackreef to leverage its anomaly for the shallow immortality of the time loop, and now Colt has betrayed them because he wants out. Julianna Blake, the only other Visionary whose memories carry over day to day, wants to stay, so she spends every day trying to hunt him down. The setup is high-society James Bond meets the paranoia of The Prisoner with A Clockwork Orange’s hyper-violent menace coursing throughout, which is to say an excellent premise for a video game as long as you don’t think about it for too long. Voiced by Jason E. Kelley and Ozioma Akagha respectively, Colt and Julianna are the heart anchoring Deathloop’s heady conceit. In between bouts of killing each other they joke, they curse, and occasionally they make themselves movingly vulnerable with one another. They’re two of Arkane’s best characters ever, elevated by two of the most memorable game performances in recent years, and aided by one of the period’s least cringy video game scripts to boot. Where other games might have veered into a ditch of grim melodrama, Deathloop swerves, holding just enough back to preserve the independence and richness of its leads.To escape eternity, Colt needs to kill the AEON Program’s eight remaining leaders, some of whom have gained strange powers thanks to the anomaly powering the loop. Unlike Arkane’s previous Dishonored trilogy, in which assassinations typically play out sequentially, Colt’s project requires learning about his targets’ routines and uncovering their secrets until he can come up with a way to murder them all in one day.It can be exhilarating, even daunting, but Deathloop is not as ambiguous or free-flowing as it first appears. There are four separate, sprawling levels which can each be played at four different times of day. Each time you complete one, time moves forward a notch. When you die, the day resets. When you survive, the day resets. The result is 16 slightly different levels you can scour for clues and objectives on repeat, until you acquire enough information to execute the murder spree that will take out all your targets in one fell swoop. ""I don't know why I'm killing you but it sure is fun"" Thought experiment about what would happen if you dropped the cast of Mad Men onto the island from Lost and made them repeat icebreakers for eternity. Strong leads, luminous art direction, grisly murder spreesBoring time loop mechanic, grindy progression, lonely levelsArkane Studios PS5 (played), PCSeptember 14, 2021Just over 25 hours. Completed the main story and saw two of three endings. Maxed out Slab upgrades and completed about half of the unique gun quests. This information sticks with you loop after loop, and while there’s not a strict order of events for accumulating it, once acquired, its applications are disappointingly linear. There is only one order in which you can kill everyone, and if you leave the objective markers on, the game will methodically funnel you toward the one true way to break the loop. The game had a plan and it made me stick to it. The time loop doesn’t create new possibilities. It just jumbles up the old ones.Deathloop gets going for real a few hours in, after a convoluted opening that mercilessly bombards you with explanations and on-screen tutorial prompts. At this point you earn the ability to infuse guns, upgrades, and powers, called Slabs, so you can carry them over as part of your loadout from one loop to the next. Absorbing glowy psychedelic material from random objects and dead Visionaries nets you Residuum, a resource which you can then spend on building out your arsenal.At times it’s like playing a full-fledged loot shooter, albeit one that feels cleaner and more tactile than the convoluted transactional experiences that label usually conjures up. Intricately rendered guns pop and vibrate with an intense, distinct recoil when fired, occasionally jamming when you’re in the middle of getting killed, each suspenseful click and clack of the hot metal pleasingly relayed by the haptic feedback of the PS5’s Dualsense. Arkane worked with Machine Games on Wolfenstein: Youngblood and that series’ weighty and pristine shooting has been admirably recreated in Deathloop.Less thrilling is what Deathloop has borrowed from loot shooters to pad out its progression. It has random drops. It has colors to denote rarity. It even has epic loot you get from dedicated side-quests. There are no stat sheets but guns do roll with special perks. The Rapier scout rifle can drop with a buffed zoom or with shorter range and quicker reloads. A vampiric submachine gun will restore some of your health every time you deal damage. And then there’s my favorite: a hand cannon with bullets that spawn poisonous clouds of flammable gas, blowing up mobs of squishy Eternalists in just a few shots. Each gun can equip extra perks called Trinkets as well, with higher rarity weapons granting more slots.There is no skill tree, but Colt can equip a range of Slabs and personal upgrades once they’re acquired. Your first Slab, which stays equipped at all times, is Reprise, which revives you twice per level. Others include familiar Arkane abilities like double-jumps and the teleporational Blink (called “Shift” here). There’s also Aether which lets you turn almost completely invisible, and of course the endlessly gratifying Karnesis with which you can toss enemies off their feet and through the air and, with the right upgrade, make them explode like a grenade when they hit the ground again. I wanted there to be more of these powers (there are only five Slabs in total) or at least the ability to equip more than two at a time (I could never bring myself to unequip Shift). Having my loadout limited in this way didn’t inspire more targeted strategies; it just left me constantly pining for all the Slabs I’d chosen to leave behind that time around.You get these powers and upgrades by killing Visionaries over and over again until they drop, which isn’t the worst thing in the world, but also isn’t nearly as interesting as a bunch of other things I could imagine doing in Blackreef. And this is one of the places Deathloop’s cherry-picking from other genres gets in the way of what Arkane games do best. There are surprisingly few permutations to this grind, since the most efficient way of going about it often includes Shifting to the Visionary’s location, killing everyone in the vicinity, and then Shifting back to the exit as quickly as possible. This sort of grunt work is standard fare for the looter shooter but feels at odds with the bespoke environments Arkane has gone to such lengths to construct. As fun as Deathloop’s shooting is, I wish its randomized progression had been built around the information you’re after rather than whether a gun is blue, purple, or gold.Charlie Montague’s LARP in Updaam is a good example of how each level’s interesting edges get sanded off by repetition. Charlie owns the Slab that enables Shift, the most integral power in the game, and I’ve spent hours mugging this narcissistic programmer to complete my collection of teleportation abilities. The first time I approached his haunted house-like facility, I did so timidly, unsure of what I’d find there and cautious of jeopardizing my latest run with an untimely reset.A cheeky computer called 2-BIT running off of a part of Charlie’s brain narrates the journey. “New player. Hi! Your character is: [THE INVADER]. A arousing choice!” it says near the start. (I am not aroused but I am in love: 2-BIT is far and away Deathloop’s best NPC). More acerbic dialogue follows as you make your way through a Lost In Space-style movie set, with Eternalists lumbering around every corner. Your prize is buried in the heart of the makeshift maze on the third floor.Before I had the Shift power, I tried to methodically sneak up through each layer of the charade before eventually getting the jump on Charlie and then escaping out the back. It was difficult and riveting, combining the stakes of a low-health stealth game with a candy bag of grenades and machine guns for when the shit hit the fan.I’ve been back a half dozen times since, scaling the outside of the building, disabling trip-wire explosives, grabbing the bounty and tearing back out again without taking a second look. The excitement of the first successful run has now been crowded out by the drudgery of all the others, from scared, to overpowered, to yawning between clocking in and back out again. There is a way to kill Charlie by launching the real rocket attached to his game in the center of the facility, but you can’t get the passcode to do so until much later, and by then it feels anticlimactic.As a narrative device the loop has had its intended effect. I wanted out, just like Colt. But from a gameplay perspective it left me feeling like I’d just chugged an expensive bottle of wine. Long before you escape the loop you’ve already overcome its core dangers and complications by infusing powerful guns and Slabs. You might have to redo a level—Deathloop only autosaves in-between them—but you haven’t really lost progress, just your time. These do-overs quickly begin feeling less like opportunities to experiment than temporary reboots to the overarching grind. Deathloop’s second half is still a fun power trip, but by then its loop mechanic feels perfunctory at best.Julianna is the one wrinkle to this. While you’re off hunting other Visionaries, she can randomly appear in levels and hunt you, setting up a radar beacon that locks the exits to your tunnels until you hack them. It’s terrifying early on. And also lucrative. Successfully killing Julianna will get you a big haul of Residuum, guns, and sometimes a Slab upgrade. It would be an ingenious wrinkle by itself, but Deathloop’s multiplayer transforms it into something more.Play online and when Julianna invades she’s controlled by another player, a big upgrade over the game’s predictable enemy AI. It’s a novel approach to raising the late-game stakes, and probably Deathloop’s most important contribution to all of the genre sandboxes it’s playing in. At least when it’s not sabotaged by lag, crashes, or other bugs. Julianna has a whole upgrade path of her own, unlocking better weapons and powers the more you successfully “protect the loop” from strangers playing as Colt. It’s not as seamlessly integrated into the main campaign’s progression, or rewarding enough, to keep on when you want to finish the game for real, but it’s the first new multiplayer mode in a while that I’ve found myself going back to again and again. It’s excellent, even if it’s not ultimately enough to save Deathloop from itself.The allure of Dishonored, Deus Ex, and other immersive sims, is being dropped into a strange place and then being left to your own devices, deploying a small arsenal of weapons, tools, and powers to navigate it. When done well, it feels like being a teenager dropped off at the mall with no responsibilities and a lot of pocket change. It feels like you could do anything, even if you’re probably just gonna buy a soda and some pizza and annoy the rentacops for a couple hours. Simply having a few options at your fingertips and no one looking over your shoulder transforms limited possibilities into an intoxicating sense of boundlessness.Despite sprawling levels and a lack of consequences, Deathloop rarely feels so freeing. Colt’s hideout, a series of underground tunnels that let him traverse the island stealthily and at will, is home to a corkboard overflowing with his targets’ schedules, connections, and secrets, mapped out with zigzagging strands of red string. In the game’s clues menu, however, these messy intersections are carefully laid out in neat, approachable sequences. Deathloop’s biggest revelation ends up having nothing to do with its world building or characters. Instead, it’s the equivalent of turning around at the mall and realizing your parents were spying on you the entire time.The island is home to gorgeous playgrounds bustling with an impressive level of detail, places that elevate killing to an art form that can be as creative as it is destructive. But I never fell under Blackreef’s spell the way I have Arkane’s previous worlds. It does indeed feel like the studio dropped some of Frank Loyd Wright’s houses onto one of the Faroe islands, inspirations Arkane has referenced in interviews. It dazzles, and some of the juxtapositions are stunning, but it occasionally feels more like exploring a billionaire’s Airbnb than slinking through the shadows of the postwar era’s burgeoning cultural revolution.Deathloop is a deeply kinetic game where everything feels at its best and most satisfying when you’re on the move, teleporting around cover and force-pushing people off rooftops. And as repetitious as it can be, the act of moving, shooting, and engineering the slaughter of dozens of costumed enemies is so exquisitely tuned that the mischief never loses its lively spark.Beneath its stylish mid-century modern decor and abandoned military installation intrigue, however, Deathloop can be a grindy and all too familiar affair. Its constituent parts are mostly excellent, but never cohere into something more than just a good shooter with a clever premise. This doesn’t stop it from being a good game, but it could have been a much more surprising one."

DEATHLOOP REVIEW FOR PC AND PS5.With Deathloop, developer Arkane Studios clearly aims to incorporate lessons learned from Dishonored, Prey, and earlier games with a new invasion element that adds multiplayer to the mix. It’s this latter element that I was most interested in playing and, perhaps unsurprisingly, it’s the game’s standout feature. I’ve waited a week since the game’s launch to write this review, putting in the hours with the general public to properly assess how invasions play out.I love time travel stories and Deathloop perfectly captures the chaos that can ensue when temporal fabrics are fiddled with. In this instance, there’s an island that’s stuck in a loop, repeating the day over and over again.It’s up to the player, who’s put in the shoes of the wonderfully-voiced Colt, to stop the loop. Ending the cycle means taking out eight targets all on the same day. These enemies are situated on different levels and appear at different times, so it’s initially impossible to take them all out.Colt must work to gather information about each target and use that against them. These reconnaissance missions take up the bulk of the playthrough and they are, unfortunately, not very interesting from a gameplay perspective. You warp in, grab whatever you need, and then warp out. There are no difficulty settings, either, so you quickly learn that enemies pose very little threat.Armed with the new intel, Colt is able to coordinate his murders. The pay-off is great, as you retread familiar ground to move effortlessly between missions, knowing where everyone will be and exactly what is going to happen. This culminates in a memorable finale, though I was hoping for something unexpected to throw Colt through one final loop. Sadly, it ends when you think it will end, and I saw the credits roll after 12 hours.To aid Colt on his mission to wipe out the eight Visionaries causing the island to loop continuously, he has an arsenal of weapons and abilities. Weapons can be collected from all enemies and abilities are taken from the boss encounters. There are also Trinkets that bestow Colt himself with additional buffs. These can all be “Infused” so that they can keep them between loops.Unfortunately, I quickly found my go-to loadout that I was happy to plow through the game with and I found no reason to upgrade. I happily let the loop discard new loot without a second thought, as filtering through the inventory takes too long. I only really cared about the ability upgrades, especially for invisibility, dash, and damage reduction. Everything else seemed more like a sidegrade.If the enemies provided a bigger challenge I would have cared more about micromanaging the equipment I used, but its artificial intelligence is alarmingly unintelligent. While it’s a joy to dance around the AI and know their patrol patterns, making me feel like the King of Time Travel, I never felt at risk of dying by their hands. Colt almost immediately gets the “Reprise” ability, which essentially gives him three lives. It’s like a mandatory easy mode and removes any tension.While stealth is an option, the game doesn’t shame you for choosing to run and gun. I remember when Dishonored made me feel like a failure when the enemy was alerted. Deathloop does no such thing, instead giving you the tools to go on a rampage and eradicate entire levels of enemies.“Eradicate entire levels of enemies” might sound impressive, but the truth is that the levels aren’t very big. There are only four main areas in total and they are smaller than I was expecting. Considering how many times players are going to be revisiting them, there’s too little there. With that said, for those interested in the lore and reading their video games instead of playing them, Arkane has included a bunch of letters, diaries, and whatnot that help to shape the world.The levels might be small, but they at least look pretty good. On PS5 there are three different visual modes. Players can choose between a 60 FPS target for smoothness or higher fidelity visuals but at a lower frame rate.I stuck with the 60 FPS performance mode. The game still looks good and the frame rate is mostly solid. I did notice drops when moving quickly through a level and when Julianna was invading, but these hiccups were few and far between. It plays nicely on PS5, though I know PC players have been experiencing issues that Arkane recently acknowledged.Where Deathloop truly shines is its multiplayer. It’s a simple idea: Julianna, a Visionary hellbent on preventing Colt from stopping the loop, invades the level and tries to eliminate you. With the game set to “Online,” and assuming the playerbase remains populated, this will often be a real-world player.The occasions where Julianna invaded were easily the highlights of my playthrough. It’s a game of cat and mouse, and avoiding or hunting her down is a true thrill. Her powers aren’t as good as Colt’s and she only has one life, but she can disguise herself and see Colt’s position when other enemies spot him.Even when I lose the fight, I find invasions so thrilling that I’ve become addicted. I now load into a map and hunt down Julianna as quickly as possible. Or, I play as Julianna and aim to rapidly dispatch Colt with brutal aggression. It’s so much fun and I encourage everyone who plays this game to set it to “Online” and avoid single-player, which drastically waters down the experience and ruins the magic.Speedy. #PS5Share, #DEATHLOOP pic.twitter.com/gm2Gnauo71— Mack Ashworth (@GamingWithMack) September 19, 2021The multiplayer is not perfect, though, and I’ve noticed a few cracks in the week since launch. First, matchmaking times can be very long. When you consider that this is when the game should be at its peak player count, that’s pretty worrying. There’s no cross-play support, either, so the player pools are already kneecapped. Xbox players will have a better time when the game comes out on Xbox Series X|S, as it’s to be featured in the Xbox Game Pass, but PC and PS5 players have no such solution.My next concern is the overpowered execution moves. These are OP in single-player, too, but it’s during Colt and Julianna fights where the issue is most prevalent. Jumping over either character allows for a quick instant kill. These executions from above and the front should be disabled when the characters have been spotted.My other main concern is the antennae location. There is only one location on each map, so encounters often play out the same, and not in a good way. I can use the antennae location and knowledge that Julianna will spawn near it to achieve ridiculously aggressive plays as seen in the above tweet.At its best, Deathloop successfully captures the essence of those time-travel movies where the protagonist moves with suave confidence as they know where every enemy will be and how to flawlessly execute their plan.In order to avoid the tedium organically produced by playing the same level over and over, Arkane has implemented a truly magical multiplayer component, one that has the potential to offer top-tier multiplayer moments. Unfortunately, the weak recon missions made too easy by the lack of challenge from AI enemies, the small number of maps that are quickly mastered, and the limited variety in gameplay burdened by uninspired upgrades, ultimately prevent Deathloop from reaching the highest of highs.With online multiplayer enabled and embraced, however, it becomes easier to overlook the weak points and Deathloop comes out on the other side as a compelling lesson in how intimate multiplayer can greatly enhance the single-player formula.Deathloop was reviewed on PS5 with code provided by the publisher.8Mack is slowly grinding his way to Level 100.

Developer: Arkane Studios
Publisher: Bethesda
Released: September 14, 2021
MSRP: $59.99Still reading? Well I won’t give away too much!“Groundhog Day with two assassins by way of Arkane” sums up the premise of Deathloop, which is enough to entice a large chunk of people; especially Dishonored and Prey fans. Arkane definitely dips into the font of those two games, and ends up pouring a refreshing drink that’s generally bolder, and more flavorful than several past efforts.Personality is not a problem in Deathloop, for one. Colt, your avatar and the main event of this time-looping mess, is more interesting than the entire cast of most modern AAA games. The banter between him and Julianna (his rival) is glorious, and manages to rise above the typical edgy dialogue of a lot of shooters by actually making you laugh out loud. The ’60s decor and fashion sense help bring out that personality more, especially with all that marvelous wood-based interior design! Nothing better than techy sci-fi clashing with wood.Deathloop‘s primary weapon is that it doesn’t take itself too seriously. The game highly encourages experimentation, loadout swapping, and exploration, and makes all of that very easy. The way the core loop (as it were) works is that you have an ultimate end goal in mind, but an unlimited amount of time to figure out how to do it. “Days” are broken up by morning, afternoon, and evening periods; all of which feature different environmental changes in four areas (connected by central tunnels, which you start and end every period in), and have key NPCs (Visionaries, which are basically bosses) in different spots. During all this, Julianna can randomly pop in as an extra encounter, both as an AI or as another player.Loadouts, initially, are tenuous at best. You can’t keep all of your gear between loops, but very early you discover a mechanic that lets you pump what is essentially leveling currency into keeping items permanently. While a lot of games would make this process deliberately obtuse and annoying, I had what I could consider an “ideal” personal loadout in a little over an hour of playtime. From there, it was mainly tweaking, and adding extra flair for specific encounters (sneaking around, versus head-on fighting/boss battles).It’s a very, very chill game with a lot going on, which is a feat to balance both so well. In case you’re worried, it doesn’t feel anything like a roguelike or a roguelite. The time loop gimmick actually serves the player at a foundational level, which really helped me become invested in it: I couldn’t stop playing from the time I installed it. Deathloop gets very fun to play very fast because it’s willing to get kooky and arcadey. Case in point: I was given a double-jump almost immediately and it was off to the races.What are essentially magic powers (conducted through relics called “slates”) supercharge everything, providing access to berserker strength, stealth, teleportation, and more. Colt’s unique power is that he can die three times each day before starting over a loop: essentially providing you with three lives (complete with the now-classic “loot your corpse to regain your currency” conceit). Arkane could have gone the gritty route with grounded Call of Duty style clamboring and sliding (which is in!), but they plussed it up. Getting these powers is meaningful, too, as bosses (which respawn every day) basically poop out materia, which you can then pay to keep permanently (dupe abilities will provide upgrades).Beyond chipping away at the critical path, part of the joy is slowly uncovering the mystery of why you’re in the loop, and I’ll basically leave it at that. The in-game mission screen is centered around this premise, offering a conspiracy theory style pinboard to help you slowly unravel everything. You can do multiple parts at once depending on the area you’re in, or take it bit by bit, and start fresh the next day.However you choose to play, the game saves your mission progress/knowledge like passcodes and major revelations: so you don’t need to repeat a ton of things over and over until you get it perfectly right (nor do you have to memorize what you were doing). Again, Arkane could have gone so south with the number of roguelike elements they could have crammed in, but it really does play like an action-adventure that just happens to take place in a time loop.All of these mechanics help facilitate cycle-based runs through a selection of four sandboxes that are combed through the way you want to. It isn’t perfect though. I encountered a few instances of “go here…oh actually now that you’re here, you need to come back in the morning.” Great! At least I had the opportunity to scour the immediate area, have some fun, head back, keep what I wanted by investing in those items, then dive back into the zone within a few minutes. Slightly annoying, but ultimately painless.What wasn’t as painless was my encounter with several glitches on PS5, all of them menu-based. Sometimes when selecting a loadout the menu won’t load, and on a few occasions, it locked up and didn’t let me quit or start a mission. The only solution was to reboot, which let me pick up right where I left off due to the auto-save system. Your mileage may vary, but I encountered menu lag twice (which cleared up after 30 seconds), and soft crashing twice.What I find especially fun is the post-mission “run back.” It’s a blast to figure out different paths to return to the tunnels before the next time period begins each day while all hell is breaking loose, and Deathloop entices you to come back under different circumstances to encounter new activities. None of the zones feel bloated: they’re packed just enough to warrant multiple runs without getting old, without providing the sense that they’re jammed with Ubisoft open world busywork.At what I would call a “medium pace,” I finished Deathloop in around 10 hours (after the game ends, you can repeat the final day or start over). Part of the genius is that if you want to rush it, you can. If you want to take twice as long, you can too. There’s a lot of speedrunning potential in Deathloop, and I’m stoked to see what people come up with as the “optimal way to solve the game.”The other part of Deathloop is playing as Julianna, which has a very 2010s “we need multiplayer in this game” feel at first, but ends up being a bonus rather than something that detracts from Deathloop as a whole. Your job is to dive into another (human) Colt’s game via matchmaking, and take them out, similar to invading a game in a Souls joint. It has its own loadout screen and progression system, as well as a few subtle story bits. You can even turn off human invasions and restrict them entirely to AI as Colt. What I’m saying is you can ignore it, but it’s also justified.Extra mode or not, the main game is not compromised in any way. Deathloop combines a classic Arkane stealthy-shooty foundation with a genuinely interesting and fun premise to aplomb. This is going to be on a lot of Game of the Year lists.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]SuperbA hallmark of excellence. There may be flaws, but they are negligible and won't cause massive damage.

Deathloop,TJ Denzer,Shacknews,https://www.shacknews.com/article/126603/deathloop-review-a-vicious-cycle,"New to Shacknews? Signup for a Free AccountAlready have an account? Login NowAt long last, Deathloop is here to challenge us to crack its elaborate time-skipping murder puzzle, but is it a cycle worth repeating?For about two years, Arkane Studios has been preparing an interesting evolution of its games in Deathloop. It’s a first-person action shooter in which you replay the same day in an effort to kill eight targets scattered throughout an island of people ready to kill you on sight. It was a bit hard to grasp for a while, but the outcome is something amazing. Mixing stealth, weighty gunplay, supernatural powers, and play-your-way weapons and gadgets, Deathloop is a greatest-hits amalgam of Arkane style with a splash of grindhouse grittiness and a satisfying murder puzzle narrative to put it apart from anything that has come before.In Deathloop, you play as the rough and tumble Colt Vahn. Colt wakes up one morning on the island of Blackreef, which is home to a society that enjoys the luxury of living the same day in an endless time loop. They are ordered to kill Colt on sight because he betrayed the organization that created the loop and is trying to break free of it. If Colt is going to get away from this cycle of death, he has to kill eight “Visionary” targets that keep the loop stabilized in the span of one day. Easier said than done as they’re scattered across the island with their own agendas and routines. All of it makes for an elaborate murder puzzle you’re going to have to put together piece by piece, learning more with each repeat of the day and the opportunities your collected information gives you.If that wasn’t enough, Colt has a constant companion through his time looping journey. The only other person on Blackreef that seems to keep their memory loop after loop is Julianna Blake, who oversees hunting Colt down and making sure he doesn’t break the cycle. Julianna likes to stay in touch with Colt, whether through radio contact in which the two share regular banter or through trying to put a bullet in his noggin when she arrives in a zone he’s exploring. Julianna and Colt’s conversations are some of the funniest parts of the game and where secrets pertaining to the island, why everyone is there, and how things ended up the way they did come out.Those conversations also help set the tone of the game. Deathloop is extremely grindhouse in its nature. Everything is brash and dirty. You have weapons that mostly look like they were cobbled together from scrap and yet somehow feel great, and the island has all sorts of scenery, from squalor and repurposed old structures to scientific facilities, bunkers, art installations, and snazzy clubs. The island of Blackreef is generally breathtaking and each area takes on drastically new life as you progress through a day unraveling its secrets.All of this is also aided by a fantastic soundtrack that keeps the vibe electric whether you’re sneaking about like a silent assassin or making a ruckus with a loud and proud shotgun. In particular, there’s a core tune that feels like it’s repackaged nicely across the various areas, sounding jazzy when you’re fighting in the club or sounding a little close to the riff of Led Zeppelin’s Whole Lotta Love when you’re fighting your way across the scarred bunker area of the island. I really loved how well the music of this game played and adapted into whatever I was doing. It ties a delightful bow on a immersive package of narrative, puzzle-solving, and combat.So let’s talk about how you actually do go about breaking the loop and escaping Blackreef’s insanity. Guns and powers aren’t your primary weapon in Deathloop. Rather, information is the greatest weapon of all in this game. Each day, you get to explore different locations like Karl’s Bay or Fristad Rock during four different times of the day: Morning, Noon, Afternoon, and Night. Time won’t move forward till you leave a region to head back to your hideout. However, as you explore different places, you will find different clues that are either universal to the location or specific to a time of day. For instance, one Visionary can only be found in Karl’s Bay in the Morning, then they disappear.By exploring different places during different times of day, you glean clues and leads that will help you arm yourself better or optimize Visionary kills. With a running tab on info from everywhere you explore at every time, it’s all a very smart design that will have you valuing every clue as if it were gold. The only thing that can be tough about this is that your life can be depleted three times throughout the day. After the third time, you die for good and have to restart the day, losing anything you haven’t preserved through a special method. That can be deflating when you’re on the cusp of a breakthrough only to be gunned down at the finish line.Not to say the real weapons aren’t rather fun. Deathloop has quite the arsenal for whether players want to play loud or silent. There are a number of basic weapon categories, as well as higher quality versions and variations of them. For instance, there’s a machine gun that puts out a hailstorm of bullets, but if you find a purple variant of it, it might make enemies explode when you kill them with headshots. You also might find a nail gun that lets you kill enemies far easier if you mark them first. You can also upgrade both the weapons and Colt with Trinkets. These equippable modifications add things like better firing rate, higher damage, and faster reloads to guns. Meanwhile, Trinkets for Colt give him perks like taking less damage, finding more ammo, and not taking damage from big falls, just to name a few effects.Then there’s the Slabs. These give you supernatural powers. Only Visionaries and Julianna have them and getting them is tough, but oh so worth it. They allow you to do typical Arkane things like blink forward through space or turn invisible, but I think my favorite was Nexux. It allows you to link enemies in close proximity together and kill them all by taking out one. It’s absolutely delicious when you cue it up on three or more people and then pump a shot from a silenced nail gun into one noggin to silently ice a whole crew. Weapons, trinkets, and powers thoroughly cater to your needs in Deathloop and they feel great. You also eventually get a method to preserve your favorite gear so you can keep them through loops. That way, you can keep and evolve your favored playstyle throughout the game and capture some very lovely rare weapons to keep for your collection.I mentioned Julianna has some good stuff and that will come into play quite often. If you’re in an area with a Visionary and you haven’t already killed her that day, there’s a chance Julianna will appear to lock your escape route and hunt you till she kills you or you kill her. She will be played by AI or another player based on your settings. Regardless, if you kill her, you can get a ton of good gear off of her, as well as an assured power Slab.I played as her as well and it’s fun hunting Colt. He has three lives and you have one, so you can absolutely be devious about it, hiding among henchmen, taking up ranks alongside a Visionary, and setting traps for him. For him, he gets your good gear if you die, but for you, killing Colt helps you raise your Hunter Rank. Higher Hunter Ranks let you equip Julianna with expanded loadouts and also unlocks alternate outfits for both her and Colt to use throughout the game. I also like that you can change Julianna's invasions to Single Player to play against AI if you'd rather not bet on the challenge of random players cutting your run short. You can even set it on Friends Only to limit Julianna appearances to your trusted buddies. That last one is a very lovely touch.I’d like to say Deathloop is perfect, but I can’t. It’s not without some quirks, and some nasty ones at that. At the very worst, I had the game crash on me a few times – notably, once when I was loading in to play as Julianna and once as I initiated a firefight with unsuspecting enemies on the first shot. It just booted me out to the dashboard and I had to restart from whatever stage of the day I was at, leading to some lengthy lost exploration in one case. I can confirm from other sources that PC also experienced some crashes in similar manners. The game has some glitches, too. There were a few times where I caught enemies stuck in their own mini loops of animation, running at doors and never opening them. There were also occasional graphical glitches like smoke textures artifacting in ways that didn’t seem purposeful. These weren’t by any means frequent or jarring enough to break the game, but they do keep it from being absolutely untarnished.There are so many things I love about Deathloop it’s hard to limit myself in gushing about it. It’s not just some of the best design I’ve seen out of one of my favorite studios, Arkane has also incorporated fun elements from games like Dark Souls and Hitman into Deathloop to make it altogether its own deliciously unique offering. AI can bumble a bit and the cost of failure can be high, but Deathloop still delivers a visceral and engaging murder puzzle that demands thorough investigation and gritty gunplay down to its final twists and turns. Colt and Julianna’s rivalry keeps the tension and stakes high and it’s a loop I’ll be going back to over and over again, whether to break it or break other players for trying to break it.This review is based on a digital PS5 version supplied by the publisher.

Deathloop,Alex Donaldson,VG247,https://www.vg247.com/deathloop-review-a-thrilling-slick-adventure-and-arkanes-best-game-yet,"By refining the studio’s strong suits and introducing a killer new gimmick, Deathloop is Arkane’s finest game yet, and one of the best games of the year.At the heart of Deathloop in both narrative and video game terms is the titular loop. One might argue that Arkane Studios has embraced something of a loop itself, too. There’s a certain type of game they make, a certain feel that ties together Dishonored, Prey, and now Deathloop. Like this game’s lead, Arkane has forged a new path with a canny combination of repetition and experimentation; repeating and refining many of the mechanics and ideas that made their past games great, while introducing new concepts that serve to elevate the game as a whole.Like I said, chief among those mechanics is the loop. The island of Blackreef has been trapped inside a repeating daily cycle - and so regardless of if you die or survive the course of the day, you’ll wake up back in the same spot on the same morning. In the single-player narrative, protagonist Colt Vahn’s mission is to break the loop - which can only be done by committing a specific set of murders. Your targets are often well-fortified and protected, and thus reaching them will require a bunch of knowledge that, at the game’s onset, Colt doesn’t have.Deathloop is built around this basic conceit. You’ll have leads on intelligence, new weapons, and ways to assassinate your targets - and though it’s impossible to tackle every lead at once, Colt and his rival assassin, Juliana, keep their knowledge between loops, while everyone else forgets. In some ways the way you approach this is linear - you get a bunch of information throughout a day that’ll allow you to do something specific in the next loop. In other ways it’s more open-ended, where you’re basically unlocking shortcuts - a passcode to a door learned in one loop will be remembered and can be used next time, and so on. Given the proximity of the two releases, it’s difficult for me to talk about the time loop-driven information gathering of Deathloop without also thinking about the recently released Twelve Minutes - a game that uses the same trick. Twelve Minutes has come in for a lot of criticism for a lot of very valid reasons, but the way it doled out information and encouraged the player to use their knowledge from past loops to advance was one of the best things about the game. Deathloop has that - but just does it all better.Time on Blackreef is split into a few different slices - Morning, Noon, Afternoon, and Evening. Rather than an in-game clock slowly advancing, each of the island’s zones has a unique world state at each time of day, meaning you get four ‘attempts’ at one of the island’s zones each in-game day. Depending on what time it is, people will be doing different things, areas will be locked or unlocked, and certain major events will be either in preparation or ongoing. Because you have to complete a specific set of objectives in order to break the loop, there’s also a scheduling puzzle element, too - to succeed, you need to figure out a schedule that’ll let you do everything you need to do in one day. On top of this, you have to juggle your equipment and abilities between loops. While Colt keeps his knowledge from one loop to the next, the only way you can keep gear and abilities is through ‘Infusion’, a process that binds items to you and ensures you respawn with them when time loops due to death or the end of the day. Infusion costs a resource you collect while exploring and fighting - and there’s never quite enough, forcing difficult calls.It’s challenging to explain how potent all of this is, and how cleverly it slots together with the school of design Arkane is so proficient at wielding. Gone is the skill tree, replaced with the more organic action of picking things up and facing agonizing decisions of what to infuse and keep for future loops. One type of skill, Slabs, are what I’d call the prototypical Arkane abilities. There’s one that’s basically just like Dishonored’s ‘Blink’ ability, for instance.These only drop from the boss characters, and are expensive as hell to infuse and keep. Multiple times I found myself pained as I decided between different Slabs, as each is uniquely useful.Then there’s how the concept of the loop interacts with the story. Those classic immersive sim touches - audio files, notes, computer terminal chat logs - they’re no longer just world building, but often vital pieces of information that can be used in the next loop. Even idle overheard chatter between the grunt enemies peppered across the island can hold important clues - and it’s a genius way to ensnare the interest of even those players who wouldn’t naturally fully engage with Deathloop’s excellently written narrative.Arkane is known for being pretty damn good at story stuff, and Deathloop is no exception. I think what’s most impressive about it is that there’s a well-developed cast of characters here - not just Colt and Juliana, the duelling assassins featured prominently in marketing, but also the other core characters that make up the architects and targets of Blackreef. These are the sorts of characters that are probably going to launch an avalanche of fan cosplay, art, and fiction. In-game, you mostly get to know them by hearing them on intercoms and skulking through their lairs, reading instant messaging logs and scribbled notes. To a degree, some of this feels a little like the best of BioShock - but focused on a fun, pulpy, tongue-in-cheek universe more than any navel-gazing philosophy. You’re prodded to play as Colt first, to see and experience the story of Deathloop. You can do this on or offline, and regardless of which, your game can occasionally be ‘invaded’ by an AI or human-controlled Juliana that’ll work to hunt you down. As Colt, you’re faced with a choice when Juliana appears. If you don’t want to engage her, a character with equal abilities to yours, you can flee the zone, advancing time and missing whatever you were in that area at that time of day to do. If you stand and fight, it’ll be one of the hardest encounters but will give up awesome rewards. The invasion stuff is a cool little wrinkle when playing the story, but the real fun comes when you’re on the other side. After familiarizing yourself with Blackreef you can take on the role of Juliana and invade other people’s games. Some of Deathloop’s earlier marketing might’ve given the impression that this competitive online element was the core of the game, that it’s a title with a multiplayer focus. It isn’t; it’s a single-player adventure first. But the ability to play as Juliana and invade others is a super satisfying way to see this world from another perspective, giving you a reason to keep playing. Ruining another person’s day is pretty fun, too.The reason you’d want to keep playing is pretty damn simple, too: Deathloop feels bloody fabulous. It’s a tight-yet-slick game, with the options at your disposal at any given time all feeling equally viable - and crucially, equally fun. There’s none of that mismatch often in games like this where going guns blazing doesn’t feel quite right due to how the weapons handle, or where stealth is clunky and frustrating. Everything feels smooth and satisfying, from hacking doors and turrets to all-out gunfights, rapid parkour traversal to crouch-walking your way through a building while racking up stealth takedowns. When things go wrong, it’s easy to quickly switch approaches and pull out a big, loud gun.The game does seem to want you to play stealthy, though - psychedelic notes from Colt’s alternate dimension selves often caution you “maybe don’t go loud” before entering enemy strongholds and the like - but guns blazing is totally an option if that’s what you desire. The weapons, upgrades (known here as trinkets) and slabs you choose to infuse to keep across loops will help to create a character build that’ll let you lean into a specific play-style.I do have the odd criticism, of course. For example, with how important to the narrative and Colt’s knowledge various scattered items are, it’s frustrating that a readable crumpled-up note can have the same item model as one that’s unreadable, unrelated background clutter. I sometimes think the enemy AI is a little too quick to spot you from stealth - though certain slabs can remedy that. One of the guns included in the Digital Deluxe Edition is very good early on and felt a bit like cheating. I reviewed it on PS5, and I found the fine adjustments of aiming on a controller when trying to long-range headshot people in stealth to be fiddly thanks to low sensitivity - I can’t wait to start playing it on PC. These are all small critiques, of course. Certainly nothing game-breaking or earth-shattering. Taken as a single-player experience, Deathloop feels complete and incredibly well-rounded. The extra injection of optional multiplayer action is a fabulous cherry on top. Basically, Deathloop is everything I wanted it to be. It’s confident both as a successor to many of the ideas of Dishonored while also expressly its own thing, with a tone and sense of style I absolutely adore. It’s one of my favourite games of the year - and one we’ll surely be talking about for months to come. You're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!

If you're looking for a simple back-of-box quote about how Bethesda's newest video game works, you won't get one. The list of inspirations in Deathloop, out this week on PS5 and PC, is long: the time-loop conceit of Zelda: Majora's Mask; the multiroute sneak-and-sleuth genius of Dishonored; the aesthetics and trippiness of We Happy Few; and Metroid Prime's mix of backtracking and clue-hunting.What a mouthful! Deathloop is certainly more ambitious than yet another generic shooter, which I appreciate. The studio behind it (Arkane Lyon, creators of Dishonored) can't be faulted for not playing it safe. But ambition alone isn't enough.You may very well enjoy Deathloop's big swings—and at their best, they combine into something special. But there's no denying the sloppiness players have to wade through to find the good stuff. Even though its core is compelling, Deathloop simply doesn't feel finished. Instead, it seems unpolished, like it was rushed out the door. And its die-and-retry gimmick doesn't make up for a confusing lack of world building or an egregiously small gameplay universe.Imagine waking up as a full-blown amnesiac inside the world of a complicated video game—that's how Deathloop starts. The game forgoes any introduction or stage-setting cut scenes. Fade from black, and the game's hero, Colt (you, in first-person perspective), screams in confusion as he is assaulted with knife stabs and F-bombs by Julianna, the game's constant antagonist. Moments later, another version of Colt shows up and saves you from a life-ending fall off a cliff. Then he drops you anyway.You wake up after this brutal end at the exact same place and time, thus confirming the ""deathloop"" in the game's name. All of your inventory is gone. But this time, at least, your consciousness is retaining memories. No more amnesia. The first thing you remember is a password to open a critical door. From here, you set out to accumulate knowledge and break this time loop. No one clarifies why Julianna keeps trying to kill you or why everyone on this time-bent island doesn't just chill out and enjoy being able to survive death over and over again.Every time you rewind from death, different things pop up on the beach where you wake: a gun, a hacking device (to unlock doors and remotely disable turrets), a ""shard"" that enables a special ability, and a ""trinket"" that buffs up one of your weapons. After the first few hours of gameplay, you'll learn how to ""bind"" more weapons, shards, and trinkets to your consciousness. That way, they appear on the beach with you every morning, which is useful for the more dangerous scenarios ahead.Shards are the most Dishonored-like part of your loadout, since they enable magical abilities. Some are rote, like a double-jump (the starting default) and a midair dash. Others are wild, such as Karnesis, which lets you throw enemies' bodies around, and Nexus, which lets you drop a temporary cloud near a crowd of enemies. Hit any enemy in this cloud with an attack, and all the others nearby will feel it. Nexus is a fun way to clear out a cluster of foes who might block your preferred sneaking path.After about two hours of playtime in Deathloop, you figure out how to break the time loop and escape: Colt must kill all eight ""Visionaries"" on Blackreef Island. Crucially, he must kill all of them in a single day, which requires getting your daily murder planner down pat. Each day is split into four chunks (dawn, noon, dusk, and evening), and the island itself is broken up into four discrete regions. This isn't a roguelike; the world is static, so its buildings, objectives, and events are consistent. But its events run on a schedule, the same every loop, which makes a place different at dusk than it is at any other time of day.As an example, you can explore the Updaam district as long as you want with no timer counting down—so long as you get there at dawn. As soon as you leave Updaam, the day moves about four hours ahead. Before you leave, you may stumble upon a clue in Updaam that tells you to come back at dusk. That's when a specific event will unfold that you can interrupt to, say, kill a Visionary or pick up a useful item. But, gosh, I need to go elsewhere at dusk to finish another mission. You know what they say: Why do today what you can delay for the next, uh, time loop?You die every time you run out the day by leaving an island portion during the ""evening"" slot. After that, you wake up anew on the aforementioned beach at dawn, equipped with new bundles of intel and newly ""bound"" weapons and items to do it all over again, looping once more from dawn to midnight. Eventually, you'll gather the knowledge and items necessary to chain together the perfect full-day itinerary, bouncing to the right parts of the island at the right time of day to kill all eight Visionaries.In good news, Deathloop mostly does a tidy job of tracking the hints and intel you pick up as you explore each corner of the island. Pick through a veritable corkboard of clues to narrow down any hints and outright objectives, then use menu toggles to stick them to your preferred time of day or island region. Usually, you can chain together something useful to do at each time of day, which is good because you'll accumulate ""Residuum"" points through the course of a full day—and you'll need these points to permanently bind any nifty new items you find to your future loops. If you'd rather skip straight to one time of day, then start the whole day over after finishing a murderous errand. That's easy to do, too.Sounds intriguing, right? Well, that's only because I was talking you through it.Deathloop's opening is so obsessed with creating attitude and confusion that it fails as a gameplay introduction. Hints of each Visionary litter the island before you have any idea who they are, how many there are, or what their deal is. And you'd think the blocks of text that Colt sees over walls or in hallways would be useful. But no—they're either head-smackingly obvious tips (""go underground"") or portentous nonsense (""Death died here,"" ""They've got no idea, no idea at all"").The constant chatter between Julianna and Colt over a radio system is equally useless. Mostly our two narrators are just trying to see who can swear more. Because Julianna has no interest in helping Colt, she uses the bulk of her air time to taunt and confuse him—but guess what, Arkane? Colt isn't a real person. Deathloop's players are. And your narrative approach does them no favors.To piece together the game's cast, players must paw through notes, diaries, computer terminals, and audio logs, much like in Fallout and BioShock. But without any early anchor for how Deathloop's island functions or how characters relate to each other, it takes a long time before any of this content begins to click. This wouldn't be so bad if the game's buildings, posters, statues, or hallucinatory texts delivered their own storytelling—maybe which Visionary lives where, what their belief system is, and how each cast member interacts with the others. Instead, the game's visual design focuses mostly on how outlandish the Visionaries are or how Colt is an intruder who needs to be stopped.Deathloop's missions eventually string together a vague story of the Visionaries' crisscrossing relationships. Clearly, someone at Arkane tried building a cohesive world where these characters grapple with the high-concept weirdness that keeps the islanders not only trapped in a time loop but also able to interact with clones of themselves. When it's good, it's classic, Bethesda-at-its-best storytelling. There are a few moments where Deathloop's plot shines in unique, only-in-games ways—especially when you sneak up on certain characters talking to clones of themselves. But such highs only make Deathloop's general plot failures all the more disappointing.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

Deathloop,Chris White,God is a Geek,https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/deathloop-review/,"September 14, 2021It’s important for me to try and formulate my opinions on Deathloop in a calm and concise manner. Doing so will allow you to understand my feelings on it in a respectable way without a lack of professionalism. The problem is, that won’t be possible. I’ve got so many thoughts swimming around my brain that I don’t even know where to start. Fundamentally, playing Deathloop has been the most fun I’ve had all year. It’s ridiculous; front-to-back; over-the-top; chaotic. There is a formula, but it’s trapped inside the joyous beast that it is. Fuck it, here it goes.CHECK THIS OUT: The Artful Escape features a thrilling adventure through the cosmosThe island of Blackreef is caught in a timeloop, and for the main single-player campaign, you play as a Colt. A guy without a recollection of the day before. He’s the perfect mirror image of the player, both confused and unaware of what’s happening. You’re told that 8 visionaries need killing to break the timeloop. How you do that is up to you. It takes some time to understand how Deathloop works, but that moment it clicks – my god. Don’t feel stupid if all the menus and discoveries don’t automatically make sense. They didn’t for me. There’s a hell of a lot to get your head around, but the rewards for your patience more than make up for it.Blackreef is split up into four semi-open world areas: The Complex, Updaam, Karl’s Bay, and Fristad Rock. You’re free to explore them as much as you want, at various times in the day. Depending on the time, be it morning, noon, afternoon, or evening, each area feels different. The visionaries you must kill are located across all the areas, and by journeying through them across the day, new clues can be found that’ll help the eventual demise of each one. Before each trip out, you can check Arsenal Leads and Visionary Leads to see what needs doing based on the progression you’ve made.It is these leads where your objectives appear. There is somewhat of a campaign structure, however, the freedom is where the enjoyment lies. Freeing your mind of all that formulaic mission progression you’re used to allows you to enjoy Deathloop more. I found it uncomfortable not knowing what was next, or where I should be going after my current objective. All that matters is killing the visionaries multiple times, across different times of the day. Embrace how disjointed it is and I promise you you’ll have more fun than you’ve had in years.Once killed, each of the Visionaries provide you with something very special. It could be a powerful weapon or a unique ability called a slab that will help you further down the line. Shift will let you teleport; Karnesis launches enemies in the air; Aether turns you invisible; Nexus links enemy brains together so by killing one will kill them all; and Havoc sends you in a rage. Each can be upgraded, too. For example, the more you kill a Visionary, the more times that particular ability can be improved. Upgrading Shift allows you to freeze mid-jump to teleport to the ground, and improving Karnesis holds enemies mid-air. They’re so cool, and drastically improve your whole approach every time.You can also find items called trinkets. These buffs and skills fall under two categories: character and weapon. Character trinkets give you certain skills like longer sliding, double jumping, or improved damage up close. Weapon trinkets can improve the weapon they’re allocated to in a number of ways as well. They look like little disks that’ll fall from regular enemies and Visionaries, and come in different levels shown by their colour (grey, blue, green, and purple).New weapons call also be unlocked. The Strelak 50-50 can be transformed from one quickfire pistol into an SMG, and the Tribunal feels like the spiritual successor to the Golden Gun from GoldenEye on the N64. Having a collection of great weapons compliment the superpowers and improve your chances of survival in each playthrough. You also get a Hackamajig that hacks turrets and security sensors, as well as creates distractions for you to slip past undetected. All of these powers and weapons are fantastic, but unless you learn to Infuse them, you’ll have to go through the rigmarole of finding them all over again.Deathloop isn’t just a cool title. During your run, you get three chances to kill a Visionary, find a cool weapon, or explore the location. If you die, you are sent back a few hundred yards and are allowed to continue. Die again, and this happens a final time. However, if you die for a third time, everything you’ve gained is lost until you do it all over again. If you survive and complete your own personal objectives, you can escape into the tunnels and exit to the menus. By doing so, the time jumps to the next part of the day. If you get to the end of the day, regardless of surviving the morning, noon, afternoon, and evening, you can still lose everything.Infusing is a massive mechanic in Deathloop. After killing one of the Visionaries called Wenji, you are able to harvest something known as Residuum. Certain items located across Blackreef glow a pink and green colour (think petrol in water). Also, dead Visionaries provide a lot of Residuum, as do the corpses of Colt. Once you return to the planning menu, you can use this Residuum to Infuse slabs, weapons, character and weapon trinkets. By doing this, they’ll be available for every loop going forward. This means they won’t be lost, and you can equip them without the fear of losing them upon death.With all the weapons, trinkets, and slabs, Deathloop becomes an awesome game to play, but the foundations are solid to begin with. Movement is smooth, with parkour elements easy to get to grips with. Shooting, reloading, and sliding all feel natural. Thanks to the basics being so good, all the fun stuff falls nicely into place. When you begin to feel like a god, the gameplay is magical. It shares a welcome resemblance to Dying Light, and I am all for that. Trying to break the loop as Colt is one of the best experiences I’ve had all year.Along with the single-player stuff, there’s also a multiplayer element that lets you play as Julianna. Her role is to protect the loop, and by jumping into friend’s or stranger’s loops, you get a slightly different experience to what you’re used to. Seeing that fateful message pop up telling you Julianna is in your game puts you on edge. Sometimes you don’t mind it and are up for the challenge. Other times – particularly when you’re trying to get something specific done – it’s a pain in the ass. Obviously, you don’t have to play online, and this feature can be turned off. As Colt it can be annoying, but if you are playing as Julianna, it’s great.CHECK THIS OUT: We chat Tales of Arise, Lost in Random, and WarioWare on the latest podcastYou earn Hunter points which turn into upgrades, new slabs, and weapons. Unless Colt destroys the satellites so he can escape, he’s trapped. This means you can set up watch close by the satellite and wait for him to arrive. Unless you have a decent loadout, Julianna will more often that not execute you sharpish. If you’re packing serious heat and abilities, it’ll be much more exciting. It has some serious legs for those that have done as much as they can or want to with Colt. One of the best features about her appearance is that if you kill her, you might be able to find a slab or one of its upgrades, meaning you don’t even have to kill the Visionary associated with it.I feel as though I’ve rambled enough about how great Deathloop is. It never takes itself too seriously. The voice actors for Colt and Julianna are magnificent. So too are the weird and wonderful Visionaries. If I had one negative, it would be the AI is pretty dumb. Stealth is far too easy, and they’re not always aware of you, even if you’re in their peripheral. Other than that, Deathloop is easily one of the best games of 2021, and there’s a reason Bethesda has been promoting it as much as they have.Incredible abilities
Satisfying gameplay
Tons of replayability
Great voice acting
Multiplayer mode is a neat add-onAi isn't greatDeathloop is a magnificently unstructured FPS filled with loads of weapons and abilities that never stops being fun.

Deathloop,Diego Perez,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/deathloop-review/,"There sure have been a lot of time loop games recently, huh? This year alone we’ve gotten 12 Minutes, The Forgotten City, Returnal, and now Deathloop. It feels like we’ve been seeing Deathloop trailers for forever at this point, but now that the game is in our hands, how does it hold up? Deathloop has that Arkane flair that everyone was expecting it to have, but the studio really went above and beyond with this game.Deathloop is a first-person shooter from Arkane Studios, the developer behind the acclaimed Dishonored series. You play as Colt, a man stuck in a time loop on a mysterious island called Blackreef. The only chance Colt has of breaking the loop is to kill eight specific targets called Visionaries before the day ends and everything starts all over from the beginning. It’s a lot more complicated than it sounds, especially because he’s also being hunted by a rival assassin named Julianna the whole time. Solving this murder puzzle is the core of Deathloop, but it isn’t as simple as running and gunning through Blackreef until you find the right people.Because of the whole time loop thing, you can only visit so many places during the day. Each loop is split into four parts: morning, noon, afternoon, and evening. That means you can only go on four missions each day. With four missions and eight targets, you’re going to have to get creative with your approach. You also get three lives during a loop, after which you’ll be sent back to the beginning of the day. Revisiting areas, learning schedules, and discovering new information are key to solving the puzzle.There are only four playable locations on Blackreef, but they change depending on the time of day you visit them. This is the most interesting piece of the puzzle. Places feel very different in the morning versus the evening, and taking care of something earlier in the day can have ripple effects throughout the rest of the loop. For example, one of the Visionaries throws a party every evening in a region called Updaam. Some of the other Visionaries are too busy to attend, unless Colt frees up their schedules by sabotaging their work earlier in the day. Little things like that can cause multiple Visionaries to end up in the same place at the same time, bringing you one step closer to killing all eight in a single loop.Of course, all four locations feel unique because of Arkane’s level design prowess. These are the Dishonored devs, and it really shows. Updaam is the most Dishonored-like level with windows to climb through and rooftops to sneak across, but all four levels are a joy to explore. You can really see a lot of Dishonored’s DNA in Deathloop, but it still feels fresh thanks to its unique style. The decision to make each level smaller but with different variations depending on the time of day is brilliant. There’s no wasted space, and you can get familiar with layouts and shortcuts very quickly.You’re not going to break the loop on your first try, but you don’t have to start fresh every day either. You can carry over weapons and abilities between loops by infusing them with a currency called Residuum. You can harvest Residuum from certain items found throughout levels, but most of your Residuum is going to come from slain Visionaries. At the end of a loop, you can spend whatever Residuum you have to permanently add something to your arsenal. The game isn’t stingy with Residuum and you can find some pretty great weapons early in the game, so I had a solid range of weapons and powers at my disposal after just a few loops.While I went into Deathloop expecting top-notch level design and a beautiful world to explore, I wasn’t expecting to be hooked by its story and characters. Discovering the truth of the time loop and learning more about the Visionaries is interesting, but Colt and Julianna are the heart of the story. They have a much friendlier rivalry than I was expecting. Even though Julianna is constantly trying to kill Colt, the two are really playful and flirty with each other. They recognize that the stakes aren’t really that high since death just means they get to do this all over again tomorrow, so they have some fun with it.Julianna is much more present in the story than I thought she would be too. She calls Colt at the start of every level and will comment on your actions when you reach certain parts of the story. Most of the time she’ll just tease Colt, but other times she’ll casually drop really important plot-relevant information on a whim. She’s a fascinating character, and learning more about the dynamic between her and Colt is easily one of the best things about Deathloop.Julianna is also part of the game’s most interesting mechanic: invasions. Julianna can appear at any point during a loop to try and kill you, but she can be controlled by another player if you’re playing online. When she appears, Colt is unable to leave the area until he hacks a special device, trapping the pair in a cage match. The game doesn’t tell you where either player is, so it’s a tense game of cat and mouse. Julianna typically won’t end your run because the odds are skewed in Colt’s favor because he has three lives and she has one, but she can absolutely screw up your plans.I thought PvP invasions would ruin the experience, but they’re actually one of the best parts of Deathloop. They really make you appreciate Arkane’s brilliant level design even more, because each location not only has to function as an interesting single-player level, but also a somewhat balanced PvP arena as well. Also, both stealth and action are viable options for dealing with invaders. If you’re a stealthy player, you can just sneak over and hack the device, finish up your objective, and then leave without being seen. If you’re going in guns blazing, then you can take Julianna head-on. Invasions don’t feel tacked on. Instead, the whole game feels designed around them.Playing as Julianna is a ton of fun, too. I only expected to do one or two invasions to test out the PvP for the purposes of this review, but I ended up sitting there for hours killing as many Colts as I could. I felt rewarded for all the time I put into single-player because I knew all the routes and objective locations to search. Every player plays differently because the game allows for so many different playstyles, so no two invasions feel the same. Do you place mines in a shortcut that you know most people will probably take? Do you wait on a rooftop with a sniper rifle until Colt walks into your crosshairs? Do you just run at him with a shotgun? There’s a ton of depth to Deathloop’s PvP mode, and I can’t wait to see the plans people come up with as Julianna.Deathloop is just an all-around amazing game. The level design is great, as expected, but Arkane has really improved upon its formula in every way with this game. Whether you want to play this as a stealth game like Dishonored, play an action-packed first-person shooter, or just want to experience a great story, then Deathloop will accommodate you. Deathloop takes Arkane’s fantastic level design and world-building and adds an interesting story with great characters on top, leaving you in a time loop that you won’t want to break.

Deathloop,Josh Wise,VideoGamer,https://www.videogamer.com/reviews/deathloop-review/," Posted in Reviews
EDITOR’S UPDATE (20th September 2022): Deathloop has now launched for the Xbox Series X|S. While it has some new additions in the form of the Goldenloop update, it’s largely the same game.Therefore, we’re republishing our original review of the game – played on the PlayStation 5 in 2021.The Isle of Blackreef is hardly holiday-worthy. It is scraped by polar winds, and a miserable sea moans against its coasts. Inland, there is a small town called Updaam, with a few sights worth taking in, but you could do it in a day. Then again, in Blackreef a day is all anyone has. Looming on the horizon is a vast ring of steel, as though one of the Halos from Halo had crash-landed. In its centre is a vibrating metal sphere, and, like a jet engine, it seems to suck in the hours and blast them backwards, to be lived again. For some, this means a frozen paradise—a chance to bask in the heat of a debauched party that will never thaw. For our hero, Colt Vahn, who feels his soul being refrigerated by eternity, it means Hell.At the outset, Colt wakes on the shore after being impaled on the blade of a woman named Julianna. The two have history, a full day of it, and Julianna recalls everything, whereas Colt is beached in a memoryless fog. She ran him through because he was trying to break the loop. “Why do you even like this place?!” he asks her. “Because it’s amazing!” she says. “It’s the only amazing place in an entire world of shit. You’ll see it, eventually.” This is the crux of Deathloop, from developer Arkane Studios, whose games often centre on amazing places in entire worlds of shit. In Dishonored there was Dunwall, a grey rat-run of disagreeable streets, its furnaces stoked by whale oil. In Prey there was Talos I, a retro space station of brass and glass, like an Art Deco building caught in the lunar pull. Playing those games, as with Deathloop, you sense the ruin of wider worlds eating at the edges like rust.Arkane’s goal, with these adventures, has been to convert people from Colts into Juliannas: to get them to play a series of enclosed sandboxes over and over, trowelling up the secrets ingrained within, until they grow to love the place. “What’s so amazing about that?” you might ask. To which the Arkane-addicted would reply, “You’ll see it, eventually.” Deathloop, then, is less a departure in its structure than it is the ultimate manifestation of the studio’s time-proof approach. Ironically, it is also, in its embrace of all-out action (your efforts are liberally flowered with the bloom of fireballs), more likely to attract those who would sooner breeze and blast their way through. To gain, as it were, a Colt following.Not that stealth is off the table. On the contrary, I spent much of the action crouched and sleuthing, aided by a clutch of Slabs—floating doodads that impart supernatural powers. One of these allows Colt to shield his body in a purplish shimmer, rendering himself invisible. Another lets him tether his enemies’ fates together, so that shooting one in the head, for example, will kill several simultaneously. (When they die, your foes ripple away into a rainbow mist and melt on the air; the same thing happened in Control, and the purpose there was as it is here: to remedy your guilt.) There is a nice leaning manoeuvre, where Colt cranes his neck above cover without alerting anyone—useful for hacking turrets and cameras from safety, and turning them against their masters. Only, I wonder if waking up on the sand every morning is doing his back any good, because he would sometimes jerk out of cover mid-peek, as if he had slipped a disc.Should you opt to treat Deathloop as a straight first-person shooter, you will find it richly rewarding. The game comes to PlayStation 5 and PC, and, if you have the choice, go for the PlayStation version. Arkane has filled the controller with sensations, including, strange to report, nails; note the tinkling as Colt sprinkles a handful of them into the hissing chamber of a nail gun, followed by the gassy pop of the trigger as you fire one at an adversary. Shotguns feel like a deep, lung-clearing cough, hawking up buckshot at anyone in its wide spread. As with Returnal, basic movement is boosted with haptics, so you get a heightened physicality, as each footfall stamps your palms with texture. And Julianna, as she taunts and teases Colt over the radio, crackles through the controller’s speaker. In a delicious touch, Julianna will appear, often at the most inopportune times, and kill you, as she says, “in increasingly violent ways.” This suggests that she shares at least some DNA with the beast cooked up by Creative Assembly for Alien: Isolation. True, she possesses no writhing tail, and her presence isn’t foretold by trails of drool; nevertheless, she prowls relentlessly after you, and her sarcasm is matched only by her hostility. She is A.I.-driven, but, should you so wish, you can make your single-player game invadable, and your friends can try and stymie your progress, or vice versa. Playing as Julianna is a kick; she can swap guises with N.P.Cs, laying a trap for some poor human-piloted Colt, before closing in for the ambush. There are better miniature stories winding through moments like these than there are in the main narrative.The plot concerns a group called the Visionaries: eight people, movers and shakers, whose mission is to keep Blackreef from moving at all, even as it shakes the island to its foundations. (Periodically, the enormous hoop lets out a concussive pulse that shudders over the land.) Killing them isn’t too difficult, but the catch is that Colt must dispatch them all in a single day to shatter the loop; thus, his task is one of reconnaissance, of working out, say, that two of his targets like to elope each lunchtime, canoodling right into his crosshairs as a pair. Information is cached within letters and computers, and you follow your leads on a map, which swells like a storm of push-pins and tape. In planning your next move, you can fast forward, and each district changes—crowds thinning, doors unlocking, security defences raising and lowering like the tide.After each run, you can imbue your weapons and items with Residuum, a substance that carries them through each loop, so that you begin with your chosen gear intact. You also notice the mounting impression, at each sunrise, of a bigger picture falling into place. I was reminded, as the details clicked together, of The Sexy Brutale—a puzzler about a priest lodged in a temporal skip, solving a spree of murders. That game was also locked in a single location—a mansion-bound party, no less—and it fell to you to prevent each death: a wondrous and rare example of the whendunnit. Deathloop, on the other hand, is the reverse; Colt’s operation is low on spiritual virtue and high on brutale.More than felling each Visionary, however, and piecing together the history of Blackreef, I relished uncovering more about Colt. He is a warm hero, grouchy and gruff, and, though he works out his bearings early on (“I’m a drinker. Occasionally a drunk. Man about island. Everyone knows me. Everyone hates me. Handy with a gun. Quick with a joke”), there remains something elusive about him. “You seem to know what you want without knowing what you want,” one character remarks, and it’s true; Colt is urged on by nothing more than an urge, an inkling that all is not right—that mortal coils are made to be shuffled off. In turn, I was urged on less by a slow-dawning sense that no one lives forever and more by the fond memory of No One Lives Forever, the spy-flavoured sixties shooter, from Monolith Productions, which was as handy with a gun as it was quick with a joke.The humour in Deathloop is spiked with backchat, rather than all-out spoof, but the aesthetics are similar. I quickly became obsessed with the bulging televisions, encased in bright-coloured plastic, and the rotary dial telephones. One villain’s base would make Frank Lloyd Wright swoon, jutting squarely over a cliff on stark-white pillars. The stylised cutscenes wedged between levels are shaded like Saul Bass title sequences, and the music (by Tom Salta and Ross Tregenza) is tinged with a Bondian twang. I can only guess that Sébastien Mitton, the game’s art director, went about his brief with a desire to conjure a fever of Fleming-style espionage, while grounding it in bleakness and splicing it with sci-fi. The result is a world of swinging thrills that is never far from darkness—where you don’t only live twice, and where tomorrow always dies.Indeed, there is much of Ken Adam (the production designer behind many of the early Bond movies) here, not just in the elaborate sets—which are happily haunted by his love of rockets, wall-size computers, and modernist interior decor—but in what we might call surface tension: the gap between the quivering cardboard of the design and the weight of real meaning. If there is something lacking in Deathloop, it has to do with emotional staying power. As one egghead, in a scratchy projector film, began to unreel the mythology (“Long ago, the isle of Blackreef experienced a cataclysmic event which tore the fabric of”—and so forth), I realised that I couldn’t care less. Blackreef can go hang. I suspect that the only things that will stick with me—the only things coated with enough Residuum to survive a hard reset—are Colt and Julianna. And maybe that isn’t all bad news. I may replay it at some point, and when I do I’ll be even more like Colt, waking on a beach with the vague prickle of familiarity, and the need to break free.Developer: Arkane StudiosPublisher: Bethesda SoftworksAvailable on: PlayStation 5 [reviewed on], Xbox Series X|S, PCRelease Date: September 14, 2021To check what a review score means from us, click here.

Deathloop,Jeff Grubb,GamesBeat,https://venturebeat.com/2021/09/13/deathloop-review-in-progress-arkane-lyon-at-the-top-of-its-game/,"Connect with top gaming leaders in Los Angeles at GamesBeat Summit 2023 this May 22-23. Register here.Deathloop is one of the best games of the year. And I say that as someone who has previously recognized the quality of Arkane games while struggling to enjoy them. But with this game, French team Arkane Lyon used some smart tricks to amplify its strengths. And the result is a special experience that has broader appeal than some other Arkane projects.Deathloop is available September 14 for $60 on PC and PlayStation 5. I played on PS5, where it ran well and without issues. I cannot speak to its stability or performance on PC yet.At its core, Deathloop is similar to Arkane’s 2017 Prey or either of the Dishonored games. You have firearms and melee weapons for combat as well as special powers (called slabs here) that can augment your offense or your ability to stealth around enemies.Where the action diverts is in the structure. Unlike Dishonored or Prey, where you make steady ongoing linear progress, Deathloop employs a time-looping mechanic. This means that every day is the same as the last. And while the specifics of how that work are a bit complicated, what’s important here is that the loop enables Arkane’s gameplay to shine.GamesBeat Summit 2023Join the GamesBeat community in Los Angeles this May 22-23. You’ll hear from the brightest minds within the gaming industry to share their updates on the latest developments.Above: Deathloop in action.Let me get this out of the way. Deathloop is not a roguelite like Hades or Returnal. While you are playing in the same areas time after time, procedural generation has no role here.Additionally, as the hero Colt, one of the main ways you progress through the game is by following leads and unlocking knowledge about the world. And that specific flow feels linear, and you are likely going to make significant progress toward those goals through every in-game day. This is not an experience about good or bad runs.Instead, from a mechanical perspective, the time loop exists to build intimacy between the player and the world. And it turns out this is crucial in an Arkane game.Above: Remember to kick.One of the reasons I often bounce off of Arkane’s titles and other immersive sims is because they make me feel dimwitted. When I first go through a stage or an encounter, I often bumble through them just trying to survive. And if an interesting idea about how to use a shortcut or a power occurs to me later, well, I usually am too frustrated with myself to go back and play the level over again.With Deathloop, however, you’re almost supposed to bumble through your first few times traveling the game’s four main areas. Colt starts the game hungover on a beach with no memories, and it makes sense that he is struggling to find his footing.But then, thanks to the time loop, you begin to build a relationship with the maps. And now, if an idea occurs to me about how to use the Force push-like Karnesis in conjunction with a cliff, well, I’m likely going to be back in that spot again.While the time loop has benefitted me as a player, it’s also something that improved the design of the world and levels.In other immersive sims, every space often has multiple ways in and you just need to play to your character’s strength to find the right one for you. If you have stealth abilities, you’ll have a way to sneak in through tunnels or whatever. But because you will only go through certain areas a couple of times at most, the level designers have to restrain themselves to ensure players don’t get lost or frustrated.In short, a map in an Arkane game is typically a series of obstacles and not necessarily a space worth exploring on its own. In Deathloop, again because of the time-repeating mechanic, Arkane was able to flip that on its head.The four main areas feel much more like worlds to explore. Sure, they have obstacles and alternate paths that you can bypass depending on your equipped powers, but it doesn’t feel like you are simply selecting one of three predefined routes.This makes the levels feel much more interesting, and a huge part of your early runs will come down to looking around for secrets. And the game excels at rewarding that exploration.It’s wonderful to play a game that feels like the developer was considerate of your feelings. And that’s what I get from Deathloop. It’s nice to come to a genre that I’ve wanted to love and to find that one of the best developers in that space wants to welcome in my old, calcified brain.It helps, too, that Deathloop has so much style. That’s true of its visuals and excellent, thumping soundtrack. And like Hades, its story progresses whether you live or die through each loop.I have found the narrative somewhat overwhelming at times — just in terms of the amount of information the game throws at you. But Arkane has accounted for that as well with one of the best mission- and info-tracking systems in a game ever. Even if you failed to pick up on a key piece of intel, the game will tell you what you need to do next as long as you found the key piece of evidence.And the best thing I can say about Deathloop is that it’s all I want to play right now.Deathloop is available September 14 for $60.

Whether it’s Arkane’s best game, on the other hand, depends on what you want out of the experience. Unlike Arkane’s Dishonored series, Deathloop isn’t a demanding stealth game set in a lovingly crafted fantasy world. Instead, it’s a fast-paced, innovative and sometimes messy shooter set in a time loop on a remote northern island in the real world. It’s also unlike any other big-budget game that’s come out this year.The premise of Deathloop is deceptively simple. Amnesiac gunman Colt is trapped in a day-long time loop, hounded by an assassin named Julianna. To break the loop, he needs to defeat Julianna and seven other major enemies, called Visionaries, in a single day. That means he’ll go through the loop again and again, uncovering the secrets of the mysterious Blackreef Island, collecting gear and upgrades, and gunning down a whole lot of cannon fodder enemies who get in his way.It’s easy to admire Deathloop for its creative premise, tight gameplay and interactive story. As the game goes on, however, it’s also easy to see the cracks around the edges — namely repetitive runs, punishing encounters and performance issues. Still, on the whole, Deathloop is a breath of fresh air in a sea of same-y game ideas, and that alone makes it worth checking out. Read on for our full Deathloop review.While Deathloop is a complex game, the core concept is amazingly simple: kill eight bosses in a single run. Of course, simple doesn’t necessarily mean “easy,” as Deathloop gives you a ton of tools at your disposal to accomplish this.You play as Colt: a man who has no memory of his past, save that he’s apparently been hunted (and killed) over and over again by a short-tempered woman named Julianna. Each time Colt dies, he reawakens on a beach on Blackreef Island: a remote scientific outpost that looks like it came out of a ‘60s spy thriller. Colt learns that Blackreef Island is stuck reliving the same day again and again, but that only he and Julianna retain their memories between each iteration. Eight brilliant “Visionaries” maintain the time loop, and killing them all in the same day is the only way to end the cycle.Arkane calls Deathloop a “murder puzzle,” and after your first few runs, you’ll see why. While Deathloop is, at its core, a first-person shooter/stealth game, the structure is more interesting than the moment-to-moment gameplay. Blackreef Island has four explorable districts, and four distinct times of day. Each time you leave a district, time advances.As such, it’s not possible to simply run up to every Visionary, guns blazing, and break the time loop in a single go. Instead, you’ll have to thoroughly investigate each district, at each time of day, looking for clues about how the Visionaries spend their time, and — most importantly — when they get together. How you tackle them is ultimately up to you, whether it’s via open combat, stealth or some kind of ironic, contextual punishment. (That element from Arkane’s Dishonored series is still present, at least.)Deathloop does a fantastic job of giving you just enough information to get you started, then letting you explore the large, detailed levels for yourself. For example: One visionary, a game designer named Charlie, sequesters himself away in a mountain fortress that doubles as a live-action roleplaying game. The game simply tells you where the fortress is. It’s up to you to find a path through the enemy-laden streets, then decide whether to blast your way through the sci-fi-themed game, or take the long way around and unearth hidden entrances as you go. Once you figure out Charlie’s schedule, you can attempt to dispatch him to earn new gear, or you can leave him in peace and reserve your resources for another run. Deathloop’s open-ended design treads a perfect line between “hand-holding” and “aimless.”In terms of gameplay, Deathloop is a bit more action-packed than Dishonored, but a lot of the same DNA is present. You can still crouch and sneak, dispatching some enemies silently and avoiding others entirely. However, this time around, you can also employ a whole arsenal of guns, from high-caliber sniper rifles to rapid-firing machine pistols. Each gun has a rarity level, and some have special abilities; you generally get the best ones from killing the Visionaries.As in Dishonored, you can also equip various trinkets to bolster your abilities (more health, quieter sneaking, etc.) and your weapons (larger magazines, faster reloads, etc.). You can also outfit yourself with special powers that the Visionaries drop upon defeat, from short-range teleportation to tossing enemies around like ragdolls. The powers help streamline the game a lot, and provide a satisfying reason to confront Visionaries over and over, as they can also drop upgrades. An easy-to-earn resource called Residuum lets you keep your favorite weapons, trinkets and abilities as you repeat the loop.While Deathloop’s structure and mechanics make the game compulsively playable for a while, however, your advancement slows down considerably over time. During your first trip through an area, you’ll find clues, unlockable paths and world-building collectibles left and right. As you start to play the same areas over and over, however (and you will have to do this quite a bit), it all starts to feel a little rote.You’ll have to fight the same enemies, in the same places, redoing the same puzzles and collecting the same equipment. This can feel especially punishing on paths with a lot of unavoidable enemies, or when trying to complete objectives that require absolute, unbroken stealth. Having to trudge all the way to the exit and restart the process from scratch is tiresome once, and absolutely exhausting by the fourth or fifth time.It’s also worth mentioning Deathloop’s creative multiplayer mode, in which you take control of Julianna and invade other players’ games. Doing so helps you earn cosmetics for both Julianna and Colt. It’s a creative take on PvP combat, and can create some intense, unexpected firefights. It’s also totally optional, however. You can set your game to “friends-only” invasions, which means you’ll face off only against people you know. Or you can set your game to single-player mode, which pits you against a computer-controlled Julianna.The very first thing you’ll see in Deathloop is a beautiful assassin plunging a machete into your chest and acting as though the whole sordid affair is somehow your fault. It’s kind of unsettling and kind of funny, which is pretty much the tone you can expect from the rest of the game.What works best about Deathloop’s story is just how organically it emerges. There aren’t any long cutscenes to sit through, and you don’t need to hunt down every piece of optional lore to get the full story. You’ll piece together Deathloop’s narrative at your own pace as you meet the Visionaries, track their movements and learn about how they relate to one another. There’s no special order you have to do this in, which means you’ll probably learn a little more about the plot with each new run.The only issue with this approach is that some of the plot points are more impactful than others, and you might wind up unearthing the really juicy stuff early on in the game. Once you know exactly how Blackreef Island’s time loop started and why Julianna wants you dead, the rest of the story feels a bit like mopping up.While Blackreef Island can be a bleak place, Deathloop is a pretty game. Each of the four explorable districts has something unique to offer, from the vivacious city streets of Updaam to the lonely shorelines of Karl’s Bay. The whole game has a slightly cartoonish aesthetic and a powerful ‘60s vibe, replete with minicom computers, retro-futurist rockets and polka dot mini dresses. On a PC, you can crank the settings as high as your machine allows; on a PS5, you can run at dynamic 4K resolution or a steady 60 frames per second.The game’s music and voicework are also stellar, with plenty of ambient tunes and a lot of spirited banter. Jason E. Kelley as Colt and Ozioma Akagha as Julianna really steal the show, however, with frequent back-and-forths that can turn from good-natured to vindictive on a dime. Since the two of them can (and do) kill each other frequently, there’s no impending confrontation hanging over their exchanges. Every conversation has a laid-back, mildly threatening vibe that’s sometimes playful and sometimes laugh-out-loud funny.The only big issue here is that Deathloop is not very stable on PC. The game crashes regularly enough to be an issue, and frequently drops frame rates, even when there’s nothing particularly demanding going on. Bethesda is working on a patch for these issues, but crashes present a real problem, as the game saves only between areas.Play Deathloop long enough, and the shine wears off a bit. A time loop is, by nature, a repetitive event, and the game can’t quite square that with its “make progress in every run” philosophy. Some runs are complete wastes of time, and that’s particularly frustrating when you need to replay a particularly difficult or demanding section.On the other hand, Deathloop takes a creative premise and delivers on it extremely well. There’s a ton to do and see, and you can do it and see it at your own pace, in your own playstyle. The hero and villain share a delightful chemistry, and once you learn the ins and outs of the loop, you’ll start to feel pretty clever.If nothing else, we haven’t seen a game quite like Deathloop before. That alone arguably makes it worth a look.Marshall Honorof is a senior editor for Tom's Guide, overseeing the site's coverage of gaming hardware and software.

And in combining bits and bobs from this unlikely array of sources they’ve managed to come up with a game all its own.Score: 8.0/10  Platform: PlayStation 5Developer: Arkane Lyon Publisher: Bethesda Softworks Release Date: September 14, 2021 ESRB: MSign up to receive the daily top stories from the Financial Post, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.A welcome email is on its way. If you don't see it, please check your junk folder.The next issue of Financial Post Top Stories will soon be in your inbox. We encountered an issue signing you up. Please try again It begins with Colt, an effortlessly cool ’60s-styled killer, waking up in a discombobulated state on the beach of a mysterious island. He soon discovers that this has happened to him before. Endless times. He’s stuck in an infinite time loop in which he keeps experiencing the same day over and over again. It’s the result of a project created by a group of so-called Visionaries who want to create a bizarre utopia in which they can never die and party forever.The problem is, everyone loses their memory of the previous day at the start of the next.Everyone, that is, except Colt and a sharp-witted antagonist named Julianna.Julianna’s goal is to keep the loop going forever, which means doing her best to kill Colt every day. She orders everyone on the island to hunt our hep hero, which makes exploring the island a dangerous endeavour.Colt, understandably, wants out of the nightmare. To do that he needs to break the loop. And to do that, he needs to kill all eight of the island’s Visionaries in a single, perfect day of assassinations. So he sets out to learn about them. By eavesdropping on conversations, listening to audio diaries, reading scribbled notes, and perusing computer chat logs he gradually discovers their friendships and romances, schedules and routines, and — most importantly — the most opportune time to catch pairs of them together.It’s in this way that the island slowly opens up, like a giant puzzle box loaded with hidden compartments the locks to which need to be progressively riddled out.For example, we might discover a code to a locked room in the afternoon that we’ll only be able to access in the morning, which means waiting for the next day. And in that room we might find a clue to the location of one of the Visionaries in the evening. And when we confront that Visionary we might then find a clue to where he or she might be earlier in the day meeting with another of the Visionaries.On it goes, until, eventually, all of the islands secrets are revealed and we know exactly where to be and at what time to efficiently kill all of them in the space of a single day.It’s a compelling and complex feat of storytelling, made all the more enjoyable thanks to the game’s two leads. Colt and Julianna are instantly iconic characters, engaging in playfully antagonistic repartee throughout each day.Even more interesting, once we reach a certain point in Colt’s quest we can opt to take on the role of Julianna and invade other players’ games, ruining their carefully laid plans for the day via asymmetrical (they have slightly differing abilities) player-versus-player shenanigans.As intimated above, it’s hard not to like the game simply based on Arkane’s eager willingness to do pretty much whatever it wants from start to finish, to make exactly the game they want and to hell with anyone who doesn’t like it.But such boldness also means individual parts of the game are bound to not be to everyone’s taste.Like the repetition. Yes, we do learn new things, gain access to new places, and earn fun new stuff with each new run through Colt’s infinitely iterating day. However, getting to this stuff generally requires going through a gauntlet of bad guys you’ve already dispatched multiple times before. This was my biggest beef. I’ve never been much of a fan of the so-called “roguelike” experience, and while this is one of the best such games I’ve encountered I still found the echoing action to grow a little tedious after a while.Others might not enjoy the lack of significant character growth. We do gain access to better weapons and abilities — like the power to teleport short distances and link enemies together — as the game goes on, but they’re disposable. Sure, it’s fun to, say, turn invisible, or dual-wield powerful pistols, but by the game’s end you’ll know the island so well and have become such a skillful killer that you won’t need these things to succeed. They seem to exist simply because shooters need to give players lots of nifty bang-bangs and play mechanics. At a certain point they cease to be a compelling goal.And while Julianna is a great character whose personality adds plenty to the experience, her presence as an antagonist can be annoying — especially if you’re in the middle of pursuing a critical lead or objective. You can opt to play offline, but you can’t completely avoid her. Offline players will discover that a computer-controlled version of Julianna will pop up occasionally to try mess up your day. (Happily, AI Julianna tends to be a lot easier to take on than skilled human opponents.)Also — and this is perhaps just me — I have little interest in playing as her because I don’t want to be the one to ruin someone else’s day.So to experience all the good of Deathloop you need also suck it up and suffer a bit of bad. Nothing too stinky, just enough to make you intermittently wrinkle your nose.But it’s worth it. Arkane’s newest isn’t perfect, but I suspect it will end up one of the most memorable games of 2021 simply because it’s so unlike everything out there at the moment. In a season of sequels and various licensed properties, it’s a treat to get to play something as original and unexpected as this.Financial Post Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion and encourage all readers to share their views on our articles.

Deathloop,Brendan Caldwell,"Rock, Paper, Shotgun",https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deathloop-review,"Stealth is just the thing that goes wrong before a good fightWilliam Blake once wrote: ""Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand, and Eternity in an hour."" Shut up, Blake. This is Deathloop. It is a full-blown action-comedy with a double jump. You get a sideways dash and a gun that splits to become two, smaller guns. If I see anyone trying to be too smart about this game, in which a time-looping assassin tries to break free of hilarious eternity by murdering many people who deserve it, I will look at them with hollow eyes and say: ""In Deathloop you regularly snap necks by 270 degrees."" Turn away, poets and stealth likers. This is not your daddy's Dishonored.You are Colt, a buff gun professional who wakes up on the shore of Blackreef, a misty island caught in a day-long time loop and inhabited by the worst of humanity. These goons are a loose-knit cult called the ""Eternalists"", led by eight asshole archetypes. Bratty artist. Megalomaniac executive. Mad scientist. You know the ones. It's a world of snide remarks and foul-mouthed hostility but offering actual belly laughs, with sharp inter-murder banter that brings a smile. Imagine if Bioshock Infinite had a sense of humour and you basically understand this game.There are also moments of slapstick in the brutal action-hero antics. You might kick a guy into a harbour as he plays guitar, or send three machete-wielders flying with a well-placed proximity mine. This is a shooter with stealth elements, rather than an immersive sim with guns (hi Prey). The shooting is not as tight as a Doom or a Destiny, but Arkane's love of mouse smoothing has been toned down (even if an overzealous deadzone on controllers remains). If you can match its rhythm, you'll appreciate the type of hit-and-run gunbrawls it wants to encourage.But it might take a bit to reach that point. After a few hours of sneaking, blasting, hacking, and peeping into every bakery, candy store, cavern and crevice, you'll have earned some powers and learn how the time loop should be approached as a player. To break the loop, you need to kill all eight leaders of the weirdo Eternalist cult. However, they're spread throughout the island, in any of four explorable areas. Every day will have four periods: morning, noon, afternoon, and night. Your targets will be in certain zones at certain times. For example, Alexis, a wolf-masked corporate asshat, will be partying in his manor at night. Dirtbag rock star Frank will be in his club in the morning. You see where this is going. Deathloop seeks to make seasoned speedrunners of us all. But there are complications, of course. What if two targets are in different parts of the island at the same time? You'll figure it out.Areas will change as you come and go. Visit the townish district of Updaam in the morning, for example, and you'll spy two pickaxe chumps, chipping at a wall. By afternoon the chumps are gone but the wall has a handy hole in it. In the morning a mysterious building can't be reached because of a chasm, but at noon a bridge will be down, inviting you to explore. You have control over some of these changes. At noon, for instance, you'll find a workshop in Updaam has burnt down, due to a faulty generator. But if you disable that generator in the morning, the fire won't happen, leaving the workshop open for critical snooping later. This sort of interventionism works both ways. Kill those diggers I mentioned and that hole in the wall will never appear.The levels themselves are intricate. They weave together: corridors, tunnels, caves, passages, clambers, leaps, all connecting one area of note to another, so that abandoned installations which feel big in your first few hours become tight and interlaced when fully explored. The whole island is revealed quickly (it's almost overwhelming just how quickly) but the limits of each place, its secrets, its inner workings, are obscured until you spend enough loops falling into holes and stepping on landmines. It lacks a standalone hit level, a Jindosh mansion or a time travel derelict, where walls move or magic reigns. But this is because the whole game is arguably one big level of moving parts. And it's still got the Arkane staple of a masked party at one point, so, there is that.Usefully, time does not technically ""run out"". You can spend real life hours exploring in the morning and the day won't turn over to the noon phase until you actually leave that zone. This is not the strict clockwork of Outer Wilds or even Hitman. But it works for Arkane's twisting streets and diary-strewn apartments that demand noseying. The ""one zone, one timechunk"" design is a good compromise. You can also skip whole periods of time, which comes in handy if you want to spend a few loops skipping straight to the evening to kill Aleksis. Trust me, you will.You're going to die, by the way. But really you get three deaths before you truly bite the dust. They're called ""reprises"". Drown in the icy water or fall to a hail of bullets and you'll reappear a few corners back with full health. Three strikes and you're out, and have to start the loop from the top again. But survive and find your old corpse and you can suck the magic dust from its warpy bones. The same magic stuff you'll suck up from glittering objects scattered around, or the bodies of your targets. This currency, Residium, is what you'll eventually use to ""infuse"" weapons or powers to carry them across loops.In other words, you can make that one rifle you really like permanent. You can keep its reload upgrade and the power that lets you turn invisible. Just infuse them with time glitter. This soon gets silly as you become capable of saving basically everything you want from previous runs, rendering any roguelike comparisons a bit questionable. This is not quite Hades, even if it feels sometimes inspired by it. Importantly, that process of infusing only happens in a menu when you leave a zone and essentially ""clock off"".Significantly, you can't change your loadout on the move either. Between outings you decide what guns and powers to use on your next jaunt, and then that's it. No swapping one power out for another in the middle of a street fight, no fiddling with gun plug-ins to make your bullets pierce through multiple bodies, or using a quiet moment to eject one upgrade in favour of another you've just found. You pick your gear (two powers, three guns) and you commit.It might seem pointless to have useful character trinkets jangling in your pockets until the next level. But no swapping means you're not constantly pausing the game, interrupting the flow. There isn't even a weapon wheel here (thank God). This is a game about embracing the moment, not save-scumming until you get that kill juuuust right. The three ""reprises"" make mistakes forgivable and gambits inviting. Die to a fight-gone-wrong in Dishonored, and you are treated to a loading screen. Die to a misjudged brawl in Deathloop and you get a fun wobble transition and another chance to kill. It is a quicksave in all but name. As someone who struggles to love previous Arkane games thanks to a caustic mix of perfectionism and impatience, I'm pleased with how the design has evolved here.The average cultist thug doesn't care for any of this. Enemies have nasty health-chomping attacks, especially at close range. They have some differing roles, but they feel less cohesive than, say, a band of Far Cry reprobates. There are some baddies who will call for backup (you can hack their radio to stop this), while machete wielders will try to get close. But mostly, they're all very shootable meat. And that's okay. Next to Prey's nuisance ink spiders and teleporting Rorschach blots, these masked idiots are much better fodder. You can't kick an alien made of Bic juice into a ravine, that's the point I want you to discern here.A far more deadly foe is Julianna, your nemesis and potential multiplayer adversary. She will show up every day, a big red message declaring her arrival. This puts the area you're in on lockdown, and you can't leave until you hack a special antenna. Julianna might be a computer-controlled enemy, like any other high-level ""visionary"" target. Or she might be a human player, invading like a Dark Souls phantom (you can turn off these invasions easily). And you too can be Julianna, out to ruin someone's day.I did successfully invade a bunch of other reviewers. I had one running battle in a snowy mountain pass with a Colt I killed twice by filling the clearing around the critical antenna with turrets. He gunned me down in a final tense encounter. A good fight. The others were... less so. The multiplayer I find more interesting as a game of hide 'n' seek than a fluid multiplayer shooter. That's down to the speed at which Colt and Julianna are capable of moving, and the wacky way their character animations seem to move around the map. Still, we have enough competitive shooters in our lives. This cat and mouse game feels more about setting traps and being a nuisance than about being lethal with flickshots. As divisive as the multiplayer invasions are likely to be, they're key to the tension of the story. The jibing between Colt and Julianna is the heart of Deathloop. Colt is the charming rogue, playing it by ass. He's storming through on muscle memory and some inner sense of obligation, tenacity or spite; it's not clear which. Julianna is an impatient, one-step-ahead wunderkind who is frustrated by Colt's dozy predictability. They are a pair of lethal frenemies, and one of the most fun-loving duos in gaming's recent history. The excellent voice acting goes a long way.There's a lot more I liked in the 30+ hours it took to hit the credits, but I only have one life, not millions, so I can't type all day. Just know that those who prefer the quiet quicksaveyness of the Dishonoreds will grumble at the inability to use all their powers, the shift to shootybang, the disappearance of non-lethality and corpse hiding - all the signposts of a true immersive sim.Not me. Colt is High Chaos Corvo with three lives and no patience, as reckless in personality as I want to be in play. His boot contains more power than any Outsider's mark, and stealth is just the thing that goes wrong before a good fight. More surprising is that, despite the wonkiness, I'm ready to play more games as a sneaky, invading Julianna in multiplayer. Because she's right.

Deathloop,David Burdette,GamingTrend,https://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/deathloop-review-getting-loopy/,"So you’ve just been stabbed through the chest by a woman with a machete. No big deal, you wake up that morning, go about your business, and in the evening she blows out your brains from a mile away. Now you’re mad. You begin to plan the set up (act natural, nothing suspicious going on here), and you track your next target at noon – she doesn’t suspect a thing. She thinks she knows where you are when, suddenly, BAM! You got the drop on her, this time, but you know she’ll be back tomorrow, and so will you to do this dance all over again.Deathloop has always looked super interesting to me, but I was never sure if it was “my type of game”. Now, don’t get me wrong, I absolutely love stealth action games, where you get to make a decision in how you approach the level. In fact, I’m the one who gave Hitman 3 a 90/100 early this year. But after playing so many games with a rogue-lite styling (looking at you Returnal and 12 Minutes), I wasn’t sure I wanted to relive the same day over and over again. Well, look at me now, I’m playing Deathloop anyway (along with editor David Flynn who’s giving me a hand on this one), and even with some qualms about the gameplay I’m still having a good time with it.So, Deathloop involves you waking up as this character named Colt, although you don’t exactly know this right off the bat. You start the game, die a gruesome death, and suddenly you’re on a beach with no recollection of anything, and words floating in the air trying to guide you in the right direction. It’s almost as if you know something; you’ve been here before, but it’s like you’ve woken up from a bad dream and within seconds you don’t remember it. Shortly after perusing the area, a girl named Julianna calls you on your hackamajig (yes, that’s literally the name of the tool), and starts berating you for some reason. While we know her as our opening murderer, Colt doesn’t, and it’s only through progressing through the game that we’ll both get even more knowledge as to why she wants to kill us, and why we’re stuck in this time loop in the first place.Once you’ve done a little digging, you discover your goal; to kill the eight visionaries holding the loop together so you can escape. The only problem is figuring out the how: protocol dictates they’re never in the same place at the same time, and you can only visit four places in a day. Oh, and anything you pick up in a loop disappears when you die or the day ends. Essentially, you need to figure out how to amass an arsenal and kill the visionaries in the most efficient way possible. The former is your first quest, completing it allows you to absorb an energy called Residuum which you can use between excursions to keep your gear between loops. This includes weapons, character and weapon enhancing trinkets, and the all important Slabs.Probably the coolest and toughest thing about the game is piecing together just how to do everything. There is a journal where you keep track of your progress in quests, finding better weapons, and discoveries that lead you on your way, but there is no hand holding. The initial startup does at least put you in the position to walk the road of your main quest, but it’s all up to you from here. This comes from a lot of different things, but whatever it may be it can influence how you go about killing your target, as well as lining up your targets across a single loop to kill them.The story of figuring out why the loop exists, what it is, why you’re here, and who everyone is incredibly interesting especially as it lets you figure everything out yourself for the most part. Overheard conversations, audio logs, written notes, and even art or decorations around the four main locations all have some significance if you go out and pursue it. The balance of not being handhold-y and stopping the player from getting completely stuck is a fine rope to walk, and Deathloop does stumble a few times throughout the main story. For one, if you complete all of your quests and don’t discover another along the way, you’re basically left with nothing to do aside from wander around and hope you find something. This happened once or twice in my playthrough, and it took at least a full loop (around an hour to an hour and a half) to remedy the issue each time.Once you reach the end, however, is where the game stumbles hardest in the opposite direction. I had a lot of fun piecing together exactly the steps needed to kill every visionary in one run, but once you have all their quests done the game just gives you the answer. It takes all that satisfaction you got from the game’s open-endedness and makes it feel much more linear. What’s the point of all this experimentation if you’re just going to solve it for me? Regardless, the execution of your plan is still a lot of fun, and the ending was interesting if a little too light on details. There may be multiple endings, we were a little quick on the trigger as Julianna would say, so it may be interesting to go back and see what else the game has to offer outside of the main quest.As for getting through the story, the gameplay itself is quite crisp. We played on PlayStation 5, and it definitely felt like the performance mode operated at the smoothest 60 frames you can as for. The movement feels similar to that of its predecessor in Dishonored, down to the Shift Slab that allows you to teleport to specific points you desire. That’s not a bad thing in the slightest, as Dishonored is a shining example of how to do gameplay in an immersive sim. It seems the team at Arkane decided to take the best parts of that game, and integrate it into Deathloop, and that was a fantastic decision.Of course, the reason you play one of Arkane’s games is to explore the areas and figure out the most interesting ways to kill your enemies. While it doesn’t seem there’s as much to unpack as Dishonored, at least in killing the visionaries, there is definitely plenty of ways to murder your mostly unsuspecting prey. You can stab them in the back, break their necks, shoot them with all manners of guns, like silenced pistols, shotguns, SMGs, snipers, throw them with telekinetic powers, and many, many other avenues. One of our favorites was the PT-6 Spiker, a pneumatic weapon made to silently launch nails directly into your foes’ skulls. While all these methods are possible, you also have the option of taking foes on head on or as stealthily as possible. I’d suggest using stealth as much as you can, because while the AI in this game can be pretty stupid, they have a lot of strength in numbers.One of the things that makes the combat feel unique is of course, the Dualsense controller. A lot of people expected the controller to be one and done, something developers messed with at launch and forgot about afterwards, but I’ve been happily surprised at the support so far, and especially with its use in Deathloop. The adaptive triggers are exceptional, with the resistance adjusting with each weapon. The nail gun is another winner here, with the feeling of the pressure building in the air chamber as you pull back on R2. While maybe not as impactful, the haptics are also fantastic, with a little pitter patter trickling through as you walk, the crunch of the snow underneath your feet, and just attention to detail in every aspect of the utilization. The only thing that surprised me? I didn’t see much of the “gun jam” that’s been advertised so much by PlayStation. Maybe it was finding plenty of good guns to use right off the bat that didn’t jam much, but I expected more of it.Along with upgrading your arsenal, you’re going to spend plenty of time collecting trinkets and upgrading your abilities and weapons, as well as the Slabs. These play out as actual upgrades rather than strengthening a number, and remind me of adding perks, similar to say God Of War 2018’s pommel stones for the Leviathan Axe. Some may be just a little extra recoil control, and others can be as odd as enemies aiming for your chest instead of head. There are also several Slab upgrades that can be fun to mess with, and these can even be situational depending on the location you visit. For instance, Updamm has plenty of buildings and rooftops, so using Shift to teleport is imperative, but upgrading it with a perk that allows a second shift in midair could be the difference in making it to a distant window. There’s plenty to it, including deciding which ones you want to tag along into the next loop, but it’s pretty cut and dry.Speaking of your stuff tagging along, as we mentioned earlier, this is possible given an element called Residium, and it adds a strategic component to everything. I’m a pack rat by nature in most games, beating final bosses with way too many health potions left over, so this feature hurts my soul. I want to keep everything, but you have to think it over quite often, especially as sacrificing one trinket could give you the extra Residium to keep another. Weapons are similar, but even more important, given if you drop one to exchange with another, it’s missing for the rest of the loop at least if you infused it with Residium, or gone for good if you didn’t.Now, one thing I’m not as big of a fan of is the grind. This game isn’t a roguelike/lite, but given its time loop it features the trappings of one. It’s a lot easier, considering there are four different parts to the loop, and if you at least manage to escape the morning, noon, afternoon, or night of the location you choose to go to you’ve made it to safety, besides your overall progress being saved. That being said, you are going to grind your way through each of the four levels a bunch, and even though there are differences to each one at those different times, it’s going to get a little old after a bit. The enemies even spawn in the exact same places, so you can get it all down to a science. Not only that, but the only way to upgrade your Slabs is by killing the visionaries over and over, so powering those up at all is going to take you through multiple loops. Definitely try your best to follow the journal to optimize your runs, but eventually a loop is going to feel lost because you missed something.Now, this review wouldn’t be complete without talking about the co-op, and we did a good amount of that. While the feature is overall a ton of fun, we’ve had more than a few loops completely ruined by Julianna. When you start up the game, you’re given the option to either break the loop in Colt’s single player campaign or protect the loop by invading other people’s games as Julianna and killing Colt before he can finish whatever he’s doing in an area. Some of the game’s best moments come from outwitting another player, but there are times in the single player where I just want to progress, and an AI Julianna can invade even when you turn off the online. Her AI is pretty stupid, so at least it won’t mess up your headway, but other players are anything but.Julianna progresses a bit differently from Colt. She has potential access to everything he does, but earns new gear by ranking up through stopping Colt. Each level will give you a bunch of new toys to play with, mostly new trinkets, but you’ll occasionally get new slabs as well. She only begins with Karnesis and Masquerade, which allows her to exchange appearances with any enemy, and it takes an annoyingly long time to get the arguably essential shift slab to get around levels (around level 14 or 16). Still, this mode is a lot of fun and will keep the game interesting for quite a while.While the Julianna player’s goal is to kill Colt, we actually found a lot of enjoyment in doing the opposite. She won’t be initially attacked by the eternalists and visionaries, but you can kill and interact with them just like in single player. This can break the game in a few ways (you can just walk up to visionaries and kill them instantly if you want) but it still has its challenges and is a great way to play the game with friends. If there’s a sequel, followup, or even a content update of any kind, we’d definitely like to see a proper co-op mode included.Finally, let’s talk about Deathloop’s incredible aesthetic. The game’s promotional art used stylings and techniques popular in the 60’s, and that carries through to basically everything in the rest of the game. The music especially is fantastic and catchy, even if you don’t hear it too often when sneaking around. The architecture and decor of each area you visit is reminiscent of the decade as well while putting actually fun level design first and adding its own spin on the stylistic trappings. While most enemies are dressed… oddly, you can unlock new outfits for Colt and Julianna by leveling up in the latter’s mode. Both have quite a few outfits, but they all look great. Specifically, my (Flynn’s) favorite was a simple pink hoodie for Julianna, since I was trying to get an all pink arsenal including a light pink sniper rifle and bedazzled pink dual pistols. The game takes the tacky-ness of its influence and turns it up to a glorious 11 and we just can’t get enough.Deathloop is a great game, if kind of a mixed bag in ways. On one hand, the gameplay is some of the most refined Arkane has done, and they give you almost an “easy mode roguelite” to play, along with a little opposition via co-op to spice it up. On the other however, the story can stumble, and the grind can be a bit too monotonous. Deathloop walks a bit of a fine line, but overall has enough fun ideas to keep things mostly fresh and fun for Colt and Julianna players alike.—David Burdette and David FlynnSee below for our list of partners and affiliates:One of the longest running independent gaming news, reviews and culture sites on the web.The thing that is magical about the Wizarding World isn’t the magic – it’s...by Ron BurkeThe world is going to end.

Deathloop,Keith Stuart,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/sep/15/deathloop-review-chaos-on-repeat,"PC, PlayStation 5; Arkane/BethesdaThis time-loop shooter interrogates the inherent repetition of video games – or just lets you revel in supremely choreographed mayhemIf you didn’t think you needed a hyper-violent interactive version of Groundhog Day directed by John Woo in his prime, with sets stolen from the Moulin Rouge, you clearly haven’t played Deathloop. This is an unapologetically breathless, adrenaline-drenched time-loop shooter from Arkane Studios, makers of Dishonored and Prey, and it gives players immense freedom to explore, combine weapons and powers such as telekinesis, and blast the crap out of things.Set on a strange island named Blackreef, where a space-time fissure has caused the same day to continually reset, Deathloop pits wisecracking assassin Colt Vahn against Julianna Blake, the head of a secret organisation that has taken advantage of the chronological anomaly to build a weird, hedonistic utopia. Colt wants to shut the loop down by assassinating all of Blackreef’s eight leaders in one day; Julianna wants to stop him.For the player, this means reliving the same 12-hour period over and over, getting ever more familiar with the island’s inhabitants and buried secrets. Colt can pick a few of the weapons, powers and items he finds to keep for the next time loop, and you need to make tactical decisions about what suits your style of play. You can sneakily scale the rooftops, quietly hacking security cameras and picking off enemies one by one, or you can leap straight into the crowd with an eviscerating shotgun and a fistful of grenades.But this is Arkane, of course, one of the most stylish and intellectual studios currently working in mainstream games, so Deathloop offers more than just cathartic action. Players also need to work out the rules of the loop, using multiple revisits at different times of day to piece together information, listening in to conversations to get tips on how targets might be assassinated. Two of the characters are having a secret affair, so could they be taken out at once? One guy is obsessed with fireworks and isn’t great on health and safety – surely a deadly accident waiting to happen? The beauty of the structure is that there’s no rush to discover these narrative threads – you can always revisit them on the next go-around.Blackreef is a luscious world constructed with the idiosyncratic eye for detail we’d expect from this team. Art deco buildings combine with 1960s kitsch and the towering painted billboards of Weimar Berlin, building a glorious picture of a ruinous, elitist society and spectacle. Filled with brilliant graphic design, it is a world that can be explored like an art gallery. What it doesn’t have is the all-encompassing, dread-heavy atmosphere of the Dishonored games, which imbued every building, every street, every object with a sickly Victorian pallor. Deathloop is more self-consciously showy, a theme-park dystopia, a ready-made backdrop for the acrobatic thrills it provides.It’s also not as daring and morally nuanced as Dishonored. Those games sought to temper the player’s aggression by making the world a darker place for all their violence and giving plenty of options for non-lethal approaches, but Deathloop hands you an orgy of set-piece shootouts and practically dares you to dive in. Incorporating elements of Bioshock and Portal, and channelling anarchic shooter Bulletstorm with its acrobatic and super-choreographed gunplay, this is more a more indulgent and accessible game than its predecessors.But Deathloop definitely has things to say. Alongside other recent time-loop adventures 12 Minutes, Returnal and Outer Wilds, it is part of a growing trend among modern developers to really interrogate the structural and experiential repetition inherent in mainstream action-adventure games. If it feels like you have been in these worlds before, if it seems like you have already fired these weapons, explored these buildings, completed these fetch quests and fought in these choke points, it’s because you have – many, many times. Every action shooter is a loop of death shared between the designer and the player, and Arkane definitely wants to talk about what that means while you blast its world to pieces.The things is, you don’t have to think about anything if you don’t want to; you can just enjoy the adrenaline rush, blasting symbolic victims of player violence (enemies even disappear in a whirl of multicoloured light when shot, a self-reflexive reference to the sheer disposability of non-player characters). But a darker subtext is always there, if you want to look beneath the gleaming surface.In this way, Deathloop gets to have its cake and eat it – over and over again. And it is, to be fair, absolutely delicious. Deathloop is out now, £49.99"

			Dishonored developer Arkane makes its pitch for game of the year with this deliciously complex Kubrickian timeloop
		Halfway through Deathloop developer Arkane’s previous assassination fable Dishonored 2, you come across the heralded Clockwork Mansion. It is a remarkable piece of game-making; a shifting, morphing millionaire’s home where the rooms transform and shift around each other like a demented rubik’s cube.Deathloop feels like the ethos of the Clockwork Mansion writ large. Its whole construction is of a similar mind-bending intricacy, except its moving parts are not mechanical walls and revolving staircases, but time. Its Groundhog Day-esque loops are nothing new, granted, but rarely has the concept been used in games with such mechanical bravura. Multiple timelines, player skills and discoveries are layered on top of each other until you have Deathloop’s fabulous temporal mille-feuille. You might not understand the recipe or technical skill that goes into its making, but you do know it is entirely delicious.You are apparent amnesiac Colt Vahn, waking up on the sun-dappled shore of Blackreef Island. It is a brilliantly twisted place; in each of its four districts you might find a cavernous hangar housing a cult, an exclusive member’s club outfitted in 70s psychedelia, sprawling laboratories or a tower block transformed into a deadly real-life RPG. Patrolling the island are heavily armed ‘Eternalists’, mask-wearing hedonists straight out of Clockwork Orange bedecked in lilac rollnecks and assault rifles. It’s a trip.Blackreef has been purposefully placed in a single-day timeloop, the island resetting at midnight with death and consequence reversed. Colt has, for reasons that unfurl with his own memory, taken it upon himself to break the loop and escape the island for good. This means killing the eight eccentric ‘visionaries’ that run Blackreef in a single day. Colt is an efficient assassin and none of the visionaries on their own should give him too much trouble, but getting them together is the real trick. The whole island is put on alert by Julianna, a kindred spirit of sorts with Colt who is determined to protect the loop, sending murderous eternalists to track you down. Or hunt you down herself.Thus, amongst slaughtering eternalists in devilishly potent combat, Deathloop becomes a game of manipulation and discovery. Each day is split into four distinct time periods with you able to visit each district morning, noon, afternoon or night. Here you will track down leads to visionary whereabouts and uncover knowledge that may allow you to get the drop on them. A thread in the afternoon in one district may lead you to another elsewhere the following morning… and so on. It becomes a gordian knot of opportunity. While the majority of the island’s denizens forget what happens in the previous loop, Colt retains his memory to build up a catalogue of visionary movements, passcodes to doors and crucial info that might stop him being blown up in a nuclear apocalypse, for example.But for all of its twisted complexity, Deathloop is startlingly intuitive to navigate. Leads are catalogued neatly and are easy to follow from one timespan and location to the next. What could easily fall into grinding repetition is smartly opened up into brisk progression. Each time you enter a loop, you will likely have a number of leads to pursue. And rarely will you exit one --either by death or making it to midnight unscathed-- without picking up something of benefit. Be it a new weapon --which can be carried over to the next loop by being infused with ‘residuum’-- or a new piece of info. For a game about a timeloop, it is remarkable how rarely you feel you are repeating yourself.It helps that Deathloop’s combat is such a malleable pleasure. Arkane have always had a fine grasp of action, somewhat sidelined by a focus on stealth, whereas Deathloop is far more energetic and encouraging of more direct action. Its exotic arsenal roars with intent; thunderous handcannons which can belch poisonous gas, silent nailguns and pinwheeling shotties. On the offhand you have a selection of grenades and mines or your ubiquitous hackamajig which can turn turrets on their owners. But perhaps your best weapon is your trusty boot, able to punt unsuspecting eternalists off cliffs and into Blackreef’s freezing coastal water.Gluing it all together are the ‘slabs’, plundered from vanquished visionaries and giving you a range of magical powers. Anyone that has played Dishonored will be familiar with their language. Shift allows you to teleport over short distances, flanking unsuspecting goons and zipping to the rooftops. Nexus is a devilish contraption that links eternalists’ fates --what happens to one, happens to all-- meaning you can wipe out an entire dancefloor with a single bullet. Aether makes you near invisible, Karnesis is telekinetic while Havoc sends you into a buffed rage.The structure of the game heartily encourages experimentation. Dishonored’s city of Dunwall would become plague-ridden the more you killed, but Deathloop’s cheery lack of consequence casts no such judgment. Slabs can be upgraded by killing their original owner again and again, while they dovetail so neatly together that it almost seems cruel to limit you to two in your loadout. The vivid eternalists are more of a threat at the start of the game (before you tool up) and can be deadly in packs if not properly handled, but later they become your playthings. Tossed around like brightly coloured skittles as you increase in power and learn the different nooks and crannies of each district.Things get more disrupted when Julianna invades your area and goes on the hunt. She disables your escape routes and packs a punch. She also has the ‘Masquerade’ slab, which allows her to disguise herself as an eternalist. Julianna can be a computer-controlled enemy parachuted in to stem your progress or another online player invading your game. Deathloop’s other half has you trying to kill Colt, jumping into other people’s timelines and causing a nuisance in exchange for increasingly powerful kit to make your mischief.Julianna is also the game’s most characterful star. Most of the time she is on the other end of a radio, taunting and teasing Colt as he goes about his business. The chemistry between the two leads is electric and played with a breezy humour that gives the game a narrative life that it perhaps doesn’t capitalise on elsewhere. Much of your interaction with the Visionaries comes through manic recordings and hastily scrawled notes, which dishes out detail and shines a light on Blackreef’s unusual history.They’re brilliantly done, but by its nature Deathloop lives in the moment. There is a hankering to explore Blackreef’s hedonistic party a little more. Eternalists are often drunk and scrappy, staggering around and quick to forget your presence if you disappear into the shadows. If you take the time to look around its edges, you will find evidence of Blackreef’s inhabitants enjoying their consequence-free lifestyle. One particular daredevil has crammed himself into a human cannon and begs for the trigger to be pulled so he can end this loop in some style, for instance. Deathloop’s Kubrickian set design is a thing of detailed beauty, but its all hands alert means much of its heaving party is left to the imagination.Still, it means that the game is able to be laser-focused on Colt’s task. For all of its complexities under the hood, Deathloop is Arkane’s most accessible game yet and elicits constant satisfaction. The action is a pleasure, while its main drive has you constantly picking up pieces of an unknown puzzle that are pieced together in separate chunks, before the frisson of excitement when the full picture starts to form. What’s extraordinary is how Arkane make it seem so easy. Blockbuster game-making at its smartest and most essential.Deathloop is out now for PS5 (version tested) and PC"
Deathloop,Brendan Lowry,Windows Central,https://www.windowscentral.com/deathloop-review,"No offers foundWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.Whether with award-winning games like Dishonored 2 or criminally-underrated cult classics like 2017's Prey, Arkane Studios has brought a ton to the immersive sim genre over the last decade. In 2021, the developer is back with a concept unlike any other: Deathloop, a ""murder puzzler"" set on the remote island of Blackreef, where a mysterious time loop resets daily. The game tasks protagonist, Colt, with figuring out how to kill eight different ""Visionaries"" in a single in-game day. Doing so will break the cycle of time loops.Failing to accomplish this (or dying during the attempt) will lead to a reset. However, you can take advantage of these time loops by searching for clues and chasing leads, herding multiple Visionaries into one location, adding efficiency to your executions. As you progress through the game, you'll also be hunted by a mysterious woman named Julianna, pushing back on efforts to end the loop. By default, Julianna is an AI enemy, but she can be controlled by other players if playing online.Overall, Deathloop is, without a doubt, one of the most creative and unique immersive sims to date. And between the game's stellar gameplay, immaculate level design, slick presentation, and comedic writing, it's nothing short of a triumph.Bottom line: Deathloop is one of Arkane's finest games yet, featuring incredible gameplay, excellent levels, tons of charm, and writing that's sure to bring a smile to your face. Watch out for the overly demanding specs and the occasional performance dip on PC, though.There's a lot to love about Deathloop, but its gameplay tops the list. Like you'd expect from an immersive sim, there are multiple different ways to approach level exploration and combat. Everything from stealthily moving through levels unnoticed to going on a guns-blazing rampage is perfectly viable, though there are situations where some approaches are better than others (especially when fighting Visionaries, as each one poses a unique threat). Plus, Deathloop just feels so slick to play, which helps set it apart in the space. Melee assassinations are brutal yet satisfying, guns are snappy and powerful, while Colt's slides and clambers feel fluid and responsive. It's to be expected given Arkane's previous titles, but the developer has delivered beyond expectations with Deathloop.The game also has an excellent progression system, both in terms of the gameplay and the story. On the gameplay side, you obtain powerful items called Slabs and Trinkets as you complete time loops, boosting stats, or unlocking abilities like invisibility or Dishonored-style teleportation. You can also find and equip advanced weapons with unique traits, such as a machine gun that causes explosions with each headshot. All of this gear will be lost if the player completes a loop, but players can also ""infuse"" gear to make it a permanent component of their arsenal. Therefore, you'll get stronger with each loop, which helps you kill Visionaries and their henchmen more efficiently. These unlocks will also be used against you when Julianna invades your levels, but taking her down will reward her kit, along with plenty of resources.From a story perspective, the game uses helpful waypoints and reminders to help you keep track of what you need to do next to get multiple Visionaries together in one place. While the game was initially holding my hand through the ""murder puzzle,"" in retrospect, these aides helped prevent juggling an overwhelming volume of information. I still had to put in a lot of thought to succeed, but there was never a point where I felt lost.Deathloop's level design is also stellar. Each level has a ton of different secrets, routes, and hidden pathways to discover, and depending on the time of day you visit them, new paths will open up that reveal previously hidden sub-areas. Each level is also built to accommodate whichever playstyle you prefer, with cover for intense gunfighting, and ample hiding spots for stealth.Deathloop is one of the most stylish games I've ever played, hands down.I also came to love Deathloop's presentation, which oozes charm and style. Blackreef's '60s-inspired retro-future aesthetic is slick, vibrant, and colorful, and in many ways, it feels symbolic of the ways in which the island's residents abuse the time loop to engage in endless debauchery from dawn until dusk. Deathloop also features Arkane's classic stylized visuals that fans have come to know and love over the years, and it fits Blackreef's snazzy party-filled atmosphere perfectly. The soundtrack is fantastic, too; players can expect to hear everything from smooth guitar riffs to snazzy electronica as they go on their killing sprees.Lastly, Deathloop's story is well written, with lots of entertaining characters, twists, and jokes. Colt and Julianna constantly bicker throughout the story, and as you figure out how to efficiently kill the Visionaries, you'll get opportunities to learn about their strange, disturbing, and comical personas. The dialogue was, in most cases, well voice-acted and enjoyable to listen to, although there were a few times where Colt and Julianna were talking so fast that it was hard to keep up.There's not much that I dislike about Deathloop, but there are a few gripes I have with it. My main issue with the game is that the graphics and visuals, while certainly pretty and stylish, don't justify how demanding Deathloop is specs-wise. Bethesda states the game requires an i7-9700K, an NVIDIA RTX 2060, and 16GB of RAM just to hit 1080p 60FPS on high settings, which seems crazy for a stylized PC game like this. My i7-9700K rig with an NVIDIA RTX 3070 and 32GB of RAM managed to hold a stable 60FPS playing on high settings with an ultrawide 1440p monitor, but I was getting VRAM usage warnings throughout my playthrough (trying to use ray tracing nosedived performance).The demanding requirements would be less frustrating if the game had NVIDIA DLSS 2.0 upscaling as an option, but it doesn't; only AMD FSR is available to use, and while it does help a bit, it's far less effective than DLSS. It's disappointing that DLSS 2.0 isn't here, as it means I (and many others) won't be able to use ray-traced lighting with high settings without significant performance hits.I also experienced a few notable performance issues throughout my playthrough on PC. The worst of these was a significant FPS drop down into the 20s that I couldn't fix without restarting the game, although this only happened one time. The game also stuttered in some cases as I played through each level.Deathloop's overly demanding PC specs, lack of NVIDIA DLSS 2.0, and minor performance issues aren't ideal, but they're just minor annoyances for a title of this caliber. Its gameplay is phenomenal, its style, world, and level design are superb, and its writing enterains throughout. What more could you want out of an immersive sim?Deathloop is my favorite game in 2021 so far and it's easily one of the best PC games available, and it'll be exciting to see how the Julianna PvP invasions in online mode spice up the experience once the game publicly launches and I begin a second playthrough. Ultimately, Arkane has created something unique and special with Deathloop, and I can't recommend it enough.Deathloop is available for $60 on Windows PCs and PS5, and it's expected to eventually launch on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S in 2022 as well.Bottom line: Deathloop is one of Arkane's finest immersive sims yet, and I can't recommend it enough. Between its superb gameplay, quirky design, charming style, and entertaining writing, it's a blast to play from start to finish.Brendan Lowry is a Windows Central writer and Oakland University graduate with a burning passion for video games, of which he's been an avid fan since childhood.

Deathloop,Charlie Coleman,Gaming Nexus,https://www.gamingnexus.com/Article/7415/DEATHLOOP/,"Am I the only one that, no matter how many trailers and adverts I saw for Deathloop, couldn’t for the life of me make sense of what the game was actually about? I remember seeing the original reveal and thinking it was an Arkane-infused PvP assassin game. It’s a testament to the creative risk that Arkane has taken to deliver a game that, in the months before it’s release, confused a lot of us. In truth, Deathloop only made sense to me after I was a few hours deep into the many Deathloops I have put the wise-mouth protagonist Colt through. So, how did I make sense of Deathloop? By not making sense of it. Nowadays, we’re so quick to put games into boxes as first-person shooters, puzzle games, etc. and one can see why this has come about; most games stick to the style and functions of the genre they belong to. Deathloop, on the other hand, transcends categorization and amalgamates the best parts of multiple genres. It’s a first-person shooter, a puzzle game, a rogue-like, a stealth game, an action game, it’s a Souls-like, it’s…Deathloop.“Am I supposed to do this everyday for the rest of my life? F--- that!” exclaims Deathloop’s protagonist, Colt, as he first realizes he’s stuck in a Deathloop. The mysterious antagonist Juliette bites back “Good luck with that, a--hole!” Arkane’s take on Groundhog Day is first and foremost delivered through some of the finest voice acting in any video game. You play as Colt, at least through the main story, a cocky action dude akin to Samuel L Jackson in many of his films. Colt delivers brilliantly written back and forth with the snarky Julianna as the two squabble like bitter ex-lovers. Julianna is first presented as an invader who taunts Colt every chance she gets, clearly knowing a lot more about Colt than he knows about himself. If the Batman and Joker represent what happens when an immovable object meets an unstoppable force, Colt and Julianna represent what happens when an unstoppable cocky guy trying to break a time loop meets an immovable, equally cocky girl, trying to protect the loop. It’s an incessant battle of wills, and the chemistry between the two immediately lets you know that you’re in for a good time. As the titular Deathloop suggests, Colt is stuck in a never-ending time loop and yep, dying is inevitable and frequent. At the end of every day, split into Morning, Noon, Afternoon and Evening, the loop resets and the party starts all over again. The playground that holds Colt, Julianna, and all other inhabitants in this time loop is the island of Blackreef. Blackreef is a lawless island split into four distinct districts connected by a tunnel system that Colt traverses. Anyone that’s played an Arkane game before knows what they can expect; the cartoonish Arkane aesthetic juxtaposed with dark humour. Deathloop, however, has a more lighthearted tone than previous Arkane games, and, the overall art style really supports this tone. Deathloop borrows the best bits from Arkane’s Dishonored gameplay-wise with similar dual-wielding fighting styles, supernatural abilities, multi-layered level design, and more. The Arkane DNA is clear to see but unlike their previous games which sometimes discouraged too much outright violence, Deathloop is practically fist-bumping you after killing as many enemies - or Eternalists and they’re known in Blackreef - as you can, in the most creative ways imaginable. It would’ve been nice to see more enemy variety, however. The four districts, Updaam, The Complex, Fristad Rock, and Karl’s Bay, each have their own story to tell and it’s down to the player to listen in on conversations, read notes and discover hidden environmental clues hidden in the nook and cranny of each district. Functionally, entering a district will commit one of your time slots, and leaving the area through the tunnels will advance the time of day to the next slot. The wider objective is to break the loop. In order to do that, Colt learns that he must take out 8 targets, known as Visionaries, all in one day, in the same loop. These 8 Visionaries are eccentric, infused with supernatural abilities, and killing them will require putting your thinking cap on. You see, it’s simply impossible to kill all 8 before the loop ends without first studying each and every Visionary. Whether it’s listening in on the conversation of some goons or reading a Visionary’s diary, it’s as important to learn their weaknesses as it is their patterns. Breaking the loop requires killing multiple Visionaries within the same time period so learning when, where and how you can do that is the key to breaking the loop. It will take many loops to piece together everything needed to kill all 8 Visionaries in the same loop and, in the beginning, re-starting a loop means Colt losing all his gear. At the start, that’s only really his guns but as you progress and uncover Slabs and Trinkets, losing those will start to feel a lot more gut-wrenching. Trinkets are much like Runes from Dishonored or perks from contemporary first-person shooters; these allow Colt to boost his weapon(s) or his person. Like all gear in Deathloop, these range in rarity and description. Whether you prefer a stealthy playstyle or to go all guns blazing, there’s Trinkets to be found in Deathloop to compliment your desired playstyle. Slabs are the rarest gear in the game as they’re the artifacts that bestow their holder with supernatural abilities. Colt’s first slab, Reprise, is locked and allows him to resurrect up to two times while exploring an area before dying a third time will end the current loop he’s in. To acquire other Slabs, Colt must take out a Visionary or Julianna and loot it from their possession. Each Slab has a unique supernatural ability. For instance, Nexus allows the holder to link multiple enemies so that any harm inflicted upon one is felt by all. Each Slab is powerful in its own right but Colt can only equip 2 alongside Reprise. Slabs also have multiple upgrades that influence their power which are acquired by looting the slab again in another loop. Thankfully, it doesn’t take too long until Colt discovers Infusion. Upon killing his first Visionary, Colt learns the process of Infusion. Infused weapons and gear can be carried over between loops. However, Infusion is a costly process that requires the use of Residuum which can be gathered by exploring districts or collecting it from dead Visionaries. This means players must prioritize what gear they want to keep as you’ll simply have to sacrifice some between loops. If you die before making it back to the tunnels, you’ll lose any Residuum collected. So, it’s important to get back to the tunnels and spend it before losing it when a new loop begins. My personal recommendation is to focus on infusing weapons and slabs first of all, then to infuse the trinkets that suit your playstyle. My only criticism of Infusion is that it actually provides too much security. I might’ve preferred a system where infused gear deteriorated over time. Alas, it’s just a small criticism in a game where I otherwise struggle to find anything to complain about. Luckily, Colt can always pick up the trusty hackamajig (no, I haven’t forgotten what it’s called, it’s just genuinely called that) at the start of each loop so you needn’t worry about infusing it. Similar to hacking in the Watch Dogs series, the hackamajig allows Colt to bend the environment and technology to his (crackle...crackle)Rob Larkin here... Invading the game, invading this review…The multiplayer component of DeathLoop involves the ongoing cat and mouse match between Colt, the protagonist, and Julianna, the primary antagonist. And just like in the gameplay, in this review it’s time to invade the proceedings. So this is Rob sneaking in to Charlie’s review (just like I was sneaking into other player’s games) to voice the role of Julianna and provide the perspective from the other side of this coin. Throughout the game much of the personality of the narrative is played out in the frequent back and forth between the two’s voices over the radio, but on occasion in each loop, the verbal barbs become actual bullets. Julianna is on Colt’s case from the moment he wakes each Loop, notifying the rest of the residents of his treachery with an island-wide announcement, placing the bounty on his head - and when the opportunity presents itself - jumping into his location to lock down the exit and force a confrontation. The brief is simple: to escape Colt can choose fight or flight with Julianna, but he must shut down an antennae that pops into view as a quest marker. So on the one hand, playing the main quest, multiplayer just happens as part of the story. You can choose to open or close your game off as you see fit, with no noticeable reward or penalty for each action. The first option is open play where any random player can jump in an invade your game. The second option is to set the game to friends only, exactly like it sounds, only friends can invade. The last option is single player where the game AI will take the reins of Julianna just like every other enemy. There is a little bit of a cheat in that system: if you choose friends only and none of your friends are present or willing, then you can traipse through the story points free of this particular challenge……and it can be a significant challenge indeed, because in a word, Julianna is overpowered (or is that two words: over powered?). Press materials and in game screens love to position Julianna staring Colt down through the scope of her sniper rifle, and surprisingly the base loadout does not include that gun. Fear not, it takes all of one encounter to unlock it, and by the completion of the second encounter you’ll likely have enough perks and weapons in your loadout to fear no man. Well, no man named Colt anyway. While this is meant to be a PvP component, integrated into the main storyline of the campaign, the result is something more like Pvp (little p), because Colt rarely stands a chance. It’s not just that Julianna has a stronger loadout out of the gate, and not just that that loadout gets even better with very little investment; it’s that the game is played entirely on her terms. Colt can choose fight or flight, but he must disable that antennae and to do so he must get close enough to link into it with his Hackamajig (that’s actually the name). So Julianna spawns in on top of the antennae, usually has NOC reinforcements mulling about with her, has time to set up trip mines or other defenses, and can simply camp on a choke point with support in place that Colt cannot avoid. There are some mitigating factors in Colt’s favor, but they don’t come close to balancing the scales. Colt does need to die three times in a level to end the given loop, so in some cases Julianna will need to drop him three times before he wins one duel. There is also a mechanic introduced fairly early in that allows Colt to carry over some progress in weapons and perks he picks up each Loop. Meaning that with great investment Colt does get stronger, but Julianna still has quicker access to even more strength and can craft her loadout precisely for this one task, not having to balance between both the campaign and this single encounter like Colt. Normally, the invasion is a drop-everything-and-go-sort-out-Julianna type of event. What gets a little awkward is when the little-p player that’s running Colt decides to go for flight without actually tackling the antennae. This is probably the best strategy against a human opponent. Colt has to hack the dish, but there is no timer ticking down to do so. They can choose instead to carry on with whatever objectives brought them to the location in the first place. That puts the squeeze on the Big-P player running Julianna to choose to sit patiently or go chase the rabbit. Big-P players get XP based on performance, and while there are points accrued for simply surviving in an encounter for first 3 then 10 minutes etc., there are also larger pools of returns for frustrating Colt’s objectives, preventing the assignation he might currently be running, and ultimately landing the killshot herself rather than if the player dies without the Big-P player’s intervention. But in my playtime thus far that seemed to be the best counter-strategy: test Julianna’s patience for as long as it holds and go about your business. You might spend that round looking over your shoulder constantly, but you also might get one more mitigating factor in the fight by flushing her onto a level field of engagement, not the one where she had time and opportunity to fortify and reinforce. Rob Larkin out...(crackle...crackle...)...a turret blocking your path, sneak up and hack it to turn it against the Eternalists and, not only does the turret not fire on you, it takes out all the enemies within its vicinity. Likewise, the double jump trinket is also made available practically right off the bat on every new loop and it’s all but essential for traversing the environment so definitely equip both of these in your loadout before embarking on a mission. Infusion removed a great deal of the worry I previously had when exploring districts, worried that death would mean losing all the gear I had collected. It’s an insurance that encourages players to explore, take risks and experiment in this wonderfully creative playground that Arkane have made for us in Blackreef. Deathloop is at its best when you let go of your inhibitions and, unlike Colt, take your time in the loops and enjoy it. Dying might suck but it’s just a chance to learn and grow. Explore those underground tunnels, abandoned shops or mysterious doorways; there’ll either be a super cool piece of gear there, a revealing clue, or a bunch of goons ready to give you a belly full of bullets. Either way, you’ll get a new badass piece of gear or you’ll learn something. Accidentally blow myself up trying to kill some Eternalists and a Visionary with fireworks? No problem. An invading Julianna disguising herself only to jump you and paint the walls of your flat with blood? Don’t sweat it. Every death is a lesson as you slowly but surely master the environment and get closer to piecing together a master plan to break the loop. On the PS5, Deathloop is simply a joy to play. As I hope to see every PS5 game do, Deathloop takes full advantage of the unique platform-specific DualSense features that only further immerse players into the island of Blackreef. Each gun in Deathloop is quirky in its own right and the DualSense allows players to really feel how unique their badass arsenal is. For instance, stealthier players will no doubt look to the PT-6 Spiker; a silenced nail gun where you will feel each nail fall into the magazine with granularity every time you reload your weapon. The DualSense’s adaptive triggers lets you feel the resistance as you hold to align your shot and the strong recoil felt when releasing your shot. It’s not just weapons either, unless you include the cocky wit or high kick of Colt, as Colt’s movement will also provide different sensations whether you’re running, sliding, climbing, sneaking, or teleporting your way through Blackreef. Performance-wise, Deathloop looks and runs great on the PS5. It’s not pushing the boundaries of what’s possible on the new hardware, but it doesn’t need to. Deathloop shines thanks to its uniquely Arkane art style, game design and the sense of overall polish. Like many next-gen video games, Deathloop offers up various graphical/performance modes. Performance mode offers a steady 60 FPS at the cost of removing raytracing and featuring a dynamic 4K resolution scaling. The Visual Quality mode also features dynamic 4K scaling but prioritises graphical fidelity over frame rate which can see some dips below 60. Lastly, the Raytracing mode also features dynamic 4K scaling but sees a dramatic drop in frame rate to 30 FPS to allow for high graphical fidelity and raytracing. Having tested all three, the frame rate drops simply are not worth the boosts in graphical fidelity as, once again, this is not where this game shines and nor is it where it’s meant to; the fluidity in gameplay that comes with 60 FPS should absolutely make Performance mode the go-to option.The beauty behind Deathloops’s story and mystery is that it all unfolds as you play. Just as the amnesiac Colt was struggling to wrap his head around the time loop, so was mine. The benefit of having a blank slate is that the player shares that connection with the character that they’re both learning all these things together. It’s absolute madness, anarchy, and confusion but Deathloop is downright addicting. Every time I died or the loop restarted, I couldn’t wait to jump back in and see what new information I could learn to conjure up a plan to assassinate a Visionary that Agent 47 would be proud of. Or, what secluded part of a district I had yet to explore I could discover to unlock more powerful gear. Every loop, every death, is meaningful as you learn and grow and become increasingly familiar with yourself, your environment, and your foes. Deathloop is a reminder to me that we are yet to see all that video games have to offer and every once in a while, a game like Deathloop comes along and proves that creative risk-taking and doing something no other game has done yet can have a massive pay-off. Deathloop is one of the finest, most unique experiences in the video game space in recent memory. Sure, it’s got that familiar Arkane feel, but the amalgamation of all of Deathloop’s various influences, genuinely comedic writing, great voice acting, intricate level design, and an engaging, mysterious story that unfolds as you play make Deathloop an absolute joy to play.* The product in this article was sent to us by the developer/company.

Deathloop,Mark Steighner,COGconnected,https://cogconnected.com/review/deathloop-review/,"Playing Deathloop. Arkane Lyon’s ambitious new murder mystery shooter, it’s hard not to indulge in a game of spot the influences. There’s the studio’s own Dishonored 1 and 2, of course, plus a dollop of the BioShock franchise. Add in some Quentin Tarantino stylistic extremism, classic 1960s James Bond-like villains, Austin Powers humor, and of course, Groundhog Day’s repetition. It sounds ridiculously derivative, but Deathloop manages to be one of the most engaging and original shooters I’ve played in years.Deathloop is full of mysteries and story revelations that I wouldn’t dream of disclosing, but the central conceit is that you play as Colt, some sort of agent, assassin, or operative who awakens on the beach of an island in a frigid sea, and you slowly piece together who you are, where you are, and why you are there. The “character with amnesia” is on page one of the big book of story cliches, but here it’s one of several mechanics that feel perfectly at home.As you stumble up the beach, you find clues and directives literally writ large, and you hear the voice of a woman named Julianna simultaneously cajoling, encouraging, and threatening you forward. You find weapons, ammo, and gadgets, and you begin to piece together solutions to the core puzzle of your identity and purpose. You die and start all over again, remembering at least a little of what just happened.Over the course of several deaths and rebirths on the beach, Colt and the player gain a pretty clear sense of the conflict and the mission. You’re on Blackreef, an island caught in an endless time loop. To escape the island and the loop, you need to assassinate the eight Visionaries who are responsible for– and want to preserve — the time anomaly. Making your task more difficult is that you must complete your mission in one day, and you are being hunted by basically everyone, especially your nemesis, Julianna. The island and hub city of Updaam are divided into four regions, and each region is home to a couple of the Visionaries but at different times of the four part-day/night cycle. Each time you return to your home base tunnels, you move the clock forward, and if you die, the day resets.Murder mysteries have notoriously complex stories full of red herrings, intrigue, and reversals, and Deathloop is a great example. Like the aforementioned BioShock and Dishonored, Deathloop is a masterpiece of environmental storytelling, with nearly every bit of graffiti, trash, and decor revealing something about the mod, alternative 1960s-ish setting, and its history. Of course, the beating heart of Deathloop is the love-hate relationship between Colt and Julianna, which is by turns antagonistic, strangely affectionate, and always slightly perplexing. It’s also hilarious, thanks to snappy writing and consistently excellent voice acting.Deathloop is equally dense with gameplay mechanics, systems, weapons and abilities, introduced slowly and throughout the course of the game. Although it does a good job of on-ramping the player as Colt gradually regains his memory, it can seem a bit daunting until one realizes that, for all its arcane nomenclature, Deathloop is still basically trafficking in the same kinds of perks, upgrades, and special abilities as many action games or shooters. Slabs are dropped by the Visionaries and provide powers like short distance teleportation, the ability to throw enemies or become invisible, and killing Visionaries multiple times over different loops upgrades them. Trinkets upgrade weapons and personal abilities like melee kills or jumping. There is an arcane currency that allows Colt to keep gear between loops.If ever there was a game where “play it your way” was more than a marketing line, it’s Deathloop, which allows Colt and the player genuine freedom in the way they approach assassinations, using stealth takedowns, special abilities, exploiting the environment, and of course the arsenal of pistols, rifles, shotguns, machine guns and toys like multi-function grenades. The diversity of approach takes nearly all the repetition out of replaying the same mission multiple times. Eventually, you learn the optimal route and array of weapons, but it’s a lot of fun figuring it out.Deathloop has multiplayer of sorts, in the form of optional Soulslike invasions. You can choose to play as Julianna and invade someone’s game to hunt down Colt. If you prefer to play offline, the random invasions will still happen, but AI will control Julianna. This mechanic, along with the fact that Colt’s guns can frequently jam in the middle of a firefight, certainly adds an element of tension since dying will reset the day.While Deathloop isn’t quite as spit-shined and showy as some recent PS5 exclusives, its visual bravado comes courtesy of its art direction, which is incredibly well done, suggesting the island as some sort of enclave of the swinging 1960s that is literally stuck in time. The haptic feedback potential of the DualSense controller is well integrated and adds both a sensory element to gameplay and additional immersion to the gunplay. However, the shooting itself is closer to Fallout than Call of Duty. Environmental audio and voice acting are absolutely top drawer, and Tom Salta’s musical score is one of the most varied, interesting, and effective that I’ve heard in months, and this has been a year of excellent game music. Using 1960s-flavored guitar and rock/funk riffs, snippets of pop, and more traditional orchestral sounds, Deathloop is almost constantly underscored with music, defining enemy encounters, building tension, or adding ambiance. It’s really a masterclass in-game music design.Nothing is perfect, and Deathloop is certainly no exception. Generally, its faults and issues are minor enough that they don’t often break the fun factor. The AI Eternalist minions aren’t always brilliant, and they’re hardly persistent. There are some visual glitches, characters get stuck on scenery or in animation loops, and sometimes mission markers refuse to go away even after objectives have been met. Deathloop doesn’t always clarify how its many systems work together, though there is a codex and optional tutorials. Part of the opacity is a feature, not a bug, and if we struggle a bit to understand, well, so does Colt. Still, it takes a good, long time for the story to coalesce and the action to pick up steam.If you thought Groundhog Day would have been even more awesome with guns and assassinations or that Dishonored would have been a better game if only Quentin Tarantino had directed it, you’d probably enjoy Deathloop. Despite some issues with pacing, bugs, AI, and mechanical clarity, Deathloop is smart, funny, intricately designed, and driven by engaging action, cool puzzles, and relative freedom to approach its objectives in various ways. Deathloop is an addictive and rewarding shooter and one of the most ambitious action games this year.***PS5 code provided by the publisher for review***Flexible approach to objectives

Deathloop,Jason Rodriguez,PC Invasion,https://www.pcinvasion.com/deathloop-review-pc/,"We’ve seen pop culture dabble with time loops as a theme. Hollywood has given us Groundhog Day, Edge of Tomorrow, Looper, and many other flicks. Meanwhile, the games industry has had certain offerings, including Outer Wilds, the recently released 12 Minutes, and the upcoming Lemnis Gate. In the same vein, players will get a chance to try out Deathloop, which is set to release soon. The game is made by none other than Arkane Studios, the company behind the Dishonored series.You can expect frantic action, brutal kills, rewarding stealth mechanics, and ridiculous abilities. All of these are combined with a never-ending repeat of the previous day as you try to break the cycle. Make no mistake, Deathloop is a brilliant and amazing game. However, it also suffers from several issues that are outlined in this review. Deathloop begins when your character, Colt, wakes up on the beach with no memory of how he got there. Apparently, he’s on a mysterious island called Blackreef. Worse, he’s hunted by Julianna, an assassin who works for AEON. This location has become a fortress ruled by the Visionaries of AEON who are protected by their Eternalist soldiers. Then, just as Colt is about to learn more information about this place, Julianna threatens him and he falls off a cliff. He wakes up again on the beach, still groggy but determined to break the endless time loop.From a narrative standpoint, Deathloop manages to pull you in with ease, thanks to its premise. There are cryptic clues and documents scattered around. Ghostly words and phrases hover in mid-air to warn Colt about Blackreef’s facilities.I also enjoyed the constant banter between Colt and Julianna as they attempt to get in each other’s way. Colt, simply put, is a delightful character to listen to. Unlike the stars of other action games (i.e., the hyper-aggressive or brooding types), Colt has no clue about what’s happening to him. He just wants to escape this repetitive nightmare. It leads to moments when he’s exasperated, shocked, or downright stupefied by the turn of events. It’s a very refreshing take that makes the character more relatable.One of the most interesting facets of Deathloop is how it captures the sci-fi theme of time loops perfectly. Each day or “loop” has four periods: morning, noon, afternoon, and evening. Colt is able to explore four distinct zones on the island of Blackreef. Likewise, even if he dies, he has a power slab called “Reprise” that returns him to his original position just before his demise. However, if he dies three times in one particular zone or time of day, he’ll end up back on the beach. This third death, in effect, resets the day/time loop. Your Reprise charges do get reset whenever you travel to a new zone, which is very helpful.Here’s where it gets more intriguing. Colt actually retains his knowledge of these areas, along with the clues that he’s found. For example, you could explore the Fristad Rock zone in the afternoon and learn about a locked building in the area of Karl’s Bay. If this building is only open in the morning, all you need to do is reset the day. You could head to Karl’s Bay by then to check it out.In some situations, you might find new pathways or methods of progressing further. For instance, there are two Eternalist soldiers who are trying to break open a section of a wall in the town of Updaam. You’ll notice that they’re doing this while it’s still morning. When you travel to Updaam later (i.e., noon, afternoon, or evening), you’ll see that the wall has already collapsed and there’s a side passage that lets you sneak to a new area. These little tidbits are hidden all over Blackreef, and you may discover a few secrets along the way.There are various intricacies related to how you’ll tackle objectives, too. This mechanic is highly emphasized when you’re hunting down the Visionary bosses of AEON. Colt’s main goal is to break the endless cycle, which means killing all eight Visionaries in a single day. However, because they’re all over the place, it’s impossible to take them out when you’ve just started Deathloop‘s campaign. For instance, a Visionary might await you at The Complex in the evening. Although you can accept this challenge to defeat your foe, it also means you won’t be able to battle another boss who’s only available in Updaam at night.Instead, you’ll need to be mindful of each target’s schedule and location. I’ll try to avoid spoilers as much as possible, but you’ll receive several missions and leads (some of which might take several daily cycles to complete). The idea is to ensure that you’ve got all the right tools and you’ve made the right decisions so that all your targets are eliminated in quick succession. It’s a remarkable non-linear approach that keeps you coming back for more.Julianna is also someone you need to beware of since she can appear during missions to hunt you down. As an aside, there’s an online PvP option where you get to play as Julianna. Your objective, naturally, is to eliminate a player who’s using Colt. You’ve got several abilities, such as laying down traps, calling reinforcements to Colt’s position, or outright disguising yourself as another NPC.By default, the single-player option means that Julianna is controlled by the AI whenever she appears. If you choose the “online” or “friends only” modes, then other peeps can invade you while you’re exploring (akin to Dark Souls and Bloodborne).With so many foes arrayed against you, it’s a good thing that Deathloop presents several means of annihilating hostiles. As you take out Visionaries, you’ll receive new powers/slabs. There are those that help with mobility and exploration, like Shift (a teleport) and Aether (temporary invisibility). You’ll also receive abilities that aid with combat, such as Havoc (a powerful buff), Karnesis (a telekinetic slam), and Nexus (a spell that links enemies so that everyone takes damage at the same time).Because each default power is unique, killing the same Visionary that drops these slabs provides you with an upgrade to that ability. Perhaps Shift can allow you to teleport further and Nexus can grant you health regeneration when you damage linked mobs. It’s also possible for Julianna to drop these upgrades. Unfortunately, even if you’ve obtained all possible upgrades for a slab power, Julianna might still give you a duplicate that gets wasted.Since Deathloop is made by Arkane Studios, you can expect stealth mechanics thrown in for good measure. Colt can sneak around, backstabbing enemies or breaking their necks when you catch them unaware. And, yes, there’s a device called the Hackamajig that lets you disable cameras and control turrets.Now, if you wish to go loud, you can do just that with an assortment of weapons, as well as mods to equip. You’ll see submachine guns, hand cannons, shotguns, and machine guns. You might find some golden-rarity weapons, too (i.e., legendaries). Perhaps the only downside here is that weapon variety (outside of mods) will feel a bit lacking.Just remember that when the day resets (either through your own decision or because Colt died thrice in a zone), you’ll lose all the weapons and abilities that you’ve earned. The only exceptions are those that you’ve already infused by using a resource known as Residuum. Combined with retaining knowledge and clues, one can think of Deathloop as a first-person shooter with roguelike mechanics. You restart from the beginning, but your capabilities and understanding of the world around you will grow as you progress.Sadly, I did encounter some technical hiccups. Although the game ran at 60+ fps on ultra settings at 4K resolution, I’ve experienced some annoying crashes. For example, there’s one particular mission in Updaam where I had to kill several bosses, including Julianna (because she decided to hunt me there). There was a period when, after Julianna was taken out, the game would crash while I fought other enemies. It also occurred whenever I attempted to snipe a specific wolf-masked guard from a distance. There was even a point where I had a 60-minute run. I defeated most hostiles via stealth and I was able to collect lots of Residuum in a zone. Then, just as I was about to reach the exit tunnel, a grenade exploded which led to a crash.The problem is directly tied to Deathloop‘s save system. Your campaign has one save file. You cannot manually save, and there are no checkpoints during a mission. The game only autosaves when you first arrive at a location and when you exit it. Regardless of all the tasks and objectives that you’ve tackled, a single crash is all it takes to set you back at the beginning of your run. It’s downright frustrating when mishaps occur.Furthermore, there’s another mission where the boss hid inside a bunker with a nuclear reactor. If enemies spot you and the alarm is sounded, you’ve got 60 seconds before you’re blown to bits (this is considered an actual death which means the entire day is reset). This is compounded by the fact that AI Julianna can appear in that bunker to alert enemies to your position. Oh, and you can only enter this area when it’s noontime. That means anything you did during the morning will be null and void, and you’d need to redo that part on the next cycle.As an aside, I actually had crashes while attempting to attach mods and upgrades. This may have been due to the graphics settings I’ve selected. We discuss this and other topics in our technical review.From a graphical standpoint, the visuals in Deathloop can sometimes look drab. As for character models, the Eternalist soldiers look like rejects from a Daft Punk video. Likewise, the AI can be a little braindead. You and your trusty turrets could gun down one batch, only for several soldiers to stand by without bothering to advance. At the very least, the Visionary bosses are all well done since they each have their own quirks, personalities, and unique mechanics. The environments are varied enough and the zones are massive. There are numerous pathways and rooms to explore, and certain areas will wow you because of things that you might not have noticed before. Moreover, the ’60s vibes and retro-futuristic details are a treat to behold.In the end, I still consider Deathloop a very engaging romp. It took me almost 30 hours to piece together the puzzle; all the stars aligned and I was able to eliminate the Visionaries to reach the game’s finale. Although I did encounter a few mishaps, there were some workarounds that allowed me get past those issues.Overall, Deathloop is a fantastic game that’s filled with twists and thrills. The frantic action will keep you on your toes, and the non-linear campaign will keep you retreading the beaten path in search of new discoveries. The premise is enough to hook you at the start. The rest of the campaign, meanwhile, will keep you playing just to see the conclusion of Colt’s journey. Yes, you may be dealing with a time loop, but this is one timeless offering from Arkane Studios.Outside of some annoying crashes and mishaps, Deathloop remains a stellar game with a brilliant premise, refreshing mechanics, and delightful characters. You'll repeat the same day and retread the same paths over and over. But, replayability is enhanced given how you'll discover new secrets and abilities to help you progress.About Us

Arkane Studios has designed the opening hours of the game it made after Dishonored and PREY to be overwhelming, introducing mechanic after mechanic and sprinting through its four main areas quicker than Usain Bolt on steroids. It's a lot to take in at first, and you'll likely fear working out how to escape the rock will be just as much of an uphill battle. But it won't be. Deathloop will always be there to hold your hand.Objective markers clearly signpost where to head next, quest lines make light work of tracking overall progress, menus map what stage the time loop is at. It's attentive to your needs to an almost surprising degree, providing information by the bucket load. The solution to this Groundhog Day conundrum is the same for everyone, but what gets you there represents a leap forward for the developer; never has it seemed more confident in its craft.In fact, so self-assured is the team that it has explained the game's set-up ad nauseam in pre-release trailers. Colt Vahn is trapped in a time loop that repeats the same day over and over again on the island of Blackreef, and to break it, he must kill eight targets (known as Visionaries in-game) within a single 24-hour stretch. The leaders just so happen to be celebrating their achievements on the day chosen to repeat itself, and Colt is the party pooper.Once the game opens up, you're free to visit four different parts of the island at various times of the day: morning, noon, afternoon, and evening. The eight Visionaries can only be reached at certain points in specific locations, many of which double up so you have to pick and choose your battles. And since you can't be in two places at once, the day starts over again. The early game largely revolves around learning how to kill a handful of the targets in isolation, but if you're to actually eliminate them all within a single loop and thus escape the island, a different approach is required.Here's where you begin to learn more about the Visionaries and their backstories; what are they doing on the island and how can they be manipulated into meeting up with the others so Colt can save time? You'd expect Deathloop to leave you to your own devices at this point, freely exploring the island to work out what makes the targets tick. However, it does anything but.The game tightly guides you through this process, sharing linear pathways to having targets meet up with one another or join the party that concludes the night. There's not a lot of freedom to it, to the point where Deathloop may not be exactly what you thought it was.Another expectation that may need readjusting is that the game isn't a rogue-like. All of the information you gather and progress made through quests is retained at the start of a new loop, and you can get right back to whatever point in the day you need by simply fast-forwarding time back at base. What you may lose access to is the weapons, powers, and perks collected during a loop, but there's even a system in place to prevent that. Residiuum — picked up off the dead bodies of Visionaries and spread throughout the four maps — can be spent to infuse all your gear, making it a permanent part of your arsenal for future loops.It's going to feel familiar in parts, then. We could take the reductive route and describe Deathloop as Hitman meets Dishonored meets Returnal meets Outer Wilds meets Dark Souls. Oh yes, rest assured there's a feature or two pulled from the FromSoftware locker. However, to do so would ignore what really makes the title work. It's a fantastic experience largely thanks to the wonderful, experimental gameplay Deathloop.While Arkane Studios' Dishonored series had room for chaos, it was always designed around stealth. Deathloop borrows many of those systems and then refines what happens when you choose to go loud so much that it becomes just as much of a tantalising option. Fast-paced and explosive gunplay means there's no need to save scum (you couldn't anyway due to the lack of manual saving), turning those moments when you are spotted into an opportunity to show off Colt's firepower and prowess.Both approaches are more than viable now: lay low until you've located the Visionary and then go loud to make a statement, or stick to the shadows at all times and learn of unique opportunities from nearby NPCs and documents. For example, life of the party Aleksis loves his chocolate beer. Should supply of that particular alcohol be severed, he reveals himself by ranting to fellow ravers. Then take to the rafters and eliminate him silently with a pistol or let everyone know you mean business by dropping a grenade into his lap. Play the way you want; there are no holds barred this time around.It wouldn't be an Arkane game without some powers, however, and Deathloop comes packing with abilities that greatly expand gameplay possibilities. Once again sourced from the dead bodies of Visionaries, the game has its own version of Dishonored's Blink and then a carbon-copy power of Domino from Dishonored 2. Fleshing out supernatural possibilities are Aether, which temporarily turns you invisible, Havoc increases damage dealt, and Karnesis throws enemies about the place.Astonishing is the word we'd use to explain the impact these abilities have on interacting with the environment. On your first few visits to the four areas of Blackreef, you'll be hamstrung by your powerless loadout. Enemies will have to be largely avoided and the location scanned for points of exit to keep your lives intact, of which you have three before the whole loop starts over. But the more powerful you become, the more options open up. Rooftops become much more viable options for traversal and invisibility makes escaping engagements and sneaking past enemies a streamlined process. They can turn what was a meticulous and carefully planned route through the level into a five-minute sprint to the objective that cares little for discreetness. The former will always remain an option for stealth-minded folk, however.Throwing somewhat of a spanner in the works is Julianna, a Visionary who is actively hunting you down. Controlled either by the AI or another real-life player who selects ""Protect the Loop"" from the main menu, her job is to do exactly that: prevent Colt from breaking the time loop Blackreef is currently stuck in. Much like the protagonist, she retains her memories and knowledge across loops, making her a constant threat throughout the roughly 12 to 15-hour campaign.With her on your tail, Deathloop is pushed even further into that experimental territory. The game is about knowing when to take things slow and stick to the shadows, but also learning when is the right time to go loud and get the hell out of there by any means necessary. Arkane Studios is now at a point where it can fairly balance both styles, making for a sublime experience that allows you to mix and match your approach seamlessly.Holding all this together is the story of Colt, Julianna, and the island of Blackreef itself. The revelations behind the time loop and everything going on are somewhat interesting, but the main driving force is the two main characters. Colt and Julianna just love to banter and argue over the radio, explaining how they're going to kill one another and exploring their personality and backstory. It's funny and consistently touching, particularly in the latter hours of the narrative. The other Visionaries have their own stories to tell, but they're explored through collectibles, voice recordings, and files rather than face to face dialogue. As such, nothing else can quite touch the charismatic duo at the heart of the plot.Off the beaten path are optional leads that help to open up more of the maps once solved, or you could go after the Visionaries repeatedly to cop upgrades for your powers and find the game's most powerful guns. The structure of the time loop actually enables this freedom because it never feels like you're wasting hours; going from morning to evening focusing purely on upping your loadout can bear fruit in future attempts at escaping the island. With the infusion system saving gear for another time, a run is never wasted.Some stumbling blocks do hold the game back from reaching higher heights. A few tedious objectives outside of killing the Visionaries demand you constantly restart the time loop in order to progress, leading you to essentially speedrunning proceedings if you want to further the questline. These tasks could have been implemented better to ward off players switching their brains off and sprinting to the objective three times over so headway can be made.And then there's the poor enemy AI, which has to be the game's biggest low point. Blackreef's inhabitants must have their blinders on because you can get up close and very personal with them and they won't notice a thing. An alert system operates on the usual caution and danger mechanics, but it hardly matters when it affects so little of the actual map. Three enemies can be alerted to your presence on one street, but turn a corner and anyone in the alleyway in front of you will be acting like nothing has happened. That is despite all the shouting and gunfire. It's quite bad and makes a bit of a mockery of the overall gameplay loop when enemies can be manipulated and taken advantage of so easily.As a game that skips the previous generation of consoles for a PlayStation 5-only release, you'd also think Deathloop would make proper use of the new features and horsepower at its fingertips. In some places it does. It feels like the slightly stylised look may be holding it in back in some spots, but the title overall has some nice visuals and vistas. While it's not on the same level as Demon's Souls, Returnal, or Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart — far from it, in fact — Deathloop can look good when it wants to.The PS5 DualSense controller also receives some love with haptic feedback replicating Colt's footsteps through vibrations and the adaptive triggers lending some weight to gunfire. The resistance isn't as varied as what Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War has to offer, but what's there feels efficient enough. The widely advertised feature where your gun jams has been completely over-marketed, however. We encountered it quite literally once; it's never going to be a problem for you when better gear is on offer almost instantly.Few games have the confidence and swagger of Deathloop. Packed full of charisma and wit, it's a game that can be played your way, with your own style and cunning. A very accomplished package of gameplay features supplies the goods, and the time loop delivers fun and deceitful opportunities over and over again. Deathloop may be the final game out of Arkane Studios to hit Sony consoles, but the developer goes out with an undisputed bang.Great 8/10Scoring PolicyReview copy provided by Bethesda SoftworksPlease note that some external links on this page are affiliate links, which means if you click them and make a purchase we may receive a small percentage of the sale.

Now we never have to see it at a PlayStation event ever again.(Hopefully).It honestly looks very very good, I’ve just seen it far too many times. Perhaps I’ll pick it up in the near future!I'm actually more interested now that you've mentioned how linear it is. Open-ended time loop games aren't normally my thing, so I'm happy to read that it guides you quite a bit to your objectives. I think that's going to allow me to enjoy the world and storytelling more.Yeah, unfortunately, I'll be waiting for the inevitable first price drop, primarily because I have too much to play anyway right now, but also because we all know it'll be half-price by Christmas.Happy to hear that it's a hit, though. I've always been very interested in this, and do enjoy Arkane's games a lot.Aaa this is one game I've wanted to play day one but I haven't been able to get my hands on a PS5! Glad to see it came out great.@get2sammyb And i wont be able to ever play the sequal so that gives me less of a reason to buy it at full price. Still looks fantastic though but with that and a backlog im swamped anyway and what am i saying its PS5 only so that brings a extra issue.Great review Liam, I will be interested to see how this does. Lots of this sounds really interesting but it's just not something I'll be rushing out to buy. @LiamCroft does it have performance/quality modes and did you try out invading other players worlds in the protect the loop option?@R1spam There are three different modes: Performance, Quality, and one for Ray Tracing. The game defaults to Performance at 60FPS, while Quality is better visuals but 60FPS with dips. Ray Tracing is 30FPS. I strongly recommend leaving it on the default setting, the game runs very smooth.I didn't get chance to try the invasion mode.@velio84 I didn't have any noticeable frame rate drops while playing on the default setting at 60FPS, but the game did crash back to the PS5 home screen once.Now the reviews are out does that mean we won't get any more trailers?Seeing on N4G quite a few high scores, IGN 10, Gamespot 10, Eurogamer essential, a few other 9's so far.
Couple of sites giving 6's & 7's but it seems to be reviewing well.Last chance today to pre-order with 10% for digital PS5 owners if wavering.This sounds pretty tedious. Don't think I'll bother!@Futureshark Even with the 10% discount it's still about 8 quid dearer than physical.Was sort of expecting this to sweep high scores across the board, it's an Arkane game after all!I'm glad it's getting good reviews but I'll add this to the list of Black Friday games for me, along with Tales of Arise, FarCry 6, Fifa 22 and Nba2k22. You know all of those games are going to be half off in 2 months. My next surefire purchase is Kena Bridge of Spirit's in a few weeks.@LiamCroft Julia? The person/AI hunting you. Given that the game isn't out, was the person hunting you aspect not available? Or were you able to link up with fellow reviewers?How frustrating is that mechanic? Is there an indication on matchmaking so us bad players aren't dropped in with a FPS God?Good to hear! and also not to hear (from the game again)Not a surprise its getting great reviews. The criticism of this game has been bizarre. Will pick up at black friday or somethingthis game is surprisingly getting really really good reviews, however the constant marketing has just killed it for me to enjoy and be surprised@LiamCroft It got 10 from both IGN and Gamespot.Its that good?@The_New_Butler eurogamer gave it a 9 so looks like a good showing all roundVery happy to see its reviewing qell. I pre-ordered day one. The dishonored gameplay, the time loop, setting, i just liked the look of everything from the get go. The biggest relief is that i can turn off the online interruptions. Didnt want that on my first playthrough lol@Bdbrady It was available, I was invaded quite a lot. Mostly by the AI I think. I didn't find it very frustrating at all; to be honest you kind of want it to happen because she drops a lot of good gear.If you're worried about being invaded by better players, though, you can set the game to single player mode and it'll just be the AI controlling Julianna.Glad this is releasing, been waiting on a new, fresh game since Returnal. Man, can't wait to play!I can respect some folks skipping this game if it doesn't appeal to them but you always see people complain about too many remakes, remasters and sequels. Don't think most of those people will buy it, though. They never buy games from Arkane (or Platinum, Housemarque, HAL Labs, Retro, etc).The amount of hype reviews surprising me a bit.Will definitely buy this in a sale in a couple of months. The art style and the idea behind it are cool.Love it when games appear from nowhere. I'll be getting it this weekend.@render just one more “accolades” trailer and we should be free Glad it's getting great reviews - Eurogamer gave it an Essential.Sadly, I can already see salty wounds in the comments section, so I don't expect mass sales on the PlayStation side - despite the fact the game actually seems great!I guess it will be the PC market that drives sales for now until it releases on Xbox.I think I might have to pick this one up, despite owning a Series X and could easily wait for it to inevitably drop on Game Pass. I support great games no matter who publishes them.Has Sony marketed this at all? I don't think I've ever heard of it.@LiamCroft Not sure if this would be a spoiler but does this have an awful cliffhanger like Dishonored? I prefer games with potential for sequels rather than a required sequel. If this is spoilerific though, ignore haha.I'm certainly going to pick this one up! Finally a PS5 title I can get my hands on.Does the AI improve with difficulty settings? i was surpised how good this factor was with the TLOU2..Ps5 secured another console exclusive worth playing..when it comes to gamepass it will be so cheap to get anyway at retail.@CynicalGamer There's no cliffhanger, but I didn't find the ending to be particularly satisfying.This is a psplus/now game for me. Maybe fun but bland af.Rather holding my breath for Sifu. Also sort of a time loop concept and beautiful to see in motion.Best Buy delivered it early and I played it over the weekend. As someone who also thought it was over-advertised, I think the experience of playing it is more than what you get from just watching a trailer. This is a good game.Sitting pretty on Metacritic with 88 (based on 63 reviews). Time to preorder!They've marketed the hell out of this game and yet any potential sequels won't be on PS. It's really hard to be bothered about it despite the very good reviews.@Col_McCafferty Why would your interest in the title be marred by a lack of sequels? The game can be enjoyed as a stand-alone experience, surely.@Voltan I forgot about that one 😂@LiamCroft is there any direct link with dishonored at all for example characters, map, items?@Hootnoodle Outside of a few of the powers being the same, as the review points out, no.Does the game have difficulty settings? Or some sort of replayability? I am definitely getting DeathLoop I liked the look of the game since when they first showed it off, Arkane have made brilliant game's. I own all of their games.@RavenWolfe81 It cracks me up when people complain about a lack of variety in games, and then just....don't buy unique games?Great review. I like Arkane's games but I get burnt out by them halfway through, so I'll probably pick this game up in the future.Ive never given a crap about all the negativity people have for this game. My kids and I have always been somewhat interested and now it’s getting good reviews across the board, I’m preordering it today, especially for that discount.Well I wasn't remotely interested in this, but this morning while sitting in work went on Amazon and pre ordered it. The last few games I did the exact same thing with was days gone, death stranding and ghost of Tsushima, and all 3 of them I have absolutely loved and going by the reviews so far this run might hit again. Can't wait to give it a go tomorrow. Although I still have lots of games I need to finish one day, oh one day I won't have a backlog haha.Not really interested in this game, the more I read the less interested I am, but just wanted to say it was a good and measured review and far better than certain other sites who seem to be going overboard.So many people worried about sequels. Not every game is designed as a franchise to have infinite sequels spun out of it, and built as trilogies from the start. Some games are just a single interesting experience. Heck, that's how the industry always used to be until we started getting safe sequel franchises forever and ever last gen.I tend to think of this as a slightly spiritual successor to an old Bethesda game called Wet that was designed almost entirely like a Tarentino film on purpose. No sequels, no franchise, just a single fun game. This really doesn't sound like it's designed as a franchise/trilogy to me.@Rob_230 I think it's a game that doesn't sell itself, and isn't clear to explain. All the trailers we've seen I never really got a feel for anything of what it's like until the Showcase one the other day, and then this review actually describes it a lot differently than what I thought I saw. I suspect a lot of the criticism was from nobody really having the same idea as everyone else as to what it even is.I went from zero interest to kind of interested with the Showcase, to definitely piqued with this review. I'll be playing on GP eventually, so there's no risk, but I was so disinterested, that I wasn't even going to play it on GP until all this. It definitely comes across better now than what was presented for the past year.Well, half of it is anti-MS fanboying as well...@Acquiescence Be careful what you wish for. That might just mean more time is free to spend on GTAV!Would this have been sold at the PS5 premium game price if the Microsoft deal hadn't gone through?Honestly, the “surprisingly linear” critique is a positive for me. My time is so limited I just don’t have the time to get into these big, experimental games. I need games that say “hey, this is our story. Enjoy the gameplay” lolI just really hate having to repeat doing stuff in games its amechanic that feels like its designed to make a game artificially longer and there for waste my timeRemoved - flaming/arguingPay for it, it's a great success, MS want a sequel/spin off, said game ends up on Game Pass and PS gamers can do one.Yeah, that sounds about right.😝Sequels are an important part of gaming, so are established IP. It's easy for some to demand new IPs and experiences every single time but it's a tad naive to say the least plus at odds with the majority of gamers.@NEStalgia Heck, that's how the industry always used to be until we started getting safe sequel franchises forever and ever last gen.This is not just a gaming thing not a recent thing. Most entertainment industries have been going this path. Books, movies, everything wants to secure productions with sequel potential, not just out of greed, but because fans love sequels.As much as critics and comment posters claim to hate “samey sequels with little innovation” truth is most of us love to have more of the stuff we enjoy, they sell because we buy them. And again, not just games, but books, movies, etc.Will buy it on BF or play on GamePass. The “lack of access to sequels” criticism for PS only players is bizarre, this isn’t a cliffhanger.Will get it when it is in the 50 to 70 % sale not before but it is just not my stile of game them are opinion's and it is mine !strange every review not in the mainstream games media ive seen says not as good as dishonoured or preyGot my preorder today! I've been waiting to play this game since the playstation event in September last year. Quite happy that its getting good reviews all around. Can't wait to give it a spin tonight.I think ill be picking this up soon@tameshiyaku Review - Awesome experimental gameplay loop. Charismatic characters. Slylish visuals.You - bland af.What exactly do you want? What sequel you currently hyped for?And you're in for a long wait for this to hit PSN now/plus darling.Not my cup of tea ,nice thats it getting good reviews though, I liked dishonored but I thought the sequel was a pile of poo,not sure whether arkane did that one though, ill probably play the sequel when its on gamepass 😂@Tharsman It's largely been a recent thing. I know it's not just games. but if we go back 15, 20 years only occasionally did certain things warrant a sequel, or on very special occasions, a trilogy. Excepting those few mega IPs like Star Trek and the like. It's a recent phenomenon that creative industries have become factories of brand products that if it can't be a trilogy it's not worth doing. The idea of a stand-alone creative work is sometimes the most rounded way to portray the work.Imagine if Gone with the Wind required becoming an 8 part franchise, and Scorsese needed to do everything on a 10 year arc.Zero interest, pass. Will likely never come to PS Plus so won't ever touch it.excited to play at midnight!I still have Tales of Arise to play. Although, It's nice to see this game getting good reviews.Is it weird that I didn't want this game anymore after all the non-stop previews? I'll be more interested in this game if maybe there's only 1 or 2 big previews of the game.Arkane game comes out, is good. Some people weirdly surprised.And I have to say I'm so much more bored of seeing people harp on about the marketing campaign than I was for the campaign itself.@NEStalgia Imagine if movies like Alien, Terminator, Predator, Star Wars: A New Hope (it was NOT episode 4 when it first released!), Friday The 13, Nightmare on Elm Street had all never received sequels.Imagine if games like Uncharted, Mario, Zelda, Mega Man, Castlevania, Tomb Rider, Far Cry, Ratchet and Clank (etc etc) never got sequels either because they were all perfect standalone experiences.Honestly, if the consumers want more, the makers want to make more, and the publishers are willing to finance making more, I dont see reason to judge more of any IP being made.At the same time, though, if the devs dont want to make more, I dont see reason to be angry at them for leaving it there and moving on to other things.@Tharsman I don’t think that anyone is concerned about sequels to any of these movies or games that you mentioned.
I guess it’s more about the yearly CoD and fifa releases or remakes/ports for decades (Skyrim, GTA 5).I like what Arkane did here, it’s a cool setting and the game looks like a lot of fun.Not gonna bother with paying more then $20 for something that's definitely gonna be on gamepass in a year though, guess it doesn't grip me nearly enough for that to changePre-ordered this a few days ago! So excited to dig into this. I haven't bought any games since Ratchet and Clank I think, just been waiting for this to come out. LFGGamepass and Zenimax buyout was obviously not in the plans when Sony made the exclusivity deal for this game, so I wonder how it will affect sales (if at all)...Myself I wouldn't have any problem waiting a year to play a game as part of a sub instead - my backlog won't run out anytime soon!The only exceptions being absolute must-have games (From software) or multiplayer titles I want to play before everyone gets too good/familiar with them.The 8 for Push Square is much more convincing to me than a 10 from IGN for me, so thanks for the honest review.Like many others, I have a feeling this will be on a holiday sale, so I’m holding out, but only because I’ve got Eastward and Kena coming so soon (and hopefully they are both strong titles). I’ve always liked Arkane titles, but they’ve always been stop-gap titles for me that I never finish. Given my current pre-order schedule, I’d like to give it (and my other games) a fair shake and hope for that holiday sale while I catch up with my other games.This game sounds interesting. Never heard of it before.@Reeneman at least in this comment section, the topic seems to be ""why would Death Loop need a sequel, why not leave it as a one-shot"".If the devs feel they have more they want to do in the world, and the game performs well, then its perfectly fine for it to get a sequel. I guess that whole line of thought starts from the thought that a sequel, if any, wont ever be released on a PlayStation console.@trev666 Then just don't die then @Tharsman I'm not so much upset that sequels exist. I'm upset at the idea that a project is considered unthinkable if it's not intended for manufactured sequels. People are trashing the game based on the idea they won't get sequels to a game that never said it will have sequels and is very unlikely to have sequels.We stopped making games/movies and started making ""IPs"" - that's what went horribly wrong. A game/film that gets sequels is one thing. But ""IP"" management dictates that everything that exists must be a permanent product line and not an individual product.Edit: I mean, do I want Gravity Rush 10 and Knack 7? Heck yeah. But I'm not going to lament that there's no Last Guardian 2. It doesn't need and shouldn't have a sequel.For this game, having not seen the story or ending yet, obviously, the whole story revolves around a time loop in a single day. By definition ending that time loop should resolve the real purpose of the story being told. Sure you could franchise it and now continue with ""new time loops found"" or the 70's world without a time loop. But if the purpose of the whole theme is the time loop and assuming you resolve the time loop in a game, a sequel would feel shoehorned for the sake of IP management. It seems most likely it was designed as a single outing project. It would not be the first time a Bethesda studio created a game meant to be self contained. Again, Wet is a great example. It was great for what it is, it's memorable for what it is, and it doesn't need to become a factory product with a new version every few years. It was a one and done cult classic masterpiece.@Tharsman a lot of those examples shouldn’t have had sequels to their sequels. Terminator 3, 4, 5 and 6 were terrible. Predator is a great iconic film that didn’t sequels. Star Wars again didn’t need the prequel or sequel trilogy.The consumer and the studio are both to blame for the lack creativity but then who can blame them. They’re stuck in a loop.@NEStalgia For what its worth: Wet was simply published by Bethesda, it was developed and [as far as I understand] owned by Behaviour Interactive (I assume this might be the root of why the game is not being added to XBox One BC.) Bethesda was not even the original publisher, originally it was Vivendi, but its likely that deal fell through during the Activision Blizzard merger.A sequel was actually in the work and publicly announced in 2010 but ended up being canceled.I think this looks brilliant, certainly too good to be able to wait for it to come onto game pass. Very excited for my pre-order arriving tomorrow.You guys are officially the new GameSpot, LMAO XD@Col_McCafferty But how about just enjoying this game on its own? I'm sure if the ending noticeably set things up for a sequal, Liam would have mentioned it. There has certainly been enough people on here moaning about the possibility for it to have registered with him as a concern.@Tharsman Yeah it's technically ""indie"" - and thank goodness that sequel got canned. It's truly a game that stands up best alone. Shame it's not really available anymore for whatever weird licensing reasons. IIRC Behavior wet the bed (pun intended) with the Westworld mobile game as an outright theft of Fallout Shelter and all ties with Bethesda were severed.I'lL pLay it ON gaMEpASs.Surprised this game has been reviewing so strongly, shame it was ruined by the overmarketing from PlayStation.I'll still try the game out but will wait a few years until it's $20 New somewhere.@PossibLeigh I will say the game doesn't set an obvious sequel up whatsoever. It can very much be treated like a one and done game. If there is ever a sequel, they'll like take it in a different direction and Deathloop will be sort of a standalone story. I wouldn't skip it because you think you're going to miss out on some big story-focused franchise in the future.Want a laugh, read the story about this game on PureXbox!Apparently it's the best PS5 'exclusive' or something and it's made by a MS owned studio. Crowing that it's one day going to end up on GP and most on here don't even want to play it!Send it to GP now, nobody will give a *****.I was on the fence for this game, but this review convinced me to pick it up. A lot of things people may see as negatives such as, linearity and it only being 12-15 hours, is a huge plus for me. It sounds like it’s doing a lot of unique things too.Looks like Bioshock enemies meets dishonored powers with a Rogue-Lite aspect. It seems to be trying too hard to be several things.Why does everyone care about sequals? Prey was an amazing game and we have no second for that. Just play and enjoy.@Col_McCafferty “ Want a laugh, read the story about this game on PureXbox!”Fanboys are the worst. I’m so glad there aren’t people like that on this site.Ive got it installed and am really looking forward to it now. Only 52 minutes left...Don't know if I should be glad this is another hit from Arkane or sad there'd be no more Arkane games on PS...@Bleachedsmiles as I previously said, Sifu looks like it has similar gameplay mechanics, it's not a sequel (!), made by a small studio with less of a ad budget than deathloop. Who knows, maybe it'll be great, maybe not, but it's got me more excited than any of deathloops countless trailers and deep dives have.I played Dishonored and prey based on their accolades and walked away severely underwhelmed, with plot twists you could see miles away, and gameplay that has been done before and better from the likes of Deus Ex and system shock.Deathloop may exist and I'm glad for people who enjoy it. I'm just glad it's out that it doesn't get any more screentime.@tameshiyaku I don't care if the games for you or not... I'm more interested in commenting on a review that talks about it being experimental (which I presume means it's something new, or refreshing)...you tell us it's bland AF. Something doesn't go hand in hand...you know?Removed - trolling; user is banned@Hypnotoad107 @Hypnotoad107 Lol. What comment section have you been reading?@LiamCroft Thanks for the extra info, Liam. Hopefully this assuages the worries of those concerned about a sequal.I guess I was proven wrong in a good way so I'll gladly hold this L.@LiamCroft can you chose to keep the rival assassin as an AI or is it random? Also is the game online only? I can’t find these answers anywhere. Thanks!I read and watched a lot of reviews last night. A consensus is emerging of a far from perfect game, but a great game none the less. A deserving 8 out of 10.I am surprised at a number of big sites seemingly not noticing the issues and handing out glowing 10’s.Sure 10 doesn’t mean it’s perfect, but this is Ocarina, TLoU, GTA and RDR territory. This game certainly don’t look in that league chief.So what’s up in the games journalism industry that these big commercial sites are handing out these staggering reviews?!?I’d like to know what is going on, and wonder if it will ever come out…Difficult position on this one.On the one hand I LOVE Arkane and want to support them directly.On the other I have a huge backlog (just getting round to Ghost of Tsushima and Psychonauts 1!!!), but mostly I have Game Pass for the next 3 years. Included for no extra or £60?Will likely wait for Game Pass tbh. It’ll be fully patched by then and likely have something to make it ‘play best on Xbox’ as is their mantra.Hope it does well for Arkane both now and in a year on GP.@Toypop I agree there is a bit of a consensus in the middle around 8 or 9/10 (It's 88 on Metacritic) BUT there’s also some division. It’s probably the most divisive game Arkane have made. [EDIT: It isn't! looking back this is standard for all Arkane games, which are pretty niche]On one side it seems if the game really grips you it will be one of your favourite games of the year and truly memorable. Tamoor Hussain (who loves Souls, MGS, Mass effect) gave it a ten and talked about it strongly in these terms. Genre defining, boundary pushing, memorable etc. It doesn't have to be 'perfect' to get a 10/10.Then there’s also a crowd giving it 6 or 7 out of 10, or not recommending it, because it didn’t gel with them. ACG who I usually really like didn’t vibe with it and gave it a ‘wait for a sale’.For me the reviewers who love it are mostly the ones I usually see eye to eye with so it’s more likely to be an 9 or 10 for me. There are no wrong answers, just opinions, and this is quite a niche game hence the range of scores. Personally I’m excited for it in due course@Bleachedsmiles apparently you care a lot. If you actually read the review it's ""experimental"" in regards to how to tackle your goal (like hitman, Deus ex, and past arkane games... so nothing new). Opinions don't always align, deal with it.@tameshiyaku I don't think you understand what 'bland' means.@Hypnotoad107 🤣🤣🤣@Waffles12415 If you choose single player mode, the invader will always be controlled by the AI. And yes, you can play offline.This review is receiving more comments than the 3 Dishonored games and Prey combined. And mainly because of the PS5 exclusivity affair.Arkane Studios definitely deserve more love.The premise is awesome and I’d love to want to play it but FPS just don’t do it for me.@andreoni79 Dishonoured and Prey? I didn’t realise it was that studio 😅 muust resist until discount ..I was waiting on the Metacritic score before pre-ordering (to get that sweet sweet PS+ discount), and MAN OH MAN this is a good looking game. I've only been able to play a bit this morning before work, but it makes me genuinely sooo excited for other games that are built specifically for PS5 / that don't have a PS4 version. I'm sure GOW and HFW will both look great still, but the NEXT one, without having to consider the PS4, are going to look absolutely out of hand.they have very much used the prey dlc as a template for this game@andreoni79 I still have Dishonored 2 in my backlog (and Prey too), and playing this makes me real stoked to finally play those. The studio is truly great. Depending on what they keep putting out, it might push me over the edge to get a Series X (although probably at the end of the generation). Their games are just so unique.@Hypnotoad107 oooooohhhh boooooyyyy shots fired lolololol 😂😂😂Thanks for the laugh!@Bleachedsmiles cutePlayed the first few hours and really enjoying it so far. Runs great, good atmosphere and nice sense of humour. Yeah I could of waited a year and got it on gamepass but life's to short. Plus they have really done a great job with the dualsense, really adds to the game.Still waiting for my...F*CKING PRE-ORDER !!!It seems that the negativity around this probably just due to overexposure. I love most of Arkane's previous output so will probably get this at some. Probably on Xbox though so I can have the entire series on one platform. I'm assuming there'll be a sequel.YES BETHESDA..YES. another masterpiece just few months after Doom eternal@Hypnotoad107 Sarcasm font detected. Lol.@FatalBubbles And here I worried I was being to subtle 🙃Might've got it if it was on PS4 ... Oh well@themightyant Yeah I tend to mostly agree with IGN's scores, they are usually generous and recognise there's a lot of great games out there which aren't perfect but still deserve a 10. I'm not really liking PushSquare's scores tbh. @Toypop they're just telling you there's enough room at the top for a lot of games deserving a 10 and rightly so because there'd never be a perfect game.@Would_you_kindly Here's hoping it comes to PS4. But it's more worrying wondering if all of Arkane's games would never come to PlayStation anymore.Could this have been a PS4 game? Visually it doesn't look like a major jump in quality but I don't know if complex AI behaviors and timing mechanics would be overly taxing.@TheArt Tamoor's review is actually GameSpot not IGN but regardless it doesn't matter. I like finding reviewers I vibe with rather than publications. Tamoor loves the same games I like and writes well and with passion. Hence I look out for his reviews. SkillUp (youtube) I like even more as a writer too but don't always agree with on games I like.Similarly there are some reviewers that when they hate a game I sometimes think ""I might like that"" Yes it is an absolute shame, and a sad reality, that for the foreseeable future Arkane games will not be coming to PlayStation, just as Insomniac games will not go to Xbox. I have both systems but for the majority of PS owners this is not good just as Xbox owners miss out on Insomniac's great titles. Sad.Started this yesterday and definitely was not expecting it to be so much stealth. My understanding was it was more or less a shooter. So far, if you want to get into a shootout you’re as good as dead. I have to say I’m disappointed in the game so far. I’m about 2 hours in, maybe that will change.Can you someone explain why this wouldn’t play brilliantly on PS4? Ok we’ve had the woeful unforgettable launch of Cyberpunk 2077, which will go down in history as the biggest disappointment in gaming like ever but how can you compare Cyberpunk to this? The reviews I’ve seen are quite cartoony, and to be honest I look at this and think, what about Death Stranding, all Assassins Creed games, Orgins, Odyssey and now Valhalla, Red Dead Redemption 2, amongst other great and epic games, they are all big sized games with awesome amazing graphics and really use the PS4 to the max with no problems, so begs the question why hasn’t this come out with PS4 as well as PS5?@andy24king It probably saved development time not to have to optimise for last-gen. I don't see why they couldn't bring out a last-gen port later though.@themightyant I think I like Arkane's games better than Insomniac's though imo.@andy24king It's definitely playable on PS4. Sony just wanted this game to be a system seller but since they can't meet demand in these times, it'd be wise of them to bring it to PS4.The female lead looks way cooler. But i should not be complaining because im not buying it to many great games and we will never will see the sequel anyway.@TheArt Personally I prefer Arkane to Insomniac too, but they are FAR more niche... it's just a niche i'm into!Industry leading level design and emergent gameplay that allows for huge replayability for me. But there is no way Arkane games are more popular than Insomniac's in the wider community.What got me to buy this was the hype and the reviews. But after playing and beating both endings if its even called that and did so in one day, is why its getting these great reviews, knowing the game isn't no where near what its being made into, so i wonder if Microsoft isn't throwing cash out to these reviewers. Because this game isn't even in great game territory, let alone Goty status its being hailed. Plus its so bad its no where near the price point they are charging. Add in bugs and just how quick the game ends once you figure out what the game shows you while guiding you through the small areas. I have heard its not a mindless shooter, it can't get anymore not mindless shooter. Just glad Sony refunded my money and apologized and said its in worse shape than cyber punk, so that should speak volumes.@Paultall Almost had me fooled until you said Sony offered a refund 🤣HDR is broken, it's way to dark and they left out any calibration other than brightness. Seems like it was slighty rushed, it's pretty buggy for me as well, only 5 hours in and already had 3 lock ups and had to exit game to fix.
Apart from that I would probably give it a 7, it's very polished and stylised but doesn't have the substance of prey or dishonoured. There is too little to do in the maps and not enough of them. The time doesn't really change that much, 4 maps is 4 maps and they aren't that big either with hardly anything interactable.@andy24king . It runs very poorly already on ps5 so I think they just didn't have enough time, and it seems very rushed for Arkane, the maps are no where near as well designed as dishonoured 2 and Prey, to me it seems like a big rush job. Plus Sony wanted a system seller, so PS4 was not even in scope for them.
On a side note Not sure how anyone with some integrity could score it a 10.It's hard to tell if this game deserves the 9s and 10s it's getting from major reviewers or if it's receiving those reviews because there are so few PS5 games in the catalog at this point that reviewers feel the need to say that something is worth playing. PS5 is off to an unprecedentedly slow start and I can't help but wonder if this game had been released in the middle of PS4's lifecycle when so many great games were being released, would it still really be considered a 10?I'm not very far in but so far - it's been a blast !Terrific stuff.I have beaten it, and I completely understand why it being really linear is a con. Simply, the game boils down to collecting enough information to put more waypoints on your screen.The only time you really have any freedom is at the party when killing Alexis, as there are a few ways to narrow down your search, and one way to kill him by not using weapons. I guess killing Fia and Charlie maybe, but I'd hardly call that freedom either.Really disappointing to be honest. It sucks how static the Visionaries are baring Alexis, and MAYBE Fia (but the game is so easy, and the AI is so bad you actually have to try to get her to blow up the reactor.)Still it's pretty good. Definitely like the game, and Multiplayer is very unique and fun too. I consider it to be better than Dishonored (Hated it. Overrated as hell) and Prey (that was alright).theres something up with the high review scores of this game its ok but not as good as Arkanes previous games which got lower scoresive realised that the only logical reason why gamespot and ign scored it so highly is that they are trying to reward games that are not cookie cutter games that take a risk so studios like Arkane (who deserve it) can get funding to make other games. but this game is just very average and only a 7 or 8 at best. its very shallow after the honey moon first few hours when the shine wears off and you are left with a world that only has 4 maps and hardly anything to do in them. no way you can give this game a 10 realistically, that is just crazy talk. Shine and coolness don't make a whole gaming experience, its like playing a game from the 90's with 2021 graphics and production budgets.Its like Arkane dumbed them selves down and rushed out a game just because Sony probably paid them mega bucks, its kind of a sell out and i will be cautious with any of their future games now and probably buy second hand .

Deathloop,John-Paul Jones,PlayStation Universe,https://www.psu.com/reviews/deathloop-review-ps5/," John-Paul Jones / September 13, 2021Deathloop PS5 review. Emerging from the same endlessly talented hands and minds that gave us the Dishonored franchise and with the still lofty capabilities of the PlayStation 5 at their disposal, we should have expected just how good Deathloop was going to be. However, what perhaps came as something of a surprise was the fact that Deathloop isn’t just the best game that Arkane have ever created, but also a devastatingly clever and evocative masterwork that leverages the capabilities of Sony’s latest silicon in ways that cement its status as a defining offering for this console generation.This is no mere hyperbole; Deathloop is absolutely f**king great and without a shadow of a doubt the single most essential title you can buy for PlayStation 5 right now.Though the countless trailers and spot videos have repeatedly rammed home the blunt point that Deathloop is perhaps somewhat reductively, ‘Groundhog Day with assassins’ within an FPS template, it has now become clear that Arkane has held so much back from the public eye that it’s something of a surprise that much of what makes Deathloop tick has not been leaked.Without giving away the entire setting of Deathloop’s narrative premise, the setup is this – players control Colt, a former head of security turned assassin who finds himself waking up on a beach each time he dies, doomed to repeat that same day each time. Certainly, Deathloop wastes no time in initiating players into such proceedings either, as the first few seconds of the game have Colt being murdered by Julianna, another assassin, which naturally kicks off the whole ‘Deathloop’, if you’ll excuse the lazy pun.As it turns out, this time-looping phenomenon seems to be the exclusive domain of the island of Blackreef, an ultra-hedonistic retreat where decadence is eternal and the inhabitants can literally do whatever they like safe in the knowledge that the day will just restart itself again and all their sins will be erased. Julianna, the assassin whose sole purpose is to maintain the status quo of Blackreef, has taken it upon herself to kill Colt at every turn in order to prevent him from acquiring the knowledge needed to break the loop. As such, while Blackreef might seem like freedom for everyone else, for Colt it’s his prison and Julianna is his jailer.As Colt, players begin every day the same – washed up and cussing fire on the Blackreef coast, looking for a way to make sense of everything while also trying to ascertain just how to break the loop and escape. The goal, chiefly, is to track down each of the eight ‘Visionaries’ that hold sway over the island, kill them, take their powers and then attempt to break the titular Deathloop. This being an Arkane game of course, the manner in which you go about doing this is not prescribed in the least and it’s up to you to find your own way to kill each mark. Make no mistake, the developers of Deathloop are clever folks and they think you are too.Whether that’s going straight into an encounter all-guns blazing, creeping up on your target via a secret route or somehow convincing their own underlings to kill then, the pleasing array of methods at your disposal for offing each of the Visionaries is broad, creative and staunchly satisfying. However, if you die you’ll lose all the gear that you have on your person – until, well, you discover how not to.Certainly fans of Dishonored will find much of Deathloop’s design to be functionally adjacent, in that Colt can traverse the Deathloop’s vertically expansive environments at great speed, leap off walls, sneak through tunnels, stealth-murder at leisure and generally turn the island of Blackreef into your own personal murder, death, kill playground as you see fit. Also like Dishonored and BioShock before it, Deathloop also provides players with the necessary tools and creative latitude to hack terminals, alarm systems and turn turrets against their masters with Colt’s super handy Hackamjig tool that does exactly what it says on the tin.However, whereas other games that boast similar concepts such as Hitman and even Arkane’s own Dishonored games merely prescribe a set of alternative routes, in Deathloop the manipulation of time is brought to bear here, adding layers of sophistication and genuinely ingenious design that none of those games could ever hope to match. Rather than the Hitman and the Dishonored games, Deathloop allows access to different locations or districts as they’re called on the island of Blackreef – allowing players to go to and from each location as they please. The kicker here however, is that each time you travel from one location to the next, time moves on and so too does the weather and the events that are taking place throughout the island.Arkane makes tremendously clever use of this concept as you might expect. You see, each time you die – either by misadventure or when the day ends, and reawaken on that cursed beach, you do so with all of the knowledge that you have accumulated to that point. This means that if in a previous loop you discovered that someone was going to steal an item that you needed in the afternoon, you could travel to that place in the morning and nab it first.Likewise, you might come across two denizens of Blackreef (or ‘Eternalists’, as they’re called), chipping away at a wall in search of treasure. Rather than just hopping from one location to the next in order to drive time forward, you have the option to just wait and advance time that way, meaning that when you return to that same location later and it turns out they’ve succeeded in their task, you can take the loot for yourself. Wielding time in a manner that is both entertaining and coherent has long proven to be an almost insurmountable task for films (hey, Terminator movies) and games alike, but in Deathloop developer Arkane does so effortlessly and with complete confidence, as the ability to use time in this way adds layers to an already deep explorative shooter experience.The fluctuating weather also directly impacts the geography and traversal possibilities of each location too. From the towering walls of the Complex, to the hustle and bustle of town centre Updaam, new paths become available and old ones are closed off in turn, proffering yet another reason why Deathloop succeeds as well as it does when wielding time manipulation in a way that’s both easy to grasp and is immensely compelling. Likewise, returning to some districts at night results in far more capable enemies joining the fray, providing yet another variable for you to plan for.Where Deathloop excels even further, is that there are no shortage of incentives to travel to the various districts on Blackreef at different times of the day beyond what the main story prescribes. When each Visionary is killed they drop a Slab, a special item that imbues the owner with a special power such as teleportation, invisibility or chain kill that allows you to link a number of enemies together and then when you kill one, that same fate is endured by each connected foe. Even better still, the same slab can be upgraded multiple times by resetting the loop and killing its original owner over and over. It’s clever stuff, for sure.Though Colt begins with the handy Reprise Slab which allows him to die twice before the loop restarts, there is always an incentive to seek out new and exciting powers and in that respect Deathloop never fails to keep the player amply incentivised. Crammed into the numerous safes, puzzle boxes, deposit boxes, crates and secret locations that are generously stuffed throughout the domain of Blackreef, Colt can scoop up all manner of upgrades and special items that can boost his abilities. Again, it’s a similar design bedrock to that seen in games such as Dishonored, Deus Ex and BioShock, so fans of those classics will find much to love here.Speaking of power, a range of Trinkets provide amplification to wide array of skills and abilities; including everything from double jumps to reducing recoil and much more besides, with a subset of these trinkets able to be slotted into your weapons. Elsewhere, the weapons in Deathloop are graded by colour in a manner similar to the Borderlands games with the higher quality weapons being capable of dishing out more damage and using extra trinket slots. It’s not a ground-breaking feature by any means, but it makes sense to have a grading system such as this to reward players with better quality weapons as they progress to later loops.As Colt travels from one district to another, players are given respite by Deathloop’s loadout screen. Here, players aren’t just able to ponder over the leads that they want to chase, but they can also equip the various firearms, trinkets and upgrades that they want to take with them on their next sojourn into Blackreef. The flipside of this loadout mechanism however, is that there is no way to equip any of these new trinkets and items during your time on Blackreef, meaning that, as with so many other aspects of Deathloop, you need to give a great deal of thought as to the gear that you’ll be taking with you into the districts.Going back once more to a point comparison with the Dishonored games, Deathloop also does a sublime job of encouraging you to fully explore the world and unearth the veritable smorgasbord of secrets that lay within. Safe codes are written on notes, key combinations are hidden in visual puzzles and other brain testing conundrums will reward fancy items and upgrades when resolved. Basically, if you’ve a nose for sniffing out secrets and loot in the Dishonored games, it’ll serve you more than well in Deathloop.Then there’s Julianna, Deathloop’s seemingly omnipresent assassin. An always threatening presence, Julianna can invade your game as she attempts to put an end to your life and thus reset the loop. Of course you can turn the tables on Julianna by killing her and taking her Slab, though this is much easier said then done and especially if Julianna is being controlled by a human player – a notion that Dark Souls players will almost certainly be familiar with.Once you’ve reached a certain point in Colt’s campaign to break the loop, you gain the ability to play as Julianna to maintain it. When playing as Julianna, Deathloop becomes yet more compelling still in a number of brilliant and unexpected ways. Much, much more than just a trivial afterthought, Julianna has her own skills, trinkets, weapons and abilities that make controlling her a freshly different proposition from playing as Colt. There’s real incentive to play as Julianna and spoil someone’s day too, as succeeding in doing so awards abilities and additional skills that can be used to make future incursions much more deadly.More than any of that though, playing as Julianna against a skilled Colt player (and vice-versa), is its own reward. Clashes between two skilled ‘loopers’ are often spectacular affairs as players use mines, traps and all manner of firearms and special abilities at their disposal to get the upper hand. Certainly, after the impressive depths of the single-player campaign have been plumbed, endlessly entertaining clashes between players as Colt and Julianna respectively will likely bear out for many weeks and months later, as the island of Blackreef provides a peerless theatre for such innovative and enduring violence.While the struggle to unravel the timeloop and all of the machinations involved with that is hugely compelling sci-fi stuff, it wouldn’t land not nearly as effectively as it does if it wasn’t for the evocative setting, compelling characters and superb world building that Arkane has accomplished. For a start, Colt is an actual personality with a sort of goofy, laugh out loud charisma that feels a world away from the mute likes of Corvo and the grim, po-faced nature of Billie Lurk. Equally, Julianna proves the appropriate yin to Colt’s yang, with razor-tongued, quick-witted comebacks that continually needle the player through the duration of Colt’s campaign.The world of Blackreef is an evocative one to say the least. A lively and colorful composite of 60s and 70s retro influences that crib from the likes of Nobody Lives Forever and A Clockwork Orange, Deathloop’s vibrant hedonistic getaway is a distinct departure from the grime ands grey of Dishonored’s Dunwall and is a revelation in doing so. Likewise, the denizens of Blackreef are a stylish lot too, adorned in fashions that look like a crazy mix of alternative dress and impeccable Jean-Paul Gaultier style esoterism.If the folks of Blackreef are as distinct from those seen in other games on the surface, so too is that the case for their behaviour. Much more than just a bunch of random goons, the cultists of hedonism that have made Blackreef their home can be found doing all sorts of crazy stuff. Whether they’re dangling themselves over a pier edge, doing enough drugs that they can’t stand up straight, or attempting to shoulder press a propane cannister, it’s certainly fair to say that these Eternalists are a refreshing bunch that only add to the wonderful oddness of Deathloop’s world.As a PlayStation 5 title, Deathloop makes ample use of the capabilities of Sony’s latest console to say the least. Fidelity, performance and ray tracing modes provide players with the expected trade off between framerate and visual detail as required, though arguably its the performance mode in which Deathloop plays the best, as the smooth framerate and insignificant drop in visual detail make the game run at its smoothest and by proxy, most satisfying clip.Further afield, the DualSense controller is leveraged to incredible effect and in perhaps in a fashion that is superior to any other PlayStation 5 title to date. The haptic feedback is wonderfully palpable, rattling along with aplomb as you unleash on enemies with automatic firearms. Then there’s the adaptive triggers which not only provide expected palpable resistance, but also provide a surprising amount of stiffness when your weapon jams which is not only scary from a gameplay perspective, but is exacerbated by the sensations that the adaptive triggers provide. Quite simply, Deathloop is a perfect showcase for the PlayStation 5 and feels ‘next-gen’ in ways that transcend the potent hardware that purrs underneath the console’s stylish chassis.As seemingly the last game to be developed for PlayStation platforms by Arkane, Deathloop’s well earned position at the very apex of what Sony’s current generation console can offer feels somewhat bittersweet. As swansongs and teary send offs go, Deathloop is right up there with the very best and effortlessly cements itself as a defining offering for this console generation that will be talked about and held in reverie for months and years to come – a brave new benchmark for first-person shooters everywhere going forward.Review code kindly provided by PR.Deathloop releases for PS5 on September 14, 2021.Deathloop is not only one of the most conceptually ambitious and well executed games ever made, but Arkane's PlayStation swansong also has a boundless energy and ingenuity that no other game can match. Quite simply, Deathloop is an unparalleled synergy of first-person shooter design, explorative bliss and narrative complexity that we likely won't see again for a very, very long time.

Deathloop,Justin Clark,Slant Magazine,https://www.slantmagazine.com/games/deathloop-review/,"Deathloop brings a considerable measure of liveliness to the by now moth-eaten concept of the time loop.Arkane Studios’s Deathloop brings a considerable measure of liveliness to the by now moth-eaten concept of the time loop. The game doesn’t lack for tipsy gallows humor, and just about every component of it is brimming with personality, from the kitschy late-’60s aesthetic, to its blaxploitation-inspired protagonist, to the wacky menagerie of mad scientists and amoral lunatics known as the Visionaries that run the ill-fated island of Blackreef. And the icing on the cake is the perpetually pissed-off main antagonist, Julianna Blake, an awesomely invasive presence throughout and a too-rare example of a well-realized black female playable character. But it’s precisely because Deathloop is so surprising in its brio that it may leave you wishing that it had brought just a little more to the table.Our hero, Colt Vahn, wakes up on Blackreef with no memory, but he quickly realizes that everyone else on the Arctic island is trying to kill him, and that the one person willing to talk to him directly is Julianna, who seems to hate Colt with a nuclear fury. Worse, though, is that the island is stuck in a time loop, where the day resets either in the evening or after Colt is killed. But even worse is that Julianna is immune to the loop’s repeating cycle, and so she spends her infinite days waiting for Colt to remember exactly why she hates him so much, staving off boredom by occasionally finding new and creative ways to kill him.An inferior version of Deathloop might have limited Colt’s options as he goes about picking up clues and listening to audio logs in order to piece together the mystery of why he’s stuck reliving the same day over and over. But it quickly becomes clear, as he listens to conversations in progress, finds odd places to hide, hacks computers, and uses the information at his disposal to confront the Visionaries, that the game’s approach to exploration isn’t so obvious.The first hours of Deathloop play out as a Happy Death Day-like murder mystery where weaponry is less valuable to the player than all that information that you have to gather, and which you have to piece together in a way that will lead Colt to where he has to go. And once it becomes obvious that all eight of the Visionaries, including Julianna, must die, Deathloop reveals itself as a wild interpolation of Mega Man, with Colt needing to figure out the most efficient order in which to execute these individuals within the course of a day, and still get to the massive device holding him temporally hostage before everything resets.Getting the kill isn’t the thrill here. Rather, it’s the maneuvering that you have to do around Blackreef in order to get the job done with maximum efficiency before the day resets. And good luck doing so with Julianna constantly nipping at your heels, and in truly unpredictable ways, as Deathloop’s stroke of genius is how it turns her pervasive threat into a multiplayer option, with players being able to start the game as Julianna and invade other people’s gameplay sessions, Dark Souls-style, hunting Colt down while he’s on assassination duty.But the online multiplayer’s narrative-interrupting function is more or less where Deathloop’s innovation ends. While your ultimate goals in the game are intriguingly realized, the tools to achieve them are straight out of the Dishonored playbook. While an emphasis solely on exploration would’ve been too little to satisfy what this game sets up, the same kind of careful stealth action that defines Prey and Dishonored is also insufficient. In the end, Deathloop suffers from the same design flaw as those other games, in that you’re encouraged to come up with your own approach to every problem, but your player character is so frail for such a long stretch of the campaign that it’s obvious that the correct approach is the quieter one.There are moments where the elements repurposed from Dishonored feel as if they’re working toward advancing something new. In particular, a party at one of the Visionaries’ mansions turns into something resembling a super-powered Hitman level as it drags on, encouraging your creativity while also meshing well with the larger task at hand, since you had to find a way to get multiple targets to the party earlier in the day. But such moments are uncommon. Because regardless of how powerful you are, or the guns and superpowers that you acquire across the campaign, the extent to which you’re allowed to come up with your own approach to a problem narrows the more you realize how each Visionary moves throughout their day, the least invasive way to take them out, and what powers will allow you to do it efficiently.By that point, using one or two of the heavy assault rifles and shotguns that you find to slay your way into a building and get your information may end up being your preferred approach. It’s worth noting that the main mechanical difference between Deathloop and Dishonored is that you can kill without moral consequence here. That’s liberating, but while it’s nice, and hilarious, that kicking enemies into the ocean is such a key part of Deathloop’s gameplay, there isn’t a whole lot that’s interesting about that. For a stealthy FPS that prides itself on the steady accumulation of power and understanding, the game also rarely makes either one feel particularly exhilarating. But, in the end, Deathloop’s almost perversely ironic saving grace is that it’s populated with charismatic weirdos who are just as irked about that as you are.The game was reviewed using a code provided by fortyseven communications.Justin Clark is a gaming critic based out of Massachusetts.

Deathloop,Christopher Byrd,Washington Post,https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2021/09/24/deathloop-its-campy-mechanics-are-good-nothing-more-than-that/,"This article was published more than 1 year agoDeathloopDeveloped by: Arkane StudiosPublished by: Bethesda SoftworksAvailable on: PC, PlayStation 5It might sound odd, but I thought of Susan Sontag as I tried to pin down the aesthetic that lies at the heart of “Deathloop,” the new action game about Colt, a guy caught in a time loop on an island populated by masked revelers who have no compunction about shooting him on sight. In her seminal essay “Notes on Camp” Sontag wrote, “Camp is a vision of the world in terms of style — but a particular kind of style. It is the love of the exaggerated …”“Camp” strikes me as a useful word to describe a game where one’s adversaries include Charlie, a techie, who underwent a voluntary lobotomy to furnish the computer he uses with biological material to enhance its computational power, and his lover Fia, an artist who sets up residence inside an active nuclear reactor where she paints over the instrumental doodads. “Deathloop” is keen to remind you of its video gameness. It celebrates its own artifice. It wallows in its own style. Its characters are merrily outlandish and the situation they find themselves in, of repeating the same day, killing and dying, is an obvious nod to players accustomed to repetition.A recent article on Game Developer about “Deathloop’s” sound design opened with this observation: “Deathloop's aesthetic can't be summed up in a tidy buzzword. Even 'retro-future' doesn't quite hack it. Yet, despite its lack of conciseness, the 1960s- and '70s-inspired sandbox shooter[ …] has a vibe that simply works.” I agree. It’s best not to make too much of the mid-twentieth century iconography that runs through the game (tube TVs, radio technology, etc.) or other anachronistic features (the personal computers scattered over the island, for example). Deathloop doesn’t feel anchored in a historical period as much as it feels steeped in the conventions of modern (e.g. post-“Dark Souls”) video games.At the start of “Deathloop,” Colt finds himself on the wrong end of a machete pointed at his chest. Holding the weapon over him asking “Why can’t you remember!?,” is Julianna, a woman who savors taunting Colt throughout his journey. Julianna barely lets him plead his ignorance before stabbing him in the chest. The scene then cuts to the early morning where Colt wakes up amid several empty bottles on a beach. Standing up and making his way inland, he sees messages written in white letters hanging in the air in front of him, “break the loop,” then soon after, “who are you?” Making his way to a metal door fixed along a rocky cliffside, he opens it, heads down a flight of steps and sees another message hanging in the air, “it’s me, I’m you.” The short passageway opens to another room where, positioned over a desk, is a map with notes and pictures tacked on to it.The room jogs his memory. On the board are notes about the island’s resident Visionaries, the people whose presence sustain the time loop. Part of the backstory players are left to find out is how these luminaries from different fields — art, science, music, and business — came to work for a company in the business of enticing folks to take vacations where they can live out their fantasies with the assurance that “time is your plaything.” As players progress through the campaign they’ll discover a web of interconnections between the Visionaries that Colt must exploit to sabotage the loop.Sections of the island of Blackreef can be explored at set times: morning, noon, afternoon and evening. If Colt dies more than two times during one of his expeditions, the time loop resets and he finds himself back on the beach in the morning. Early in the game Colt loses the gear he finds when the time loop resets. Eventually he learns how to “infuse” weapons and assorted upgrades with “residuum,” or energy, that can be harvested from dead enemies and objects littered throughout the environment. Infusion, which can be performed in between missions, allows Colt to retain his gear across different time loops. Residuum works in a manner similar to how souls work in the Dark Souls series. If Colt dies, he drops his residuum where he fell. Players then have the opportunity to revisit the spot where Colt met his end and reclaim the residuum, which disappears if the time loop resets.Another way in which “Deathloop” borrows from the Souls series is by allowing for player invasions. Players can assume the role of Julianna and invade the world of other Colts. When played offline, a computer-controlled Julianna will sometimes try to hunt down Colt should he be detected by adversaries in an area in which a Visionary lives.Created by the studio best known for its Dishonored franchise, “Deathloop,” is a systems-heavy game that offers players a variety of tools to accomplish its objectives. Different character builds are ideal for stealth, hacking or brute force. One of my favorite ways to go about things is to grab a turret (which can be folded up and carried like a briefcase) turn briefly invisible using the “aether” powerup that Colt can acquire from one of the Visionaries, mosey over to a group of enemies, setup the turret and skedaddle. Chalk it up to the voyeur in me but I’ve long relished inflicting carnage on video game characters from the sidelines.I extracted only modest pleasure from “Deathloop.” Sure, I experienced some tense moments when I was down to one life and struggled getting to the exit of a level, but that sort of tension is something I’ve long grown accustomed to from any number of games. Moreover, the twists in the game’s story line did little for me. I never felt any urgency to break the time loop since everyone in the world — even Colt — is pretty blithe about going through the motions from one loop to the next. Alas, I find it difficult to imagine anyone who isn’t partial to video game tropes loving “Deathloop.” Unless you’re particularly drawn to its vibe, it’s a shooter with good mechanics but not much more than that.Christopher Byrd is a Brooklyn-based writer.
