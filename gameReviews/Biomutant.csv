Link: Official site Biomutant is a boring game that survives on charm. What other open world game stars a bipedal mutant cat-thing that specializes in martial arts? This is an RPG in which you can leap from your grotesque, grinning horse, summon a ball of mucus around yourself to roll up your enemies like ants on a moist jawbreaker, 'detonate' the mucus to send them flying, and finish with a slow-motion Max Payne-esque volley of electric bullets from a gun with a trumpet horn for a muzzle. It's tragic, then, that hollow progression and an incessant narrator suck out so much of the joy in Biomutant. Biomutant feels like it's going to be much more, but in practice it's an endless stream of new ideas that go nowhere and beautiful, toxic landscapes with little to offer except an excuse to use photo mode. (I'm at 127 screenshots and counting.) It's especially disappointing because Biomutant's nonchalant, optimistic vision of the post-apocalypse is a refreshing take on the end times, with a weasel dressed like Elvis for every fascist cannibal emperor in Fallout. But if you strip out the gangly, affable muppets, all that's left is a broken open world RPG with little else to discover except another cheap riff on the same color-matching puzzle, plastered over a rotary phone or microwave or whatever. At least it looks amazing. Biomutant's human-free post-apocalypse is both stern and sweet. It imagines the worst case scenario for mankind: total eradication from pollution, late-late-capitalist greed and exploitation, war—it's a who's who of the biggest bummers. But it also depicts a vibrant world teeming with life after we're gone. Even though there's another apocalypse on the way, it's embraced with curiosity and inevitability by most of earth's future fur citizens, from a hulking chef who only aspires to make the tastiest food possible to a mousy fashionista who wants everyone to dress how they feel before the earth implodes. Aww. I respect stories that give the void a warm hug, so I'm surprised how much the narration and writing made me wish Biomutant's world ended yesterday. David Shaw Parker's performance as the omnipotent narrator isn't bad, but his saccharine tone clashes with the fragmented English in the writing, which is often embarrassingly twee. I never want to hear a Shakespearian voice describe piss and shit as ""yellow juice"" and ""brown bobs"" ever, ever again. If I couldn't slam spacebar to move things along, Biomutant would be made irredeemable by the narration aloneThe way it's paced prolongs the pain, every conversation opening with a few seconds of cute mutant gibberish, after which Parker reads the text I've already skimmed in the same indulgent full-throated tone and primitive syntax, no matter the context. Simple sentences take a couple seconds to decrypt because every other word is replaced with a complicated compound. ""That's a Pling-plong-booth from the by-gone, back when you needed to cable words via buzz-wire instead of air-waving them"" instead of 'People used to stand in boxes to talk'. When Parker reads these lines aloud I feel like I'm being mocked. It's unbearable.The characters don't help. They're written more like fuzzy parables than three-dimensional fur-people. Cute glimpses of their personal lives are interrupted by long-winded lectures on morality, intercut with your character's inner monologue, all narrated by Shaw. If I couldn't slam spacebar to move things along, Biomutant would be made irredeemable by the narration alone. It's a case of subtraction by addition, a performance that washes over and homogenizes the impressive breadth and creativity in the mutant models, and glazes over their surface level allegory with lethal levels of pomp and circumstance. Biomutant's beautiful world is much better off speaking for itself, from a distance at least. 7 tips for getting the most out of Biomutant
Biomutant's pesky narrator can now be turned offIt's easy to see why Biomutant draws so many The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild comparisons. There's my little ferret guy coasting through the air on a paraglider, the gnarled roots of the Tree of Life spiraling off in every direction, grassy knolls cut through with rivers and roads, an old highway crumbling above it all. Orange buttes jutting up in the east, a massive black scar to the west, a crumbling city skyline sinking into the crust—it looks amazing on a good PC. Every vista is a promise of adventure, but nearly every journey is the same. The classic open world mantra applies here: If you see it, you can go there. But should you go there? Probably not. That eerie tower at the top of the mountain and the deep cavern buried beneath the suburbs are both just full of junk loot and simple puzzles like every other location in Biomutant. Sidequests are bland too, most of which involve finding old world technology to complete an impressive breadth of variations of the same spinning dial, color-matching puzzle. The lack of imagination is so absurd that you'll even rotate measures of sheet music to solve some puzzles—like, strips of music pinned to paper. Other objects laminated with the same orange and white node-matching puzzle: TVs, arcade machines, fuse boxes, film projectors, radios, record players, microwaves, globes, meteors. Meteors! It's never fun. So I'm still surprised, after dozens of pointless collection quests and puzzles that are barely puzzles, how often Biomutant forces me to stop and reckon with what I'm looking at, be it a weasel in a space suit piloting a hot air balloon over a blackened chasm, or a huge ancient tortoise shuffling around the continent looking for a carrot to match their metabolism. Biomutant is a pretty good time if all you want is something strange and nice to look at.The first lap around the map, I was drunk on Biomutant's scenery. It's a genuinely stunning setting and you get some fancy rides to unravel it with, including a huge mechanical hand that turns into a literal hand cannon. Is it useful? Almost never. But is it cool? Yes, which defines the bulk of Biomutant, really. Because whether stomping around the ruins of a city in a huge mech or gliding through a toxic swamp on a homemade jet ski with an iron dragon head bolted to the front, the terrain is rarely an obstacle or threat, and the creatures in the farthest corners of the map are rarely a bigger problem than those in the starting area. I didn't have to think much about Biomutant's stat game at allCombat scenarios almost always consist of a burly mutant accompanied by some little guys, and a few melee and ranged minions, but they're easily taken care of by any means. Dodge, shoot, punch or slash—your verbs are limited—I can't recall a single fight that forced me to take a look at my gear, stats, and powers to do some serious theorycrafting. Enemies are largely the same basic archetypes with different fur coats, and while they're all incredible to behold—from huge tigers in denim vests to oily-eyed tree stump wolves—they're not much fun to fight after a couple hours, in part because of how quickly your stats and powers balloon in Biomutant. Layer in perks, per-level stat boosts, and psi powers, and your cute little mutant will hit demigod status alarmingly fast. It's fun to suck up everyone in a giant mucus ball and dive around the arena like a John Woo action hero at first, but combat is so easy I didn't ever have to think about where I was spending my perk points or stat upgrades. Even if I played messy I always had a huge stock of scavenged health kits to dip into. By hour five I didn't have any psi powers left to acquire. Besides the occasional gear swap, I didn't have to think much about Biomutant's stat game at all. A bummer, because there's an impressive breadth of combat styles and weapon types to work through, everything from hammers and boomerangs to dual pistols and bo staffs. There's a hypnotic rhythm to fights: melee combo, ranged weapon peppering and repositioning, psi-powers for elemental damage procs or crowd management, and then back to melee. It feels alright!Thank goodness for The Power of Cool though, because combat never gets much deeper. Every attack comes with unique animations, replete with dramatic slowdown and blur effects to sell the drama and athleticism. It's exciting at first, but perfectly timed dodges and exquisite weapon combos don't matter much when you've crafted gear that makes your HP kiss the moon and a single punch deadly enough to kill god. I love the expressive, experimental potential of Biomutant's crafting system. Bolting nails onto beanies to juice my fire resistance, or cobbling together a freeze-inducing shotgun with a fast reload speed should speak directly to a min-maxer's heart. But it's all lost on flat combat design that never encourages you to spec out gear for unique challenges. In my first few hours I put together a toxic toilet brush and fiery rolling pin for a dual-wielding melee build, forcing every enemy into comical puking or pants-on-fire animations, health bars collapsing in seconds. A few hours later I assembled a gun that mutilates the most difficult enemies, from towering elephant sasquatches to bus-sized raccoons, even faster, sucking the air out of every challenge thereon. For all its problems, I still liked parts of BiomutantI mean, I love it when RPGs reward gear tinkering and careful customization by shooting me ahead of the difficulty curve for a bit, but Biomutant never humbled me with a powerful new enemy or combat configuration so that I could repeat the experience.Biomutant's irradiated zones require some gear tinkering, but for small returns. Sticking around in these areas for too long in armor without the proper resistances will kill you, so building outfits around specific biomes is touted as a key driver in Biomutant's progression. But what you find in these deadly, alluring areas are just more simple fights and some rare loot you probably don't need. There are no huge narrative revelations or truly unique encounters to dig up. The irradiated zones are just like everywhere else in Biomutant, only dressed up with some extra visual effects to sell the danger of burning alive, freezing to death, suffocating, or sprouting a third arm.Just a few hours of running off to explore and do sidequests gave me a surplus of high level loot, rendering most of the vendors, upgrade stations, and the basic crafting systems themselves useless for the bulk of my playthrough. With no need to buy or upgrade items, I didn't need to put any leveling points into my barter skill, and I can only recall two minor conversations that benefited from my high persuasion stat. So everything was funneled into health, strength, agility, and my mutant psi powers. The hard difficulty option can't account for the glut of gear and simple combat design in Biomutant. If you take any prolonged detour, you'll quickly outpace whatever it throws at you. But here's that charm again, barely keeping me afloat in the form of my Kylo Ren-looking ferret decked out like a JNCO jeans catalogue model. If only my huge pants made a damn difference. And I guess they kind of do, because for all its problems, I still liked parts of Biomutant. I enjoyed it with a big pained grin much like the horrific smile of my spherically domed horse. I grit my teeth through the painful narration and groundless progression, if only to see what kind of fucked up muppet it would throw at me next. Biomutant is an extravagant cartoon diorama unlike anything on PC, it's just not much fun to play or listen to. Biomutant's stunning world barely survives the painful narration, broken progression, and dearth of stuff to do.

For the longest time, Biomutant has been my white whale. Like clockwork, a life sign would emerge, with the announcement that yes, it's coming, definitely, just not right now. In part, this is due to developer Experiment 101 having been granted an unusual amount of freedom by their publisher to keep adding stuff, which led to a game that always sounds like a lot on paper - a character customisable down to their genetic makeup who can wield any weapon, a crafting system allowing you to make virtually anything, a morality system, a map dwarfing even Skyrim's. It's full of superlatives any marketer would love, confident in selling itself as something you've never seen before. Trouble is, you absolutely have.To be fair, you've never controlled a character quite like this. The protagonist here is a mutant, a furry being reminiscent of a cat, or maybe more of a rodent, depending on which visual you're going with during character creation. You and others of your species are adept in the art of kung-fu, but you can also wield giant swords, guns, rocket launchers and karate weapons such as bo staves, sai blades and more. You can pick up any weapon regardless of your character class, which makes the classes superfluous - you can even find multiple ways to learn the starting perks each class comes with even if you chose another.To understand other areas in which Biomutant can't live up to the expectations it set itself, it's important to remember this is a game made by a team of just 20. You see it in the way copies of environments exist around the map, how some animations had to be foregone, how text repeats with certain actions. In many ways, it remains a marvel when considering the size of the team. The giant map often looks exquisite, its lush and vibrant forests flanked by ruined towns and toxic wastelands. The game runs like a dream on PC, with next to no need for loading screens and the framerate plummeting very rarely during some of the heavier action. The sheer amount of crafting items - screws, blades, bent metal, bats - is just as impressive as the many different skills the team thought of, like the psi attacks and toxic bio powers you can use in addition to melee and ranged combat. But every feature falls victim to the game's quantity over quality maxim. Take the crafting. Visually it's a lot of fun to tool together an axe and a vacuum cleaner, but of course near-endless variety in weapon design can't lead to endless variety in fighting styles. Instead, each weapon you make falls into one of four different categories, and just like that, we're on familiar ground again. To be clear - four fighting styles is still a lot, but then you have to keep in mind the strength of each weapon, meaning that if you want to switch, you might have to farm the right materials first. A great idea foiled by underlying mechanics. Biomutant simply wastes a lot of its own energy - and mine - in ways like this. You can tame mounts, only to find they're slower than your own running speed. In a lengthy side quest, you can search for materials to upgrade the mech you'll use in one boss fight, only to find the encounter is already too easy without them and you shouldn't have bothered.From afar, Biomutant's Devil May Cry-esque combat looks responsive and snappy. In reality, it feels as weightless as food wrappers blowing in the wind. Apart from the weak and sometimes entirely non-existent controller feedback - which obviously you won't miss using mouse and keyboard - it's also there in the animation quality. They're quite slow sometimes, hits don't visibly connect, and effect visuals, even the fun comic onomatopoeia, can't properly convey impact. The far-reaching consequences of this are an unfortunate masterclass in the importance of impact in animation, because whatever you do in Biomutant, no matter how wild things get, from piloting a mech to bouncing around in balls of viscous liquid, it always feels underwhelming.The overall balancing in combat feels off, as well. Biomutant has some visually wonderfully imaginative, huge foes, who will all rip you up like the aforementioned food wrapper, regardless of your level. If that was the intention, a la Horizon: Zero Dawn, I could deal with it, but an enemy's health bar and level are always prominently displayed, making me think there should be a difference at some point. No matter how many fun kung-fu manoeuvres I can do, it all wildly loses its appeal once I find out it's better just to use ranged weapons because being caught underfoot just once costs me half my health bar.Weirdly enough, this doesn't make Biomutant difficult, just repetitive. In many ways, it's far too easy - you can hack away at a regular enemy's giant health bar for ages, but down a boss with a lot less effort. It's a shame because Experiment 101 clearly poured so much into Biomutant's boss design. Those main battles, where I both got a special gadget to fight and an enemy with an interesting attack pattern, feel like Biomutant at its best - but then you go back to scrounging for loot or engaging in a collect-a-thon of side quests to the tune of  ""find every microwave"" and ""flush every toilet"". Several items necessary for progress were so out of the way from the main quest location that it felt as if Biomutant held items hostage so that I'd look at the entire map. Now and then you're asked to solve a rotation puzzle, and every puzzle plays the same - you turn knobs left or right. It's disappointing.Technically Biomutant doesn't have a story. Well, it does have a story - you're asked to fight a number of big monsters in order to revitalise the World Tree and stave off impending doom - but it doesn't have a plot. You know what you've got to do, and all that's left is to do it. Everyone does kung-fu, so there's a lot of talk of unity and harmony, honour and the value of training, but it's literally just hot air - the few characters you meet don't have conversations with you, they offer calendar quotes and some exposition, and your only way to participate is to ask for clarification - at one point when a character told me the end of the world tree would mean the end of the world, I had the options to ask ""World Tree?"" and ""The end?"".An incorporeal narrator (David Shaw Parker) follows your kung-fu rodent's adventure, but he doesn't narrate, he comments (""Fine weather to be out"") and makes combat noises (""Blam! Kapow!""). He also translates what characters are saying to you, because apparently no one in this world speaks your language, including the members of your own race. He will announce night and day, even when you're inside, in sometimes truly bewildering ways (""Better perk your ears up, darkness doesn't hurt sound""). You can tone him down if he gets too much for you, and he will, but you can't shut the narration off completely. The entire game uses baby speak to such an extent it sometimes took me a moment to figure out what it was even talking about.There are enemy camps to take down - an open world staple - occupied by six warring mutant factions. You pick one of two starting factions, the good one or the bad one, and then you go off and take your rival's bases. Genuine effort has been put into having each of these skirmishes play slightly differently, and it's greatly appreciated, but a clan war in the middle of a story about the end of the world is an entirely different, yet curiously mandatory thing, narratively unmoored, tacked on to make the game bigger. There are a lot more narrative inconsistencies, like the long conversation about the value of life and honour before you go and set an entire base on fire, but there's not much use in thinking about it, since I suspect no one will play this particular game for its narrative. Biomutant shouts a lot about its Aura system, basically just another morality system, but this, too, is close to pointless. No matter what faction you pick, no matter whether you kill or not, not only do you have the option to change your mind about whether that makes you good or bad each time - making none of the touted moral choices permanent - the choices also amount to nothing but points for your psi skills. Both 'routes', as it were, play the same.Experiment 101 took years to stuff a game with features instead of focusing on its strengths to deliver a quality experience half as long. Everything that exists seems to have been made so that someone could say wow, look at all this stuff, yet the sad truth is all of it is available elsewhere and in better quality, likely because you can't take on AAA open-world games in scope if you're a team of 20. That a team of this size felt they had to deliver something of that magnitude says a lot about the rabid appetites of the gaming industry, our obsession with ""more is more"" and how it's possible to whittle something genuinely innovative down to a nub.It hurts to say that about the effort of a team that tried to work crunch-free and was given an amount of time and creative freedom other developers can only dream of. But the whole game feels like an exercise in adding certain open-world staples, always erring on the side of caution. I've said this before, but even when gaming, more so than any other medium, feels like the place where we gladly accept being served the same things over and over, the safer we play it the more oversaturated the market feels. Biomutant is not a bad game, but it is a mediocre one, and ends up the very thing it tried not to be.You're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!

Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy.It's not often that a game gets a ""what the heck is it"" trailer mere days before its release. But it's clear that developer Experiment 101 is as confused as to how to market Biomutant as I am to review it. It's a game that tries to include as many systems and mechanics as possible, taking influences from games like Ratchet and Clank, Fortnite, and Monster Hunter, and then attempts to force them into one cohesive package. There comes a certain comedy with its assortment of parts, but, overall the result is a game that never feels at ease with itself. It's confused, confusing, and yet, I kinda like it. Release date: May 25, 2021
Platform(s): PS4, Xbox One, PC
Developer: Experiment 101
Publisher: THQ NordixBiomutant has been a long time coming. Originally announced back in 2017, Biomutant has been plagued by delays – both from the key developer having major back surgery and from a change in vision and scope – but unfortunately, it hasn't benefited from being released in 2021. It has emerged in the shadow of other big, ambitious open-world RPGs like Assassin's Creed Valhalla, which has only further exposed Biomutant's flaws. The game is set against a backdrop of a post-apocalypse world, where humanity has been wiped out by pollution, corporate greed, and nuclear power exploration. The world left behind is dominated by the titular Biomutants – strange animal hybrids that are part cat, part rabbit, and 100% capable of wielding weaponry. These creatures have formed six tribes, who'll you need to either unite or destroy to bring harmony to the land, which is also plagued by four world eaters – known as Puffs, for some reason. These huge beasts have been attacking the world tree (the last bastion of life on earth), and it's up to you to defeat all four and protect what's left. Sounds dramatic, right?Well, it's undercut by the fact the narrative is delivered in the most painful of ways. Characters will speak to you in gibberish, then after a pause, a narrator tells you what they've said. It's so slow that I found myself skipping the gibberish to get to the narration, only to accidentally skip over both, losing crucial slices of information or quest objectives. Like Horizon Zero Dawn, the characters have developed their own names for various human elements, which only adds to the fact the narrative can feel like a children's storybook. For example, a piano is a 'string plonk', a guitar is a 'twing-twang', and your mother is your Mooma, which is said with such drawn-out vowels it's almost impossible to take seriously. The childish language constantly butts heads with the old-world commentary, failing to strike the sort of tone you might expect from a game with such bright and inviting visuals, and the fuzziest of casts.It doesn't help that the character creation is quite off-putting. Despite my best attempts – an almost an hour of tweaking – I couldn't ever settle on a character that I was drawn to or found even vaguely adorable. Big buck teeth, teenie eyes, mismatched body parts, and other oddities were seemingly the only options, with all of that exaggerated by the Biomutant breed you opted for. The Biomutant poster child that we've been seeing for years is far removed from the little fuzzy fighter I ended up with.The character creation and story beats are just the beginning though, as this game continues to feel at odds with itself. Struggle through the very linear opening, and the world folds out before you, only to reveal that Biomutant suffers from having an abundance of systems to get to grips with – none of which are ever particularly well explained. It's part looter shooter grind, with new weapons and armor hidden in old furniture and chests across the world, but there's also an odd and overly complicated crafting system too. I am particularly attached to an electric sword I made from an old toilet brush, but it's definitely far from the easiest system to get to grips with. There's just so much stuff.Plus, you can upgrade your character in various ways, including enhancing abilities related to the class type you picked, your resistance to different environmental elements like the cold or radiation, and the option to unlock weapon-type specific combos. But Biomutant's nested sub-menus and use of different upgrade currencies are scattershot and awkward, especially when plenty of the upgrades can also be achieved using the mountain of gear you'll discover as you explore. The same can be said of the combat, which regularly flips from feeling clumsy and clunky to brilliantly silly, with comic book-inspired exclaims and descriptions popping up for certain combos and movements that don't ever get used anywhere else – another of Biomutant's odd design decisions. Overly subtle button prompts can leave you mashing buttons trying to return the projectiles needed to smash through defenses, and the combo patterns all depend on what you've unlocked and what weapon type you're using. The combination of ranged and melee weapons, along with Psi Powers can be great fun, though their success does rely on finding the arsenal mix that really works for your play style and class type.There's also a morality system, with your character capable of moving between dark and light polarities depending on the decisions you make. But, it constantly invades the story, makes little sense, and has seemingly no effect on the ending outcome – to the point where I am still absolutely seething about the game's closing moments.That's not to say that there isn't plenty to love in Biomutant, especially when it comes to the world it offers up. It's certainly not a graphical marvel – even running on PC on maximum settings – but there's definitely a beauty to it. It's a game rich with things to discover, from remnants of the old world, to funky weaponry and unusual foes. Some areas will be inaccessible until you've found the right gadget or better armor to protect you too, which adds a level of unexpectedness to your travels. If you're partial to a little relaxing map mopping as I am, there's lots to keep you busy and that's meant I've spent 30+ hours enjoying Biomutant despite its flaws and oddities. The main narrative is engaging too, with a whimsical cast of characters, excellent set pieces, and bizarre story moments. Plus, the four boss battles are particularly memorable. A core part of the campaign is unlocking new gadgets, like a mech suit and jetski, which you'll need to take down each of the World Eater Puffs – that are ridiculously named Hoof Puff, Jumbo Puff, Muck Puff, and Porky Puff, which sound more like types of potato chip than big bads. But that's just part of Biomutant's overwhelming jovial personality, which relies on humor more than drama to propel you through – even if it is a little puerile and toilet-centric at times.But, every time you really enjoy a moment in Biomutant, it finds the capacity to frustrate you. Like the endless repetition of dialogue, side missions, and hidden areas. The assaults you mount as you try to unite the tribes are intensely formulaic – to the point that they reuse the same barrack and invasion sequence multiple times. Hidden vaults have exactly the same layout and aesthetics, to the point that, after you'd discovered one, you'll notice that loot and discoverables were in the exact same spots across multiple locations. And yet, there are moments where the game's attention to detail is great, such as using the ice weapon will make enemies skid across the ground like an excerpt from a Ratchet and Clank adventure. It's such a shame, because there is a great game in here. Biomutant's world and its characters are wonderful and brilliantly silly, but these elements clash against some of the more serious elements of the core story. The intensely formulaic and repetitive moments distract from the brilliant ones that'll have you nodding in approval, or laughing at its bizarreness. And it all comes down to the fact it doesn't really know exactly what it is or wants to be. If you got Biomutant in a sale, you wouldn't be sad, but as a full-priced offering, it feels too confused to easily recommend. Reviewed on PC with a code provided by the publisher.Sam Loveridge is the Global Editor-in-Chief of GamesRadar, and joined the team in August 2017.

Biomutant,Marcus Stewart,Game Informer,https://www.gameinformer.com/review/biomutant/biomutant-review-a-flawed-mutation,"Much like its gene-spliced protagonist, Biomutant is a hodgepodge of ideas stitched together to form what is ultimately a mixed bag. The game blends elements of open-world design with stylish action, gunplay, crafting, a morality system, and more. Like many jacks-of-all-trades it winds up being a master of none, and a thick layer of technical jank on top of half-baked ideas makes Biomutant feel like a case of feature creep that needed to be scaled back.  At its core, Biomutant is a typical open-world game featuring a large map littered with basic objectives, points of interests, and various environmental biomes with bizarre wildlife roaming in between. Despite its post-apocalyptic premise, the vibrant overworld is packed with color, and I love how that beauty is juxtaposed with ruins of modern civilization. A majestic Tree of Life sits at the world's center and its four gigantic roots snake for miles overhead for a wondrous sight. The anthropomorphic character and monster designs are a charming blend of strange, funny and, sometimes, unsettling.I enjoyed Biomutant most when I simply explored, stumbling upon hidden bunkers or abandoned villages and clearing them of their precious loot. Traveling gets even better thanks to a variety of transportation options, from riding various mounts to stomping around in a mech suit to soaring on a glider. Summoning a mech from the sky feels empowering until you realize some vehicles can only be used in vaguely designated zones. Being barred from summoning my boat in one clear body of water but not another puts a damper on the game’s sense of freedom.Combat blends stylish melee with wacky gunplay but lacks the polish it needs, often feeling messy and imprecise. Parrying feels especially unsatisfying, and the loose lock-on system makes staying on target a finnicky pain. I appreciated the variety of special powers at my disposal such as creating trails of fire or conjuring ice storms. These abilities add a flashy wrinkle to the action, but they also don’t pack as much punch as I wanted in battle, even after investing stat points into them.Biomutant’s combat became more tolerable once I acquired stronger weapons via a robust and rewarding crafting system. After collecting random junk like old sniper scopes, trumpet horns, or even bananas, you can slap together devastating killing machines. I had a great time maximizing this system, and seeing my creations tear through monsters always felt rewarding. The same goofy satisfaction applies to armor and gear; my character rocked a mascot helmet and a polo shirt that looked ridiculous, but the outfit was augmented to be as sturdy as a suit of armor. The drive to make cooler weapons is potent and scavenging for new parts consistently felt worthwhile even when I found loot that was inferior to what I already had. That’s because you can always sell it or, better yet, break it down into valuable ingredients to craft better parts. Biomutant boasts an overwhelming amount of side activities that are mediocre best but too many of them boil down to completing simple actions a set number of times in different locations. The tasks themselves aren’t bad, they’re just the definition of busy work, and the rewards aren’t worth the effort half the time. Still, you don’t need to worry about a lack of content in Biomutant; my quest log overflowed with things to keep me busy for dozens of hours, even if those activities were largely shallow.While elements around the edges can allow some degree of entertainment, it all feels hollow when it’s funneled into an underwhelming narrative core. Upon bringing your furry hero to life, you’re saddled with several big tasks. Four destructive World Eaters are killing the Tree of Life, and it's up to you to stop them. You also need to bring an end to a tribe war by joining one faction and then uniting or eradicating the rest. On top of that, the brute who murdered your family in childhood has resurfaced and must be dealt with. Did I mention there’s also a life-saving Ark that holds a limited number of seats and you must determine which of your allies gets a free ride should the world go sideways? Biomutant juggles a lot of threads but none of them are engaging. Avenging your parents’ death lacks any emotional punch because the killer is barely a factor in the story, and the final showdown unfolds in predictable, anticlimactic fashion. Solving the tribe war simply involves conquering the other settlements in bland confrontations and deciding whether to kill or spare the leaders. World Eater missions have the most meat on their bones by far, with various tasks, such as obtaining vehicles, aimed to prepare you for the big fights. However, facing these beasts consists of sloppily designed boss fights that rob these titanic battles of any sense of awe. The Ark subplot feels entirely unnecessary and doesn’t even make total sense if you manage to save everything anyway. The lackluster storytelling further diminishes an already shallow morality system, which yo-yos between basic black and white choices.Throughout your journey a pleasant British narrator recites the entire adventure. He does an adequate job, but his rampant interjections outside of cutscenes wore on me after a while. The narrator also speaks for every character, which robs them of any individuality, and conversations become tedious since you have to wait for the narrator to translate the creatures’ gibberish. The only other voices you hear are your two bickering fairies, which represent your light and dark side, and they became my favorite personalities by default for having, well, personality. I like that they’re both jerks constantly belittling each other while rallying you to join their side.A lackluster presentation and technical issues further spoil the experience. Cutscenes are rough thanks to stilted animations and an overall flat delivery. An occasionally wonky camera can zoom inside of objects during conversations. Cinematics sometimes end abruptly, even cutting off dialogue in progress. Playing on PC offers a smoother outing, but various bugs and hard crashes hindered my adventure on console.Biomutant consistently shows glimmers of promise but it takes patience and a pair of rose-colored glasses to see them. I genuinely loathed my first several hours with the game, but once I made cooler weapons that made combat more tolerable or admired another postcard-worthy sight, I felt more disappointed than anything. Biomutant has all the ingredients of a unique, entertaining adventure. It just spends too much time doing everything possible to try and impress its audience instead of polishing its handful of strengths.

Biomutant,Richard Wakeling,GameSpot,https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/biomutant-review-a-flawed-mutation/1900-6417678/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f,"Biomutant presents a different take on the post-apocalypse, but a forgettable story and uneven gameplay hold it back.By 
    Richard Wakeling
   on May 24, 2021 at 8:00AM PDTBiomutant's post-apocalyptic open world differs from the norm, even if it's guilty of adhering to a few familiar tropes. The remnants of its neglected towns are still populated by dilapidated buildings and roaming bandits, and its overgrown roadways are littered with the burnt-out husks of abandoned vehicles. But Biomutant also utilizes a vivid color palette that makes its verdant fields and picturesque red mountains pop with the kind of striking vibrancy that's rarely associated with the apocalypse.Throw in some furry anthropomorphic creatures, and Biomutant's character design and general style is certainly atypical of the genre. Yet it also consists of a mishmash of fairly obvious influences, from a Breath of the Wild-esque structure to combo-driven combat that's similar to Devil May Cry, and other familiar elements from the likes of Fallout, Max Payne, and Borderlands. It's a flavorful petri dish, for sure, and there are plenty of uneven and drab aspects to its overall design and structure. The mixture between old and new ideas doesn't always sit right, but Biomutant also manages to carve out its own identity amid its many inspirations.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Biomutant ReviewThis begins with the character creator, as you step into the flocculent skin of one of the aforementioned creatures--an odd hybrid between a squirrel, rat, and any other scurrying critter that comes to mind. Choosing a breed affects your starting stats to a certain degree, and you can pump points into specific attributes if you fancy, say, dealing more melee damage or increasing your chances of bartering with merchants. If this sounds like your typical by-the-numbers RPG progression system, it's because it is. There's some personality to the character creator, as your body shape will change depending on which stats you opt to emphasize--big head for intellect, big biceps for strength. Ultimately, however, your starting attributes aren't especially significant. You're able to put 10 points into a category each time you level up, so it's easy to build a fairly well-rounded character within a few hours.The final part of creating your character involves picking a class, which impacts both your starting weapon and the addition of a unique skill. The Commando, for instance, inflicts 10% more damage with ranged weapons, while the Psi-Freak gets access to a lightning attack that otherwise isn't available to the other classes. These aren't game-changing skills, and you'll be swapping out weapons by the dozen in no time at all, but they do add a smidgen of variety to subsequent playthroughs.The latter example is also one of the few instances where Biomutant will lock you out of using a specific ability. Even if you pick a class such as the rogue-like Saboteur, you're still able to use Psi-Powers and Biogenetics and wield any of the available weapon types, so there's plenty of freedom to play the game how you want. The only other time you're unable to unlock certain abilities is when you come across Psi-Powers that are dependent upon your Aura alliance. Biomutant's Aura system is split into light and dark sides, with good and bad deeds affecting your standing in each. It's a typical morality system, with your deeds and dialogue choices impacting how other characters see you. You're not locked into either light or darkness once you start going down one path, so there is some flexibility to play as a morally grey character and dabble in both sides of the spectrum.In truth, the majority of your choices have an insignificant impact on Biomutant's story. The biggest decision you'll make occurs within the game's first hour, as you're asked to align with one of two tribes. While the obvious light-sided tribe wants you to unite the other clans and defeat four deadly Worldeaters to save the world, the dark-sided tribe would prefer if you did the opposite by conquering the other clans and defeating the Worldeaters to cleanse the world and start anew. This essentially sets up your overarching objective and impacts the ending you'll get if you decide to stick to your chosen path, but doesn't change the missions you'll embark on to get there. Beating the Worldeaters and capturing the other tribe outposts makes up the bulk of the game either way, and the narrative just isn't interesting enough to make your choices feel meaningful.The story contextualizes your progression and gives you a reason to push on, but there's little else to it. The presence of an amiable narrator is a nice touch, and this omniscient voice does add a dash of personality to the game. Aside from occasionally chiming in with destiny-centric tangents, the narrator also acts as a translator for every character in the game. It's an unusual method of storytelling that alters the dialogue so that a character won't directly ask you for help--rather, the narrator will say something along the lines of: ""She explains that you need to gather wood to repair that building."" This makes conversations inherently amusing, at least initially, but it does mean characters struggle to stand out, considering they all share the same voice. The writing doesn't do the cast any favors in this regard either, with most characters existing just to spew exposition and lore before sending you on a fetch quest. It's clear that a lot of effort was put into fleshing out the backstory of this post-apocalyptic world--or at least throwing in as many kooky names as possible--but being told about it via a verbal salvo that foregoes any sense of character isn't an engaging way to absorb it, particularly when adopting a ""tell, don't show"" approach.Unimaginative mission design compounds the story's shortcomings, as your quest to defeat all four Worldeaters always boils down to a formulaic back and forth. The general structure is decent enough, with the Tree of Life looming high in the center of the map--its mammoth roots jutting out in four distinct directions. There's a Worldeater waiting at the end of each root and a supporting character that's willing to help you reach them. The problem is that the way you reach each one is always the same. You meet a character, they reveal the vehicle you need to use, then you're sent to grab a part they need to get it working, and repeat. The vehicles themselves offer a nice change of pace, with a hulking mech and gun-toting speedboat on the agenda, among others. But the journey's always short and quick, making the Worldeaters feel anticlimactic. It's also a tad odd that you spend the game building up your own character, only to defeat the game's biggest foes while behind the wheel of various vehicles.Combat is fun in short bursts, too, although it takes a couple of hours to find its footing. The reasons for this are three-fold: both the dodge and parry mechanics require some time to get the hang of--the automatic lock-on is inconsistent--and your starting moves and weapons are underwhelming. Once your arsenal opens up and you attain a few more combos, the combat begins to find its groove, albeit one that's dictated by routine. You're always equipped with both melee and ranged weapons, and each weapon type has its own simple combos. If you perform three different combos in the middle of a fight, you can enter a state of Super Wung-Fu, where you're able to pummel enemies with a rapid barrage of attacks, soar through the air in bullet time to rain down shots or deliver a devastating ground pound to disperse crowds. Combat is built around reaching Super Wung-Fu, so most fights consist of the same three-combo routine. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but your repertoire of combos isn't particularly expansive, so you're regularly using the same moves over and over again.Psi-Powers and the mutated Biogenetics add more variety to combat, allowing you to blaze a trail of fire or encase yourself within a Mucus Bubble that enemies will helplessly stick to. Judicious use of slow-motion also gives your attacks a sense of tangible impact, and the relatively infrequent nature of combat works in its favor when it comes to staving off repetition. In between flights, you're incentivized to explore Biomutant's open world with promises of loot. Each location even features a convenient checklist so you know if you're missing anything.Although you'll occasionally find new weapons and armor when scavenging through the wreckage of derelict buildings, loot is more geared towards attaining better materials, since the best weapons in the game are the ones you make yourself. Biomutant's crafting system is dynamic, with an almost limitless amount of concoctions available for you to build. The items you make are essentially repurposed garbage, as you use whatever rusty contraptions you can get your hands on, whether it's an oversized toothbrush that was previously attached to a billboard or the handle of a broken vacuum cleaner.Experimenting with different combinations that shouldn't work is part of the crafting system's charm, and provides you with a sense of ownership over your nonsensical invention. Having said that, both melee and ranged weapons are split into distinct categories, such as one-handed slash, automatic rifles, and so on. The weapons within these categories don't feel all that different from one another, which does take some of the shine off the crafting system. Charging into battle with a new weapon that has enhanced damage numbers is still inherently satisfying, however.Biomutant often has these moments, where its systems don't quite cooperate and you end up with something uneven. While combat is fun in moderation and the crafting system is bizarre in all the right ways, the flip side of this is dull and monotonous quest design, a forgettable story, and hollow morality. There's still an enjoyable game here, but a lot of unfortunate caveats come attached to that statement. Yet while it might not always hit the mark, Biomutant is an ambitiously flawed game from a small studio, and the games industry could always use more risky endeavors like this one.

Biomutant,Zack Zwiezen,Kotaku,https://kotaku.com/biomutant-the-kotaku-review-1846941353,"Some four years since open-world action RPG Biomutant was first revealed to the world with a cool trailer, it’s finally out. Although for those who’ve waited so patiently to play it, they may well be disappointed to discover a gorgeous but janky mess, overly ambitious but under-achieving, and really rather broken.Biomutant is the first game from Swedish developer Experiment 101. The team, which is made up of around 20 people, decided to start out big. Biomutant is a large, action RPG set in a new and unique post-apocalyptic open world, filled with mutated, intelligent animals and no humans. It also boasts a full morality system, multiple endings, a long list of side content, a variety of vehicles and mounts to use, full narration, a crafting system, randomized loot, ranged and melee combat, power-ups, and probably other things I’ve forgotten about. Every few hours during my 18-hour playthrough I found myself stumbling into a new mechanic or feature of the game and saying out loud, “Wow, now this is part of the game too?” Sadly, Biomutant struggles to pull all of these pieces together and make them work.The game is set in the far future, long after humanity has escaped Earth after a giant corporation destroyed the planet with chemicals, deforestation, and mining. That company’s meddling and awful practices ended up mutating all life left on the planet, leading to a world filled with sentient animal-people who can also shoot magic and energy from their hands. But this strange, quirky world is in danger. A large tree—known as The Tree of Life—is dying, and when it goes, so too does the world. Four powerful creatures, Worldeaters, are eating its large roots, killing it in the process. Your furry character, whom you create at the start of the game, has returned home to the tree to save it and reconnect with the people they left behind after a deadly attack on your village killed your family.This setup and the state of the world were hammered into my brain during the game’s unbearable intro. The first few hours of Biomutant are a bore, broken up by bland tutorials and overly long exposition dumps, all of which are delivered by the narrator. A narrator who ends up being a problem for the whole game, as the British storyteller is one of only three voice actors in the game who speaks English. Every conversation you have in Biomutant is translated by him. Every event that happens, every moment of in-world lore, relies on this same British dude and his admittedly nice voice. It quickly becomes grating and makes the world of Biomutant feel small and cheap.It doesn’t help that every animal in this game talks forever about morality, life, death, destiny, and more. The writing is extremely preachy and redundant, leading to me dreading each time I met a new character, not a great feeling to have in an open-world game. It also made the narrative hard to care about as it all became a lot of lectures about the same topics, all voiced by the same guy. It was like I was stuck in a never-ending TED Talk.Once you get out of the awful opening section and the game opens up, things get better.Biomutant’s main gameplay loop goes like this: You get told which Worldeater to target next, make your way up to that area of the open-world map, meet someone who talks too much, help them fix up a vehicle that can kill the big creature, then use said vehicle to fight and destroy the Worldeater. After that you head back to the Tree of Life in the middle of the map, talk to your older mentor about what to do next, and repeat.Biomutant mixes together melee combat, unarmed action, and gunplay into a mostly slick gameplay experience. Within only a few hours I was quickly and smoothly flipping around large groups of enemies, popping some with my guns, killing others with my big sword, and even using neat mutations and energy attacks to clear out groups of baddies. All of this feels effortless, once you get a hang of the somewhat floaty controls. Soon I was also creating and building my own weapons and augmenting my armor and gear with junk I found while exploring the world.None of this is revolutionary, you’ve probably played a few games that did a lot of these things, but Biomutant’s setting and the way it tries to bring them all together is impressive, even if it doesn’t succeed every time. For example, you have a ton of weapons and fighting styles to unlock and try out, from two-handed swords to unarmed to hammers. But they mostly all use the same basic combos and feel similar. Various guns feel more distinct but suffer from having a lot of options, but not much depth in each. Though this does mean that once you master the combat you’ll be able to quickly switch to new and different attack styles without needing to relearn 20+ new combos. This makes it very easy to experiment in Biomutant and try out new ways to play, which I appreciated greatly.However, the looping gameplay quickly becomes tedious and it doesn’t help that almost nearly every sidequest and main quest in Biomutant is a fetch quest. Many of the sidequests will ask you to go off and collect 10 or 20 things. I did a handful of these, but found that I leveled up quickly enough, and discovered great loot, without bothering with more, so eventually I just stopped doing them.While trying to save the world, you’ll also be able to take part in a large war raging between half a dozen or so animal tribes spread across the map. You pick to either join the Jagni, who want to kill all the other tribes to bring peace, or the Myriad, who wish to dominate and merge all the tribes under them to bring peace. The Jagni are presented as evil and the Myriad are positioned to be the good guys, though the game does allow you to criticize either tribe’s methods throughout the game.The tribal war questline involves attacking and taking over enemy outposts and camps dotted all over the map. Sometimes, depending on your stats, you can talk the enemy tribe into surrendering. I was leveled up enough by the end to even bring the whole conflict to a close with a conversation, forcing some tribes to join the Myriad without having to lift a finger. It was a nice reward for putting skill points into my intellect attribute, though beyond this moment the RPG skill system felt underutilized. Just one more feature in this big muddle of a game that doesn’t quite get the love it deserves.""Furry Simulator 2021 Is Darker Than I Expected...""Open-world action RPG featuring guns and kicksA colorful world, slick combat, furry friendsBuggy, too many fetch quests, crappy performance, annoying narratorExperiment 101May 25Xbox One, PC, PS4 (Played via PS5) Around 19 hoursEverything you do in the game not only earns you XP, which helps you unlock new abilities and moves, but it also influences the morality system. (Feeling exhausted by features yet?) This is split between dark and light. You’ll never forget this system exists because the game constantly stops what you are doing and has two demon-like creatures appear, who talk in weird voices and go on for far too long about morality and light and dark choices. The morality system touches a lot of Biomutant. Some characters won’t talk to you or work with you if your aura is too dark or light. Some abilities, like energy attacks, are also locked behind aura levels. And how the game ends is tied directly to the choices you make, who you help and don’t help, plus your overall aura. While the morality system is a neat idea, in practice it ends up being mostly useless because you can quickly max out your aura and never think about it again. I did this early on in the game while exploring the world and I wasn’t even trying to. While it might be a bit underbaked, the feature does add more replayability to the game, letting you come back and be more of a bastard rat or a goodie-two-shoes fluff bucket.Biomutant’s art is probably the best part of the game. It has a colorful look and style, using brightly colored menus and comic book-like pop-ups during combat. The world is also lovely to look at. I took a lot of gorgeous screenshots of sunsets, irradiated forests, and neverending red canyon deserts. Some areas of the game, known as deadzones, can be filled with neon-colored particles, gasses, and plants. These areas, which feature deadly hazards like cold weather or radioactive material, are dangerous to explore without a suit. Though at higher levels I was able to spam health kits and explore freely without. The game doles out health packs like crazy, so this was a viable strategy later in Biomutant. Another example of a neat idea that isn’t properly working. At least these areas provided good loot and nice screenshots using the photo mode.If Biomutant sounds like your kind of game, and it might be, one thing to keep in mind is that it’s currently a buggy mess. This could change with patches, but at least now, I would be wary of recommending it to anyone who can’t stand some jank in their experience. On PS5 I dealt with 18 crashes. It ended up being about one every hour I played. I also had times where I got stuck in the floor, unable to move or fell through elevators. Menus would sometimes screw up and not show me the correct stats, like showing damage values on health kits. Performance was also a problem. On a PS5 the game struggled to maintain 60 FPS during gameplay and it would often freeze randomly for a second or two during large areas or combat. It never made it unplayable, but if I wasn’t reviewing this game for work I’d have stopped a few hours in after the fifth crash and countless bugs.It’s a shame that Biomutant isn’t a better put-together piece of software. Its world feels unique, the way it blends different combat styles is fun and it’s a visual treat to look at on a big 4K TV. But countless bugs, performance issues, overly talkative NPCs, boring quest design, and a sense of overall jank makes it hard to excitedly share this game with people. If you can put up with the rough edges and don’t mind an annoying narrator, you might have a good time with Biomutant. There is certainly a lot to do. But if you prefer more stable games, I’d advise waiting. ."

Paul Tamburro 
How did this happen? Biomutant has been in development since 2015, originally set for release in 2018, before being delayed all the way into 2021. We’ve seen smatterings of footage here and there and the occasional playable build, with developer Experiment 101 being so quiet that they even had to confirm the game wasn’t canceled. Typically, this signals a game being sent out to die by its publisher as a result of it not meeting internal expectations. But no — Biomutant is somehow one of the most boundlessly fun, ambitious, and creative open-world games I’ve played, surprising me at every turn with its unapologetic focus on letting the player have a good time. So again: How did this happen?!I was waiting for the moment Biomutant would collapse in on itself. Its opening greeted me with a barrage of information, from the ‘Dark’ and ‘Light’ moral decisions you can make throughout the game, to its exhaustive crafting system, to its combination of melee and ranged combat.We’ve repeatedly seen what happens when a developer has too many ideas, and these ideas shoved into a massive open-world suggested disaster was imminent. But that disaster never came, with its various features and systems bouncing off one another with a fluidity rarely seen from massive developers, let alone Experiment 101’s small team.The reason why I have fallen quite in love with Biomutant can be best exemplified by my most recent adventure in it. I’m over 40 hours in, playing through a New Game+ save after completing its story (which took roughly 25 hours, including a good amount of exploration). While heading over to an objective, I stumble upon a crack in some rocks. I venture through, and I’m told that I’ve entered a mysterious location hiding some Superb Loot. I’m never one to turn down Superb Loot, so I walk through its dank cavern, before being confronted by a towering monster named ‘Bubba Sknarfs.’ I take out my custom-built shock rifle and mow it down, pilfering through its gargantuan pockets for items before heading further into danger. I take down tentacle monsters appearing from out the water, use my mutant abilities to spawn mushrooms I can jump on to clear colossal jumps, and proceed to get incredibly lost on the hunt for this elusive loot.Then, I stop myself: “Wait — what was I supposed to be doing?”Biomutant is full of these moments where you’ll unwittingly find yourself straying off the beaten path. Its inveigling world design, full of little mysteries hiding in plain sight around every corner and over every hill, invite you in until your initial goal becomes a vague memory.Even after spending so many hours with it, I know that I’m still going to be surprised when I jump back in. Experiment 101 released a screenshot of the player-character as a bat, and I have no idea what that is! I have completed this game, deeply investigated almost every nook and cranny I have come into contact with, and I have still yet to come across any form of wearable bat wings or similar bat attire. I know that this surprise is still waiting for me, among many others, and I know that I’m going to continue to be distracted by a thousand other things before I eventually find it.I could feel Biomutant’s mutated claws sinking into me due to its exhaustive and immensely satisfying crafting and customization. If you already know of Biomutant, then it’s likely as a result of it letting you make your player-character really intelligent by way of giving it a big head. That’s its biggest selling point right out of the gate, and it doesn’t disappoint.Your anthropomorphic protagonist’s skills and abilities are directly related to its appearance, with the slider that adjusts its height, width, and proportions also changing its strength, agility, intellect, and the like. There’s a monstrous charm to these character designs — think gross-out ’90s cartoons rather than furry-friendly Sonic the Hedgehog characters.﻿This level of customization extends to weaponry, which can be upgraded or built from the ground up by the player. Weapons fit into different categories such as one-handed melee, shotguns, and rifles, with you able to either build them from the ground up or tinker with existing weapons. You can create a whole arsenal of equipment that’s unique to you, from making a revolver with an add-on that lets it shoot out ice blasts, to attaching a big fuck-off Final Fantasy sword to an ancient axe handle and having it also leave radiation in its wake.Speaking of radiation, Biomutant’s offbeat world is the by-product of its after-effects, following its near-extinction at the hands of an ambivalent and pollutive civilization that came before them. This civilization is gone now, and in their wake are mutant animals of all shapes and sizes stuck in a spectacular furry apocalypse, with a world reliant on the literal Tree of Life that sits at the center of everything.However, this Tree is facing its own major problem, as several Kaiju-sized monsters known as the Worldeaters are gnawing on its roots. The tribes of this land each have their own differing opinions in regards to how this threat should be handled, and you must decide who to align with. Should the world be saved? Or should it be left to die and a new world born in its place?Its inhabitants speak their own language, with various dialects being adopted by different species, so a (very British) narrator provides translation for them. It’s an interesting choice and one that certainly isn’t going to please everyone, but I found it to be charming. It also helps further illustrate that this is a very alien world you’re exploring; it’s kind of like Star Wars’ Cantina scene, but on a grander scale.Biomutant’s story is split between a classic revenge tale as you hunt the killer of your ‘Mooma’ (mother), a grand adventure to save the planet as you go after the Worldeaters, and a war drama as you become entrenched in its tribal feud. While it’s not the most memorable of yarns — though lore you find throughout the world fills in its world’s intriguing backstory — the presence of the narrator gives it a fairytale feel, as though you’re part of a bedtime fable you have direct control over. The decisions you make along the way will grant you either a Dark or Light Aura, which will have longstanding ramifications on both the fate of your player-character and the world altogether.The various characters you meet will have their own opinion on your moral alignment. If you have a Dark Aura, morally good characters will treat you with suspicion and hesitancy while bad characters will applaud you. If you have a Light Aura, you’ll be hailed by the former while berated by the latter.You can talk to anyone within this world, from the creatures you’re sent to on your main missions to the random civilians roaming around. Some will present you with new side-quests you may have missed, while others will simply offer their thoughts on the impending demise of their planet. For a game about mutated rodents, there are some genuinely thought-provoking philosophical lines in its script, with Experiment 101 having clearly been inspired by ancient Chinese proverbs.This inspiration is also present in its visual design and characterization, with there being many characters, costumes, buildings, and the like with a clear Eastern influence. I can’t speak to how well Biomutant pulls this off given my lack of knowledge or experience in that department, but it appears to have been handled respectfully, while also making sense within the context of the game’s world. Its Eastern inspiration isn’t merely used as window-dressing, with this being evident across its story, script, design, and combat.Biomutant adopts its own martial art form in ‘Wung Fu,’ a style coined by your Mooma who trained the heads of the tribes you now find yourself stuck between. Wung Fu is a seamless blend of melee, ranged, biogenetic, and Psi-powers, with you being able to pull off combos across all four which leads to righteous, stylish action. Even after many hours played, I’m still excited whenever I stumble upon a turf war, which will see me zipping between rival tribes and monsters, hitting them with special moves, all while slow-mo is liberally applied to emphasize its most awesome moments.Your class choice will determine a set number of unique abilities you will have, though mostly every other ability can be obtained regardless of which class you occupy, save for some which are restricted to those with Light or Dark Auras. Classes are traditional RPG fare, from the ability-heavy ‘Psi-Freak’ to the ranged weapon connoisseur ‘Dead Eye,’ and upgrade points to improve your proficiency in these areas are obtained when you level up. You can also use upgrade points to unlock different special attacks for different categories of weapon, with three of these attacks activating Super Wung Fu mode, in which your damage is amplified and you can pull off additional heavy attacks.All combos are each limited to a few hits, with the inputs required for them handily indicated on the UI. You can start doing cool stuff almost immediately; one of the earliest unlocked abilities allows you to plug a couple of punches into an enemy, before throwing them into the air and spiraling them into the ground with a vicious piledriver. Mostly every special attack feels impactful and looks slick, with the simplicity of its combat system allowing players across all skill levels to string together elegant attacks.But that doesn’t mean Biomutant is an easy ride. Enemies initially take a good deal of punishment before you’re able to take them down, and you shouldn’t expect them to wait for you to pull off an exhaustive combo before they attack back. The likes of Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed may follow Batman Arkham’s counter-heavy lead, and while there is timed parrying here, there are plenty of enemies of various shapes and sizes who won’t care for your dazzling moves and will instead charge right at you. Still, as you progress and level up your abilities and upgrade your weaponry, you eventually feel like an MMO raid boss marching through its landscape, defeating behemothic beasts with wild abandon.However, there are some monsters that will take a much bigger kicking. The four Worldeaters you must face each require you to obtain a special mount to help you take them down, with these battles being unlike anything else you encounter in the game. While none of these encounters are particularly challenging, they make for grand visual spectacles that had me popping open Photo Mode more times than I could count. There’s one boss fight that had a real Godzilla vibe to it, complete with the Worldeater and I crashing through towering buildings as lightning rained down.Outside of the mounts you use to fight the Worldeaters, there are various other animals in the game’s world that you can ride. There are multiple different biological mounts you can befriend with unique designs that range from fluffy and cute to slightly terrifying. My favorite is the Surfipelago Gnoat, an unsettling horse creature with glowing white eyes and an uncannily human face. It is adorable but it also looks like it would try to kill me in my sleep, which can be said for mostly everything in this beautiful yet strange setting.And Biomutant is beautiful alright. There are a number of biomes to explore, from glorious tropical vistas through to sludgy, oil-covered wastelands. There are remnants of the extinct human civilization in its world, but this isn’t some hopeless, sludge-brown hellscape. Even though the Tree of Life may be struggling, it’s still teeming with color and personality.I loved how I could stand perfectly on the precipice between two completely different environments, both of them with their own unique enemies and design. There are certain areas such as heat zones and radiation zones that require you to build resistance to enter them which contain their own secrets and surprises, and an entire sprawling desert that I only realized I hadn’t ventured into until after completing the game’s story.With this being an open-world game, it’s not without some technical issues, though in my playthroughs these were mostly limited to frame rate drops in certain busy areas. I experienced a couple of visual glitches and one particular error where a side-mission wouldn’t activate correctly, though compared to other games of this scale, it runs great. I experienced a consistent 60 FPS in 4K on PC with the occasional hiccup, but it rarely detracted from the action.One notable bug that I encountered, which I hope is promptly fixed in a post-launch patch, saw the clothing I equipped to handle hazardous zones not increasing my resistance. While there’s specific clothing I could obtain via side-missions that acted as a workaround to this problem, it was still a tedious issue to face, though will presumably be rectified in a future update.Biomutant is a lively, stylish, and downright joyous open-world game that doesn’t get bogged down in the conventions of the genre. There’s no bloated story here, and its vibrant sandbox setting is anything but barren, as I felt compelled to explore every nook and cranny I stumbled upon in its vast, gorgeous world.Its combat and crafting systems combine to create effortlessly cool action with tons of customization options, making your arsenal of weapons feel uniquely your own. While its story may not be its focal point, its narrator and wonderfully odd selection of characters are full of charm, with its morality system and eco-friendly message making me feel like I was a part of a thoughtful children’s fable.Considering Biomutant’s delayed and seemingly troubled road to release, I’m blindsided by just how good it is. Experiment 101 has clearly been afforded the time to see its vision through, something which is unfortunately far too rare in the cutthroat gaming industry. I did not expect this to be one of my favorites of the year so far, let alone one of the most enjoyable open-world games I’ve ever played.

Biomutant,Zoey Handley,Destructoid,https://www.destructoid.com/stories/review-biomutant-629980.phtml,"darkThe open-world genre gives me hesitation these days; it’s almost a bad word. I blame Ubisoft. Not another waypoint! Not another tower to climb! Not another cathedral to parkour through! I’ll get to the main plot soon, I promise! Just a few more collectibles!It’s not that I’m entirely down on the genre. I’ll readily admit to enjoying it. Games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Spider-Man have captured my attention and drawn me in, but to me, it’s like eating a bag of chips; my brain tells me I love it while it’s happening, but almost as soon as I’m done, I feel empty. The expanse of the vacuum varies, but I think even the best open-world games have given me this feeling.What gave me further pause about Biomutant was its protracted development time. It was announced back in 2017, I pre-ordered it in 2019, and here is finally in 2021. Its feature list has always struck me as over-ambitious, especially for a small team like Experiment 101. It was billed as this fully adaptable game that let you make all the decisions in what you do and how you approach the game’s main objectives. I had my doubts that it would deliver, and now that it’s finally here, I can firmly say that no, it doesn’t quite make it. It’s a bag of chips. Delicious, delicious chips.Biomutant (PC [Reviewed], Xbox One, PS4)
Developer: Experiment 101
Publisher: THQ Nordic
Released: May 25, 2021
MSRP: $59.99To be fair, Biomutant truly is a game with a lot of flexibility. You can be a complete jerk or a selfless hero, you can make the world worse off or try to save it, and a lot of the game’s activities are optional in the truest of senses. Success can be achieved, even if you want to partake in one of the game’s main mechanics or not.It’s not true freedom, of course, just freedom within reason. The narrative in Biomutant centers around a post-apocalyptic world struggling for breath. Humanity screwed the environment badly, and the planet’s new inhabitants, the mutated predecessors of our wildlife, have been trying to keep things from getting worse. However, the Tree of Life is dying. A plague is spreading, and a quartet of munsters are eating at its roots. Which is where you come in.You’re some sort of wandering ronin returning to their homeland after considerable time away. Finding the tribes splintered and in turmoil, the Tree of Life withering, and munsters taking over, you set to work getting things back in order. If this means crushing everyone and helping the tree on its way, then have at it, you munster.Mutant is a pretty apt description of Biomutant. At times, it feels like a twisting or mutation of particular formulas. It’s also narratively a bit of an amalgamation. It’s hard not to get a whiff of Breath of the Wild, Fallout, or Far Cry. There’s four munsters divided into the four corners of the map that you can take out at your own pace or just whenever. There are tribes you can unite or destroy or just ignore. You know that territory system where your map has little blotches on it telling you what belongs to what tribe? It’s here.It has RPG mechanics and crafting, there are zones that are hazardous unless you’ve gathered gear and upgraded your character to resist their inflictions. There are munsters to be honted and cosmetic stuff to find for your various vehicles. It’s a big, sloshing bucket full of stew.Which isn’t to say it’s bad or even derivative. It has its own flow, the world has its own feel, it’s just a lot. It’s hard to complain about having so much content, especially in a game that is launching at a bargain price. Every time I’d start feeling like things were becoming routine, it would introduce something surprising that I hadn’t been expecting. I’d be going through a graveyard and suddenly be assaulted by skeletons or I’d find ruins that contain a gameplay mechanic I didn’t even know about. It tries to excite at every corner, and it largely succeeds.There was even one particular moment where I got that feeling like I was playing through someone else’s fetish, which was a little discomforting. I don’t know, maybe it’s supposed to be innocuous and I’ve just spent too much time on the internet.The mutation comes from the fact that not every facet got the same amount of love. The alignment system, for example, either needed to be cut or polished. On the surface, it’s pretty typical: release the prisoner or punch them in the face for no reason aside from the chance to be a dick. That’s disappointing in its own right, but the larger issue is that you’re mostly just collecting good and bad karma, and that’s it. Sure, characters will call you a dick if you’re a dick, but let me explain.Most of the time in Biomutant you’re just deciding whether or not you want the good points or the bad points. Spare a tribe’s Sifu or lock them up. Destroy a tribe or bring them into the fold. Release prisoners or give a speech about something. It’s nothing meaningful. It could have been something like siege a tribe outpost until they starve or challenge the Sifu to single combat, but it’s not. And sometimes I’d trip across dick actions by accident. I walked up to boxes of food and got the “interact” prompt, and when I pressed it, my guy just burned the boxes for no reason. It would take a long time to upset my karma ratio, it’s just out of character for a hero character.The tribes are another half-baked mechanic. Three want to unite the tribes and save the world, the other three want to destroy the tribes and end the world. There aren’t two in-betweens, those are your options. You’re also forced into joining one of two tribes at the beginning of Biomutant (even though advertising says the tribe war is optional), but you can then join another tribe at the cost of betraying your current one. I did this by accident. I just wanted to ask one of the other friendly tribes if they wanted to unite, and the next thing I knew, I had to retake territory I took for my previous tribe.It’s a lot of open-world weirdness. I’d have difficulty naming one of these games that doesn’t have disappointingly raw mechanics floating around, I just kind of expect it at this point, but Biomutant is a game so crammed with content that you go from dizzying highs to nauseating lows pretty frequently.It’s that pervasive smell of, “we eventually need to release this game.” At some point — and maybe this was dictated at a corporate level, but it had to happen — they had to take all the pieces they had and put it together into a complete, playable experience. That means some of it is extremely good, and some of it is barely worth doing, and the fact that it’s all stirred together means that you can’t have the good without tripping into the bad.I could honestly write an essay on all the little ways that Biomutant disappointed me, but I’d lose even the bravest soul around the 4,000 word mark and everyone else would just scroll straight to the score anyway. I wish the narrator would shut up every once and a while. There’s actually a slider for his frequency, but I’d swear it didn’t do anything. He’d still remind me it’s night three times a night. It’s also stupid easy. I don’t play open-world games for their challenge, but after I realized I never used healing items, I kicked the difficulty up to hard. Then I created a gun that eliminated the remaining challenge.So, yeah, I can gripe about Biomutant’s shortcomings until the gnoats come home, but I feel that would give the impression that I didn’t like the game. On the contrary, I really enjoyed it. Exploring its world was a joy, finding a new “ultimate weapon” that I could take apart and turn into an even better weapon was always exciting, and it kept providing new experiences throughout its runtime. The combat is fun, allowing you to mix and match different abilities to find the best way to inflict pain. It also does a good job of leaving it up to you how you tackle the game, providing a bevy of options and just letting you choose what you want to do.It’s just got a lot of loose screws, which is horrifying to see on a roller coaster, but not quite the same omen of death in a video game. I think the team did the best they could putting all the little pieces together, and the amount of content that resulted is dizzying for a bargain priced title developed by a small team. I honestly think that Biomutant’s potential isn’t going to be fully realized until a sequel, spiritual or otherwise, but what’s here is perfectly entertaining.I had a lot of trouble tearing myself away from Biomutant, and a lot of my grievances didn’t really surface until I’d finished it and had time to digest. Before that, I was absorbed in exploring its well-designed world, plumbing ruins, collecting dopey looking mounts, and dressing like I just survived a landfill explosion. There are some unwanted mutations in its genes, but they’re covered in fur and easy to overlook.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]GreatImpressive efforts with a few noticeable problems holding them back. Won't astound everyone, but is worth your time and cash.

Biomutant,Donovan Erskine,Shacknews,https://www.shacknews.com/article/124507/biomutant-review-wung-fu-warriors,"New to Shacknews? Signup for a Free AccountAlready have an account? Login NowExperiment 101 and THQ Nordic's Biomutant looks to deliver a truly unique open-world RPG.Nearly four years after it was first announced, and about six years since it first went into development, Biomutant is finally being released. The debut title from developer Experiment 101, this open-world RPG is set in a post-apocalyptic world filled with some gnarly looking creatures. While it’s certainly an enjoyable time, there are some ideas that don’t come to fruition in Biomutant.In Biomutant, players take on the role of a small furry creature, who is destined to be the hero of this post-apocalyptic world. The game’s character creator is pretty extensive, as players select their breed and choose their base stat spread. Something neat about the character creation progress is that the base attributes that players choose will impact their character’s physical appearance. For example, increasing your intellect will literally give you a bigger head.There’s a variety of classes in the game, which allow players to specialize in different gameplay styles, whether that be the sharpshooting abilities of the Dead-Eye, or the magical powers harnessed by the Psi-Freak. Although players do indeed align themselves with a class at the beginning of the game, your choice isn’t set in stone. In fact, the class you select is more of a way to get players started on a desired path. You’re free to upgrade and pursue a playstyle in any of the different classes in Biomutant, regardless of what you choose at the start.The main story in Biomutant revolves around the Tree of Life, which appropriately gives life to the world inhabited by our protagonist. After it’s put in jeopardy by an oil spill as well as deadly creatures known as World Eaters looking to consume its roots, the player will find themselves caught in the middle of a fight for the future of the entire world. There are six tribes that players will encounter, each with their own motives in relation to The Tree of Life. Half of the tribes seek to destroy the World Eaters and save the tree, while the other half look to aid the creatures in destroying it, as they believe the world needs to be cleansed so civilization can start from scratch.Players will have the option to align themselves with one of the factions present in Biomutant. Siding with one of the light side factions will set the player’s end goal to saving The Tree of Life, while siding with a dark faction will set the goal to destroying the tree. This is where Aura comes in, the game’s constantly evolving moral scale.The decisions players make will directly impact their Aura, either adding more to the light or dark side. Though the whole binary dynamic of good vs bad is something that RPGs have moved on from, it works for Biomutant’s Fable-inspired style.As an RPG, I really like how the branching pathways and Aura shape Biomutant. The way you choose to play is clearly reflected in the world, whether that be allying with and uniting each of the tribes, or striking down all of those who stand in your way. It invites replayability, and makes me eager to see how my journey contrasted from my friends and colleagues.With a wide variety of ways to approach Biomutant from a narrative standpoint, there’s also a lot of ways to approach combat. Melee weapons, guns, and psychic abilities are among the many ways players can take down the array of vicious creatures the game will throw at them. The game’s real-time combat system allows you to adjust on the fly and quickly swap between weapons. I found myself tagging up enemies from a distance with my revolvers, leaping into close-range action to quickly deal some melee damage with my twin sais.Combat in Biomutant is incredibly frenetic, as I was constantly on the move whenever I was in a fight. In addition to dashing and leaping, the game also gives you a double jump that will briefly slow down time. It’s these elements that make combat feel like something from a martial arts film.Players can also acquire and upgrade perks and mutations to their character, in addition to the game’s base attributes. The way the different categories are laid out in the menu felt needlessly intricate, as I was constantly flipping between pages and entering/exiting menus when I wanted to upgrade my Wung-Fu or check out the available mutations.Biomutant’s crafting feature is pretty robust, as players can take the parts they find and match them together to make weapons as well as gear. You can use this to put a rusty handle on your blade, or give your armor that extra flair. It’s not all cosmetic, as parts will also apply statistical bonuses to weapons and armor.Though Biomutant is set in a post-apocalyptic world on the brink of another disaster, the environments are still full of color and brimming with energy. It’s refreshing to have a game of this nature that isn’t visually dreary and flushed out. The game is gorgeous, and the use of camera focus makes every battle feel cinematic. That said, it’s a bit of a shame that the world itself can feel boring at times.The world in Biomutant is fairly large, with unique regions to discover and explore. However, the game suffers a bit from open-world syndrome, where a lot of areas between the points of interest don’t feel all that interesting. Sure, there are minibosses to take down, as well as loot and collectibles to find, but most of my time in the open-world was spent getting from point A to B. I wish there was more meat to the exploration aspect of Biomutant.Biomutant is a solid debut from Experiment 101. Though a couple of the game’s concepts don’t feel entirely fleshed out, there’s still a lot to appreciate. The amount of variety in both the narrative and in combat ensures that no two players have an identical experience. With a fluid combat system and enough style to spare, Biomutant is still a formidable RPG.This review is based on a Steam code provided by the publisher.

					I didn't think it looked that good from gameplay videos but was willing to see if the reviews were good... I think I'll be waiting on this one. Ask me tomorrow though as I'll probably be weak as fuck and just get it anyway.				
					Damn, looks like the extra development time didn't save it... DAMNIT!!!!!!				
					I gotta say this never looked all that interesting to me. *shrug*				
					I've been watching streamers play it today and it looks pretty fun! I preordered it. I feel like I will enjoy it.				
					Looks very GW2 style combat sorta, or Wildstar, which I loved both. 				
					holy shit.....i memba Wildstar            0_0				
					Dude, I loved WildStar. I was totally into it. My friends couldn't get into it though and went back to other things like WoW. I tried to keep playing as long as I could, but it eventually died. Wish it was still around as F2P but it's gone. :(

					I played a few hours of Knockout City and then immediately got the full version as I know I'm playing this longer.  Only problem is I have no friends to play with and nobody uses voicecomms :(				
					Yea, I really wanted another open world game to play but every single video I watch the combat just looks really samey and boring, and it looks like that's most of what you do in the game Bleh

					I feel like the marketing for this game went nuts in the past month. I went from never having heard of it, to seeing ""random people"" talking about it on Reddit quite frequently, to Conan O'Brien doing a Clueless Gamer segment. It looks cool but I think people are just really thirsty for a new quality IP.

Biomutant,Mick Fraser,God is a Geek,https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/biomutant-review/,"May 25, 2021As I ploughed my way through Biomutant and its mass of oddly saccharine content I couldn’t help but equate Experiment 101’s sprawling RPG with a big, colourful piñata. With every firm but light-hearted smack across its papier-mache arse it spewed out more little treats and tidbits and brightly-coloured flashy things, and the more it spewed, the more I hit it, and the more I hit it, the more queasy I became, and yet I found I couldn’t stop ’til I’d beaten it into a shredded pulp and gorged myself on its offerings until the room was spinning.My point here is that there is a lot of stuff to do in Biomutant. Like, a massive amount, but I hasten to add that I cannot knock the ambition behind Biomutant. Evidently Experiment 101 at some point held a brainstorming session during which someone switched all the waters with high-sugar energy drinks and hid the board rubbers. From the outset you’re populating your map with flashing icons, and you’ll still be finding new stuff after 20 hours.But if Biomutant is living proof of anything, it’s that there really is such a thing as too much of a muchness. From the moment you open up the character creation screen, it begins hurling silly words and nonsensical terms at you and it rarely stops. Your first task is to create a custom rodent-like hero from a bunch of presets which you can then fine tune with sliders. My little white and blue rat-rabbit only took a few minutes to create, as I was quite happy to sling all my initial points into Vitality and Agility and select the Saboteur class, because dual-wielding makeshift guns and blades sounded cool.The classes on offer represent the usual RPG fare such as the Commando who does more damage with rifles and the Psi-Freak, who can wield Biomutant’s form of magic like a wizard. Thing is, it doesn’t matter much, because it doesn’t take long to realise that one thing Experiment 101 weren’t interested in was creating a challenge.Much noise has been made about Biomutant’s combat being based loosely on the frenetic bloodletting in Devil May Cry, and I can certainly see the similarities there, in the same way I can see the similarities between the driving in Forza and the driving in Crash Team Racing. Because while Biomutant’s combat definitely looks great in trailers, in practice it’s a little less impressive.It’s nice to be cartwheeling around bad guys and seamlessly mixing melee and ranged combat, but it’s nicer when you can feel the impact of each blow and sadly, Biomutant just doesn’t deliver punchy, exciting combat. Yes, you can flip about the place and employ a form of magic, and yes there’s more slow motion action than Zack Snyder filming a fight between two OAPs in a vat of treacle, but there’s rarely anything to force you to use your entire arsenal. The free-class system allows you to pump points into whichever stat you like, and so by around 10 hours in I’d ditched the dual blades for a whacking great sword that poisoned my enemies, and a rifle that I haven’t had to swap out for the 25 hours since equipping it.There’s an argument here that things are only as fun as you make them, and I suppose you could throw caution to the wind and wade in with your dukes up, but there’s absolutely no penalty for circle-strafing every single enemy while shooting them until they catapult off in slow motion. You’ll rarely take a solid hit, let alone die. A lack of weight to the melee combat leaves the experience looking pretty but feeling hollow, and despite trying to engage with it in a meaningful way on multiple occasions I struggled to see any encounter as more than an obstacle between me and Biomutant’s beautiful, loot-filled world.Rarely outside a Ubisoft sandbox have I seen a map so densely packed with places to explore and secrets to uncover. You can’t run for more than 30 seconds in any direction without coming upon another abandoned intersection, dilapidated house, underground bunker or secret vault. A little checklist accompanies each new area, helpfully marking off anything you find until you’re told the area is complete and you know there’s nothing else to search for. A chirpy little automaton is an ever-present companion, ready to fight beside you (sort of), and narrate everything in the voice of a kindly uncle. At least I think it’s the automaton who’s supposed to be talking.In fact there’s a lot of Biomutant I still don’t fully understand. Set in a world that has survived an environmental apocalypse courtesy of the Toxanol Corporation, whose disregard for the planet’s health led to the end of civilisation, Biomutant presents a fairly dark story that often feels at odds with its attempts at humour and levity. The narrator, for example, rarely shuts up, and even translates the grunts and whistles of the NPCs you’ll meet, while character and enemy names run the gamut from harmlessly weird to downright unpronounceable, which in turn makes them thoroughly forgettable. Not a good thing in a game that gives you so, so much to think about.The world is split into separate biomes, each controlled by one of six warring tribes. Initially you’ll be asked to choose one of two sides to work with, and will wage war upon the other. You can choose to be ruthless or merciful, which will affect your Aura and decide whether you – and, by extension, the world – leans towards light or dark. This affects various things, such as which NPCs will give you side quests, which monsters you’ll encounter frequently and which characters will accept a seat on the Ark. The Ark, by the way, is a ship ready to carry you away from the world if your attempts to save it fall to ruin.The similarities between Biomutant and Breath of the Wild are evident almost immediately. You have a glider, for instance, and must find specific hazard protection suits to survive in hostile areas. But an even greater similarity is the structure of the campaign. This sees you tackling four huge bosses in different corners of the map in order to remove the corruption from the world. This and the tribal war are the main driving factors behind Biomutant’s slightly disjointed story.This leads to you repairing and manning various vehicles such as a mech and a submarine to do battle with the World-Eaters. Even these campaign elements are too easily beaten, however, boiling down to fetch quests and short fights. Only one gave me any trouble and that was more down to iffy design than real difficulty. And sometimes merely suggesting that the leader of a rival Outpost simply not fight you. This works far too often and too easily.I had more fun exploring the world and playing with loot than I did tackling the story. The crafting in Biomutant is pretty cool. While you can collect armour (and there’s so much of it) for each part of your body, including a backpack and face mask to wear as well as your helmet or hat, you won’t find half as many weapons. Instead you’ll find parts everywhere that you can use, on the fly, to make new gear from scratch. It’s an excellent system, but while there are outfit slots for quick-changing your armour and clothing, it would have been handy to have a similar system to switch weapon compositions on the move – especially as you spend so much time in the saddle of something or other as you explore.There are gorgeous, colourful meadows, scorching deserts, frozen wastelands, and dense jungles on offer here. Biomutant’s world is vibrant, bustling and full to bursting. Settlements dotted here and there present new side quests, vendors and upgrade stations for your gear. Hidden caverns go deep underground and hide precious loot for your furry little fingers. An impressive draw distance grants you glimpses of far-off treasure troves that you’ll glide, ride, fly or swim to, and a huge variety of weird and wonderful monsters lurks in the shadows. Oh, and it’s not often a game offers you a huge mechanical hand as a mount, complete with a powerful finger-cannon, so there’s that.It’s quite easy to get around the world using fast travel points, which you pee on to activate, because why not? The spacing is sometimes a little odd, given that some are so close you can see one from the other. Elsewhere, some are so far apart you’re desperate to find one by the time you do. But you will zip around the map awful lot, mostly on fairly mundane fetch quests, or to tick things off the long, long side-quest checklist. Most old-world gadgets you can find such as telephones, TVs, and computers will require you to solve a fairly rudimentary puzzle. There are a few different types, but they’re all super simple to overcome. Ancient gym equipment, on the other hand, will improve your physical attributes after a brief bout of button mashing.Biomutant doesn’t really do anything wrong, in that it accomplishes most of what it sets out to do. As an open-world RPG it may be a little too easy for genre veterans, and as a looter it certainly showers you with a ton of the stuff in a huge array of rarities. But it does struggle in the two areas that arguably matter most: combat and story. The world itself is great to explore, peppered with things to find and people to meet – but there’s almost too much of it at times.It’s also worth noting that even though I played on PC, Biomutant hasn’t been fully optimised for “next-gen” yet. This means the load times between areas or deaths are pretty long. I also encountered noticeable slow down after loading into an area, and occasional drops in frame rate. Usually these issues cleared up fairly quickly, but they’re worth a mention.If you’re going to be guilty of anything, then “too much ambition” is hardly a negative. Biomutant is a genuinely enjoyable adventure that suffers primarily from being too stuffed-to-the-gills and a little bit tonally pendulous. The combat isn’t “bad”, but it misses the mark where it counts. The laboured, none-too-original story is balanced out by the inventive world. Whether Biomutant clicks with you or not, the simple truth is that, although you may well feel a pang of the familiar now and then, you’ve almost certainly never played anything like it.Looks gorgeous
Superb crafting
Lots to see and doCombat is too loose
Story feels disjointed
Long, long load timesBiomutant is a game that overreaches early, and spends the rest of its run time trying, mostly successfully, to regain its balance. It's lovely to look at and its world is a joy to explore, boots on the ground, but the combat lacks impact and precision, and technical issues mar the experience.

Biomutant,Victor Vellas,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/biomutant-review/,"Within my first hour of playing Biomutant, the thoughts and feelings I had were those of 17 years ago, when I first booted up Fable on my original Xbox. The brand new IP from THQ Nordic, developed by Experiment 101, is undoubtedly inspired from games of the past, in a good way. At its core it is a huge, open-world action RPG with a lot of decision making and even more conflicts between the Tribes and NPCs that inhabit this lush world. Very similar to the title I mentioned above, barely scratching the surface though in regards to the inspirations it has from other games. If you combine Fable’s vibe and freedom of actions, elements of the Batman Arkham series’ combat and Mass Effect’s Paragon and Renegade system, you have yourself the odd love-child that is called Biomutant.You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic Earth, where pretty much everything has gone to waste. Your goal, eventually, is to end the reign of World Eaters, gigantic beasts that are destroying anything that happens to block their path and have proved their dominance over the more civilized creatures. The Tree of Life is what remains as a source of life in this desolate planet, and you will be the only one who can prevent World Eaters from destroying that as well.There are toxic power plants and radioactive areas all over the place. Not to mention the icy-cold locations that disregard any kind of natural laws, or places completely overtaken by unbearable heat. As such, the most hellish environments imaginable. Even if that’s the case though, oddly enough, the majority of the map in Biomutant is full of greenery and beautiful scenery. While yes, there are ruined towns and villages everywhere, past those lie some really pretty places to explore and even wildlife to either tame or just interact with. When you think of a world where everything reached this state, bright colors and joyful creatures are the least that would pop in your mind.This fact alone makes the world of Biomutant a blast to explore and traverse through. Sometimes you will scavenge for items in deserted towns, while others you will find yourself stuck in a tunnel trying to find an exit, slicing through a bunch of enemies. There will be occasions where you will be having the time of your life riding a mount, traversing through a fascinating forest, only to end up to a drained power plant full of radioactive beings with no other goal than to hurt you. You will even unlock certain vehicles that let you pass through oil-filled hills, or even the sea itself. Those areas have their own dangers and treasures, so if one thing is for certain in Biomutant, is that you will always have this feeling of excitement in regards to what you will bump into next in your adventure.A lot of characters are eagerly waiting to meet you in Biomutant. And I’m saying this quite literally. Your character is a heavily customizable, furry little mammal-like fella, who actually has already built a reputation for himself over the years. In fact, this reputation will be based on your actions throughout your journey and depending on what were they, NPCs everywhere will address you as such. If you go down the let’s say ‘aggressive’ route, everyone will keep mentioning how much of a threat you are and that even you can have a change of heart further down the line. If you however chose to help people and act as a neighborhood hero, they will all admire you and treat you with respect. Whatever the case may be, as I mentioned, characters in towns and pretty much everywhere will be able to recognize you in the most part, especially those that are associated with Tribes.These Tribes are the game’s factions, and there are six of them in total. Three of them are associated with the way of the Light, while the rest with the Dark side. Or to be more precise, Light and Dark Aura if we want to be on par with Biomutant’s terminology. This Aura is also a part of you and the more actions you take on behalf of one side, you will gather points respectively. Tribes will further boost your tendency towards any of the two Auras, by giving you quests and tasks leaning more to their side. You will be able to join one of the two Tribes that will appear in the beginning, one sitting in the Dark spectrum, while the other in the Light, but as you progress more into the story and you encounter the rest of the Tribes, you may change your allegiance to any of them accordingly. The important thing to note here, is that both sides have different end-goals, which will eventually lead to a different ending. As such, don’t treat the Tribe selection lightly.All of the choices highlighted above, do matter. Every action you take will have consequences down the line, that being a small choice between helping a poor farmer or not, to the bigger ones like which Tribe to join and how to handle their affairs. You will find yourself capturing enemy Outposts, owned by another Tribe, in order to increase your own Tribe’s field of reign. Even if that’s the case though, in the end you may decide to not do this anymore or even spare an enemy leader, which contradicts to a Dark Tribe’s usual behavior of handling opposing threats and vice versa. It really comes down to how you, the player, want to experience the game and Experiment 101 ensured for us to have the freedom of doing so.While most of your time will be spent on exploring vast areas and picking up items from daily-life objects like closets and refrigerators, combat will be the game’s true selling point. Being an action-RPG, Biomutant has the player slicing his way through a great variety of enemies, with very unique abilities and Wung-Fu. There are all sorts of weird Mutations you can unlock as well, that act as offensive tools. You can throw vomit to the ground to poison enemies, spawn a rocky fist from below to send them flying, or even cover yourself with a giant bubble field so that you can trample over smaller enemies and beasts. After all, you are a mutated being, so why not take advantage of it?Your traditional swords and pistols are here as well, but by utilizing the very easy-to-learn craft system Biomutant offers, you can dual-wield a pair of toilet brushes or even throw a barrage of bullets using a trumpet. You find weapon parts by exploring, earning them from quests, or even buying them from vendors which you can then combine to create something completely unique. The amount of weapons you can end up with is ridiculous, especially in terms of how they look. They can even have passive abilities implemented to them, if your materials do have one included to their kit. Overall, the amount of tools you have in combat is very generous, and since you can customize your main character to your liking and choose the class you prefer the most as well, there is a ton of different setups you can try out. With five different classes (and one as paid DLC making it a total of six) there will be something for everyone’s playstyle of choice.Combat itself is taking place in real-time, right after you encounter any kind of enemies. You can jump into a fist-fight, use your melee weapon up-close and personal, use your guns for a ranged showdown, or embrace your inner Sith Lord and use your Levitate ability to fly around and shoot lightning bolts. It all comes down to how you want to fight, and whatever method you choose, is equally efficient. I do have some complaints for when you just begin your adventure, since it is obvious that certain types of combat don’t really do well, in comparison to others. Melee combat for example is really lackluster in the beginning, when you don’t have strong weapons or a good variety of abilities at your disposal. More often than not I ended up relying on my extremely efficient gun, which was the reason I could live some confrontations. Let me also add that my character was created and customized as a melee fighter, with a lot of extra points to strength and agility, so it’s not like I wasn’t ready for it.Fortunately enough, this is not the case for long. After you’ve put some hours into Biomutant, the game does speed up a lot. You find items way faster, you unlock a lot of different abilities all the time and you gain levels on a steady pace. After I managed to craft some really good one-handed weapons (a small knife attached to a bone and a suction cup glued on a katana handle), and enhanced them with the toxic and ice element, things were way different. What I realized though, was that it wasn’t the weapons that mattered that much, but the amount of experience I have gathered after a while and the new techniques I had available. Due to how the combat felt from up close, I started using my assault rifle as a main weapon for a good portion of the game. I unlocked some new Wung-Fu and techniques in the process, tried melee combat again and it was a new me. This was heavily satisfying, as I managed to see my progress into this dangerous world, and how much my main character has changed from when I passed that tutorial phase in the beginning.Biomutant is true to its nature and follows the open-world trope by heart. For this reason, it’s hard to talk about every aspect of the game in detail, since it would make this review so long it would hurt anyone’s eyes. That said, I had a good while to experience a game of this genre that I am invested this much to its world and characters, not to mention its brilliant mix of different types of combat and the easy to approach crafting system.Playing Biomutant made me think of simpler times, when I just turned my game console on and started playing without a care in this world, or in any world at all. It was me, my old-school 30″ TV and the game in front of me, nothing more, nothing less. While it for sure has some flaws like a slow start, some combat junkiness at first and a couple of cut-scenes that look low budget-ish, by no means they hinder the end result of this great action-RPG. If these weren’t present, a perfect score could have been very possible. This game was reviewed using a copy of the game provided by the game's publisher,public relations company, developer or other for the express purpose of a review.

Genre: Action/RPGPlagued by performance issues and graphical glitches, THQ Nordic's Biomutant launched last spring to mixed reviews. On top of its technical shortcomings, the open-world action-RPG received criticism for delivering a merely average gameplay experience, which failed to stand out in the competitive genre.Just over a year later, the kung-fu-fueled, post-apocalyptic adventure returns with a fresh coat of polygons on the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5. The souped-up title also squashes bugs, delivers peppier load times and even makes the rodent-like protagonist's fur look more realistic. More than an incremental update, Biomutant's current-gen version represents the definitive edition of the title.While both current-gen consoles benefit from the updated perks, Biomutant brings a bit more to the PS5. Specifically, the game leverages the DualSense controller, upping the level of immersion via the device's adaptive triggers, haptic feedback and built-in speaker. Read on for our full Biomutant review.Like many games that debuted on last-gen consoles, Biomutant received an upgraded version for current-gen consoles. And as with similar titles, its update is a free download for players who previously purchased the game on Xbox One or PlayStation 4.Whether you've already played the game, or are discovering Biomutant for the first time, you'll enjoy a consistently smooth and graphically impressive experience. The first thing that struck me was the fur covering my post-apocalyptic protagonist. This fur could give Ratchet's soft, supple coat a run for its bolts. Slick lighting and detailed textures look equally impressive, doing their part to bring the game's vibrant, varied world to life.This all comes courtesy of the game's new 4K resolution, HDR enhancements and faster frame rates. The PS5 version offers three modes: Quality (30 frames per second at 4K) Quality Unleashed (40+ fps at up to 4K) and Performance (60 fps at 1440p). I stuck with the middle, best-of-both-worlds option, and felt more than satisfied with the visual clarity and frame rate speed.The game's DualSense integration also works well, producing plenty of sounds and vibrations. Biomutant makes liberal use of this tech, during everything from chaotic combat, to quiet puzzle-solving challenges, to dialogue-heavy character encounters. However, the DualSense features still don't pack the detail or depth I've experienced in other games. There are some nuanced exceptions, such as the satisfying rattle of an old projector's film reels from the speaker. But overall, the feedback feels a bit generic and superfluous.Beyond the aforementioned upgrades, Biomutant also seems more stable. I never experienced a crash or progress-blocking bug. Even minor, occasional glitches – such as graphical pop-in and clipping — weren't prevalent enough to pull me out of the experience. Toss in lightning-quick load times, and the PS5 enhancements generally work as advertised.Biomutant's world, its inhabitants and their ecological survival tale were some of the original release's best elements. The story wasn't deep, nor did it add anything to the real-world conversation about corporate greed and the consequences of ignoring earth's pollution problem. But the game still offered a relatively novel take on the post-apocalypse.Trading the genre's typical ""nuclear annihilation"" plot for humanity's planet-neglecting irresponsibility not only set the stage for fresh storytelling, but also informed the look and feel of the world and its denizens. The furry, pawed population in Biomutant is more aesthetically creepy than cute, but I nevertheless enjoyed the dystopian setting, full of creatures who have survived and thrived, evolving into humanoids with special powers, abilities and smarts.In addition to featuring a clever cast of anthropomorphs, Biomutant organically ties its bizarre characters to the story, world and gameplay. The Sludge Soaker you battle early on, for example, hasn't just lived through an oil spill; it's adapted the hazardous substance to thwart threats. Other baddies have made similar adjustments, such as using the doors of abandoned vehicles as shields.The sorry state of the world benefits the player as well, as the protagonist continually exploits it to power special skills and abilities. Oversized mushrooms can launch the hero upward or send foes flying, while other mutations leverage toxic waste and radioactive materials to deliver serious damage. These examples only scratch the surface, but the game does a great job tying its polluted-planet setting to its story and characters.The look of the world follows suit, forgoing the usual muted color palettes for a varied, vibrant map that doesn't make the end of the world seem so bad. Sure, there are dilapidated cities that wouldn't look out of place in the Last of Us' dreary world. But among the destroyed buildings and abandoned cars, you'll spy colorful banners and billboards, complete with cute mascots, such as a smiling bowl of ramen. Biomutant's world might be destroyed, but it's not depressing.As appealing as the presentation is, it does have some immersion-breaking flaws. Long-winded dialogue exchanges feel more tedious than charming. Characters also speak in a gibberish your robo-insect companion translates for you. It's an inventive touch, but one that will make you want to spam the ""skip"" button.Cutscenes also lack polish, containing awkward, jarring edits, as well as clunky transitions in and out of gameplay. For all the graphical and performance improvements that the current-gen makeover brings, it seems to have entirely skipped over refining the second-rate cinematics. I also encountered several audio issues, such as complete silence when my hero was flailing its arms in the water.Biomutant is brimming with systems and mechanics, from myriad combat options to a staggering array of RPG features. The game is undeniably ambitious, but also feels like it shot for the stars, only to just barely clear the clouds.Battles, for example, encourage you to unleash a creative, combo-driven variety of melee, ranged and magic-like abilities. Mixing and matching the various skills is fun in the game's early hours, when the upgrade systems and character progression paths still hold so much potential. But after hours of leveling up, unlocking weapons and abilities, and investing the game's various currencies to evolve my build, I found that simply utilizing the same few moves over and over was just as effective.Most fights don't pack much of a figurative punch. Targeting is imprecise, attacks lack impact and the controls feel loose. Combat feels light and floaty, rather than weighty and sticky. Toss in a camera that frequently gets caught behind objects, and battling the large cast of mutated enemies just isn't as much fun as it could be. Boss battles offer glimpses of potential, but in general, combat lacks the same creativity and polish that went into building Biomutant's inspired world.Other elements of the game feel similarly uninspired, from its mission structure and morality system, to its puzzles and various upgrade paths. It all works, but it rarely delivers anything novel or unexpected. There are exceptions, such as a crafting system that captures the feel of cobbling together post-apocalyptic scrap. But most of the time, you're merely going through the motions, engaging in activities that other games have done better. None of it is terrible, but the systems rarely rise above ""adequate.""Thanks to a PS5 upgrade that improves the game's performance and prettifies the presentation, Biomutant looks and runs better than ever. It also offers a fresh twist on post-apocalyptic tropes. This welcome approach not only informs the story, but also spawns an imaginative world full of colorful characters and creative creature designs.However, the gameplay in Biomutant rarely lives up to its promise. Clunky, repetitive combat is the worst offender, betraying the potential of the many character-building options. There's also a smorgasbord of RPG systems and mechanics that tick the expected boxes, but do little to stand out from the crowd.Biomutant is an ambitious offering, clearly built by passionate developers. And while it pales in comparison to genre giants, such as Ghost of Tsushima or Horizon Forbidden West, it also comes from a significantly smaller team, at a fraction of the budget.It's not a bad game, but Biomutant would have benefited from more polish and less lofty aspirations. Despite its warts, it's a serviceable, occasionally inspired, action/RPG will capably scratch the genre itch until God of War Ragnarok hits.Sony’s PSVR 2 is not a flop — here’s the proofiPad mini 7 just tipped for performance upgradeForget Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 and Z Flip 5 — the Z Fold 6 and Flip 6 could see major changesBy Mike ProsperoApril 10, 2023By Michelle Rae UyApril 09, 2023By Tony PolancoApril 07, 2023By Matthew MurrayApril 07, 2023By Brian NadelApril 05, 2023By Peter WolinskiApril 05, 2023By Jackie DoveApril 05, 2023By Kelly WooApril 05, 2023By Dan CavallariApril 04, 2023By Andrew HaywardApril 04, 2023By Tony PolancoApril 04, 2023Tom's Guide is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Biomutant,Cassie Peterson,GamingTrend,https://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/biomutant-review-2-0-biomutant-for-next-gen-but-is-it-really-an-upgrade/,"When Biomutant released last May (2021) it was met with generally positive but still mixed reviews. The game appeared to be a mash-up of a few different games like Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild, Horizon Zero Dawn, and Devil May Cry. Our review from last year pointed out all of the charm and quirkiness Biomutant has to offer while also touching on some of its shortcomings. My own review may not be technically comparable since I played on console whereas before it was reviewed for PC, sometimes the platform can make all the difference. However I’d still like to take a look at how my playthrough compares to some of the opinions of yesteryear.Yesteryear just seems like the appropriate term to use here, especially given the narration of the game. Your character isn’t verbal, of course, instead the story is being told by a narrator. There’s a lot of story to tell as well, though it did sometimes feel a little discombobulated. It felt like the story actually revolved around the rivaling factions more than the impending doom of the world. but it then suddenly launches into anecdotes about the main character’s past, the history of this dying world, and the stories of those you came into contact with. They all paint a beautiful and also emotional picture that’s sure to tug at your heartstrings a little.During some of these narrations you are also randomly cut off from whatever you are doing to launch into a cinematic/cutscene should you have arrived at your destination. I’d be running up on a totem or something I wanted to go digging through only to have the game freeze slightly, go to a black screen for a second or two, and then the narrator would start to chime in as the ‘camera’ pans over whatever scene was prevalent. Honestly, I just found it to be inconvenient and could’ve been done better by simply having a prompt come up to ‘observe’ whatever it was they wanted to point out instead of causing a small panic when the screen suddenly goes dark.The world this game takes place in is still as beautiful and colorful as ever. Despite being a game with a highly detailed world that’s also teaming with wildlife, there weren’t any graphical bugs, no pop-in, and I never had to worry about dropped frames. Much like Breath of the Wild or Immortals Fenyx Rising, some of the smaller details slowly fill in the closer you get to an object instead of chunkily materializing, which I have seen a lot of in some other games like Horizon Forbidden West. My only complaint with the graphics is that the darker areas are almost too dark, and that’s with me playing at a higher than recommended brightness level. I love exploring caves and tunnels, but they are so hard to see, even though your character has a shoulder-mounted flashlight to help out.Personally, I had no issues with staying on track with the main story missions. My primary objective was always displayed on screen with a clearly marked waypoint in the distance, which I greatly appreciated because it’s so easy to get lost for possibly hours doing side missions. I love open-world games, but sometimes it feels like they constantly try to pull me away from the main story when all I want to do is play the story. I like that I didn’t feel pressured to go off on those side missions, which would likely end in me getting some subpar piece of equipment that I’d just end up scrapping anyway. However, I do still get easily sidetracked in those tunnels and caves. I like shiny stuff.As far as the gameplay is concerned, Biomutant is as smooth as butter on fresh toast. Movement is easy, combat feels like a mix of hack-and-slash and the same style points kind of combat you find in games like Bayonetta and Devil May Cry, and the controller adaptations are super fun and easy to manage. My only gripe here is that sometimes I would call my mount over to me and it would get stuck in a fence, in between a couple benches, or just something that was too close to some other thing, and then I would have to go on a lengthy jog before I could try to summon them again. The mounts are adorable, by the way.There are parts of the game I simply ignored. Something I found kind of odd was that there are skills that you can acquire, but I’d go to acquire said skills and the majority of them are already unlocked, resulting in points not getting used. There were also things I just simply did not care to unlock, again resulting in unused points. In terms of crafting and upgrades, I often forgot all about this entire part of the game until I would suddenly be reminded about it when finding a good attachment while looting, but even this system felt a little overwhelming, so instead I mostly opted for simply finding a better piece of armor or a better weapon.For a next gen console edition, this version of Biomutant is pretty good, but I wonder if it was even necessary to do it in the first place. Looking at previous reviews of the game, I saw very little complaints regarding game performance or design but more so the content of the story, which I didn’t think was all that bad, if maybe a little off track at times. Overall, I really enjoyed playing this game, and I might even be tempted to try the New Game + mode, something I usually ignore. Either way, if you’ve not played Biomutant but you enjoyed games like Breath of the Wild, Immortals Fenyx Rising, Devil May Cry, and so many others I could mention, definitely give Biomutant a try. You may be as pleasantly surprised as I was.The next generation edition of Biomutant may not have been necessary, but it doesn’t hurt anything either. Overall, the game is very smooth, never dropping a frame no matter how crowded it may become, and the world is as beautiful and colorful as ever. My biggest gripe with the game is pretty universally mentioned: there was a lot more going on in the game than could be given proper attention, such as the upgrade and crafting systems, but it makes up for it in my opinion with a story and a world that is fun to explore.—Cassie PetersonSee below for our list of partners and affiliates:One of the longest running independent gaming news, reviews and culture sites on the web.The thing that is magical about the Wizarding World isn’t the magic – it’s...by Ron BurkeThe world is going to end.

Biomutant,Ron Burke,GamingTrend,https://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/anthrophomorphic-amalgamation-adventure-biomutant-review/,"If you were to ask me what Biomutant is about, I would have a hard time pinning it down. At its core, it’s about a post-apocalyptic world where mutated creatures have inherited the Earth, formed tribes, and now war against one another. You are one of these creatures, aiming beyond the petty squabbles and trying to stop an armageddon event. Beyond that, it’s a mashup of Horizon: Zero Dawn, Devil May Cry, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Borderlands, and a whole lot of others. With a laundry list of influences, Biomutant is a lot of things. Let’s dig into the details and figure out if that mishmash of genres and gameplay mechanics works.Before we set out into the wide open world of Biomutant, we’ll need to make our character. While we almost exclusively saw a single look for the protagonist in the trailers and gameplay leading up to launch, you’ll likely end up looking nothing like that little beastie. Instead, you’ll start off your creation picking between strength, agility, vitality, charisma, and intellect. These have a direct correlation to vitality (health and armor), strength (melee damage), intellect (power, Ki energy, and energy regen), agility (movement speed), charisma (barter effectiveness), and luck (critical and loot chances). As you roll your left thumbstick through these options, your creature will morph and change. A creature with a high intellect will have a larger head, whereas higher vitality will make you more squat and beefy. Strength puts meat on your bones, and charisma makes your head wide, for some reason.Beyond the primary stats, you’ll also choose your breed of anthropomorphic critter — there are six to choose from, each altering the overall look of your character a bit while adding additional bumps or dips to your overall stats accordingly. Finally, you’ll select your class. There are five in the game, with a sixth available if you happened to preorder. These archetypes are truly the differentiators in the game as they’ll set your initial abilities and overall play style, and they couldn’t be more different. Dead-Eye characters have an amazing skill, able to reload instantly and doing 20% additional damage for their next magazine. Commando types are range specialists, with their guns doing 10% more damage to targets. Psi-Freak’s are able to throw a ball of lightning, giving their foes a good jolt from a distance. Saboteur’s are dual wielders, able to use two one-handed weapons simultaneously. Sentinels are all-arounders with additional base armor to keep them out of trouble.Beyond all of these choices you’ll find the most important one — the colors of your critter. Using a wheel with the entire color gamut and brightness settings, you’ll decide if you want your creature to look badass with black and silver, or if you want to stick out like a bright pink and orange road cone. It’s entirely cosmetic, but make your mutant unique — you’ll be spending a lot of time with them — about 25 hours from start to finish.  Let’s take a look at the first hour in 4K at max settings running on an RTX 3080.After completing a quick tutorial, you are off to the races. The game essentially stops holding your hand, instead gating the areas with powers or levels. Unless there’s a hard block, it’s likely you could go essentially wherever you want. This is simultaneously the best and worst part of the game. I found myself shortly very far afield of where I should have been, doing side quests in areas I didn’t belong in, eschewing the main story. I backtracked with the generous fast-travel system and put myself on track, but it speaks to a lack of direction that creeps into the game at times.The first of a great many decisions you’ll make in the game is what tribe to align with, and with it the game introduces the morality system. Any decisions you make can affect your light or dark alignment. Ultimately these culminate in the macro decision whether to save the central Tree of Life or to help destroy it, or they should. Instead, they function to unlock specific Psi powers on one side or the other. This feels like a feature that was planned to be something more ambitious, but ended up being somewhat abandoned.Aligning with a specific tribe means taking down the other one, and that’s going to lead you to the enemy gates. Each base has a limited number of sequences you can execute to take it down, ranging from all-out assault to using insects to drive out the enemy without firing a shot. In the first few hours these are fresh and unique, but towards the end you’ll see these sequences repeat a bit.There are four massive bosses (with entirely too-cute names like “Porky Puff”) that will need to be addressed to save or destroy the Tree of Life. Frankly, they are just too big for you to take on by yourself, so you’ll need to gather up some unique vehicles to help do the job. I don’t want to ruin these for you, but they do reveal another repeated pattern. Even if you are given a base vehicle, you’ll need to collect various parts to build them up to take on the boss, perform a specific ritual, and then you can take them on. The fights are a blast, and I enjoyed every one of them — the running around searching for the parts, less so.Speaking of weapons and collecting, weapons in Biomutant are a bit of what you make them. After an hour or two you’ll likely start to feel like you are behind the power curve, and that’s because you ignored the incredibly deep weapon and armor crafting system. I don’t know why you did that, but let’s talk about it, ok? Nearly every weapon in Biomutant, much like the creatures themselves, are an amalgamation of other things.Every gun, sword, and piece of armor is junk slapped together to make something better. Using an MMO-like rarity system, every piece of a weapon or armor has a rarity and attributes associated with them. Swapping out the handle, body, trigger type, materials, and more can modify the type of damage, amount, armor piercing, fire rate, accuracy, range, reload speed, critical chance, and any special attributes that weapon has. Armor similarly upgrades with various resistances emphasized — a key to gaining damage-free access to places like the radioactive zones. There are nine slots for gear, and five slots to save your favorite combinations, so you’ll have plenty to juggle.As you level up you’ll gain attribute points to allocate, but you’ll also unlock perks. These powers are expansive, giving you access to skills that can help you dispatch foes with abandon. Lobbing fireballs into somebody’s face after you just froze everyone around you is rude, but highly effective. Frankly there are so many to choose from that it’s hard to even encapsulate them here — I cannot imagine the pain of balancing them all, but suffice it to say there are more than a few that will match whatever your playstyle happens to be.Combat in Biomutant is a feat unto itself. If you want to play this game as a brawler, it’s here for you. Want to focus on ranged high-volume guns? Do it. Grenade launchers and daggers? Yes and yes. Magical rat wizard? That looks great on you. Whatever your playstyle, it’s represented and all folds into a paper/rock/scissors resistance system that, unlike many games, actually matters. Paying attention to what’s in front of you, and what weaknesses they possess, while paying attention to your own, is key to survival. I made a comparison to Devil May Cry, and it’s most likely the most direct comparison when it comes to fighting. Melee and ranged attacks mix together with the aforementioned skills and perks to create a character that is uniquely your own.Even enemies feel like they are cobbled together from other foes. Many match your protagonist archetypes, but they are also unique. Better still, there is no telling when you’ll stumble upon them fighting amongst themselves. Big sub-boss creatures roam the land as well, and you’ll encounter them frequently. Frankly, I’m not sure if the team designed hundreds of critters, or if they are being randomly generated, but wow, is there variety.Visually, Biomutant is absolutely stunning. The sense of scale is awe-inspiring, and on PC the draw distances are breathtaking. Looking out over a cliff I can see an abandoned overgrown dam. Looking in another direction I can see the massive Tree of Life, its tentacle-like roots crawling the landscape into the distance. Like Breath of the Wild, each area looks and feels unique, with all of them bringing fresh threats and challenges. Whether it’s dealing with the overbright and dangerous radioactive zones, the smouldering deserts, or the lush and beautiful forests, Biomutant is beautiful.The story of Biomutant is told almost like a Chinese action movie. Frequently your character will stop in the middle of the story and think back to a time past where he learned about a specific move set or gained an item of significance. The names of creatures and places are often a combination of gibberish and how a child might pronounce things — it very much reminded me of the kids in Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome.The narrator telling your story is going to be a divisive element as he is persistent. He’s telling your story as it happens, so he’ll be translating the creature language you hear, talking about the things you discover, and generally talking through the course of the game. You can adjust this down a bit, but for me it’s part of the overall charm of the game. It’s a little like having a book read to you, and it fits the strange aesthetic of the world where Biomutant happens.With rich puzzles, crazy creature design, engaging combat, laugh out loud funny moments (I see you 50’s greaser style Elvis-like ferret!), an engrossing crafting system, character upgrades, Wung-Fu powered super moves, a morality system, 15 perks, and RNG-powered loot drops, Biomutant has it all. This is the best, and also the worst thing about it. The ambitious nature of this title is absolutely staggering. It does a LOT, and it does all of it reasonably well, but none of it great. Developer Experiment 101 have brought together so many elements, it’s a miracle any of it works. Like the weapons I’ve cobbled together, they get the job done, and that’s about it.Riddled with repetition, Biomutant is as grand in ambition as it is bland in execution. Where it shines in character creation and choice, it fumbles in its narrative and empty morality system. Where building your powers, weapons, and toys is great, finding all the parts to do so is simply a chore. Odd to say, but in this case, less might have been more, but what is here is fun. Just not as fun as it could have been.—Ron BurkeSee below for our list of partners and affiliates:One of the longest running independent gaming news, reviews and culture sites on the web.The thing that is magical about the Wizarding World isn’t the magic – it’s...by Ron BurkeThe world is going to end.

Biomutant,Alexander Cope,Windows Central,https://www.windowscentral.com/biomutant-review-xbox-series-x,"No offers foundWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.I'm a fan of games where you play as a creature that breaks the norm of typical videogame protagonists, like playing as a shark in Maneater or an adventurous dragon in the Spyro Reignited Trilogy. So when I heard about this strange game where you get to play as a weird mutant animal shooting guns and riding mechs into battle, I had to check out Biomutant for Xbox Series X, especially since it's on our list of most anticipated upcoming Xbox and PC games.Unfortunately, during my time playing it, I couldn't help but feel uninspired by this game. It attempts many gameplay and narrative ideas, and while many of them do work, so many do not. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's dive into the world of Biomutant and see what this game got right and got not so right.Bottom line: Biomutant has an interesting setting and world but is held back by technical issues, an unintuitive combat system, lack of proper characterization, and very repetitive missions.Biomutant is an open-world, action-RPG set in a post-apocalyptic world populated by mutants of all shapes and sizes. Many years ago, humanity had polluted planet Earth to the point where it became no longer safe for habitation, so they abandoned it. The pollution caused the ecosystems of Earth and the wildlife to mutate drastically. Nature has consumed all the remnants of mankind's cities, reducing them to ruins. Some creatures turned into intelligent humanoids, while others have mutated into giant, towering monsters called Worldeaters.You play as one of these new mutated humanoids — a wandering ronin trying to survive alone in this ruined world. After an intense battle with one of the hostile mutants, a Lupa-Lupin, you encounter a crippled monkey mutant called 'Out-of-Date' who says he needs you to save the planet from the Worldeaters.The Worldeaters are wreaking all sorts of havoc and are trying to consume the Tree of Life, which helps sustain one of the last healthy ecosystems on Earth. If the Worldeaters destroy it, then all is lost. If that wasn't bad enough, the locals have formed small tribes and are too busy fighting each other for supremacy instead of stopping the Worldeaters.Without getting into spoilers, Out-of-Date believes that with your martial-arts skills and mutant abilities, you can unite the warring tribes and defeat the Worldeaters.Your journey begins with a character creator that allows you to customize the look of your mutant and select your class. The class you pick determines what attributes and weapons you start with. For your character's looks, you can edit the fur and physique to make yourself into a cute or monstrous creature straight out of a 90's Saturday morning cartoon. Once you're done, it's time to set out into the world.Biomutant sports a unique post-apocalyptic setting that feels like it's on the road to recovery, populated with new races trying to figure out how to repurpose humanity's discarded technology for their own ends. There are all sorts of unique biomes like lush forests, oxygen-deprived wastelands filled with lakes of tar, and ruined human facilities drowning in radiation. Some of these areas require special equipment that boosts your resistance to environmental hazards, so you don't keel over from radiation poisoning.The crafting and character leveling systems are pretty in-depth. You find weapon parts scattered through the land and combine any of them together to craft a weapon that fits your playstyle. You can craft shotguns to blast enemies at close or craft assault rifles to shoot down enemies at a distance. However, the melee weapons feel a bit samey, despite some of the cool moves that they have.The highlight of the game for me is when you confront the Worldeaters.You can augment your armor with bits of scrap to upgrade its defensive value. You can dismantle equipment you don't want for materials to upgrade your preferred gear or sell them off at the vendors.There is a variety of mutant powers to obtain throughout the course of the game. These include shooting fireballs, shooting lightning, telekinesis, blasting radiation, creating a giant bubble shield, and many more. These powers are acquired by obtaining Bio Points from slaying monsters and awarded Psi-Points after performing good or evil deeds.The highlight of the game for me is when you confront the Worldeaters. Each fight with these cool-looking beasts has their own questline that require different methods to take down. For example, the first Worldeater you will face, Jumpo Puff, requires you to build a giant mech suit to fight it. I like that you can customize its looks with bits of scrap you find in the wasteland. I made mine look like a horrific animatronic you would most likely find in Five Nights at Freddy's.My motivation for this game's story was dashed early on, owing to the game's single narrator explaining everything you see or do. He describes what the characters are saying since they only speak in gibberish, he tells you how your character should feel after making any moral decision, and he even constantly shouts one-liners for you in battle. The endless narration robs the characters of any characterization or personality of their own, robbing any sense that this is your story — arguably crucial in any self-respecting RPG.There's nothing wrong with audio narration when used correctly, but the overabundance of it in Biomutant only serves to reduce the sense of scope in the game's world. This is a game that tells you what's going on, rather than shows you, which gets grating quite quickly. Even after messing with the settings to turn him off, he's still there giving off-color commentary when it isn't needed. I suspect this could become a source of irritation for many who play.Another aspect that turned me off was the very repetitive quests. While there were some interesting quests like the fights with the Worldeaters and raiding the outposts of tribes, most of the quests were generic fetch quests or 'kill this many enemies' quests. I wouldn't normally mind this, but thanks in part to the monotonous narrator, I wasn't really invested in them. The other problem is that the combat just isn't very interesting, either.The combat system is simple for the most part, but some of it is unintuitive. You whack enemies with your melee attacks, shoot from afar with your gun, and occasionally use your mutant powers to inflict status effects on them. I didn't like that you had to wait for an on-screen command prompt before inflicting a heavy attack during a normal melee combo. It puts a damper on creating your combos during a fight, being forced to use only a few combos. Dodging enemies attacks is also weird because you gravitate towards an enemy, which can be detrimental during group fights. I often unintentionally dodge rolled into an enemy offscreen because my dodge roll gravitated me towards them instead of letting me dodge wherever I wanted.The combat system is straightforward, but some of it is unintuitive.Biomutant also has some serious issues with difficulty tuning. On normal mode, Biomutant is often laughably easy, even without optimizing your build. So, I went to Hard Mode to find a better challenge, and it delivered for a while before I started upgrading my gear. It wasn't long before I was able to tank enemies attacks that were several levels above me and the only times I died was due to the unintuitive controls during combat I mentioned before. The lack of any real sense of risk and reward makes grinding through the game's repetitive quests all the more difficult, if you're particularly susceptible to boredom. The combat tuning, however, may make it an attractive game for younger audiences, or parents looking for a game to play with their youngsters.There were a few graphical glitches where objects you need to interact with appeared to be invisible. When I was using the game's photo mode during boss fights, their health bar still appeared. Some of this stuff will likely be fixed in a day one or post-launch patch, though. The performance is excellent on Xbox Series X, although I did experience a few crashes during my time with the game.While the battles against the Worldeaters are fun and varied, the road to get to those fights can be punishingly dull. Most of the quests are repetitive, the narrator robbed me of investment into the characters, and the combat systems need some serious work. Even though this game offers hours of content with some fleeting gameplay satisfaction and impressive art and design, too much of Biomutant is hollow filler that gets tedious quite quickly.Overall, Biomutant is an okay game with potential, if the developers address future feedback. However, I would only recommend this game if it's on sale since the $60 price tag does not reflect the game's quality as of writing. With subsequent updates, that could change, and hopefully, it will. But as of right now, Biomutant does not live up to the hype.Unite the tribesBiomutant has potential but it needs to iron its combat system and the story needs to show us the characters' personalities, rather than tell us about them.Alexander Cope is a gaming veteran of 30-plus years, primarily covering PC and Xbox games here on Windows Central.

Biomutant,Allen Kesinger,COGconnected,https://cogconnected.com/review/biomutant-ps5-review/,"Biomutant, developed by Experiment 101, is a story of survival and renewal in a world populated by mutated, anthropomorphized animals. An open-world action RPG played to the tune of Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, you’ll take control of a vengeful fuzzy warrior who comes face to face with a new, apocalyptic threat.The world of Biomutant is built atop the remains of an Earth-like civilization that died out because of pollution. The outrageous negligence of the Toxonal Corporation caused an ecological cataclysm that poisoned the soil, ruined oceans, and kickstarted hyper-accelerated mutations among animals. The mutated creatures eventually took over and created their own society of six tribes that live in harmony and guard the Tree of Life, a giant tree with large, life-giving roots. However, the appearance of large beasts called Worldeaters threatens another disaster. The tribes have fractured in the face of this danger. Half of them believe they need to unite against the monsters. The others would rather conquer and consolidate power. Running alongside this end-of-the-world narrative is the player’s revenge quest against an old foe. For the hero, the adventure represents an opportunity to reflect on revenge and forgiveness and maybe save the world while doing so. The biggest sin of this open-world experience is just how incredibly dull it is getting around and exploring. The map is large and too often do primary and secondary quest chains get spread out across all four corners of a world. There is a lot of wasted real estate. I expected to find things to do out in the wild, like fishing, getting into races, and going on treasure hunts. Instead, there is barely anything to hold my attention during long walks toward mission objectives. There are ruins stretched few and far between that hold loot. You’ll also come across enemy mobs itching for battle though you are under no obligation to fight them. Too much of Biomutant is spent pushing the analog stick forward until you reach your destination and in most cases, that can take an unnaturally long time. The most ridiculous experience I had involved encounters with hazard zones. These zones suffer from poison clouds, extreme temperatures, and a lack of oxygen that require different protective suits to survive. An hour or so in the game, I had spent too much time running towards an objective only to stop and suggested I hike to another faraway location to find hazard gear. Why not make these errands part of the main quests? You can’t advance the game without them, so what’s the point in stashing them so far away if not to artificially pad length? Keeping you company is video gaming’s most insulting narrator. Bastion and The Stanley Parable this ain’t: Biomutant’s narrator is a disembodied voice that doesn’t know when to shut up. He tries to be funny and often waxes philosophically with non-contextual aphorisms. The worst offense, though, is that he engages the player using baby talk that sounds rude and insulting. After about five hours of play, a tooltip popped up and told me how to adjust the frequency of the narrator’s lines. Sadly, setting it to “0” doesn’t cut him off completely. Developing your mutant warrior is possible through a standard levelling experience typical of mainstream RPGs. Character creation involves allocating points to base stats and selecting a combat class. These classes offer bonus stats befitting their combat styles. Gaining levels rewards more points to spend on upgrades to attributes, abilities, and unlocking special combat moves. Another element of character management is a karma/morality system. Morality plays a major role in the story and you’ll make decisions throughout the game that pushes the needle back and forth. Most of these choices, however, feel superficial and don’t have a meaningful impact beyond setting up the endgame. Biomutant’s combat involves stringing together range and melee attacks to form combos and trigger special abilities. A generous move list offers plenty of options to play with and encourage experimentation. Combat has some nice variety but overall, the practice of swinging weapons around isn’t noteworthy. Other games have done better at making you feel cool swinging big swords and blasting away with guns. Part of this has to do with how slow combat feels, even with one handed weapons. No matter how many points I put towards agility, enemies always seem to be far more faster and agile. Instead of scrounging or buying new weapons, you’ll find scrap parts to build your own one- and two-handed implements. Biomutant makes it fun to attach hammers, blades, and blunt objects to pipes, bats, and other makeshift handles. You can also add mods using repurposed junk to add elemental effects like fire and shock. The mix-and-match nature of the crafting system is fun and allows for creativity. It would have been nice, though, to make cosmetic changes. You can’t craft armor but there are lots of leggings, shoulder pads, and chest pieces to give your fur fighter a distinct look.For a PlayStation 5 game, Biomutant isn’t going to blow you away with visuals. Originally released for last-generation consoles, it wasn’t a visual powerhouse to begin with. The PS5 version lets you switch between performance modes that increase the resolution at the expense of framerate. Others ignore visual fidelity for a much smoother performance. The environments do look nice, whichever option you choose. The sun and moonlight reflect off grassy hills and great draw distance provides glimpses of pretty landscapes. Some interiors, however, look held together by spit and bubblegum. Textures tear regularly and in close, confined spaces, the camera has trouble following the action. Biomutant has ambition but at the end of the day, it just isn’t all that fun. Experiment 101 put together a strange chimera of ideas in their game that never quite connects in meaningful ways. Finding fun was hard because the story isn’t great, exploration is a chore, and combat is serviceable. I did like the puzzle-like nature of the Worldeater boss fights because they break the monotony of quests. Technologically speaking, the game looks and performs well enough. However, I encountered a few bugs that required dying or hopping to the title screen to fix. All in all, Biomutant had the potential to be a frolicking Zelda-like but everything about this ecologically-minded adventure falls short of its ambition. ***PS5 Code provided by the publisher***Developer: Experiment 101Publisher: THQ Nordic"
Biomutant,John-Paul Jones,PlayStation Universe,https://www.psu.com/reviews/biomutant-review-ps5/," John-Paul Jones / September 7, 2022Biomutant PS5 review. When we reviewed Biomutant all the way back in May 2021 last year (which honestly just seems like eons ago now), it was clear that developer Experiment 101 had turned in a charming and accessible open-world RPG that would appeal to PlayStation gamers both young and old. Despite the broadly evident calibre of Biomutant it was also equally clear that last year’s game wasn’t quite as polished as we perhaps would have liked, with frequent crashes, an array of bugs and less than ideal technical performance blighting what was otherwise observed to be one of the hits of the year.Now taking a second bite at the apple with an apparently all-singing, all-dancing PS5 edition of the game, Biomutant has re-emerged with a range of improvements that aim to shore up many of the surface flaws that were evident when the game released on PS4 last year. Unsurprisingly, the single biggest leap that the PS5 version of Biomutant brings over the last-gen edition of the game is a sizable uptick in technical performance.As you might expect this manifests itself in three different visual presets that the player can choose from. Equally expectedly, these presets fall into the categories that have been pretty much established since the start of this current console generation. This means players get a choice of a fidelity mode that has native 4K visuals locked in at 30 frames per second, performance mode which locks in 60 frames per second at 1440p resolution and then finally, a ‘quality unleashed mode’ which promises 40 to 60 frames per second at dynamic 4K resolution.Additionally, if you’re lucky enough to own a HDMI 2.1 compatible display and have the good sense to have that ‘allow VRR for unsupported games’ toggle activated in your PS5 display settings menu, you end up getting the best of both worlds with the quality unleashed mode, as not only does Biomutant push hard for that 4K resolution but the framerate is much smoother and much more stable too. Official VRR support for Biomutant is set to be confirmed via an update that will be released soon.Given the unstable framerate of Biomutant when running on PS4 and PS4 Pro, I can happily report that playing Biomutant at a rock solid 60 frames per second is an absolute game changer in every sense. Though the exploration and traversal that is so prevalent throughout Biomutant feels so much more satisfying now on PS5, it’s really the combat side of things that benefits the most, as encounters are now played out with the sort of liquid smoothness and ultra-responsive controls that just weren’t able to be accommodated by Biomutant when running on PS4 and PS4 Pro hardware.Further Reading – All PS4 Games That Have Free PS5 Upgrades In 2022 – Next Gen Upgrades At No Extra CostThe improvements that the PS5 version of Biomutant bring also extend beyond the visuals, with adaptive trigger and haptic feedback support adding a layer of palpable immersion to the proceedings that just wasn’t there before, as the rattle of guns being fired, swords slashing through the air and leaping from one surface to the next are all conveyed through the DualSense controller with due aplomb. Though you could well argue that both the haptic feedback and adaptive trigger technology that defines the DualSense controller is starting to a feel a little shop-worn thanks to a varying degree of successful implementations, it still feels *just right* in the context of Biomutant and arguably enhances the experience – albeit incrementally.A nice little feature that Biomutant also boasts is cross-save support with the PS4 version of the game, meaning that you can pick up right where you left off as soon as you update to the PS5 version of Biomutant, a fact that it is sweetened further still by the fact that upgrading to the PS5 version of Biomutant is free to anyone who owns the PS4 version of the game.As to the game itself, Biomutant remains structurally unchanged from its previous PS4 release. An open-world adventure that beautifully combines a hybrid melee and ranged combat system with a far Eastern influenced setting that is itself blended into a unique take on the post-apocalyptic yarn, Biomutant certainly provides one of the fresher takes on that well-worn setting in quite sometime.Further Reading – Biomutant Review (PS4) – A Highly-Anticipated, Brand New IP That Delivers On It’s Long Awaited Premise And PromisesIn particular, the leveraging of an in-depth character creation suite which not only allows players to embrace a breathtaking degree of creative latitude to adjust the cosmetics of the central protagonist, while a range of class, stat and mutation types allow players to minutely tune their post-apocalyptic furry hero/villain almost infinitely. It’s great stuff that legitimately makes you feel like Biomutant’s main protagonist is every bit your own creation. In regards to the mutations side of things, Biomutant allows players to tailor their chosen yet further still, meaningfully augmenting them with a fresh set of abilities, resistances and more besides.Despite all of that, I can’t say that I necessarily enjoyed Biomutant quite as much as our previous reviewer. Primarily, while Biomutant is a perfectly competent and unusually charming open world effort, there are still a number of baked-in flaws that haven’t been (and I suppose were never intended to be) addressed by this PS5 release.While the exploration that Biomutant boasts is perfectly enjoyable and certainly rewards the player for undertaking it frequently, the combat is something of a let down. Though nobody was expecting God of War levels of complexity and polish, using either blade or firearms in any of Biomutant’s many violent encounters simply feels flat on account of oddly muted sound effects where attacks just don’t sound like they land at all, while occasionally disjointed animation where our furry protagonist can jerkily shift from one series of attacks to another further highlights the need for additional polish here. Certainly, it’s not terrible at all and will certainly still appeal to younger folks nonetheless, but older gamers who have long been weened on the likes of Ghost of Tsushima, Horizon Forbidden West and others, will likely find themselves less than impressed.Further Reading – PS5 Enhanced Games List – Every PS4, PS5 Game With Enhanced Graphics Modes In 2022Elsewhere, the non-linear design that Biomutant seemingly prides itself on is based entirely on a very on-the-nose morality meter that is quite literally manifested into physical existence by a light and dark imp that chastises/cheers you on depending on which choices you make, which are also in turn largely binary in terms of the agency that is made available to the player. Again, while this feels perfectly fine for younger players, PlayStation gamers of a certain vintage will quite likely find this system a touch too simplistic.Despite these flaws, Biomutant nonetheless cements its place as a broadly entertaining open-world action RPG thanks to its commendably unique setting, surprisingly in-depth multi-class creation system and relaxing explorative beats that help to separate it from other open-world offerings. Certainly representing the definitive version of the flawed but still ultimately enjoyable Biomutant on PlayStation consoles, Biomutant’s PS5 debut largely erases the performance issues and instability that plagued the PS4 version of the game, delivering a handsomely made open-world adventure that can be enjoyed by gamers of all ages.Biomutant is out now on PS4 and PS5.

Biomutant,Andrew Farrell,PC Invasion,https://www.pcinvasion.com/biomutant-review/,"The amount of money it must take to create a large, beautiful world with high-quality assets is nothing to sneeze at. Not just the investment, but the required amount of work is simply enormous. This is why I always find it strange when games containing said worlds half-ass everything else. Aside from its questionable use of fog to obfuscate distant views, Biomutant is gorgeous. The lush, vibrant foliage, the sweeping plains, the streams and hills, they’re all lovely. But everything else is purely mediocre at best. It’d be a stretch to call the game awful, but it’s so middling (or worse) in every non-visual aspect that it’s hard to paint it as anything less than a glaring missed opportunity.The worst thing about Biomutant by a mile is its narrative, though. You create a furry critter who lives on a post-apocalyptic Earth that has been polluted to death by an evil corporation named Toxanol. The game thinks it makes a powerful statement by repeatedly mentioning how bad pollution is and, well, no shit. We don’t learn anything about the company or how things got that bad, but they were evil and they killed humanity somehow. Earth is now occupied by mutated animal people instead of humans. Your main character was raised by their mother, a master in the underexplained martial art known as Wung-Fu. However, the village was attacked by an underdeveloped villain named Lupa-lupin, who killed the protagonist’s parents. The game is barely about that, though. Instead, the Tree of Life is threatened by four kinds of weak monsters called World Eaters, and you need to kill them all. Why is there a Tree of Life? Where did it come from? Who knows, but the World Eaters are destroying it or something, and the Earth will die if they’re not stopped. Finally, there’s an ark you’re meant to populate to safely leave the planet in case it’s destroyed. In case you’re confused, yes, Biomutant immediately concerns itself with three separate narrative threads and does absolutely nothing to tie them together in a satisfactory way.It goes without saying that the narrative itself is a mess. It’s built out of trite clichés with no depth or anything of interest whatsoever. The animal people speak in gibberish and, instead of just subtitling the gibberish, every line of dialogue is translated by Biomutant‘s endlessly annoying narrator who never shuts up. Story sections are tedious, boring exercises in gibberish followed by badly written exposition delivered by the narrator. He doesn’t do a bad job, to be frank, but the writing is grating.To put it bluntly, I’m very tolerant of bad stories and awkward dialogue. The Room is one of my favorite movies. Before Biomutant, I had never played a game where I felt the burning desire to move past most of the dialogue as quickly as possible, but I did here. I was actively unhappy during these sequences and needed them to be over as soon as possible. They’re torturously boring. It doesn’t help that the game has such a simplistic, basic outlook that absolutely doesn’t require as much talking as it has.There are no interesting characters. There’s just pretentious, long-winded rambling from characters that almost exclusively send you on bland, forgettable fetch quests. No one is actually important or memorable. It doesn’t help that Biomutant has the very best morality system that 2002 had to offer. You can either choose the goody-goody response, or you can be an evil dick. Literal black and white creatures show up and have generic, annoying angel-and-demon conversations with each other when you make choices, which lead to you having a light or dark aura. Having one or the other dictates a short cutscene at the end of the game and which useless powers you have access to.Biomutant‘s game structure is almost offensively simple. There are four World Eaters. You need to kill them. The game’s hideous, boring main quest giver is called Out-of-Date, and he sends you to assist four of his associates to take down each World Eater. All of them have access to a machine or creature they can outfit to fight each monster, but they need a few fetch quests handled before it’s ready. For whatever reason, they are all incapable of handling any of this themselves and are happy to risk the future of the world while they wait for you to show up and kill the monster. Most of the boss battles suck, though. The damage balance is off on some, they drag on too long, and they’re dull as hell.Pretty much all of Biomutant‘s story quests are tied to fighting them. The story is insanely short and can be brute-forced in just a few hours if you ignore the game’s tedious, pointless side content. The world is large and you can explore to your heart’s content. The lone non-visual compliment I can give the game is that navigation is competent, and I didn’t dislike it. There’s a loot system at play here, but 90% of what you find is always garbage and the game is so simple that you probably won’t want to bother much with crafting or upgrading to begin with.Side quests almost all boil down to, “go and do a similar puzzle to activate an old appliance.” For instance, there are five washing machines, five projectors, five microwaves, etc. to find. Icons show where they are on the map and you’re meant to go to them and solve eye-rollingly simple puzzles where you match two colors. Your reward is an item you’ll probably never use. I put over 20 hours into Biomutant and practically every sidequest was a meaningless waste of time.Much of this would be somewhat excusable if the combat was fun, but it’s as basic as possible. You can choose from one of several weapon types, but you’ll mostly just run up to foes and mash the attack button until they die. Enemies have a warning appear over their head when they’re about to attack, which you can use to parry and then do a lot of damage. But the combat is mindless, even if it is functional. You have melee weapons and guns, but there’s just nothing to either. You hit or shoot things until their health bar empties. Neither feels particularly impactful either. Guns feel like they do nothing, and melee attacks feel unresponsive and disconnected. Biomutant sort of feels like Batman Arkham combat, but slower and not satisfying.You have access to two suites of abilities that you purchase with different currencies, but the abilities are, much like nearly everything else you obtain in Biomutant, mostly useless. You bind the abilities and use them in combat, but almost none of them are any better than just wailing on foes. One does let you turn foes against each other, which is handy when the game throws a whole mob of them at you at once, which it does often. I did the light path and unlocked the ultimate attack, which is a lightning blast that does decent damage. But I barely used it and just kept hitting things because it simply wasn’t all that effective or fun. You can also buy Wung-Fu attacks that you can add as specials to your combos. Unfortunately, there aren’t many of these, and a lot of them are not especially useful.Both melee and ranged weapons can be crafted, which I do recommend occasionally, because you’re able to make weapons that allow you to quickly beat most anything to death within a short timespan. I only needed to make three weapons over the course of the game. You’ll also get unique weapons from the six tribes. You can join one and then subjugate all the others. All tribes need to be united to beat the game. Once you’ve joined one and conquered two others, Biomutant then offers the chance to just unite the other tribes right away. If you play this game, I highly recommend you take the offer, as it vanishes forever if you refuse it, requiring you to do the other three tribes the hard way. They don’t take long, but, just like everything else, the objectives are boring and rehashed. I regretted turning down the offer almost immediately. Plus, most of the tribe weapons kind of suck, save for the bow.Once again, outside of the visuals, there is nothing good about Biomutant. It’s a boring, overly simple game that little kids might like, but I can’t think of a more insipid, uninspired open-world game. The narrative is abysmal, the combat lethargic, and the content is all weak and endlessly rehashed. The PC version’s optimization is also quite awful. Biomutant isn’t the worst game you’ll ever play, but it’s egregiously mediocre in almost every way, while occasionally unbearable in some others. I can only advise a hard pass.Offensively mediocre in multiple ways, Biomutant is a waste of resources. It's not terrible, but there's no excuse for it to be this vapid and underwhelming.About Us

Biomutant,Jaz Sagoo,COGconnected,https://cogconnected.com/review/biomutant-review/,"Originally announced in 2017, Biomutant instantly captured the hearts of gamers due to its incredible art direction that combined a rich post-apocalyptic world with bad-ass anthropomorphic animals. Boasting choice-driven storytelling, a martial-arts-based combat system, and a multitude of quirky forms of traversal, can this madcap collection of ideas fuse to create a truly remarkable experience?Set in the near future, after the extinction of humankind, Biomutant tells a wonderful tale that is laced with social commentary. After years of polluting the environment, nature and animals have had to adapt. Wildlife has become more adept, possessing human-like features in order to survive in a barren world littered with remnants of the past. A lynchpin to civilization, the Tree of Life has been contaminated. With its roots being devoured by the imposing World Eaters, it is your task to track them down and protect the sacred tree. Before setting foot on your perilous path, you get to tinker with a plethora of options to create the perfect cuddly creature for your road to redemption. This multilayered character creator allows you to drastically alter the protagonist’s appearance. Every tweak of each stat affects your furry friend’s physique and features, ensuring that your Biomutant is completely unique. With five distinct classes that come equipped with specific perks, players can build a character that best suits their playstyle whether it be ranged or melee-based combat.Bursting with life, Biomutant’s world has been lovingly crafted to communicate the origins of the universe. Secrets are burrowed within the ruined remains and juxtaposing meadows, rewarding exploration. Throughout, you will discover disposed items that can be crafted in numerous ways to create peculiar weapons and armor that affect attack or defense properties and your appearance. Relatively simple puzzles are nestled within abandoned gas stations and other uninhabited buildings. These commonly require you to maneuver objects, matching colors to unlock rare and legendary loot.Dotted throughout are the colonies of six tribes, each at war with one another due to their difference in opinion about preserving the Tree of Life. Your task is to reunite them but this can be achieved in a number of ways. Attack and crush the opposition so that your tribe can rule with an iron paw, or persuade neighboring factions to create an alliance. This dynamic approach to the narrative adds weight to every decision as the effects of these leave an imprint on the world. Each step is beautifully narrated adding to the fantastical nature of the game. As the animals have their own language, conversations are translated and lovingly told, making the gamer feel as if they snuggled up in bed whilst Peter Folk tells a heartwarming tale. Adding to the charm, sounds are accompanied by an onomatopoeic comic book graphic further embedding the storybook feel of the game.On your adventure, you will encounter strange and unique characters that will give you objectives to aid you in your task to annihilate the World Eaters. Missions follow a generic structure that primarily focuses on fetch quests, however, you are rewarded with an odd, mish-mash of items and eccentric forms of travel for your trouble. As if conjured in the wonderful mind of Maurice Sendak, bosses are adorable yet imposing. They prowl around arenas and strike ferociously, however, these battles are pretty much by the book and lack the originality of the character designs. Although the main campaign can be completed within 10 to 15 hours, scattered throughout are numerous side missions adding longevity to the game.Inspired by the Ratchet and Clank series, Biomutant gives you the tools to attack in a variety of ways. From a distance, you can use an array of weapons and magical powers to take down enemies. Specific powers can be earned and mapped to your face buttons, each of which is distinct and offers ways to vary combat and strategize. For example, you can spawn mushrooms that allow you to spring into the air and attack from above. When getting up close, evasion becomes vital. Timing your rolls will grant a slow-down giving you the opportunity to perform a vicious combo. Although there are a lot of options to destroy adversaries, each of which feels mediocre and lacks the nuances that its influences possess.Unfortunately, performance issues plague what could have been an unforgettable experience. Dips in the framerate regularly occur and the odd crash breaks the immersion. At times, you can also pass through mammoth enemies making encounters more frustrating than thrilling.Biomutant’s world is enthralling. The art direction and characterization will beckon players to scour the entirety of the map, discovering items that develop the lore of the universe. However, the gameplay is hindered by performance issues and bugs which make some parts of Biomutant feel like a chore. Although the game falls short of greatness, this ambitious debut from Experiment 101 has me salivating for their next release.*** Biomutant PS4 code provided by the publisher *** Developer: Experiment 101Publisher: THQ Nordic"
Biomutant,Liam Croft,Push Square,http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/biomutant,"GuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpBiomutant2021 5.7Game RatingUser Ratings: 14Our Review: Scroll DownKarate kidVersion Reviewed: PS5 (Backwards Compatibility) / EuropeanRepublished on Wednesday 30th November 2022: We're bringing this review back from the archives following the announcement of December's PlayStation Plus lineup. The original text follows.Biomutant could have released a decade ago and it wouldn't have looked out of place. By stimulating the open world formula of old with new takes on the RPG genre, studio Experiment 101 appeared to be living up to its name. The final product does indeed prove that a lot of trial and error was going on behind the scenes, but Biomutant is more misstep than anything else. Its original ideas fail to leave a mark in what is otherwise a very routine open world experience.It's the potential that kills you — this is very much a ""what could have been"" type deal. While many of its mechanics are rooted in mediocrity, it's clear Biomutant wanted to go big on RPG systems. You catch glimpses of that throughout the 20-hour or so adventure with speech checks that detract from your overall stats should you fail them and hard decisions which dictate who makes it to safety while others are left behind. The problem is they amount to very little, opting to be mere footnotes in a colourful but decidedly sparse landscape.And it is scant, for the world of Biomutant is often muted despite its bright shades and tones. The vast post-apocalyptic environment crafts itself out of rolling green hills and dilapidated buildings from a bygone era, divided across multiple regions each with its own climate and resistances. Except there's little to connect one landmark to the next. Long stretches of grass and rudimentary housing provide nothing in the way of captivating reasons to veer off the main path — neither does actual optional content as basic fetch quests litter our journal. Later biomes introduce a small slice of cosmetic variety, although their drawbacks are much the same.It all amounts to a pursuit for either chaos or tranquillity (the choice is yours) that manages to feel both basic and overwhelming. Simplistic in that modern open world design has it beat by a considerable margin, but also formidable outside of the action. The game is so overflowing with systems and mechanics that its menus are fit to burst.Balancing three different upgrade trees, a morality system, very in-depth crafting opportunities, various tribes to keep track of, and long lists of Wung-Fu moves, Biomutant threatens to topple under its own weight. There's simply too much going on — so much so that it's very easy to get lost within menus. Without comprehensively explaining what every option and mechanic has to offer, Biomutant feels like a reach for the stars that ran out of fuel before the ozone layer. Far too much feels like it either wasn't ready for lift-off or could have been approached in a better manner.What isn't quite as so overly ambitious is the combat itself, which can feel somewhat satisfying depending on the weapon you use. In what almost appears to be luck of the draw, some bats and big hitters will gratify when contact with an enemy is made while others lack any real oomph. Basic combos will see you subdue most combatants and customisable guns can deal damage at range — they always feel and sound like a pea shooter, however. What gives engagements some personality though is comic book-style text that pops off whenever a combo is successfully performed. Damage numbers then litter the screen to convey just how much of an impact you're having on an enemy's health bar. In tandem, they add a sense of style to proceedings. Nothing that will considerably elevate the combat system beyond mediocre, but at least they're something cool to look at.A long list of abilities then endeavours to expand the scope and capabilities of combat, except they never really amount to much. It's a snag that affects the entire game actually; enemies are too much of a bullet-sponge (or melee-sponge in this case?) and so powers feel largely inconsequential when they're having such little impact on a health bar. You'll need to really wail on foes before they meet their demise.Fuelling hostilities is the intricate crafting system, allowing you to customise every single piece of your get-up with add-ons. It's probably the most impressive aspect of Biomutant — developer Experiment 101 really went to town with the sheer breadth of possibilities on offer. You can arrange seemingly random household objects into a weapon of mass destruction, and then improve it with upgrades further down the line. If there's one thing the title nails, it's this. The results could be questionable when applied to combat, but what the system actually has to offer is mightily impressive. The number of weapon combinations you could come up with must be off the charts.Attempting to bring all these mechanics together is a flimsy story about the Tree of Life and the tribes which take refuge next to it. While it's all fairly uninteresting, the real kicker is the narrator. He's essentially the only voice you'll ever hear in the game, conveying what other characters are saying and their meaning instead of letting them speak for themselves. This strips them of any personality they might have. Their expressions fall flat, possible unique quirks lost, and mannerisms impossible to convey. The narrator takes away the possibility of forming a bond with another character as their chatter is absorbed and then spitballed back at you through the lens of a third party.What further trivialises any attempt at conversation is the dialogue options you have to choose from, the vast majority of which are presented as questions instead of statements. It's an odd design choice that robs you of many meaningful decisions, especially so when there's a morality system that likes to make itself known as often as possible. If anything, the two work against each other — why should you care whether the game considers you to be light, dark, or anywhere in between when interactions are mostly devoid of proper choice? Sure, it's abundantly obvious when one of these morality-affecting decisions appears, but the discussions in-between don’t seem to matter. Although, when there's maybe five to six NPCs populating an entire town and just one of them has anything even slightly noteworthy to say, it hardly feels like a system worth actively engaging in.Stopping the game short of complete condemnation is the frame rate, which is in a reasonable state following patches issued during the review process. A 60 frames-per-second mode is available on both PlayStation 5 via backwards compatibility and PS4 Pro, with the former console achieving that target for the most part. Quick stutters break the flow of combat and traversal on occasion, but they're few and far between. Except for fairly regular texture pop-in and glitchy light sources, it's pretty smooth sailing on the technical front. Just be sure to download and install all updates to make that happen.Biomutant could have been something special, but the ambitious project fails to capitalise on what it does differently. Trapped in the clutches of an open world from a generation past, its own ideas are thwarted by an overload of other mechanics and overwhelming menus. By trying to do so much, Biomutant skipped the part where it built a solid basis to work from. While there's still potential here, Experiment 101's first attempt hasn't realised it.Poor 4/10Scoring PolicyReview copy provided by THQ NordicPlease note that some external links on this page are affiliate links, which means if you click them and make a purchase we may receive a small percentage of the sale. Please read our FTC Disclosure for more information.About Liam CroftLiam grew up with a PlayStation controller in his hands and a love for Metal Gear Solid. Nowadays, he can be found playing the latest and greatest PS5 games as well as supporting Derby County. That last detail is his downfall.Comments (156)Noooooooooo Harsh, though not surprising to me unfortunately.It’s worse than we thought folksIncoming “reviews scores don’t matter when they don’t subscribe to my purchase decisions”Oh my word. That person in the other article deserves an apology, they were totally ripped into for suggesting that it might not be very good.THQNordic strikes again with another average at best title.So disappointing. I haven't played anywhere near as much as Liam has, but my impressions are just as bad, unfortunately. It just feels very unfinished and stretched far too thin — even in the early hours.It's such a shame, because it's clearly a unique concept and it has some really cool ideas. But the execution is totally off.I've been watching actual players play it and seems you barely scratched the surface, with people claiming these open up in the 40-50 hour mark. The map is also huge and I've watched people find tons of things off the beaten path and exploring seems worth it.I look forward to playing it.Doesn't surprise me this reviewed poorly! It did look VERY average on the videos i watched on Youtube. When it's free on Playstation Plus then i might give it a go lol@nessisonett no apology needed. As a matter of fact I just apologize to you guys for saying it would get a 60 Metacritic weeks ago. Seems I was being generous. 40’s & 50’s are more accurate@ShogunRok The team isn't a AAA team, they are less than 20 people.Think I'll still give it a shot but wait for a deep discount.Ouch. Reviews are all over the place on this, however. 8.5 on PSU. 8 on Destructoid. 6 on IGN/GameSpot. Currently a 71 average on Open Critic with 48 reviews. This is the lowest review by far.im about 13 hours in and loving itWhew, a decision well made to cancel my pre order. Good to know the real reason they nerfed resolution. Shoddy frame rate at the time of review copies going out.I'm disappointed, but with the lack of transparency and absurd review embargo it was clear this was another hype led disaster.@jmac1686 Then as the review suggests, perhaps the team shouldn't have overextended itself.I’m so disappointed! I was really looking forward to this. I can’t even cancel my pre-order now either.Ouch! Still looking forward to it myself.@awp69 74 ain’t half bad. I suppose that might still change though (going either way).Figured with the last minute embargo on reviews that this wasn’t going to be a well polished game, shame.This review and a few others have persuaded me to pass on it. A shame as it has the makings of something interesting; I'm just totally done with generic open-world game design at this point.Also as for the PS5 debacle: 1080p may be fine for some, but on my OLED the image is far too soft.@Voltan Reviews exploded over there. Still 71 with 63 reviews. Again this is one of, if not the lowest scores of them all.I’m still buying it. These are a bunch of 8s and 8.5s on Open Critic.Wow. That’s a bit of a shock. Been lookingForward to this for a while@2cents Metacritic is high 60’s so far. It mad more above 70 reviews than reviews like this. I haven’t read any, but I’m still skeptical of how much the game has been trashed here because of that. So far you’re more accurate.@Jaz007 I use Open Critic. It’s more accurate IMO. 71 there.@KundaliniRising333 The difference in resolution killed it for me. I don’t mind 1080p. But when the xsx version hits 4k I can see the priority level at pushing the xsx hardware. If you are going to visibly favour one system then no sale for me. I don’t want an xsx either. So it’s a loss for the company. Which is a shame because the lions share of console sales are playstation sales.@awp69 this is my first time hearing of open critic. And I’m by no means new to this stuff. Seems you’ve found an aggregate of scores that are more positive than anywhere else on the internet, bravo!@awp69 Is that more like gamerankings before or got absorbed by Metacritic? I hate metacritic for games compare to gamerankings. And how often I visit has shown that.I honestly didn't understand what the hype was about. It looked very average from screenshots, but I hadn't looked far into it so assumed I was missing something. Apparently notIm glad I didn’t buy this trash 🗑.Good review, but I wish you guys wouldn't review PS4 Games on a PS5. I'm not against a note in a PS4 review saying something like ""we found the frame rate improved when played on a PS5"", but I think a PS4 game should be reviewed on a PS4 or PS4 Pro. There are a LOT more PS4s out there than there are PS5s.@PapaGlitch It might be because of the studio behind it: a small, plucky band of developers gave it an underdog feel; I guess everyone wanted it to do well.From what I've read the team were afforded a rare luxury of a long dev time with little to no crunch, allowing them to take their time and create something special without publisher interference or pressure.The problem is that they chose to use this extra time to stuff it to the gills with unnecessary features to, I guess, stand up to its AAA contemporaries, and in doing so diluted the focus and ironically, made it just like many generic AAA open-world games, only far rougher.@2cents Oh yeah, that’s definitely why I got there. Not. It is different than Metacritic in that it summarizes scores across all platforms. This is helpful for smaller games especially because sometimes there may only be 5 reviews on one console and 4 or another, etc.It has plenty of negative scores. Anyway, you do you. I am on a lot of other sites that hate Metacritic and only use Open Critic.Just like I don’t use only once site to get my reviews from because I like more perspective. Positive or negative.Looks like a lot of readers here are taking this one review as gospel. Power to them.The game looked like it had potential but I can't say it needed more time in the oven since it's been there for years.Dang...been really looking forward to this as I have not had a new quality game to play for a long long time. Imma pass on this too. Even if it is a bit better than this review is saying, I still can't be bothered. I unfortunately only have time for amazing games...not merely good ones.4 of 10? Sounds a tad harsh, at least a 5 even from the review. Shame about the environment, though. A world full of life, NPCs and a balanced amount of enemies is really important to me. Horizon nailed that nearly perfectly, with maybe a few enemies too many in spots. Also, I dislike sponge enemies. That bit can be patched if it's a common complaint, but the overworld is probably stuck bland. Discount it is, I suppose. That's the 4th planned day one I've been disappointed by in about a year.That's a bummer. Always like a good underdog story when it comes to small dev teams.I spent 4 years hoping the gut feeling I had would be proven wrong.I gotta say, this kind of sucks to hear.@The_New_Butler @BionicDodo Unless it's an absolutely exceptional circumstance, our reviews will always be conducted on a PS5 unless the reviewer in question doesn't have access to one. You could say our reviews cater to those who do own a PS5 now and will do so in the future. How the game runs on the console is discussed.This is disheartening, but the results from other sources has also varied so maybe this can still appeal to me. Hopefully this also gets some long-term support in regards to patches and additional content too.My son likes the look of this so got the standard edition on disk. I can play it at some point after a few patches under its belt 🙂@jmac1686 I'm sorry, you have to play the game for at least 40 hours for it to get good? How is that acceptable?This couldve easily been an elex review. Honestly expected another poor open world by thq nordic. After the horrible elex I never bought any other game from them. Are those ps3 graphics?@KayOL77 I don't necc know if they favored one console or the other, rather than it was easier to do 4k with the hardware of one or the other, however if you aren't going to put in the time to equalize, it certainly hurts the sales potential and credibility.If it was an issue of woman/manpower, simply hire more and invest to a worthy extent that which you spent 4 years on.Reviews to me for the most part have always been irrelevant and this one is no different. I will decide what I think of the game myself and honestly it's about time Review Scores like this were scrapped altogether.Well that’s one to strike off the wishlist then!Thats a shame. Was hoping it would be a decent game but after delays and issues this felt inevitable unfortunatelyMan, this looked so cool! What a shame! Anyway, I really don’t wanna buy anymore PS4 games so this sort of helps me in that regard.@The_New_Butler I've only played the game on PS5. The review mentions that a 60 frames-per-second mode is available on PS4 Pro, but the criticism only covers PS5 as stated: ""with the former console achieving that target for the most part"".Oof, been watching gameplay over the weekend and something just seemed off about it. Sounds like a healthy effort for such a small team but seems like a perfect one to hold of until is 20 bucks. Thanks for the review!@The_New_Butler I don't understand, if its a poor game on the pro/ps5, why would you expect it better on the base ps4?If this site gives it a low review score, to me that means this game is unbelievable good. The reviewers here are barely gamers based on every review I've read here.Just remember folks, NEVER listen to reviews. Most game journos can't even play video games properly.@RubyCarbuncle that suits you fine, but i personally appreciate reviews and opinion. A world without them would eventually turn into an even greater influx of cyberpunks', and using customers as beta testers. Wthout some measure of accountability and incentive to make a game decent at launch, corrupt practice would flourish further, as it does on most consumer goods.@Bush ..man..elex..uggghh..@The_Pixel_King So you're letting somebody else decide for you instead of deciding what you think of the game yourself? ok then.@KundaliniRising333 We got by without them before and Reviews are never fact for the most part they're just a person's own personal opinion making them subjective but sure whatever you say.I'm beginning to dislike coming here like I did Nintendo Life. You lot do what you like I'll make my own decisions thanks.@KundaliniRising333 Everything you said is false. Without reviews of random people you don't know, the game industry would be completely fine. The fact companies use people as testers is because gamers have become more and more use to mediocrity. The 80's and 90's were just fine without 4000 reviews for a game.I have read a few reviews of this game, and even the positive ones point out a lot of the flaws noted here in the Pushsquare review. The reviews that gave the game a higher score just seem more willing to overlook them because they find the game generally fun.I am really looking forward to this game, and I am bummed about what appears to be some issues with the game. I am still going to try it some day, but maybe wait for a sale.@JB_Whiting Ah I see, I wasn't aware of the back story. That is a shame then.@Deadlyblack Maybe thats why (removes sunglasses) people got burnt out from it
OOOOOOOOOOOOOhBruh when I saw the review I was so happy but the second I saw the rating that smile was wiped out faster than you can say ""turbulence"".@itsfoz that was my first concern for it. Hearing that the characters don't really have any real character seems a waste of potential also! And unresponsive combat animations arent ideal for a kung-fu themed action game@nessisonett I mean you're right, but at the same time their evidence was a Conan review.@HotGoomba This is very true tbh.Wow, that is so disappointing to read. I was so psyched for this! I was expecting an average 7 at worst but never dreamed of it getting a 4!Doesn’t sound like it’s anything that can be resolved by future patches either unfortunately, apart from perhaps the bullet sponge enemies...I was almost going to purchase day one but I will definitely hold off now until maybe it comes down in price.Well this is worse than I thought it would be i was expecting a 6 ,with regards to the debate about do reviews matter,reviews have always mattered to a degree ,even in the 80s and 90s I use to buy crash and zzapp 64 magazines, and even then I wouldn't touch a 4 with a ***** stick.What a shame. Doesn't sound like a native ps5 version will change the score much either as its mostly down to the game design and mechanics.I agree with the comments that if it's a ps4 game it should be reviewed on that console for the most part at least.@KundaliniRising333 I agree. It maybe easier to get that result on one console. But that proves the other needs tlc. Especially as you’ll be selling more probably on that format. I know the ps5 has tremendous capabilities. It might not quite be at the level of xsx, but it’s not THAT big a difference. Not even 1800p? Not even checkerboard 4k? No thanks. Not good enough for my money.Hope you lot are ready to eat your hats after I posted last week that the reviews coming out for this game were not good.Wait for a sale, definitelyThank God I was able to cancel my preorder on PSN. I was really looking forward to this game. I guess I will wait until it goes on a deep sale and they fix a bunch of things. Welp, now I can preorder Ratchet & Clank. I know that game won't disappoint.@HotGoomba no, the evidence was opening our eyes and using common sense from years of playing and viewing games. Anybody who was paying attention could predict the pros & cons of this particular game, if the pros outweigh the cons in your opinion then power to ya.Doesn’t change the fact that paying attention to details can be your best betFact is video game reviews have been inflated these days, review codes are given out like Halloween candy, large & small publications get preferential treatment, streamers get early access to help their subscriber count - all these factors and more contribute to a higher than normal review score for countless modern games. So when a title like Biomutant does this poorly it’s extra representative of the lesser quality.You love to see itHow can anyone be surprised by this score!? There were massive red flags all over this@The_New_Butler Not gonna lie, I loved me some Cool Spot.That's too bad. I still might give it a whirl at some point but I'm still too much into Mass Effect again to try this out right now.@awp69 yep exactly this... it is NEVER a 4/10!Wow such a harsh score. To me, it's unjustified tbh. You guys turned into the next Gamespot, lmaoWooooow this is low!Anyway, I have it preordered and I'm sure I'll have fun with it...but maybe it's indeed a weak game!Crap! So few game releases lately, it would have been nice to be a well made one.
Now I guess it remains to be tried when it'll be offered as a Monthly free PS+ game.
Too bad, though, i was prepared to buy it day one if it was worth the price...When a developer releases a game like this and the scores are low and the sales will be low.How do they make any money and actually survive in the business, there have been a few like this recently and all that time and cost I don’t get how they are still around.Why are so many people taking this ONE review as if it’s the only one that exists. They’re are also 8s and 8.5s for the same game out there on the other end of the spectrum. Read more reviews. Or better yet, play it and make your own decision.@The_New_Butler gotcha, that makes sense.@awp69 why are you campaigning so hard for a mediocre product that you had no involvement in making? It’s not like THQ needs your cheerleading. Learn to let go! Clearly this game meant something to you and that’s fine, play and enjoy it. The rest of us who don’t will steer clear until we feel the price of admission (nearly free IMO) is met - this is gamepass fodder at best@RubyCarbuncle I think that is it, we just agree to disagree. I understand the subjectivity, but when reading multiple reviews, if you see common threads across them highlighting positive or negative aspects, then its a good way to understand what one is purchasing. As one whom works in science, i can tell you that this methodology is how the scientific process works as well. The subjectivity is set aside but the testing presenting a conclusion then leaving up for review is there to ensure a level of accuracy. that being said everything is subject to corruption, as much of our science has along with economic practices and obviously the ridiculous political system meant to divide, but that's a whole other problem. lolHowever i am curious, you say you hate reviews, and yet here you are posting in the comment section of a review. I wonder if it is more likely that you just don't like the conclusions of the reviews on this game, and thus wish to play devils advocate.This game caught my attention right from 1st trailer, and I was really looking forward to it.After reading this I'm not sure about it, and that disappoints me 😐@2cents exactly@2cents All I am saying is that this review is far on the negative side of the spectrum. And I always read more than one review. But if everyone here only reads one person’s opinion on the game, go for it. Carry on.My copy should arrive tomorrow...I wasn’t really sure what the game was about when I watched the trailers and after reading this review, I think I understand why.The only thing that really bothers me is the decision to use an narrator in place of giving the characters their own dialogue/personality.If I had known this beforehand I probably would have skipped this... but I’ll give it a chance and see how I get on.4/10 lol holy bombs BatmanSheesh@SamMR have you played it? How do you know it’s harsh?Hey guys it has a 98 on closedcritique.comPre-order opened!!@awp69 Don't focus on the number, focus on the details of the review.What I mean is for some people ""Short"" is a con, and for others ""Long"" is. Read the list of things that they called out as issues, if you think those are non-issues, or even things you would consider a pro rather than a con; then consider trying it for yourself. When I read that list, its just one nail in the coffin after another.4/10 yikes! Definitely a pass from me4/10!? Ouch!! Holy crap. That's really sad. Few things are as depressing as the feeling of ""could have been.""63% on MC, such a shame as it looked really promising. I'm still interested but i will wait until its like £15 or £20, i'm a sucker for open world games so i shell most likely get some fun from this.@fR_eeBritney I mean, it's probably not too late to return it.@Dezzy70 Short answer, a lot of the time they don't survive. Some game companies simply bankrupt themselves making a AAA level game with C-grade quality.All is not lost. This got a better score than Cyberpunk 2077!Was really looking forward to this game, didn't expect that score. Just watched Skill Ups review on YouTube who I find to be a good honest gamer, and he pretty well hated it. Just looks like they tried to add to much and by stretching themselves they forgot to get the basics right, especially the sound and combat.Damn.. an here I got it pre loaded lol@2cents ""why are you campaigning so hard for a mediocre product""Haven't you posted more than @awp69 in this thread, and against the game, and also have admitted to giving this game a 'bad' score prediction weeks before it released?Why have you campaigned so hard against the game?I had a feeling that this game would maybe fail to deliver. It looked interesting from day one but the world seemed empty and the combat seemed basic and repetitive. It looked like a last generation game (PS3 era). will probably still play it it when it drops in price.Bummed, but this gives me a reason to get Rift Apart at launch!@RubyCarbuncle When it’s £50 and I’ve got a lot more to buy and play, yeah that’s exactly what I’m doing. To be fair, I’d gone off it quite a bit after watching a couple gameplay videos anyway.The classic case of trying to touch what you can't reach.@The_New_Butler Sorry but no, see the problem you are having is you are comparing those games to todays games. The games back then were ground breaking for that era. Color reskinning enemy pixels was a simple way to add variety to enemies while saving space on a already tiny file restriction. And none of those games you mention you could beat in 2 hours back then.I was going to buy it, but after looking at videos of it, I noticed some issues with sound and hit feedback, and decided maybe I would wait for some patches and a sale.@Kidfried Exactly. Who didn't see the hyping up this site was doing of this game just to cut it down right before it launches? Becoming very predictable.@The_New_Butler Sure not all games are E.T., but still groundbreaking for that time none the less and most were on the same level, you are just nit picking to make a point. But gaming almost didn't survive? lmao, not sure what universe you have been living in, its been in a constant up rise. If you played Gauntlet then, you would know how far beyond that was to other games at that time, it had drop in or out co op. You can't seem to separate gaming generations anymore.@RubyCarbuncle reviews and opinions are important when there’s no demo to see for yourself what the gameplay is like.Biomutant isn’t like R-Type Final 2 is to me, where I didn’t care what others thought about it b/c I knew I was buying it anyway.I got it preordered for $3 through some price mistake on EA's launcher. It will have to work hard to disappoint me.for anyone who likes this game , theyre just adding more fuel to the fire by giving bad games a pass. that just gives devs an incentive to not even try anymore if people are gonna be so overly optimistic over blatant trash . the more people give bad games a pass , the less and less developers will try .@KundaliniRising333 Where did I say I hate Reviews? I didn't say I hate them so stop skewing my words please. I said I don't let others decide for me is what I'm saying and it gets on my nerves the way whenever a game receives a negative Review so many people let that one Review influence their decision on whether or not they'll purchase it.I come here to keep up with the latest gaming news but sometimes when I'm swamped with too much negativity like in the comments here it puts me off and 9 times out of 10 I say nothing to avoid unintentionally upsetting people. I left Nintendo Life for this reason I don't want to leave here for the same reason.Me wanted game before.
Me no longer want game.@nomither6 Yes, how dare people like a game other people don’t! It’s horrible!It’s almost like people have their own opinions. I don’t want to live in a place like that.@awp69 Yes , how dare people misread my comment and look for a strawman argument to misconstrue my point !It's almost like I never implied that people couldn't have their own opinions , and just stated my perspective of my opinion of bad games. I don't want to live in a place where people lack reasoning .@nomither6 How could this be misinterpreted? “ for anyone who likes this game , theyre just adding more fuel to the fire by giving bad games a pass.” You are literally saying people who like this game are giving “bad games a pass”. Isn’t a bad game subjective? Based on opinion? Whatever.Maybe OTHER people don’t feel that way. And you are ***** on their ability to have their own opinion.@awp69 and no where within that statement did I say people couldn't have their own opinions . You're only fooling yourself , but , ''whatever'' .@RubyCarbuncle I hear you, and I certainly don't want to contribute toward your view of negativity on this site. Wish you well.It will be interesting to see when it releases if the rumors bubbling up that it crashes horribly on ps5 are true.I'm starting to wonder if the PS5 was released with significant issues running software. The amount of games that have had to fix crashing, which prevail on PS5 more than all other platforms is concerning. Definitely a little bit of a letdown, considering this is the first time I have ever purchased a console at launch.lesson learned.I still plan to check it out. The reviews got it so wrong with Ghost of Tsushima and TLOU2@stefan771 Ghost of Tsushima was awesome, what did reviewers get wrong about it? TLOU2 doesn't interest me.@LiamCroft Thanks for taking the time to review it for us.Any reason why metacritic hasn’t included your review in the critic reviews yet?I will leave you all with two quotes laced with wisdom.""Stop frakkin' pre-ordering games."" -Me""If you buy a game at launch, you are paying the most amount of money for the worst version of a game."" -TotalBiscuit@KundaliniRising333 Thank you and the same to you.I guess not all games can be as good as Metal Gear Survive, right Liam. Lol! I swear you guys are terrible. Yes I have not played the game. But by all accounts it's an average game. In my world a game has to be almost completely broken to get a 4 not just be average. Considering how wrong you guys were about Oddworld and you disgustingly gave that a 4, I'm inclined to pick this up.@DeepSpace5D We are included for the PS4 version.@The_New_Butler I know the history but this crash was exaggerated and pretty much only affected the US console market (outside NA you barely felt it).The same story could be said about the early 90's when it got over saturated with consoles and games which then had the weak ones die off. There was like 10 different consoles around then too. After 80% of those failed only a few remained and gaming was better off for it. Its the same cycle, the only difference was arcades were already on the way out and PC's base was already established so the drop on the chart wasn't as noticeable.4/10? To me an four was a unplayable game, biomutant is really that bad?@Slippship yep and imo they are more in line with my feelings about the game. I have got the game on last thursday and am in for 15hours so far... the game is awesome to me. Like the last sentence of the PSU review is stating: ""If you're looking for something fresh, unique, and exciting, Biomutant is a brand new IP that you should play.""I don't care about scores. I never do.I wouldn't mind it on PS+ at some point.Reduced to £44 from £59 by Amazon uk already, on release day - word has spread. Watched a live feed of this last night - 10 minutes of a creature pretending to be Elvis in baby language - as you spoke to them, was like Telly Tubbies. At one point the streamer was so bored they were on their phone and didn’t notice the dialogue had ended. Such a shame, as was massively looking forward to this.At prices of €60+ all these kind of games need demo versions. I was looking forward to this game. But I am not risking that kind of money for a likely disappointment. I don’t have money growing on trees here 😥 give us demo versions to test before buying!RIP Biomutant  I had high hopes for this game...now I will wait for a $15 bargain bin sale or for it to come to Plus.Still don't understand how passionately people take review scores. As others have said, a review can only ever be one persons view. If you are interested as a consumer, read a mix of reviews to get a flavour of what the game is like and whether you think it will suit you.@Rudy_Manchego I think most of us do. The general impression is that most reviewers rate this game poor or mediocre. And of course that doesn’t mean the game experience will be like that for yourself. But, seeing the price tag I can’t buy a game just with the hope it might be good. Hope is often just delayed disappointment. 🤔@The_New_Butler @BionicDodo I've complained about this before, including the complete disregard for the PS4 version of Sackboy.
How does it play on the console it was written for, is a simple enough question to answer but so often seems to get ignored.There is definitely an air of 'we've got a PS5 and we're going to use it as much as possible' with some reviewers on this site, even when the game is designed for the PS4 and PS4 users want to know how it runs.The weird raccoon monster thing surely deserves more than a 4. The game might be rubbish but so what he's a rascal look at him.It's reviewing worse than my expectations. Such a shame. It looked like it had potential.I had an inkling it wouldn't be great when I wasn't seeing a bunch of early gameplay impressions. If you've got a new IP and have faith in the final product if think you'd want to get it in the hands of some people a couple of weeks early so they can put out gameplay footage aNd let potential customers know it's a product worth being interested in. I didn't see anything like that. I think they knew what they had.@ShogunRok One thing though minor bugs and glitches are a minus i dont see that on the triple A games though especially the Ubisoft ones.Still a pity it looked like fun.Hate to say it but this is pretty much what I expected from the trailers. Cool concept, so-so execution.Reminds me of Fable both in ambition and how polarizing it is. Only this game actually attempts to deliver on its grand ambitions instead of outright cutting most of them. I know a lot of people hate the Fable games but I loved all three. If any game gets me to buy an Xbox, it'll be the new one. So I'll still try this game.And I'm not saying that I'm going to love the game for sure and agree with PSU or AOTF before even playing it. It reads like a 6 or 7/10 to me but I'd also rate plenty of games I've had fun with the same, like most PS3 Ratchet games, Jak 2 and 3, Uncharted 1, The Order 1886, Dragon Age 2, Fable 3, Just Cause games, etc.@BadPlayerOne Agree completely - for me the review process is something that helps me to decide on a game or not. That doesn't mean I don't play games that aren't very highly rated but it sets my expectations correctly and how much I think I can afford to play the game. It just seems that people decide beforehand they like a game then get angry if the consensus isn't the same.@ORO_ERICIUS I’m having a blast with it too so far. It’s not going to win awards but I also am agreeing with the PSU review more on this one.@MattyHammo It got very mixed reviews. Several 5s, 6s and 7s when it is, IMO, a 9/10 gameI had a hunch this was going to be a bit meh despite having my pre-order for the Collector's Edition locked-in months ago. 4 days before release I decided to cancel as I had a feeling this wasn't what it initially looked to be. It looks like I made the correct decision and saved myself £100!@stefan771 Makes you wonder how reviews can differ so wildly? Sometimes I think it's what you expect of a game before you play it. Or is it because the game suffers somewhat on the PS5?My 2 very small cents, it's a new ip made by 20 people. You can shut the narrator off if he digs at you. Combat is what you make of it. Your either a exploring rpg person or not. That said I don't really use reviews for my purchases anymore as I have my tastes same as you have yours. However I do like to support a new ip if I think it can entertain me or give me more value back than a movie at a theater. Personally I chose to support the title and I'm very happy I did. Not everyone can spend 60 for a maybe title, heck most of you sound like you barely are eating...just giving my opinion and how my thoughts align..I played for a few hours last night. I’m really trying to like it. Sadly if I do play through to the end I think that’ll be the only time. Such a a shame, I was really looking forward to it.4/10 that's way to harsh on it .7/10 is more like it in my opinion.4 lol Oh Dear if it was that bad I wouldn't have gone past the intro screen .I'm enjoying the game!Didn't realise it reviewed this badly on original release date. Was expecting to see loads of 6 scores and the occasional 7. I wonder if any patches have made it better since then for the PS5 version or the game is just no good regardless of patches and updates?Great it's going to PS+. I don't understand the 'outdated world design'. I think the using animals as classes than just base stats before upgrading would have been nice. Getting an ability as a bat over a glider another could use, a water animal over a jetski so it's 'you get to do those first while the others have options still' would have been cool. Maybe for a sequel?No Mans Sky is the only other game with toxic environments to open up, sure you have towers in games to open up the map visibility (which I hate), sure the outposts, sure ok missions, a fine gear system. So to me while I haven't played many open worlds how is it outdated I don't understand? Even Sunset Overdrive was behind Spiderman in garbage and I preferred it as Spiderman was less fun with boring generic missions and barely besides 1 skill in the tree tree required for a mission. The weapons/icons and tower defence/movement based missions were great then being 10% of Spiderman.Sure it's AA but it's a fair game for a small studio and fair more interesting in world/dialogue approach with a narrator than most AAA snorefests copy and pasting and not enough mechanical ideas and just flare that reviewers give a pass to because it's shiny and big voice actors who cares.Breath of the Wild has weather that you can't do anything in and the Zora suit is useless, weapon damage is fine but compared to survival games Indies are further ahead of balancing durability systems. The Biomutant puzzles aren't Zelda puzzles but fine enough I think.Biomutant isn't the Darksiders 2 successor I thought it could be of a Hack n Slash RPG (no I don't count souls games) but still. Tell me a game that has hack n slash combos and varied weapon types/RPG elements combined with fast paced movement, I can't think of any as devs make souls clones right? In my opinion nothing else plays like Darksiders 2. Even God of War is just generic not what an evolution compared to the directions DMC or Bayonetta have gone in but no it's a generic action adventure skill tree experience with flare. Boring.A fair review/reason to bring it up again because of the PS+ announcement I assume but still was a game I haven't played much of but didn't hate at all I'm just not into open worlds usually anyway.@Beerheadgamer82 this was one of the worst scores. There were also 7s, 8s and even a couple of 9s. Metacriric / Opencritic had it at a fairer 64 / 67 with a matching user score of 6.7.There have been a few patches and the PS5 version sorted a lot of the performance issues.Some people enjoyed it, others didn’t, hence it’s a pretty good fit for PS+ and worth checking to see which camp you fall into. I’ll be doing the same in due course.@themightyant the ideal plus game then cause its no big deal if end up liking it or not and Mass Effect is a big win for Plus Essential regardless of already owning it Tap here to load 156 commentsLeave A CommentHold on there, you need to login to post a comment...32 Games Will Be Taken Off PS Plus Extra, Premium Next MonthSpider-Man, Resident Evil included16 Games Hit PS Plus Extra, Premium Next WeekBig April 2023 game refresh revealedPS Plus Extra Adds an Unexpected Bonus This Easter WeekendA link to the pastPoll: Are You Happy with Your PS Plus Extra, Premium Games for April 2023?It was all BethesdaSuikoden Remasters Release Date Could Be Incoming as Games Get RatedRPG classics could be coming soonGame ProfileTitle:BiomutantSystem:PlayStation 4Also Available For:PS5, Xbox OnePublisher:THQ NordicDeveloper:Experiment 101Genre:Action, RPGPlayers:1Release Date:PlayStation 4PlayStation Plus Essential (Subscription)Where to buy:Buy on Amazon

Biomutant,Rob Larkin,Gaming Nexus,https://www.gamingnexus.com/Article/7322/Biomutant/,"""Biomutant is an open world post-apocalyptic kung fu fable...in terms of structure it's like Zelda: Breath of the Wild...a strange, weird, good mix between Ratchet and Clank, Devil May Cry, Batman Arkham..."" Art and Creative Director Setfon Ljungqvist sets the bar high in the Explanation Trailer released last week and embedded below.There is so much to like about Biomutant. The game has been in development for years, announced with footage that has had fans anticipating this release since 2017. On so many of those fronts, it delivers. The first and best thing to dive into is the gameplay and combat. There are three distinct mechanics all rolled into one: kung fu...erm...wung-fu, gunplay, and magic casting or psi-powers. It all blends together into intricate dances against foes small and large. At times you will be confronted by a host of foot soldiers, at other moments face to face with a mini-boss, and sometimes even a mix of the two.The three combat styles compose a dance to flutter around the battlefield and mix in and out of ranged assaults, up-close-and-personal punches and slashes for better damage and furious combos, and simply navigating the horizontal and vertical space, often with the psi-powers. Everything is mapped well to the controller. You moves are aided by jumps, double jumps, and dodges, as well as the melee strikes, all mapped to the thumb buttons. Guns on the triggers. And psi-powers unleash with a combo of a shoulder and thumb button. It is easy to pull it all together, and the RPG elements of the game let you build up your own skills and new weapons. Abilities are slowly unlocked as you progress, giving you time to master the basics before putting the more complex together into the choreographed and rehearsed set of moves you will favorite. Now, early on, it did seem entirely possible to use cheap tactics to sleepwalk my way through all of these encounters. The first mini boss I went up against, I literally just strafed in a circle and fired my pistol until they fell. Ammo is unlimited. While reloads do happen, an occasional dodge roll away from any danger makes the strafe and fire tactic nearly unbeatable, even if it is a bit painstaking in how slow it chips away at the health bar.I'm not ashamed to admit that sitting back and relying on those guns like a crutch was a tactic I would employ often. The first encounters were a bit underwhelming as far as difficulty was concerned, but things did ramp up and, with it, my health bar often seemed to ramp down. So that ranged crutch was always a good way to keep the battle going while I figured things out with a new enemy, or just caught my breath when the numbers were against me.But I think the true credit to the game is, even pressed with a review deadline, that learning the other points of the triad was both easy and rewarding. That crutch was used less and less as time went on. Melee combat not only brings the risk/reward of both getting hit and doling out much greater damage, but the various weapon types and combos inherent to them unlock more and more enjoyment from each encounter. And psi-powers are there to to really shift the tides, or more importantly, shift the entire way the battle is approached by launching your character in the air, or closing distance to a ranged enemy in a blink.Unlimited ammo aside, it is balanced by a blue stamina meter that sprawls across the screen right under the green of your health. When it all comes together, the game really clicks. The following bit of PS5 gameplay is a great example of demonstrating the ballet that a skilled player can conjure in the combat loop.The next best thing to the combat mechanics is simply the sprawling world you get to practice them in. The world is rich, diverse, and hostile. There are enemies in pockets, locales to explore, NPCs to meet—some well off the beaten path. Even flora and fauna add to the atmosphere, even if they serve no purpose in the particular quest step you might be on. The world itself is the best storyteller, invoking a caution about mistreating the fragile earth we do inhabit and warning us about our fate is we don't respect her.The world of Biomutant has been raised from the remains of ours that came before, and some of those corners are still toxic to any who would dare cross the borders without environmental protection. However, pushing your limits to survive these challenges ends up being just another part of the mutation to adapt and overcome this harsh reality. There are elements of fantasy because, while the world is post-apocalyptic, it does dwell on the grit and realism of other series who share the timeline, but focus on the rebirth and aftermath of life finding a way. Life always finds a way.This is also a game that takes a stab at humor, and sometimes lands, if crass is down your alley. You unlock new fast travel points by, um, marking your territory (you pee on the signpost). There is also an extensive crafting and customization, both of which also reflect this humor.Focus your stat points on strength and your character's build automatically beefs up. Focus on intelligence and the head grows accordingly. Weapons and armor focus around that which was scavenged from the world before. So, that damage modifier might just be a pair of scissors strapped to your sword, which itself was made from a vacuum nozzle and a cricket bat. Most of this didn't actually land with me, but full marks for giving it a go, and there is a great depth in customization available. Where things start to go off the rails, however, is when you begin to focus on the main quest. I feel like much of my disappointment in the game really centers around a simple letdown. I entered the world of Biomutant with an expectation that the story simply failed to deliver. I literally wrote to our editor when the review opportunity came across my desk, ""I can make my own Rocket Raccoon!""That was my first reaction to simply viewing the game's cover art, something about the squirrelly little character with the eye-patch got me going. Then reading up on the game and discovering this promise of a king fu quest, I shifted gears from Rocket to Master Shifu from Kung Fu Panda. I even manipulated my starting stats in my character build just to best emulate Shifu's body-type and look. If I was going to go kung fu/wung fu, I was going all in. But I was all in on a tale that would never really deliver. There is an attempt to make the story ingrained in path of the character, but it constantly feels forced. For no apparent reason you begin the game with no memory of your past, and rather than revealing it like a slow burn it just gets laid out before you fairly early—but done so in such a start/stop way as to be frustrating. You quickly choose to ally with one of the six existing tribes and then are sent back to your home village for a flashback fiesta. Every three steps is another cutscene and lengthy flashback with a new NPC. You're being harried along to meet your mother the whole time, chided for taking so long to get to the end, and three steps later pulled into another exposition with no option but to follow. It plays out without even internal consistency. There are three main plot lines that don't so much weave in and out, as much as they just start and stop at random intersections. You have to ally with a tribe and defeat all others, fight a big bad that hounds you from the tutorial, and save the World Tree which is slowly being attacked at its four roots by four giant monsters. The main quest giver of the overarching narrative instructs you to end a tribal war, then criticizes you for spending so much time on a tribe war while the fate of the world is at stake. Well then quit telling me to go on tribe quests if you're so concerned about this World Tree. Sheesh, buddy.Dialogue trees branch but don't matter. Whatever choice I made seemed to elicited the same response. The game was very good at introducing combat concepts but in another early mission required me to chase after and catch an object on the run, but never actually explained what the catch button was. It was frustrating, to say the least. Especially for a game that initially seemed so very good at bringing in gameplay elements, until it isn’t.Other times I kept missing quick time events because I was meant to hold a button, not mash it repeatedly, even though in an earlier interaction with practically the same on screen indicators it was a mash button event. Then there are side quests that aren't very clear either. I spent a good bit of time chasing down loot boxes for my mech exoskeleton assuming it would function like scrap or eventually upgrade my rig, only to later discover it was all useless cosmetics. The worst bit was the simple repetitiveness of the plot. There are four monsters gnawing on four roots of the world tree, and every encounter plays out just about exactly the same: meet this person, go find this vehicle or mount, go meet this other person, go use a butterfly net to catch five of this random creature that is inexplicably going to upgrade the vehicle, go slay monster and hope you don't get pooped out their anus (that's literally how I died on my first attempt at the first monster). The only variation is the fourth and final monster, which adds an extra mindless fetch quest loop to the mix, so now you have two before your vehicle is upgraded instead of just one.I experienced a few bugs as well, many of them crashing the game. But I was on early builds and there were frequent patches incoming, so I'm not too worried about most of them, except when I would whittle a mini-bosses health down halfway or so and then the battle would take me just out of their range and they would promptly disengage from combat, run back to their starting position, and zap right back to full health... Grumble grumble. I think that will all get fixed, probably. What probably won't get fixed is just how simplistic the puzzle challenges are. Throughout the world, and in certain dungeon type settings, you run into these little puzzles that mostly boil down to ""line up the white lines and line up the yellow lines by rotating knobs."" Honestly though, I question why these were even included. There is zero difficulty and the only guardrail is that you only get so many rotations based on your intellect stats. It's idiotic and annoying just how bad these puzzles sequences are. Bad, but not necessarily ugly. For that...The game dialogue is terrible. Like, the worst I've ever played type of bad. No, check that, I played Dropsy the Clown. This is the second worst. It's not just that the dialogue is long and drawn out. It's not just that the choices I make in these long, drawn out trees don't seem to matter. It's not just that the dialogue is filled with overly cutesy jargon in these meaningless choices of long, drawn out dialogue trees. It's not just that the whole dialogue is performed in nonsense babble and only translated by a narrator's voiceover filled with overly cutesy jargon in these meaningless choices of long, drawn out dialogue trees. What really grinded my gears was the simple fact that on top of all this, the babble was presented nearly in its entirely and had to be skipped separately from the voiceover. So you have to mash the skip button at least once in between every single dialogue interaction just to get past meaningless babble and into the narrator's voiceover translation of overly cutesy jargon in meaningless choices of long, drawn out dialogue trees. And it goes around in circles, too. Halfway through the game we get to face up with the big bad. But even after defeating him, the dialogue trees for meeting him and deciding his fate remain tied to the characters encountered in the future, same as if it were the past. Every NPC wants to force you through conversation even when they have nothing relevant to offer. Everyone you meet has an opinion of everything, and you have to listen to all of it before getting to the quest. It got so bad there is an endgame mechanic where you are supposed to chose your favorite characters for the ending but I got to the point I left seats at the table blank simply because I was tired of engaging in any more dialogue to even recruit them. There are so many things to love about Biomutant: the combat is exceptional, the world is breathtaking, and there are customizations and crafting galore. What the game lacks is the glue to tie it all together with a compelling narrative. As such, it feels almost like something less than the sum of its parts. I had an expectation that I was walking into Kung Fu Panda, but because of the inane dialogue and storytelling choices I ended up instead in a bad Compare the Meerkats commercial narrated by a low-rent Stephen Fry channeling their best Little Big Planet impersonation. And it wasn't just the cover art that deceived me. The opening tutorial is centered around the cinematic trailer below. It blasts onto the stage with a mighty roar and great visuals and incredible emotion, then whimpers along from there, never even coming close to attempting anything so grandiose, even down to its finale. That is the true missed opportunity of Biomutant. It's not that the narrative itself is so bad—the quests themselves are repetitive, but a few minor changes and the story would be fine. It's that the delivery, locked behind only having to pay a single voice actor and never building any rapport with any of the characters, made me not only not care, but annoyed at every word. The painstakingly skippable gibberish underneath the voiceover made moving the plot forward downright tedious. Occasionally this game can be incredible. I can't forget one such moment, a musical crescendo accentuating shapes shifting at my feet, formed by shadows of moonlight as that celestial body peeked past desert mesas and shone in the horizon before me. It was a gorgeous, unscripted moment that brings to life this wonderfully crafted world, only to be let down by the speaking parts of every character within it. The Yin and Yang of Biomutant I suppose. A game that, if you let yourself simply get lost, you can discover a gameplay and exploration loop imminently rewarding. But if you choose instead to follow the path laid before you by the light of the shiny objective markers dotting the map, then its one that ultimately disappoints. In the end the final verdict has to reflect this Yin and Yang, the fantastic gameplay and the frustrating story. I'm going to settle on simply marking this game as Good. One that could have been class leading missed the mark in one major way, but still holds a grip on redemption because of the way the open world, or even New Game+, can become a sandbox to instead forge a better path.Biomutant attempts to channel many inspirations into a compelling package. It does much of that extremely well, excelling at world building and creating a fluid combat system to drive the experience. The one area it falls short is in tying it all together with an engrossing narrative. It not only fails at the narrative, but even worse, fails at the very mechanics of delivering the story. Wander the world on your own initiative and experience a great game; follow the path of the main quest and suffer the letdown of a mediocre tale, told poorly.* The product in this article was sent to us by the developer/company. First picked up a game controller when my mother bought an Atari 2600 for my brother and I one fateful Christmas.   Now I'm a Software Developer in my day job who is happy to be a part of the Gaming Nexus team so I can have at least a flimsy excuse for my wife as to why I need to get those 15 more minutes of game time in...

Biomutant,Francesco De Meo,Wccftech,https://wccftech.com/review/biomutant-disposable-heroes/,"The way humanity is abusing the planet and depleting its resources, there is no doubt that we are headed towards destruction. But if the post-apocalyptic world is as colorful as the one depicted in Biomutant, maybe things will not end up being so bad.  Only if we can forget the giant mutated beasts threatening the Tree of Life and bringing the world to the true, ultimate end, that is.In many ways, the whole Biomutant experience is exactly like the world where the adventure takes place. Everything looks nice and shiny on the outside, but a deeper look reveals how, in reality, things are not as good as they may seem. It a real shame, considering the potential the game had.As already mentioned, Biomutant is set in a post-apocalyptic world. The Tree of Life, which has sustained all life on the planet, is threatened by the fearsome World Eaters, giant monsters that have been unleashed by an ecological disaster brought forth by the Toxanol corporation. Like every evil corporation worthy of its status, Toxanol had no regard for nature and the environment, literally bringing the planet one step closer to destruction for mere profit. The ecological upheaval has shaken the world as a whole, with many areas becoming inhabitable due to some terrible hazards, while others got abandoned and now lie in ruin.It's in this ravaged world that the story of our fully customizable protagonist begins. Having lived a terrible tragedy that destroyed his home and tore apart his family, this lone hero sets out in the world to seek vengeance against the terrible Lupa-Lupin, who caused all the misery he had to live, not knowing that he will get involved in a fight to save the world from ultimate destruction, shaping it and what remains of society with his actions in the process.Biomutant's premise isn't particularly original, but the unique character and world design, which makes it feel like a computer-animated movie, help it stand out from the competition. The story itself is kind of hit and miss, as characters do not receive any outstanding development, but the unique storytelling approach does somewhat help in this regard as well. Everything happening on screen, from the simple passing of day to dialogues and events, is narrated, making the atmosphere feel quite peculiar, although the narration and the gibberish acted dialogues do get a little grating over time. The tone of the narration is mostly witty and somewhat humorous, with a character in his later years named Out-Of-Date and the remains of a church called Hopehall creating creates a very peculiar dichotomy that works well most of the time.Just like the story, even the Biomutant gameplay is hit-and-miss. There isn't anything inherently bad about it, no doubt, but some design choices can make it less enjoyable for some, depending on how much they can tolerate certain quirks.As mentioned above, the main character in Biomutant can be fully customized before the adventure even begins. The character creator offers a wealth of options, allowing players to pick the character's breed, which scales certain stats, class, resistances, and main colors. Classes influence the character's starting equipment and abilities, and they do lock the character into a certain upgrade path, as it is possible to level up any stat freely, equip any weapon if the level requirement is met, use any ability and learn any perk. It mostly provides a blueprint for developing the character, making it easier to create a balanced character that can be fully viable for the entirety of the game for those who are not well versed in role-playing games.Once you have created your hero, you are thrown into a linear area that teaches you the movement and combat basics. And it's here that the game's biggest issue comes to light: the combat system is not exactly good. Biomutant's action combat system is not too different from that seen in recent open-world RPGs like Assassin's Creed Valhalla and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, with players controlling their character and switching on the fly between different targets as they unleash regular attacks, ranged attacks, and special abilities, use items and parry enemy attacks with a well-timed button press.The main issue here is not the lack of innovation but how combat actually feels. Controlling the main character feels terribly sluggish, and the complete absence of a lock-on system forces the player to constantly move the camera around to have a good view of the combat area. This system does sound good on paper, as it lets players switch between melee and ranged combat on the fly depending on the situation, but it works terribly in reality, as the player rarely has a good view of the combat area, resulting in enemies attacking and damaging the player without being able to do anything about it. The automatic targeting system is so bad that, sometimes, you will end up attacking a faraway enemy with your Wung-Fu abilities, which leads to a ton of frustration. Making matters worse are enemies that attack from off-camera without any visual clue that warns players of the incoming attacks. With all these issues, it often feels like one has really no control of what is happening in battle, and it's just raw stats, gear quality, and healing items that truly make the difference, not the player's actual skill. Making matters potentially worse is the scaling system that attempts to keep the challenge level balanced by adjusting the enemies' level depending on that of the player, a balancing shortcut that not all will appreciate.It's really a shame that combat doesn't feel as good as it seemed in pre-release footage, as Biomutant features a decent enemy variety and some solid mechanics. The different weapon types feature different properties and attacks, including the Wung-Fu special attacks performed by inputting simple button combinations. If successful, these attacks let the player charge a special gauge that, once full, lets the character enter a special state capable of unleashing some particularly powerful attacks for a limited amount of time.Together with Wung-Fu attacks, players can also equip four different abilities between Bio-Powers and Psi-Powers. The first type focuses on dealing altered status damage, while the second focuses on elemental damage. The abilities, which require KI to be used, are varied enough, and some synergize quite well, although the bad targeting system makes it hard sometimes to aim them properly. Rounding up the character customization system are passive perks that improve the character's abilities with melee and ranged weapons, bartering abilities, and so on. The system is quite deep, allowing for many different builds that lead to different play styles.Thankfully, the exploration in Biomutant is a little more solid than the story and combat, despite not introducing anything truly new to the open-world formula seen in the past five years or so. Once the linear tutorial area has been completed, it is possible to explore the world fully. It's clear how Experiment 101 went with an approach similar to that of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, letting players explore the world at their own pace. While the whole map is indeed open right from the start, it will not be possible to truly explore every nook and cranny as some areas can only be accessed after acquiring the right vehicles, while others require acquiring the right protective suit that prevents various hazards from killing the character. Even with these locked zones, however, there's plenty to experience right from the start of the game: the different biomes all look great, and they feature a variety of locations like bunkers, ruined cities, caverns, and so on filled with some simple puzzles to complete and all sorts of loot.The loot system featured in Biomutant is also extremely solid, leading to even more customization possibilities. All gear found in the game, including weapons and clothes, can be customized with tons of different items that will alter their stats, add elemental properties, and so on.  As stats are extremely important in the grand scheme of things, due to the sluggish combat system, upgrading items will be extremely important later on, as enemies can hit very hard even on normal difficulty, and their level is always scaled to that of the player.However, if you decide to strictly follow the story, you will not see a whole lot of this diverse world. The main story of Biomutant is rather short, taking only around 15 hours to complete, and focusing just on story missions will only take you to a fraction of the locations available. While the story's main focus is to defeat the four World Eaters gnawing the roots of the Tree of Life, players will also get involved in the Tribe Wars. These Tribes all have their own idea on how to prevent the destruction of the world, and players can choose to ally themselves with any of them, resulting in a definite change of their moral alignment.The moral system in Biomutant isn't particularly deep, but it does influence things beyond the perception other characters have of the protagonist. Depending on the character's Dark or Light Aura values, it is possible to unlock different Psi-Powers. The moral alignment, and that of the tribe you choose to ally yourself with, also influences the story's outcome, adding a little bit of replay value much needed for such a short tale.Although the main story is a little short, Experiment 101 did a generally good job making each story mission distinct. All the battles against the World Eaters are very reminiscent of the boss battles seen in the 3D entries in the Zelda series, forcing players to expose weak points to defeat these massive beasts. Outposts conquering, which is part of the Tribe Wars questline, is also quite varied, as players will have to accomplish different tasks to conquer each one of them. Interestingly enough, it is possible at times to avoid battle altogether and persuade the Outpost leader to relinquish it without shedding blood. This is only possible depending on the character's stats, which adds a little more depth to the character customization system beyond simply increasing combat stats.Unfortunately, side missions are not as varied. While they do provide additional information on the lore and characters, these are mainly fetch quests with occasional combat and puzzle-solving. They also grant some decent loot, so there are some incentives for going through them, despite the lack of variety.One area where Biomutant delivers is the visuals. The game's world looks beautiful even at low settings, featuring some great-looking textures and lighting effects that make each biome pop with colors. Characters look quite detailed as well, contributing to making the game look like an animation movie. The PC version of the game is also incredibly well optimized: the game had no trouble running at 1440p resolution, 60 FPS, mostly high settings on a dated system powered by an i7-3770 CPU, GTX 980 Ti GPU, and 16 GB RAM, also thanks to the dynamic resolution setting that lowers resolution in case the game cannot keep up with the targeted frame rate. On a more modern system powered by an i7-10700 CPU, RTX 3070 GPU, and 16 GB RAM, the game had absolutely no trouble running at 4K resolution, 60 FPS, max settings. No matter your system specs, the wealth of graphics options will allow you to tweak the visuals so that the game can run properly at your desired frame rate.At the end of the day, I cannot say that I hated my time with Biomutant, but I really cannot say that I wholly loved it either. While there isn't much wrong with the game, not counting the terribly sluggish combat, Biomutant doesn't excel at anything except for visuals and atmosphere, featuring only a competent open-world experience that fails to surprise players lacking any real standout feature.PC version tested. Review code provided by the publisher.Biomutant is a competent open-world role-playing game featuring a charming atmosphere and some solid RPG mechanics. Sadly, it fails to stand out due to its by-the-books open-world formula and the sluggish combat system. While the game does work for the most part and there are some interesting ideas here and there, there isn't a lot that Biomutant does better than most open-world games out there, resulting in an experience that is somewhat forgettable.Subscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox© 2023 WCCF TECH INC.

Biomutant,Garri Bagdasarov,PlayStation Universe,https://www.psu.com/reviews/biomutant-review-ps4/," Garri Bagdasarov / May 24, 2021Biomutant PS4 Review – After years and years, it is finally here. Swedish developer Experiment 101‘s first videogame is a refreshing and unique take on a post-apocalyptic world where humanity is gone. All the destruction and pollution humanity left behind has to bread a new species of evolved mammals.That is the set-up to the game but all you need to know is Biomutant is an incredible achievement from a first-time studio and is easily one of the most unique and entertaining worlds you can explore this year.Before you head off on your adventure, you must first create your mammal. You don’t get to have the in-depth character creator you would expect in some MMO titles, but Biomutant allows you to select your character class and the overall build and shape of your Biomutant. Although you select a class from the start, you can always build your character however you want.The Commando class grants a 10% increase to damage from ranged weapons. If you find you don’t enjoy long-range combat, you could always build your character to be more of a melee-focused fighter while keeping that damage bonus.After the destruction of your village, you come out of a long seclusion to discover that the world is dying. The Tree of Life is slowly expiring due to the destruction of the World Eaters. Each of the four World Eaters is destroying the world in their own way. One pollutes the waters, while another goes around murdering and eating all the wildlife. The most damage the World Eaters cause is the damage to the roots of the Tree of Life.That’s the gist of the story, and it’s not much to write home about, but its presentation and delivery make it entertaining to experience. The entire game is narrated as all the remaining mutants speak in their own language and the narrator acts as a translator. Though his performance could have been a little better, I loved the narration presentation specifically because it made me feel like an outsider who just crashlanded on an alien planet.The game’s biggest accomplishment is its world-building. The creatures of the planet continue to use various forms of human technology and Experiment 101 found ways to explain these objects and how they work by the noises they make. What we know as a telephone they refer to as a buzz buzz machine. Another example is that they refer to oil as Igniting Goob Glob.It’s small sprinkles of personality like this that I learned to absolutely love. What made it great for me is how quickly I understood what the characters were referring to. It’s almost like listening to a child who tries to explain what something is by the sounds it makes and what shape it is.Some characters even take on the personality of human people from old world memorabilia that has remained on the planet, such as one character who dresses and acts like Elvis. Biomutant is an open-world experience, and for the most part, it’s a vast, luscious world split up into regions. You will travel to dense forests, water archipelagos that a makeshift jet ski must traverse, and a vast desert, to give you some examples of the environments you will come across.Remnants of civilization are scattered throughout the world. Desolate buildings are yours to explore for precious loot and crafting materials. Railroad tracks and abanded cars litter the world and remind us of a time long gone.Biomutant’s world visually is absolutely stunning. If I didn’t know that I was playing a PS4 game, I would have thought that Biomutant was designed for the PS5. It’s that gorgeous to look at. The world is vast with so much to see that you’ll easily be spending 80 to 100 hours exploring it.Every building you enter gives you a chance to find various items and offers some puzzles to complete. You’ll be presented with a checklist of unique things to discover in the location you’re in, varying from finding rare equipment and loot to something much more precious like an old-world gadget, which can unlock a brand new sidequest. The only downside to all the hard work put into the world is its repetition. By repetition, I mean the reusing of assets and even building layouts. Exploring one house in the game is like exploring all of them because the next house you find has the same layout. An old-world bunker is a great discovery when it first happens, but you’ll think you entered the same bunker on accident the next time because it is identical and the objects in there are all placed in the same position.With a vast world to explore it’s great to have plenty of fast-travel locations, and there are plenty. I never really had to travel far to get where I needed to go. Almost every location you discover comes with a fast travel point. You do get plenty of transportation options though when you do feel like exploring the world.Mounts can be found throughout the world and come in various shapes and sizes; you can unlock a glider to traverse through the air for short periods of time, and as I mentioned before, a make-shift jetski to traverse the waters.One of the game’s most important aspects comes in the form of Tribal Wars. The game features six tribes you can align yourself with. Three tribes battle for the light and three for the dark and each of the tribes has its own idea of a better world. One tribe wants to unite all the other tribes under one banner, while another wants to let the world end and purge the remaining tribes and rebuild society in their image.Each tribe controls a vast area of territory. You must attack your tribes’ rival strongholds to capture more regions until they are weakened enough for you to capture their main base. As you capture strongholds, you notice that your allies will begin to occupy locations of that region, providing you with less opposition to deal with as you explore.Once a tribe’s main base is captured, you must choose between either killing the tribal leader or persuading them to join your side. A nice addition to this system is you can always join a different tribe whenever you want as long as their main base is still standing, so you don’t always have to stay on one side.As you may have guessed, the game features a morality system. Your decisions have consequences and will determine what ending you’ll acquire at the end of the game. Unfortunately, these decisions are right on the nose. and every decision is black and white. You either choose to save or help someone, or you don’t. That’s how obvious these decisions are.These decisions come in the form of a light angle and a dark devil that appear and mock each other after a decision is made. These interactions are cringy to listen to and, in all honesty, didn’t need to be present. It took away from the immersion of being an outsider having everything translated to me to having something that’s equivalent to annoying background noise.There is plenty of the aforementioned loot to find in Biomutant, netting you new weapons, armor, and crafting materials. Biomutant has a vast and robust crafting and modding system. Your furry character can look however you want them to look. Put on a full samurai armor if it makes you happy or go wild and dress them up with a giant panda mask, with a jean jacket and a skirt. It’s all up to you.Crafting gear can be quite fun, especially the weapons where you have various options from the hilt to the type of melee weapon you want. You can have a giant buster sword, much like Final Fantasy’s Cloud wields, or you can go and make Thor’s hammer Mjǫllnir. It’s really up to you. You can then mod the weapons with unique items like scissors and pencils for extra bonuses. Yes, pencils add more damage to your weapon.When I first went into Biomutant, I thought I would go into an action game like Devil May Cry. If you’re going into it with the same mindset, you’re going to be disappointed.Biomutant is more of an action RPG, and so it requires a lot more patience. It took me some time to get used to how combat flows, but I had a blast when I finally understood it. The combat heavily relies on parrying your opponent’s attacks and stringing together all the skills in your arsenal to come out victorious. Melee attacking all your opponents won’t get you very far.Combining melee attacks with your long-range attacks and psionic powers to overcome your enemies is a visual spectacle to behold but also the only way to deal with the game’s more dangerous opposition.As I mentioned, parrying attacks is a must, but it is pretty easy and forgiving. Three icons appear over an enemy’s head, it’s an indicator they’re about to attack in the same way they do in Spider-Man and the Batman Arkham franchise.When performing successful parries, opponents get stunned, allowing you to launch smaller enemies into the air and perform aerial combos, or with larger foes, your Biomutant will jump on top of a large enemy and attack their vulnerable, exposed head.Besides your usual fisticuffs, you get access to Psionic Powers. These powers essentially turn you into a Jedi. You can shoot lighting out of your hands or pick up enemies and throw them around with telekinetic powers. Unfortunately, you can’t have them all, as some of these powers are linked to your Light and Dark alignment.You also gain access to Mutations that provide unique abilities like bouncing mushrooms that allow you to jump higher or bounce enemies around the environment. My favorite is a sticky bubble that you create around yourself which causes enemies to stick to it. Every small enemy that you run into with the bubble gets stuck on the outside, and it starts to feel like you’re playing Katamari Damacy.Biomutatnt doesn’t get a clean bill of health, though. I ran into a lot of technical issues, which have become expected from open-world games. There were plenty of times when markers wouldn’t appear for me to interact with, forcing me to abandon a quest for a later time. I even restarted the game, hoping it would fix the problem, but it didn’t always work.Another issue I had was a weird shadow glitch. Sometimes shadows from trees will block the camera as if the shadow was an object. It felt like putting a camera next to a wall and the camera going behind the wall, but the wall itself isn’t translucent. It was a real pain.The most important issue to discuss is that if you play Biomutant the game crashes a lot. Those looking to play without a patch are looking at a game crash every hour, if not more. On top of that, those playing on a PS5 will have serious issues, as we were informed by the publisher that the game hasn’t been optimised for PS5.Though a day one patch has been released, the game still suffers occasionally but they are now few and far between.Biomutant is a refreshing and exciting take on the open-world post-apocalyptic world. The game thrives off of the world created by Experiment 101 with some of the best world-building I’ve ever experienced. Combat got me hooked once I finally got the hang of it and exploring Biomutant’s gorgeous world never got old.It’s just a shame that some technical issues and a blatant black and white morality system hold it back from true greatness in today’s market. Nevertheless, if you’re looking for something new and exciting, Biomutant is the game you’ve been waiting for and it lives up to what we were all anticipating.Biomutatnt releases for PS4 on May 25, 2021, and is available on PS5 via backwards compatibility,Review code provided by publisherBiomutant is a fun title with some amazing visuals and a huge open world to explore. Experiment 101 have gone out of their way to make you feel like you're a first-time visitor to an unknown landscape. Though its morality system leaves a lot to be desired there is plenty here to enjoy. Despite suffering from some technical issues, none of it hindered me from pouring hours and hours into the game. If you're looking for something fresh, unique, and exciting, Biomutant is a brand new IP that you should play.

Biomutant,Mike Williams,PCMag,https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/biomutant-for-pc,"Terrific exploration, tedious combatBiomutant has the makings of a truly special game, as it features deep character customization and an intriguing, beautiful world to explore. Unfortunately, combat and progression issues prevent it from being an all-time great.In some ways, the $59.99 Biomutant is a deeply weird and unique action-RPG. Early on, you encounter a humanoid, ferret-monk talking in a Star Wars-style alienspeak that’s translated by the game’s English storybook narrator. Later on, the monk—named Out-of-Date—is dressed like a greaser and humming Elvis-themed pidgin. In other ways, Biomutant is the result of the game industry working away at the open-world whetstone. It's a vast world of action combat, copious loot and locations to discover, mounts to tame and travel upon, and a variety of local gangs to subdue. In terms of mechanics, you’ve experienced something like it if you’ve played an open-world game in the past decade. Given its indie beginnings, however, Biomutant doesn’t quite land near its AAA brethren in every aspect. Still, Biomutant is an intriguing and exciting PC game, despite frustrating combat and poorly explained game mechanics.Biomutant begins in the ruins of our world. Megacorporation Toxanol polluted the Earth to the point that it mutated and fought back, extinguishing humanity. In our place is a race of tiny humanoid mammals; there’s no real analog to any one type of animal, merely a semi-marsupial mélange. You are the Ronin, a young orphan of an ancient tragedy who must take up a blade and save the world. (Or destroy it, as player choice is Biomutant’s hook.) During character creation, you can choose between six breeds, each proficient in different areas. Then you mutate your character, with its genetic code determining the warrior’s overall stats and general look. Finally, you can pick your class: Dead-Eye, Commando, Psi-Freak, Saboteur, or Sentinel. Each offers different, unlockable perks as you play.Biomutant throws a lot at you in its early hours. There’s a rather forgettable light/dark morality system, a war between competing animal tribes, and the main quest. The latter sees you set out to save the Tree of Life by defeating the World Eaters that feast on its massive roots. To do so, you must upgrade the Ronin by collecting Bio Points, Psi Points, and Upgrade Points, and dropping those points in new Psi-Powers, Perks, and Wung-Fu abilities. There’s an extensive crafting system, too.Biomutant offers significant mutant-building flexibility, but it would have benefited from some power consolidation. Not all powers feel meaningful, especially some combat-focused skills, and the differentiation between ability subsets, such as Psi-Powers and Bio-Genetics, could probably be wiped away. At times, it feels like Biomutant adds a lot of cruft to compete with its AAA counterparts, rather than asking if it's necessary.Despite the development team at Experiment 101 being a relatively small squad—under 20 full-time employees—Biomutant visually punches above its weight. The world that stretches out in front of you is gorgeous. There are rolling plains of grass dotted with flowers of every hue that sway in the gentle breeze. In addition, your journey takes you across small hamlets and ruined cities, through the contaminated marshes and vast deserts. At the center of all of it is the Tree of Life, a massive structure that shifts as you continue your journey, a giant monument to your progress. Its roots tower over some parts of the landscape, making it a sight to behold. Experiment 101 decided to forgo the Ubisoft-style towers that categorize many open-world titles. There’s no structures that reveal each region’s landscape; you just explore on foot. Generally, that exploration is rewarded with a new location to loot, Tribal fort to overcome, or hazardous zone to survive.Hazard zones prevent you from just going wherever you please. As you wander the map, you’ll find areas bathed in a thick, colored fog or haze that usually corresponds to a different hazard type: Heat, Biohazard, Cold, Radioactivity, or Hypoxia (lack of oxygen). When you enter those zones, the effect count upward to 100%, at which point you’ll start losing health. You can tackle hazard zones by combining gear with resistances attached, raising your own innate resistance, or finding the specific suit set for that hazard. It gives you options: Do you try to brave a hazard zone for a short period of time, or wait until you have the resistance to tackle it?Then there are vehicles. Each of the four World Eaters requires a new tactic to tackle. In one region, the Googlide jetski lets you traverse polluted waters, while the giant Mekton suit in another region lets you survive without air. Combined with the hazard areas and lack of towers, Biomutant truly pushes the feeling of exploration. Wandering untouched through a biohazard zone’s green haze is an accomplishment. Biomutant tries to do so much, and succeeds at a good deal of it, but it falters, too. Its combat is similar to many other action-RPGs, with your character hacking and slashing through foes. The problem is the hack-and-slash combat isn’t as tight and tuned as Nier: Automata’s, and you don’t fight control as you do in Immortals Fenyx Rising or The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.You tend to fight large enemy groups, typically with one, plus-sized ringer. This usually breaks down to slashing and parrying the smaller enemies, but being unable to commit to a combo because of the attacks from the big ones. Psi-Powers, such as Freeze and Blaze, might affect the smaller foes, but the big ones sometimes ignore them outright. So, fighting is just dodge, dodge, dodge, parry, shoot, slash. It feels slow and tedious, whittling down the small enemies until you can focus on the larger one. I’d like more direct control of the battlefield and the tools required to fight the many different enemies. Biomutant also struggles to explain itself at times. One quest demanded that I find an item that was hidden inside bushes. Slashing the bush didn’t work. The Blaze ability didn’t set the bush on fire. Running at the bush did nothing. The answer? Dodging through the bush. That’s not particularly intuitive solution, and the game didn't present that as an option.Some of the boss fights are equally obtuse. The second boss is invincible unless you expose his weak spots. How you do that is unexplained, and I only came to the answer after two previous, failed attempts. Still, the fight remained a struggle, even after discovering that solution, due to the small window to damage the boss. It wasn’t a hard fight, it was just a tedious one that lacked clear signposting. A game should give you the information needed to succeed. It’s a shame that Biomutant stumbles in this area, because it’s these tiny cuts that add up over time. Biomutant is a looker, but it won’t stress your PC. Biomutant’s minimum specifications demand an AMD FX-8350 or Intel Core i5-4690K CPU, Nvidia GeForce GTX 960 or Radeon R9 380 GPU, 8GB of RAM, and 25GB of storage space. The recommended specs kick that up to an AMD Ryzen 5 1600 or Intel Core i7-6700K CPU, Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660Ti or Radeon RX 590 GPU, and 16GB of RAM. That’s not recent PC hardware, so if you keep your rig relatively up-to-date, you should be fine.My gaming PC houses an AMD Ryzen 5 3600X CPU, Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 GPU, and 24GB of RAM. I had no problem running Biomutant at 3840 by 2160 resolution, with most of the additional visual features turned on. There are options for draw distance, resolution scaling, and frame rate limits, but it’s missing other graphics settings, such as ray tracing and ambient occlusion, to really tailor your visual experience. Otherwise, Biomutant ran at a mostly locked 60 frames per second on my PC.With Biomutant, developer Experiment 101 created an intriguing world that contains a beautiful aesthetic and a strong feeling of exploration. The team's filled it to the brim with loot and progression systems that really let you craft your character. Unfortunately, that complexity isn’t always needed, and areas that should be explained aren’t.Biomutant isn’t a fantastic game, but it’s a good one that comes with caveats. It’s different, clutching all its influences close to its chest with such intense love that you'll want the studio to be able to build upon it. You'll want that sequel or expansion. The first step wasn’t as strong as it could be, but Biomutant’s future could be a bright one with some refinement. For more Steam game reviews and previews, check out PCMag's Steam Curator(Opens in a new window) page.

Home » Reviews » Biomutant Review – Does Not TransmuteStanding apart in a crowded segment of the video game industry is surely no easy feat for a small, indie team. I imagine that the many open-world RPGs funded by enormous publishers must make the notion of competing against AAA production values immensely daunting; in order to peacock, then, such a team would have to think outside the box and get properly creative, maybe even a tad bizarre. Described as an open-world, post-apocalyptic Wung-Fu fable RPG, developer Experiment 101’s Biomutant feels as though it’s a labor of love built around that ethos. First announced way back in 2017, a team of 20 has been busy at work forging its first-ever game, a unique sandbox experience that is in many ways, unlike anything I’ve played before. Unfortunately, despite the impressive volume of different role-playing systems and gameplay mechanics, as well as the care that has gone into forging lore for its bizarre world, the scale of Biomutant’s ambition ultimately feels as though it’s proved too much for such a young team.Frequently throughout my 30 or so hour playthrough, I found myself yearning for more substance and depth across the board, from combat and progression to the thrust of its main story and the narrative implications that its choice/consequence branching dialog system promises to deliver. It’s a shame because Biomutant is also thoroughly entertaining at times; it has its moments, and it has some clever ideas, but it never really evolves into anything beyond that.Biomutant begins with a superb character creation system, which might actually be one of its best features. I love the way that each mutant’s breed and class not only determines their stats but also their appearance, which puts a novel spin on the usual moving up and down of sliders in other RPGs. There’s a level of depth here that allows you to get really innovative with your design.From there, a linear section that introduces its strange world, replete with plenty of backstory and lore. We learn that the greedy company Toxonol’s pollution has blighted the Tree of Life that binds the world together; now dying as it drowns in toxic waste and is gnawed at by four monsters known as World Eaters, it’s up to us to beat them back and save the day. All of this is narrated by an unnamed character whose voice is, at first, rather soothing and compelling. Over the first few hours of the game, he offers context to the goings-on of the world, describes its unusual sights, and even chips in with one or two witty lines that help set a whimsical tone. But then it becomes apparent that he also acts as a fill-in for the lack of voice-acting throughout the game, speaking for every NPC in every dialog exchange. This is, frankly, an extraordinary design decision that isn’t just highly annoying to listen to but has the rather damaging knock-on effect of strangling the personality and charm of the various NPCs in the game. It’s so hard to connect with or care about anybody when they’re being spoken for all the time.That would be an issue for any game, but it’s a major problem for Biomutant in particular given how foreign and bizarre its world is. It absolutely needs memorable personalities to draw players into the intrigue of the story, but with narration constantly translating gibberish noises I never really felt as though I got to know anybody. For reasons I won’t spoil, this lack of motivation to care about the character’s within the world hampers what is otherwise a clever and consequential story decision later in the game.But honestly, despite what is a commendable but ultimately lackluster attempt to weave branching dialog and morality mechanics into its story, Biomutant’s best moments have nothing to do with its narrative design. The martial-arts combat system and traversal mechanics are easily the highlights of the gameplay experience. Chaining together different combos and “special attacks” is really quite fun, and combat generally feels fast and fluid on PS5 running at 60 fps, even if the automatic lock-in is somewhat inconsistent.At first, the sheer number of different combos, available upgrades, and strange nomenclature is a little intimidating, but it’s not long until I found myself right at home switching between different weapons, psi-powers, mutations, and building my Super Wung Fu to unleash devastating moves. It certainly makes grinding combat for XP much more engaging when there are so many different possibilities to make each encounter feel fresh.Although, I must admit to defaulting to a small handful of easy, familiar moves right the way through, and one certainly doesn’t have to get all that involved with the nitty-gritty in order to beat the game. And in fact, as with many of Biomutant’s gameplay systems, you’re not really forced to engage with it all that much if you don’t want to. In the case of combos, I think that’s fine as I appreciate not having to study dozens of different combos, but other facets of combat like Mutations, Perks, and Psi-Powers needed more fleshing out. All too quickly I felt like I’d upgraded them as far as I could, and in most combat encounters I never really used them anyway.Across the board, in fact, there are a lot of customization options in Biomutant that almost feel like they’ve been included for the sake of it. Don’t get me wrong, it’s nice that one can modify the appearance of vehicles, for example, or change the appearance of an armor set, but I wish more time had been spent in better fleshing out one or two mechanics rather than including several shallow ones.The tribal system is perhaps the most underwhelming of Biomutant’s major gameplay features. Initially, it presents itself as an intriguing battle for territory amongst several warring tribes with which you can ally yourself with and then slowly take over the map in the name of your pledged tribe by defeating outposts and forts. In reality, the process of actually retaking these strongholds isn’t particularly exciting and is very repetitive.The tribal system actually correlates to another of Biomutant’s major mechanics: the “Aura” morality system, which classifies your actions throughout the game as either light or dark. Allying yourself with a “light” tribe, for example, makes sense if you’ve decided to shape your character around that moral distinction, while you might instead opt to remain dark if you’ve chosen the opposite. The problem with both of these systems is multifaceted but ultimately boils down to my earlier complaints about depth, or lack thereof. My decision to go for a “light” playthrough didn’t feel as though it had any major impact on the world, and the fact that it was also quite reversible lessened the consequence of that initial decision to the point where I didn’t really care about the mechanic by the game’s end. Moreover, I actually ended up uniting the tribes and ending the tribe war hours and hours before defeating the World Eaters. I had hoped these two elements of the game would all tie together in an epic finale, but they’re disappointingly disparate.I think that’s a key takeaway for me overall from my time with Biomutant: it ticks so many boxes in terms of the sheer number of features in the game, but they’re just not executed in a way that makes me excited to engage with them. Even the enormous volume of side quests are just there to make up numbers rather than ever intrigue you with any quality storytelling or gameplay. You’re just fetching items for other NPCs on either side of fetching items for yourself, most of which prove largely superfluous to proceedings.It’s such a pity, too, because the concept of Biomutant’s story and world has so much potential. I really think it could have benefited from having a smaller scope with more effort spent on bolstering its narrative, characters, and opting to really flesh out its tribal system. It ends up being a by-the-numbers RPG experience that leans on repetition and fetch questing when I was so hoping the experience of playing it would prove as unique as its unusual premise.That isn’t the case, sadly, though I think it would be unfair of me not to conclude by stating that I did certainly did enjoy some of my time with Biomutant. Landing combos, and zipping around the sandbox is amusing enough, and the game’s progression systems offer the usual RPG hook. But overall it’s a case of light entertainment and not truly innovative design.Review BlockFairCopyright © 2022 GAMURS Group

Biomutant,Steven Scaife,Slant Magazine,https://www.slantmagazine.com/games/review-biomutant-is-all-about-the-loot-in-both-rewarding-and-exhausting-ways/,"Even after getting used to everything that Biomutant throws at you, the array of options at your disposal spreads the game rather thin.Though plenty of open-world action games have subsumed RPG elements to varying degrees of complexity over the years, the ambitions of Biomutant extend beyond the largely decorative progress bars of its contemporaries. Even with the aid of a marginally helpful tutorial, the sheer amount of stuff going on in the game can initially feel overwhelming, an issue compounded by its affinity for cutesy jargon that sounds like the result of force-feeding Redwall books to Dr. Seuss. The whimsical British narrator constantly chimes in to translate the gibberish languages spoken by the game’s animal characters, while staying amusingly faithful to terminology, as a gun is a “pew-pew” and quest objectives sometimes come in half-intelligible sentences like “find Klink to stronken the klunkfist.”At the start, the narrator urges you to assign your humanoid mutated animal a class, race, and physique that affects its attributes. And then, soon enough, you find yourself in a post-apocalyptic open world, which is absent of humans and at the center of which is an enormous tree that’s under attack by monsters gnawing at its life-giving roots. You’re urged to take a side in an ongoing tribe war, but you can also start building the separate vehicles that will allow you to take on the world-eaters across a story, while threadbare, is still beholden to overlong sections of dialogue. Additionally, Biomutant features rideable creatures to be tamed; an offshoot of its morality system tied to how people remember you during childhood flashbacks; five elemental resistances, four of which you strengthen or weaken during character creation and can further augment through what armor you use and where you spend upgrade points (which can also be saved up to unlock spell-like abilities); and, of course, color-coded loot.And yet, even after getting used to everything that Biomutant throws at you, the array of options at your disposal spreads the game rather thin, leaving precious little room for depth. Though certain characters respond differently based on your moral alignment, this system is confounded if you don’t rigidly commit to light or dark and offers dialogue that doesn’t always make sense in context. Likewise, the differences between weapon types are primarily in damage output rather than meaningful shifts in play style, to the point where the button combinations you unlock on a per-weapon basis are all largely the same.Biomutant seems most committed to presenting players with a variety of options rather than ensuring that any of them are particularly good in the first place. The only one that stands out is the in-depth loot system, where the enhancements or alterations you’ve crafted for an item are not only visible in menu close-ups but also on your mutant character while you run around the game’s open world. The firearms in particular are pleasantly modular, allowing you to cobble disparate types of junk into extremely DIY weapons that might have, say, an ordinary wooden handle in addition to what appears to be the nozzle of a ray gun, while a melee weapon might have a pencil sticking out of it. With a respectable number of visually distinct combinations, Biomutant manages to make its loot treadmill feel rewarding in a way that thinner mechanics like a limited range of psychic powers never really achieve.Of course, even when Biomutant appears to be in its element, interface irritations abound. Crafting depends on scavenged materials that may be sporadically acquired from combat, from breakable resource totems that don’t always stand out against the foliage, or (most often) from scrapping items that you don’t need. But you can’t immediately break down any loot on the spot, as you have to page through your inventory one item at a time and check each one individually (there’s no option to sort according to resource yield). And because crafting requires the player to open an entirely separate menu tab, any time that you realize that you’re short on materials means quitting out to again sift through the inventory—and that there are five distinct types of raw materials only compounds the issue.There are other frustrations, too, like enemy health bars and attack indicators all presented in the same indistinct shade of gray, as well as a pointless variety of healing items that only pave the way for more inventory management. At times, these complications seem to suggest that the developers at Sweden-based Experiment 101 are consciously rebelling against the streamlining of so many modern games, which are designed to let players quickly and painlessly suck up crafting materials while they vacantly shamble between waypoints. There is, for example, no on-screen minimap, as if to encourage players to locate points of interest by sight and therefore engage with the environment in a more direct and thoughtful fashion.However, where other games tend to have a greater purpose and complexity behind more granular mechanics that demand closer attention from the player, Biomutant remains a rather simplified, if overstuffed, game of loot-hoovering. In practice, you’re still chasing objective markers and wandering salvageable areas in hopes of spotting the “interact with object” indicator. But while Biomutant’s breadth of options does indeed make that familiar process more rewarding than the norm, it never quite offsets the accompanying increase in tedium.The game was reviewed using a code provided by Evolve PR.Steven Nguyen Scaife is a freelance writer whose work has appeared in Buzzfeed News, Fanbyte, Polygon, The Awl, Rock Paper Shotgun, EGM, and others.

Learn more.An open-world RPG aimed at childrenBiomutant is a charming open-world RPG that is blatantly aimed at children, with a low difficulty level and overly cutesy tone that will likely put off older gamers. Combat is fun with a large range of craftable weapons and mutant powers at your disposal, but boring puzzles and a barebones story means there isn’t much else here to keep you captivated.Placing the furry critters of Kung Fu Panda in the post-apocalyptic setting of Fallout for an unofficial crossover is one of the oddest matchups you could think of for an open-world RPG, yet Biomutant looks to have done just that with surprising success. While nukes haven’t decimated the world of BioMutant, it’s repeatedly made clear throughout your adventure that pollution has adversely affected both the environment and its inhabitants, supposedly killing off humans many decades prior.  Anthropomorphic furry critters ranging from wheelchair-bound otters to brutish badgers wielding makeshift longswords now roam the world instead. You take control of one of these mutated creatures with the task of saving the world from an upcoming natural disaster. It’s an interesting and unique premise, and with multiple innovations plucked from some of the very best games in recent history – from Breath of the Wild to Borderlands – it seemingly has all the hallmarks to be an enjoyable open-world adventure.But is it good enough to qualify for our Best PS4 games and Best Xbox One games lists? I’d argue not, with an overbearing narrator and gentle difficulty curve combining to create a tone that only children will likely appreciate, failing to offer a more widespread appeal that the likes of Ratchet and Clank and Crash Bandicoot have previously mastered. Biomutant’s story revolves around the world you inhabit, which is gradually recovering from pollution that devastated it decades before. There are reminders of this apocalyptic past scattered all over the map, with abandoned towns, lifeless oil fields and lakes of toxic sludge making up the world. But thanks to the mountain-sized Tree of Life in the centre of the map, the world has largely recovered with lush green meadows and thickets of rainforests turning the post-apocalyptic world into a gorgeous and vibrant landscape. When riding across the map, I’d often rotate the camera around just to soak up the eye-catching vistas on display. However, Biomutant’s story sees this peaceful world under threat, with various monsters called ‘World Eaters’ gnawing away at the roots of the Tree of Life to rid the world of its restoration powers and put the various fuzzy-haired creatures at risk of imminent doom. Your main objective is to take down these monstrous threats. It’s a very simple and straightforward story, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. But additional padding – such as countless fetch quests – needlessly stretches out the campaign to last around 15 hours. With such a simple plot, the strength of the story relies heavily on the zany personalities of the many friendly creatures you meet. There’s little depth to these characters, but they all have memorable quirks such as a fox who’s obsessed with trains and a peace-loving panda. However, there’s no voice acting for any of the characters, with an omnipresent narrator instead translating their growls and garbles. By having one narrator vocalise all of the game’s dialogue, conversations feel mind-numbingly repetitive quickly, while also diluting the personalities of the individual characters. I personally don’t think the narrator was required at all, as the voiceless characters of Animal Crossing are far more enjoyable to interact with than anyone in Biomutant. To make matters worse, the narrator constantly chimes in to narrate your in-game actions, whether you’re battling enemies, solving puzzles or simply exploring the world. There is an option in the settings to reduce the frequency of the narrator’s outbursts, but I still felt it far too obtrusive after pushing the slider all the way to the bottom. The narrator feels extremely patronising too, and while the game is clearly aimed at children, it’s far too simplistic for any but the youngest of kids. This isn’t helped by the frustratingly childish synonyms for various items, with trains called ‘chugga chuggas’ and saddles referred to as “sit-tights’. I’m not sure which demographic Biomutant is aimed at, as anyone over 12 will probably wretch as the cutesy tone, while younger players could feel overwhelmed by the various RPG systems in play.Biomutant also features a morality system and branching story paths, although these aren’t as impactful as I’d have liked. The morality system is binary to such an extent that you have an angel and devil sitting on your shoulders to commentate on your decisions, making it a simplistic tussle between ‘good’ and ‘evil’ rather than facing you with morally-divisive dilemmas. While your actions will determine the final cutscene and alter the odd dialogue line from characters, they seemingly still have a minimal impact on the story overall, although will help you to unlock certain psionic powers. While there isn’t much substance to Biomutant’s story, it has plenty of style. The cartoonish visuals are one of Biomutant’s greatest strengths, with the protagonist’s individual strands of hair visibly blowing in the wind, and the many weather effects – from rain storms to snowy blizzards – doing an excellent job of creating an immersive atmosphere. It’s a lovely looking game. Biomutant offers the player a large number of options for combat by adopting multiple open-world RPG mechanics. You can upgrade melee weapons and guns with loot, or focus more on unlocking psionic powers so you can hurl lightning balls at foes or even freeze them in place with an icy blast. And since you’re shorter than most enemies you face, you’re afforded a great deal of mobility. You can comfortably jump and dodge most projectiles, making you feel like a super-powered ninja. There’s even a combo-move system in play, with on-screen prompts helping those with poor memories to execute some stylish attacks with ease. However, I feel they may be a tad too complex for young children, who are seemingly Biomutant’s target audience. Unfortunately, there’s a small variety of enemy types, with most encounters involving large brutes with powerful melee attacks and smaller foes equipped with pistols, snipers or assault rifles. This meant that the best tactic for combat was almost always moving side to side while unleashing a flurry of bullets, especially since you have unlimited ammunition. This made enemy encounters feel easy and repetitive for the most part. But the most infuriating aspect of combat is the mid-battle health restoration of enemies who are lured too far away from their starting territory. There were many occasions where I came close to downing a giant grunt, only for them to start casually walking away with a replenished health bar. It happened so frequently that I actively avoided combat encounters in the latter half of the game. The five boss battles were more enjoyable to fight against, as you’re put at the helm of various nutty vehicles – from a Titanfall-esque exosuit to a squid-shaped submarine – to help you take down the colossal villains. I wish I was afforded more time in these vehicles, as they helped to vary up the combat rather than following well-trodden open-world trends. There’s also a secondary main objective in Biomutant, which involves helping your allied tribe conquer all of the other settlements spread across the map. But these conquests just involve fighting off numerous waves of generic enemy grunts with few twists to the formula. You’re at least rewarded with a unique weapon after conquering each tribe, but I personally preferred using my own crafted guns, making such efforts feel redundant. Biomutant encourages exploration by hiding loot in desolate towns, abandoned factories and grimy sewers. However, most of the loot I uncovered was unfortunately generic with underwhelming stats – I can’t count how many woolly hats I uncovered. The very best loot is often located within hazardous environments that require you to equip the necessary gear to explore without taking damage. However, I rarely felt the loot on offer was enough of an incentive to venture off the beaten track and delay my main objectives. It doesn’t help that Biomutant’s map feels empty and sparse, which is admittedly expected for a post-apocalyptic world, but still nevertheless a disappointment. I was, however, impressed with Biomutant’s performance. I encountered a couple of glitches throughout my playthrough, such as occasionally being unable to mount my rideable companion. But there was no sign of any game-breaking bugs to ruin the immersion, which is rare for an open-world game at launch. I did notice a few framerate dips despite using a Radeon RX 6800 GPU, but this was mostly after fast travelling which is more understandable. Loading speeds were also very quick, although this will largely depend on your own hardware. Biomutant is a charming third-person adventure set in a gorgeous world with a post-apocalyptic twist. However, by embracing numerous RPG tropes and rarely excelling at one particular mechanic, Biomutant will likely feel hollow and generic to anyone who’s played the likes of Breath of the Wild or any other modern open-world game. Combat is a highlight with so many craftable weapons and unlockable power-ups providing a huge arsenal, but the low number of enemy variations meant I was never really pushed to stray from the simple run-and-gun tactic. This isn’t helped by the low difficulty level, especially for puzzles which feel more of a hassle than a satisfying brain teaser. With so many zany characters here, Biomutant’s strength should have lied in the story. Unfortunately, the overbearing narrator takes the focus away from the many furry-haired personalities, turning dialogue and cutscenes into a tedious chore. The childish tone and gentle difficulty curve will also likely put off older players, limiting the appeal to young children looking to play their very first open-world adventure.You’re looking for a game for a childWith a storybook charm and a gentle difficulty curve, Biomutant is best played by children who want to try out the open-world genre for the first time. You’re looking for an innovative open-world RPGWhile the combat and crafting system are both good fun, there isn’t really anything here that hasn’t been done before. If you’ve played any other modern open-world RPG, you’ve probably seen it all before. Biomutant is a charming open-world RPG that is blatantly aimed at children, with a low difficulty level and overly cutesy tone likely putting off older gamers. Combat is fun with a large range of craftable weapons and mutant powers at your disposal, but boring puzzles and a barebones story means there isn’t much else here to keep you captivated.You can alter the frequency of the narrator in the settings, but you can’t turn it off completely as it’s required for dialogue. You can play the PS4 version on the PS5, but the PS5 upgrade won’t launch until later this year.

Biomutant,George Yang,Washington Post,https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/reviews/biomutant-review/,"This article was published more than 1 year agoIf you can believe it, biodiversity and mutation are at the core of the narrative and mechanics of “Biomutant.” That’s not always a strength. The game’s weird, Frankenstein design cobbles together so many elements owed to its contemporaries that the game often feels like less than the sum of its parts.Right off the bat, “Biomutant” provides a huge swath of customization options. For your player character, you can select different breeds that have advantages in certain stats, and that establishes your baseline look. The Hyla, for example, is a hyena-based species that focuses more on defense; it has a slight advantage in the Armor stat. The Fip breed is nerdy-looking with buck teeth, and is more naturally inclined toward Psionic powers; it can recover energy faster for its mind-based attacks.On top of that, you can also select better stats that in turn mutate your character. Putting more focus into Vitality causes your player character to have a much bigger head, whereas specializing in Agility gives you longer legs. The customization here is pretty impressive and truly lives up to the game’s title.The world is a post-apocalyptic one, the result of corporate greed by a toxic chemical company in the “old world.” Anthropomorphic animals — such as your character — roam the earth. It’s a truly beautiful world that attempts to world-build by calling old contraptions, like washing machines and toilets, silly names like “clothes-soakers” and “flush-stools,” respectively. These naming conventions that the world’s inhabitants come up with add quite a bit of charm to the world and its overall cartoonish tone.I’ve already played the trilogy. Should I buy ‘Mass Effect Legendary Edition’?“Biomutant” borrows many mechanics from its contemporaries. Scavenging a once populated city’s ruins reminds me of looking for materials in “The Last of Us Part II.” The open world exploration is very reminiscent of “Days Gone” and modern “Assassin’s Creed” games, where you can pretty much explore to your heart’s content as you stumble across a world riddled with camps and side quests.Of course, the biggest elephant in the room is how much it reminds of “Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.” The overall goal of “Biomutant” is to take down four giant monsters called the World Eaters and restore the Tree of Life. Sound familiar? You even get a glider. With how open the world is, you can set your own pace: either beelining the critical path to the World Eaters or just taking it slow to discover all the different characters the world has to offer.“Biomutant” even has a morality system of Light and Dark, incredibly similar to the Paragon and Renegade dynamic in “Mass Effect.” The choices you make throughout the game can change how other characters interact with you. If you chose to execute an NPC rather than work with them, that could have ripple effects.It may seem unfair to judge “Biomutant” to the standards of games that have garnered “Game of the Year” praise and accolades, but the way these mechanics are implemented here are so obvious and stick out. It’s not a bad thing and these mechanics are competent enough, but if you’ve played any of the games previously mentioned, it’s incredibly hard not to notice it. However, I am impressed that Experiment 101, a studio that seemingly has fewer than 30 employees, created such an expansive world.“Biomutant” offers many different kinds of weapons, including melee varieties like one-handed and two-handed swords, and crushing hammer weapons, as well as ranged ones such as pistols and rifles. You’ll come across different parts that you can combine together to create new weapons, as well. The loot you find can almost be overwhelming at times. It’s great that “Biomutant” offers so much choice in how you customize your character, gear and approach.The biggest problem with “Biomutant” is the minute to minute combat. Most attacks feel absolutely weightless. There’s no impact behind the swing of the sword. Enemies can feel like damage sponges, especially the bigger ones. When you hit them, they don’t seem to stagger; in fact, they usually end up finishing their attack animations anyway and knocking you off your feet. You can parry attacks by blocking at the right moment, but it always feels slightly off, and the window of opportunity isn’t very forgiving. I was left wishing the combat mechanics were closer to “Ghost of Tsushima,” which were very well refined. It’s not a good sign to walk away from one game wishing you had played another.‘Resident Evil VIII’ rekindles the illogical, weird magic of the seriesYou can level up to earn upgrade points and unlock special combo attacks and abilities to perform during battle, such as spewing toxic waste that forces your enemy to fight against their own comrades, or leaving a trail of fire when you dash toward an enemy. Triggering special combo attacks feels like a “Devil May Cry” game. For example, sometimes you’ll need to double jump into the air and then shoot to activate a combo attack, or finish an attack chain and then press another button to execute a combo finisher.The gameplay attempts to be flashy, much like the aforementioned “Devil May Cry” games. But without any of the “oomph” behind your attacks, it feels shallow and it’s just not fun to engage in combat encounters. Additionally, there doesn’t seem to be any sort of manual targeting mechanic as far I could tell. So fighting multiple enemies at a time, which you will often do, feels like a chore if you’re trying to focus on taking out enemies one by one.It’s such a shame that the combat feels so undercooked because the rest of the game is decent, or sometimes great, such as with the environmental design. I’ll often come across a cool new area but then roll my eyes when I get into a fight. I really do enjoy exploring what the open world has to offer and listening to the soft soundtrack while learning more about the characters through their side quests.The developers did mention that there is a Day 1 patch coming, so hopefully that will fix certain issues, such as clipping through the bottom of the terrain or graphical issues, both of which I’ve experienced. I’m not expecting the patch to provide an overhaul to the combat, however.“Biomutant” is a weird amalgamation of many standard video game mechanics, almost in a meta kind of sense, just like an actual mutant. There are so many borrowed ideas that you’re bound to find something you like about this game. There’s a lot of customization to personally tailor your own preferences, and that’s the beauty of it. It’s got a lot of charm and personality too. If only the combat’s feel had just been fine tuned to feel more impactful, then the overall experience could have been that much better.George Yang is a freelance writer covering video games and culture.

Biomutant,Michael Goroff,EGM,https://egmnow.com/biomutant-review/,"On its surface, Biomutant might look like an evolution of the kinds of character-based, 3D platformers that defined the mid-to-late ’90s. The critter protagonist was a staple of that era: Banjo and Kazooie, Spyro, Conker, even Gex. For gamers of a certain age, seeing Biomutant’s anthropomorphic ronin—complete with makeshift weaponry and a cool eye patch—traveling about the land, getting in fights and restoring peace to the world probably triggers a wave of nostalgia and a hope that the kind of epic, animal-based game we imagined as kids has finally been realized.But gaming now is not like gaming then, and trends dictate that what might have been a pure action game or platformer in the ’90s and ’00s will inevitably have some sort of RPG framework attached to it. That’s not inherently the right or wrong choice. When it clicks, as it does with the Souls games, progression feels meaningful and enhances the gameplay without forcing players out of the action to spend hours in menus. When it doesn’t click, as with the recent Outriders, the RPG elements disrupt the pacing and ruin the more fun aspects of the game.Biomutant is another kind of experience. It’s not a game where disparate design elements are cohesively woven together to become more than the sum of its parts. It’s also not one where the RPG elements feel sloppily grafted onto an otherwise solid action game. It’s a game with a ton of ideas—many of them great—that seem only halfway realized.You start Biomutant by creating your nameless critter, which means picking both a breed and a class. Your breed supposedly determines what attributes you favor in the beginning: Vitality, Strength, Intellect, Charisma, Agility, and Luck. I say “supposedly” because, as far as I could tell, it really doesn’t make a difference what breed you pick, as you can customize any breed to favor any of the attributes you want. In the end, it only impacts what your character ends up looking like, though depending on what attribute you favor, two characters from the same breed might also end up looking completely different. High intellect characters, for instance, generally have scrawny bodies and big heads, while high Strength characters are exactly the opposite. Some players might not like having their character’s appearance tied to its attributes, but I felt an instant connection to my beady-eyed, long-necked freak.While it might look like Biomutant’s character creation system gives you a ton of options, there are really only two good options to start with: putting all your points into strength, or putting all your points into intellect. These are the two offensive-leaning attributes, and putting points into any of the other stats feels like a waste at the beginning. Going with a character that’s well-rounded will just leave you at a disadvantage, and favoring attributes like Charisma or Luck—which might work in a more detailed and nuanced RPG—is a complete waste in Biomutant, as the gear you procure throughout your journey is really only as good as the character who is wielding it.Class, meanwhile, determines what special skill and weapon you start with, and this too seems limited by what attributes you favor. A Psi-Freak, for instance, starts off with a unique Psi attack that throws out electrically charged balls, but the power of that attack is directly related to your Intellect, as is the amount of Psi energy you have and how quickly it recharges. Therefore, it would make no sense to have a high-Strength, low-Intellect Psi-Freak, although the game gives you that option. Other action RPGs might tie class to attributes so that you start with the tools that your character can use optimally, but Biomutant starts off with an uneven and clunky system that only works if you know what choices to make.These awkward choices matter less as you level up your character and unlock skills, but considering the maximum points you can start with in a single attribute is 100 and you only get 10 points for each level, it can definitely take you a while to create parity between your melee attacks and your Psi attacks. It also seems strange that there are three different methods of attack in the game—melee, Psi attacks, and ranged attacks with guns—but there isn’t really an attribute that impacts your character’s ranged damage.That might not be an issue in other action-RPGs, where your character class is more closely tied to your weapons and gameplay choices. But the combat in Biomutant isn’t slow, methodical, or punishing like Dark Souls. It’s much closer to the straightforward action of Devil May Cry, where mixing melee, Psi, and ranged is the core of the combat system. Biomutant is a game that, by its nature, encourages you to utilize all three attack types in the course of a single battle. When it works, it’s incredibly fun, but, when one method of attack is clearly more powerful than the others, the RPG elements get in the way of maximizing your enjoyment.But I must reiterate: When it does work, Biomutant’s combat is easily its strongest suit. This is mostly due to the amount of options you have at your disposal, between the different weapon types, gun types, and Psi and Biomutation abilities. Psi and Biomutation abilities both function as the game’s “magic” attacks, though Psi abilities are more traditional in that sense. Psi powers will let you damage enemies as you might expect. One lets you dash towards them and set the ground behind you on fire, which you can use to burn enemies. Another lets you shoot electricity out of your hands like Emperor Sheev Palpatine. My personal favorite was an ability that not only does a lot of AOE damage in an ice explosion but also freezes the ground around you so that enemies who try to attack will slip on the ice and hurtle forwards.Biomutation abilities are a little less traditional. One of my favorites was an ability that let you spawn mushrooms out of the ground. You can either use these mushrooms as a trampoline for yourself, in both combat and exploration, or you can bounce enemies into the air and follow up with a devastating combo attack. If you already have a mushroom on the ground and spawn another one underneath an enemy, they are launched into the air and stuck bouncing between the two fungi. Not every Biomutation ability is as inventive as that, but many of them are, and there is a ton of variety in the effects your abilities can have.The more traditional aspects of Biomutant’s combat are just as fun, due to the variety of weapon types and the control that players have over building these weapons. Almost all of Biomutant’s weapons, both ranged and melee, are made out of scrap that players find throughout the world. At any time, if they have the right scrap and enough resources, players can build and customize their weapons based on a handful of predetermined types.This weapon customization system is one place where Biomutant’s RPG systems feel fully realized, focused, and well-integrated into the rest of the game. Each type of weapon plays differently, as one might expect from an action RPG, but the combos that players can unleash to deal more devastating damage and build up the special attack meter all use the same button inputs. Depending on your taste, this might make Biomutant’s combat feel too simple, but it also means you can pick the weapon based on what type you prefer, rather than what combos are easiest to pull off.As well-realized as it is, there’s something that’s just slightly off about Biomutant’s combat. There’s a certain clunkiness to how battles play out. Partly, it has to do with the kind of visual feedback that you get. The way that the ranged cursor will soft-lock to characters you’re looking at can make it kind of hard to figure out which enemy in a group is the one you’re actually shooting. Same goes for the melee feedback. Sometimes, you will stagger enemies, but sometimes those same enemies will swing through your attack and hit you anyway. Other times, the timing on the game’s parry system—easily the game’s most overpowered combat mechanic—just doesn’t seem right, especially when the attacks you’re trying to parry (and which you should be able to, as indicated by wavy lines appearing over their heads) are coming from a larger mini-boss or as a series of parryable attacks. As with many of Biomutant’s features, even the game’s combat feels slightly wonky and undercooked.But the most wonky and undercooked aspects of Biomutant are easily its story and, even more so, its overarching open-world structure. Taking place an indeterminate amount of time after human society has caused its own toxic downfall and mutant creatures have spawned a new sort of civilization, your own mutant is a ronin warrior that has been traveling the land also for an indeterminate amount of time. After stumbling upon an amputee named Out-of-Date, you are tasked with destroying four monsters called Worldeaters that are chewing the roots of the Tree of Life, the source of all life that you helped plant as a kid.If that wasn’t enough, you’re also tasked with reunifying the world’s tribes who are all led by former disciples of your mother that split up when she died. Also, you have a slight amnesia and are piecing together the details of your past. Also, you’re trying to exact revenge on the monster who killed your parents. Oh, and did I mention there’s a UFO underneath the tree that’s going to take a few lucky inhabitants on a trip across the stars?There are a lot of story threads running through Biomutant, all of which could have provided enough motivation on their own to see the story through. But because there are so many, none of them really amount to anything.Take the Worldeater missions, for example. In order to defeat each of the four Worldeaters, you follow a similar trajectory: Meet up with one of Out-of-Date’s compatriots, help them build or retrieve a mount or vehicle required to reach the monster, and then fight the monster. But, while the overarching stakes of saving the world are high, there’s nothing to the story beyond that.It’s hard not to compare Biomutant’s structure to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, which gives you a similar task of traveling to the four corners of Hyrule to wrest back control of the Divine Beasts. The difference is, in that game, there was always a compelling story attached to that quest, where Link not only saved the world but readied the next generation of Champions, too. Biomutant’s main quest doesn’t have anything as personal or compelling as that. It’s simply a series of tasks leading to a boss fight, and that’s it.The game’s other main narrative focus—settling the tribe war—is just as undercooked. When you start a new game, you will have the option to side with one of two tribes and be tasked with conquering the other tribe’s outposts before taking down its leader or “Sifu.” You can stick with your tribe or side with a new tribe throughout the course of the game.The tribe war storyline has all the makings of an interesting RPG system, but the game doesn’t support interesting choices or even give you the kind of narrative carrot-on-a-stick that lends any weight to choosing one tribe over another. There are no emergent storylines that occur depending on which tribes you’re fighting for and against. There are barely any characters associated with each tribe besides the Sifus themselves. Even more bizarrely, at least in the first playthrough, you only have to conquer two rival tribes before the game gives you the option to make a peace deal with the remaining five. You can choose to keep fighting if you want, but if you decide to end the war right then and there, you won’t be able to earn the rest of the unique Tribal Weapons that you get when you conquer a tribe. But even more than that, this option to simply end the war makes the tribes feel completely meaningless. It’s as if the game is saying, “Yeah, none of this really matters; it was just an excuse to drag out the game’s playtime, but you can just skip it if you want.”Biomutant does absolutely nothing to make this conflict compelling on a narrative level. The only other thing that differentiates the tribes, besides their looks, are their Auras, which can be either Light or Dark. Which leads to Biomutant’s final RPG mechanic: a “morality” system represented as your character’s Aura. Depending on choices you make throughout the game, you can either have a Light Aura or a Dark Aura. Choose to help a villager rescue their friend, for example, and you will gain Light points. But if you choose to ignore their cries for help, you will earn a Dark Aura.Like everything else in Biomutant, the Aura system is half-baked. Instead of working on a sliding scale, making a Light or Dark decision will give you a point in that respective column. Some of the Psi powers require you having a specific amount of Light or Dark points, which makes sense in theory, but you don’t actually lose Light points for, say, making a Dark decision. It just tallies it up. So if you’re playing a mostly Light character, but you want to unlock a “Dark” Psi power, you can just go ahead and make a bunch of Dark decisions without losing any light points. This leads to a very uneven sense of your character’s progression throughout the game.The other problem with the Aura system is the choices you’re given. Making a Light decision when talking to an NPC in need means you’ll get a side quest that can usually lead you to decent loot and a healthy amount of XP. But if you decide to play it Dark, you don’t get an alternate version of that side quest. You just don’t get a quest at all—and, for some reason, you punch the character who was asking for your help. Going Dark, therefore, is a non-option if you want to see and experience everything that the game has to offer.The only place where you are actually impacting the story (because it’s the only place where there is an actual story) is the ending. Depending on which tribe you sided with and how you ended up resolving the war, you can either save the world or end it. But given how little connection I felt for the world because of how underdeveloped its inhabitants were, I couldn’t have cared less what happened to it in the end.More New Game+, More ProblemsSpeaking of endings, once I beat Biomutant the first time, I started a New Game+ to replay the game with my same character. In New Game+, instead of choosing to side with one of the game’s first two tribes offered, I was able to side with any one of the game’s seven total tribes. Which was great, except it feels like… that’s how the game should have been from the beginning?Even weirder was that, while I kept whatever gear I earned and skills I unlocked my first time through, all the attributes that I leveled up were reset to where they were when I first created your character. This also means that some of the weapons I built or found were unusable because I didn’t have the attributes I needed in order to wield them.An action-RPG completely stripping my level when starting a New Game+ is such a baffling choice that I had to contact the developer to see if this was an intentional design decision or a bug. I never heard back on that, though they did say that they are working on balancing the New Game+ experience.I’ve been using the words “undercooked” and “half-baked” throughout this review, but indulge me with just one more food metaphor: Biomutant is like a buffet. You have a bunch of food that you think you like—lasagna, sushi, chow mein, mashed potatoes—but they don’t go well together and, besides, they are worse versions of those items than what you could have gotten at a standard restaurant. I’m not saying you won’t have fun, but you won’t feel satisfied.Images: THQ Nordic GmbHBiomutant is trying to be too many things. It can be fun when you’re comboing supernatural abilities and homemade weaponry to take down a group of bad guys as a furry little post-apocalyptic ronin. But its RPG mechanics are so clunky and uneven, and its various story threads are so underdeveloped, that you’ll end up feeling like nothing you do actually matters. If you just want to explore yet another open-world and beat up some bad guys, then Biomutant will keep you busy for a few hours. Just be ready to encounter a slew of baffling and questionably executed design choices.Michael Goroff has written and edited for EGM since 2017. You can follow him on Twitter @gogogoroff.
