Link: Official site (opens in new tab)The Dark Souls series, including Demon's Souls and Bloodborne, were open worlds before the term referred to the structure of games like Grand Theft Auto and Assassin's Creed. Far off castles and swamps caught your eye, you puzzled out a linear path towards them, fell down a hole and went looking for a new destination. They didn't need maps or icons, because their worlds were dense with clues and lures leading to new paths and back to old locations.It worked, but spreading the mysteries and challenges of Dark Souls across an open world in the conventional sense—castles to infiltrate from many angles, swamps to ride through on horse, and beasts to chase you down—is the kind of thing you dream about.Elden Ring (opens in new tab), FromSoftware's successor to the Souls series, is huge in comparison to the previous games, and what's in its open world is undeniably Dark Souls.It was a little better as a dream, though. The real Elden Ring is so much like Dark Souls at times that it feels distracting: there's a woman who levels you up, there's a throne to usurp, and many of the same types of monsters you find in Souls games, including some that are almost entirely identical. Scattering those things around an open world, it turns out, doesn't improve them, and robs them of the significance they had in the other games.The Souls games are excellent, so despite reusing much of what we've seen before, it all works. Where Elden Ring retreads the past, it's like playing a new, remixed and remastered version of a Souls game—with some frustrating technical problems to really replicate those old times.  And when Elden Ring reaches for something more, it soars.Elden Ring's first few hours might remind you of gentler times in a game like Breath of the Wild, but no, FromSoftware has not abandoned its traditional brutality. Because of the open world, there are opportunities to circumvent some of the third-person, hack-and-slash fights that would eviscerate you in another Souls game, but it's still difficult—for me, one of the most difficult FromSoftware games.Elden Ring features the same deliberate combat that's now conventional for these types of games, except here it's fully refined. You swing, the enemy swings, and both of you can interrupt each other's attacks with acute timing. The best Elden Ring fights, like the best Souls fights, ask that you study the way an enemy lunges at you and look for openings to punish them when they miss. In action, it's almost turn-based as you make your move and wait for the enemy to make theirs. These games are compelling because it rarely feels like the enemies use a different ruleset than you, so when you find a way to eke out a win, whether it's through magic spells or explosive bombs, it's like you outsmarted a dungeon master. Elden Ring echoes some of the best fights in the series with towering bosses and groups of enemies that force you to make snap judgments about which to prioritize, but it also echoes some of the worst, giving its late-game enemies and bosses so much health that beating them can be laborious instead of fun.It's the scale of it that tricks you into thinking it's gentler at first. I spent hours prodding at the autumnal landscapes of Limgrave and Liurnia and didn't meaningfully raise my stats enough to withstand more than a swing from one of the two early major bosses. I defeated creatures on the surface and underneath the Lands Between, picked up useful items and gear, and upgraded my kit with the blacksmith, but none of that prepared me for Elden Ring's biggest threats. There are weapons and shields that confer unique powers, such as a shield that deflects magic back at enemies or a sword that flings out a blade projectile after a short charge up. They're all fun to play with while fighting weaker enemies out in the open world, but when it comes time to fight inside one of the game's ""Legacy"" dungeons, which are essentially Dark Souls levels set in castles and swamps, they don't often make a clear difference.This glacial progression makes some bosses, whether within one of Elden Ring's tough ""Legacy"" dungeons or out in the world, seem insurmountable without another player splitting the attention of the boss so that, for at least a moment, you can squeeze a hit in. Elden Ring remained hostile for the 60 hours I've put into it, making the trek through it occasionally frustrating and directionless. One pocket of land might house undead soldiers who fall to pieces with a poof of magic, while another one might contain ruthless giants who can shrug off an axe cleaved into their side. I spent much of Elden Ring unsure of how strong my character was and where I could go. It makes sense from my character's perspective—she's intruding on the land that exiled her—but for me,  inscrutable encounters with high-health enemies felt like hitting an MMO level gate, except that because this is a Souls game, I couldn't tell whether I was expected to spend hours mastering these fights or leave them until later. That's one of the reasons Dark Souls worked better with carefully crafted boundaries.Torrent, the horse you can summon almost any time while outside of Elden Ring's delineated dungeons and caves, is part of the problem, too. There are worse horses to ride in games (you don't have to feed this one and it rarely gets stuck on rocks or shrubs), but galloping past massive enemies or through camps to pluck an item up from the ground can be exhilarating, especially if you're dodging enemy arrows and swipes.Eventually (or early on if I was feeling more adventurous), I faced fortifications and enemy types that specifically punished my four-legged freedom with heat-seeking arrows and trebuchet barrages. In certain areas, this pushback prompts you to use Elden Ring's surprisingly useful stealth mechanic to approach buildings, but other times it's hard to read what it's trying to convey. Torrent, while theoretically an empowering way to move through Elden Ring, led to confusion on how I should tackle certain battles or enemy camps.Once you understand the language of Dark Souls, it's clear where you should head next in its more contained world and where you shouldn't. A poison-soaked area might drain your healing resources on an initial run, but a forest nearby is full of  herbs to stock up on. Elden Ring's problems often have similar solutions, but because the map is so big and dense, it was hours before I understood where I was supposed to use items like anti-poison herbs and armor built to withstand magic attacks that I found.Ruts like that are worth climbing out of to see Elden Ring's most tremendous moments. In its early hours, Dark Souls appears to be a typical fantasy setting with skeletons and dragons, but it eventually unfolds into an hourglass world where golden cities gaze down upon flooded ruins. When Elden Ring isn't recreating these locations, including that very same city down to the windows, or the poison swamp, or its own vacant version of the hub area, it's magnetic.Elden Ring could have been anything, and yet, for an absurd amount of its length, it's disappointingly interested in reprising the Souls games.Below the Lands Between lies one of the most beautiful areas in FromSoftware's oeuvre, rivaling the sakura-hues of Sekiro's final act. That's where I fought the Ancestor Spirit, a graceful, magical stag pulled from Norse mythology. In contrast to Elden Ring's grotesque dragons and stoic knights, the Ancestor Spirit is otherworldly as it weightlessly glides through the air. The fight is backed by a sparse score that drives the slow pace of the fight to give you the space to soak it up. FromSoftware games are known for difficulty, but one of the developer's greatest tricks is turning the tension on its head with a fight that's almost purely thematic, with just enough to do to keep you present. The Ancestor Spirit is like being deep into a rhythm game where the buttons melt away under your fingertips and the music alone carries you to the end. It's nigh-transcendent, and an example of how hard Elden Ring's best moments hit, when the iconography of the previous games disappears and FromSoftware's skill at orchestrating these types of battles shines through.The reheated boss fights from the previous games undercut the impact. Although many of them are remixed and situated in different contexts, they are all blatant nods to what came before. I fought a spinning wolf with a sword in its mouth like Dark Souls' Sif, I dueled a knight with the same gait as Artorias, and I barreled through a library of minions to disrupt a floating boss that resembles Fool's Idol from Demon's Souls. Dark Souls 2 and 3 were full of references to the previous games, but neither of them promised to be a whole new universe birthed in part from the mind of a famous fantasy author. Elden Ring could have been anything, and yet, for an absurd amount of its length, it's disappointingly interested in reprising the Souls games, even if doing so puts it above so many other action RPGs. The infamous Basilisks that spew a lethal toxin at you are back again, except now those basketball eyes that weren't actually eyes are actually eyes. FromSoftware has seen the memes and the love for its games, and Elden Ring basks in it.Elden Ring guide (opens in new tab): Conquer the Lands Between

Elden Ring map fragments (opens in new tab): Reveal the worldDemon's Souls and Dark Souls didn't birth an entire genre and its voracious fans by being full of things the developer had already done. They created the trend, and Elden Ring simply continues it by using many of the same parts as the previous games. Its open world is bold, but Sekiro's new enemy types, emphasis on one-on-one combat, and parrying diverge from the Souls trilogy. While Sekiro didn't end up being one of my favorite of FromSoftware's games, I deeply respect it for the ways it asked for a very different approach.Instead Elden Ring carries forward a lot of the things you'd expect, including rough performance on PC. Over time, it tends to intermittently stutter and slow down for brief moments, especially as you're out in the open world. I never died to a hiccup in performance, but it made me pause and restart the game fairly often to fix the issue.  (Bandai Namco claims the day one patch will fix this.) There's a 60 fps lock, high RAM requirement, and limited graphics settings (you won't find DLSS or granular options for anti-aliasing). I hoped for better options and performance from a developer that's released several games on PC at this point.Like with Dark Souls, though, Elden Ring's technical flaws are worth putting up with and will hopefully be fixed soon, either by modder or official patch. And when it stops clinging to the past so much and you plop off a cliff after being chased by wolves and find a swirling gate that takes you far outside the known map to meet a hunched over beast man, the idiomatic dream logic of Elden Ring reminds you that no other developer creates fantasy worlds this repeatedly transfixing.Elden Ring is junk food for FromSoftware fans. It's more of what I already adore, but family sized. It has everything that makes these games so intoxicating, and that lodges their intricate fiction into my brain. But its devotion to what came before is distracting. It dulls the impact of those moments where Elden Ring leaps beyond its past to demonstrate why FromSoftware's games are unparalleled by all who attempt to replicate them. As another Souls game, I love Elden Ring, but as the latest game from FromSoftware, I wanted it to dream a little bigger.Elden Ring reaches new heights, but spends too much time in familiar FromSoftware territory.Tyler has covered games, games culture, and hardware for over a decade before joining PC Gamer as Associate Editor.

Elden Ring,Aoife Wilson,Eurogamer,https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2022-02-23-elden-ring-review,"Die and knight cycle.At first, it's happening so slowly that you barely notice it. Out on the rolling, introductory fields of Limgrave, every encounter, no matter how small, is a risk - one that must be carefully weighted and considered before launching yourself into the fray.Every dank, echoing cave you step into could spell your doom, every seemingly sleepy ruin or settlement you pick your way through could be harbouring any number of twisted inhabitants seeking your cold, lonely end. Even out under the vast, open skies of these Lands Between you aren't safe. Your trusty steed Torrent might speed you from certain dangers, true, but even he isn't fleet-footed enough to outrun a tornado of dragonfire or a billowing cloud of poison spewed forth by a corrupted sentient flower. In this world, you start as nothing, no-one. But then, little by little, your power grows. The lowly bandits and wolves and soldiers you cut down turn to runes, these runes are channelled into power that steadies your sword hand, bolsters your spellcasting intellect, and enhances your ability to withstand a troll club full to the face. Bandits and wolves and soldiers turn to demons and witches and fey, and your power grows again. You feel you might be strong enough to journey south, to a ragged peninsula where beasts have overrun a castle by the sea; to the West, where lush marshlands have swallowed whole a once great centre for scholarly learning; to the East, where desert sands are stained red with blood and rot, or to the North, where a great golden capital lies, or perhaps you'll set off to a multitude of other faraway destinations between. As your power grows, so too does the challenge, and the wonder of the journey before you. Before long, you feel you just might be strong enough to challenge the demigods themselves.This is an ebb and a rhythm well-known to fans of From Software games by now. It's a song of life, death and a fading world of monstrous beings, with every refrain a challenge to get back up and try and die and try again. FromSoftware games - namely Demon Souls, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Sekiro - pride themselves on this particular genre of melancholic, masochistic action, and are in turn loved by fans for it - but they aren't known for being all that welcoming or accessible to new players. It's been clear for some time that with Elden Ring, the developer was hoping to satisfy core fans with ample challenge in a vast open world (the biggest the studio has ever undertaken), while courting potential new players with the promise of tools to help ease their passage through incredibly - and increasingly - unforgiving encounters. In this, Elden Ring is surprisingly successful. Veteran Soulslike fans will find stages set for epic showdowns set to test their resolve, while new players can call upon small and entirely optional devices that, while still demanding a certain level of skill before allowing you to carry on through the world, preserve the thrill without making you feel like you're repeatedly bashing your head against a brick wall. A lot of enemy encounters and even boss fights are made instantly more manageable with the simple inclusion of a distraction to buy you seconds of breathing room, and this part is played by new mechanic Spirit Summons, reusable items that spring forth echoes of beings to fight by your side until their death or the death of your enemy. Generally, their damage output will be laughable and they can only be summoned in certain areas. Thus, they aren't exactly there to hold your hand, but to buy you a few seconds of crucial time. Similarly, a mechanic whereby flasks of health and FP (your magic resource) are topped up after defeating an entire group of enemies can give you a helping hand when things get risky, but relying on this isn't without its own inherent dangers either. Then there are Stakes of Marika, where you can sometimes revive after death instead of a Site of Grace. It'll negate the sometimes lengthy and dangerous walk back to a boss battle, but you won't have the ability to change some of your set-up and loadout as you would at a Site of Grace. And utilising Great Runes, sources of great power found from felling some of the world's strongest beings, can be a huge boon when you need it the most, but again that doesn't come without a price. First, you need to activate the Great Rune, an obscure process on its own, and then you must choose to use an exceedingly rare, finite consumable item in order to tap into that power for as long as you stay alive. In true FromSoftware fashion, then, even when giving you the tools to move through the world a little easier, the underlying message is that nothing is free. Everything comes at a price, or with a tradeoff. For veteran fans, this is the experience you've come to expect from a Soulslike game, but the open world brings added thrills of discovery. It's clear that Hidetaka Miyazaki and co. delighted in the opportunity to create some truly stunning vistas - I gasped out loud at several extraordinarily beautiful landscape reveals - often showcasing From's trademark striking, haunting high fantasy with an incredibly subtle underpinning of dark humour. They may be huge and open but the Lands Between still feel meticulously hand-crafted; dark corners hide lonely secrets and forgotten tales richly woven into the tapestry of the world itself, through environmental storytelling, or an item description, or a single, seemingly throwaway line of NPC dialogue. You still get the structural ingenuity of Miyazaki's multi-layered world design in the tighter, more considered and more dangerous so-called legacy dungeons - self-contained areas that are set apart from the open world and hide its deadliest, most important foes. There are smaller dungeons out in the world as well, serving as warm-ups to the main boss encounters and making great practice for new players in particular, with their rewards generally consisting of a new weapon or an Ash of War to bolster your arsenal.Elden Ring's world is much more accessible in a literal sense as well - fast travel between discovered Sites of Grace, for instance, is unlocked very early on in the game and is almost always an option open to you, unless you're currently engaged in combat. At these Sites you can level up, enhance your healing flasks, set your spells and Great Runes and attend to those newly-earned Ashes of War - equippable weapon modifiers that can grant status effects like bleed, magic, or lightning damage to your weapon, while also granting it a special attack or effect mapped to the left trigger button. It's another way the gameplay has been subtly opened up. In previous From games these effects would have been permanently set to one weapon, but by allowing them to be freely switched around should the need arise From has given players the ability to more easily experiment and adapt as they go, so as to find a boss-winning strategy that could have otherwise been out of their reach without copious hours of grinding and upgrading. You may have noticed that I'm mostly steering clear of specifics when it comes to describing the world, boss encounters, sidequests or overarching story of Elden Ring. With good reason - this is the type of experience that benefits from you going in as unspoiled as possible. Fans can rest assured that you can find the usual mix of faux-Shakespearian tragedy, loveable if-odd bit characters and devious double-crossings, if you know where to look, but the world of Elden Ring is purposefully more alive than in other From Software games. The Lands Between are just tipping their prime, rather than existing in the throes of a full-scale, apocalyptic tailspin a la Lordran of Dark Souls. You'll meet a slightly more lively bunch of characters out in the world as a result - many of them more than once if you choose to follow their questlines. All that said, I'm also steering clear of specifics because I know that there's still so much left out there to discover, so much that will only become apparent post-launch. Even tackling later-game areas at level 50 and above still feels like barely scratching the surface of what the world has to offer, and in the tradition of From Software there are multiple endings to Elden Ring, with some perhaps requiring you to take some obscure steps, or even replays of the game, in order to achieve them.Whether Elden Ring successfully pulls in new players or not remains to be seen. The previously mentioned new mechanics may indeed make the game more accessible to newcomers, as does the enticing shift to a more open world structure, enabling you to simply nope out of a difficult battle, try your luck somewhere else and come back stronger and more prepared than before. That Soulslike games can't quite escape the reputation for challenge they've built for themselves is both a blessing and a curse - fans wear their dedication to these titles like a badge of honour, while potential players look on and may still feel uneasy about whether they'll be up to scratch, or if they'll even find enjoyment in FromSoft's particular brand of moreish torment. But, if there was ever a time and a particular game to get onboard with, it's now and it's Elden Ring. These experiences aren't for everyone, but this is the best and brightest (often literally) the series has ever been, and at launch new players will also have the added benefit of busy servers, meaning there will be plenty of other seasoned players to call upon in the game's co-operative multiplayer element if you're having trouble. ""Elden Ring remains a glorious game...""There are a few, small downsides. Elden Ring lacks a bit of polish here and there. On PS5, texture pop-ins are frequent and, pre-launch, we experienced a number of hard crashes to the console home screen. Gameplay-wise, not all new features are created equal. Torrent is a welcome way to explore the landscape from relative safety, for instance, but mounted combat can sometimes feel more awkward than epic, as you and enemies circle around one another in wide sweeps, swiping at the air and connecting with nothing for what feels like an embarrassing number of passes. Additionally, item crafting and resource collection feel like inclusions drawn from other games, rather than something that feels necessary here. Mileage may vary of course, and other character classes may benefit from it more than others, but for all the emphasis put on crafting by the proliferation of recipe cookbooks and ingredients I found out in the world, my spellsword Prisoner class barely ever had a need to make anything, with the exception of a couple of poison-staunching boluses. Melee or ranger classes needing ready access to arrows or thrown items might well feel differently, however. Also, in all honesty, George R.R Martin's heavy inclusion in the marketing for the game remains rather baffling; the exact nature of his contribution is unclear at best. One can only assume it was a collaboration designed to raise the game's profile in non-hardcore circles, but if there's one studio that needed no help in crafting an enticing dark fantasy game world, From Software is it, and George R.R Martin's cultural currency in 2022 is hardly enough to change the trajectory of Elden Ring's success on its own. All that said, Elden Ring remains a glorious game, one that established fans are going to savour for some time to come, and one that may just welcome new fans into the FromSoft fold. Sumptuous visual design, dark and detailed lore and a vast-but-intricate open world are reason enough to venture out into the Lands Between. Add to that FromSoftware's unforgiving and unforgettable gameplay loop and this is something truly special.

FromSoftware is my darling, as it is for so many people, and there's no game it's made since Demon Souls that I haven't played through at least twice (or much more). So bear in mind that these are the thoughts of a Soulsborne veteran, not a fresh-faced adventurer ready to experience his first taste of terror. And I'm a prisoner of that reality, leaving me horrified and fascinated by the idea that Elden Ring really could be the best FromSoftware game. Release date: February 25, 2022
Platform(s): PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC
Developer: FromSoftware Inc.
Publisher: Bandai NamcoEven saying it, I find it hard to believe - surely Dark Souls and Bloodborne can't actually be surpassed, right? Those games were bona fide masterpieces, and in the case of Dark Souls, era-defining masterpieces. You don't just improve on something like that, it doesn't make sense. It'd be like Beethoven waving away Ode to Joy as a rushed warm-up to the real thing. We're going to have to unpack this, and start at the beginning - which in Elden Ring's case, is definitely Torrent.Yes, it's an oversimplification to describe Elden Ring as ""Dark Souls meets Breath of the Wild"", but it's not totally inaccurate and works as a starting point for what we're dealing with here. And yes, the DNA of Dark Souls runs deep in Elden Ring, to the point where this could very plausibly have been Dark Souls 4. Even the title screens look the same.The Breath of the Wild element is all in the world design. Gone is FromSoftware's tangled spaghetti of interlinking paths, and now we have a wide, expansive continent, where rolling plains rise up to ominous mountain fortresses, or descend to… well, poison swamps, mainly. There's a fair few of those. So now you can go wandering in practically any direction and find something new to kill (or, more likely, be killed by).That's where the horse, Torrent, comes in. More than a simple gameplay gimmick, Torrent has to exist because the sheer scope of this world means walking was always going to be too slow. Consequently, a lot of threats are optional now. The first boss you encounter is a towering cavalry knight you're horribly under-leveled for, but then you realize you could always just… walk around him. Or go in the other direction. Or just power past on Torrent making insulting noises while he shakes his first in impotent rage! As a result, you rarely get into fights if you don't want to, at least out in the open. Torrent can outpace practically any threat and you can flee in any direction, so when six tons of scaly heartburn drops onto the road before you, you just scamper between its legs and vanish into the sunset like the goddamn Roadrunner. Sounds surprising, but this is the intentional experience - there are a lot of late-game threats spread across the world, even in the early areas, and a big part of how you play is deciding what you're going to confront and what you're going to slink away from until later. I suspect this is why people have been talking about Elden Ring being the most accessible, or even easiest FromSoftware game. I guess that's half true. It's not that Elden Ring is empirically easier - there are boss monsters here that could give Isshin Sword Saint or the Orphan of Kos a run for their money - it's just that the really punishing elements are basically self-inflicted. You deal with them when you choose. More accessible? Yeah, I'll give it that. Easier? Not so much.But as somebody very used to Dark Souls, I found myself getting into the combat groove quickly enough. It's the same scrappy, stamina-saving stabbing, staggering, and spell-slinging that we know and love, but with a few quality of life improvements, not to mention some bones thrown to those who are getting their feet wet for the first time (something I've no doubt will make the get-gudders sneer). Bows and arrows no longer suck, which was a nice surprise, weapon upgrades have been simplified a bit, tutorials are now items in your inventory you can check at any time, and there's the power to summon helpful NPCs by spending mana. Whenever I found myself getting mangled by goons, I could ring a little bell like a thirsty toff in Downton Abbey and have a manservant with a glaive come hurrying out of the spirit dimension to help. Between fights I found myself wandering the world, scooping up flowers, and enjoying the scenery, at least when it wasn't spitting horrors at me. There's a crafting element now - all the bits of bracken and bones you find while sightseeing can be combined in your menu to create consumables. It's a bit vestigial though; you don't start with many recipes so the instinct to craft things never really got hardwired into me. Still, it's not offensive. It occasionally served as a means to craft basic arrows, and it did lessen my fear about burning up limited items when I could always boil up some more from the parsley and demon offal stuffed down my underwear.Even if you're not going full survivalist, traipsing around the wild is a pleasure anyway. Elden Ring's setting - the Lands Between - has a singular vibe of its own, close to classic Miyazaki with added Norse and Arthurian storytelling stirred in. The life-giving world tree looming over you, the legion of heroic knights and their literal round table, the fallen gods seeking ascension, it's all very mythic in appearance and tone. But emotionally I'd say it's nearest to Sekiro, because this world isn't quite dead on the vine or locked in frantic madness yet. There's clearly some attempt by the rulers to keep order, it's just all been handled very ineptly. And this bleeds through into the world design nicely. Soldiers march the roads, keep checkpoints at key locations and even create magical jails that hold some optional boss fights. Where civilization and the wild make contact, you'll usually see some kind of brawl between knights and slavering monsters, barricades thrown up to keep out the worst nature has to offer. It's all part of the confusion that's clutching this world: nobody here seems to know who's in charge or why they really deserve it. As a result, your own Tarnished feels like an opportunist, using the uncertainty to grab what power they can while the chance is there.The world itself is suitably gorgeous. Each region has a clear visual theme that marks it out, but enhanced by creative design. The swamps and lakes to the West have eerie balloons floating over them, half-visible in the mist. The fiery wastelands couldn't just be singed rocks, they're overgrown with fat, tumorous growths that make it feel like the land itself is diseased. And a dragon the size of a skyscraper has crashed into the gods' golden capital, its body draped over the palatial architecture. Could a world by Miyazaki be anything other?And though the Lands Between is gruesome or solemn at times, it's also palpably full of life, giving it an optimistic energy no Soulsborne game has had so far. Sheep graze in the grasslands and scatter as a flock as you ride past, while elk flit through the forests and eagles give piercing stares from clifftops. Even the flowers glow with magical brilliance, little torches in the undergrowth that add color and light to your journey. And at any point, you might find a little crevice in a rock wall that leads to a vast underground city, monster lair, or bandit camp. The size of this game still staggers me now.But I'd say the design peaks in the monster variety and creation, which is pretty jaw-dropping. Even the standard enemies are some of the most bewildering, bewitching horrors I've seen. From the underground aquatic ant-wasps of the Ainsel River, to the cherub-winged hag-dogs of Castle Morne, to the scuttling ringed hand-spiders of Mt Gelmir… It's a little overwhelming. I could spend years building my FromSoftware Pokedex, and the bosses, as ever, are the moment Elden Ring ramps things up to eleven. The usual cabal of legendary warriors and unspeakable atrocities, they come crashing towards you with unbridled bombast, ferocity, and cinematic flourish, as well as an orchestral score that sounds like the world is ending 10 times over and refuses to let you feel anything but total, terrified awe.But let's address the few issues I have with Elden Ring - the visual design is superb, but the graphics themselves are a little bit unconvincing when seen close-up in cutscenes. There are moments where the openness of the world can make progress feel a bit aimless or uncertain, and much of the enemy AI could be outsmarted by a potato battery. At one point I was taking potshots at a legendary mage of great renown, but my character being partially concealed behind a door frame meant she struggled to work out why her head kept sprouting arrows, refusing to move even as I relocated several quivers' worth of ammunition into her brain.There's also an argument to be made that Elden Ring's not as revolutionary as it could've been. As fantastic as it is to have an open world Soulsborne, I wouldn't have minded Elden Ring carving out a little more of an identity for itself beyond being ""Dark Souls, but wider"". It's a small gripe though - being similar to a game I love isn't really much of a criticism, only that I'm ready for a little more of a jump next time.And it definitely doesn't detract from the overall experience. When Elden Ring hits the rails, the momentum carries it forward and refuses to slow down. My peaks of rage at being stomped on by towering titans never stopped being fun despite that, with that very particular form of masochistic joy you get from wrestling with FromSoftware games. It might not be as groundbreaking as its inspirations, but taken on its own terms, Elden Ring might be the best of its brethren - and that's something I'm still struggling to believe has actually happened.Reviewed on PS5 on a copy supplied by the publisher.Joel Franey is a writer, journalist, podcaster and raconteur with a Masters from Sussex University, none of which has actually equipped him for anything in real life.

Elden Ring,Daniel Tack,Game Informer,https://www.gameinformer.com/review/elden-ring/absolutely-astonishing-adventure,"Once in a great while, a game comes along that seamlessly combines impeccable gameplay, a wondrous world, incredible tone-setting music, and unparalleled art direction. That game is From Software’s Elden Ring, an action RPG that channels the best aspects of the studio’s last decade of work into one enormous package. This absurdly ambitious open world captivated my curiosity, enticed me with puzzles, secrets, and mysteries, and served up unbelievably satisfying moments as I experienced one of the most extraordinary adventures of all time. From my initial foray into the world to the final moments, every step of the journey is a note in a personalized epic that kept me coming back for more. This trek through dark and twisted fantasy is an endless exploration, continually serving up sensational sights that only get more enthralling and fantastic as the voyage goes on.The Lands Between is a world full of discovery, and while a clear path forward exists for those seeking guidance, roaming the lands unfettered without a particular goal in mind often yields surprises. I often had a spot to explore marked on my map and got off-track along the way, sometimes leading to entirely new areas and feature-dense zones. Elden Ring is not a theme park-style open world where each ride is bolstered by breadcrumbs so they won’t be missed – there are significant areas, bosses, dungeons, and other huge revelations that can be passed by, making these finds even more delightful. Even after over 55 hours, I know that I’ve missed plenty. Instead of pining over what I haven’t found, I’m inspired to keep exploring. The grandiose world is chock full of characters, quests, and various dungeon crawls ranging from tiny catacombs to massive multilayered tombs. While the journey starts with little caves, mines, and other dungeon delves, these experiences become more complex. Two-room affairs eventually become intricate teleport puzzles or scenarios where you discover unusual ways to interact with the environment, like learning to use traps for traversal or sniffing out secret walls. Even the most straightforward overworld dungeons house hidden boss rooms and treasures, in addition to their standard yields, rewarding the most inquisitive adventurers. Finding creative ways to travel to places that don’t appear accessible before the standard path guides you there feels remarkably refreshing, and more than one area delivers picturesque vistas upon arrival. Looking over a new area for the first time and realizing you can go everywhere you see is breathtaking and overwhelming. Some open-world locals, like churches, ruins, and Erdtrees, feel a bit familiar from realm to realm, but make no mistake there are numerous and unique points to explore and get lost in for hours. From mysterious castles to haunted magical grounds, the world is full of exciting diversions.  Your character is incredibly customizable, which I found highly rewarding. You can attach various skills and scaling mechanics across the board, allowing you to truly create your own vision of a traveling hero. Respecialization and alterations allow you to finely tweak your creation without worrying too much about experimentation along the way as you arm yourself with everything from explosive pots to potent perfumes to complement your ever-growing arsenal. Combat will vary greatly from player to player and build to build, but the precise dance of melee combat is more refined and diverse than ever. Featuring a behind-the-scenes stagger system that rewards players for taking chances with timing, the flow of battle makes the singular spammy strike a lesser choice in the face of a daunting foe.The open world is majestic, dripping with flavor and atmosphere, and full of fabulous finds. However, the legacy dungeons are the stuff of legend, often connecting to the outside from multiple points. These curated sprawls are a dream to dissect, and Elden Ring often offers different ways to maneuver through these areas. For instance, in one of these giant dungeons, I discovered a completely different way to “solve” the route to the final boss – and then went back and found a divergent path through another environment, leading to a wealth of battles, bosses, and loot. Sometimes, access to certain areas is in the last place you look, but the route to unearth it is laden with even more attractive paths to pursue.While some monster and boss designs are reused, the scope and scale of Elden Ring are enormous, which makes the repetition easy to ignore. I feel like I ran into around one hundred bosses in my playthrough. I’m not exaggerating. Some of these can feel commonplace and uninteresting, at the end of a small dungeon, like a repeat cave troll or magma drake, but the overall diversity of encounters meant that I never knew exactly what I was going up against at the end of any given expedition. I might run into a reskinned knight, but I might also go toe-to-toe against something truly astronomical. The big bosses, generally found at the end of legacy dungeons, feel like wonderful wars against demigods. These brilliant set piece battles are thrilling exclamation points to an outrageous odyssey, absolute spectacles, and masterful combinations of tension and triumph. Elden Ring has the distinction of having the best and most challenging boss battle in any From Software game to date. Hidden away and optional, this encounter had me waking up in the middle of the night to come back and crash against its beautiful and terrifying destruction over and over again. After finally besting this opponent, I let loose a triumphant victory roar there while sitting in the dark and wearing my pajamas, wanting nothing more than to experience the encounter again. This example speaks to how unbelievably compelling and immersive Elden Ring is; I regularly put it down with the intent of doing something else and found myself back within minutes. There is always one more gnawing mystery to unravel, one more boss to beat, and one more hidden route to find.Elden Ring challenged me, captivated me, and enchanted me, an unyielding deluge of discovery and artistic vision unbound. Elden Ring represents a truly amazing combination of various game elements that all come together to create something fascinating, special, and unforgettable. Elden Ring isn’t just the best game this year; it’s one of the best games ever made.

   on March 16, 2022 at 10:42AM PDTFifteen hours into Elden Ring, I defeated Godrick, the first of five Elden Lords. In the time between emerging into the Lands Between and striking him down, I'd discovered decrepit ruins, ventured into twisting caves, stumbled upon enemy encampments, and battled tooth and nail against challenging bosses. From Software's games have always made you feel small in many ways: They tell you that you're worthless--a plague-ridden rat or accursed Undead, unfit even to be cinders. They ask you to navigate unflinching brutal worlds and pit you against enemies that systematically dismantle your ego. Elden Ring maintains the nail-biting combat and air of mystery that has distinguished From Software's Soulsborne games, but it's elevated to new heights by the studio's interpretation of what an open-world game can be. Having brought down Godrick, the breadth of the world--and the way in which From Software has applied its signature style to an open world--was on full display, reinforcing how insignificant I really was and driving home the magnitude of the task that still awaited me.Standing on the edge of a cliffside in Liurnia of the Lakes, the area beyond Godrick's arena, I took in the world laid out in front of me: the enormous Erdtree casting brilliant golden beams of light onto the land that exists in its shadow; the sharp peaks of a distant mountain that look like claws tearing at the sky; a castle standing proudly amidst ruins; a forest blanketed in an ominous fog. It was all overwhelming, and none of the hardships I'd experienced in Demon's Souls, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, or Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice have come close to making me feel as small. At the same time, I was overcome with excitement for what the Lands Between had in store for me and all the seemingly insurmountable battles awaiting--and it did not disappoint.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

But what makes it special isn't just how visually stunning it all is, or that its open-world is vast, rich in detail, and teeming with possibilities. Instead, it's how the studio has applied its own esoteric design principles to deliver an experience that feels fresh, elegant, and uniquely From Software. The game's core pillars are built on the same strong action and role-playing foundations as previous titles while offering more freedom to explore than ever before. Elden Ring is an open-world game entirely in a category of its own. That delicate orchestration of highs and lows and the build-up and release of tension that From Software has mastered, coupled with the thrill of freeform exploration and discovery, is an intoxicating cocktail of game design.In guiding the player, Elden Ring employs the lightest of touches. The Lands Between is truly open and offers the player complete agency in exploration, whether on foot or horseback. The world is ruled by five Elden Lords, each in possession of a shard of the titular Elden Ring. As a lowly Tarnished, you aim to defeat these corrupt lords, take their shards, stand before the Erdtree, and become an Elden Lord in your own right. With the premise established through a quick cutscene, you are let loose and left to forge a path through the world as you see fit.A key part of From Software's design ethos is to strip down to the essentials, and in Elden Ring that process strengthens exploration and discovery, the heart and soul of the experience. The studio's games typically give the player very little while asking a lot, and Elden Ring is the most obtuse and demanding of its games so far. This is largely because everything you've come to expect from modern open-world games is absent; for instance, there's no map until you find an item that reveals the topography of a region. Even then, the points of interest in that region aren't marked until you've been there and seen them. There is no minimap, just a compass to show the cardinal directions and any waypoints you've placed.Characters, meanwhile, aren't desperate for your attention; as with previous games, the quests they task you with aren't noted down or tracked in any kind of log--it's up to you to do your due diligence. Areas you go to won't be gated depending on your level, and there's no clear indication on when you should go to key locations. The best you get is at the Sites of Grace, which function as rest points in the same way Bonfires, Lanterns, or Idols did in other titles. At each of these sites is a dim trail of golden light pointing in the general direction of… something. Perhaps it's the next milestone in your quest or maybe it's just another area that has a dungeon--the only way to find out is to make the journey.The challenge for From Software lies in the friction between the studio's design hallmarks and the expected conventions of a genre filled with games that try to be all things to everyone. And although the execution is an unmitigated success, one thing's for sure: Elden Ring is not a smooth-edged, one-size-fits-all kind of experience that will accommodate everyone. Instead, it's unrelentingly opaque, relishes in the savagery of confronting players with unfavorable odds, and delights in watching the ensuing struggle. Elden Ring's gameplay will feel familiar to those with experience of previous From Software games. The tried-and-true formula of measured third-person combat against enemies that are swift to punish foolhardiness is both as thrilling and nerve-racking as ever. Whether you wield a sword and shield, swing something that's closer to a heap of raw iron, or stand back as a mage and launch spells to topple your foes, Elden Ring tests patience and skill with tricky enemy mobs and ferocious bosses.From Software has added some new gameplay wrinkles to its Soulsborne formula this time around, most notably a jump, which has been pulled from the more dynamic movement style of Sekiro. This is useful not just for traversal but also for performing a leaping strike that can break through an enemy's defense and create a critical strike opportunity. Another new mechanic is the ability to strike back after blocking an enemy's attack with a heavy counter--dealing a good amount of damage and, if it's part of a sustained offense, could even leave the target open to a critical strike.This heavy counter has some of the satisfaction of Bloodborne's gunshot and visceral combo, though it's not as gratifyingly dramatic. While it's easy to rely on it, a great deal of strategy is still needed to perfectly execute it--an enemy's quick follow-up strike could cut you down before you've initiated the counter. The new gameplay mechanics certainly provide more options against tough foes, but they still require the player to know their opponent and carefully select their moments.The last major addition is Spirit Ashes, which allow the player to summon upgradable AI-controlled fighters to their side. These can range from a pack of wolves that aggressively pursue targets or a single mage that'll hang back and fire off spells, to stranger options such as a jellyfish that floats about and spews poison at foes. Of course, there are restrictions around summoning them, as Spirit Ashes can only be used in specific locations and only once per life. They're also susceptible to being killed by more powerful enemies, making them better equipped for pulling aggro than securing victories.These kinds of thoughtful tweaks extend to the checkpointing system, which is a little more lenient to accommodate the open nature of the game. Instead of being returned to a Site of Grace when killed, the open world is littered with small statues called Stakes of Marika. These can usually be found around particularly challenging areas, whether that's because there's a group of enemies in a fortified location or a singular mini-boss that must be faced in one of the many heart-pounding, soul-crushing, and utterly confidence-destroying encounters. This might sound like something that makes the game easier, and not having to fight your way through corridors and trap-filled dungeons like previous Soulsborne games certainly makes the repetition smoother and more approachable, but it's more of a necessity for taking out the frustration of having to travel large distances in an open world. The challenges the Stakes of Marika precede are no less forgiving.That delicate orchestration of highs and lows and the build-up and release of tension that From Software has mastered, coupled with the thrill of freeform exploration and discovery, is an intoxicating cocktail of game designElden Ring is undoubtedly difficult--much harder than any of From Software's previous games. And while a great deal of that is owed to challenging bosses and enemies, a significant amount is also because of the freedom the game offers the player. It doesn't tell you where to go in any way, so it can be very easy to find yourself in places that are too difficult for you to navigate. It won't stop you from riding to Caelid, a region that looks like it's ripped straight out of Bloodborne, or Caria Manor, a place with enemies so unsettling they made me leap out of my seat in a panic. Instead, it trusts you to assess the situation and consider your own capabilities both as a player and a character, then decide if you should return to a place that is more manageable and continue building your character up to come back later.Some, like me, will fall hopelessly in love with the thrill of blindly wandering into a corner of the map and being ruthlessly murdered for hours on end, just to walk away with little more than the satisfaction that I kept picking myself up and eventually emerged victorious, albeit battered and bruised. Others, however, will find the idea of navigating a perilous catacomb down to its deepest depths while braving all manner of horrifying creatures for a few measly crafting materials to be the epitome of unrewarding. But, either way, there's a boldness to the approach that deserves to be respected.The Lands Between is no less content-rich than many of its open-world contemporaries, and it offers much to do. In fact, it's an immensely large game that is bursting with activities to undertake--so much so that by the 35-hour mark, I had defeated just two of the five Elden Lords. In the starting area of Limgrave alone, there are numerous caves, tunnels, ruins, catacombs, shacks, and encampments to find. You may be wandering the woods at night and hear distant howls of what sounds like a man imitating a wolf, or step upon a mysterious lift that plunges deep below the surface and emerges into an entire kingdom buried underground. You could find a forlorn merchant, hiding out in a remote church, or accidentally walk into the territory of a rampaging dragon. These may not always lead to meaningful progress in becoming an Elden Lord or advancing a key questline, but none of it felt superfluous or boring. That is because what these activities offer is far more meaningful: a gameplay loop that sparks a curiosity to uncover the secrets that the Lands Between hold, and the raw satisfaction of discovery.Discovering things to do is as intensely satisfying as doing them, and that is what Elden Ring is predicated upon. The same sense of growth and satisfaction that comes from conquering Lordran or becoming completely at home in Yharnam is present as you brave the Lands Between. What once struck fear into your heart becomes trivial as you venture deeper and spend runes to level up and grow stronger. It should come as no surprise that a From Software game isn't quick to dish out rewards and praise for tasks you undertake. Instead, the most valuable rewards are intangible and internal: a sense of personal growth that comes from your mastery of mechanics and domination of the world's vicious denizens, or the feeling of journeying through this inhospitable land as a cartographer, poking into its various nooks and crannies, and seeing what lurks there.There are countless moments that will catch you off-guard and fuel that desire to explore. On one occasion, I traveled to a remote shack where a Warmaster had taken up residence. He had always been there, but this was my first time visiting at night. He wasn't in the shack, and when I approached it a cloud of red appeared and from within it a knight menacingly stepped out to do battle. He proceeded to wipe the floor with me, but considering he was telekinetically wielding a large spectral blade, I'd say he had a bit of an advantage.On another occasion, I mounted my spectral steed, Torrent, and bounded through an area I had been to numerous times, except this time a gargantuan baby bird that had rotted down to its skeleton descended from above, knocking me off my mount and cornering me in battle. In these moments, and many others like it, my mind raced with possibilities: With a world as vast as the Lands Between that shifts dramatically depending on the time of day, what else was out there for me to see? Elden Ring is a game where the possibilities feel endless and I felt driven to chase them all down, as each one has offered a memorable moment and made the world feel richer.Freeform exploration isn't completely new and the proverbial elephant in the room in that regard is The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. It's easy to draw comparisons between Elden Ring and Nintendo's acclaimed open-world Zelda, but what sets the two apart is a greater sense of authorship around the things you can stumble upon in the Lands Between and an overall cohesion between the open world and these activities. Elden Ring is seamless, whether you're delving into a cliffside cave or breaching a massive castle front, and in spite of the vast diversity among these locations. Although there are occasional breaks to make a transition, these are just for a few specific set-piece locations that are elaborate dungeons with ambitious design ideas--think of it as going from Hemwick Charnel Lane to Cainhurst Castle in Bloodborne.While the open world represents a newer Soulsborne gameplay experience that prioritizes freedom and player agency, there are also numerous key locations that are more in line with the enclosed, directed areas of previous games. Stormvale Castle, Redmane Castle, and Raya Lucaria, among others, are where From Software continues to do what it does best: create visually arresting locations that are intricately designed to loop and weave in on themselves in a way that makes navigating through them as joyous as it is perilous. Each of the key locations in the game has a distinct atmosphere, aesthetic, and vibe, and I found it impossible not to marvel at the craftsmanship on show. This is the kind of game where you have to stop to see the sights, even when the sights are grotesque creatures that make you worry about the minds that created them.There are areas of Elden Ring's world that feel as genuinely terrifying as Bloodborne, like the aforementioned Caelid, where the river runs the color of copper, fissures erupt like bursting arteries, trees are shriveled and curled like the hands of an ancient witch, and a blood-red sky stretches out as far as the eye can see. But hop on Torrent and ride west to Limgrave and you'll realize that Lands Between isn't entirely a world on the brink of collapse with life about to be snuffed out. It's very much alive, and that much is evident from the verdant fields, bustling wildlife, and picturesque vistas. If you're in the right place at the right time, you might even find yourself in a moment of serenity as the light of morning dawn sweeps over a forest and the trees gently sway in the wind. The most impressive part of it all is how it coalesces in a single landmass that the player can travel across, despite the fact that each area looks and feels like it could be from an entirely different game. Needless to say, Elden Ring is a gorgeous game and a spectacular feast for the eyes.Much has been made of George R.R. Martin's involvement, but there's little in Elden Ring that stands out as having his fingerprints on it. From the characters to the narrative and the way it's delivered in broken pieces for the player to fill in the gaps, it's unmistakably Hidetaka Miyazaki and the From Software team--and it's all fascinating. To talk about it would be to deprive you and the larger Soulsborne community of one of the greatest joys of a new From Software game, so I won't do that, but it's safe to say that the expansive world, which Martin helped lay the foundation for, is filled with memorable characters. Some have mysterious motivations, while others have tragic fates and somber backstories. There are clashing ideologies, divine entities, and clandestine groups vying for power--all the pieces, and item descriptions, needed to supercharge the From Software lore video industrial complex are here. I have just a small grasp of everything going on, and I cannot wait for the larger community to get involved so we can piece it all together as a collective.While there is a unique kind of joy to be gained from carving a path through the Lands Between as a solitary adventurer, Elden Ring can also be played cooperatively. Like previous From Software games, the process of connecting with others is not as smooth as you might expect from a modern-day game, requiring players to jump through hoops such as being positioned in specific ways, using specific items to establish connections, and sticking to certain areas. It is undoubtedly convoluted, but when it works, it leads to some of the most memorable multiplayer experiences you can have, whether that's simply adventuring out in the world or summoning in someone to help defeat a challenging boss. The same sense of achievement derived from taking down a powerful foe is there when you team up with another person, as difficulty scales to account for multiple combatants, so it still feels like you're earning a victory.On the other hand, if you want to play the role of antagonist, you can invade other players' worlds and attempt to assassinate them. Souls games aren't often the first thing that come to mind when thinking of PvP experiences, but they have been the battlegrounds for thrilling brawls for some time now, and Elden Ring continues this tradition. The magic is in the fact that the game accommodates diverse builds, so you never quite know what weapon, armor, or ability an opponent may pull out. Fights are tense ballets of strafing, rolling, and striking that feel akin to a fighting game, and when you throw the game's remarkable vistas and punishing enemies into the mix, it can make for some truly memorable scenarios.In a genre that has become wrought with bloated and over-designed games, Elden Ring is defiantly contrarian in almost every way. Its commitment to design by subtraction and to placing the responsibility of charting a path through its world entirely on the player makes it stand head and shoulders above other open-world titles. Elden Ring takes the shards of what came before and forges them into something that will go down in history as one of the all-time greats: a triumph in design and creativity, and an open-world game that distinguishes itself for what it doesn't do as much as what it does.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"
Elden Ring,Michael McWhertor,Polygon,https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22947204/elden-ring-review-from-software,"Filed under:The open-world Dark Souls successor is staggering in breadth and challengeDemon’s Souls and Dark Souls game director Hidetaka Miyazaki has not taken comparisons of those games to The Legend of Zelda series with much joy. “I feel deeply unworthy of the comparison,” Miyazaki has said, calling the early Zelda games “monumental” works. But it is hard not to see the Zelda series’ influence, particularly the groundbreaking open-world adventure The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, on his company FromSoftware’s new game, Elden Ring.Nintendo’s 2017 Zelda game appears to have had a powerful, and overwhelmingly positive, impact on FromSoftware’s beloved style of action-RPG. Elden Ring is a deeply impressive adventure of incredible breadth and depth, blending From’s style of rich, challenging combat with exploration, discovery, and new levels of player freedom.Polygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences.

If you want curated lists of our favorite media, check out What to Play and What to Watch.It starts with the Tree Sentinel. This meaty, golden warrior sitting astride a powerful steed is the first thing you encounter in Elden Ring’s vast fantasy world, the Lands Between. He’s nigh-impossible to defeat in your weak starting state. But just behind him is a church in which to find refuge and supplies, and a bit farther, a castle to explore. Around you are woods with abundant natural resources, with which you can craft curative items. Elden Ring communicates quickly that your means of survival require exploration, learning, growth, and returning to face challenges, like the Tree Sentinel, when you’re physically and mentally ready for them.Anyone who’s ever faced down a Lynel in Breath of the Wild will know that process.Elden Ring is a clear continuation of Miyazaki’s Souls series, and it hits many of the same notes: A quiet, blank-slate warrior travels to a far-off, blighted land, where man and beast alike are cursed by some awesome power and cataclysmic event. And while Elden Ring starts its conversation with the player in ways familiar to anyone who’s played those renowned games, the conversation quickly changes only minutes into the game.The game’s massive map — and yes, there is an honest-to-goodness on-screen map this time — is only barely revealed to you at the beginning. But as you explore, on foot and on horseback, you find enemy encampments, castles, dungeons, catacombs, caravans of warriors, and the occasional friendly face. Every discovery in the world helps you grow stronger, either through experience or material rewards. In an easily accessible catacomb tucked away on a nearby cliffside, for instance, I discover an equippable talisman that restores precious health points when I land critical hits. In an enemy camp, I find a better shield that fully absorbs enemies’ strikes. At glowing saplings, I find Golden Seeds that add extra charges to my healing flasks. Every new power I discover makes taking on the next challenge a tiny bit easier.Many challenges in Elden Ring are monumentally difficult. Take Margit the Fell Omen, a twisted, stocky, stick-wielding warrior who appears to be in the painful process of becoming a tree. Facing him alone in the early hours of Elden Ring feels all but impossible. However, I can now summon a trio of ghostly wolves to aid me in battle, and enlist a powerful warrior in spirit form to fight alongside me. Neither makes Margit a cakewalk; boss battles in FromSoftware games are notoriously difficult — and Margit’s immediate successor is even more challenging — but Elden Ring gives me myriad tools to make myself just a bit more capable in tense situations. I can also visit a hub area, geographically unmoored from the Lands Between, called the Roundtable Hold, to strengthen my weapons of war even more. Forty-five hours into Elden Ring, I’ve defeated three of the game’s major bosses. They’ve granted me powerful runes, which I can temporarily use to empower my character. I also have a broad arsenal of weapons — swords, pikes, clubs, bows, even a rusted anchor — and magic at my disposal. I have learned healing spells and pyromancies. I can concoct deadly perfumes to poison my enemies. I can summon forth a ghostly jellyfish or a snakeman to fight for me. I can cook unsavory dishes made from mushrooms, animal livers, and wild fruits, which cure ailments or confer a temporary buff. Elden Ring’s toolset for growing more capable against daunting odds is deep and impressively varied — but it has not made me a god.Which is to say that FromSoftware’s signature high level of challenge remains intact in Elden Ring. Just as From has given me a deep well of tools I can use to tailor my play style, it has also compensated by deploying some of the hardest, most frustrating enemies it’s ever created. But I have found respite riding my steed Torrent through the game’s open-world areas, discovering caves and catacombs and wrecked little towns where I find even more tools with which to arm myself. I just learned how to summon a disembodied fire-breathing dragon head at the end of my arm, for example. And that feels great.The Lands Between is dotted with destinations both big and small. There are huge, mazelike castles to explore, yes, but there are also underground tunnels and mines where I can farm for materials and battle unique bosses of lesser difficulty. I’m measurably improving in the in-between moments before harder and harder boss battles. There is wonderful variety in the Lands Between, ranging from towering medieval fortresses to putrid, poison-flooded forts, from gorgeous autumnal landscapes to caverns carpeted with skinned corpses. One area of the game, a rotten, red-skied land called Caelid, is so grim and unsettling that merely existing in it felt exhausting. FromSoftware has raised the bar, once again, for miserable fantasy worlds.The Lands Between can be bleak to the point of depressing, but it can also be magical. Take, for instance, the mysterious four-legged walking cathedrals that clomp through plains and shallow lakes, ringing their bells for a purpose I have yet to discover. Like many oddities in Elden Ring’s vast world, these beings also represent a puzzle to solve — and should these self-contained tiny mysteries become too perplexing, there is often a merchant or helpful resident nearby who can sell me a clue. These people will also sometimes sell me recipes from which to craft new items, or offer a task to undertake for a reward. There are massive dragons, towering golems, and large sentient pots out in the open world, to be sure — but the smaller details work wonders. They feel less like crossing off a checklist, and more like new brushes of color for this impressively realized world.Elden Ring eschews traditional open-world video game bloat. There are no strict directives about where to go and what to do — merely suggestions and guidance from the Light of Grace at places of rest. Rarely will any character I meet in the world put a mission on my map or issue a demand. Instead, I fill in the details, discovering the castles and keeps for myself, marking new destinations and points of interest. Elden Ring encourages me to get lost and to make new discoveries on my own.The open world of the Lands Between is only lightly gated by progress. On Torrent’s back, I can go just about anywhere, anytime. And by using Sites of Grace —  Elden Ring’s version of Dark Souls bonfires — I can quickly move around the game’s continent in mere seconds.This movement is also shockingly convenient. Anytime I need to stock up on arrows or spend my current bank of Runes on a spell I might think I need, I simply pull up my map and teleport to my desired location. Likewise, anytime I find myself stuck on a particular problem — let’s say, for example, a damnable knight who can telekinetically throw his sword at me from across the room — I go do something else. There’s always something else to do.Elden Ring’s story is, like many FromSoftware games, opaque, and often tangential to the immediate action. Fantasy author George R.R. Martin, who contributed to the game’s lore, has done little to alter how From tells a story. It still comes across in short conversations, item descriptions, and in the very landscape itself. Almost everywhere you go is in some state of ruin; churches are destroyed, castles have been crumbled, and only the most powerful survivors thrive here. Martin does appear to have given Elden Ring a more grounded fictional basis in terms of familial relationships, a lust for power, and how the influence of that power has tremendous repercussions for the people they rule. But it’s hard to gauge the real impact of Martin’s contributions here, particularly since I have yet to finish the story, or stitch together its piecemeal lore. While the characters I’ve met in Elden Ring are more verbose than in past FromSoftware games, this is not a straightforward tale. Much of which is to say that if you’re coming to Elden Ring for Game of Thrones-style drama — a vast fantasy epic spread across a similarly vast open world — you will not be served that. Instead, you’ll get whispers of a wider narrative and a mostly clear mission: Slay everyone and become the Elden Lord yourself.Elden Ring is the natural next step for FromSoftware, which last delivered a huge fantasy world like this in Dark Souls 3. That game featured a sprawling, interconnected world, a vast armory, and an incredible amount to learn, wield, and discover. Elden Ring is that game amplified — it plucks the best from Bloodborne, with its compact, puzzlelike mini-dungeons, and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, which offered new levels of mobility and faster action.But, all told, FromSoftware has done more than just remix its earlier games and layer on open-world influence with Elden Ring. The studio’s conversation with the player goes in fascinating new directions, and there are great surprises here for longtime fans of Souls games; From clearly knows what we expect of its castles, its boss encounters, and the random out-of-nowhere ambushes, and it plays with those expectations. Sometimes it means I die unexpectedly. And sometimes it makes me smile. Elden Ring will be released Feb. 25 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.

Elden Ring,Ian Walker,Kotaku,https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-fromsoftware-review-hidetaka-miyazaki-dark-s-1848694257,"I spend too much time, at least for someone with only 33 years on his odometer, thinking about legacy. I find myself overly concerned with what I’ve accomplished and what I’ll leave behind, especially in comparison to other people—both successful and otherwise. As such, while playing FromSoftware’s Elden Ring over the last month, I couldn’t help but pore over studio president Hidetaka Miyazaki’s biography, if only to feel a little worse about myself.Miyazaki started his career in game development relatively late. But by the time he was 33, he was already working as director on Demon’s Souls, the PlayStation 3 classic that created the oft-imitated Souls-like pseudo-genre as an enduring facet of gaming history. Since then, Miyazaki’s established himself as the creative genius behind FromSoftware’s biggest projects, including Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and now Elden Ring, which released for every major gaming console (apart from Switch, which can’t typically handle such vast games) on February 25. I’ve since spent more than 90 hours journeying through Miyazaki’s sub-conscious, and let me tell you, it can be a pretty weird place.Elden Ring is an inevitable climax in Miyazaki’s legacy. It’s this massive, sprawling thing that borrows from, quite literally, every FromSoftware project that came before it. The game is (and I’m sorry in advance for saying so) Dark Souls meets Breath of the Wild. I barely know where I’m going or what I’m doing half the time, but the experience isn’t so unwieldy that it overwhelms with its many options and systems. Elden Ring mostly stays out of its own way, giving you the gentle nudges in the direction of cool stuff while also providing little resistance should you choose to forge your own path, a complete package neatly wrapped in the expected ambiguity of traditional FromSoftware design.I’ve long since made peace with the fact that reviewing Elden Ring—that is, providing an adequately thorough accounting of my time with the game—is nigh impossible, at least with my limited skillset. How do I make you feel the way I felt every time I encountered a merchant or enemy creating the most mournful diegetic music I’ve ever heard in a video game? What words can I use to bestow the same soothing nostalgia that rushed over me the first time I hit a wall with my weapon and it finally faded away to reveal a hidden path? How do I spell out the perfect onomatopoeia to capture my reflexive groan when I was ambushed by a nest of smoke-spewing basilisks, immediately aware of their dangers from encounters in previous Souls games?Everything in Elden Ring comes bundled with its own kind of friction, designed to rub you the wrong way until, finally, it rubs you the right way. And those rough edges cannot be sandpapered down without fundamentally changing the game’s entire raison d’être. Souls fans often make hay over the feeling of accomplishment that comes from overcoming the genre’s much-vaunted challenges, but it’s more than that. It’s like when my dad recently greased the hinges of an old screen door in my childhood home. The first time I opened it following his turn as a handyman, I fumbled with a brief weightlessness when I wasn’t greeted by the exact sound and sensation I expected. I heard nothing. I felt nothing. It was like I was in a void. All the texture, all the personality that door previously clutched in its creaking joints was gone, replaced by a whispery smoothness that hid its existence rather than adding flavor to the world.That’s Elden Ring without the learning curve, a process that sees FromSoftware essentially throw players into the deep end and encourage them to swim for safety. Could the user interface be a little more descriptive? I suppose so. Could the devs make a concerted effort to further evolve the combat mechanics past the clunkiness of its predecessors? Sure, anything is possible. But personally, I don’t want a game that plays like every other game—it helps that I get a perverse amount of satisfaction from Elden Ring’s repetitive die-retry-die loop, of course—and it’s refreshing to see FromSoftware stubbornly maintain its decades-old conventions. Akin to a project that eschews modern sensibilities like high-definition graphics and smoother frame rates to achieve a specific aesthetic, Elden Ring wouldn’t be such a worthy successor to the Souls lineage if it didn’t kindly ask players to modulate themselves to its eccentricities rather than the other way around.Mind you, Elden Ring isn’t the monster it and its predecessors are made out to be by diehards and detractors alike. The new, open-world structure feels like an intentional decision by FromSoftware to extend a fig leaf to folks who bounced off other Souls games, many of which were far more linear experiences than Elden Ring. Getting stuck on a boss in Dark Souls or Bloodborne, for instance, often meant slamming into the same brick wall over and over again until finally busting through bloody and bruised, whereas the Lands Between provide much more to see and do. Dozens of hours can be spent exploring the regions before the first major dungeon and its skill check of a boss, gathering loot and gaining levels until you’re overpowered enough to reduce Godrick the Grafted to a pile of amputated limbs with little effort. You can even skip the fortress entirely if you’ve decided you’ve had enough of his nonsense, a viable strategy for when you want to see what the rest of the game has to offer.At its heart, the beauty of Elden Ring is found not in its difficulty but the little things you do between the earth-shattering boss battles. It’s about exploring every shadow-filled nook and fog-obscured cranny of the environment in search of items you’ll never use. It’s about spinning the camera just right to peek around corners and over precipitous ledges for hidden dangers. It’s about clambering into coffins that deliver you up and over underground waterfalls to caverns long forgotten by time and inhabited by eldritch creatures from beyond the stars. It’s about scaling the crags of a dead, impossibly massive dragon or the giant offshoots of a golden tree, both of which have so integrated themselves to the structures of a decaying capital city that, for centuries before your arrival, they’ve become more architecture than biology.Elden Ring manages to pull off the miraculous feat of making you feel small yet still able to affect tectonic shifts on the world around you.As one of the Tarnished, a group of “chosen” “undead” returning to a mythical world known as the Lands Between long after an unexplained exile, Elden Ring puts you in the position of both visitor and vaccine. The shattering of the eponymous phenomenon known as the Elden Ring resulted in the deaths of demi-gods and the dissolution of great kingdoms, leaving a huge mess for you to set right in various ways upon your arrival. Like the more desolate settings of previous Souls games, the Lands Between is a shadow of its former self, and the miserable few that remain to pick through the rubble seem to do so out of a sense of momentum rather than a concerted effort to put the pieces back together. Life doesn’t find a way to endure in Elden Ring so much as it limps forward with its eyes glued to the ground, unable to cope with the end of the world.The best way I can describe exploring a Souls game like Elden Ring is to compare it to buying or renting a used role-playing game in the era of the cartridge. Back before progress was saved on consoles, memory cards, or magical cloud servers, playing a previously owned game meant coming face-to-face with someone else’s history. And while this mostly resulted in a few boring minutes spent wiping the cartridge’s internal memory, sometimes it provided you with the perfect opportunity to experience the end of the adventure before taking your own first steps. After paying way too much for a boxless copy of Super Mario RPG as a kid, for instance, exploring a completed save and seeing how characters reacted to the final boss’ defeat was like visiting a museum in an alternate dimension. The Mushroom Kingdom had moved on and I was merely a tourist wrapped in the digital skin of someone they used to know.""Great things happen when George R. R. Martin finishes a project.""Open-world Souls-likeRidiculous freedom, solid combat, incredible characters and storylines, mind-bending lore. It's a Souls game, folks.Frequently reused bosses, no photo mode, creativity seemed to sputter out near the end.FromSoftwarePlayStation 4, PlayStation 5 (played), Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PCFebruary 25, 202290+ hours to complete most side quests en route to the ending.This extends past story and setting into gameplay as well. Where a fresh save file in most games may beset you with tutorial pop-up after tutorial pop-up to slowly acclimate you to its challenges, Elden Ring’s lived-in world largely treats you like you’ve been here before. Sure, there’s an easily missed primer that teaches you the basics, but for the most part, it’s up to you to learn the game’s unique visual language.Swirling airborne flecks of gold sparkles indicate the presence of semi-hidden checkpoints. Statues of hunched-over old men point the way towards catacomb-like dungeons. Magically animated rock piles mean an alternate dimension prison cell containing a mini-boss is somewhere nearby. Elden Ring does this so effortlessly and at such a microscopic scale that you’ll recognize yourself recognizing the telegraphed body language of even the least dangerous enemies and formulating counters without an inkling of when exactly you gleaned that info.Other critics have described Elden Ring as slapstick, a sort of Arthurian legend meets Looney Tunes situation that births increasingly hilarious moments despite the game’s serious trappings. And much like allowing your brain to take a breather while you laugh at Johnny Knoxville getting kicked in the nuts, giving yourself permission to adopt the right mindset is the first step to truly appreciating what Elden Ring offers.Accept that the game won’t always play fair. Accept that its huge input buffer will more than once make you take a swig of a healing potion when you really meant to dodge. Accept that you’ll probably get your ass kicked the minute you step outside the starting area because you, wearing only a loincloth and wielding a small club, dared to take on the swole mounted knight in the gloriously gleaming armor. Accept Elden Ring for what it is, for what FromSoftware set out to accomplish, and don’t get hung up on what it’s not. I promise that 90 percent of you will have a much better time with the game if you do. And for the other 10 percent, well, that’s okay too.I say this compassionately and without an ounce of elitism in my heart: A work of art isn’t always meant for everyone.Elden Ring is a love letter that may as well be written in a dead language for those unable or unwilling to bend themselves to its will. While certainly not as inscrutable as King’s Field, unforgiving as Dark Souls, or mechanically complex as Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, the latest FromSoftware project still asks players to put up with a lot of frustration. But if they do, what they’ll find in Elden Ring is a fitting culmination to director Hidetaka Miyazaki’s decades of world-building expertise. My lengthy sabbatical in the Lands Between revealed to me a game that was as much in love with giving you something new and weird to see around every corner of its massive open world as it is with the sound of its own voice. Seriously, sentient iron balls? Giant hand monsters? A necrophiliac named Dung Eater? FromSoftware needs to chill.Like most great works, Elden Ring is magnificently flawed, equal parts beautiful and ostentatious. In this age of cookie-cutter, paint-by-numbers, triple-A development, what more can you ask for than something wholly confident in its bullshit? Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m only about one-third of the way through the game and would love to see at least one of its multiple endings sometime this year. "
Elden Ring,Chris Carter,Destructoid,https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-elden-ring/,"darkIt’s time for another From Software game! Gather around as we talk about Elden Ring, which needs no introduction.I’ll get this out of the way: Elden Ring is possibly my favorite From Software game yet. I’m going to have to simmer on this (I’m on my second playthrough now) for years to come, but it’s looking really good based on a full completion and change. Let’s dig into this monstrous adventure.Elden Ring (PC, PS4, PS5 [reviewed], Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S]
Developer: From Software
Publisher: Bandai Namco
Released: February 25, 2022
MSRP: $59.99One of the biggest selling points of Elden Ring is that it has an actually engaging open world. So many open games have become bloated messes, mere parodies of the genre, in recent years. Pins upon pins upon pins, with tie-ins and companion apps; it’s ridiculous in some cases. But Elden Ring feels fully complete, in the sense that discovery is paramount before reaching marked destinations for small dopamine hits. I constantly found myself looking off in the distance, and becoming fixed with finding out how to get somewhere. The EldenSekiSoulsBorne (coined!) spirit is alive and well.Dead bodies in ornate chairs and the hubris of royalty is still a mood: and a unique one in the landscape of games. While the story is still very low key at times, I enjoyed the effort to pack in more lore via textual ruins, as it’s way easier to piece things together that are actually in the game, and not in an interview or wiki. I honestly couldn’t tell you which parts feel like they were touched by George R. R. Martin, but having read through all of the Game of Thrones book series, that’s fine with me. Miyazaki and company have been doing just fine on their own so far, and Elden Ring continues that trend.It’s also true to form in other ways. Small caves leading to big areas is a big part of Elden Ring‘s DNA: caves you may miss entirely on your first playthrough. But there are also super obvious landmarks to visit in an organic way by simply coming across them. As you start to weave together routes, locations of secret merchants, and far away points of interest, the game really comes alive. Running into a convoy of enemies and figuring out how (or where) to approach them is a unique thrill that’s inherent to From Software games, but feels bigger in scope because of the fabric in which Elden Ring is comprised.The series has undergone some changes, mostly for the better, in the quality-of-life department. At one point I had wandered around the map for a while without checking the navigation screen, stumbled into a tomb, got ambushed, and died. When I was prompted to resurrect, I had the option to head to a checkpoint called a Stake of Marika (presumably near that tomb), or the last site of grace [bonfire]. I chose the former, found myself very close to my body, and got my runes [souls in other games; currency you use to level up or buy things] back I had lost. Some may call parts of Elden Ring “easier” on paper, but I just see it as convenient.It doesn’t feel easier, at least. The “marking where you need to go” bread crumb mechanic, which was announced around when the game was revealed, isn’t even that descriptive. While NPCs do give you vague hints of what area to go to and glowing arrows point to places of interest, not all of them are going to be story/critical path locations. On one occasion, I spent a few hours trekking through an area with a marker that turned out to be completely optional.Because the game is so big, and things can feel so aimless, adding a convenient mount on top of the other quality-of-life features is a genius move, because Elden Ring wouldn’t work nearly as well if it was more rigid. Instant fast travel is a Godsend, especially for quests that ask you to immediately about-face and head back down the same path you just ran through. Testing it out on a PS5 made this process even smoother, as loads were near-instant. The technical and design advancements actively encourage more exploration without the contrivances. The Stakes of Marika, which function as little “checkpoint” fires for (many, but not all) boss fights make repeat attempts more fun/quicker too.Galloping around on a horse and jumping are two small things that I take for granted in a lot of other games, but here, they’re even more appreciated. It’s really addicting, meandering about the map, and trying to jump up to get a better view of everything. Again, it’s all organic. When exploring, I would often use higher ground to find a legitimately cool-looking or interesting area, mark it on the map, then go to it. It’s not too gamey or cynical. No joke, I spent hours roaming around in between “story bosses.” And you know what? It even has a low key marker/stamp system to draw in your own personal map: and I didn’t even find the option to trigger stamps until my second playthrough (just the light-ray objective markers, which are limited).The map is far bigger than expected, going beyond the limits of what the screen shows you at first. You’re constantly coming across new stuff, because exploration is so expansive. So there are some gates (think keys you need to get into specific areas), but by and large you can explore nearly the entire map. Finishing a “story” boss will lead you to the next area by default, or you can sometimes sneak there using a hidden path and sequence break (to a point). If you’re worried about a lack of “traditional” areas: don’t be. There are plenty of massive, deliberate zones just like the old games. That said, some of the open world stuff isn’t as exciting as I’d like.Micro-dungeons can get derivative, much like the Chalice layouts in Bloodborne. There’s tiers of said dungeons, from “ruins” (which are glorified treasure chests), to dungeons (think chalice), to caves (usually with weapon-enhancing materials), and so on. Some of them are a cut above and more clever with unique layouts and puzzles, but those are typically found near the end of the game. There is, however, a very cool take on subterranean map design (that I won’t spoil here) that makes up for it.When I was at the foot of the final boss, I went back and found 15 hours of more stuff to do, and didn’t exhaust it all. The “40-hours-or-more” mark for a first playthrough is roughly what a lot of people are looking at, erring on the side of “more.” In fact, on my second playthrough, I found at least 10 things I hadn’t done before in the first five hours of that next go-around. The scope should encourage multiple playthroughs more than any past From Software title.And yet, the open world changes nothing in terms of the heart and soul of Elden Ring. A miniboss can still pop out and wreck you harder than the required boss you’re on your way to fight. NPCs can die due to unforeseen story machinations. Some of you are probably thinking “that’s stupid that this is still around.” The Souls fans out there are rubbing their hands together in excitement.We do this discourse every time From Software releases something. It’s occasionally frustrating, but always exciting and unpredictable for a large group of people: myself included. I’m still thinking about a few of the game’s puzzles, and even took physical notes this time because of how much there was to track.Combat gets a lift from a more open loadout system. Mixing and matching playstyles and weapon types is super easy, and making your own potion to suit your needs (using a combination of two effects, which you’ll pick up throughout the game by killing tree guardians) is peak Elden Ring customization. From a mechanical perspective, most of the weapon types feel precise, and on a PS5, I had no real technical complaints. There are too many individual facets to talk about, but the amount of freedom I felt was overwhelming at times. Instead of just pumping stats into a character like so many other lite RPGs, I put some actual thought into how I wanted to approach everything. That includes weapon modification, what abilities to imbue, and what armor pieces to wear.Summoning NPCs as a magic spell (instead of through some laborious one-off sigil you might need to wait for or never find) is an insane upgrade for solo players both now and forever, as long as the game exists and servers become less populated. Crafting, while rote in many games, feels natural here, because the items you can craft actually matter to some builds, or you can ignore it entirely.A fully-fledged multiplayer component, which has everything from PVP to PVE in one place, could ensure that Elden Ring‘s legacy will live on as long as most of the other Souls games have. Again, it’s a long time coming, but it came all the same.So many challenges are optional that it not only funnels into that aforementioned genuine sense of discovery, but it also feels like you can choose how difficult you want the game to be. Sure, there are roadblocks in the sense that critical path encounters lead to new areas, potentially new items/upgrades, and better places to farm/level-up. Some of those gates are going to be annoying if you want a constant sense of story progression. I even felt the pang of linearity near the end of the game as things were wrapping up and funneling into a pointed series of boss fights.Given how much Elden Ring encourages you to sit back and enjoy it, it was never truly an issue for me, because I could take a break and go explore somewhere else. It also doesn’t sacrifice the core Souls loop of overcoming challenges and the sense of accomplishment that hits you like a ton of bricks afterward. Yes, that setup isn’t for everyone. But I also think that Elden Ring is one of the most accessible From offerings yet from a skill floor perspective, while catering to everyone who has been along for the ride this whole time (the ceiling can get high still).To say I was blown away by Elden Ring is an understatement. Sure it’s still going to appear esoteric and unapproachable to a subset of people. There are things it could still do better in terms of onboarding, and it could do even more on the front of quality-of-life enhancements for returning Souls players.But as an experience, it’s one of the most wondrous and open-ended games I’ve played in years. It has so much to say from a design perspective that people will be talking about its choices for years on end, and playing it for longer.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]Flawless10s aren't perfect, since nothing is, but they come as close as you could get in a given genre. The new leader to beat in its sector, we're talking pure ecstasy.

Elden Ring is one of the most anticipated games of all time. Since the reveal trailer was first shown at E3 2019, every little morsel of info about the game has made headlines. George R.R. Martin’s worldbuilding and Hidetaka Miyazaki’s writing and direction seemed like a match made in heaven, and fans have been on pins and needles to see if the end product can live up to their lofty expectations.It does.Elden Ring takes all the experience FromSoftware gained from creating the Souls series and adds to it to make one of the best open-world games ever made.Like past FromSoftware games, the lore in Elden Ring is complex and veiled. However, I will say the plot here is less opaque than it was in previous games, but you still have to do some digging to get at the full story. I’ll give a (very loose) rundown, but since part of it is gleaned from reading between the lines and piecing together snippets of conversations, I’m not even sure I have the whole picture.Long ago, the Lands Between was ruled by Queen Marika and her King Consort, the Elden Lord Godwyn the Golden. They commanded the power of the Elden Ring, and through it and the blessing of the great Erdtree, they forged a kingdom and ruled it in peace. For a time, things were idyllic (or at least not terrible), but dark forces conspired to upset the balance by stealing the Death Rune from the Elden Ring. As a result, the Elden Ring split into six Great Runes and came into the possession of the six leaders who ruled the six realms of the Lands Between.With the Elden Ring split, things get a bit wonky. The six Great Runes are incredibly powerful but corrupt those who use them. So, the six leaders became Demigods, but also became demented, and thus started the Shattering. The Demigods warned against one another, tearing the Lands Between asunder. However, none won a decisive victory and remain locked in a stalemate. Unfortunately, the crazed leaders killed almost all of the citizenry in the conflict, but with the Death Rune no longer in place, they are born again into miserable servitude to their twisted lords.You play as a Tarnished, a person (or descendant of one) who “lost the grace of the Erdtree” and was exiled at some point in the past. Grace (the name for the power that stems from the Erdtree) has called the Tarnished home in the hopes that one of them can gather the Great Runes, reforge the Elden Ring, and restore order as the new Elden Lord.All in all, it’s a sorrowful story since most of the participants didn’t choose their lot in life. The Lands Between is full of fallen heroes and victims of perpetual war. The remaining living humans are shellshocked and often half-crazed. It’s a depressing atmosphere, but there is hope, and not every story here ends in tragedy.The world of Elden Ring is an absolute marvel. This is one of the rare cases where a studio has really undersold both the scope and the quality of an open world. When I got the first piece of the map showing Limgrave and Stormveil Castle, I thought it must have been around 1/4 to 1/3 of the explorable territory. After all, Hidetaka Miyazaki himself estimated it would take approximately 30 hours to complete the game. I had only beaten the first of six Demigods at the 30-hour mark.The world map is huge, but it’s far from empty space. It’s packed with dungeons, mines, barrows, ruins, castles, camps, villages, forests, chasms, and all sorts of nooks and crannies to explore. In addition, there are quite a few “legacy dungeons” to explore that follow the traditional Souls format. These range in size from medium (places that hold a valuable item) to large (areas that usually contain a Demigod) and should sate any fan of the genre.If I had to compare the Lands Between to any other open world, it would be Breath of the Wild’s. There’s so much to do and see here, and few games capture the raw feeling of exploration like Elden Ring does. I’m still far from experiencing everything the game has to offer, and I estimate you could put well over 120 hours into it and still not have discovered everything.The important thing about the open-world in Elden Ring is how relevant it is for players to explore. This is a challenging game, and each optional place you visit gives you more items, gear, and Runes, which increases your survivability. There’s no list to check off here or baubles to collect, just ammunition against the overwhelming odds you have to face.The conversation about difficulty is a hallmark of Souls games, and people are chomping at the bit on all sides for the game to release to critique how easy or hard it is. I thought the game was easier than previous FromSoftware titles, but it’s not because it has been toned down in any way. It’s no less challenging; it’s just that you have more options available when confronting a situation.A lot of the frustration that people have with the Dark Souls series is that they’re relatively linear and that if you get stuck, you often have to keep throwing yourself against a situation until you manage to overcome it. Sure, you can go farm for XP or items or try another path, but you’re very limited in your options.In Elden Ring, whenever I ran into a boss I just couldn’t take down after the first few tries, I left and explored. Typically, I’d clear a few areas, find some upgrade materials and a new item or two, and then head back and take the boss out. Since every Site of Grace (bonfire) acts as a fast travel point, you can quickly dip out and take a breather if you start getting frustrated.Some FromSoftware fans will feel like Elden Ring goes too far to help the player out. However, I think this design is what might finally make this genre mainstream. It gives players a chance to take a step back, improve their character, get some more combat under their belt, and attempt a fight again renewed.I played Elden Ring on PC, and it’s a gorgeous game in 4K. However, I imagine mid-range PCs will struggle with it. Even with my hardware, I would get microstutter every once in a while. The odd thing is, it didn’t matter if I stayed at 4K or dropped down to 1440p; they still happened. Turning Resizable Bar on seemed to help a bit, but that might have been a placebo.My (admittedly amateur) take is that the game seems to aggressively pre-load each area. As a result, there was zero noticeable pop-in, but even with a PCI-e 4.0 SSD, things seem to get bogged down. I’m fine with the microstutter because this is one of the first games I’ve played where you can see clear across the map without any fog or programming tricks. It was a great feeling to see some far-away place and then later in the game realize you were there. It gives a sense of scale that you don’t often see in the medium.Unfortunately, there’s no DLSS, RTX, or FidelityFX here. I’d love to see DLSS added at some point since it would likely help with texture streaming and maybe cut some of the microstutter.Unfortunately, I didn’t get a chance to check out the console version of the game, so I can’t speak to performance there. I can’t imagine it would run great on a base PS4 or Xbox One, so I suggest anyone reading this check out some console footage before purchasing it.Elden Ring is a tour de force and is maybe the only example of a studio underselling a title. It’s an M-rated Breath of the Wild, full of secrets, intrigue, and an enthralling world to explore. It’s a game that makes me excited about gaming, and it’s fantastic to see a highly anticipated title like this turn out so well.Games like Elden Ring only come once or twice in a generation and raise the bar on what the medium can offer. It’s challenging and unfair at times, but it also gives you the tools to overcome any of its obstacles, and those who persevere will get one of the most satisfying experiences in gaming.10Jason Faulkner is the Senior Editor of Game Revolution and PlayStation LifeStyle.

Elden Ring,Paul Tassi,Forbes,https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2022/05/12/elden-ring-review-ps5-game-of-the-generation-so-far/,"Elden RingThis may be the latest I’ve done a scored review of a game, but hey, life calls, and not only did I delay starting up Elden Ring due to Horizon Forbidden West and Destiny 2: The Witch Queen being released the same week, but I also…then had a child, so here we are! And as a new gamer dad, I have managed to work my way all the way through Elden Ring, against all odds.And I’m sure glad I did.Some context: I’m not a Soulsborne person. Not really. I bounced off the original Demon’s Souls back in the day and have never played any of the Dark Souls trilogy. I did play Bloodborne to its conclusion, however, so that prepped me a little bit I suppose, albeit that was years ago at this point.Elden Ring, despite being another FromSoftware game, is another animal entirely, however. It’s larger, longer and I would argue, much more accessible, despite its moments of extreme difficulty and potential for progress loss. And it is one of the best games I’ve played in several years, and is easily the best game I’ve seen released since the dawn of the PS5/Xbox Series X generation. I kind of expect that to stand for a few more years to come, and GOTY for 2022 seems like a lock at this point, especially after recent delays.For starters, the world that Elden Ring has created here, The Lands Between, is an achievement not just for the developer, but for the entire concept of open worlds in games. I have played so many open world games at this point that I am frankly exhausted from the concept, but Elden Ring changed all that with its exceptionally diverse, massive map that never stopped being interesting after 100 hours, and there’s probably 100 more worth of secret hunting you could extract from it in a single playthrough. While sure, we have our “biomes,” starter greenery, a swamp, an icy mountain, it never feels derivative and features some of the best scenic storytelling I’ve seen, on top of masterful level design that uses verticality, both above and below ground, in a way we rarely see in maps like this.Elden RingMy journey through The Lands Between was as a mage, casting spells first with a shield, then later with a set of Wolverine claws I had modified to let me teleport out of harm’s way. This is the first FromSoftware game where magic is not just an option, but a truly large part of the game, capable of multiple, powerful builds between Int, Faith, Arcane and weapons that use all three. Focused mainly on Int, I was slinging tracking meteorites and throwing icy moons at people by the end. I’m told Faith is probably the more interesting path to go down with more entertaining spells, but I still had a good time regardless.My build had me spamming spells while my summons, first skeletons, then a copy of myself, then a DPS maniac assassin, helped me out and got me through the toughest fights. You can overlevel for most of the content in the game if you do enough sidequests or rune farming, but eventually you will hit a point where it doesn’t matter, as the last third of the game kicks the difficulty into its final form, and no amount of power will save you. The game’s hardest boss, Malenia, will haunt my nightmares for years to come, and she’s already a video game legend (as is a real-life player you can summon to solo her).Combat is fun with any type of build, but where the game really shines is exploration. I cannot get over how truly dense this map is, where it lacks any real sort of indicators about where you should go and what you should do, but simply going anywhere, doing anything, will lead you to interesting locations, scenarios and treasures, and if you don’t explore enough, you can miss entire, massive chunks of a game, like an entire sprawling zone you can only reach if you get two halves of a single medallion from one NPC and one chest out of thousands.If I have any criticisms of Elden Ring it’s that perhaps sometimes it can be a little too obtuse. While I enjoy figuring things out for myself, there are many points in the game where it would be literally impossible not to break quests or miss endings or loot without looking up guides, and the longer the game goes, the more there is to miss. There’s “tricky” and there’s “accidentally completing one quest too early 70 hours ago completely breaks the chain of this entire zone,” requiring another full playthrough to get it right. There are too many instances like this, which is why I found myself looking up guides more and more as the game went on, as I felt like I would be ruining the game in spite of myself simply trying to figure it all out for my own.Elden RingThis is also not a game you’re going to play for its story. Yes, it has some memorable characters and wild cutscenes, but not many, and not often. You will have to do a lot of the heavy lifting yourself to read up on the lore of this world and what’s going on here in this space that George RR Martin himself helped created. While I like the mythology, mainly reading item descriptions and looking up YouTube lore videos is not what I’d call an ideal practice of video game storytelling.But again, in the grand scheme of things, these are minor instances, and in fact, reasons to give the game another playthrough with a new build and not missing all the stuff you know not to miss the second time. I don’t know if I have time for that any time soon, but I can see the benefit.Elden Ring is a stunning achievement from a literal video game architecture perspective, along with creating a difficult but not wildly punishing game that everyone, even non-Soulsborne devotees, should be able to enjoy. I have not been this impressed with an open world since Skyrim, and Elden Ring even surpasses that in many ways. It’s an easy game to recommend to anyone and everyone, and deserves the explosive sales success we’ve seen, dwarfing old FromSoft records. Elden Ring is a gaming achievement the likes of which we rarely seen, and you will be remiss to not pick it up and see what the hype is about for yourself.Score: 10/10Follow me on Twitter, YouTube, Facebook and Instagram.

Elden Ring,Sam Chandler,Shacknews,https://www.shacknews.com/article/128948/elden-ring-review-the-transcended-soul,"New to Shacknews? Signup for a Free AccountAlready have an account? Login NowElden Ring is FromSoftware's most ambitious title, acting as the culmination of 30 years' worth of practice, and delivering the best the genre has to offer.For a lot of players, the Soulsborne genre started with Demon’s Souls or Dark Souls, but both of those titles owe a lot to FromSoftware’s first game, King’s Field. Almost 30 years later, we have Elden Ring, the developer’s latest and most ambitious title. The game managed to hit every expectation I had for it, while still leaving me continually shocked and awestruck. It feels as though this is the genre’s final form, Hidetaka Miyazaki’s magnum opus.The story of Elden Ring is precisely what you might expect. The high fantasy world is a twisted and gnarled version of its former glory, as ruin has fallen upon the land. You are a Tarnished, an exiled person who has returned to the Lands Between to seek the Great Runes, the shards of the now-broken Elden Ring. Defeat the demigods who hold them and become the Elden Lord.But that is only part of the story and the main objective. The actual narrative and lore is as rich and interwoven as the community has come to anticipate, offering only the slightest insight into the world they’re exploring. Information can be gleaned from optional dialogue, reading item descriptions, and of course, looking at the environment and drawing your own conclusions.One of the big marketing pushes for the game was that George R. R. Martin was involved in the creation of the game’s backstory, setting the foundation on which the current-day story unfolds. While I could not definitely point to an element and say “This is clearly Martin’s work,” the underlying narrative feels far grander than what has come before. It is positively dripping with mythology and legends that will no doubt be investigated by lore aficionados.The sense of discovery and clarifying moments of the story are as impactful as they’ve ever been in the Soulsborne series of games. Elements of the world are slowly revealed, adding layers of knowledge while simultaneously shirking expectations.Like previous titles, NPCs make up a large portion of the storytelling effort. These characters have their own goals and often request your assistance. And like the games that came before, the player will likely understand little but accept all requests, if only to see what happens next.It feels as though Elden Ring is FromSoftware’s original vision for the genre finally realized. Like all that came before were a series of stepping stones that the developers have been walking along in order to reach this point. Though the core gameplay on offer here is unchanged from the formula that was laid out with Demon’s Souls, it has been polished to a glistening sheen.The combat is brutal and precise, utilizing the health, stamina, and magic meters to guide the pacing of encounters, forcing you to juggle resources. For sorcerers, Soul Arrow-like spells return along with gravity-based attacks that draw in enemies or send out shockwaves. Melee fighters have a wealth of new options too. One short sword I discovered had a telekinesis-like Ashes of War move that sent the sword out a few feet, twisted like a screw, and returned.Speaking of Ashes of War, these are abilities that can be applied to your armaments, offering a sort of special attack or enhancement. These range from the classic kick and parry moves to ones that boost the damage of your next attack, infuse attacks with blood power, offer greater protection, and dozens more. Think of them like you would weapon arts, requiring activation during combat and sometimes consuming the Focus meter. Better yet, they can be taken off one armament and applied to another.As for Spirits, these are ghostly allies that you can summon to aid you in battle. Not anywhere near as powerful as an actual NPC summon, these are more like trash mobs that offer some distraction or just a bit of extra assistance. A personal favorite of mine is a jellyfish called Aurelia that uses a long-range poison attack.Weapons and Spirits can be upgraded using the series’ iconic smithing system whereby attack thresholds can only be overcome by collecting the stronger version of an upgrade material. Thankfully, weapon affinity and intrinsic elemental damage can be changed at no cost, allowing the you to switch between things like a Standard affinity, Quality affinity for stat-scaling damage and things like Fire and Frost damage.Ever since Dark Souls, the genre has been a quasi-open world experience. You could, in some instances, go to just about anywhere in the map at any time, provided you knew the path. Now, Elden Ring has fully embraced the open world format, allowing you to venture to the far corners of the world with the only obstacles being the challenges faced along the way.To aid in your exploration of the Lands Between is your steed, Torrent, which can be summoned instantly. Torrent is capable of double-jumping and using gusts of wind to leap great heights. The horse is also instrumental during some larger boss fights, where speed is key, allowing you to gallop in on horseback, swinging your sword as you go.Thankfully, Torrent is available right out of the gates, which alleviates any of the potential tedium that can come with exploring such a vast open world. Better yet, where other open world games falter with the content between the major locations, Elden Ring is positively packed with little moments and treats to discover.Quite often I would be galloping towards the next major landmark on the horizon, only to be distracted by a band of soldiers marching along the road or a major enemy defending a doorway in the side of a cliff. There are also classic open world tropes, cleverly disguised in a way that only FromSoftware can do. There are sorcerers’ towers dotted on the map, locked until you can solve their puzzle, which grants you access to the top where a reward awaits. There are also paintings to discover out in the world, and if you manage to find the area depicted, a treasure can be earned.Crafting is also a new addition, allowing you to gather resources from the land and enemies and combine them. These resources are used to craft things like arrows and bolts, coatings for weapons, and consumables to rid yourself of ailments or buff your stats. Other open world games should take heed, as Elden Ring does not bog you down when it comes to resource gathering. A simple tap of the button and the item is in your inventory, no arduous collecting animation, even allowing you to do so while galloping along on your horse.I was constantly in awe at the size and level of detail in the world’s construction. What I took to be a flat plateau when looking at the beautifully hand-drawn map was in fact a winding ravine full of foliage. Similarly, the world uses imagery that is unlike anything in a Soulsborne game to date. The environments are breathtaking and surreal, both horrifying with its monstrosities and grotesque oddities and beautiful with its stunning landscapes. It’s truly mesmerizing.Speaking of the map, it does eventually become dotted with icons that you discover, be it the bonfire-like Sites of Grace that act as fast travel points or icons of buildings, caves, and structures you find. Unlike other open world games, these don’t get crossed off or faded out once searched, so it’ll be up to you to remember where you’ve been.The scope of the world in Elden Ring left me absolutely floored. Just when I thought there was no new experience or new vista, my jaw would hit the floor as some incredible sight or devious surprise revealed itself. I underestimated what was on offer here. It’s a bigger and richer world than any of the other titles in FromSoftware’s illustrious catalog.FromSoftware has made a name for itself with its Soulsborne series of games. There’s a certain level of challenge that is expected and that remains true with Elden Ring. Though it isn’t as immediately difficult or a shock to the system as Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Elden Ring provided me with ample challenge in both boss fights and general exploration.As with all these titles, a boss that is difficult for one will be a breeze for another. But as with previous games, it’s possible to alleviate some of the difficulty by just dumping points into health. On top of this, thanks to the open world format, you can just choose to go elsewhere and try another area out. You might opt to completely circumvent the first boss, choosing to venture further north or even spend hours gathering resources to upgrade your equipment.But at some point, you will need to tackle the game’s more linear and claustrophobic locations. These areas highlight the impeccable level design the team at FromSoftware is capable of delivering. Corralling and defeating enemies as you leap over roofs (thanks to the handy jump button) in search of the next Site of Grace is a stressful experience, as is weighing up whether to push forward or return to the previous resting point to level up.The environment was also a form of challenge. Seeing a location in the distance, and musing how to reach it, provided a different sort of puzzle. More than once I would place a marker on the map and work my way there, only to realize it was either hundreds of feet down a ravine or up some seemingly unscalable cliff.These challenges can also be enhanced or reduced with the summoning of both NPC and real players. After the brief hiatus of multiplayer with Sekiro, it’s a joy to be able to dive once more into a rich Soulsborne title with allies or invade another player’s game to spread a little bit of mischief.Elden Ring is nearly a flawless experience, were it not for a few hiccups with the steed Torrent and some frame rate issues, likely due to dated hardware. As for the issues with the horse, there were a few times where upon trying to summon it, the horse would not appear but my character would float in mid-air until he “fell” to his death.On the hardware front, those with older PC setups beware: Elden Ring is a demanding beast. Even on medium settings, my NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti and AMD Ryzen 7 1700X 8 Core 3.4 GHz struggled at times, specifically when there were a lot of enemies or when the massive vistas were on-screen. In saying this, these faults were eclipsed by everything else on offer in Elden Ring.Simply put, Elden Ring is Miyazaki and FromSoftware’s magnum opus. It feels like the vision for the genre has reached its final form. Elden Ring is a meticulously crafted game, with a world begging to be explored and experienced. It is truly mesmerizing in its scope, an astonishing success and everything I had hoped it would be. Forget what you knew about the genre, the real Soulsborne starts here, with Elden Ring.This review is based on a Steam code provided by the publisher.

Elden Ring,Sherif Saed,VG247,https://www.vg247.com/elden-ring-review-pc,"Elden Ring has been worth the wait.Elden Ring is an open world game, but perhaps not in the way you might think when you first hear those words. It's not about waypoints pointing you off to a distant location, or following a map that over-populates with activity icons. Instead, it's about pure, unbridled exploration. Think about the hands-off, player-trusting approach previous Souls games took to things like character progression and storytelling. Apply that philosophy to an open-ended land, and you get the backbone of a game that is, ultimately, a bit of a masterpiece.The game is named Elden Ring after an all-powerful plot MacGuffin, but I came to think of it as Endless Ring. The early game is relentless in handing you a series of key tools in quick succession – most importantly your horse – but then it sets you free. Venture in any random direction you want. Something catch your eye? Try to make your way there. Do what you want. Elden Ring doesn't care. The result feels vaguely ridiculous. Over 60 hours into the game, I was still discovering entire hidden areas, caves tucked away into the side of mountains, walking mausoleums, crumbled shacks with a wayward NPC or an intriguing tale to be uncovered. Much of this is accessible from the beginning – only a scant few areas are locked behind bosses or other progression gates. And even when something is kept gated from you, it feels mind-bogglingly expansive rather than cheap; when defeating a boss causes a world state change that opens up vast new areas it's amazing enough – but when it happens 50+ hours in, and to an area you thought you'd exhausted, it's difficult to not say ‘wow’.  Elden Ring is not just adept at consistently creating this sense of mystery as you simply gallop through its world, it’s also ready to reward you for going after those pursuits. You’ll come away with crafting and upgrade materials, new weapons and armour – and you might even meet unique characters and fight bosses you won’t otherwise see on the main path. And what main path? Well, there is one – but it is, by design, pretty obscure. Without getting into spoilers, here's how it works: there are several Lords out in the world, hiding away inside 'Legacy Dungeons', more traditional Souls levels where your horse isn't available. You'll need to beat at least two of these Lords in order to progress to a key story location – but in terms of the first half of the game, that is the sum total of what you must do.  The areas you explore, route you take, and enemies you face down along the way will differ depending on your approach – and FromSoftware appears to have built the game with divergent routes and deliberate sequence breaks in mind. Basically, speed-running strats and optimisation for this game are going to be delicious. The back third of the game feels a little more directed and features more mandatory bosses, but the world is still resolutely open. From’s other major pillar is combat. Elden Ring brings back the tried-and-true stamina-based combat we’re used to from Soulsborne games, and even finds room to incorporate a thing or two from Sekiro. Encounters are often challenging, particularly early on, and the variety of enemies you fight spur you to change your play style so you’re not locked into the standard sword-and-board or i-frame dodge spam (which is when you avoid hits by rolling into them). This fluidity wasn’t always easy to come to terms with, as I tend to play these games one way for the entirety of a playthrough – only changing my style when absolutely necessary. I was not prepared to have to juggle a couple of different weapons, outfits, and even my approach to certain situations over the course of the game. That has always been true for bosses, of course, but you’ll be dealing with this shift in design as you traverse Elden Ring’s overworld. It’s a tweak to that tried-and-tested formula that makes the whole experience even more compelling. To facilitate the need for a variety of playstyles, Elden Ring makes it easy to equip and keep ranged options on hand. That may be a standard bow or crossbow, or a staff for some fire-and-forget magic spells. You’re encouraged to diversify beyond what you might be used to from past games; well-rounded characters will have an easier time in this world, whereas specialists might die (more). Traditional series elements have been tweaked to tie combat and exploration together. One constant concern in other Souls games was how finite healing items are, for instance. This is still true in Elden Ring, but out in the overworld, defeating groups of enemies or certain rare critters offers refills to your HP or FP flasks. This might sound like it goes against the signature difficulty of these games, but it is simply an open-world conceit – there's no such respite within dungeons. By giving you a way to refill your healing resource, Elden Ring is essentially refueling your sense of discovery. Checkpoints also serve to help ease exploration. If you bump into a huge boss in the open world, it’ll inevitably be close to a Stake of Marika, and when you die you’ll be given the option of spawning at a Site of Grace (that’s a bonfire, basically) or at the Stake as a checkpoint. Plus there’s your horse, which is fast enough that you can summon it, retrieve the Runes (that’s Souls) lost on death and disappear before enemies are any the wiser. Combat is another element that will also benefit from your hunger for exploration. Your repertoire of moves will increase as you expand your Ash of War library, not to mention your stock of weapons and upgrade materials themselves. Ashes of War are essentially Weapon Arts from Dark Souls 3, refined to be actually viable rather than just a novelty. Each Ash of War ties a certain move or skill to a weapon, available when two-handing it. They consume varying amounts of FP, but it’s usually low enough that even a warrior-type character with low investment in Mind (the FP stat) can still regularly rely on them for that quick flash of fancy finesse where necessary. This marriage of exploration and combat informs Elden Ring's rare cohesion in design. The deeper you look, the more of these multi-faceted elements will reveal themselves. Your steed, Torrent, is obviously necessary to quickly travel vast distances in the overworld, but its combat benefits are less clear. You can fight on horseback, and you’ll come across many enemy units doing the same. Horseback combat is sadly a little clumsy, though. Even though you can control which side of the horse your weapon swings, I found that hits have a tendency to whiff (including when you’re locked on to enemies). It’s not always clear whether this is a height or a distance problem, but you’ll be left hoping your weapon was just a tad longer fairly often.  Nevertheless, having the ability to take on enemies from horseback creates several new gameplay opportunities. I found it particularly useful to pick off a few stragglers before dismounting to hit the main camp. The speed of the horse also comes in handy when rushing to eliminate the units that can call reinforcements, before dealing with the rest of the squad. It can even be amusing to perform a few hit-and-runs on some helpless infantry as you run circles around them while they struggle to track you.  Torrent’s real combat role becomes almost a necessity when taking on field bosses, which is something new in Elden Ring. As you explore the world, you’ll find these towering knights, monsters, dragons – or inexplicable creatures that you would typically be locked in an arena with – simply patrolling an area. Once you start the fight, the health bar shows up, and the music kicks in – except, of course, the 'arena' is essentially anywhere you like. Bosses will not follow you everywhere, however, and will attempt to go back to their intended area when you try to trick them into cheese spots. Having a horse makes the experience of fighting those bosses unique from the enclosed arena fights you’re used to. Many of their attacks are also wide and far-reaching enough to nudge you into staying on your horse to easily outrun them. All of the horse's movement abilities, such as the double-jump, are unlocked from the off. That said, I do wish Torrent had a few more combat abilities beyond just being a mount. In order to sustain your long journeys, Elden Ring introduces a crafting system. This ends up being one of the game’s weakest elements, ironically because it’s more fleshed out than I would have liked. There are some 40-something crafting materials you’ll find across the game’s world. Everything from animal and bird parts, to fungi, flora, and bugs – you name it. Rather than be informed by the same mantra of exploration and discovery, crafting in Elden Ring is an arbitrary, game-y process. You might have everything you need to craft an item, but you won’t be able to until you find the specific cookbook – and there are plenty of those – which unlocks the ability to do it. The sheer number and distribution of crafting materials also makes it unlikely that you’ll organically have everything you need, whenever you feel like you need it. More often than not, you’ll be checking the menu to craft something, only to find that you’re missing one or more components. I don’t imagine anyone is going to stop what they’re doing in that instance and try and look for the missing ingredient. This level of depth is more suited to survival games, where it’s common to regularly consult a compendium of crafting materials and their locations as you play. In a FromSoft game, it feels almost shoe-horned in; an element gleaned from Breath of the Wild that could have happily stayed in Hyrule. When crafting was revealed ahead of Elden Ring’s launch, I thought it would be a lot more scrappy; the type of system that quickly lets you turn twigs into arrows behind cover before reemerging to continue the fight. But the crafting system we ended up with actually gets locked as soon as you enter combat, and though the options it offers are vast, it also relies on a needlessly long list of ingredients. I’ve only really used it to craft arrows, throwing darts, and the occasional boosts. Typically, I would check if I can craft something, and end up just buying it because some ingredients are missing. Not exactly the revolutionary system you might have been hoping for. Perhaps the most disappointing aspect about Elden Ring is its general difficulty. This might seem like a strange point to bring up, considering the subject, but it often felt like encounters are designed with co-op, or the new AI summon mechanic in mind. As in earlier From games, you can touch the summon signs of NPCs and other human players to aid you along the way. But while those are typically meant for boss fights, there’s another system that will help you deal with the difficulty of normal encounters. As you explore Elden Ring’s world, complete quests and so on, you’ll accumulate spirits of fallen warriors. These come in the form of a single, powerful unit, or a group of them. The first one you acquire lets you call on wolves, for example. You use FP to summon your allies, and you can only do so in areas with a Rebirth Monument. The game shows an icon on your HUD to let you know it’s possible to summon. The FP cost varies from one spirit to the next, and you can only summon one group per Rebirth Monument.I initially suspected that this mechanic was meant to aid players new to FromSoftware’s games. Elden Ring is poised to be the studio’s biggest hit, so it’s understandable that the team wanted a soft difficulty modifier so as not to crush those of us not used to how grueling these games can be. But the more I played, the more it became clear that the game expects you to summon your spirit friends. And often. A lot of the open-world encounters in the mid and late-game will pit you against large groups containing multiple heavy-hitting, tanky units. You can certainly spend a few minutes peeling individual units off one by one, but this can get tiresome after 30 hours or so. Spirit summons can help keep enemies occupied as you either slip past them, or keep them distracted enough that you can deal damage with little risk. I've also found that bosses expect you to summon here and there. Even with power-appropriate weapons, bosses in Elden Ring have shockingly large HP. Part of that is the fact that the same bar now includes both phases, but it’s still larger than I’ve come to expect. Boss design has evolved significantly since the days you could run circles around them. Many of them are ferocious, and will consistently track you, even mid-combo.They also have a tendency to chase after you the minute you pull away to heal up. All of this made it more difficult for me to take them on solo, as I always do. To From’s credit, boss super armour is more pronounced now than it’s ever been. Even though that status is never exposed, you can gradually chip away at super armour by landing overhead and charged heavy attacks. If you keep on the offensive, even if just throwing feeble bone darts at them to prevent it from rebounding, you’re more likely to stagger them and hear the big boom letting you know you can get in for a critical hit. That said, this isn't a game I was able to single-character from start to finish, which is something I look forward to from the studio’s work. Though my issues with crafting can mostly be alleviated by simply ignoring the system altogether, difficulty and its direct relation to summons is a problem that didn’t need to exist. I played Elden Ring on a powerful PC with an i7 9700K and a 3080 Ti. The game can’t go over 60fps, like other From games. It ran about as well as I expected at 4K with everything maxed out, with the occasional drops in effects-heavy scenes. However, the game’s biggest performance hiccup is stuttering: they’re most certainly related to asset streaming because they tend to occur in the open world when you quickly turn one direction the game wasn’t expecting you to. Even on a Gen 3 NVMe SSD, these stutters could be clearly felt – and sometimes lasted for several seconds. It’s hard to say whether this will be improved, but as it currently stands, it’s going to get you killed now and then. None of my complaints were enough to sour my time with Elden Ring, though. I have been playing it almost non-stop for a week, and I’ve wanted to jump back in every chance I got – even at the height of my frustration with it. Elden Ring is a sublime action game with exceptional level design that does a great service to both its classic Legacy Dungeon expectations, and its open world ambitions. Beyond that, it continues to prove that FromSoftware understands what makes its work special. I went in expecting Elden Ring to be a good game, but I wasn’t quite ready for (almost) all of its individual components to be this well in-sync. FromSoftware is clearly a studio capable of sensible innovation, iterating only on the best parts of its lineage, and that can be keenly felt in Elden Ring. Whenever a game gets a perfect review score, it brings up the argument of whether it’s really a perfect game, or if a perfect game even exists. The interpretation of what’s deserving that score likely varies from one player to another, but I don’t believe it denotes a game devoid of issues. As this review details, Elden Ring is not without its missteps.  What ultimately matters, however, is that Elden Ring succeeds at almost every goal it sets out to achieve. It’s the culmination of years of refinement of FromSoftware’s formula. Mechanically, and thematically, this is a game making a statement: that you can buck industry tendencies even as you adopt their trends. Version tested: PC. Code provided by publisher.

While that experience gave me some appreciation for From Software’s uncompromising game design, it was also enough to convince me that I didn’t have the temperament to pour dozens of hours into these sorts of games. I get why so many people find this unforgiving style appealing, and I’ve even willingly dipped my toes into From Software’s further catalog from time to time. But I just couldn’t overcome the frustration factor necessary to really commit to a deep dive into these meticulously crafted worlds.Then the buzz began for Elden Ring, the latest game in what has become known as From's “Soulsborne” style. Director Hidetaka Miyazaki promised in interviews that the new title would be more accessible than his previous From Software work, with quality-of-life improvements like more frequent checkpoints, easier health management, and an open-world design that doesn’t gatekeep progress behind nigh-impossible bosses.That kind of talk was enough to get me to dive deep into the Soulsborne world one more time. And I’m glad I did. While Elden Ring doesn’t really make the Soulsborne experience any easier, per se, its open-world design and gameplay adjustments tweak the balance of rewards and frustrations just enough to make the whole experience enjoyable—even for a skeptic like me.The involvement of legendary fantasy author George R.R. Martin in Elden Ring’s development might have some players hoping for a Song of Ice and Fire-style story that captures the internecine history and complex interpersonal family drama of warring factions. Those hopes would be misplaced, though, as Elden Ring’s storytelling is characteristically sparse and cryptic.A short introductory cutscene introduces players to the titular Elden Ring, a powerful, magical piece of jewelry that has been shattered and had its pieces distributed to the children of Queen Marika. The shards give those children the “mad taint of the newfound strength” that leads to a “war from which no lord arose.”As a result, the shattered world of the Lands Beyond is now filled with the Tarnished, those who are “dead who yet live.” As one such Tarnished of “no renown,” it’s up to you to hunt down your fellow Tarnished, unite the pieces of the shattered ring, and bring order to a now-chaotic land.That initial info dump is by far the most direct exposition you’ll get from Elden Ring. You’ll have to figure out everything else from the snippets of information shared by the world's scattered non-player characters, who are holding out amid the destruction in ruined churches or dilapidated shacks.Almost to a person, these “survivors” speak with a creepy, ethereal tone that suggests an utter lack of hope. They all present their fragmentary lore in a cryptic, roundabout manner that offers only the barest hint of how the world got to its current state. Piecing together the social history of this fallen world is like trying to solve a jigsaw puzzle when you only get a single random piece every half hour.Instead of exposition, Elden Ring leans on extremely strong environmental storytelling. Every part of the game’s sprawling map seems masterfully crafted to point to a deeper history you’ll only ever be vaguely aware of.You might climb a jagged stone outcropping to realize minutes later that it’s actually the half-shattered head of a gigantic statue of some long-forgotten hero of the old world. Later, you could stumble on a flooded town where you have to dance across the barely visible rooftops above the swamp-waterline to reach your next objective. Then you’ll happen upon a ramshackle mining operation with layer upon layer of vertical scaffolding extending deep into a mountain.It’s not just the architecture, either. You’ll catch enemies lingering around the tattered remains of fallen heroes, guarding their valuable gear with both zealousness and indifference. Or you might spot a caravan of undead soldiers leading two giants chained to a mysterious cart and marching in a damned circuit forever.There's a pervasive, unsettling air of recently faded grandeur—echoes of a massive civilization you’ll never truly know. While there’s surely lore to be mined for those determined enough to piece it together, Elden Ring is much more effective at imparting vibes than distinct plotlines, and it's probably better off for it.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

Elden Ring,Mick Fraser,God is a Geek,https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/elden-ring-review/,"February 25, 2022Much has been made of George R.R. Martin’s involvement in Elden Ring. Not for nothing, the veteran fantasy and sci-fi author was brought on board by Director Hidetaka Miyazaki to build an intricate, epic history for the Lands Between. The world presented here is certainly FromSoftware’s most fleshed-out and documented setting. That said, though, Elden Ring still has that Dark Soulsian habit of pushing its story to one side in favour of the spectacle. It gets away with it, mostly, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that this time, a little traditional storytelling would have been appreciated.But look, I’m aware that arguing a FromSoftware game needs more story is like arguing a Snickers bar needs more peanuts. There’s already plenty in it, if you care to pay attention to what you’re consuming – they’re just easy to miss among all the other good stuff.The Lands Between setting is the culmination of what FromSoftware have been doing for the last 14 years. It has elements of both Lordran and Drangleic in its DNA, but it also has some of the unexpected beauty of Sekiro’s fantastical Japan, too. Thanks to the Closed Network Tests and numerous preview sessions, that first step out of the darkness into Limgrave may have been spoiled for many, but in Elden Ring that’s truly the tip of the iceberg. You may have seen everything everyone has already discovered in Limgrave, but as a great man once said, “You ain’t seen nothin’ yet.”You are a Tarnished, a resurrected former lord who has returned to the Lands Between to gather the pieces of the titular Elden Ring. This cosmic, deified artefact is presented as a collection of thousands of Runes, eldritch symbols that contain the power of creation. The Lands Between were ruled by Demigods in ages past, but when the Rune of Death was stolen, they went to war, pulling Runes from the broken ring to bolster their own powers. The result was a madness known as the Taint, which persisted through the time of the Shattering to present day. The world is out of balance, the few demigods that remain are hideous monstrosities, and you are here to put it right.Elden Ring’s overarching plot is that of a spectacular fantasy epic. The scale is greater than anything From have done before, and it shows in every element of this adventure. Because that’s what this is, by the way: an adventure. Where previous From games have been challenging journeys into the darkness, characterised by hopeless despair and a sense of attrition, Elden Ring feels like more than just another quest story.Much of that feeling comes from the structure. From have always excelled at giving the player options in terms of where to go next. Their games open up organically, so intuitively constructed that you rarely need a map to find your way from one place to another. Elden Ring takes this and magnifies it. I was still marvelling at how much there was to do and find in Limgrave when I stumbled into a second area just as large. And it keeps going. On more than one occasion I wondered if it was just too big and too full for its own good.But this grants an unprecedented level of freedom. As an open world, the Lands Between is analogous to only two others: Breath of the Wild’s Hyrule, and Skyrim. It’s not just that its non-linear, or as high as it is wide – it’s the sense of fullness. Without throwing shade, this is the antithesis of a Ubisoft open world. It’s not a checklist of things to do, or a map full of icons to go to and indulge in repetitive activities.Everywhere you go is different to everywhere else. It may not have the sheer number of dungeons and towns that Skyrim has, or perhaps the inviting breadth and easy charm of Hyrule, but Elden Ring’s world combines enough elements of the two that it comfortably takes its place among them. To call it game-changing sounds like hyperbole, but it’s the truth. The runtime isn’t padded out with endless environmental puzzles or fetch quests – the world simply begs you to explore its every distant corner.Once you have access to your spectral steed, Torrent, the world opens up to you. Wildlife darts between the trees, the weather changes dynamically, and a day-night cycle allows you to feel the passing of time naturally. Bonfires and lanterns are replaced by Sites of Grace, where you can level up and alter elements of your character. Crucially, you can also fast travel instantly to any of them provided you’re outdoors and out of combat. I say “replaced” because they’re functionally identical to points of sanctuary in other From games. Anyone going into Elden Ring from previous entries in this loosely-linked series will recognise multiple elements.The weapon and character upgrades work the same way they always have, with a few tweaks. Early on you’ll be invited to the Roundtable Hold, a sort-of hub where NPCs you meet and aid will gather to offer services and sage advice. It feels like Bloodborne’s cathedral or Medula in Dark Souls 2. It creates a sense of progression and accomplishment that also feels comfortingly familiar.As expected, the Lands Between are fraught with danger. Much of Limgrave is designed to be more accessible and even welcoming in places. Newcomers will delve its multiple dungeons for items and gear, facing off against bosses that almost gently prepare them for what’s to come. It should be said that most of the other areas have significantly fewer dungeons than Limgrave, with most of the action taking place in the Overworld. There are still plenty of places to explore, but Limgrave is very much a flex on FromSoftware’s part.To fill your world map you’ll need to locate fragments from special pillars in each area. As the landscape takes shape, you’ll begin to get a sense of the sheer scale. And every little landmark is worth exploring, too. What looks like a ruin on the map might be a Fort, a tiny cave mouth may well lead to a sprawling dungeon. Buildings, bridges, ravines and valleys, little patches of trees, and scattered lakes all hold secrets worth uncovering. But of course, adventuring is a dangerous business.Combat in Elden Ring doesn’t deviate greatly from previous From titles. Parries and counters, backstabs and dodge rolls, the ability to wield any weapon two-handed – all these elements are present. Stamina management is key for all classes, but those who build towards magical offence will need to manage their Focus, too. In addition to this there are weapon arts represented by the Ashes of War, which apply specific powerful abilities to your weapons. Talismans replace rings to bestow buffs and bonuses. Death will take away your Runes and return you to the nearest Site of Grace or Statue of Marika you found, and if you die again you’ll lose what you’ve accrued.Multiplayer is a mix between cooperative questing and PvP duelling. There are no great changes to the formula here. Once again you can opt to place a summon sign to make yourself available to help others, or request a hand from other players to aid your own endeavours. Being online at all brings its own dangers, however, as you leave yourself open to invasion by other players that can cost you dearly. By and large the Dark Souls community understand the rules, and trolls are a minority. It’s just something to be aware of.In any event, combat is sublime, punishing recklessness but rewarding courage and patience. The larger bosses, the Demigods and their pretenders, offer a stiff challenge that will almost certainly feel like hitting brick walls to many. The difference is that here, you have the freedom to leave those bosses and explore elsewhere, to level up and tackle entire new areas. There is a critical path, but you can put it first or last on your to-do list.Elden Ring takes other cues from Link’s adventure, too. Cookbooks can be found or bought that teach crafting recipes, and reagents and ingredients are everywhere. Flowers and resin, rocks and gemstones, animal parts cleaved from the endemic wildlife. You can craft multiple items from ammunition to bombs, potions to salves, but you’ll always need to rely on your Flask to restore Health and Focus Points. Certain items increase their efficacy, but you’ll need to search high and low to find them.Ultimately your starting class will only determine the early game and you’ll be free to build however you like. The freedom is immense, as Elden Ring offers multiple ways to farm Runes, the currency with which you’ll level up and buy items. If you want to be a shirtless barbarian with a human-sized cudgel on one shoulder and a fireball in the other hand, you can. It’s just a matter of allocating points where you need them with each level.As each new area stretches before you, the sense of grandeur and discovery increases. From sun-pierced forests and ancient bowers to grotesque landscapes like you’re traversing the insides of some cosmic colossus, the Lands Between are wonderfully diverse and rich with atmosphere, mystery and danger. Trapped chests can teleport you to far-flung reaches of the uncharted map, where enemies vastly out-level you and simply getting back becomes a challenge. NPCs issue side quests that weave their own mini stories, often rewarding you with unique items and services for your trouble.On the odd occasion, this freedom can work against Elden Ring. So much has been made of the world building, and so enticing is the setting, that now and then I longed for From to just tell me some story. Give me some cutscenes, a little exposition, or maybe some direction. Because now and then it’s nothing short of intimidating. At a certain point, after defeating the first of what Elden Ring terms “Legacy bosses” I was presented with a new facet to my quest: find a specific tower to reactivate the Great Rune I had acquired. At the time I was roughly 15 hours in and suddenly I was facing four full areas to explore however I chose. The sense of awe and scale was staggering, but it led to a short period of me tentatively stabbing into the darkness before settling on a route. It’s intentional, of course, but those who crave direction or guidance might find it overwhelming.Elden Ring is a landmark title. Just as FromSoftware have previously pushed the boundaries of acceptable challenge, organic storytelling, and grandiose world-building, here they present a level of freedom and exploration rarely seen. This is not a case of just going to the place and doing the thing over and over until the map turns from red to blue. It’s about picking a direction and riding in it, encountering enemies you can’t imagine beating and then beating them; being puzzled by a mystery that won’t make sense until hours later; it’s finding gear you can’t wait to be strong enough to use, or meeting enigmatic characters who may prove ally or enemy depending on trajectories you can’t yet predict.That Elden Ring borrows assets and elements from its spiritual predecessors becomes an almost petty complaint. The way it weaves the familiar into the unknown creates a unique sense of adventure for series veterans, while the more accessible opening area allows newcomers to find their feet before jumping in headlong. In many ways, Elden Ring is a true magnum opus. It is the masters of a genre they created showing the pretenders and tributaries how it should be done, while teaching other open world developers a thing or two at the same time. And yet it’s not too proud or lofty to take cues from the very best of the rest. Quite simply, Elden Ring is FromSoftware’s biggest and boldest title to date, and one of the most thrilling open worlds ever built.Unprecedented open world

Elden Ring,William Schwartz,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/elden-ring-review/,"When it was announced that From Software would be collaborating with George R.R. Martin for an open world fantasy RPG mouths across the internet started to water.  From Software has been absolutely killing it with their recent releases, it’s been a gradual climb upwards since Dark Souls took the gaming world by storm.  They’ve created such interesting and mysterious worlds with their notable work in Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Bloodborne, and the Dark Souls series over the last decade.  The punishing fights of these Action Role Playing Games and the moment to moment gameplay isn’t for the faint of heart.  For the most part, those games have been cut from the same cloth.  The worlds they’ve built are grand in their own right, but not necessarily on the scale of a modern open world game.   So while the idea sounded great, it was hard to imagine that Soulsborne formula in an open world setting.Let me alleviate any concerns you might have.  They nailed it.  This is absolutely a Breath of the Wild moment for the Dark Souls franchise.  Maybe franchise isn’t the right word, the games which spawned from Dark Souls perhaps is a better way to put it.  From Software has built something special here in terms of open world games, something that we haven’t seen in the fantasy RPG genre in quite some time, they’ve taken all the things that people love from all of their different games and stuffed it into an absolutely massive world that’s just filled to the brim with content.  We had the game for two weeks and certainly haven’t seen all there is to see, but what we did see was so very impressive.  Not just by From Software game standards, but from the standards set by other open world games and game makers.  Prepare to be overwhelmed.  From Software pulls no punches in Elden Ring and regardless of the naming conventions, this is open world Dark Souls for better or worse.  Look, if you like open world games, dense experiences with a ton of things to do and see, AND you enjoy From Software titles, this is it.   Read no further and just jump in.If not, or you aren’t quite clear on what that means — Souls games are challenging, a little bit obscure, they’ve got great combat and ton of items to find. In Elden Ring you can certainly see some influences from all of their games, and it might be the most narratively interesting one of them all. You play as a character called the Tarnished, and in your role as the hero in this tale you are exploring a world called The Lands Between and are tasked to take down the Elden Lords.  Ultimately this story will twist and turn so let’s not get into too many specifics as to spoil anything.  It’s filled with surface area to explore, dungeons, castles, mountaintops, swamps… and any other fantasy trope you can think of.  This world is full of life, mostly hostile, and they’re looking to hinder your progress.  And that progress is gated by runes instead of souls. Get killed and you lose your progress.  Get back to your place of death before dying again, and you can regain that progress.  It’s a mechanic that’s made these games some of the most interesting in the last decade.  They are hard and rewarding.  You’ll die a lot.  It’s part of the fun, overcoming the many, many obstacles that From Software can throw in your way.  No hand holding, you’re going to have to tough through some trying times to see all there is to see in Elden Ring.  The sense of accomplishment for persevering through the tough battles, the missteps, the cheap shots when you’re at low health, they are all part of the “fun”.  What From did in their previous efforts and what they do better than most is really make the world feel connected, while you feel like you’re getting stronger and more capable.  In the open world setting it’s just amazing how it translates over. If you’ve played one, you’ve certainly played them all, though the mechanics are slightly different this time around and we’ve never seen something this massive in any of their games.As noted, the currencies are different but largely the same.  Bonfires are replaced by Sites of Grace, and the different weapon upgrade tools are called smithing stones instead of mineral slabs.  These core mechanics make for the base of the game.  Get stronger and those enemies you found in the cavern tucked away on the map that kicked your ass get a little easier.  You’ll still need to learn patterns, use crowd control tactics, and utilize all the new abilities that you find a long the way.  You can do this as just about any character archetype that you can dream of, and the character customization and build options as the game gets going is as good as ever.  These builds vary greatly from full blown wizards with arcane skills to brute warriors and everything in between.  Though you’re not tied to one thing in particular in Elden Ring, but you will be somewhat restricted in the early goings depending on what you select. There’s a nice sense of progression though, and the game allows you to explore quite a bit without fencing you in from the get go.  What really makes the open world work is the introduction of transportation and that’s your trusty horse Torrent.  You’ll pick up this companion early on, and the combat on four legs is quite fun.  Making exploration less tiresome than it might be if it wasn’t in there.  And there’s certainly a lot of the game, including boss battles that was meant for using the horse which is an interesting take on the mechanic.  The horse and it’s leaping ability will allow you to explore areas you might not think you can get to.  It’s not quite Skyrim with a horse walking up the side of a mountain, but there’s plenty of places ol’ Torrent can get you to.Out in the open world, you really are treated to some incredible sights and sounds.  The world is varied and interesting and just begs to be explored.  The day night cycle and weather effects are just beautiful on the pc build we played.  Once we started we just wanted to see what was off in the distance.  The Erdtree looming over everything with its golden glow.  A castle in the distance and wondering what sinister battle awaited.  If just for the goodies tucked away in each and every new area that you come to there’s good reason to keep your eyes peeled for the glowing embers of a corpse that needs to be pillaged.  Wide varied as it may be, there is somewhat of a formulaic approach to the multi-region map.  You’ve got caves to go hunting for stones and crafting materials.  You’ve almost always got one or more dungeons tucked away in the recesses of the map.  There are towns and shacks where you’ll meet cryptic NPCs who have a story to tell, a quest to go on, or wares to sell you.  There are very few open world games that really give you that sense of wonder, Elden Ring delivers it.  Interesting locales off in the distance beg for you to come closer and more often than not you can get there.  The Souls series have long had these awesome backdrops to the dastardly hard levels and areas in the game, in many ways Elden Ring feels like you can just go there and see what’s going on.  Usually that’s going to be just a bunch of baddies ready to take your lunch money, but the allure of items, weapons, and more are certainly hard to turn away from.Some of the new systems are quite good.  The crafting system is certainly welcome, allowing you to harvest materials out in the world to build items on the fly.  Things like firebombs, antidotes and more can simply be made when you need them instead of needing to find them in the world or at a vendor.  The Flask of Wondrous Physick allows you to concoct potions which you can take alongside your HP and FP Cerulean Flasks to as the name denotes “wonderous” effects.  These can be any number of things, but you’ll need to find items out in the world which’ll give you more options.  Hunting them down at the foot of different trees throughout the game will give you a nice start.New features are great, but the combat is still the star of the show here.  It hasn’t been changed all that much from Souls games to be fair.  The systems there weren’t broken, but there are some new things to master.  This includes a more agile feeling in combat with easier jumping mechanics and the ability to use spirit ashes that allow you to summon different creatures to your aid.  The starting ashes you get that introduce you to the system are a pack of wolves, but you can get all sorts of ghostly followers to help you on your journey.  And speaking of help, the summon system is still very much a thing here.  You can summon NPC characters or other players to help you in particularly tough battles.  It more or less feels like it has in all the previous Souls games.  And you might need it, more than once.  Elden Ring has some of the most difficult boss encounters that we’ve seen from From Software and some truly inspired designs.  From a fight with an absolutely humongous Fire Giant who towers above a massive open area, and array of dragons and just so many different types of creations here,  there’s just a lot of variety in the  things you’ll encounter.  You can certainly feel some of the influence from George R.R. Martin.  You can’t help but think of some great Game of Thrones moments and think that they weren’t the inspiration.  With that said, the story bits are still kinda From Software-esque in that things can be vague and left up to interpretation. From Software has a low bar to hurdle in this regard and they do so, but not all ends are tightly tied up when it comes to story beats, though it’s better than we’ve seen in other games from them.In our playthrough some of this was marred by the aforementioned issues talked about at the top of this review.  Those issue were many, but everything else is so good that even with those game-breaking problems I wanted to press on.  And not because it was something that we have to do or some reviewer’s duty or something like that, it was because I was genuinely enjoying my time with this game except for those frustrating moments.  Even without these issues, Elden Ring is going to frustrate. In some cases it might break players down in that an Open World affords these developers a shear wealth of opportunity, and they’ve already got a penchant for taking players to task routinely.  There’s no shortage of rage inducing moments in Elden Ring.  That said, it’s not going to be for everyone. Beautiful as it may be, there’s is certainly a darker side to the game and there aren’t any options to customize difficulty if you just want to see the sights and sounds.  For those that really dig into it though, there’s a ton here and we haven’t even gotten started with the online aspects — which include invasions, as well as competitive and cooperative multiplayer.  Unfortunately we didn’t have a chance to check that stuff out, but these modes have worked in the past so hopefully there aren’t huge issues at launch and if there are that they get ironed out quickly.  Nevertheless there’s so much to keep players busy if that is in fact the case.Elden Ring might be the best open world RPG in the last decade and right up there with Red Dead Redemption for peak of what we’ve seen from the open world genre itself.  It’s so, so good on the presentation front, the combat is spot on once again, the bosses, incredible and it continues to pull you deeper and deeper into the world as a good game should.  It’s going to give players 100+ hours just to see what the offline component has to offer.  From Software upped the ante, surpassing even their best efforts that we saw with Sekiro Shadows Die Twice in terms of world building.  Elden Ring is an absolute must-play game for 2022, but set aside some time and some patience.This game was reviewed using a copy of the game provided by the game's publisher,public relations company, developer or other for the express purpose of a review.

Elden Ring,Josh Wise,VideoGamer,https://www.videogamer.com/reviews/elden-ring-review/," Posted in Reviews
The new game by FromSoftware, Elden Ring, is a relaxing jaunt, set in a weather-warmed and prosperous kingdom, and you play a gentle sort, with a circle of good friends, a passion for horticulture, and… Oh, hang on. No, sorry. Let me try again: The new game by FromSoftware, Elden Ring, is a depressing and brutal action-R.P.G., set in a kingdom that has cracked and sloped into decrepitude, and you play a solitary figure, referred to as Tarnished, who is schooled in the ways of endless pain. There. That’s more like it.Elden Ring is the fruit of a collaboration between FromSoftware, led by director Hidetaka Miyazaki, and George R. R. Martin. Miyazaki is known for his scornful relationship to traditional narrative, preferring instead to bestrew his games with half-broken clues, and leave us to piece the events together and come to our own conclusions. Martin, meanwhile, is known for his scornful relationship to publishing. His most famous work is A Song of Ice and Fire, a series of fantasy books (from which sprang Game of Thrones) whose last two volumes have yet to thaw. There are long nights, I’m sure, on which Martin wishes he could do a Miyazaki: forget finishing the plot, get it out there in shards—a shipwrecked sentence here, a crumbling paragraph there—through which your reader can sift and sort. It’s not surprising the partnership appealed to him. But what’s in it for Miyazaki, whose games are hardly short of thrones, both vacant and vilely filled, and whose command of mythology—of its wearying weight, along with its capacity, when wielded properly, to prick us into awe—isn’t exactly in need of heavyweight help?Well, a name, for one, and with it a legion of fans who may not be familiar with the studio’s wintry corpus. Good news for them: Elden Ring may be the friendliest of FromSoftware’s catalogue to those who play less for the challenge, and more to bask in the tightly calibrated bleakness that only this studio is capable of producing. One reason for this is its lack of linearity. It’s an open world, and you have a horse. Rather, you have a “spectral steed,” called Torrent, which manifests in an ectoplasmic shimmer, and is upholstered with a dark hide, a silver mane, and horns. Think Seabiscuit, back from the dead after having been seriously bad.Naturally, being equipped with a horse, in a place like this, behooves you to explore; and when you do, taking in the landscape at a bracing lick, a number of other games thunder into view. There is Shadow of the Colossus, in which another rider, bent to a similarly fell ambition, hurtled across dun fields, between fists of wind-battered rock. Then, there is The Legend of Zelda, on which Elden Ring gleefully feasts. The environmental detail here, laid with Kubrick-like care, tells of past calamities and the rusted mechanisms of war, but so, too, does it provide the basis of a story. A golden force, scattered in pieces; a royal woman, sylphlike and powerful; a bestial foe; and, enchained to all three, a lowly hero, graced with purpose. Link should call his lawyer.Not that there is much chance of confusing Elden Ring with The Legend of Zelda. One look at FromSoftware’s setting, with its globs of pelting rain and its sunlight, breaking through clayey skies, and you could be looking at the work of no other developer. But where the influence of Nintendo’s series—specifically, the game that started it all, in 1986—is most potent is in the way it strops, and honours, your curiosity. No quarter of the map is bereft of secrets. Some of them, indeed, are devilish to spot. At one point, I read a note left near a wall by a fellow-player (the online functionality, as in Dark Souls and Bloodborne, allows you to sow other peoples’ worlds with passive hints and teases) that said, “Try attacking.” Sure enough, at the clang of a sword the wall melted away, divulging a hidden passage. Moments like this have occurred in games past, but only here, rooted in the soil of an open-world fantasy did it put me in mind of those strategies, polluted with half-truths, that were passed around the playground.Of course, there is nothing in the main quest of Elden Ring—no solutions so opaque—that would warrant a peeved call to the Nintendo Power Line. Progress lies in all directions, it’s your own to make, and, what’s more, it isn’t codified—no mission-tracking menus, no objective markers, and, unlike Assassin’s Creed, no G.P.S.-assisted auto-gallop. In short, nothing to leech the feeling of free-range, organic adventure. No thrill is potted, except for one, but that came from a talking pot, who told me about a festival of combat in a far-off place—“I’d heard whispers of such festivities”—and gave me nothing but the name of a castle; he concluded our encounter by saying, “Doesn’t the notion set your breast aflutter!” and it felt as if FromSoftware were nudging us into the realisation that it will always be the whisper, not the waypoint, that stirs our wonder.The location in which our struggles unfurl is called The Lands Between, a suitably purgatorial title—and a nod to the creative partnership that wrought them. Readers of Martin should keep their ears tuned to the names: Limgrave, Liurnia of the Lakes, Raya Lucaria, and Caelid. That last one is like a smoker’s lung: stuck in a permanent smoulder, with cliffs as red as clotted blood, and formations of stone that resemble ashen capillaries. It brings to mind the Hunter’s Nightmare, from Bloodborne, in which familiar streets were given an ossified makeover. But note, as well, the wall demarcating its border, and the fiery glow that wells between the stones, as though Hadrian had to contend with dragons; that image is purest Martin, in its melding of history and make-believe.And so to the other side of the game’s forging: the combat, to which FromSoftware fans are endlessly drawn. The clashes in Elden Ring are best compared to those of Dark Souls: swords, shields, parries, or, if it sets your breast aflutter, sorcery builds instead. Unlike the breathless Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, we are back with a stamina meter, in need of constant tending, and the difficulty, while comparatively low as you roam the wilds, spikes considerably for the game’s boss fights. These are a fun-loving bunch, headed up by a group of demigods, the first of which is a fellow known as Godrick The Grafted, due to his hobby of Shelleyan body augmentation—personally, I think he interpreted the phrase “take up arms” a little too literally. On the whole, this is not the most patience-fraying of FromSoftware’s games, but the studio’s helplessly devoted (I count myself in their sorry ranks) will find their appetites sated.What an odd relationship between developer and audience, one of cruelty and pleasure, steeped in the slow trickle of progress. There are no other dynamics quite like it in games; they acquaint us with an array of miseries and charge us money for the privilege. It will be keenly understood, however, by readers of George R. R. Martin, who are well versed in cruelty, violence, and the agony of the long wait. In Elden Ring, FromSoftware offers us an open world with a rich and heady history, yours for the exhuming. Or not. Whether you’re a lore junky or you simply crave a fight, this is a game with such a potently present tense that hours stream by without your noticing—so fast is the seal of its mood. “I never knew the guidance bestowed upon us Tarnished had such fantastic roots,” one character says. “Although, it’s all a bit much for me, in truth. I’m still looking for my own purpose.” Start looking now.Developer: FromSoftwarePublisher: Bandai Namco EntertainmentAvailable on: PlayStation 5 [reviewed on], PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PCRelease Date: February 25, 2022To check what a review score means from us, click here.

Elden Ring,Jay Henningsen,GamesBeat,https://venturebeat.com/2022/02/23/elden-ring-is-a-brilliant-monument-to-fromsoftwares-legacy/,"Connect with top gaming leaders in Los Angeles at GamesBeat Summit 2023 this May 22-23. Register here.Elden Ring has nearly everything I ever wanted from a Souls game. It’s chock full of additions, improvements, and inclusions from other FromSoftware titles that are likely to please most players. In particular, both your character being able to jump vertically and having access to a mount that can run fast and perform a double-jump truly let you experience the three-dimensional level design FromSoftware is known for in ways that weren’t previously possible.Elden Ring also has some things I could do without. At times I think it tries a little too hard to include new features. Over the course of your playthrough, you’ll find so many different and often disconnected systems at play, it’ll make you wonder if they actually left any features out or just included every idea the designers had.Personal quibbles aside, Elden Ring is still the best game I’ve played in a long time, and I already know I’m going to sink hundreds of hours into it well after I see the credits.Combat has always been central to FromSoftware games, and Elden Ring builds upon and improves the core experience previously found in Demon’s Souls and the Dark Souls trilogy. I’m sorry, Sekiro and Bloodborne fans; this is very much a Souls game, with the slower-paced, more deliberate, and defensive combat style that typically brings.GamesBeat Summit 2023Join the GamesBeat community in Los Angeles this May 22-23. You’ll hear from the brightest minds within the gaming industry to share their updates on the latest developments.One new feature that I love is the inclusion of guard counters. You no longer have to time a button press to parry with your shield. Now, an enemy attack bouncing off of your shield or a two-handed weapon in the guard position gives you a window to launch a heavy counterattack by pressing R2 immediately after. If this attack lands, it does high damage and often leaves normal, non-boss enemies in a kneeling position, ready for a critical strike R1 follow-up. This gives you a reliable way to dispatch enemies and makes it a little easier on players who prefer a more defensive style, like one of my favorites: the sword and spear combo. And before you assault me with cries of “easy mode,” these guard counters are not foolproof or without risk. Nimble enemies are capable of dodging these, since they are usually slower, heavy attacks, and if you miss, your enemy is likely to take a swing at you in return. As is often the case in Souls games, it’s still about learning which strategies work with which enemies. Jumping, aside from adding greatly to exploration, also gives you more options in combat as well. First, and most importantly, jumping does give your character iframes (also known as invincibility frames) — a small time during the animation when you can’t be hit by enemy attacks. In my experience, the time you are invincible while jumping is shorter than the time you are invincible during rolling, but I encourage everyone to perform their own experiments. Second, jumping attacks do more damage to your enemy’s poise (their resistance to being stun-locked by repeated attacks) and their Super Armor, a hidden stat carried over from the Dark Souls games that represents their resistance to getting knocked into a staggered state which leaves them vulnerable to critical hits. Jumping attacks also frequently have their own animations and attack patterns as well. For example, a jumping spear attack may allow you to stab downward at your target.The third important addition is mounted combat. Once you progress the story to the point that you unlock your trusty steed, you can run though groups of soldiers like a madman, swinging your weapon in sort of a medieval drive-by attack. Weapons have unique attacks in this mode too; spears can be held forward for a time like you’re jousting, while you may drag that big sword of yours on the ground for a bit, doing damage to anything it contacts. While you can only use your mount in the overworld areas, you still have plenty of opportunities to play out all of your knight fantasies. In fact, the developers intentionally designed a few of the boss fights around your character being in the saddle.To reappropriate a quote from sci-fi humorist Douglas Adams, “Elden Ring is big. Really big.” It dwarfs all of the previous FromSoftware games. It takes the core design principle from Dark Souls of being able to see something in the distance and eventually visit it and turns it up to eleven. You can rejoice at the fact that knee-high walls will no longer impede your movement or desire for exploration. Jump over that wall. Climb that mountain. Pick some flowers. Stare way too long at that entrancingly beautiful glowing tree in the distance. Elden Ring empowers you to explore every nook and cranny of its world — and explore you should.I’m also happy to report that this big, open world is full of interesting things to see and do. Even big, flat areas often have groups of patrolling enemies or even more intriguing set encounters like giant creatures pulling an oversized cart. The top of a certain hill may constantly get struck with lightning bolts that present both a danger and an opportunity to gather specific materials. Numerous enemy encampments force you to stop and plan your attack. Hidden caves and mines abound, most with their own unique mini-boss at the end. And nearly every single one of these things are worth exploring and completing, as they frequently reward items needed for upgrades to weapons and other items in your repertoire.In fact, I’d recommend exploring as much as you can. The upgrades you find will make your life a lot easier in the long run. Since the game doesn’t physically block your progression into later zones most of the time, enterprising and brave players should seriously consider venturing into those more difficult areas earlier than the game leads you there. A quick dash in and out on your mount can let you snag some very useful items that will help keep you ahead of the difficulty curve a bit. Being able to loot items while both in the saddle and running is incredibly useful, and most ground loot is easy to see by the glowing light emanating from it.The addition of a sneak mechanic also assists with getting in and out of tight places. Simply clicking the left analog stick causes your character to crouch and walk slowly, similar to Sekiro. Unlike in Sekiro, though, you have no idea or indication that the enemy has seen you until they actually react and move towards you. You can indeed let sleeping giants (or bears) lie on several occasions by sneaking in quietly to grab the loot right next to them. Sneaking is also helpful when attacking enemy outposts. If you sneak up behind an enemy undetected, you can backstab them for a critical strike, which is often a one-hit kill. The game even gives you the opportunity to sneak by large enemies in enclosed dungeon scenarios, which I tried whenever possible. In Elden Ring, you don’t always have to kill everything or sprint through the level with a train of 20 enemies chasing you. In my opinion, the enemies are a little too blind, and their detection radius is a little too small, but since that’s the way they made the game, I’m sure going to take advantage of it.Dark Souls fans are used to the games not really explaining anything or giving explicit objectives. While Elden Ring does start with more exposition and story than most of the previous games, it’s also still obtuse at times — almost painfully so. More so than the previous titles, Elden Ring frequently locks story progression and crucial systems and upgrades behind conversations with NPCs who inhabit the game. So, please take this as friendly advice: If you’re ever not sure what to do or where to go, visit all of the NPCs you’ve met thus far, and see if they have any additional conversation options. At one point, I even visited the very first NPC I met, way back outside the starting area, and he had some helpful information for me. Most of the time, though, the game doesn’t do a good job of leading you to these conversations naturally — you just sort of have to keep checking from time to time.With that caveat in mind, Elden Ring does give you a fair amount of things to do and explore. Somewhat surprisingly, it even sometimes marks specific destinations on your map for you. More frequently, though, you’ll just have a conversation with an NPC, and they’ll ask you to find a specific person or venture to a specific place. Once you get there, you tend to either pick up an item or just trigger a part of the story that unlocks new conversations. Because I’m terrible at remembering the details of conversations, I found myself unlocking things without knowing I unlocked them until I spoke to the right person. So again, keep talking to people if you want to progress.In terms of the main questline, Elden Ring keeps you moving in the correct general direction by way of glowing lines that emanate from the Sites of Grace (this game’s version of Dark Souls’ bonfires). These point you to the next closest Site of Grace. If you progress through these in order, they’ll keep you moving toward the primary story goals.Weapons now come in two basic types: normal and special. Upgrading a normal weapon requires one type of smithing stone to upgrade, and special weapons (these are the unique weapons with built-in special effects) require a different type. Good riddance to needing different materials for different damage or scaling affinities (fire, sacred, heavy, keen, etc.). Once you level up a weapon, it stays at that level. In place of leveling each weapon down a particular set path like in previous games, you now have Ashes of War. These allow you to accomplish two things: First, they let you change a weapon’s special attack (usually performed by holding L2 while two-handing the weapon) to any special attack you have both found the Ashes of War for and that fits the weapon type. The second thing you can do is change the affinity of a weapon based on the Ashes you assign to it. For example, I found a Sacred Blade Ashes of War which not only allowed me to change the special attack to casting a spell that imbued my weapon with Holy Energy for a short period of time, but it also allowed me to switch the permanent affinity of the weapon to Sacred. This made it do extra Holy damage that scaled with my Faith stat. And perhaps the best part about this: You can swap out Ashes of War and change affinities any time you visit the blacksmith. No more wasted upgrade materials for trying out different weapons with different affinities.Another thing I really had fun with were the Spirit Summons. These are items you can obtain that summon spectral friends to help you in difficult fights. They’re sort of an on-demand NPC summons with the restriction that you can only use them in certain places. If you ever see an icon that looks like a tombstone appear on the center-left side of your screen, that’s the game telling you Spirit Summons are available. Some of these summons are more useful than others. My favorites were the Fanged Imps, which had both ranged attacks and vicious melee weapons that made enemies bleed, and the Lone Wolves, which summons a trio of agile beasts that jump and run all over the place while furiously biting enemies.The last thing I’d like to mention is that, in addition to all weapons having a special attack now, all of the various spells (sorceries and incantations) in the game now have a special “charge” ability. This makes it more powerful in a way unique to that spell. If you hold down the button you use to cast the spell, it makes do more damage or add additional effects. For example, the Rejection incantation (which normally just produces a small knockback effect) can throw an enemy combatant off of their mount when fully charged. The really great thing about charging a spell is that it doesn’t cost any more FP to use. The tradeoff, of course, is it takes longer to cast, which can sometimes be to your detriment when you’re in a close combat situation.On a personal note, I really wish the in-game help included a list of the various status icons that appear under your health, stamina, and FP bars. I played for over 50 hours on one character that had a completely unexplained red box with a down arrow that I only found out was some sort of persistent HP debuff after I unequipped everything and started comparing my current stats to the base stats shown on the level up screen. I still have zero idea where I got this from or why it stayed with me the entire game.Elden Ring also has a crafting system. While this is usually an expected staple for modern RPGs, I don’t feel like it added much other than providing a cheap and easy way to obtain the item needed for co-op multiplayer. Yes, you can make things like arrows and poison cures, but more often than not, I found myself just buying these. Arrows, in particular, require animal bones and feathers (if you want to actually fletch the arrows), and I just didn’t have the patience to amass these. It was much faster for me to just kill some things that gave me more runes (Elden Ring’s version of souls from Dark Souls — the currency you gain and lose frequently by dying) and buy a pile of arrows from a vendor. Aside from the various animal parts, though, the various plants and herbs are plentiful and easy to gather, and they respawn whenever you fast travel or rest at a Site of Grace. I’m sure some people will appreciate this system, but I didn’t.Another thing that fell flat for me was the Flask of Wondrous Physick. This is a single-use potion you can customize with various effects which include restoring health and FP, temporary stat increases, and even creating explosions. To me, this seemed more gimmicky than anything else, and I only used it once during my time with the game. The rest of the time, I usually just didn’t bother with it.Finally, the Great Runes, although important to the story, seemed like they could’ve used some more thought. Not only do you have to defeat major bosses to obtain these, but you also have to complete quests to unlock them before you can equip them. And even when you equip them, you can’t actually use them without expending a rare and expensive consumable item. And once you use them, you lose the effects if you die. While I do see the value in the powerful boosts these give you, the game almost made me afraid to use them, especially right after I got the first one, for fear of making a dumb yet costly mistake.My nitpicking aside, Elden Ring has absolutely given me more enjoyment than I’ve had with a game in a long while, and it has edged out the Demon’s Souls remake for my favorite game on the PlayStation 5. It even looks almost as good as Demon’s Souls, though I do understand why the developer had to reign in the level of detail just a bit because Elden Ring is many times larger and has much more visible on the screen at any given time.Maybe I’m just becoming jaded by all the games lately that I think were overhyped and then underdelivered, but Elden Ring is a rare example of a game that grabbed ahold me and won’t let go. I’m joyfully exploring every inch of the land and delighting in my discoveries, and I don’t see myself stopping any time soon.

Please try again  Score: 9/10Reviewed on: PlayStation 5 and Windows PC (also available for Xbox One/Series S/X, PlayStation 4)Developer: FromSoftwarePublisher: Bandai Namco  TL;DR: An open world game for FromSoftware fans rather than a FromSoftware game for open world fans. Elden Ring is indisputably top notch fantasy role-playing. However, like most FromSoftware games, it requires players to heavily indulge their masochistic tendencies — assuming they have some. For those late to the party, Tokyo-based FromSoftware has become synonymous with truly punishing interactive entertainment, thanks to its Dead Souls series, Bloodborne, and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. We’re talking loss of progress upon death, bosses that may take you days to figure out how to beat, and enigmatic items and upgrade systems that require plenty of noodling and experimentation to properly understand and exploit. Elden Ring bears all these hallmarks and is built around a sword and sorcery combat engine that demands precision and rewards tactical thinking. It also has FromSoftware’s signature multiplayer elements, including the ability to summon other players for help against bosses (this isn’t cheating — it’s sanity preservation), invade or be invaded by other players, and leave and view text messages within the world that may help or trick those who read them. Add in the developer’s typically nebulous style of storytelling — they allegedly teamed up with fantasy author George R. R. Martin for the narrative, but I found none of the star scribe’s distinctive fingerprints in the writing or world-crafting — and you have a pretty familiar-feeling action RPG. Where it deviates from the FromSoftware formula is its absolutely enormous, free-to-explore world. Most of the Japanese game maker’s romps are set in much smaller, intricately crafted, wondrously labyrinthine environments that have players tiptoeing around, fearing enemy encounters around every corner while looking for hidden paths and shortcuts. Elden Ring‘s world is gigantic by comparison and even allows for spectral horse riding to shorten the trudge between distant locations. The good news is that the designers looked at the open world concept from a fresh perspective. This is not a game of fetch quests and go-here-and-kill-this-many-goblins style tasks. It instead embraces the notion of true exploration, providing a world full of mysterious ruins, artifacts and magical manifestations that are rarely less than enthralling to discover and investigate. And yet, if I’m to pick a nit, I found my time spent in the open world ranked second to venturing into the game’s many keeps and dungeons. These areas are much more like a traditional FromSoftware game, where every step forward is filled with tension and dread and slowly forging a path through maze-like corridors creates its own special kind of satisfaction. Elden Ring is neither a step forward nor backward for the famed developer, but rather a shift to the side. It’s a different kind of FromSoftware game, one that mixes stampeding mounted combat in a vast world with more intimate, terrifying moments in dark caves and cramped castles. I’m having a grand time with it, make no mistake, but it’s not my favourite FromSoftware game to date.  Score: 8/10Reviewed on: PlayStation 5 (Also available for PlayStation 4)Developer: Polyphony DigitalPublisher: SIE TL;DR: An old-school racer with modern trim. I’m old enough to have adult memories of playing the original Gran Turismo on PlayStation One (back then we just called it PlayStation), and this latest entry honours the esteemed racer’s quarter-century heritage. Its collection of hundreds of beautifully detailed real-world rides is once again the star of the show. These cars behave with exceptional authenticity, giving geeky gearheads the ability to fine tune every little thing about each machine’s engine and performance characteristics. And we’re taught to handle our automobiles through a series of increasingly difficult driving licence tests that teach us everything from how to take a hairpin turn to stopping on a dime. And unlike many modern racing games set in free-to-roam worlds, Gran Turismo 7 is perfectly confident in providing us with a limited set of closed circuit tracks cribbed from real-world locales. These courses are gradually unlocked as we work our way through a series of events designed to help build out our car collections — cutely spurred on via tasks presented on restaurant-style menus, where we learn about each auto in a manner akin to reading the details of a delicious dish. There are a couple of notable bumps in the road, though. As with previous Gran Turismo games, it’s oddly easy to upgrade a ride to make it so overpowered that you’ll likely be able to breeze through most races in its class, which greatly reduces the challenge. I recommend adjusting difficulty parameters — especially driver AI — to higher levels than you normally would for a racing game. Plus, while the cars are photorealistic in presentation, some of the background environments and architecture pale in comparison to what we’ve seen in Microsoft’s rival Forza Motorsport series — though, to be fair, you’ll likely have your eyes on your car and the road rather than the scenery most of the time. Long story short, Gran Turismo 7 is a bit of a throwback to the genre’s early days — and includes some of the series’ old shortcomings — but when it comes to accurate driving physics and sheer, unadulterated love of cars, it’s something close to peerless.  Score: 4/10Reviewed on: Xbox Series X (Also available for Xbox One/Series S, PlayStation 4/5, Windows PC)Developer: Piranha BytesPublisher: THQ Nordic TL;DR: Come for the jetpacking fun, leave because of everything else. Boy, did THQ Nordic pick the wrong time to release a deeply mediocre open world game. The sequel to 2017’s equally middling Elex, this sci-fi RPG once again stars Jax, the unlikely focal point around which a whole lot of crises seem to be taking place. The biggest of these is the alien invasion of Magalan, a once advanced planet now existing in apocalyptic stupor following a century-old meteor strike. It has all the pieces of an enticing adventure, including a big and often beautiful world to freely explore (once you sufficiently upgrade your belt-mounted jetpack, vertical traversal becomes the game’s main draw), loads of tasks and quests to complete, and expansive character and equipment upgrade and crafting systems. There’s dozens of hours of content here, potentially providing plenty of bang for your gaming buck. Alas, it’s all fraying at the edges. The story is clunky and disorienting thanks to a mix of uneven writing, wooden acting and overlapping quests that break narrative continuity. Ugly character models are made even worse by combat and conversation animations that are at times laughably awkward by modern standards. Melee battle is often a button-mashing mess, filled with floaty physics and attacks that seem to land or miss at random (ranged combat is marginally better). And the menu system is so plain it feels as though the art department had virtually no input — and yet it somehow still manages to be weirdly difficult to navigate with any efficiency. This may have stood a minor chance in the bone dry days of summer, but with so many truly remarkable open world experiences currently on offer at the moment, it’s tough to see why anyone would opt for Elex II.  Score: 8.0/10Reviewed on: PlayStation 5 (Also available for PlayStation 4, Xbox One/Series S/X, Windows PC)Developer: BungiePublisher: Bungie TL;DR: The best Destiny campaign in a long while. Plus: Glaives! Just when I thought I was out, Bungie pulls me back in. Despite having what I consider to be the best first-person shooter mechanics going, Destiny 2‘s muddled and multifarious sci-fi lore and convoluted-to-the-point-of-being-off-putting loot and growth systems have gradually made me lose interest. I skipped the last expansion (Beyond Light) completely. It’s the first one I missed. But I reluctantly decided to give The Witch Queen a go, and darned if Bungie’s game hasn’t gotten its hooks back into me. First off, the new campaign is great. Set primarily inside a colourful realm called the Throne World, it has real drama thanks to a fantastic antagonist in the form of the titular villain whose motives are at least understandable, if not necessarily relatable. She’s managed to get a sect of ghosts — those little balls that follow the players’ avatars around and revive them when they die — to take up with her, meaning some of the more powerful foes you encounter will respawn shortly after you kill them unless you crush their little metal helpers in your gauntleted hand first. I was invested in seeing this story through. Second, we’ve been given some fun new things to do in the player hubs, including the ability to build glaives — a gratifyingly powerful new category of weapon that straddles ranged and melee combat— and then go on to craft custom weapons. These elements successfully reignited my interest in upgrading my Titan’s arsenal. I’m admittedly still a bit lost when it comes to how all of the upgrade systems, subclasses, and secondary objectives and tasks work. And I’m sad that — as usual — I’ll miss out on the new raid mission for lack of being able to schedule a big team of friends to get together for multi-hour play sessions. But perhaps this is just the cost of doing business as a casual Destiny player. All I know is that I’ve been given ample reason to head out and shoot robots and aliens big and small with a wonderful array of satisfying weapons. And that’s enough to get me to put another couple dozen hours into Bungie’s addictive looter shooter.

Now that the game is finally here, the answer has two parts:Platforms: PC (reviewed), PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S
Price: $60
Release Date: February 25, 2022
Genre: Action/RPGElden Ring is a game of contrasts. It invites you in with a huge world to explore, then punishes you if you stray too far from the next story point. It subtly hints where you should go next, but the critical path might be too tough if you haven’t thoroughly plumbed the surrounding area. It tries to be more accessible than previous From games, then puts up massive roadblocks early on. Series veterans know what they’re in for, but newcomers may find this game even tougher to get into than previous Souls titles.For the most part, I enjoyed my time with Elden Ring. But when frustration set in, it set in hard, from the finnicky mounted combat, to the paltry rewards, to the handful of perfection-or-death sections that get very repetitive, very quickly. On the other hand, these were usually worthwhile tradeoffs for the game’s graceful combat, nuanced character-building and general sense that the world had a lot of worthwhile secrets to find. Read on for our full Elden Ring review.It’s easy to describe what Elden Ring is, but harder to describe the exact experience of playing it. On a broad level, Elden Ring is an open-world action/RPG. You create a custom character, then set off to explore, fighting a variety of standard foes and menacing bosses along the way. You can discover new items and equipment; you can level up your attributes to get better at melee, ranged or magical combat; you can hop on horseback and explore the far reaches of the dark-fantasy Lands Between.Elden Rings is a deeply difficult experience. The flip side is that mastering the combat feels profoundly satisfying.If you’ve played a Souls game (or Bloodborne), then the moment-to-moment gameplay should feel intimately familiar at this point. Customizing your perfect character by distributing attributes and upgrading equipment is one part of the experience; mastering the satisfying and deadly combat is another.Like most From games, Elden Ring is a deeply difficult experience. Most enemies can kill you in a few hits; bosses generally need only one or two. Foes will swarm you from the front, or grab you from behind cover, or rise up out of the ground, or swoop down from above. Your healing options are limited, and nothing is instantaneous, from your melee attacks, to your magical projectiles, to your lifesaving dodges.The flip side is that mastering the combat feels both eminently fair and profoundly satisfying. Stats and numbers play a big role in your Elden Ring success, but so do your own skills, and you’ll naturally improve both as you play.You can upgrade your character and buy new gear with an all-purpose currency called Runes, which every enemy drops upon defeat. If you die, you get one chance to recover your runes; if you fail, they’re gone forever. This is as frustrating as it sounds, but it also provides a killer incentive to play carefully and consistently. However, the game is relatively stingy with Runes, even when enemy difficulty starts ramping up. Once you get past the initial areas, even scouring a whole level is usually not enough for a single level-up, which is doubly frustrating if you die and lose your Runes somewhere along the way. This design necessitates a lot of tedious grinding at reliable Rune spots.Like previous From games, there are also unobtrusive multiplayer elements, such as leaving messages for other adventurers, or summoning players to aid with boss fights. They’re a welcome way to mitigate some of Elden Ring’s more difficult moments.Elden Ring fires on all cylinders when you explore its castles, dungeons, catacombs and other enclosed areas. These areas feel essentially the same as they would in a Dark Souls game, challenging you to find every hidden path and shortcut, while keeping the overall environment somewhat constrained. If you search carefully, you can find everything there is to find.However, once you get out into the open world, everything feels just a little less polished. Sites of Grace (safe points, like Bonfires in previous games) sometimes — but not always — point the way to the next plot goal, but where you go beyond that is up to you. Some mini-dungeons and overland areas require considerably higher levels than their nearby narrative counterparts; others are valuable sources of items and experience, which you’ll need for upcoming plot bosses. Expect a lot of trial and error, as well as needless deaths.You’ll also be able to explore a lot of the world on horseback, which is a mixed bag. Your summonable steed, Torrent, moves quickly, and can double-jump. This opens up a lot of new avenues for exploration, but leads you to “was I really supposed to go there?” dead ends as often as not. Mounted combat is also a surprisingly chaotic experience as well, opting for unpredictable hit-and-run attacks rather than the finely tuned, methodical blows you find on foot. A handful of mounted boss fights, such as pursuing a fire-breathing dragon across an open field, are exhilarating. But they’re the exception, not the rule.Some dungeons are unbelievably well-hidden, and I wonder how many players will discover them without a walkthrough handy. Elden Ring’s open world straddles the line between “secretive” and “aimless,” and winds up on the wrong side a little too often.Acclaimed spec fic author George R.R. Martin helped write Elden Ring’s backstory, and his influence on the game is clear. The Lands Between are a rich, nuanced fantasy realm, with a complicated cast of characters and a sense that the status quo is anything but immutable.Elden Ring’s open world straddles the line between “secretive” and “aimless,” and winds up on the wrong side a little too often.Like many other From games, the specifics of the plot aren’t that important here, as the atmosphere and characters generally leave a bigger impression. Still, if you’re dying to know: The Elden Ring is a powerful artifact that split into four pieces after a devastating war called the Shattering. Four demigods each took a piece of the Ring, and each one became dark and twisted as a result. You play as a Tarnished: an immortal undead warrior who can defeat the demigods, reshape the ring and become an Elden Lord.As usual, From does an excellent job of cramming a lot of lore into sparse dialogue snippets, item descriptions and even the level design itself. But Elden Ring is a little easier to parse than other Souls games thanks to an area called the Roundtable Hold, where you can meet a variety of other adventurers and get small info dumps about the game’s major bosses. It’s a smart, optional idea that helps give every major boss fight clear and comprehensible stakes.Elden Ring is a gorgeous game, from the glowing golden leaves of distant Erdtrees, to the blood-flecked rings in a suit of armor. While it’s not the most graphically ambitious title out there (possibly because it has to straddle two console generations), it has a memorable art style, with suitably grotesque enemy designs and striking architecture in each level.The sound design is likewise strong, with music that tends to go big and bold for boss fights, but stay quiet otherwise. In keeping with the game’s subdued setting, the voice acting feels suitably off-kilter. Bandai Namco hasn’t released a voice cast list yet, but the actress behind the villainous Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon is a standout performer, capturing the character’s madness and malice.Elden Ring is not the perfect game that many Dark Souls fans probably hoped it would be. While adding open-world features to the beloved series formula results in a few cool moments, it also stretches the game in too many directions. If Dark Souls is a well-oiled grandfather clock, then Elden Ring is more like a smartwatch: full of features, but lacking some polish.Still, Elden Ring mostly accomplishes what it sets out to do. Dark Souls and open-world design aren’t a perfect marriage, but From manages the two together pretty well, providing an interesting world to explore and plenty of cool creatures to fight along the way. Just savor the big dungeons while they last; once you get back out onto the open field, there’s a lot of empty space between you and the next one.Elden Ring's first substantive DLC pack, the Free Colosseum Update, may entice PvP-minded players back to the game.Marshall Honorof is a senior editor for Tom's Guide, overseeing the site's coverage of gaming hardware and software.

Elden Ring,Ed Thorn,"Rock, Paper, Shotgun",https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-review,"""No spoilers here""For a moment, pretend you're an examiner marking FromSoftware games. Get that red biro ready. ""Tried jumping, didn't work"", you might pop by Dark Souls. ""Nothing but grief here"", you mark by Bloodborne. ""Time for crab"", you scribble across each one in a mad frenzy. You are so tired of the crabs. They aren't the most encouraging games, to say the least.But Elden Ring is different. Yes, it's an action-RPG that retains Souls' difficulty, but it's one that expands their labyrinthine worlds with a single offering that's dizzying in its scope. Perhaps most importantly, it's a world that encourages you to explore and wants you to win, even if its way of showing it is with a massive rock troll that wants to cave your face in. What Elden Ring provides is an adventure unlike anything else or anyone else's. An unmissable jaunt through one of, if not the most impressive open world to date. ""Visions of joy"" sums it up nicely.Like I said in my first Elden Ring preview, drill down into the game's core and you'll find that Souls heart pulsing away. You start by choosing from a number of preset classes, each steering you towards an early playstyle you can break away from later, if you so choose. I went for Hero, because they had stats closely mirroring that of a brainless Yakuza thug. More adventurous options are available, including battle priests and lithe prisoners. Of course, you can always pick the Wretch, a half-naked sod who I'm never brave enough to lock-in whenever their pale thighs grace my Souls character-select screen.The game feels like Souls too, from combat to exploration to interacting with NPCs. In the way your character creaks some double doors open or the duhnn sounds when you pick up glinting loot. From the outside looking in, then, it's easy to misplace Elden Ring in the Dark Souls 4 camp. Isn't it just Dark Souls, but bigger? No, not at all. The game borrows from Souls past, sure, but it's remarkably present. Elden Ring is an arrival of sorts, a generational shift away from the mould of old and into something that, well, only Elden Ring could provide.And that's an open world that hasn't buckled under the weight of its ambition. Instead, it never falters, delivering a mind-bending number of caverns to crack and cathedrals to cleanse. FromSoftware have stamped their signature richness on every locale, where even a quiet exploratory trot on your spectral steed seems deliberate, like an orchestrated respite teeing up several options: a towering fortress jutting out of a lake; a procession of undead milling around an encampment; a sequence of giant steps leading to a murky beyond; a sleeping dragon. Choose one, come back to the others later? That is, if you don't bump into something else.Oh, you'll stumble into a fine assortment of cursed creatures, that's for sure. And they carry the Souls baton with their disproportionately long limbs and boiled backs and flowing locks. Progression lies in razing their homes, stealing their souls, and pushing further into the fog of war. Each enemy has their place in this world too, though, I'm sure of it. What I mean by this is I don't have a chuffing clue what's going on in the story. But that's part of the allure of a Souls game. Info is drip-fed as you discover new locales, and clock environmental cues, decipher boss fights, and natter with forlorn NPCs. Confusion never leads to frustration, only curiosity.If you're in need of some direction, Graces act as glowing checkpoints that produce wispy trails in the breeze. Follow these golden markers and they'll lead you onto the next story beat. That's about as much handholding as Elden Ring deigns to offer you. Exploration is your business and your business alone. Despite appearances, though, the game's open world acts as an extension of support when you need it most. The challenges it sets before you aren't ever going to be easy, no way! But you have options – look at those Graces again. It's where they aren't blowing that makes the open world so brilliant. No longer are you chained to obstacles in your path. What path? You have many now. Go against the wind and see what's out there. Go probe other sections of the map and come back stronger and wiser and with a pair of bolt cutters. Then give it another crack.Encouragement is what sets this game apart from old Souls. Elden Ring's open world is vast and dense, but you can tell FromSoftware didn't build a sprawling map for the sake of it. Unlike some other open world games, Elden Ring's offering is tightly bound by a sense of purpose. Every discovery matters in some way, whether that's in pushing your character's stats up or gaining entry to a spooky academy over yonder. Remove one sliver and the way it's stitched together would mean the rest unraveling, probably into a pit of monstrous crawfish.While Elden Ring's open world is a blast, it's also a relentless blowtorch to your patience. You might stumble into the odd gruff NPC with a grudge and a basket on their head, but whatever that is on the hill over there wants to kill you. Rarely are you going to discover a new location with something that doesn't want to melt your skin into chippy fat. So, don't expect nice little towns bustling with life and cheery shopkeepers and canned cries of laughter. The only cries of laughter you'll get here are of the despairing variety, either from yourself or from said NPC with a basket on his head. This can grate if you're just not in the mood for misery, although the myriad of options helps to offset the pain and makes it the most accessible Souls yet.Options, options, you're probably thinking, ""This guy bangs on about options, doesn't he? Get a room."" Seriously, though. It's not just the open world that hits you with plenty of them. The combat may be very similar to Souls in the way you dodge, block, and swing, but there's a few new additions that steer you towards experimentation.Namely, Ashes Of War. These are special moves you can attach to weapons that can fundamentally change the way they operate too. For instance, one of my greatswords is now infused with blood, meaning I can perform a bloody slash that stacks a bleed debuff on enemies; at the cost of my own blood. That's a LOT of blood. But there's also no penalty to switching these moves out, so if I fancy something less self-destructive, I can do just that. It's...surprisingly nice? What I mean by this is I haven't been pursued by a three-eyed hog with razor blades for teeth yet.Even the ability to craft items lets you fill your pockets with useful things that'll get you out of a pinch. Elden Ring's world is filled with flowers to pick, mushrooms to pluck, and lots of rare meats (we're talking dragon hearts, not like, salami). All of which can be slapped together to make bombs, knives, and magical crease you can slather on your weapons. Cookbooks scattered around the lands will increase your repertoire too, presumably left by the final boss: Gordon Ramsey. Word on the grapevine is his final move is a big shout and two slices of ciabatta fly in from the sides and compress you to death.If you'd rather rely on a pair of extra hands, Elden Ring has your back. Given the right tools and the right spells, you can tinkle a bell and have some ghostly Pokémon fight by your side. Later on, there's a way of making them stronger. It's yet another way the game accommodates for solo players who'd like to ease the pressure slightly.That's the thing about Elden Ring, its open world has your back, in its own - often painful - way. Souls has always been about inching through claustrophobic corridors and bashing your skull against whatever's in the way. You compare foreheads with friends, ""Look at this bruise Barry, that's me five hours in"". And Barry would probably peel his hair back and reveal the exact same bruise. Adventures in past Souls games tend to line up, as you're all wandering down the same pathways. But that's not the case with Elden Ring. You might show your bruise to Barry and he'll peel his hair back to reveal a scar or a massive indent or a tattoo of a mouse tustling with a skeleton. Both of may be five hours in but you'll be on totally different trajectories. No matter how hostile the game's world may be, it pushes you to succeed and carve out your own adventures. It is, by far, the most encouraging Souls yet.You're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!

Elden Ring,David Flynn,GamingTrend,https://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/elden-ring-review-tarnished-glory/,"I’ll admit that I was skeptical the first time that I heard a Souls game was going open world. While, yes, previous entries did (mostly) allow you to explore at will, they still had a somewhat defined “correct” path of progression which you normally found by stumbling into an area and immediately dying if you hadn’t yet built your character up enough to survive. You then rinse and repeat until you’ve made progress via tiny increments.To my surprise Elden Ring, despite its large open world, still functions essentially the same. Each large area of the map seems tailored to what the developers assume the average player’s level will be upon reaching that area. There are basic enemies which, while hard and can still overwhelm quickly in large numbers, are relatively simple to take down with patience, along with a smattering of much harder enemies that may take players a few hours of leveling up to overcome. Thankfully, due to the open world design, players can easily sneak past most tough enemies and come back once better prepared.Each area is also densely populated with a large roster of unique boss battles, most of which are found off the beaten path and provide various important items, including those which can be used to upgrade your armaments, add new Skills, and more. Occasionally you’ll encounter a “main” boss, which typically has a short cut scene and features a much more in-depth battle than the optional bosses.  Technically, you can run straight to these bosses and avoid exploring the open world all together, but you’d be hard pressed to succeed without coming in prepared with at least a few Skills to experiment with, a decently high level, and better equipment than your base items. While there are large open world segments, there are also the claustrophobic dungeon areas we’ve come to expect from a Souls game, which helps break up the gameplay. This level of freedom has never been seen in a Souls game before and thankfully, it works (mostly).Story:The Elden Ring has been shattered and Queen Marika the Eternal is missing. Marika’s demigod offspring have all claimed the shards of the Elden Ring, which triggered the Shattering: a devastating event which has left The Lands Between in a state of despair. A war occurred, but with no clear victor. Then came you, once deceased, but now given new life as a Tarnished – a seeker of the Elden Ring and one who hopes to become the Elden Lord.As per usual, you will learn the story mainly through exploration. There are few cutscenes to speak of, save from a few boss introductions, otherwise you’ll learn via reading descriptions of in-game items and through visual cues provided by the areas you explore. While some may not enjoy this form of storytelling, I’ve always loved finding the lore hidden throughout the world and piecing together the backstories of those enemies I encounter. Elden Ring’s story is no different and still remains satisfying to unravel.The normally cryptic dialogue feels much more character focused now: each NPC you encounter has some sort of story you can choose to engage in, or kill them on the spot if you want some quick items. It doesn’t betray the storytelling style FromSoftware is known for, but rather explores an interesting new approach. Gameplay BasicsElden Ring is a souls game through and through, and features all the same mechanics you’re used to. After a brief opening area where you learn the basics of combat, you are thrust into the open world and left to fend for yourself. Immediately you’ll find a site of grace, Elden Ring’s version of the Dark Souls bonfire. Resting at a site of grace will restore your HP, FP, and cleanse you of any ailments along with refilling your flasks (Red and Blue for HP and FP). Like previous Souls entries, resting will also respawn most enemies. While resting at a site of grace you can pass time, memorize spells, level up, sort your chest, organize your flasks, equip ashes of war, and more. Most importantly, sites of grace on the critical path have a light which will guide you in the direction you need to go to progress.Organizing your flasks allows you to allocate how many flasks restore HP or FP, while Golden Seeds you find during exploration will create new flasks and Sacred Tears will upgrade the amount restored by each flask.  Ashes of War are the most unique aspect of Elden Ring, as they allow you to equip skills to your weapons which consume FP to perform. These skills are extremely powerful and change based on the weapon type. Early on Skills will absolutely help you overcome multiple bosses, and continue to remain vital throughout your playthrough.Early on you’ll be introduced to Melina, a Finger Maiden who will allow you to level up in exchange for runes, which you obtain by defeating enemies. Melina can be spoken to at any site of grace, allowing you to level up no matter which site of grace you stumble upon. Melina also provides you with the Spectral Steed Whistle which summons Torrent, your spirit horse – who is an absolute necessity when traversing The Lands Between.Speaking of traveling, sites of grace can be used as fast travel points, and with the extremely quick load times on both PC and PS5, this feature makes exploring The Lands Between a much less daunting experience. Simply selecting a site of grace from the map will transport you there within seconds and for areas far from a site of grace there are Stakes of Marika , typically near bosses, which allow you to revive at those upon death instead. This, coupled with the ability to set light beacons on the map to mark areas of interest you’ll want to visit later, makes this one of the easiest Souls games to navigate, despite the sometimes confusing world.Map fragments can be found which will fill in details on the overworld map, giving you a better idea of where structures are located. You are able to purchase a crafting kit early on which allows you to collect resources from the world to craft a variety of items, most important of which are arrows. Vendors often sell new cookbook recipes which allow you to create additional items upon purchasing.Getting Started:Elden Ring provides the most robust character creation system to date, with the ability to alter skin color, voice, age, and nearly every aspect of your character’s face, hair, and body. Coupled with 10 base templates, including warrior, aristocrat, truth-seeker, northerner, draconian, nightfolk, numen, seafarer, and reedlander, along with nine starting classes including warrior, wretch, prisoner, samurai, prophet, vagabond, hero, bandit, astrologer, and confessor, each with their own unique abilities, stats, and starting weapons and armor. You’re also given your choice of a keepsake, including items which raise your starting HP, can be used to add another flask to your inventory, or even unlock secret areas.Multiplayer Basics:Elden Ring’s take on multiplayer is unique to the Souls series, but still functions essentially the same, although you must use a variety of items to fully participate including the Tarnished’s Furled Finger, Furcalling Finger Remedy, White and Blue Cipher Rings, Festering Bloody Finger, and the Duelist’s Furled Finger.You will not see summon signs without first using the Furlcalling Finger Remedy, which can be purchased or crafted. By using this item, you’ll see signs of both allies and adversaries. Gold signs are for allies who will join your match until you defeat a boss, while red signs indicate adversaries who will come into your game to duel.To help other players, you can use the Tarnished’s Furled Finger to place a gold sign which will allow players to call you into their game. When summoned, you are known as the Furled Finger and the summoner is known as the Host of Fingers. You can use the Duelist’s Furled Finger to leave a red summon sign and challenge other players to a duel.You can place signs nearly anywhere in the game, but most signs you will find near a site of grace or summoning pools, which serve as a collective area for players to easily find cooperators and duelists. Summoning pools must be activated by examining statues, usually nearby a site of grace. There is an item which can be used to send your summoning sign to multiple summoning pools in your general area, helping you find a variety of players to co-op with.The Festering Bloody Finger is used to invade another player’s world in hopes of defeating them. The White Cipher Ring, when in use, will call for a hunter from another world to aid you when yours is invaded, while the Blue Cipher Ring allows you to be called to the aid of another hunter.Despite having to use an item before seeing any signs and the new summoning pool aspect, multiplayer is almost exactly like previous Souls entries. For those who do not play online but would still like help occasionally, there are NPCs you can find who will then aid you during specific boss fights.
Richard’s Impressions:It’s no secret that I’m a huge Souls fan, so I’ve been waiting for Elden Ring for years and can safely say that it has lived up to my expectations. Sure, I have a few gripes with the open world aspect, but I also applaud FromSoftware for taking risks with the Souls formula and creating their most diverse gaming world yet. For those afraid that this entry may be easy, you can quit worrying – you’re still going to die, a lot. While yes, some bosses and enemies feel easier than past Souls games, there are still quite a few ridiculously hard areas you’ll traverse and bosses you’ll encounter, especially late game. In reality, the only reason parts of the game feel easier is just because there’s so many bosses and areas with such a wide variety of encounters that every playstyle will run into a mixture of difficulties depending on their build and skill set.Elden Ring awards runes for defeating enemies, rather than souls. Leveling up takes far longer in this entry than in previous Souls games, ensuring that despite having a ton of bosses and enemy packs to encounter, you won’t be able to overpower the enemies by becoming too strong too early. This means you’ll have to pick your stats wisely, as you’ll need to perfect your playstyle to make it through all the encounters you’ll face. If you begin to feel you’re becoming overpowered, don’t worry – you will inevitably hit a brick wall of difficulty as you progress, no matter how much you’ve leveled up in preparation.That brick wall of difficulty is one of my only gripes with Elden Ring. Don’t get me wrong, I come into these games expecting a challenge, but Elden Ring is the first time that I felt a few of the bosses, including one of the “main” bosses, actually felt unfair due to their ability to one-shot kill you despite your level and stats, and their sporadic moveset which made them nearly impossible to predict. While sure, I know there are a few people out there who will breeze through even the toughest fights, I feel most will become frustrated. Thankfully, co-op makes most of these fights easier as you can use a summoned player to help distract a boss, but this time around it almost feels as if the game was created with co-op in mind – which is sure to upset a few people who believe solo is the only way to play the series. That said, even with co-op that “main” boss I mentioned above was still frustratingly difficult and took out my summons with one hit as well before I felt like I essentially just got lucky and beat him.I don’t mind a Souls game being created around the idea of playing co-op, in fact, co-op is my favorite thing about the Souls series. But early on when there weren’t many players that had reached my level it made a few of the fights incredibly frustrating. Now that the community has flourished and can be found nearly everywhere in The Lands Between, this frustration has mostly been alleviated.The open world is a breath of fresh air for the series, and provides you with nearly unlimited freedom from your first minutes with the game. Sites of grace will feature a guiding light you can follow to your main objective, but the game world was created to be explored. In fact, not exploring will almost certainly result in you failing to defeat any of the game’s “main” bosses. The world is filled to the brim with locations to discover, ruins to scour, enemies to take down, optional bosses to fight, and caves to explore.That sheer freedom of exploration, while amazing, is actually a hindrance to the game at times, as there is almost too much to discover with next to no help in finding these optional locations. You can easily ride right past a door and miss a whole cave and boss, not to mention weapons or ashes of war. While I loved stumbling upon new locations, as more and more of the map opened up I became overwhelmed with keeping track of where I’ve been and where I still needed to explore. The developers do seem to recognize this, and thanks to the new beacon system, I was able to leave beacons on the map for any area that I needed to come back to once I felt leveled up enough to handle the boss or enemies there. That minor gripe aside, the core gameplay is nearly perfect and even when overwhelmed with options and areas to explore, I still had a blast.  As the internet scours every nook and cranny and makes detailed lists of bosses and items, this issue will disappear altogether, as you’ll no longer have to worry about whether or not you missed an item or area.While the focus of any Elden Ring coverage seems to be the open world, that’s just a small part of the overall experience, essentially functioning as an area to explore and level up before progressing the story, which normally involves exploring a variety of dark and dangerous manors, dungeons, and more which all would feel at home in any Dark Souls title, particularly Dark Souls 3. These locations are beautifully detailed, containing an impressive variety of gruesome and difficult foes, and normally house much more threatening bosses. The freedom of the open world contrasts nicely with the claustrophobic indoor areas to create the most varied Souls experience yet. Seriously, no matter how many hours I poured into this game I continued to be amazed by the sheer variety of locations, the creativity of the enemies, and the fact that at 60 hours in I was still finding new areas to explore.Along with the open world is a new focus on crafting, which has players collecting bushes and even bones from animals to create anything from arrows to explosive pots. The amount of items you can craft grows as you progress through the campaign, either by finding cookbook pages or purchasing new pages off of merchants. While I didn’t mess with the crafting often, aside from making sure I always had a full quiver of arrows, it is a nice addition that I’m sure many players will enjoy.Unlike the other editor who played on PC, I found next to no issues on the PS5. Load time is near instantaneous and the graphics are downright gorgeous. I found myself constantly snapping pictures of the locations, enemies, and bosses I encountered as the game constantly ups itself with creativity in both location and enemy design. I only encountered slowdown once, and it was random – I think it was actually related to my internet messing up rather than the game because it quickly resolved itself. This fast loading extends to summoning, with Elden Rings boasting the fastest summoning process in any Souls game. It’s incredible to enter an area, see a summoning sign, and have a player at your side in mere seconds – this definitely helps make Elden Ring a more accessible entry and new areas less stressful to explore.  This was originally a review in progress, as to me, the Souls games are a shared experience, and to be missing that aspect hurts the overall experience. During the original review timeframe there was next to zero co-op available, due to the limited number of players available. Now that the game has been out for a few days that has changed, and the community is in full swing, providing the online experience I expect from the series. The online experience has been wonderful, and I’ve thankfully encountered little issue with summoning or being summoned. The messages left by players are hilarious, informative, and still dangerous to follow blindly as many are hoping to lead you to an early death.I can easily say that this is my favorite Souls experience. Simultaneously unique and familiar, the beautiful landscape, incredible enemy and boss design, sheer variety of weapons and builds available, and the introduction of crafting and weapon skills all converge to create my favorite gameplay experience in years, and one I look forward to mastering throughout the next few months.David’s Impressions:To be completely honest, I’ve been getting very tired of the Souls formula. I skipped Sekiro and while I have dabbled in the Demon’s Souls remake, it largely feels like I have been there done that three or four times before. That being said, I was extremely excited for Elden Ring and it’s shaking up of tried and true gameplay styles. Having put over 20 hours into the game so far, and having only defeated 2 demigods, I can safely say that this was a change well worth the wait. It does have a few issues that have been creeping into FromSoftware’s design since at least Dark Souls 2, but the more open ended approach feels like a revelation.I started off with the Astrologian class as I like to have a mix of melee and magic. While the former feels about the same as ever, with slow, methodical animations, magic actually feels a lot better now. For starters, you have combos which use both your FP and Stamina to rapidly cast the same spell. Early on, this speed allows magic to feel overpowered, but quickly most foes gain a lot of resistance to magic so only the most dedicated of spellcasters can fully rely on it.While you are directed by the grace light towards Stormveil castle and the first Shardbearer, the game fully expects you to explore most if not all of the open world before even going in that direction. There is certainly a lot to see and do, but the lack of direction can occasionally grind progression to a halt. Exploration in and of itself is an absolute joy – you can ride past encounters you don’t feel prepared for and engage with those that you do in any way you see fit. There are bosses to slay, caves and dungeons to delve into, and even secret teleports to take you across the entire map. The aforementioned caves and dungeons are probably my favorite part because a lot of them offer a streamlined microcosm of the larger, story critical dungeons. After entering, you’ll always find a site of grace to allow you to teleport back or respawn when you die, and sometimes you’ll even see the boss door directly in front of you. The rest of the dungeon leads to a leaver to open said boss door, allowing you to retry the boss without going through the whole thing over and over. The level design here feels focused on convenience while still providing an interesting world to explore along with a mostly fair challenge.Surprisingly, the most frustrating part is actually finding places of interest. Caves in particular blend into the shadows of cliff faces so I found myself walking past quite a few of them, leading me to wander around searching for places to get new items and level my character up for the next challenge in the story. Wandering can be fun in and of itself, but sometimes you just want to progress and you can’t find a single level 2 smithing shard to upgrade your weapon to the next tier even though you have plenty of level 3 and beyond shards. Just a bit more direction would be appreciated, while still having exploration as the focus. There are a few spirits you can find who will slowly guide you to a dungeon, but those are few and far between.When I say the game is mostly fair, I’m talking about THOSE enemies who seem to be able to kill you effortlessly even if you do everything right. You know the ones I’m talking about: the knight whose powerful overhead strike magnetizes to you, the ghost that just spawns in after you pass by even though you made sure to check the corner, and of course that one boss who will occasionally just one hit kill you for no reason. Make no mistake, Elden Ring has more than its fair share of BS to go along with fights that actually feel fair and those that are way too easy. Granted, some of this may be due to the open world and being able to go wherever you want, but for quite a few leveling or even “getting good” doesn’t help, it’s pure luck.I also hate to say it given how gorgeous the game is, but playing Elden Ring on PC might not be the best experience. You do have a very nice suite of options to work with, fully rebindable controls, the ability to seamlessly swap between keyboard and mouse, mouse cursor support for menus, and even some very nice HDR, but the game has a tendency to stutter or hang pretty frequently. I suspect this has something to do with shader caching because it mostly happens when entering a new area or fighting a new boss. The game also keeps running during these stutters because of its always online nature, so this can lead to some deaths you literally cannot avoid. I did eventually learn to deal with them, but it remains a frustration throughout the game and will hopefully be fixed in future patches along with the crashes they can cause.  There’s also a strange issue where two lines of dialogue skip when you press A, and this even occurs when selecting a dialogue option.After the initial two areas, the game feels intended for co-op play. That’s not to say you can’t play solo, but the odds feel more stacked against a lone adventurer than normal. Most normal enemies can take a lot of damage and deal even more, so unless you’re very patient either to grind or avoid attacks for a very long time, you’ll want to summon a few friends. Unfortunately, I still haven’t been able to do this several days after launch. You can summon spirits to help you in select locations, but a certain boss I’m stuck on doesn’t allow you to do so. I don’t know why I can’t summon people, the game just tells me it failed.Elden Ring is the culmination of all the Souls entries up to this point, creating a near perfect gameplay experience filled to the brim with incredible boss fights, gorgeous graphics, and an insanely large world to explore. A variety of new ideas, including crafting and the addition of the spirit horse Torrent, help bring a new level of immersion to the proceedings while simultaneously helping Elden Ring feel like a unique entry in the Souls genre. With gameplay tailored for players who want to experience the world solo as well as those who wish to play nearly the entire game in co-op, Elden Ring is a masterclass in design. Minor gripes about a couple of boss fights and the sheer density of the world to explore leaving many areas potentially undiscovered aside, Elden Ring is a nearly flawless experience which old and new fans of the Souls series will enjoy.

Besting a boss after hours of memorising their attack patterns is all part of the fun.Elden Ring is by far the most accessible game the developer has made, but that doesn’t mean it’s easy. Rather than lowering the difficulty ceiling, it has instead raised the floor.By throwing open the doors of its vast world, Elden Ring maintains the genre’s reputation for challenge without being marred by artificial barriers to entry.With an updated combat system that combines Sekiro with the classic Souls formula, Elden Ring is one of the best games FromSoftware has ever made and is a strong, early contender for 2022’s game of the year... but it’s not for the faint of heart.We played 20 hours of the game on PS5 ahead of its release, in which we were able to explore the open areas of the Lands Between as well as numerous dungeons, Stormveil Castle and the Lake of Liurnia. We died a lot.Read more: We started with the “Confessor” background – a high-levelled “sword and sorcery” build – to make good use of the game’s melee combat and spells.Rating: 9.5/10Players will choose their starting character at the beginning of the game, and take the title of “Tarnished”, a moniker given to outcasts who are looked down upon. The aim of the Tarnished is to seek the power of the Elden Ring by collecting fragments from powerful demi-gods, to become the Elden Lord.The Lands Between are vast and perilousLike the Hunters of Bloodborne, the player character is tasked with roaming the open world of the Lands Between to vanquish challenging foes along the way. An early cutscene goes into detail about the game’s lore and the demi-gods whose desire for power caused the Elden Ring to shatter and the ensuing war that, after time, allowed the Tarnished to return and claim its power. Along the way, the Tarnished will be contacted by a “finger maiden” named Melina and form an accord, which allows the player to trade in runes (Elden Ring’s equivalent of souls) for added strength, as well as summon a horse named Torrent.The story of Elden Ring’s world is more frontloaded than previous FromSoftware games and it’s easy to imagine that George RR Martin’s influence on the story played some part in this. The usual melancholy that lingers in the world is still there, but that sense of adventure feels more focused, rather than buried within vague item descriptions where details can be easily missed.The Lands Between is a realm that has seen its fair share of war and turmoil and is now inhabited by a number of hostile creatures and areas of interest to explore. Immediately, that sense of scale can be overwhelming. There’s plenty to see and do in the early areas of the game but sites of grace (rest and fast travel points) leave an ethereal trail to guide players along a desired path. Of course, these can be ignored completely.Make sure you’re prepared before facing the game’s biggest foesAlmost immediately, the open world of Elden Ring is a step away from Miyazaki’s previous settings. A far cry from the labyrinthian level design that loops and bends in on itself in previous FromSoftware games, the vast open fields are less reminiscent of a dark fantasy horror but rather games like Breath of the Wild, where the simple act of exploration is enough to inspire awe. Leaving the tutorial area of Elden Ring to roam around its fields gave the same feeling of undertaking a grand adventure, as Breath of the Wild did, but shortly after, that sense of foreboding malice that permeates all of FromSoftware’s games takes hold.That open world has not prevented Elden Ring from maintaining its scope, however. Within it are numerous caves, catacombs and castles that provide an experience that will prove more familiar to Souls veterans.What that delinearity has helped to achieve is fundamental to Elden Ring’s broader appeal. If, when pushed in a certain direction, a player faces resistance from a powerful enemy, a large encampment or roaming mobs, the previous solution was to power through until it could be overcome. Now, they are spread in every direction and if the challenge becomes too much to bear, you’re left with the option to disengage and approach something else, for the time being.Sites of grace are a rare solace in ‘Elden Ring'In the same vein, the abundance of sites of grace and their proximity to those chokepoints make returning to those areas less of a chore. The arbitrary slog of working your way towards a particular boss is no longer a drag, as players have the option to jump straight back in after a failed attempt. Some FromSoftware fans may not like the sound of this initially. After all, trial and error are essential to the learning curve. But with the added option to explore the surrounding area in greater detail, the need to return to the fray through the path of most resistance has vanished. If anything, it has helped to justify each boss’s strenuous difficulty, as the challenge lies solely in the bout. The creatures of the Lands Between take all shapes and sizes. Human patrols fitted in medieval armour can be spotted by campfires from great distances, just as hollow-chested trolls lug great wagons across rolling hills. Even lumbering pots, animated with long appendages, slowly amble before being agitated by those wishing to break them. The creativity of FromSoftware’s monster design knows no bounds and, considering influences span European folklore and Japanese horror, you never really know what to expect around each corner.Summon spirits to fight alongside youOne of the mechanics that has carried over from Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is stances, now known as “poise”. Defending, blocking and countering attacks is important in maintaining health, and if an enemy is able to break your poise then it leaves you vulnerable to critical attacks. Poise can be maintained by timing blocks correctly, parrying with a shield or performing a heavy counter attack directly after an opponent strikes, all of which can leave you vulnerable to damage. It’s a welcome addition to the formula that rewards good reaction time and speed alongside the defensive style of play commonly associated with Dark Souls. Another carry-over from Sekiro is jumping and stealth. Jumping attacks are much more powerful than normal strikes, but also leave players completely vulnerable, and stealth is always a good option to pick off stragglers before facing a large group head-on. Weapon arts also make a return from Dark Souls 3, which allows players to further customise their weapons at the cost of magic.Torrent the horse can clear large distancesWith Torrent the horse, mounted combat also becomes a feasible option. Mounted enemies, and even bosses, are commonly spread throughout the Lands Between and the added mobility is put to good use. Torrent’s double jump can also be used to navigate between chasms and over cliffs, and the animal is capable of travelling quickly, which can be useful in extremely hostile areas.The most notable additions to combat are “spirit ashes”, or NPCs that are summonable whenever a monument is nearby – these are usually found at points of interest as well as in boss areas. While fairly expendable, especially in the face of the game’s tougher bosses, they can be used to draw attention away from the player. They take a number of different forms, including a pack of wolves, sorcerers or even a giant jellyfish. They offer a fair trade if online matchmaking is not working in your favour (they can’t be used if you summon other players to your game).Multiplayer options will allow players to either summon players to their world to help them defeat bosses or assist them in theirs, much like in previous games. The usual messages providing words of encouragement, a caution of the danger ahead or the location of hidden items also make a welcome return, as does the ability to summon challengers or repel invaders, should you so choose.If you consider yourself a longtime fan of FromSoftware games, then you’ve likely already made your decision about playing Elden Ring. If you are worried that the open world, fast travel systems and optional dungeons will render the game too easy, then fear not. Elden Ring offers plenty of challenges for players, while its improved combat mechanics and traversal provide ample opportunity for newcomers to get acquainted with the genre.

Elden Ring,Dan Silver,Telegraph,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/features/elden-ring-review-punishing-open-world-take-dark-souls-formula/,"
			Hidetaka Miyazaki's new opus is one of the best-reviewed games of all time. This is why...
		Roll. Backstep. Run backwards... Wait for the two storey-tall golden axe crashing down into the causeway, dislodging a lethal fan of flagstones and masonry. Once. Twice...Charge back in. Leap into a mid-air attack. Feel the blow land. Notice the boss's health bar has shrunk – not nearly enough but, still... Is there a chance to land another blow? A heartbeat's worth of indecision. Perhaps if I just… Swoosh. Slash. Flames. A mournful, terminal groan. ""You Died"". Again…Describing, as many have, Elden Ring as a more accessible take on the notoriously exacting Dark Souls formula is at once both entirely correct and also palpable nonsense. Certainly in the delirious moments you’ll spend galavanting around the wonderful wilds of the Lands Between atop your ghostly goat-cum-horse steed, Torrent, galloping away from enormous monsters who can skewer you like a shish kebab with a single thrust of their blades, you might start to feel a hint of the warmth provided by the snuggly safety blankets of more conventional games. Dare to progress down the main story path, however, and it’s a much different, colder story. I like to think of myself as an intermediate level Souls combatant. I actually completed Bloodborne, game director Hidetaka Miyazaki's wonderful 2015 gothic horror PS4 exclusive (hey, I don’t want to brag, but…). And yet still it took me two nights and around two-dozen attempts to defeat Godric the Grafted, the giant golden axe-swinging, dragon’s breath-wielding Rune Lord we came in with. I’ve yet to meet any of his presumably more powerful peers but, despite the teeth-gnashing, fist-gnawing, ‘I’m giving up gaming forever’ frustration engendered by this encounter, I genuinely cannot wait to.It’s nigh-on impossible to discuss the so-called ‘Soulsborne’ genre as it’s become known – as promulgated by the triumvirate of Dark Souls titles, Bloodborne, the samurai sojourn Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and the original Demon Souls, recently remastered for PS5, which comprise Miyazaki’s near faultless back catalogue – without getting sucked into the ongoing discourse around game difficulty.One should try, though, as it’s almost entirely reductive – not least because difficulty is an entirely subjective concept. Miyazaka’s games are challenging, for sure, punishing even, but they’re also impeccably fair, strictly adhering to a complex set of rules. Once you, the player, has learned those rules, you can start to subvert them. And that’s where the fun starts.Elden Ring exponentially expands on that premise by introducing an open world setting to the formula for the first time. The intricately laid out castles, cathedrals, and cities of the Souls games still punctuate the major narrative beats, but they’re exclamation points scattered across vast pages of ridiculously picturesque fantasy-scapes. The closest comparison point is Nintendo’s exemplary Breath of the Wild setting (albeit with Hieronymus Bosch in charge of creature design); everything feels possible, and very little feels scripted.Here, exploration is everything. Elden Ring is an RPG but one which elevates role playing to the point of vérité. You are as much the stranger in a strange land as your avatar; basic controls and some mechanics are explained in what passes for the game's tutorial, but that’s about it. There’s no quest log, no icon-studded mini-map, no on-screen overlays or bread crumb trail telling you what to do next, or even where to go. Everything else must be learned, either decoded from oblique item descriptions in-game or gleaned from invaluable internet communities. Death is not so much a setback to be avoided as a necessary staging post on the path to enlightenment. It may sound daunting in theory but in practice it’s exhilarating. Every inch of progress in Elden Ring feels earned, and is thus infinitely more rewarding for it.The contrast with the well-worn formula employed by more traditional AAA action RPGs like Horizon Forbidden West, for example, could not be starker. And while it’s not always instructive – or fair – to compare games with such different approaches to the medium, the proximity of this pair's release dates coupled with their broad structural similarities, make it inevitable. In doing so, I’m minded of a recent observation by the venerable videogame journalist, Chris Schilling, who likened Sony’s increasingly homogenous brand of blockbusters to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (neither criticism nor insult, I might hasten to add). Viewed through that lens, Horizon Forbidden West is Chloe Zhao’s flashy but ultimately unfulfilling MCU effort, Eternals, while Elden Ring more resembles her intimate and captivating Oscar-winner, Nomadland. And, it should really go without saying, that’s absolutely fine. There’s room enough in the gaming world for both; neither approach is intrinsically more valid; and chances are many more people will enjoy the former than the latter (although Elden Ring’s extraordinary first week sales figures, confirming it as the biggest videogame launch since the last Call of Duty instalment, suggest the critical hype has cut through and then some – even if it remains to be seen how many of those new players last the course). However, only one of these games can genuinely hold a claim to being among the very best produced not just this year but, in fact, of any year. And – spoiler alert – it’s the one in which you will die over and over and over but still come back for more. Again…Elden Ring is out now on PS4 and PS5 (version reviewed), Xbox One, Series S and X, and PC"
Elden Ring,Simon Parkin,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/feb/23/elden-ring-review-an-unrivalled-masterpiece-of-design-and-inventiveness,"PC, PlayStation 4/5, Xbox One/Series S/Series X; FromSoftware/Namco BandaiThis is a massive world, astonishingly rendered and seemingly limitless in its creative diversityUnder a butter-yellow sky, high up on the Altus Plain, driving my horse at full gallop, I spied a group of peasant women dancing. They hopped between feet, as if on scorching ground, twirling in unison beneath the sails of a neglected windmill. It is a mesmerising scene – one of hundreds you will happen upon while exploring the relentlessly beautiful, relentlessly hostile expanse of Elden Ring’s fantasy world, the Lands Between – but its rustic appeal is not to be trusted. I learned that lesson several hours earlier, when I caught the strains of a melancholic song carried by the wind. I rode toward the sound, hoping to meet someone who might offer support in my journey. The singer, however, was no friendly merchant or cooperative knight, but a grotesque siren, with beating leather wings and foot-long claws. The song was a ploy, and I was the prey.The dangers posed by director Hidetaka Miyazaki’s games have been notorious since 2009’s Demon’s Souls: these are challenging works, filled with eldritch monsters, where even apparent allies are not to be fully trusted. Every danger must, eventually, be confronted. But Elden Ring differs from its predecessors in its expanse: every hillcrest represents a fresh opportunity. If one path seems too foreboding, one dragon too fearsome, one group of cackling dancers too disconcerting, you can simply ride off in another direction. The rhythms of struggle, setback, perseverance and, finally, triumph familiar to any player of Miyazaki’s work are present here, and exquisitely refined. But the frustrations have been eased; there is always another alluring path wending into the horizon, another cave entrance hidden in the bushes, another mineshaft down to a subterranean cathedral city.This is an ancient world. Old battles have left scars on the earth: toppled statues, rotting fortifications, charred ground where the grass is yet to regrow. Game of Thrones’s creator George RR Martin provided Elden Ring’s history, a narrative foundation on which Miyazaki and his team have carefully built. But don’t expect House Lannister-style intrigue; this is not a story game in any traditional sense. There are no tedious cinematics to endure. Any character you meet who wants to talk, rather than fight, will offer only fragments of clues about the world and your purpose within it. What is clear, however, is that Elden Ring wants you dead or banished, and you must scavenge whatever resources and alliances you can to resist extinction.Newcomers have much to learn, but Elden Ring is a more welcoming game than its predecessors. While there are hundreds of different weapons to find and forge, even your chosen character’s starting arsenal, once improved by the relevant blacksmith, will remain workable for dozens of hours. Provided you’ve wooed them correctly, friendly characters or other players can be summoned to provide support during the most challenging battles with the game’s hellish monstrosities, and it’s now possible to conjure a variety of spectral warriors to provide additional backup. As in Miyazaki’s previous games, you are never entirely alone in Elden Ring. The ghostly outlines of other players occasionally flicker on-screen as you roam its world. Later, hostile players may enter to hunt you – and others can be summoned to your defence.Combat in Elden Ring is unmatched by any other game, with a sense of heft and precision that rewards patience and learning, whether battling with weapons or spells. You can fight on the ground or, if you prefer, on horseback, galloping around a foe before retreating to a safe distance. Your steed, Torrent, is a revelatory introduction, clambering sheer rockfaces like a mountain goat, enabling thrilling getaways with his pace and nimbleness. It is possible to gallop across a misted lake, wake and draw a dragon from the mouth of the cave it guards, then dip inside, loot the treasure from horseback, and make your escape.Miyazaki and his team prize secrets, and opening up the world has multiplied the possibility for riddles, conundrums and treasure hunts. There is a deep sense of wonder and excitement whenever you happen upon a cave mouth on some out-of-the-way shoreline that leads to a warren of trinkets – and the ghostly graffiti that other players can leave to point others toward these points of interest has never been more useful. Miyazaki’s worlds have always felt like elegant contraptions, with secret passages and delicious shortcuts that provide “ah-ha” moments as the architectural logic is revealed. That sense of watchmaker’s vision is only heightened by Elden Ring’s expanded scale, and minute details (the skeletons who, once reformed from a pile of bones, tap their heads down into place) ensure Elden Ring delights from every angle.It is not an accomplishment in itself for a game to be large, or long. An algorithm could theoretically toss off a virtual universe, and another could fill it with busywork. It is inane to equate scale with value and enrichment. Elden Ring’s hills, valleys, mountaintop settlements and underground palaces offer something far rarer: true texture, variety, and long-term intrigue. This is a massive world, astonishingly rendered (the sun and moon wheel in the sky, casting each scene anew) and seemingly limitless in its creative diversity. It is an unrivalled feat of design and inventiveness. For Miyazaki, Elden Ring represents the actualisation of a vision he and his team have refined for more than a decade. Technology has finally provided the power to meet their expansive imaginations.Video games can be all kinds of different things, representing all manner of artistic ambitions. Most, however, share a common goal: to conjure a compelling fictional reality, filled with beckoning mysteries, enchanting secrets, and enriching opportunities to compete and collaborate. They aim to provide a liminal space in which a determined player can fix that which is broken, order that which is chaotic. By this definition, at least, Elden Ring is the finest video game yet made. Its final gift is the assurance that, whatever monsters lurk in a broken world, with perseverance and cooperation, they too can be overcome – all without losing the mystery and wonder that makes our existence beguiling, infuriating, and fascinating.Elden Ring is released on 25 February; £49.99."

Here’s how it works.It feels like an eternity since fans were treated to Elden Ring's reveal trailer back at E3 2019. This brief video provided a glimpse into its mysterious world, and it set the internet ablaze with excitement over this bold new collaboration between Game of Thrones creator George R.R. Martin and legendary game director Hidetaka Miyazaki. Considering FromSoftware is known for impressive consistency with its titles, which include 2019 Game of the Year Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, expectations from players like myself were justifiably astronomical.What none of us knew was that the following year would bring a devastating pandemic that would not only dramatically impact our lives but would also disrupt the video games industry. As development teams frantically adjusted to remote work, it became more apparent with each passing month that titles like Elden Ring would be launching much later than initially planned.Thankfully, our era of suspense is now at an end. I've spent close to 70 hours throwing myself into the grandeur of Elden Ring, and the more I play, the more I find myself in awe of the sheer scope of FromSoftware's latest offering. There's no shortage of content for players looking to get engrossed in a land of beauty, horror, mystery, and adventure. This gargantuan RPG not only met my most outlandish expectations, but repeatedly exceeded them. Miyazaki and company have delivered a fantasy epic that viciously scrapes and claws its way into the pantheon of unforgettably important video games like Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Elden Ring is FromSoftware's most remarkable work so far and stands confidently as one of the greatest RPGs of all time.Bottom line: Elden Ring is a masterclass in open-world game design. FromSoftware has poetically fashioned a gorgeously haunting universe that begs to be explored. It's a quintessential action RPG and an obvious contender for game of the year.Disclaimer: This review was made possible by a review code provided by Bandai Namco. The company did not see the contents of the review before publishing.Players in Elden Ring take the role of a chosen Tarnished. These outcast individuals and their ancestors lost their grace and were banished from The Lands Between. Following the Shattering of the Elden Ring, the Greater Will has summoned our chosen Tarnished out of desperation to help reestablish the Golden Order. Your main objective is to hunt down the demi-god children of Queen Marika the Eternal to gather the Great Runes in hopes of garnering the power required to become the next Elden Lord. As you might imagine, these demi-gods won't give up their newfound power willingly. This conflict is the catalyst for your time in The Lands Between.Players familiar with FromSoftware's previous Souls-likes will immediately feel a sense of comfort upon opening Elden Ring. The control scheme, the flow of combat, and character progression are quite similar to Dark Souls 3 in many ways, but it's also immediately apparent that this isn't a Dark Souls game.After emerging from a brief tutorial cave, you're bathed in the stunning view of Elden Ring's starting area Limgrave and given your first taste of the true scale of this new adventure. As a Dark Souls veteran, it was clear I wasn't in Lordran anymore.The next 60+ hours of playtime with Elden Ring were a constant feast for the senses. The transition to open-world game design enriched the dynamics of moment-to-moment gameplay and supplied a steady stream of captivating environments and memorable set pieces. Inhabiting these unparalleled locations are a host of fascinating and often disgusting enemies and larger-than-life boss encounters. While long-time fans of FromSoftware will recognize some familiar faces, there are plenty of creatures and characters in Elden Ring you definitely won't see anywhere else.Elden Ring also turbo-charges the player freedom and customization of titles like Dark Souls and Bloodborne. With 10 starting classes, each with specific starting items and abilities, you're given the flexibility to play almost any way you see fit. The tuning applied to weapons, magic, and even consumable items allows you to immerse yourself in the class fantasy of your choosing. Much like the tabletop RPGs that inspired so many iconic video games, every stat point, piece of gear, and gadget you bring acquire matters. And depending on your playstyle will likely be the difference between life and death.Despite my anticipation for Elden Ring, I was admittedly worried that FromSoftware's transition to a traditional open-world style RPG would negatively impact the attention to detail many fans have grown to love. One of the reasons I hold Dark Souls 3 to such a high regard is because of how meticulously crafted every location feels. From the iconic towers of Anor Lando to the wooded swamp of the Road of Sacrifices, Dark Souls 3 never backs down when it comes to unforgettable scenery. Even benign background objects like bookshelves or weapon racks have their specific purpose in that world. Some of these concerns were slightly amplified after the slight taste of the Network Test due to what I assumed was a lack of biome diversity. Thankfully, I can confirm this wasn't a problem in Elden Ring.The stunningly dense locations encourage exploration in a way that other open-world RPGs can only dream of.What consistently surprised me about Elden Ring is how it managed to take all the core elements I love about Dark Souls 3 and expand upon their scale in meaningful ways. Nothing is lost with the dramatically increased map size. In fact, the stunningly dense locations encourage exploration in a way that other open-world RPGs can only dream of. Every structure or strange creature in the distance becomes a new mission. Subtle yet deliberate environmental details entice the player, and I almost always felt rewarded for venturing off the beaten path.FromSoftware understands its audience's proclivities for uncovering hidden secrets. Seasoned players know that not everything is quite what it seems in a FromSoftware RPG, from invisible walls to entire regions locked behind specific gameplay mechanics. Elden Ring beckons you around each and every corner, and by providing a steady stream of weapons, upgrade materials, and even secret alternate paths, I never felt as though I was wasting my time by chasing after a curious hunch. This sense of accomplishment encouraged me to allow myself to get distracted in the best possible ways. So many of my favorite pieces of equipment were discovered entirely by accident.With the broader scope of The Lands Between comes new methods of traversal. First is the ability to jump at will. This might sound like a relatively trivial feature for players unfamiliar with Dark Souls, but there's no denying how much more satisfying platforming becomes because of it. Your Spectral Steed, a mystical horse you can summon at will, is another noteworthy addition to the open-world formula that provides a consistent way to quickly traverse the map without an over-reliance on fast travel locations. Much like Breath of the Wild or Skyrim, these gameplay tools are crucial when maneuvering across Elden Ring's sprawling landscapes.Over the last few decades, FromSoftware has crafted some of the most beloved locations in video game history. In particular, Miyazaki and the Souls team have a methodical approach to environmental design and storytelling. Whether it be cult-like structure in the distance or a pile of seared, decaying bodies, everything serves its purpose. While it's probably hard for some fans to imagine scenery more enigmatic than Dark Souls staples like Firelink Shrine or Kiln of the First Flame, Elden Ring manages to regularly bestow just that.The immaculate implementation of color and lighting throughout Elden Ring is nothing short of praiseworthy.Elden Ring has the best color balance I've ever seen in a video game. The environments scattered throughout The Lands Between all serve as testaments to this team's attention to the importance of color. Areas like Limgrave delicately display hues of green and amber, while other locations like Liurnia Lake feature deep blue skies with speckles of good trickling on the horizon. Elden Ring isn't afraid to show this scenery, either. There are plenty of opportunities to enjoy the gorgeous views and jaw-dropping vistas for each of the varied biomes in the game.The visual excellence of Elden Ring also extends to its interior locations. Dark caves and catacombs serve as playgrounds for the excellent lighting and particle effects. It's exhilarating watching blue glimmers from magic attacks or the distinct orange glow of a torch dance off tunnel walls. This emphasis on lighting is amplified by an impressive dynamic day/night cycle, which fundamentally changes the atmosphere of the game's dozens of locations. The immaculate implementation of color and lighting throughout Elden Ring is nothing short of praiseworthy. I confidently took 100 screenshots during my time with the game just based on presentation alone.The number of enemies and bosses in Elden Ring is outrageous. Every few hours, you're introduced to fresh breeds of curious creatures or malicious monstrosities. As someone who's played every other FromSoftware RPG, I recognized my fair share of returning favorites, like gigantic crabs and ravenous hounds missing heaps of fur. However, I was genuinely taken aback by how many new enemy types were introduced, especially because so many of them are things I've never seen in a video game before.It's not every day you see a spider-like hand monster crawling towards you at lightning speeds in a tight sewer corridor.I won't divulge any specifics to avoid venturing into spoiler territory. The most important thing to know about Elden Ring and its creature design is that FromSoftware wasn't afraid to get weird. From body-horror beasts that I couldn't even conjure in my darkest nightmares to whimsical and almost even cute citizens of fantastical cities, the inhabitants of The Lands Between are wildly diverse and endlessly fascinating. It's not every day you see a spider-like hand monster crawling towards you at lightning speeds in a tight sewer corridor, and if I'm being honest, it's not something I ever want to see again.And no FromSoftware RPG is complete without over-the-top boss battles in grandiose locations set to fierce orchestral music. Thankfully, this is another area Elden Ring delivers in spades. The animation details during boss encounters throughout the game are remarkable. Terrifying foes like Margit the Fell Omen carefully bait players into attacking or dodging, only to follow up with devastating counterattacks. Witnessing these epic foes deliberately false-swipe or backstep before lunging forward forces you to remain engaged in ways we haven't even seen in other FromSoftware titles. If you're hoping for some sweaty, heart-pounding battles in Elden Ring, you will not be disappointed.One of Dark Souls' greatest strengths is how it empowers players through gameplay and equipment. You've always been given the freedom to choose what weapons you wield and which powers to summon, and this inherently determines how you'll engage in combat. Whether you're a thick tank carrying the heaviest club you can find or a sorcerer casting devastating magic from a distance, the ability for players to embrace precisely how they want to play has consistently been celebrated, and Elden Ring takes those principles to an entirely new level.With more magic, weapons, equipment, and tools than ever before, FromSoftware's open-world RPG provides a variable sandbox of destruction. I chose The Prophet class in my primary playthrough, which serves as a fascinating blend of the Cleric and Pyromancer from Dark Souls. With nature-drive incantations, I was able to hurl enormous balls of fire and even rend the earth with mystical claws. I also unlocked the ability to imbue my weapons with holy magic to help quickly defeat the undead. These unique powers fed into the power fantasy of my specific playthrough.If you want to pretend you're Simon Belmont and attack with a massive whip while throwing firebombs, the power is yours.If casting magic isn't your thing, don't worry; almost any weapon is viable in Elden Ring. If you want to pretend you're Simon Belmont and attack with a massive whip while throwing firebombs, the power is yours. If you want to put on some spiked knuckles and punch enemies into dust, that's entirely doable as well. Even with nearly 70 hours of playtime and likely many more to go before I officially complete my first run, I'm already planning my next starting class and my first level of New Game+. Just thinking about all the possibilities within Elden Ring is staggering.This immense customization and character flexibility are amplified by some of the best action-oriented combat in the genre. Players allocate an assortment of left and right-handed weapons, up to three per arm, that can be seamlessly interchanged by pressing the d-pad in the direction associated with that armament. Different weapon types will prove to be more effective against specific enemies. Blunt instruments like maces are exceptional at taking down armored foes, and fire wreaks havoc on any enemy with flesh or fur. An elegant ballet perfected in Elden Ring is understanding your opponents and the proper gear for an encounter.While much of my time with this ambitious RPG has legitimately been some of the best in my experience playing video games, there are a few key points to discuss regarding disappointing design elements and causes of likely frustration, especially for players who've never attempted a FromSoftware RPG before in Elden Ring.Even as a Souls-veteran, some of these fights took me over 20 tries to complete.First up, many of the hidden dungeons located throughout The Lands Between are formulaic. There are essentially three main biomes for these optional dungeons: caves, catacombs, and mines. Almost all of them adhere to one of these three themes, and often they repeat corridors or even boss encounters. As these are entirely supplemental to the more ornate and elaborate dungeons where many of the game's main story beats occur, I didn't have a significant issue with the repetition. Unfortunately, they felt markedly less exciting compared to the extraordinary mainline locations.And this wouldn't be a FromSoftware RPG review if we didn't talk about difficulty. Quality-of-life changes like increased checkpoint frequency and the ability to summon spirit companions to assist with more brutal encounters dramatically softens the overall challenge. However, there are still several critical boss encounters that will absolutely kick your ass. Even as a Souls veteran, some of these fights took me over 20 tries to complete. Although I thoroughly enjoyed many of these grueling bosses, I totally understand that not everyone has the patience for that level of stress. So, as you prepare for your upcoming Elden Ring adventure, just remember the timeless adage: Prepare to die.Like the RPGs that came before it, Elden Ring will likely be a divisive video game. On the one hand, there's no denying how incredibly designed this open-world epic is. Elden Ring takes the best elements of Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and gorgeously presents them to an entirely new audience. On the other hand, the difficulty during several boss battles will undoubtedly be too intense for casual RPG enthusiasts to overcome.For players willing to embrace the challenge and defeat seemingly insurmountable foes, Elden Ring is, without question, one of the greatest RPGs ever made. From rich exploration to constantly engaging combat, you're always rewarded for your efforts. The Lands Between instantly became one of my favorite video game worlds.If you want an RPG that promotes experimentation, provides dozens and dozens of unforgettable enemies and bosses, and celebrates the legacy of one of the most talented teams in game development, Elden Ring is a must-play.Bottom line: Elden Ring is a critically important RPG and one fans of the genre shouldn't miss. A truly special release that managed to exceed all expectations.Miles Dompier is a Freelance Video Producer for Windows Central, focusing on video content for Windows Central Gaming.

Elden Ring,David Carcasole,PlayStation Universe,https://www.psu.com/reviews/elden-ring-review-ps5/," David Carcasole / March 2, 2022Elden Ring Review (PS5) – Last week, when the embargo for Elden Ring hit I released a review in progress, which you should go read if you’ve not done.This week, I’m ready to present the full review of Elden Ring, and give it a final score. Last week I spoke about what it’s like to explore Elden Ring and why calling the fantasy epic a “big Dark Souls” is correct, but it achieves this in more ways than just scale, and combat.I’ll touch a little more on these again, but I’m going to talk more about bosses, technical issues I’ve faced, and the difficulty in Elden Ring.But mainly, I’m going to try and explain why I believe this to be a 10/10 game, despite its flaws.For all the detail, for all the lore, and for all the creatures to be found in previous FromSoftware titles, the settings of each of them, in one way or another feel dead.Even Sekiro, being placed in a semi-real world setting despite its mystical aspects struggles to feel like more than a well designed video game.None of them have felt alive, and I used to think that was part of the theme. Most of the world you encounter in Souls games are filled with undead enemies, dead things everywhere, and death at all corners.Overcoming all that, restoring your humanity, and succeeding on your journey each time I thought part of the whole schtick. Which makes The Lands Between all the more shocking and beautiful because it doesn’t feel dead at all.It truly feels alive, and that’s just the underbelly of what makes this a cut above other open-world games. The design of the world, the day and night cycle, the constant changing of weather, and the animals you’ll find frolicking.All that contributes to making the world feel alive, but what really clinches it for me is the enemy variety across the entire game. Yes, you’ll see variants of certain enemies, but each area includes entirely different creatures your worst nightmares couldn’t have dreamt up.Along with the entire lack of handholding as to where to go on the map, The Lands Between comes together as one of the most exciting open-worlds settings to explore to date. In fact, I’d go so far as to call it the best open world we’ve seen yet.There’s a notion that’s mainly peddled from within the Souls community, that FromSoftware’s games are all exceedingly, infuriatingly difficult. So, being able to conquer them must mean you have superior gaming skills.That’s not at all true. FromSoftware has made a reputation on creating difficult games, yes, but these games are by no means impossible. Yes, they can piss you off, but they really aren’t as difficult as the community makes them out to be.The reason being is that there’s almost always a trick or weakness to exploit with each enemy and boss, and each Souls game allows you to create and build a character to your liking and playstyle.Elden Ring is the perfect realization of abandoning the limits that partially gatekept Souls games from many players.Yes, you can create your character how you like in Elden Ring and Dark Souls before it, but the more linear nature of Dark Souls creates more unavoidable roadblocks, that you’re left banging your head against sometimes long enough that you give up.It’s happened to me in previous FromSoftware games, and though I’ve come back to these challenges eventually I had to just put the game down for a while, due to my frustration.You are always encourage to do the exact opposite in Elden Ring. Having difficulty with something right now? Go anywhere else, and see what’s over there. Maybe it won’t be as tough, maybe it will. If it is, go somewhere else again.Nothing is rushing you. You don’t have a quest log constantly reminding you of your next big task. It’s all at your pace, your journey, your discovery.In this way, you’re constantly acquiring important and useful items, spells, weapons, armour, and even runes just lying on the ground. It all works to make the consequence of death feel more insignificant than it’s felt before.Losing a lot of runes will still hurt, but it’s made easier knowing that the world is designed for you to be in a constant state of progression.This is why Elden Ring is the most approachable FromSoftware game yet. You don’t need to bang your head against anything for more than five minutes if you don’t want to.Everyone can jump in and discover a path that works for them, a playstyle, and if you can surpass even just Margit, The Fell Omen then the rest of the game is within your grasp.I know there will still be people who this game just isn’t for. There is a difference in difficulty from later bosses to early game bosses, but late game areas also provide some of the best farming to be found for runes in Elden Ring.Elden Ring is still a very challenging game, one that will likely take you a long time to complete. But there has never been a more approachable FromSoftware title than this, and it’s the most balanced the difficulty has felt for a long time.There are a lot – and I do mean a lot – of bosses in Elden Ring. Some small, some medium, some big, with a variety of those flavours being mandatory to complete the game.Veteran Souls players will recognize similarities with different bosses from previous games, whether it be in their design, their attack patterns and so on. However, that doesn’t mean the bosses of Elden Ring aren’t unique.The big issue the bosses in Elden Ring do have however, is repetition. This isn’t a big concern with the mainline bosses, but it is with all the mini bosses and optional bosses you’ll face.I didn’t like fighting the Magma Wyrm the first time, and I didn’t like it the next two times either. It also began to feel more boring as I found myself clearing caves and catacombs I’d missed or left for a time, and running over the boss like nothing.It’s a nice power trip, but that doesn’t last when the runes you’re awarded for your efforts fail to satisfy.This doesn’t mean these fights are bad the first time – sometimes all it takes for a good repeat boss is to have one or two different attacks to shake things up. But the spontaneity and heart-pounding clinches that make up the best fights in the game are lessened every I find myself fighting the same boss I’ve fought before, just in a different cave.There is a mandatory boss, which is almost a repeat of another, but the encounter is tweak enough so that it doesn’t feel similar at all. The rest of the mainline bosses are some of my favourite fights I’ve experienced in FromSoftware games.The quality of the bosses overall then sort of evens out, because the highs you’ll feel from the mandatory, big spectacle fights are some of the best in the developers history.Despite all the aspects of Elden Ring that are spectacular and innovating, the experience – especially on PC – is disappointingly held back by its performance.There hasn’t been a single session since I’ve received my code on PC where I’ve not dropped frames and stuttered to the point of a frozen picture, and then it catches up a second later.It’s annoying, especially for it to happen in fights, though I’ve been lucky enough to not die as a result, most of the time. The other annoying thing is that after a stutter, I’ll go minutes, even an hour without seeing any issues at all. And then the stutter rears its head.It almost feels like everything Elden Ring is crumbling under its own ambitions, though when it does work, the game achieves in everything it is trying to do so amazingly that I feel like I’m playing a new kind of open-world game.Stuttering isn’t the only issue on PC however, as I’ve also dealt with my game crashing, especially towards the end of a lengthy session. Since launch struck I have also been able to play Elden Ring on PS5 for a time, and can attest that it definitely runs a lot better on consoles right now.Nonetheless, having technical issues like this both before and now after launch is especially upsetting when considering that the best version of Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice lives on PC.Another FromSoftware launch with frustrating technical issues is the last thing Elden Ring needed, but still don’t think it really holds the game back.I might not have it as bad as some other players, but even with all these issues I still can’t even fathom playing any other game for another two weeks.There’s also the thought in my mind that, these issues will not persist forever. FromSoftware will patch them out. But as it stands, the version being sold right now is still in rough shape, and if you’re someone who struggles to tolerate the slightest performance issues, then you may just want to wait until they’re solved.It’s incredible to think about the high hopes that I, and many other players had for Elden Ring prior to release. Now having spent a substantial amount of time with the game, I still can’t believe it blew all my expectations out of the water, and then some.Elden Ring is the Souls formula that players already loved epitomized in a way that not only improves its every facet, but makes it the most approachable FromSoftware game yet.The technical issues I’ve faced have been trying, but even having my game crash twice in one session doesn’t make me want to stop playing.Because when it does work, it’s one of the best games I have ever played, period. Elden Ring is the Elden Lord of open-world games, and open-world design.Review code generously provided by the publisher.Elden Ring is out now on PS5, PS4, PC, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One.Elden Ring took the best parts of previous FromSoftware games and expanded them across a living open-world with endless discovery, excitement, and danger. It's not lost the edge of previous titles, but it is the most approachable FromSoftware game yet, and is an excellent point for players to jump in on if they've not tried previous titles. While its technical issues can be annoying, even they can't dampen the experience of playing Elden Ring. FromSoftware's latest is an artistic, innovative and cultural achievement like nothing before it.

Elden Ring,Liam Croft,Push Square,https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/elden-ring,"GuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpElden Ring2022 8.6Game RatingUser Ratings: 697Our Review: Scroll DownA song of life and deathVersion Reviewed: EuropeanElden Ring is a special, once in a generation type of game. You can feel it the moment you push open the set of double doors looking out onto the opening area of Limgrave and begin exploring the vast open world at your feet. It’s an astonishing feat, as Japanese developer FromSoftware adapts its wide but ultimately linear levels of the past to suit open-ended exploration and discovery. If it wasn’t for the few too many disappointments under the hood, Elden Ring would already have most Game of the Year awards under lock and key.FromSoftware can still be incredibly proud of its achievements here, though, as it successfully translates the Dark Souls formula to an open world setting. The Japanese developer hasn't let up on its commitment to difficulty in the slightest, and now you have the freedom to source that masochism from almost anywhere on the sprawling map of The Lands Between. A surprising amount of the world is open right from the off, allowing you to either take the main path or ride off into the sunset in any direction you see fit.And those opening, explorative hours are nothing short of gripping. Stumbling upon high-level areas, toppling optional boss fights, discovering secrets and hidden quests, spotting strange but captivating enemies and locations off in the distance: Elden Ring wholeheartedly fulfils that fantasy of an open world FromSoftware experience, triumphantly fusing difficulty, freedom, and intrigue.Limgrave sets the scene, with its rolling green fields, dilapidated buildings, and the imposing Stormveil Castle sitting atop its cliffy perch off in the distance. You could lose dozens of hours to the region alone, exploring its underground dungeons, scavenging for new items and upgrades, and fighting the weird and wonderful enemies that inhabit it. However, what was included in last year's Closed Network Test is just the tip of the iceberg.Beyond the comparatively ordinary borders of Limgrave lie otherworldly areas that wouldn't look out of place during the Blood Moon phase of Bloodborne. To the east are the toxic swamplands of Caelid, with a redraw sky hanging overhead. Meanwhile, the closer you get to the Erdtree in the north, the more magical the locales become.Some locations bask in the golden energy of the sun while others look like they've been pulled straight out of the grungy depths of the Valley of Defilement in Demon's Souls. All have their beauty, though, and it's an engrossing trek venturing through them all. Yet another masterclass in art design and direction from FromSoftware.Navigating The Lands Between is made a breeze through the inclusion of an in-game map and compass — a first for these sorts of games by the Japanese developer. Using your own intuition and curiosity, you can place markers and icons to essentially create your own landmarks, labelling places you'd like to visit in the future. The main path is highlighted by some Bonfires Sites of Grace, but that's all the guidance you'll get. It means you can casually wander into high-level areas, encounter a boss that's far too powerful for your current level, and lose all your Souls Runes. While there could be a touch of frustration after the ordeal, it's more about the knowledge gained from the daring escapade.Devoid of objective markers and Ubisoft style towers that mark activities and quests on your map, Elden Ring allows you to craft your own journey through The Lands Between. Find the places you want to explore and the enemies you wish to battle. Whereas the rest of the game will feel fairly familiar to FromSoftware fanatics, the open world and its endless opportunities provide a new, captivating way of shaping your own adventure.Comfort can be found in combat, which has been dramatically expanded upon to be inclusive for almost any playstyle. The standard sword and shield setup will always be viable, but now magical abilities are more important than ever. A wide array of spells can be cast to down enemies from a distance, with even more options sourced from Ashes of War. These are special skills attached to weapons that greatly expand your capabilities by offering a different kind of attack which can be called upon if you have enough FP (Focus Points) juice. From a magical greatsword to temporary wind attacks, what they provide upon activation can change the tide of battle.Furthermore, summons have been broadened to the point where you can call in some help from the item menu alone. Spirit Ashes are a new type of summon, calling upon the souls trapped inside. They take many different shapes: a pack of wolves, a skeleton army, or jellyfish just to name a few. Fighting on your side until their health bars are depleted, they're vital for combat encounters, providing distractions for the enemy while you either regain health or go to town with a barrage of attacks from behind.Elden Ring then borrows from Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice with some simple stealth mechanics that make setting up backstabs and getting the drop on foes much easier. Hide in the tall grass while an unsuspecting enemy passes by, or crouch across the battlefield to lower the chances a group of combatants notice you. You can even fight on horseback whilst riding your trusty spectral steed Torrent. Some enemies and bosses actually require that approach, since trying to fight them with your feet on the ground is basically a non-starter.With so many options to consider, combat has a genuine variety to it. You can take your build in so many different directions, prioritising the more magical elements of the game or committing your upgrade points to strength and dexterity. In between the two extremes lies a plethora of potential.Just like its predecessors, it's always going to be a difficult title. Timing your attacks correctly and managing your stamina gauge is the bread and butter of FromSoftware games, and Elden Ring is no different. It's what you do in between those attack patterns that truly shakes things up. Combining the traditional combat of Dark Souls with stealth elements of Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice and then throwing in some new ideas, Elden Ring feels like everything the studio has been building up to. This is FromSoftware combat at its peak; the definitive versions of its past titles all packed into one.Your skills with these weapons and magical abilities will, of course, be put to the test in gruelling boss fights. As is tradition, a lot of these encounters feature completely unique enemies with attack patterns exclusive to them. This is yet another factor that outperforms its predecessors thanks to some impressive mainline battles. Bosses dramatically change their weapons during phase changes and even go as far as to switch up the arena you're fighting in to suit their more powerful abilities.What's more, there's a frankly absurd amount of optional bosses in the game. Some simply roam the open world while others are hidden away in dungeons, caves, and catacombs. The only problem is some of them are just a bit crap. Either repurposed enemies from the mainland or posing little threat in general, they can be very hit or miss. And since there are so many of them, it can sometimes feel like they're just there to pad the game out a little more. The issue is nowhere close to being a Dark Souls II problem, but a bit more care and attention for these side battles wouldn't have gone amiss.The same can be said of the non-mandatory dungeons: the first few will be exciting ventures into the unknown, but you'll quickly begin to spot their quirks and general layouts. A lot of them begin to look the same the more you play, with a simple puzzle of finding a lever to unlock a door being the task behind a lot of them. They're enjoyable enough, but don't expect to find anything revolutionary down in their depths.Making up for that slight disappointment are the mainline areas, all of which are intricately designed with their own set of enemies and layouts. The ramparts of Stormveil Castle impose as you scale their outer walls before making it to the treasure-filled rooms within. Directly north of the fortress is a region drowned in water and ram-shackle dwellings. Next comes the Academy of Raya Lucaria, an enchanted place teeming with spellcasters. Every region feels distinct; every area has something to call its own. And when you can freely visit these places on horseback, crossing their borders within minutes of each other, it's tough to think of a more varied world.If you'd rather not bask in that scenery, though, a few quality of life improvements makes getting about the place much easier. You can fast travel from anywhere on the map to Sites of Grace you've interacted with — you no longer have to actually visit one in order to get somewhere quickly. Then there are the Stakes of Marika, which act as checkpoints for boss battles. Their inclusion eliminates the boss runs from previous games, where you'd have to run to the fog door from the nearest Bonfire. Now you can respawn right at the entrance and immediately have another go.However, where the game falls short is in its visuals and performance. There's no getting around it: Elden Ring doesn't look as good as PlayStation 5 launch title Demon's Souls. Bluepoint Games did an outstanding job remaking the 2009 classic for the modern era. In comparison, Elden Ring looks... fine? There's a clear drop in overall visual quality, but the art direction of FromSoftware shines through with some jaw-dropping scenes and environments.What isn't acceptable is the framerate. The game has two options: Performance Mode aims for 60 frames-per-second while Quality Mode improves the graphics. The vast majority of our playthrough was conducted in Performance Mode, and rarely did the title maintain a consistent framerate for any decent length of time. We're not talking dramatic drops that slow the game to a crawl, but rather constant little dips here and there which become a bit of a nuisance. While we just about managed to put up with it, you'll constantly notice the framerate dipping no matter where you are in the open world or what you're doing.Except there's more: persistent texture pop-in occasionally spoils the scenery. It happens most often when fast travelling to Sites of Grace, but can also occur when you're simply riding about the open world. It takes a second or two for the greenery at your feet to load in, and other smaller objects will suddenly just appear in the distance despite being able to see the landscape well beyond them. A common problem for open world games, but it's particularly egregious in Elden Ring.And then we have the load screens, of which there are surprisingly many. While they never last for more than a few seconds, they're plentiful enough to take you out of the experience somewhat. It's understandable when one is needed to fast travel across the world, but they also appear when all you need to do is cross a magical barrier using the key in your inventory. You're moving forward maybe three feet, but we suppose the title theoretically has to load in a new area at that point. It's not a FromSoftware game without some technical flaws, though, is it?But all is (almost) forgiven as you gallop across many of the late game areas, taking in their sublime vistas and downing the abnormal enemies within. Elden Ring only gets better the more you play, expanding its map boundaries and what you thought was possible. It just keeps going and going, never letting up for a second to allow comfort to creep in. While past titles have always upped the ante, nothing quite prepares you for the final few locales.Elden Ring is the definitive FromSoftware game. With a refined combat system packing new ideas and an open world perfect for exploration, it sets a new benchmark for titles of this ilk to strive for. This is the Japanese developer firing on all cylinders — far and away its best creation yet. Elden Ring is an utterly essential PS5 title.Excellent 9/10Scoring PolicyReview copy provided by Bandai NamcoPlease note that some external links on this page are affiliate links, which means if you click them and make a purchase we may receive a small percentage of the sale.

Nowadays, he can be found playing the latest and greatest PS5 games as well as supporting Derby County. That last detail is his downfall.Comments (257)Hi everyone, just to reiterate this is a review in progress. I received code last Wednesday, giving me just a week with the game. That's nowhere near enough time to get through something as big as Elden Ring.If you have any questions, though, feel free to copy me in and I'll answer them to the best of my knowledge.Update: We now have a final score!The hype is real!@LiamCroft Thanks for the review, look amazing and I'm very excited! Quick question - did you get the chance to try it out on base PS4 at all? I unfortunately still haven'tanaged to acquire a PS5, and was wondering if it runs acceptably on PS4. Thanks!Hmph. Strange how there's still pop-ins on next gen systems from cross gen games. I want to buy this but feel like I'd be breaking my law of not buying 2 full price games few weeks apart.Sure it will go down but 98 on Metacritic with 27 reviews for PS5 so far!@LiamCroft hi, as I've never completed any of their games and given up. Is this much more accessible and forgiving?ThanksI'll pass. Was hoping it wouldn't have that trademark insane difficulty. Thats a turn off for me personally that trumps all other good things about it.@LiamCroft I love to play ranged and plan to go with bandit and use summons as support and focus strictly on bows. Can this be done?Looking forward to digging into this one.And hey, I loved the crappy bosses in Dark Souls 2!!WILL THIS BE the first Souls game I finish???? Stay tuned!Never in doubt!Any Chance for a Day One Patch that might improve the FPS?Very much feel that it’s confirmed my fears about the side content. But that’s OK as long as the main quest of sorts is great fun. But then what’s the point of having the open world!If it’s like all the other souls games, I’ll have to pass. Really burnt out on souls-like games. I feel that the market has become oversaturated with these types of games lately.98 on Metacritic, oh God looks like I'll have to break my law and get this! Christ! Noooooooooo!Sounds like it’s shaping up well, though frequent load screens is a bit disappointing. I look forward to the final verdict and can’t wait to get lost in this world!@TheArt I think that score will come down a bit but yeah the initial scores are impressive. I thought it would come in a bit lower.Great… frame rate problems. If it’s anything like the network test on PS5 I’ll consider just playing on PC to be honest.I'll bite and get it. It looks amazing and From has never disappointed me.@BranJ0 I'm afraid I haven't been able to test it on a PS4.@code45709 I honestly don't think so. On top of the general difficulty, the open world is fairly vague and free-form. There's a lot to take in, especially at first. It's still a hard game.@jmac1686 Yep, that's absolutely viable.Maybe a day one patch will fix the tech issues and some of the load screens. I preordered this for my friends birthday present. I think he will be pleased lolSounds about like what I expected. A great game with some technical issues here and there. I'm a little sad to hear the side dungeons sound sort of similar to Bloodbornes chalice dungeons but oh well. Still looking forward to giving it a go whenever I get the chance!Was gonna wait for my physical copy to arrive on Monday before playing Elden Ring, but after watching just 2 reviews for this game, I won't be able to wait that long, so I'm just going to buy it digitally in a couple hours and start playing it the moment the clock strikes midnight, just as I did for Days Gone & Dying Light 2.How hard is it? Is it for Soulsborne veterans only or have they accommodated other gamers in its design?Not that I'd be picking it up anytime soon, already have HFW and Cyberpunk on the go with GT 7 out next week. Worth a punt when it's a lot cheaper or steer clear?@LiamCroft thanks for the reply👍I've just preordered 🤣@LiamCroft nice review so far. Keep playing itBased on what you said for pros and cons, it appears to be a 8/10 I think. Or a 9/10Oh, Elden Ring..10/10 for sure.97 on opencritic.Holy FMiyazaki da goDSo glad to hear they have not made it easier. Too many open world games become boring for the lack of challenge.Great review. Pre-ordered now. I was expecting those frame rate and pop in issues since they always have optimisation issues and this is much more ambitious. Honestly I take these issues in my stride like Elder Scrolls glitches lol.Wouldn't surprise me if the Frame Rate and loading issues were improved down the line. The end product ought to be looking at a 9/10 maybe. That's my hope anyway.Sounds awesome, can't wait to die over and over again on Friday!YUUUUUS so stoked!!!!@Hoovesforhands Same here, people need to learn these games sell and get their name because of the difficulty. Just don't play these and games like Returnal.@LiamCroft Thank you for the excellent review! How is the sound design, and are Ultra Greatswords making a return?I was expecting a 91 but bro...This game is for sure winning game of the year if we base it on the score.I have to play this in march. Gawd damnI may wait on getting the game until a little bit. Just started Forbidden West, but it does look like a fun game.@kyleforrester87 Yeah I know, but starting from 98 with 27 critics so far is a more than good look.@LiamCroft Is there a boss/npc/enemy called glaive master hodir? Even a item description?If they don't mention it we are gonna riot.Elden ring be like:""ahhh you ignorant slaves, finally taken notice (at my greatness) have you""@LiamCroft So as a Soulsborne newbie, is this game accessible enough for me? Or will the hard difficulty be a huge turn-off?@LiamCroft is the day one patch available yet?Just wondering if the issues are prior to this release. I saw DF post they arent doing analysis video until after the patchAs someone currently playing Demon's Souls (PS5) as the first From game I've actually stuck with (bounced off Bloodborne right quick) but NOT my first Souls-like (Ashen and Surge 2 were both awesome), my biggest concern is how obtuse the game's systems are.I do not appreciate the whole ""not explaining things and acting like it's a mystery"" aspect of DS. World tendency is never explained, weapon abilities are not explained, stats and their impact are barely explained. I don't find that stuff enjoyable. I don't like having to Google stuff every few minutes just to understand the basics.What I want to know is: how does Elden Ring fair in that sort of regard? I feel as though open worlds are best when the player clearly understands the world's systems and is let loose inside the playground to make of it what they will. But I don't want to be scouring the internet for answers to the basics. Has From gotten better in that regard?Removed - trollingOh thank you for this beautifully written review. I savoured every word. Also for making it an in progress review which is the right thing to do to… well enjoy the game properly. 😅I’m not bothered about performance issues. It was expected and never bothered me too much. I’m even probably going to try playing in quality mode and switch to performance mode only if I struggle too much vs bosses. Awesome stuff I hope you can enjoy the game more for a while. 👍🏻I’m not worried about the graphics… I think DS3 was flipping amazing-looking. True, Demons Souls is in another class but I’ve had equal fun with both games. I watched only 2 trailers and Elden Ring looks phenomenal.The frame dips are a bit crappy but I’m sure it’ll get fixed. I may play in the graphics mode just to avoid it but it’ll be hard to do given that all the other DS games I’ve played are running 60fps (except on Switch.)@MFTWrecks I agree that I had to use google to understand the weapon stats along with your character stats and how the hollow/human system worked, but everything else is pretty easy to understand.@LiamCroft Loved the review. Thanks for that.Is there a humanity or Ember mode like in DS giving you more HP and able to summon special NPC for main bosses?@invictus4000 @code45709 For anyone asking about difficulty SEVERAL reviews mention this is the most approachable FromSoft Souls-like yet. I think this 1 minute segment on the SkillUp review puts it best.https://youtu.be/gfcJv3oZNcc?t=335@mwatcher It's just as hard as past Souls games, and I don't think it's any more accessible than them either. If past entries have turned you off, I don't think this game will be the one that converts you.@JJ2 Thanks! For your first question: sort of. There are Great Runes you can equip that come with various bonuses for one life. Then they go away once you die, and are tied to the use of an item called Rune Arcs.For the main bosses I've encountered so far, there has been an NPC to summon most of the time. You have to find them in the environment and have them agree to help you, however.@LiamCroft
Good to know. Thank you. I feared there replaced by the spirits summons which now feel a bit useless to me considering they need investing in upgrade.@JJ2 “Also for making it an in progress review which is the right thing to do to…”Yeah, I have a lot of respect towards Liam for this. These are not games to rush in any way.Currently now the #1 ranked game of all time on OpenCritic.https://twitter.com/open_critic/status/1496511026912710661?s=21I appreciate the professionalism in not slapping a score onto the game without finishing it and calling it a day - other outlets certainly will.Cheers, and take your time.I'll pass on this one, I don't like high fantasy and I am not a fan of Souls-likes. Controversial opinions, I know, but I much prefer things towards the turn-based scifi RPG ilk. Why yes, I do love Xenosaga and wish Namco would do an HD remake....I'm definitely in the minority that sees this as another brown and gray Souls platter of frustration but I'm happy for those who can't wait to get playing, hope it meets expectations as I'm sure it was very competently-made if past games are anything to go by.Horizon just can't catch a break. First game right before Breath of the Wild and now the sequel right before Elden Ring@JayslowHorizon Zero AwardsHorizon Forbidden Awards.@themightyant thanks appreciate that 👍At 01:12 - damn that looks exactly like the High Wall Of Lothric area from Dark Souls 3, all it's missing is the fire breathing Wyvern.Sony: ""Hey Kadokawa, how much do you want for FromSoftware?""I had a feeling this was going to turn out really well. The past Fromsoftware souls titles did well too, but just judging by what ppl were saying after the network test and the final build previews, I knew this was going to be special.Removed - trolling; user is bannedLove it when enemies don’t scale so you can run into powerful enemies and get your arse handed to you. But does this conversely mean that you can improve yourself to reduce the difficulty of enemy fights? Hope so. I know it isn’t in the FromSoftware formula, but I like becoming godlike as time goes on and wiping the floor with everything.Why hasn't the shipping status on my preorder changed to out for delivery?!😂 Can't wait for this oneI'm afraid that the game isn't optimized for ps5 as almost all video reviews out there don't talk about haptics, loading times and performance..In contrary HFW was shredded for minor bugs that will be fixed in a matter of weeks.@AdamNovice Funny enough, Activision only got a game of the year award because of Fromsoftware.@thefourfoldroot ""but I like becoming godlike as time goes in and wiping the floor with everything."" have you played Skies of Arcadia? The weakest character in the game becomes a freakin' tank of destiny if you upgrade her along the right path. Fina achieves god-like status if you get Final Cupil, it's almost sad to see enemies getting thoroughly stomped by her (but not sad enough to not be hilarious when you one-shot everything).@Col_McCafferty At least Horizon will sell 20m unlike Elden Ring. I think they prefer that.@Col_McCafferty get over it""""Oh boy.I’m mildly concerned by the frame rate, as i’m still on vanilla PS4, but whatever.I’m gonna take the week.I’ve read a few reviews and one of them reckoned it was harder than any of their other games, including sekiro! I really hope that’s not the case- somewhere around dark souls 3 is about as hard as I can manage. That said, I can’t wait to start it.I bet Shuhei regrets more and more saying Demon Souls looked trash back then with each passing game.Should only let people that don't like Soulsborne games to review this one, expect if that was the case we'd be seeing drastically different review scores.Talk about preaching to the converted.🙄Should give God of War to people that only like Fortnite. BotW 2 to those that hate Nintendo. Call of Duty to people that prefer indie games especially if they involve lots of pretentious gameplay and has 'feelings'.Be an interesting experiment.😝@Col_McCafferty Elden ring is ugly ? you have to be trolling ..@shadow2k
Yes, Legends on GameCube, it’s one of my favourite games ever!@velio84 what goes around....😉The reviews are written by existing Soulsborne fans who tend to sneer at other types of games and gamers. As such they're completely without any merit whatsoever.@ArcadeHeroes I'm not who you're replying to but count me as someone who is turned off by the visual look of these games. I like the settings, ambiance and lore of the Souls fans but the endless shades of brown and gray in endlessly dark corridors just isn't for me. Not saying it needs to be Mario-levels bright at all, and I'm glad you dig it, but I also don't think it's absurd to not enjoy this style either.Removed - unconstructive@Roqka For what I have been reading from those playing on PC.... the optimization of the game is mediocre to say the least (with long loading screens, freezes, pop-in, and lots of frame-drops).Love FromSoftware, but I can't deny that most of their games, especially the PC versions, are usually badly optimized. They need help in the department to be honest. They need to improve their game-engine.@Col_McCafferty And our Horizon Forbidden West review was written by Stephen, who also loved Horizon Zero Dawn. This is just utter nonsense.Removed - trolling; user is bannedRemoved - unconstructive@LiamCroft Mine just updated. Maybe it's the day one patch.Removed - unconstructive feedback; user is bannedRemoved - trolling; user is banned@Col_McCafferty C'mon, man, that's a bit of a ridiculous take even if you're not a fan of this game.Please can we not derail the comments section with such ridiculous arguments? Let's just talk about the game, as per usual.Sekiro is one of the best games of all time and I haven't beaten it yet. A close second would be Bloodborne that I got the platinum. Looking to get Elden Ring eventually, might let cowboy get his walkthrough up first@LiamCroft are there any online related trophies like in previous dark souls games?@thefourfoldroot ah, a man or woman of culture I see! Skies of Arcadia is also one of my favourite games of all time, I own a PAL Dreamcast copy and an NTSC-U Gamecube one (flew to New York and bought it in Virgin Megastore on Times Square on release day oh yes) - I even modded my Dreamcast with GDEMU to preserve my discs and play it with an undub patch and VGA baked in (the PAL Skies is the only region that blocks the VGA cable) on an OSSC. Yes I really did go to those lengths to play it in the best format, and yes I am begging Sega does a PS5/XSX Unreal 5 full on remake.@rpg2000 Yup, no surprises there. I just figured on PC you can usually tweak some stuff yourself to improve things a bit.Removed - unconstructive; user is banned@LiamCroft Nice review. 👍 Read alot of it out loud to my wife. I pass on anything difficult but we got it for my kid for their birthday, they of the ""play everything on hard mode"" mentality, so we'll watch them for awhile until they get to a boss they take forever to beat. I'm pretty sure they'll handle all of the minibosses w/ aplomb.@get2sammyb Will you be live streaming your playthru on twitch? Not a fan of but I'd make an exception. 😉@Col_McCafferty You're coping hard. Not like this my brother.People who reviewed Horizon like those kind of games already.Why can't some of the reviewers like both types of games and decided to give Elden Ring a higher score.Dark Souls 2,3, Bloodborne, Sekiro and Demon Souls remake didn't get a 97 so where's the loop hole there?@Col_McCafferty@ArcadeHeroes He's in the 7 stages of grief. Miyazaki winning goty again.People seem to realy like games with no story, or a pretty obscure one. This is the case for From Software and Nintendo games also. Maybe everybody should just skip making normal storylines in games for high metacritic. 
Maybe it's just me, but i'm not compelled to play this game.
Bloodborne got me in for it's nice setting, cause I surely didn't make any sense of the story.O yay ... O yay .... the ring; is upon us.@Sil_Am That's the great thing about this medium though. No disrespect to games like Horizon and Uncharted but I am not personally all that interested in the ""moviegame"" experience that these games offer, whereas the story telling in stuff like Elden Ring plays to the mediums strengths.@Fragile If you're enjoying Horizon why would you stop? This will still be waiting for you after you've finished...So excited and i can see easily see it being a GOTY contender.GotY awards mean diddly squat, just like the Oscars.Elden Ring can win it all, won't change my opinion that it's a game for snobs.😝Shocking to some degree that the performance is still off from this developer even with a new console and them using ps3/ps4 era engine, assets, and ui elements.From soft needs to invest in a better technical team and process because this is clearly an fundamental problem for them. Those picking this up on PS4 are likely in for both a significant downgrade in visuals, massive amounts of pop in, and loading times worsened.As much as I love souls games, I do wish a more talented individuals would start a new IP in the genre void of the Fromsoft oversight in technical optomization.We know games can look better and run better and still include the game play and atmosphere.Removed - trolling; user is banned@rpg2000 If you expect for every PC port to be well optimized (meaning they outdo themselves for consoles because that's where they get most of the sales) you will always be disappointed.Harsh reality about being a PC master race gamer.@kyleforrester87 take it easyWas hoping this might be the Souls game to invite newcomers in some particular way, but it seems instead that this will be GotY for Souls fans and a gameplay curiosity for those of us that don’t “get it.” Would you say @LiamCroft, for us plebeians who find the combat and general gameplay of Souls games to be a frustrating bore, that the game is entertaining to watch? I am quite interested in what I have seen… outside the Souls gameplay, of course. Was waiting on the reviews before preordering, but now I’ve read enough to take the idea off the table, the 97 on Metacritic notwithstanding, and yet find myself wanting to try to enjoy the spectacle in some way.Same question as many others have posted: how is the difficulty compared to, say, Demon’s Souls and Sekiro? I rage quit those two after investing many hours: both the degree of difficulty and the nature of the difficult rendered them not worth my continued effort. By contrast, I enjoyed and completed Returnal: very difficult, but at least the repetition had variety. If Elden Ring is more like the latter, I’ll try it out; if it’s more like the former two, I’m gonna pass.@Col_McCafferty Fun fact most people what love From games also love Horizon, i pre-ordered both at the start of the month and will enjoy both this weekend. You can have your opinion doesn't mean its widely shared.I'm genuinely appreciative that the reviewer here did mention the technical issues and the repetitive nature of some of the side content because other outlets aren't saying anything about the technical aspects at all and giving this game a 10/10 Masterpiece level review when you can't even say it is that if it has such flaws.Especially for people going into this game on the last gen console they need to know that what they're getting into.So thank you for being objective and honest about some of the game's shortcomingsThere's really no need to compare Horizon and Elden Ring directly (and I'm not sure why it's happening?) Both are fantastic and both are on PS5 and PS4.It's a great month for new PlayStation games!Enjoy them both, or enjoy the one you prefer. Or don't buy either...Whatever, it's just video games! Have fun with them!@WallyWest same, and both are such different games in type, genre, tone, and mechanics.Going to have a blast with both despite both needing some technical refinements.@LiamCroft is the hunter(bloodborne) or shinobi(sekiro) playable classes? Or are there classes with similar play styles.Sorry admins for losing my temper! Long day in the office, hang over and not enough sleep @get2sammyb I think it's fine/fair and interesting to compare them in a mature way... if possible.@kyleforrester87 Of course! No worries!IGN went with 10/10 score for this, the reviewer apparently finished it in 87 hours...but if you read the review its more like a breath of the wild re iew its all he goes on about and compares Elden ring to.
This is a good review gives some bad points too which alot of other sites are not doing. Its just praise upon praise.Metascore 97Universal acclaimbased on 45 Critic Reviews...Awesome.@Col_McCafferty Man, you're taking the arguing to a new level. I'm glad the moderation recognizes long time users and doesn't ban them after the first 5 comments considered as trolling, I had a few nice discussions with ya.Could you make a thread or type your opinion on a thread, you're spoiling the fun. You're being a party pooper at this point.""We just need a bit more time to confirm those thoughts.""More like y'all are passing around the controller over there at PushSquare towers trying to beat that one stubborn boss delaying y'all giving it a score. 🤣🤣 @LiamCroft @get2sammyb @ShogunrokSo I take it the Embargo doesn't allow for reviewers to discuss any of George R.R. Martin's involvement with the game? I was kind of hoping that with a big writer attached, we could see just a bit more from the story and character department. I would love to know moreI've bounced off HFW already till they fix the pop-in, It's been terribly off putting for me. I'm hopping Elden Ring is not the same. at least this is a £40 game and not a £70 one. From reading/watching different reviews it seems that giving the player choice off when to tackle a curtain boss makes the game more accessible as the open world allows you to level up to the point bosses can go down a lot quicker. Also seems the summoning offers AI companions to aid players. I'm thinking I may get this on PC if performance issues on console are as bad after latest patch.Why They should let only insane dificulty? Why I can’t have the option to play at a lower difficulty? Will this make the game shallow? I guess i will play on pc version and wait for a mod with a normal difficulty, to enjoy the game.@RevGaming And EA with It Takes Two as well.@Fragile Oh really? That's a shame. @clianvXAi The game's world has correlation with the game's difficulty. It's Like Returnal.@AdamNovice EA won in 2014 though.@mwatcher There's going to be a learning curve, but since the game has infinite lives, it's more of a matter of persistence than anything else.@LiamCroft Superb review, thanks for this. Dare I ask about the platinum.....?@clianvXAi The game doesn't need an easy mode. It's made in a way where you can use tactics that make the game easier. Use alternate paths, items, summon partners and specters to help you. You need to experiment to see how you can overcome the game, if you don't then you are missing a big part of what makes this game so funThe lowest Metacritic review is still a 90 😗 which one is going to be that disgruntled stick in the mud who belongs more in the user reviews…@Lem1697 I agree, grinding to level up needs to be done that makes it a bit more manageable for me@LiamCroftJust wondered if there’s any duel sense controller implementation. Haptic feedback etc like there is in Demon Souls?@LiamCroft How is the invasion system for this one? Is it easy to avoid getting invaded? That's always been the one aspect I never quite enjoyed in previous From games but I'm curious how it works with the open world and all.Lol at 12:50 when he tried to use the health potion while backing away and the good ol camera obscured the wall and he got stabbed to *****. That brought back so many blood bourne traumas for me.@Korgon you can turn it off!@Logonogo Oh really? Did they confirm that? I know you can choose not to connect online in the previous ones but then you also miss out on the notes people leave which I love! So that's always been kind of a double edged sword for me in previous From games. If I could just turn of invasions and coop and just keep the messages on the ground that would be ideal!@Korgon It was mentioned in a review I watched but I am not sure if they just meant to imply that you could play offline, it didn't seem like it though! I like the messages too but I detest invasions and don't use co op so I usually just play offlineWith all the glowing reviews it's getting, I'm thinking it might be time for me to get into the Souls-like genre.Looks lovely for sure but as nice as it looks there isn't anything I haven't seen before. The thing is I'm completely burnt out from the Soulsborne genre and it's because of this I will be holding off on buying this game assuming I buy it at all. Dying over and over and getting stressed isn't fun for me anymore.In fact I'm more hyped for Kirby than anything on PlayStation so far 😅I really like your approach not scoring it too soon, but well we all know that'll be great. Since I've really had bad luck with preordering games on amazon (which I still did with this one), I'll try to get one tomorrow at a local retailer, they usually put them on the shelves the evening before release day @Gremio108 The Platinum requires you to beat roughly 30 bosses, get three different endings, and collect all of the spells.@LiamCroft ouch, goodluck 😁 tks for the review.@Lem1697 i’m sorry it’s just sound they put a lot oh hp for bosses, and they will likely have insanely attack to pretty much kill you in 2-3 shots. I will enjoy the game, but with some mod that will not take away my time to replay a boss for 100 times.@LiamCroft That doesn't sound too bad by From standards, at least until everyone realises it requires seventeen playthroughs, and fifty-six hours of killing the same enemy for a rare hat@JustPlainLoco the hype train has got me too im gonna download it goodbye social lifeall aboard the hype train yehaaaaaaaaaaaaaa@LiamCroft does it run ok on ps5 ?@grooverider This review in progress covers the PS5 version, with the last few paragraphs dedicated to performance.Let’s go!!! Pre ordered and pre loaded@invictus4000 Could not agree more. As interesting as the gameplay looked, that Soulslike difficulty is an automatic NO for me.@clianvXAi I love how the internet just really over exaggerates the difficulty of these games, the games are no where near as hard as you're making out. The people what complain about the difficulty of these games are those who never even tried or played them.@LiamCroft is there gear that has focus regeneration? The few casting videos seem to have you run out of Magic fast.@clianvXAi Adding an easy mode would defeat the purpose of these kinds of games. They're meant to be challenging, it's baked into the world, lore and atmosphere. And overcoming that challenge is part of the intended design experience@WallyWestThat’s not universally true. I “complain” about the difficulty/repetitiveness of Demon’s Souls and Sekiro, and I own and invested hours in them both.I hope they improve the frame rate if it’s hard difficult like the other Souls games.@TooBarFoo he literally said in the cons section that there is pop in lol. and elden ring is £60.@Channel42 HUH?@Jayslow unlike breath of the wild. souls games are niche and I doubt any of that will affect the sales or the hype of horizon. not to mention in 2017 horizon was a new ip and zelda has been established.@Fragileand what exactly makes you think that you'll be able to see elden ring through? you sound like you've never played one of these games in your life. don't let reviews control you. that's a unpopular opinion about Guerrilla though lol. they are certainly good story tellers.Sick of From Software and the poor performance. This is a deal breaker for me. Blue Point masterfully reimagined Demon's Souls at 60fps and it stuck that target. It was also the first Souls game I beat as all the others I got fed up of due to not having enough time to spend in the games.I may return my pre order until performance is sorted out. Strange that no other reviews mention this on console....@RevGaming game of the year is not based on who has the highest metacritic score lol. if you think that...you really haven't been paying attention@kyleforrester87 ""whereas the story telling in stuff like Elden Ring plays to the mediums strengths""so just because it doesn't tell an actual story and keeps you in gameplay all the time...it's playing to the mediums strength? lol nah I'd rather have my ""movie games"". love when ya'll say that...that's how you can tell your just trolls and haven't actually played them.@ArcadeHeroes it isn't ugly but it sure ain't pretty but then again no one goes to these types of games for graphics amiright@middyone what on earth are you talking about  it’s really sad but I’m going to have to start using the ignore function a lot more liberally. Have a good day!I think after the troubled start to the generation, the critics are desperate to praise. Almost post pandemic, with things returning to normal, Elden ring has no doubt come at the perfect time. I'm sure it's a great game for those that enjoy the Souls series, but ten out of ten and people saying it's a contender for greatest game of all time, I reckon that's all just a little bit over the top for a niche game, that isn't accessible enough to be for everyone.@kyleforrester87 lol do the cowardly thing I couldn't care less. that just justifies what I thought even more. that you just talking.Diving in 4 hours from now!!!!I haven't really enjoyed many other FromSoftware games, so I'm not that interested in this one at all.The George R.R. Martin connection doesn't have the draw it probably once would've had, too. I used to be a big Thrones fan.I will give it a look, however, but the names FromSoftware and GRRM do nothing for me 😕Early reports claim that the ps5 version is the best among all platforms..more than 10fps delta between ps5 and xsx..will have to wait for the inevitable DF analysis video..@middyone Thanks Cap.Obvious.@get2sammyb ""Whatever, it's just video games! Have fun with them!""How dare you speak such blasphemy on an internet comment section devoted to video games! Your credibility as a game journalist and console enthusiast are LOST!You are dead to us all.NOTE: JokeOn topic: Great review! I can't wait to get my hands on this game!I'm so going to get ripped apart for saying this... well might as well do it.I don't think this deserves such universal praise. Why? Well, let's start with performance.It's UNACCEPTABLE! People ripped Horizon: FW a new one for its visual glitches but are suddenly fine with this?! I'm sick and tired of gamers giving FromSoft a free pass when it comes to their shoddy, piece of sh*t engine that always runs poorly, no matter the platform.Animations haven't changed a lot compared to their previous games. Sure, they did add some cool horseback stuff, but controlling your character still feels floaty.(FOR SOME) No accessibility options for those who want an easier approach. And before you start roasting me with those generic ""Git GoOd!!1!"" jokes, it's actually possible to balance it. For example, why not give an option where you don't lose your money after you die? Or reduce the stamina penalty when dodging?Graphics are... yeah. Not up to today's standards but I won't criticize them too much because I play AA games all the time, so it wouldn't be fair of me.I never played it, but from all the reviews out there, I don't think this deserves more than a 7 at its current state. With performance improvements, it's definitely an eight out of ten.Of course, feel free to disagree. These are just my opinions and I know they don't reflect the majority.@Divergent95 I mean, I've bought the game (admittedly for a very reasonable £31) but I agree with the thrust of your comments.I'm expecting a good, hard as nails experience but the circle jerk around it is already kind of embarrassing.@MarkMarky Thank you! I'm not a troll or a toxic ""hater"". I'm just being realistic and the circle jerk needs to stop.@LiamCroft Any idea if there will be the first day patch?@Divergent95 I agree. I do think there is a way FromSoftware could still craft it's signature gameplay, but have SOMETHING in place for less skilled players.I personally like Nintendo's approach with many of its platforming titles - the developers WANT you to give it your best shot, but if you absolutely can't do it or you just want help, there is an optional power-up available to get you through the course after so many deaths.As far as the game engine...sweet God FromSoftware needs an update. I mean, from my understanding the PlayStation side of things fares fairly well - but FromSoftware has always seemed to show favoritism for Sony's consoles over the years from an optimization standpoint.I don't think FromSoftware purposefully makes other versions worse, it's just that, for whatever reason, it makes sure that framerates on Sony hardware are more solid than other platforms.For example: Sekiro. On PS4 Pro, it performed much better than Xbox One X because it was using a Checkerboarded resolution on Sony's machine and a native resolution on the Xbox side.Why? To what end?The power differential on Xbox One X over the PS4 Pro would have made the X1X version run the smoothest if it also used reconstructed resolutions instead of native resolutions.Maybe Microsoft's SDK at the time didn't support reconstruction the same way that Sony's does? It just seems like an odd choice.A similar issue happened with Kingdom Hearts III - the PS4 Pro version ran 1200p while the Xbox One X ran at 1600p. Guess which version ran at a more ""locked"" 60fps.It's as if the mentality is that the American machine wants to look better; but the Japanese machine wants to run smoother.I think the same issue is happening with Elden Ring - at least from the Network Test analysis that Digital Foundry did a little while back - the PS5 is running better than Series X, but that's because the resolution ends up being higher on the Series X.Why favor resolution on one console and framerate on another? It's just bizarre. If I am doing a toggle to Favor Performance...then favor the game's performance, no matter how much the DRS has to work to get that framerate.The only saving grace is that Series consoles can use VRR to help smooth things out. However, reliance on VRR shouldn't be a mentality when it comes to game performance.I had the same argument with Bethesda continuing to use its Gamebryo-based Creation Engine for years for Fallout and Elder Scrolls games. It just started to look tired and old wasn't really scaling well with new rendering techniques and hardware.I hope Starfield changes that with Creation Engine 2.Anyways, I hope, going forward, FromSoftware looks to either create/switch to a whole new engine or really takes the time to figure out how to better scale its engine across varying platforms. It's just starting to show its age - not to say Elden Ring looks bad, but the technical limitations are starting to show.Good review, and sad to hear it's not really that much more accessible. This will go into the ""shame I can't like Soulsborne"" pile I'll probably buy when it hits $30, play for an hour, then forget exists. @GamingFan4Lyf Technically Creation is just Bethesda's own heavily modded fork of Gamebryo. Way better, but it's still based on the same original engine. Though it's certainly not really the same thing anymore.Just read DFs initial comments - the performance is pretty appalling by the sounds of it - can't even hit 60fps in 'performance' mode on a PS5! Get ready for some lovely judder. And this is with the launch day patch, which reviewers didn't even have access to when they failed to mention this.Not sure why such jank gets overlooked. The circle jerking is strong with this one!Getting it on PC for smooth 60 FPS (according to some reviewers it only stutters now and then on PC).@middyone Yes, I know it was in the cons, that's why I am concerned. And Elden ring is £43 PS5 at Amazon and £39 on PC at green man gaming where I bought it (with discount link from Skillup review)@mwatcher We all were Soulsborn newbies at one point haha. If it's your kind of game, give it a try, I always thought I would never be able to play Dark souls, and here I am, having play them all. It's difficult, but nothing you can't achieve without trying and learning.@RevGaming let's see.""This game is for sure winning game of the year if we base it on the score.""""Horizon Zero Awards Horizon Forbidden Awards.""""97 on opencritic. Holy F Miyazaki da goD""""He's in the 7 stages of grief. Miyazaki winning goty again.""first of all if you knew that 1. you wouldn't keep bringing the score up like matters 2. you wouldn't be trolling about horizon. 3. you wouldn't keep bringing up goty.now troll cope. I doubt it's gonna win with horizon and god of war coming out but you can dream.p.s. this is what shuhei actually said ""What happened with Demon’s Souls was until very late in the game’s development, we were not able to play the game through. There were framerate issues and the network was not up and running"" if they had the game freaking done close to launch he wouldn't had said that lol. cope souls fanboy. it's a niche genre still.@Divergent95 I'm a huge fan of Demon Soul, Dark soul, Bloodborne and Sekiro, played them all AND I totally agree that some accessibility should be granted to this kind of games. I just want more people to be able to play and enjoy these games with us !It's a shame more players can't enjoy these games with us, because of difficulty (not all players have the time to ""git good"" because yeah, it takes time, and when you work, have a family, and actually want to play and/or have other hobbies it can be pretty time consuming)@Divergent95 I absolutely agree. the hypocrisy is real@TooBarFoo ""I've bounced off HFW already till they fix the pop-in, It's been terribly off putting for me. I'm hopping Elden Ring is not the same. at least this is a £40 game and not a £70 one.""lol you sure didn't see concerned. and horizon is not a £70. it's £52 at Amazon.@Danloaded Funny how people lose their ***** when someone ships a broken game, but when its a souls game no one gives a ***** about frame rate drops, pop in, and so on. This should have been solved before discs were made. For the hate other games get for this same ***** I don't understand why this is getting a free pass.@Divergent95 Exactly! How does this get such a high score when other games with the same issues are docked for it. Way too much bias coming into play with the reviews. Looks fun but based on issues I have heard described in every review it should be a 6 or 7 max just from technical issues. Too many fan boys@middyone Yeah. If we base it on the score, which it isn't the reality lol.You think I didn't know GoW got more awards than red dead, Horizon got more awards than Mario Odyssey?You're debating me for no reason.Yeah. Horizon got no awards (just like Spider-man), and it might not get one this year because it seems the competition is really really tough. It's totally possible. God of War could exceed in every category Horizon is strong in. You think zelda and gow are not hitting 90s? Atlus is releasing a major game. Starfield could be a huge hit. So I made a joke. Just a joke.The Miyazaki da gad is a joke, but he is though.Yeah. He's actually in the 7 stages of grief. I still see him complaining.No dude. You're the one that's coping lol.Idc either way. I gave hfw a 9.2, I'm hype for gow and elden ring too. Idc in the end as long as we get goty caliber games.I know it's niche. I already said Horizon will sell three times as much lol (20m vs 6-7m).Great review! Sadly I am terrible at Souls-like games, so I'll be waiting for this to dip down to $25 New during Nov/Dec 2022 or later.Damn, performance is bad... playing it now, and it's bad.Very choppy, constant drops in framerates, noticeable and affects game play for sure. Even in the tutorial area it was coming through. But in the open world it's constantly fluctuating on Ps5 fr mode. Which is apparently the most stable aside from playing the ps4 version back compatible.This is by far the worst performance I've seen in a from soft game (and we know it's not a high bar lol).I’m a little confused as to how a game that is this bad when it comes to performance is sitting at a 97 on metacritic.Can someone explain to me why these glaring issues are just pushed under the rug?@clianvXAiWeMod already has some up for PC 👍@FatalBubbles Because the game is just so much fun. It's like when you were a kid and performance really meant nothing to you, the game is just so damn fun apparently.@middyone You sound really angry. We are talking about games, nothing to get angry about.@lolwhatno how do I sound angry and why didn't you answer my other comment to you instead of going through my comments to other people?@middyone What comment, scrolled through the thread and didn't see you ever mentioning me.@lolwhatno That’s great if people we having fun with the game. That doesn’t explain throwing out performance issues to give it a 10/10. I had lots of fun with Cyberpunk and it had performance issues, so should I give it a 10/10?@Korgon Even offline you still get raided by cpu characters. Kicks you off the horse and what resembles a black phantom in Demon's Souls will chase you about.@Agramonte needed wemod for Hollow Knight but after Demon's Souls I feel I could handle it now.@AstraeaV I see well that's okay. I've dealt with it in past From games I'll deal with it here too. Thanks for the response.@AstraeaVI think everyone has different tolerance levels on when difficulty start to ruin a game for them (either hard or easy)Always good to know it is there before buying a game just in case.SaveWizard will probably have one out on PS4 also.I know a friend that brought DYING LIGHT 2, HZD FORBIDDEN WEST and then brought ELDEN RING on friday.. Are gamers [email protected]@@@ING sociopaths??!!@Medic_Alert I just don’t get it. From what I’ve read the game is borderline unplayable on PC and it has a 95 there from critics. It’s like they hyped this game up so much they’re afraid like you said to say “this game has major issues”. Critics destroyed Cyberpunk, Days Gone, etc for performance issues but FromSoftware gets the Nintendo treatment and people pretend like it doesn’t matter if a game has issues.Updated with a final score!@Medic_Alert nah. That's not true at all. If anything, everyone is too eager to criticize others.I almost finished Dark Souls 1 and bounced off of Bloodborne, but I'll buy Elden Ring eventually. When it hits the bargain bin and gets some patches to fix the fps.Hoping to finish forbidden west in the next couple of days so I can make a start on this! Doesn’t even matter that I’ll probably find it too hard to reach the end 🤣.@AFCC Still hanging there?@LiamCroft well played for getting through!Well done. I’ll drag this thing out over a yearI hope fromsoft squash the performance niggles quickly.This is my first FromSoft game and I'm in well out of my depth but so far absolutely loving it. The framerate drops and pop-ins are a tad annoying but not too bad. One of those games that doesn't come around that often (for me at least) where even when you're not playing it, you can't stop thinking about it and can't wait to get back on it.@Bingoboyop I would doubt about that..This doesn't feel like the best Fromsoft game personally as I felt more intimidation and awe in the tighter levels of previous games. But still a 9/10 in my books.@FatalBubbles it's not ""unplayable on PC"" at all. The frame rate is choppy at times, yes, but it's easy enough to keep a fairly steady 60fps, with a few dips here and there, but nothing lower than 30fps or so (which is what Bloodborne runs at whether you like it or not)The fact that the frame rates I get on a GTX 1060 (then minimum spec supposed to be able to play the game) is the same as what people get on a RTX 3080 though, is an issue as those guys should be locked at 60fps at all times really@Medic_Alert You sure are always on alert. You complain a lot! You just came from having issues with HFW, and now ER... I'm just saying if you're going to nitpick everything you're gonna have a hard time enjoying things. Like you said you're loving ER, people would also appreciate to read your likes more than your dislikes. 😉I made the plunge on ps5 and I’ve been loving it. I notice the pop in more than the frame dips, it rarely takes me out of the experience. 10/10 for me.Excellent review! I’m enjoying my play through immensely. Hopefully FS can fix the performance issues in a timely manner for those bothered by them.Edit: also, it’s cool how the reviews load up new pictures upon a refresh 👍 I haven’t noticed this until recently.@danlk1ng I’ve seen people comment with top of the line graphics cards that it goes under 20fps on boss fights and makes it unplayable. 🤷🏼‍♂️@FatalBubbles Yeah, it's weird. Top of the line GPUs will apparently struggle with it, but my aged GTX 970 from 2015 is handling it like a champ on low settings. Definitely still some hitches and visual issues here and there (shadows flicker a lot), but it runs well enough.@KundaliniRising333 Or maybe go for a better engine if it does not work why keep going down this road.I'd give it a 10/10 but fair enough, it has it's (mostly technical) issues and that should be accounted for  I'm 22 hours in, lvl35 and stuck at the first Big Boss. I'm absolutely enthralled by the game and it's world design and atmosphere. I already exlored the world a little bit (and mostly into territories where I shouldn't belong atm) and it's fantastic which wonders I've already seen. Really looking forward to git gud enough to enter these strange realms in the east... and underground 12hrs in, it's just as engaging as HFW, it's hard to put down when you start either. You just wanna explore, explore and explore!You cannot give Demon's Souls a 10/10 and Elden Ring a 9/10. It belongs in the 10/10 hall of fameLoading has been an issue for me. It's bound to happen when you die, and fast travel, and it only takes a second or two.@dr-gorgo Different reviewers. I wouldn't have given Demon's Souls a 10/10 either.@LiamCroft Hi. I’m glad you could enjoy the game. I don’t get the complains about loading screens though. There are many but it’s super fast to load on my PS5. So I don’t think it’s really annoying.Bought digitally and started on my PS4 as cant find the new console. As a fan of From's previous games, my first impressions are it's great, but I know I won't have enough time to properly play it for a while. Maybe by the time I finally find a PS5...@code45709 The short answer is, no.Well i'll give this a 9/10...its just superb and everythings been put on hold so i can just crack on with it..i'm in no rush to finish it and i think its going to be a long,long time before i'm done with it..i still play dark souls every now and then and dragons dogma gets rolled out for the odd weekend here and there but this is the best of both worlds so now i guess they are redundant for a while at least.i wish the frame rate was locked at 60fps but the more i play the less i notice..around the 30 hour mark and level 32 vagabond and i'm rocking a wicked uchigatana (blood slash) which helped destroy godrick the massive *****...why do i have to go to work?Awesome game. I initially started as Wretch and got around 11 hrs in, but felt super underpowered with some of the main bosses. I showcased the game to a friend whilst starting anew as Samurai, and haven't looked back since.
I'm now 13 hrs in with the Samurai class and G was a cakewalk this time (albeit I did find some pretty strong Spirit and Ashes of War to help me).This game is so addictive, just like other Soulsborne games. The open world exploration is out of this world.@danlk1ng not entirely true what you are saying there. Yes, even RTX 3080's are dipping in the game but obviously the GTX 1060 can't have consistent high FPS at 4K (with MAX settings) like the 3080 can...
My 3080 Ti runs 60FPS at 1440p without a problem, barring the obvious dips that all PC's are getting atm.@NeThZOR who even mentioned 4K? I'm playing in 1080p (even though my monitor can do 1440p - I can get 1440p at 120fps in some indie games, which is always very nice, but for the most part I play AAA games in 1080p)I take your point though, in that if the people trying to play on 3080s are doing so in 4K on max settings, that might account for the similar performance issues with a 1060 at 1080p on medium@danlk1ng I was merely pointing out that the frame rates are not the same (given like-for-like graphic settings) between the GPUs as you were saying in your original comment.
If that were the case then there is an even bigger problem with the game's optimization outside of the annoying stuttering.I feel like more reviewers should mention that the first 10 hours of Elden Ring are awful. It has the slowest start of any Souls game and it initially put me off of it.It gets dramatically better past that 10 hour mark. I am at the 25 hour mark and the game deserves all the praise it is getting. It is one of the weirdest games I have ever played.For me, it’s the fifth best FromSoftware game after BB, Demon Souls (PS5) and Sekiro, Dark Souls. That’s not to say it isn’t amazing, It’s still in my all time list of best games.@patronmacabre ""the 10 hour mark"" is incredibly subjective. I'm about 20 hours in and I've beaten Margit but otherwise have yet to do very much in Stormveil castle, I've mostly been just wandering around Limgrave, and having fun doing so.I'm assuming that you got further through Stormveil than I have after 10 hours, as I can't think of anything else that would have prompted the game to go more ""quickly""I'm still not understanding the loading screen complaint. Where are the load screens besides fast traveling and dying?I'm about 45 hours in; Level 40; started as a Wretch. I've pushed through Margit & Godfrey, have opened up & explored parts of 3 or 4 major map areas. Not sure how far I am, this game is big. I'm a veteran of DS1, DS3 & BB. My opinion thus far is that the game is a generation defining masterpiece.Regarding technical issues, I'm playing on a PS4 Pro with a 2TB 870 QVO SSD installed. This is probably one of the best setups to run Elden Ring on currently, so my comments obviously don't reflect all play states and I tend to be mostly tolerant of technical glitches, especially if the game is good. I've noticed occasional pop-ins, especially after resting @ a site of grace, mostly with the grass & at times with things in the distance. Once I'm going, I haven't noticed as much but that could be because I'm looking 10-ft in front of me to avoid being murdered. The only significant framerate dip I remember was just before I took out the Tree Sentinel on horseback; I'd gotten gud enough to charge in super close & time my swings and during one significant pass it briefly stuttered quite a bit. Nothing thus far has even remotely broken the overall experience for me. Load screens haven't bothered me either, and have been quick on my setup.I have noticed more issues, particularly with framerate dips & stutters when watching PC & PS5 gameplay streams...I also have a TCL 635 TV with THX Game Mode. I'm running the game in HDR, and had to tweak the settings, especially the brightness quite a bit in the beginning to get to look right, but the game looks great to me, although I know the engine is somewhat outdated. Which could be part of the reason for better performance on the PS4 since it's an older system too...Removed - inappropriate languageRemoved - inappropriate language@lolwhatno 20 hours in! So far so good, having a ton of fun@AFCC Ay awesome to hear! Good luck in the lands between, will buy the game on a sale (I'm on a budget).Point down at patches for me (if he doesn't kill you first lol!)@lolwhatno I am commited to go through with this one! I will tag you when I finish itRemoved - inappropriate languageI have played and finished all the soulsbourne games and I say this is the best game. There is such a better exploration element here plus you still get all the usual dark souls tighter sections. It's much less frustrating as well with the stakes to spawn at and more bonfires everywhere you can warp to easily.
One thing which is annoying is that first boss is a bit OP it takes quite a while and too many attempts to beat him I think, he is more a late game boss considering your level when you are meant to reach him, not sure why they placed him at the start.
Frame rate on PS5 is fine, they actually made it worse a little with the day 2 patch but it's not that bad, way better than playing at 30fps like on the older games.@jacktexan yeah the HDR is broken, like so many games these days. I have a $3000 43inch 144hz 4K vesa certified HDR 1000 beast of a gaming monitor and I had to turn off HDR, they need to patch it to add tweaks to brightness it's just too dim. It's much better playing in SD and tbh you don't miss much anyway. The only game I can think of recently that did HDR good was the Nior 2 remaster for PS5, even GT7 HDR is broken.@FatalBubbles I have a beast of a PC and I decided to get it on PS5 instead, most games these days that are multiple platform run like crap on PC for the first month. I have learnt the hard way and unless I see a review where they say the PC version runs like butter I always get the PS5 version if possible. This is the price you pay with PC games these days, you either wait for confirmation of good patch level or you suffer on release day..@Nepp67 exactly. There are no loading screens aside from what’s normal.Performance issues are overstated. Plays fine on PS4 Pro.I've played around 30 hours and genuinely think it's crap. I've been waiting for it to get better but it hasn't. An absolute dull waste of time. Am I playing the same game as everyone else???@Divergent95 deciding on a review score for a game you’ve never played is silly.People that fixate on numerical review scores being the be-all and end-all are so cringey. Same type of babies who review bomb games to “even the score”. Basement dwellers.The game is great. In my opinion it will be the game of the year. Expanded world with a lot of tasks. There will be a lot to play for sure. Especially that here you can buy this game really cheaply.

Elden Ring,Jason Rodriguez,PC Invasion,https://www.pcinvasion.com/elden-ring-review-pc/,"Elden Ring is almost upon us. Made by FromSoftware, Souls series creator Hidetaka Miyazaki, and Game of Thrones author George R. R. Martin, it offers an action-packed adventure set in an open-world environment that’s both wonderful and gruesome to behold.My experience, as I’ll detail in our Elden Ring review, is based on a 60-hour playthrough. However, this was only for the single-player component. I wasn’t able to try out the multiplayer aspect due to level differences and mismatched schedules. Elden Ring sticks to a tried and tested concept of which Souls, Soulsborne, and Souls-like fans are familiar — that of cryptic and weirdly vague plotlines. The exposition will give you a headache, as characters and tooltips start informing you of the “War of Kerfuffle” for the “Erdthing Graceland.”So, let’s keep it simple. You play as a Tarnished, a nameless blank slate who could, one day, become lord of the Lands Between. You get to select from 10 distinct classes, each with its own starting stats, weapons, and items. The selection includes the strength-focused Hero, casters like the Confessor, and the Wretch (akin to the Deprived from the Souls games). In my case, I decided to play as the Samurai (since you get a bow). I primarily focused on Dexterity for fast melee weapons and bow usage.From there, you’ll meet a vibrant cast of characters. There’s the witch, Melina, who serves as your guide at the start of the campaign. There are also characters that live in the Roundtable, which acts as the central hub. Things also get stranger once you encounter the gigantic Two Fingers, a vendor that’s a total husk, and a wandering witch.The goal is fairly straightforward: battle the five Shardbearers who hold Great Runes and become the Elden Lord. But, there are also some key twists along the way (which I won’t spoil in our Elden Ring review).From there, you set out to explore a massive, open-world landscape with several regions. You start in the countryside of Limgrave, with its lush fields and rolling hills. In a short while, you’ll gain a trusty companion, a horse named Torrent who’ll allow for faster movement and mounted combat.The main path will, eventually, take you to Stormveil Castle, one of the game’s Legacy Dungeons. Now, to be clear, mini-dungeons already dot the map of Elden Ring. Legacy Dungeons, meanwhile, are sprawling complexes akin to castles or labyrinths that will take hours to complete. These are also punctuated by multiple boss encounters that are part of the narrative arc.Your exploits will lead to Liurnia of the Lakes, a swampy region with foes that emerge from the deep. You’ll then arrive in the Academy of Raya Lucaria, with its corrupted wizards who are experts in sorceries. And, past this point, well, we’re actually not allowed to say what happens next.What I can say is that Elden Ring has one of the most intricately designed worlds that I’ve had the pleasure of experiencing. Countless landmarks, ruins, forts, churches, hidden pathways, and secret items can be found along the way. The level design is top-notch, with interconnectivity fills you with awe as you traverse and discover new places. Moreover, the atmosphere and visuals at certain parts of the campaign will leave you breathless. The pitter-patter of raindrops on grassy meadows gives a sense of serenity. Meanwhile, foreboding music and macabre scenes in darker levels fill you with tension.The meat and potatoes of Elden Ring, as with Souls games, is its combat mechanics. Fortunately, it delivers in a number of ways. You can equip multiple weapon types, shields, talismans, spells, and armor pieces. And you’re going to need those, as even regular enemies will pose a challenge.Nailing a perfect dodge for those sweet invincibility frames, or timing a parry for that bone-crunching hit, remains satisfying. Sneaking around to backstab or breaking an opponent’s guard leads to a vicious critical finisher. Casting spells for offense and defense are also a given.Likewise, enemy designs range from your typical medieval knights to grotesque horrors from dark fantasy tropes, such as the unbelievably creepy Scion or the hulking Guardian Golems. You might even come across the Baba Yaga Bell Turtle. That’s what I affectionately call the humongous walking “houses” with a tortoise shell and a clanging bell.As for bosses, they are immense, towering figures, many of which have instakill abilities that need to be avoided. For instance, Godrick the Grafter, the boss in Stormveil Castle, can deflect spells and projectiles when he’s channeling a whirlwind. Then, during the second phase, he starts wielding a dead dragon’s head as a flamethrower. Now, you’ll have to watch out for whirlwinds that also cause your character to burn. Later, you’ll meet those that are able to transform, some which call upon spectral phantoms, and others that crash down like a devastating meteor.One of the key facets of Souls and Souls-like games is that they’re often difficult and not for the faint of heart. Elden Ring also provides challenges as you progress, though there are features that facilitate a smoother transition for those who are just starting out.Similar to past games, there are NPCs who can be summoned for certain fights. There are also spells that let you summon beasts or spirits to damage and distract foes. Torrent, as mentioned, makes traversal a lot faster, and you’ll find Spiritsprings that cause your mount to reach new heights. Dungeons, too, always have a Site of Grace (i.e., Bonfire), so that you’re never far from where you respawn in case of deaths (which will happen a lot).These Sites of Grace provide a plethora of functions. There’s your usual method of leveling up by spending runes (i.e., Souls) and flask upgrades. Likewise, you can memorize/equip spells or change the skills of your weapons on the fly.Furthermore, though I wasn’t able to fully test most of the multiplayer functions, those who play solo online will still be able to see messages and warnings from other players. These can definitely help you out if you’re stuck or wondering where to go next. If you wish, you may also ask peeps for help or invade their realms for some PvP action.However, there are still a few issues with Elden Ring. The first is related to combat and difficulty or, rather, how the latter gets circumvented by cheesing. To be fair, past titles do have cheeses. Sadly, in Elden Ring‘s case, this is further exacerbated by its open-world nature. Because bosses have an aggro range and they don’t replenish their HP (unless you die or rest), it’s possible to just buy a lot of arrows and snipe targets from afar. Of course, you could just fight them normally, but there’s almost no need to avoid a hassle-free method.Another issue comes in the form of weapon skills, or Ashes of War. While you’re able to assign a new skill to your weapons, this is limited by a system that only lets you use one skill (even with two different keybinds). For instance, if my sword can create magical blades and my shield can parry, only the parry can be activated with the keybinds. As of now, I still haven’t figured out a way to use two skills for a one-hander and shield setup, and I’m not even sure if that’s possible. Speaking of keybinds, the same button is used for your flasks/potions, summoning spells, lantern, and horse mount. It would’ve been better had these been separated for PC users.Lastly, there are some notable performance problems. To be fair, I can achieve 50-60 fps with an Intel 10900K, Nvidia RTX 3080, and 32 GB RAM, all while playing on the highest settings at 4K resolution. Unfortunately, micro stutters and framerate drops can be fairly troublesome. They only last a split second, but they’re sometimes jarring when they occur as I’m crossing cliffside paths or fighting bosses. I’ve also encountered three-second freezes, though that’s mostly because of taking several screenshots via Steam. You can learn more in our technical review.In the end, Elden Ring still manages to triumph against all odds. Its campaign remains challenging for veterans of the series, while also being accessible to newcomers who are getting their feet wet.Elden Ring sets the benchmark for future open-world games, with regions that you’ll delve into with fervor. You’ll gallop past majestic scenery, plumb the depths of crypts in search of secrets, and climb to the highest peaks to vanquish bosses. Not once did I feel that I was going through the motions or that the design is formulaic. FromSoftware truly has crafted something memorable and phenomenal.Elden Ring is a spectacle and a marvel to behold. Although there are some issues, the overall experience remains deeply engaging. It's one of the best open-world games I have ever played.About Us

Elden Ring,Mark Steighner,COGconnected,https://cogconnected.com/review/elden-ring-review/,"Let’s not bury the lead here: Elden Ring is a certifiable masterpiece. It’s both an elegant refinement of FromSoftware’s design philosophies, and an audacious step forward. Filled with drama, humor, melancholy, wonder and awe-inspiring moments, it also has, hands down, the best and most refined combat of any action RPG. By far the developer’s most assured game, is Elden Ring the gateway drug to the Dark Souls franchise that it’s intended it to be?For anyone who is a fan of FromSoft’s games, Elden Ring will feel both familiar but almost shockingly fresh. It makes early games like the original Dark Souls seem unrefined and claustrophobic. Elden Ring pulls together all the best ideas from the prior games and brings them entirely to fruition, and then places them in the context of a spectacular open world.Some open worlds, like in the recent Horizon Forbidden West, exist as elaborate set dressing for a relatively linear story. In contrast, Elden Ring’s open world invites the player to be a genuine explorer, and discover – or not – the narrative along the way. There are clues everywhere. In fact, every NPC, enemy, structure and object contain some of the story’s DNA. It is impossible to waste time, as every moment yields something useful. While it might be possible to temporarily lose the narrative thread, getting lost is just a happy excuse for more exploration. Getting stuck in too challenging combat is a chance to poke the map in a different place.In terms of size, The Lands Between might not be the largest of any open world game, but it is certainly the most dense with objects, enemies and incidents. There is a map, slowly pieced together region by region, but this isn’t a Ubisoft map cluttered with make-work tasks. Nearly every one of the dozens of NPCs has a quest but you won’t find the objective on the map. The destination isn’t the point, after all.There is an immense variety in the biomes in the major regions, each with specific enemy types, architecture and lore. The starting area of Limgrave is bucolic and impressive, filled with caves, dungeons, mines, and secret areas. It sets the template for what’s to come. In a sense, Limgrave is an extended tutorial area that’s bigger than most other games. It teaches the player what to expect from the rest of the map. In addition to having a Legacy Dungeon and un-skippable, demigod boss, each area of the map fills in a new part of the narrative. While some of the map is locked behind these requisite boss fights, a great deal of it is open from the start. You can spend many hours exploring and leveling your character before facing your first requisite boss.Elden Ring solves the problem of moving painlessly around the world by giving the players many options. Checkpoints, called Sites of Lost Grace – the Elden Ring version of Dark Souls’ bonfires – are ridiculously plentiful. Players can freely teleport between them. Sites of Grace also have a subtle, glowing trail pointing the player to the next important location. There are also hidden portals that transport the player to distant and unexpected locations. Sometimes, these are immense hidden areas that exist out of time and outside the map entirely. They can even be deadly traps from which it is difficult to escape.Unlike past Dark Souls games, verticality is hardwired into the world, and Elden Ring gives players several tools here as well. First, players have a horse called Torrent, allowing them the ability to cover large distances and even fight effectively on horseback. Torrent can use swirling pools of wind to leap impressively up the sides of cliffs. In a first for Dark Souls (though not for Sekiro), players can jump. It seems like a small thing, but it feels great to explore in a new way.Some open world games feature “emergent gameplay,” where a game’s systems interact in unexpected ways. Not Elden Ring. Everything in this game is intentional and precisely placed. Every sightline, enemy placement and environmental clue has been considered. What’s different in each playthrough is the player and their specific build, abilities and choices along the way. Based what you find and the path you take, much of your specific journey will be unique.If there’s one thing that Soulsborne games are known for, it’s their combat. Of course, each game in the franchise has changed things up. Some of the games emphasized parries and defensive play, others pushed players to be more aggressive. In Elden Ring, FromSoft has taken the best mechanics of all the games and added a few new ideas that players will love. There are new jumping forms of light and heavy attacks, and horse mounted versions of them. There is a new guard counter that rewards simply blocking with the shield or weapon. Power-stancing with two of the same weapon type returns from Dark Souls 2.Combine over a dozen possible offensive or defensive moves with the ten character classes and hundreds of weapons, sorceries and incantations and the result is combat that rewards every play style and level of experience. In Elden Ring, players can also add Ashes of War (basically, weapon arts) and call on spirit summons to aid them in combat. Calling on human players is easy, too, and Elden Ring makes cooperative exploration painless.As in many of FromSoft’s games, human and boss enemies have access to the same moves and powers that the player has, making boss and mini boss fights as challenging as always. Elden Ring has some of the best and most memorable boss fights in the series, and there are very few, if any, gimmick bosses with an obvious weak spot. What’s different is that, except for the main story bosses, many of the boss encounters out in the world can be skipped or run away from, to be attempted later. Elden Ring borrows Sekiro’s stealth mechanic, making it possible to sneak past many enemies or to approach them unseen for a backstab.Given the size of the world, the catalogue of human, animal, magical, and monster-type enemies is immense. As always with Souls, even the weakest foe is capable of killing you, should you not play skillfully. At the same time, every enemy encounter is satisfying and rewarding.While Elden Ring still has an enormous number of opaque systems to understand, moment to moment, it’s the easiest and most immediately accessible game FromSoftware has made. We’ve talked about the ease of movement. Elden Ring adds crafting in a smart way, allowing players to make basic consumables out in the field. Every Dark Souls game has had a hub area. Elden Ring has the Roundtable Hold, which is outside the map proper. It’s home to a number of important class trainers and NPCs and holds keys to the game’s story. In Elden Ring, players no longer need to return to the hub to level their characters. They can do so at any Site of Grace.The Souls games have a reputation for being punishing, especially for new players. Elden Ring is still a very challenging game, but the difference is players can often bypass difficult enemies until they are ready, and there are plenty of worthwhile things to do as they prepare. Although the immense and labyrinthine Legacy Dungeons provide the classic Dark Souls experience, small things like Sites of Grace adjacent to boss arenas take some of the sting out of repeated attempts. As with all FromSoft games, players will still need to keep an eye on stamina and health during combat. But out in the field, just exploring, stamina is of no concern.Elden Ring’s world-building and story design are at least in part the work of novelist George R.R. Martin. It’s characters and lore are firmly in the tradition of other Souls games. The narrative — and your role in it — is told indirectly and it is gratifying to piece the puzzle together as you go. In your quest to defeat the demigods, you will meet a wide range of NPCs. Some are weird, some are dishonest, some are noble and almost all of them share the melancholic feeling that pervades the world. Without giving anything away, there are more than a few moments of real emotional richness and depth.Compared to some recent games, Elden Ring is not a bleeding-edge showcase for the latest graphical effects. Nevertheless, its art direction is immaculate and spectacular. Every area is haunted by relics of a long-past age. It is always interesting to look at and often beautiful and awe-inspiring. New to the series is a day and night cycle that changes the monster population, lovely weather effects, and a head-spinning variety of architectural styles. Elden Ring has the most extensive character creation tools in the Souls series. It’s a large leap forward and a lot of fun to tinker with.Elden Ring’s music sets a new high mark for the franchise. Composed by Yuka Kitamura, it ranges from powerful action cues in the boss fights to genuinely unnerving, tension-filled orchestra textures in the dungeon areas. The music in the open world appropriately reflects the tone of the landscape. It’s also a cue to impending combat. Environmental audio and voice acting are equally effective.The game’s minimalist UI is intuitive and especially unobtrusive. Veteran Souls players will need to add some new controller assignments to their muscle memory.On PS5, graphics options are relatively limited. There is a choice of performance or graphics modes and a few HDR settings. There were a few minor issues with scenery pop in and lighting out in the world, but nothing that seriously degraded the experience.Developer Hidetaka Miyazaki stated that Elden Ring is the most accessible game in the Dark Souls franchise. It’s unassailably true. Elden Ring has more quality of life improvements and features than any game in the series. It offers the widest range of approaches to combat and exploration. At the same time, the combat can still be extremely challenging. Elden Ring has a lot of gameplay mechanics that aren’t always explained. The narrative is non-linear. Souls veterans get this storytelling style but brand new players might not. For fans of the series, Elden Ring is like several years’ worth of Christmas and birthday presents rolled into one. As approachable as Elden Ring is, new or impatient players might be overwhelmed.Elden Ring is not a literal follow up to the Dark Souls series. But players of Darks Souls, Bloodborne and Sekiro will feel some comforting deja vu. We won’t call it recycling, but some of Elden Ring’s boss designs, move sets and environments have been seen in some form before. All the favorite Dark Souls tropes are here, too: healing flasks, ambushes, secret areas, shortcuts and more. It’s still ridiculously addictive, and the open world just makes it more so.Elden Ring is an awe-inspiring achievement. Both a summary and bold step forward, it fuses FromSoftware’s best and most effective ideas with an endlessly engaging open world. Its combat is the most refined of the series, challenging yet accessible to new players. Elden Ring includes an incredible amount of quality content. More importantly, it offers a captivating, polished experience fraught with danger and filled with beauty.***PS5 code provided by the publisher for review***Developer: FromSoftwarePublisher: Bandai Namco"
