Link Official site ""When in doubt, burn 'em out!"" sounds like a line from Apocalypse Now, but in Monster Hunter: World your plucky sidekick shouts those words after steering a massive airship into a festering swamp of rotting carcasses. The biome is so large and regularly resupplied from the bountiful coral jungles above that it's developed a unique ecosystem supported by errant corpses fallen from the sky. It is disgusting and beautiful. You've come to make camp, kill the survivors, and make cool clothes from their skin. Monster Hunter: World is a third-person action game about dominating the food chain and looking good doing it. It's renowned for its endgame grind, where you go on ever more complex and challenging hunts across diverse, tangled open worlds in search of rare items needed to craft an armor set that’ll no doubt crown you the min-max champion of the world. But Monster Hunter’s essence and greatest strength are its tense, desperate, and tragic fights with beautiful beasts that can go on for the better part of an hour.It is also about the gleeful colonization 'new' lands and the slaughter of native species. Monster Hunter is a grotesque fantasy, but if you can stomach the merciless, repeated slaughter of god's beautiful dragon children, you'll find an excellent, endless action game that tests reflex and intellect in equal measure.Unlike the story, murdering World's dozens of intricately designed monsters has a point. There’s no leveling up and skill point allocation in Monster Hunter, so crafting armor and weapons is the only way to permanently buff your stats. Gear crafted from monsters reflects their strengths and weaknesses, so if you’re having trouble with a thick-skinned fire type, you’d best go take down the thicker, hotter Ratholos for fire-resistant armor, and maybe seek out a poisonous monster for a weapon that does a bit more damage over time. Clear affinities between behavior, aesthetic, and the hard numbers that govern monster stats make deciding which monster to hunt next and which gear you’ll need to ruin them relatively easy to determine, though a few endgame fights might require some careful menu digging.An anjanath 'drinks' a 'health potion'. All 30-something monsters (with more on the way via free updates) have distinct personalities brought to life through realistic animation, observable behaviors, and detailed models. My favorite, the Paolumu, is a fuzzy pink and white bat creature that balloons like a blowfish when threatened. The Kulu-Ya-Ku is a big dodo bird that uses big rocks as its first line of defense. The Anjanath, a fire-breathing, chicken-winged T-Rex, would be the final boss in most games. Hitting one until it stops moving for the first time is an immense, sad accomplishment. And then a Rathian plunges from the sky and captures an Anjanath in its claws, flailing your former final boss monster around like a ragged teddy bear. Somehow, they get bigger yet, with creatures that resemble fallen, very grumpy gods.  Gods or dodos, hunts work the same throughout the entire game. You ‘post’ a quest in Astera, the busy hub area, eat a quick meal to buff your stats, and if you’re playing with friends, you and up to three others embark to a particular biome. From there, you’ll wander an intricate environment in search of your monster. Scoutflies, sentient compass bugs, will point you to nearby crafting materials and monster tracks, always nudging you towards an inevitable fight. Problem is, biomes are populated with monsters besides your target, and they’ll probably interrupt your fight. Letting them duke it out while you hide can work in your favor, sure, but staying out of the way isn’t easy. Environmental hazards complicate hunts further. Do you try to lure an Anjanath beneath a massive boulder strung up by vines above? Loosing it with your slingshot could flatten you too.It's like ASMR, but with swords and dragons. Monsters have no visible health bar, but they’ll appear tired and increasingly scarred the weaker they get. At certain intervals, they’ll make a break for it and try to find a place to sleep or prey of their own to eat in order to build HP and stamina, turning hunts into frenzied chases. Knowing your environment, where the monster might be headed, and the fastest way to get there only comes with experience. When you can walk the line and land a rare, righteous combo directly on a Rathain's scaly dome, the feeling is euphoric.That’s OK because World’s combat is strongest when it feels like a struggle. Swings with the greatsword take literal seconds of animation, the hammer requires getting too close for comfort, and even the mobile ranged weapons feel like unwieldy, clunky machines. I’m partial to the switch axe, a weapon that stores elemental damage in axe form and releases it in explosive bursts after transforming into a glowing sword the size of a teenager.It still looks tiny to a burrowing sand wyvern or electric flying squirrel lizard. Big sword or not, you can and will get poisoned, paralyzed, burned, stunlocked, put to sleep and become subject to every attack your quarry can muster while you're helpless. Swings and shots from your friends can interrupt your own, and your every attempt to exhaust your movement abilities will also exhaust your character. For example, if you jump while sprinting to dodge an attack, your character will always leap forward and fall flat on their face. Remember: this is not your house, and you are very small. Combat isn’t fun in the way it is in Dark Souls or Devil May Cry, which reward constant, fluid combos and perfect timing, but it is always tense, and often hilarious. And when you can walk the line and land a rare, righteous combo directly on a Rathain's scaly dome, the feeling is euphoric.But so much gets in the way of that crunchy feedback loop. If the intent of crafting and gear management (the usual downtime activity between hunts) is to make you feel as if you've cultivated food, curated your looks, and performed the proper research required to take down whatever big boy is next on the list, then abstract menu interactions aren’t the most inventive or satisfying way to go about it. Not quite a perfect port, World is a deceptive resource hog that likely won’t run at the high framerates you’d expect it to. You can read the full rundown in our performance analysis. But it is stable, and built with PC users in mind. Fully configurable keyboard and mouse controls are as cozy as any controller, and extensive graphics options will get it running just fine on older rigs with enough tweaking.  When the hunting portion of Monster Hunter is so vividly rendered by massive, believable creatures and lush environments, digging through menus to turn herbs into potions and potions into mega potions lacks the same ceremony. It's fine, in the end, because the menu interactions are streamlined enough that they're not impossible to parse and rarely tedious. Still, for as busy and complex as the crafting and item management appears, it’s painless in practice, simplifying the series’ formerly complex systems to such a degree that they don't even resemble the systems they're simplifying. Why not reinvent them at this point? Monster Hunter: World also opens by bashing you over the head with text-heavy tutorials. You'll learn how to craft dozens of items immediately, most of which won't matter until a dozen hours in. Nearly every character in the Astora hub spews text about economies and changing item types, placing the fantasy of preparation on equal footing with filing taxes. Vital tips are glossed over too, like how you can use piercing pods to prevent monsters from running away, or how to craft some of the most essential items. I appreciate withholding information from the perspective of a role-playing hunter, where only battle-hardened vets will have obtained the most arcane knowledge. But the bulk of World's inner workings are only accessible through wikis and hearsay, the assumption being that you'll figure some stuff out on your own, or collapse and turn to Google.In the early hours, all you need to know is how to swing and dodge. It’s only when high rank missions are unlocked that you’ll need to do some research. It doesn't take long to kill most of the monsters and try a few weapons, so World complicates and extends itself by focusing on minutiae. It's why many will tell you that 'the real Monster Hunter' doesn't start until you finish the campaign. The first 20 hours of low rank play are fun and worth seeing, but to an extent it's true. World changes significantly in high rank play. Hunts are remixed by adding layered objectives, like defeating multiple monsters in a shortened time frame or by juicing the elemental abilities of a previously weaker monster. New monsters continue to appear in the endgame, often requiring raid-like planning with a full team of four. As you progress further into high rank missions, small mistakes are met with massive punishments, and the study and preparation for a single hunt might require a whole new armor set and weapon. Every weapon has a sprawling development tree.  It can be frustrating and slow, especially after the breezy hunts of the story campaign. And yet, every challenge is a natural extension of the combat system. Grinding out the best gear for a tough hunt is a smart, often necessary, idea, but if you know when to swing and when to run, you'll be alright.  High rank missions read like an artificial way to extend interest in Monster Hunter: World, but the series has always been preoccupied with grinding for obscure components to make a hat or sword with a difficult hunt in mind. It is Min-Maxing: The Game. Grindy, yes, but the grind is good. With so many modern games competing for time as much as money, Monster Hunter: World avoids feeling like an insatiable black hole by automating the usual busywork. Bounties, small collection missions you can often complete during hunts, grant you items and upgrade materials. A greenhouse in the hub area allows you to cultivate herbs between missions, eliminating the need to collect them at all, eventually. The Tailrider Safari is a group of three adventurous palicos you send on missions to retrieve a random assortment of items from specific biomes, softening the need to grind out lower level hunts. And every armor set is unique, pulling in recognizable elements from the monsters they're made of, arranged in eccentric, stylish, extremely anime designs. They are worth the effort. Like your character, Monster Hunter: World dresses its breathless combat in every assortment of the most arbitrarily complicated garb, all in the name of variety. It is an abyss of 'replayabilty’, an exercise in patience and observation for the ultimate payoff: an infinite black sea of invigorating dragon murder. And a new hat. Monster Hunter: World’s thrilling fights with fantastic beasts never get old, even if they require tiresome item management during downtime.James is stuck in an endless loop, playing the Dark Souls games on repeat until Elden Ring and Silksong set him free.

Monster Hunter World,Martin Robinson,Eurogamer,http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-01-25-monster-hunter-world-review,"Dragon's breath of the wild.
There are plenty of mightier, meatier monsters to be found out there in the wilds of Monster Hunter World's Astera. Like Tobi-Kadachi, the mutant squirrel bastard who'll stun you with the spark in his tail as he leaps from one tree to another, or the fire-breathing Anjanath who'll happily one-shot fledgling hunters. Later, there are the grand towering Elder Dragons that'll knock you this way and that as you whittle away at their generous pools of health on hunts that sap up the best part of an hour, all before you pick yourself up from the forest floor, dust yourself off and, like a kid stepping off a rollercoaster, say to yourself let's do that again.But still, it's the humble Paolumu I've ended up loving the most. A mid-tier monster who prowls the Coral Highlands - a stunning otherworldly tangle of clashing pinks and purples that looks like it's been culled straight from some 60s sci-fi gem - Paolumu is a masterpiece of offbeat imagination told through exquisite design and animation. A cutesy flying wyvern with a neck that can puff up until it looks like a child's swim ring, the Paolumu is a bat/hamster hybrid who's a joy to fight. I spent half a day happily dancing alongside them and repeatedly slaying them, just so I could plunder their remains for a full kit of gear; a fluffy number that serves some campy Barbarella fierceness. There are sturdier, more useful armour sets out there, but that's not really the point of Monster Hunter. It's all about doing things with a little bit of class.And Paolumu gets to the very heart of why I love Monster Hunter; it's silliness delivered with an awful lot of style, and all built around one of the most compelling loops you'll come across in gaming. Hunt monsters and strike them down, so that you might craft trousers from their carcass that'll help you best other, greater beasts whose corpses can then be used to craft more powerful trousers still. Rinse and repeat, until you realise you've clocked up a good 100 hours and found yourself looking at the family cat, wondering what kind of perks you might earn if you skinned them and turned them into a hat.Monster Hunter World, which serves as the foundation for the fifth generation of Capcom's series, doesn't change any of that. At its very core this is the very same Monster Hunter, and in many ways it's a more streamlined affair than we've become used to in recent years. After the dizzyingly broad variety box that was Monster Hunter Generations - itself a compilation of sorts that brought the fourth generation of Monster Hunter to an end - it's even a relatively slight offering. Gone are the Hunter Arts, and there are no new weapons added to the 14-strong roster. In Monster Hunter World, the very kernel of the series goes largely untouched.Which is well enough, really, given how wonderful that kernel is, and Monster Hunter World at least makes an effort to open it up to all. To say it's accessible might be a slight overstatement - it's quicker to get new players into the thick of the action, though it's still just as quick to knock them back on their arses a few hours later and several key systems remain unexplained throughout - so perhaps it's best to say it's undergone a fair amount of modernisation, and now lags only slightly behind its contemporaries.  Monster Hunter World, in a first for the series, is releasing around the world on the same day. There are clear perks to that - and in a neat touch, servers are now global too, meaning we can fight alongside our fellow Japanese hunters - but also pitfalls too. Prior western releases have typically been the 'Ultimate' versions of the game that come a year or so after the original release, complete with 'G-Rank' - Monster Hunter's endgame in which the biggest challenges, and the biggest rewards, are to be found. There's no G-Rank in Monster Hunter World, though that's not to say it's short on challenge or things to do - you're looking at around 50 hours to see through the main campaign, and there are also tougher variants of existing monsters available should you be up for the fight as well as an arena. Capcom's going to continue supporting Monster Hunter World with updates for the foreseeable future, and it seems likely that G-Rank will come as part of some future paid expansion, perhaps to coincide with the PC release later on this year. There's an all-new training area where you can learn the intricacies of the hunting horn, or how to become more effective when wielding the hammer. Out on the field, scoutflies will now guide you to your prey once you pick up their trail, doing away with the headless dance that preceded the majority of hunts in older versions of the game. Progress is now more parsable, with single player and multiplayer combined and a clearer through line piecing together the campaign. The difference between Monster Hunter World and its predecessors can feel profound, though it says a lot about how impenetrable these games once were when the fact you no longer have to look up online what key quests you need to complete to move things forward is something worthy of praise. To say that this is all simply Capcom opening up Monster Hunter to a broader audience is doing it a grand disservice, though. Elsewhere, there's a reinvention of a long-standing series that's just as radical in its own way as Nintendo's Breath of the Wild, and just as effective too. At the centre there's that same taut combat - communicated with such fidelity it feels perfectly at home on the big screen - though Monster Hunter World's real trick is building outwards. The clue is in the title, really, and Monster Hunter goes to great pains to draw you into its environments. They might not be as plentiful as before, but they're certainly more detailed. Areas such as Wildspire Wastes and Ancient Forest are impossibly dense arenas, offering up seemingly endless warrens it's easy to get lost in. Each map is now one seamless whole, with the loading screens that used to divide individual areas now excised completely.  Each area is now thick with secrets, and with little tricks that can be used to help turn the tide in your favour during any particular hunt. There are traps to be sprung, beasts higher up the food chain to be summoned to help your cause and all manner of tools constantly at your disposal. Monster Hunter World is so crowded with ideas, and so liberal in their disposal, that it maintains the ability to surprise even after scores of hours worth of play.  In Monster Hunter World exploration is a reward in itself, in which you can partake in an expedition - the new open-ended adventures in which you're free to tick off whatever bounties you've picked up as you please, or merely tinker with the scenery - just as eagerly as you might take on a new hunt. It's not quite open world Monster Hunter, but it certainly benefits from a new sense of purpose in its environments. This series has never been short of fantastic beasts and wondrous toys with which to slay them; now it's got playpens that are just as impressive to boot.Like Breath of the Wild, Monster Hunter World is a game that looks towards the west for inspiration, yet it's also one that western games could do well to learn from themselves. At a time when the likes of Bungie and EA are struggling to reward players for their investment in persistent online worlds, Capcom finds itself with something approaching the perfect formula. It's only getting on for over a decade old, but it's certainly never been any better than this. That's not to say it's without its eccentricities, or its faults. There are omissions that will prove controversial with returning players. For fresher players there are frustrations, such as the seemingly binary multiplayer scaling that makes it harder for smaller groups to overcome certain monsters than the solo hunter. There's the clunky menus, and the many systems acquired over the years of Monster Hunter's long history that clatter around clumsily together; there are the appendages and offshoots and dead-ends that can still, despite the best efforts of Capcom in Monster Hunter World, make it all seem infuriatingly arcane.Invest a little, though, and you'll get an awful lot back. The truth of Monster Hunter - and arguably its greatest strength - is that you're never truly its master, and that every player, be they novice or veteran, is always learning something new. Monster Hunter World sees 13 years of evolution come crashing together with some new influences to create a very exciting breed of beast. This has always been a superlative series; with the release of World, it's only become easier to see that's an undoubtable truth.

Find out more about our reviews policy.Parsing the difference between love and infatuation is a tricky business. There’s a potent cocktail of hormones and pheromones to contend with, intoxicating new emotions warring with old, cautionary memories. But sometimes there’s a transcendent moment when you just know it’s true love - a glance across a crowded dinner party, a lingering kiss, heavy with portent, or, in the case of my affair with Monster Hunter World, a massive chicken monster’s yellowed beak suckling raw egg out of a giant dinosaur shell. That may not sound like the height of passion, but it was the moment that pushed me from uncertain affection to full blown obsession with Capcom’s latest giant-monster-battling romp. You see, I spent a lot of my early time with Monster Hunter World as a sort of novice zoologist, stealthily stalking my prey and observing them in their natural habitat. It’s something the game enables (encourages, even) with its lush, dynamic, beautifully rendered environments. Gone are the segmented maps of Monster Hunter’s past, replaced by sprawling, seamless regions replete with prehistoric fantasy flora and fauna. This is a world that beckons you, invites you to get lost in it, and masterfully conceals its clockwork mechanisms under a thick layer of vibrant verisimilitude. Monster Hunter has always had an appealing, unique art style, but World pushes it to new levels, aided in part by the power of the current generation of consoles but also by its deft stylistic choices. Each area feels bespoke and fantastical, from the primordial Ancient Forest to the mysterious, enchanted Coral Highlands, to the gloomy, toxin shrouded unbelly of the Rotted Vale.And so I’m hypnotized by the ecology of the Ancient Forest, the first region World deposits you into after its table-setting intro. I’m hot on the trail of the scrawny, crested Kulu-Ya-Ku, down the winding paths of its desert habitat and into the lair of a native herbivore. In my previous attempts to track it, I’d discovered Kulu-Ya-Ku’s three-toed footprints and other signs of its passing — including shell fragments. It’s part of World’s new scoutflies mechanic, one of the many ways Capcom has tried (and largely succeeded) at making the latest entry more accessible to newcomers – although there's no shame in confusion, and our Monster Hunter World tips (opens in new tab) might prove a useful head start.

Scoutflies act as diegetic waypoints, and they become more useful and precise the more evidence of a monster’s movements you discover. Eventually, they’ll provide you with clear information about a monster’s location and the best route to them, obviating the old system where hunters would roam a region at random looking for their prey and then go through the onerous process of marking them with paintballs to follow their movement. Like a number of quality of life improvements that World introduces, scoutflies eliminate some of the irritation and busy work previously associated with the series’ hunts without dumbing down or oversimplifying the core elements that veterans cherish. Only after patiently tracking Kulu-Ya-Ku, however, do I get a real sense of how integrated the scoutfly mechanic is into the game’s ecologies. After the lanky beast purloins a fresh herbivore egg and is about to smack it open, it catches sight of me creeping around the periphery of the lair and startles. Every monster has different behaviors that dictate their routines and reactions, and many of them will attack a hunter on sight, but Kulu-Ya-Ku is more intent on escaping with its protein prize, so it scurries past me and back out into the scorching desert heat. When I hunt it down later, after a brief chase up some ledges (which can now be more quickly traversed thanks to the slinger, an arm mounted device that fires rocks and other ammunition but is also fitted with a grappling hook) and across a shattered ravine, I find it snoot-deep in that same precious egg, eagerly slurping up unborn dino. When its had its fill and moves on, the discarded egg lays where it falls, a new piece of a dynamic, living ecology and an element to discover and track with scoutflies. It’s World’s brilliant world-building distilled down into a powerful, singular (even romantic) moment. The creatures in World aren’t just static boss fights waiting for you to appear and trigger them. They move around the world, interacting with smaller insects and animals, battling one another for territory and domination, hunting for prey or sleeping. And the world changes and shifts to reflect their passage — a monster scratches its head and the feathers that flutter down become your research fodder, or claws at the ground to sharpen its claws, leaving gouges you can feed as data to your scoutflies. This in turn helps researchers back at your hub (which in World is a complex of old sailing vessels that have been cobbled together into a tiered, makeshift village) build a database of information about the monsters you track, which makes locating them in later encounters easier. Eventually, though, the love affair must end - it’s time to hunt. It’s here that Monster Hunter World will be most familiar to those who, like myself, have sunk hundreds or thousands of hours into previous Monster Hunter titles. While the combat feels a bit snappier and more reactive than other games in the series, particularly the ranged weapons, which make Monster Hunter feel closer to a proper third person shooter than ever before, it’s still very much the strategic, methodical combat that’s long been a hallmark of the franchise. I tuck and roll around Kulu-Ya-Ku’s vicious beak and flailing claw attacks, carefully searching for openings to pound it with my massive, stone-headed hammer, the occasional devastating strike shattering a critical part of its anatomy and sending precious crafting materials flying off. Targeting those vulnerable, breakable bits of your foes is made easier by the introduction of damage numbers, which change color depending on whether you’re striking a weak spot, and generally give you a much better indication of how effective your attacks are than in any previous iteration. 6 things I wish I knew before playing Monster Hunter World (opens in new tab)That central loop is very much still present, and as satisfying and deep as ever. Hunt monsters, slay or capture them for the components your smiths need to craft new and better weapons and armor, to hunt bigger and nastier beasts, to craft even more deadly implements and thicker protection. Wash, rinse, repeat. While there is a certain, repetitive groove that it's possible to fall into (and just as much grinding for rare materials as have been present in previous games), Monster Hunter World does an excellent job of breaking up the hunts with a smattering of important story moments, side activities, and clever diversions. And these diversions, as well as the critical story moments and the introduction of new mechanics or systems, are paced extremely well, another way that World strives to welcome newcomers to the complexities of the series without sacrificing depth.  If anything, in fact, there is more depth than ever before. Alongside the various items you craft from the materials you harvest in the world or from monsters (things like healing potions, food to increase your stamina, or traps to immobilize monsters), there are new specialized tools that add more gameplay options both during and outside of combat. Things like the ghillie suit that let you temporarily vanish while you sharpen your weapons or heal up, or the cleansing station that lets you purge yourself and your party of nasty status effects like bleeding and poison. Then there are the new environmental traps you can unleash mid-fight, to dump heavy boulders on an unsuspecting monster’s head or trap it in a net of vines while you wail away. Instead of the system in previous games, where you’d need to wear multiple pieces of the same armor set to unleash bonuses to things like attack or sharpening speed, now every piece of armor imparts some kind of added bonus, allowing hunters to mix and match in ways that were previously inadvisable. And there’s the aforementioned slinger, which means even melee hunters always have some kind of ranged attack available, with collectible ammo ranging from explosive and fiery to piercing and shattering. Monster Hunter World is an incredible achievement. It manages the nearly impossible feat of taking a franchise known (and in many corners beloved) for it’s incredible complexity and depth and making it significantly more approachable, without in any way stripping it down or diminishing it. It tells the most compelling, kinetic story in any Monster Hunter yet (not a tremendous feat, admittedly, but this is a worthy and interesting story) and offers some of the most interesting and addictive action combat in any franchise, bar none. If for some reason you know the core Monster Hunter gameplay doesn’t appeal to you, Monster Hunter World probably won’t change your mind.

Monster Hunter World,Suriel Vazquez,Game Informer,https://www.gameinformer.com/review/monster-hunter-world/a-fertile-new-ecosystem,"When it released in January, Monster Hunter: World ably served two masters. Many longtime fans thought the quality-of-life improvements and interactive ecosystems were breaths of fresh air, while newcomers wary of the series’ learning curve found a more approachable (though still dense) action-RPG. Five months later, the PC version of World serves a third master - PC players - remarkably well, provided you have a fairly powerful rig.The increased horsepower of a high-end computer allows World to run at an uncapped framerate at higher resolutions, which leads to an overall smoother experience – if your PC can handle it. While running around Astera and hunting down monsters looks wonderful, these nuanced ecosystems are demanding to render; running an Nvidia 1080 TI graphics card and an Intel Core i7 8700K CPU, I was just on the cusp of 60 frames for second at 1440p. Turning the resolution down to 1080p gave me about 20 additional fps, but after comparing the PC and console versions, the visual upgrade isn’t as drastic as some might have hoped for, especially when compared to the Xbox One X and PS4 Pro; up close, many textures look muddy and blurred.The optimized load times are an unquestionable godsend, however. On console, going on a hunt meant gearing up, gathering your party, and going to check your phone or use the bathroom while the environment loaded. On PC, load times are much briefer – usually less than 10 seconds.Exploring the rich locations for resources and monsters is a fantastic experience on mouse and keyboard; after some of the thrilling hunts I've had in the new world, I prefer slaying and skinning monsters with a PC-centric setup. The gamepad control scheme works well, but can occasionally feel clunky if you’re used to other action-oriented controls (Y and B for attacking, for instance). With a mouse and keyboard, a combination of more standard controls (using left and right mouse buttons to attack) and key-remapping feel much more comfortable. Being able to look around quickly with a mouse also makes keeping track of nimble enemies (like the Odogaron) much easier. This makes up for the jittery targeting system, which is ineffective in light of being able to simply keep track of monsters myself. I also appreciate being able to remap controls for melee and ranged weapons individually. After not taking to the default bow control scheme, I was able to rework it into something closely resembling a third-person shooter without sacrificing the setup I had going for my trusty great sword.One issue console players had with World was the size of the text and interface. That problem is still around for this port, and while the “large” text option added post-launch on consoles is available, World’s interface is dense and too small to properly read – at least when I was on the couch with a controller. When I was sitting at my desk and using my monitor, I had no problems scanning the minimap icons, inventory, control icons, and text.While combat is mostly improved, I wasn’t able to find a comfortable way to quickly select and use the exact item I wanted. A new PC-centric “radial” menu option (it’s actually a flat bar) lets you map items to the number keys, but only after pressing the F1 key, and this isn’t remappable. Considering the number keys aren’t used for anything else by default, mapping items to the number keys could have been the easiest way to use a potion then immediately use a whetstone to sharpen my weapon mid-fight. The controller-centric radial menu fares slightly better, but relies on one too many key presses to be consistent and doesn’t allow for diagonal inputs. I wound up using the scroll wheel to cycle through my items when looking for a healing potion or antidote in the heat of battle. This isn’t ideal either, as several of the special items clutter up this scrolling process when you’re looking for the one or two items you need. This isn’t a deal-breaker, but it fails to capitalize on one of the PC’s strongest advantages: quick access to multiple options.I spent a lot of my time poring over stats, items, and resources as I managed my flow of items and turned them into powerful armor. The PC version handles most of these tasks well, though the menus weren’t optimized for use on PC; moving items around between my pouch and item box still involves selecting items individually and a series of clicks and keyboard movements, and feels unintuitive with a mouse. The auto-sorting and restock options do a lot of heavy lifting, though, and while I still spent quite a bit of time in menus, it was mostly looking over my upgrade and item options instead of struggling with the interface.While Monster Hunter: World’s co-op setup is arcane at times, it works well on PC. Playing on pre-release servers, I was able to quickly hop into friends’ sessions and hunt with them, answer SOS, and receive some help of my own without issue. The in-game chat option is a bit choppy, but that’s not a big deal with so many third-party options to chat available.

A collection of minor issues don’t quite sour the experience, but still get in the way. You can’t skip cutscenes, and you cannot Alt+F4 at any point. Starting an offline session is an elaborate process, and reducing the resolution while in borderless windowed view produced a strange pixelated effect (which you can see below). Depending on your hardware, these issues may or may not surface.Monster Hunter: World’s PC version provides the same great hunting and gathering loops console players dove into earlier this year, and after having not played the series until now I’m absolutely hooked, both on the series and how the PC version enhances the experience. Adapting World's console control scheme to keyboard-and-mouse comes with some minor nitpicks, but I've found the tradeoffs are worth it. And once the DLC makes its way to this version, PC players who've waited months for one of the best games of the year should have another deep and rewarding action-RPG on their hands.

Monster Hunter World,Daniel Tack,Game Informer,http://www.gameinformer.com/games/monster_hunter_world/b/playstation4/archive/2018/01/25/majestic-monsters-and-where-to-find-them.aspx,"The latest game in the Monster Hunter franchise brings the core elements that have made the franchise a cult classic – difficult battles, fun and interesting progression, and stomping on dinosaurs with your friends – and opens the door for a deluge of new players with a more accessible sheen. Make no mistake, hearty challenges are still at the center of the experience, so veterans won’t be disappointed with the colossal end game leviathans. In addition to serving up what fans expect from the franchise, newcomers also have a chance to dip their toes in before being shoved out into the ocean and can enjoy a slightly more accessible ramp.Monster Hunter: World is the most accessible game in the series, and funnels new players into the core systems and mechanics over the first 20 hours of the game. The first low rank hours are comfortable and casual, followed by more challenging high rank fare and an expanded armor and weapons system, and then finally, Elder Dragons. End game hunts pull all your skills are put to the test, and hopefully after all the progressive challenges leading up to them you’re ready for some serious battles and top tier rewards. This clear segmentation works incredibly well, providing a linear path that slowly ramps up both enemy difficulty and the underlying options for your gear. By the time I hit credits after around 60, I was eager to get right back into the mix for more post-game fun. The intense task of bringing down an Elder Dragon and reaping the rewards provides a double-shot of dopamine to the brain, and you just want to roll back in and take on another.The progression loop is simple but enchanting. Go out, hunt monsters, use their parts to make new and exciting weapons and armor. As you progress through the game, more customization options unlock along with powerful set bonuses, allowing you to create a potent mix via set pieces and decorations (gem slotting for bonuses).An element of exploration adds to the experience, as you can stumble upon all-manner of interesting things out in the wild, from new Palico tribes and gadgets, creatures to collect and put in your house, and undiscovered monster clues that can lead on a dangerous, wild ride. While each area is its own instanced piece of the larger world, each feels distinct and interesting. Each time you come back to the main city of Astera, there’s something new to engage with as well, like sending out your Palico squads to hunt for you in previously conquered areas, upgrading your food options in the canteen, collecting the fruits of your harvest, or checking out the new goods that come into port via ship.
 
 The streamlining of certain franchise staples is a boon for both newcomers and veterans. Instead of dealing with annoying paintballs and guessing games during the hunt and chase, scout flies are a great solution. These helpful insects provide a tracking experience that feels natural and immersive as you collect tracks and other clues around an environment that lead to their habitats. Learning more about monsters from tracking, hunting, and capturing fills out your research library in the town hub, allowing you to get a comprehensive look at monster weak spots, elemental strengths, break-off parts, and drop tables. Studying these entries an extremely useful way to learn more about the monsters and your approach to beating them. Picking up useful materials as you run by instead of having to stop is great, and auto-crafting makes annoying activities like refilling your essential consumables a thing of the past.Monster Hunter: World offers 14 different weapon types that embrace all variety of play styles, from in-your-face aggression to long-range bombardment. Weapons are tagged with accessibility in mind, pushing new players toward more responsive equipment that may not require as much setup or methodical combat. But for those who want to show off and put their skills to the test there are plenty of opportunities. A longsword user will have a much different experience than say, the hunting horn, and experimenting with different weapons is a big part of the fun. Catching up a new weapon to your current “tier” only takes a few battles, so it’s easy to try out a new play style. This adds a good deal of longevity and entertainment to the overall experience.A few quirks drag World down from the heights of greatness. Some framerate issues happen from time to time, creating a jarring combat experience, especially when there is more than one giant monster on the screen at the same time. Sometimes when you have two or three big beasts in the same area, they won’t even really interact or move around unless you’re really close to the action – which is probably the last place you want to be in that situation. There are a few other minor down points, including one of the story-based battles (that the game has the ridiculous notion that you’d want the opportunity to play it more than once!) being an unfun slog that’s more of a trial of patience than a battle with a monster. When playing multiplayer, you must wait for a friend to complete story-based mission objectives before joining in their quests as well, but in the grand scheme of things these quibbles can be overlooked.Monster Hunter: World is the best game in the series, and a welcoming gateway for newcomers to get in on the tail-chopping, rodeo-riding, and titan-slaying. I never want to play the series on handheld again after this, as the grainy graphics and clawed clutch can’t compare to the redefined experience core platforms facilitate.

Monster Hunter World,Chelsea Stark,Polygon,https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/26/16934076/monster-hunter-world-review-ps4-xbox-pc-release,"Filed under:A Monster Hunter for everybodyTo answer the three most pressing questions around Monster Hunter: World: Yes, its creators have made a notoriously inaccessible franchise into something that, if not totally accessible, somewhat resembles it. Yes, it’s still filled with countless menus and tough-to-parse mythos. And yes, this game lets you be best friends with a cat. Does that mean you  should play Monster Hunter: World, even if you’ve never been able to hang with the franchise before? The game certainly remains a challenge, but one much easier to recommend to all types of players.The Monster Hunter franchise is known to rebuff new players. Liking Monster Hunter, in some player’s minds, is a special dedication, akin to liking cross-country skiing or watching the entire Cremaster Cycle in one weekend. You admire the folks that do it, but you also suspect they might be unrelenting masochists.  Monster Hunter: World guide and walkthroughIn this capacity, Monster Hunter: World, a game designed to be more inviting than its predecessors, is, for a lot of folks, the first modern incarnation of a franchise they’ve long been tantalized with but overwhelmed by. As someone from that group, I’m here to declare that Capcom has achieved its goal.Polygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences. When we award the Polygon Recommends badge, it’s because we believe the recipient is uniquely thought-provoking, entertaining, inventive, or fun — and worth fitting into your schedule. If you want curated lists of our favorite media, check out What to Play and What to Watch.Monster Hunter: World is not easy. It’s still layered with complex systems and still asks its players to invest time and knowledge. But World has sanded down the franchise’s most esoteric edges. You’ll spend more time wrestling with monsters than wrestling archaic control schemes. For all its complexity, the point of Monster Hunter is right there in the title: you hunt monsters. Your hunter, customized on a fairly robust character creator, starts the game journeying to a New World full of gorgeous, lush ecosystems teeming with creatures great and small (though usually just gigantic and angry). Your main foe is Zorah Magdaros, a magma-encrusted beast the size of a skyscraper, but getting an opportunity to slaughter it means tearing through a menagerie of monsters, each distinct and beautifully characterized, gradually accumulating the skill and gear necessary for an epic battle.The game’s story, hinged on Zorah’s movements, is a weak spot, a thin motivation to keep you moving forward. No matter. Monster Hunter is a game of moments, and there are plenty of stand-out characters to meet from the civilized sections of World’s hubs. Most of the truly memorable ones are cute-but-deadly cat Palicos, who help you along your way while also shouting a lot of cat-related puns. Monster Hunter: World shrewdly allows its fabulous beasts to take center stage, never letting story or cookie-cutter quest givers interfere with the promise of the game’s crux. Each monster, from the moment you first spot it across a clearing to the point you’ve turned its parts into spectacular armor, is distinct thanks to unique visual designs and many special ways each beast can kill you. I won’t forget the first time a Pukei-Pukei — a giant, green bird with a cartoonish face — vomited poison all over me, lolling its massive, pink tongue as a weapon. Or when the turtle-faced Radobaan rolled into me with its pokey armor of five-foot spikes, which I eventually shattered to nubs. The monsters have an uncanny style of movement that gives them life, while also communicating how you’re doing in a fight. Monsters will drool purple slime when you’ve poisoned them, or limp along when you’ve worn them down. The animations couple with a smart, unpredictable AI that won’t stop a monster from chasing you up a tree, running away as you wail on its back, or jumping in to a another monster’s battle, which would usually send me packing until they finished. This feature alone offers so much promise for battles branching in unexpected ways; I’m excited for the inevitable clips on YouTube. Just as the monsters are varied, so are the weapons used to demolish them. There are 14 different weapon classes in Monster Hunter: World, and each feels radically different, as if you’re changing your player class every time you pick a new one. I grabbed the hammer, which I learned from my pre-review was particularly satisfying to use when I built up a charge, ran into battle and unleashed a tornado of swings on the monster’s head and front legs; I also enjoy the insect glaive, a long blade that sews together flowing combos, including one where you can vault over the monster and smoothly transition into an air dash. It’s tempting to master each ranged and melee weapon, though some have high ceilings of difficulty, like the combo-focused charge blade, which transitions from sword and shield to axe, allowing you to unleash stored-up energy. The game does a better job than previous entries of explaining weapons’ basic functions and showing players easy combos, but I still occasionally wanted to hit up YouTube for a tutorial on how to master more complex moves. Of course, seeing how well another hunter handles a weapon is a good lesson too, and one of many advantages to playing the game with a fully stacked party of four. Nearly every quest in Monster Hunter: World works with one to four players. Co-operative multiplayer isn’t flawless. For example, if I have to watch a cutscene on a main story quest, every other player is forced to wait to join the quest until after I’m done. But overall, the transition between multiplayer quests is seamless, meaning players can run through a series of quests and strategize and plan on voice chat in between. This is clutch, since more players open up the game for more sneaky ways of capturing or killing the monster with traps or bombs that are harder to execute on your own.If you feel totally overwhelmed during a mission, World adds an SOS flare, which calls other players into battle. It brings immediate aid, as responding players should join you right away, but I wasn’t able to test it during the review period due to low server populations. There’s also your ever-ready in-game sidekick, your Palico. Not only is this cute cat extremely customizable at the start of the game (get ready to lose 30 minutes customizing a cat friend!), you’ll also craft them armor and weapons that can be tailored to each monster’s weaknesses. Yes, there is an element of playing dress-up with a cute cat, but my Palico Vegas (named for my own cat, of course) pulled me out of plenty of jams, and in my opinion, deserved to look nice while doing it.The streamlined additions to multiplayer are just one of the massive quality-of-life improvements evident in Monster Hunter: World. Many of the other tweaks are evident when I began to tackle all the things needed to maintain and strengthen my hunter. Crafting is a huge element in the game, as you’ll gather plants, mushrooms, berries and more to create healing items, ammunition and traps. Gathering used to be arduous, as you’d have to wait for an animation to play out every time you wanted to pick the dang herb used in the game’s most basic healing potions. Now you can quickly grab ingredients as you explore, and you can even set the most important necessities to automatically craft once you’ve picked up the required ingredients, meaning less time in menus when you’re on a quest. When you’ve returned and need to do more serious crafting, recipes with pyramids of required sub-ingredients will let you just craft those without leaving that screen. The other key loop in the game lies in all the armor you can craft, and the massive trees of weapon upgrades available. Most armor comes from harvesting parts from monsters, with some extra bits of ore or bone thrown in for good measure. Each set of armor comes with strengths to different types of elements, but what will surely sway many players between one piece and the next is the look; there are certain sets I still covet. Since there is no feasible way to get a full five-piece set from killing a monster one time, it takes multiple kills to collect all the scales, membranes, quills and pelts required. This could be where World begins to feel like a chore, but instead of making players randomly grind for loot, you’re presented with a plan. A coveted piece of armor’s pieces can be added to your wishlist, and researching your monster quarry, by examining its tracks and other leavings while in the field, unlock information about how you can get the exact piece you need. Want Pukei-Pukei’s quills to create a poison weapon? Your monster research shows you can get them by focusing attacks on that monster’s head.It’s all these elements — the unpredictability of monster hunts, the variety and challenge of weapons, the fact you can spend more time hunting and less time crafting — that will appeal to so many types of new players. I knew after I had spent 30 minutes hunting for mining spots in the Coral Highlands, a world that feels like someone drained all the ocean water from the world’s most vibrant aquarium, that I was hooked, especially because those ore chunks would allow me to build an ice-resistant armor needed to tackle my next big game. Monster Hunter: World scratches the itch for complexity, both in hunt for rare gear and skill with its weapons, but this time it’s a game that no one should be intimidated to get into. Monster Hunter: World is still complex. It still won’t hold your hand through parts and may require a few friends for optimal enjoyment. It isn’t for everybody, but if you give it a little time and work, it’s a world worth visiting.

   on August 7, 2018 at 3:30PM PDTWhile some fans of the series were disappointed when Monster Hunter XX came to the Switch as a Japan-only exclusive, the good news is that we don't have to suffer in region-imposed torture any longer. The latest big fish in the franchise's pond, Monster Hunter World, is finally here, and it blows the previous western releases out of the water.For seasoned players, the gameplay loop in Monster Hunter World is immediately recognisable. Your job is a cycle that involves crafting weapons, bulking up, killing monsters, and looting them for materials. However, a well-crafted narrative has not traditionally been a part of that gameplay loop, and that may have been a deterrent for those looking for a foothold into the franchise in the past. Luckily for them, the first major point of difference here from the previous mainline titles is the way that the plot and gameplay are grafted together. A spinoff, Monster Hunter Stories, stepped off the beaten track by introducing a simple yet satisfying narrative, and now Monster Hunter World solidifies that step by using the building blocks of previous narrative concepts to deliver a well-paced experience that spends more time focusing on the bigger picture.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Monster Hunter World Video ReviewWhile you spend a lot of time chasing an Elder Dragon that wouldn't look out of place in the movie Pacific Rim, Monster Hunter World's choice to integrate Guild and Village quests into one coherent story cuts out any confusion or ambiguity that new players may feel when it comes to figuring out which quests progress your journey. The fact that everything is tuned for a rewarding solo experience is a plus--it's entirely possible to pump through 60 hours of quests without ever interacting with another player online. And when combined with more intelligent monster AI, facing off against a fire-breathing Tyrannosaurus-like creature on your own makes the stakes feel even higher.On top of the story, which revolves around the mystery of why the aforementioned Elder Dragon has appeared in the game's new region, there have been some quality-of-life changes that ease your transition into the world of monster hunting. Instead of frontloading a lot of text-based tutorials as in previous titles, you now have a Handler who doles out helpful information to you as you progress through zones of increasing complexity. It can feel a bit like having an annoying younger sibling tagging along on otherwise deadly adventures, but her vocal cues and vast knowledge about monster types are helpful when encountering new enemies for the first time. This assistance ceases when you start cutting your teeth on High Rank monsters, but hearing about new skills and immediately putting them into practice in the field is an excellent way to learn about the game from the ground up.Monster Hunter World feels like an open-world game to some extent, with fantastically large maps of a scale that we haven't seen before (both vertically and horizontally), no discernable game-pausing loading screens between zones in hunting areas, and a wealth of beautifully rendered environments to slaughter colossal monsters in. A helpful addition to this new world is the swarm of scoutflies that serve as a way to track monsters and other objectives.Navigating the vastness of those areas without scoutflies would have been incredibly tedious. Once you've located a few traces of a monster's path in a zone, your scoutflies automatically track it to its current location. Gather up enough clues over time and soon your insectoid minions will be able to predict where a certain monster is located based on past movements. This is very useful for investigation missions with tight time frames at higher ranks and sticks to your canon characterisation: a seasoned hunter who understands their prey. Except, perhaps, when said prey glitches through two stories' worth of foliage and can't be attacked with any weapons that you've got on hand. Fortunately, those instances are few and far between.Part of the ability to capitalise on a monster's weakness is the smart use of all the tools in your hunting arsenal, with the most important being your weapon of choice. The Hunter Arts from Monster Hunter Generations have been removed, and the game's focus is solely on your ability to dish out ridiculous amounts of damage using your respective weapon's combo. Light weapons are still the most mobile while the technical weapons are still the most difficult to understand and master, but there are ample opportunities to get experience with whichever blade, bow, or lance you've decided on. Weapon upgrade trees are all viewable at a glance, and the ability to make a wishlist of parts for your next upgrade makes the process more convenient, and helps you decide which expeditions to focus on.Bowguns in particular have received the most notable facelift: it appears that there has been an effort to mimic the kind of playstyle you'd have in a third-person shooter, and this is most apparent when you're firing from the hip with the light bowgun. That doesn't necessarily change the strategy needed; you'll still have to make effective use of environmental hazards, traps, barrel bombs, and dung in order to chase down your quarry. There are now more ways to get a leg up on monsters, which make combat encounters more accessible to different playstyles. Elemental effects are all the rage once more, with weapons boasting essential new perks that have evolved alongside the enemies that you forge them from, and the benefits of bringing water to a firefight is a lesson you'll learn early.Of particular necessity is the ability to mount monsters through aerial combos, or through the slightly less coordinated mad scramble off a cliff onto a creature's back; you're given the opportunity to knock a monster down, which will buy you time to slice off a tail or a claw. While the game will reward you no matter what strategies you take, knowing a monster's weak points is still a must if you strive to upgrade your gear. It's best to nail down your favourite weapon in the Arena--a mode where you test your mettle with specific gear against a monster that you've fought before.Multiplayer integration is, for the most part, seamless. As mentioned above, there's no distinction between Village and Guild quests anymore, so missions can be done alone or with a friend, and you'll both only have to do it once to complete it. You can start a quest alone in an online session and wait for more hunters to pop in to assist. Alternatively, you can seek out an online session for people of a certain hunter rank, and just go along for the ride if they need a hand with anything. The only qualifier is that some story-focused missions require the leader to either watch a cutscene or discover a monster before others can join.You can be in the same online session as someone else without having to do the quests that they're doing, which is useful for those who might want to keep an eye on a friend who's new to the franchise. Players who are struggling solo can also send out an SOS flare that lets their friends put together a little rescue party to save the day. In the downtime between adventures, you can do anything from arm wrestling to challenging each other's times on the killing leaderboards.Getting together with your mates takes a couple of extra steps compared to loading into a multiplayer session on the fly with a stranger. To play with friends alone, you’ll have to join in on their fun via the friends list on the console dashboard, or by sharing a 12-digit session ID. In a game that’s all about momentum and sprinting off into the horizon at the next challenge, getting your hunting posse together is manageable but slightly tedious. That being said, a few minutes to specifically set up a multiplayer session doesn’t necessarily make or break the game.As expected, Monster Hunter World scales the difficulty up if you're not the only one embarking on the quest. Up to four people can go out into the wilderness at once, and the beta experience has already demonstrated to many how exhilarating group combat can be. The more targets available for monsters, the more unpredictable their movements. This means that while you may have more firepower, it can be harder to lock down a monster that's particularly prone to relentless charging or rapid aggression. Luckily, playing with others gives you the opportunity to try out different weapon compositions, and while unusual weapons like the hunting horn might see minimal use in the solo campaign, its sweet, party-buffing tunes and your teamwork abilities will become crucial to helping your friends take down the most savage of beasts.While it may seem like quite a bit has changed, there's a hell of a lot in Monster Hunter World that's stayed the same. Whether it's the appearance of draconic series regulars like the Rathalos and the Rathian or the presence of tried and true weapons, the roots of the Monster Hunter franchise are strong with its latest release. Apart from the overall sprucing up of graphics and the cutscenes with full voice-over, the standout improvements really come from the simplification of the existing systems in a way that welcomes newcomers without alienating existing fans. A lack of loading screens makes exploration a pleasure, and tracking new and improved monsters through areas as they rank up means that you've got plenty to conquer once the story quests are complete. There may not be any new weapons, and there may be a Hunter Arts-sized hole left in the hearts of players who spent hours getting good at the various Styles. However, the removal of those old mechanics feels less like a funeral and more like a necessary streamlining.The PC version of Monster Hunter World, on a superficial level, doesn't exhibit any critical differences in performance compared to the console versions of the game. While running on the highest display settings, we noticed a marked amount of pop-in during some of the more graphically intensive cutscenes, but it wasn’t enough to be off-putting. Some trees in the distance take a little longer to come to life, but you’re often too preoccupied with killing a slavering, townhouse-sized animal to care. The Hunters themselves also generally appear to have warmer, more realistic flesh tones on the PC, but the overall difference in aesthetic mileage is otherwise minimal.One area where the contrast is stark, however, is in multiplayer accessibility. While the PlayStation 4 version had its hiccups with getting the squad together, those aren’t present at all in the PC version, which makes the most of its integration with Steam to get you playing together in under a couple of minutes. It's refreshingly simple compared to laboriously typing out a string of numbers, or fiddling with the PlayStation 4’s subpar native interface.Another pleasant difference which you’ll notice while preparing for multiplayer missions is the fact that there’s almost no downtime at all. This might vary based on your network and PC, but in our experience the time between posting a quest and having it ready to go when others join was instant. In comparison, the PlayStation 4 version seems to take its own sweet time when preparing quests within both individual and multiplayer sessions. Like the aesthetic differences between platforms, this is relatively minimal in the grand scheme of things. However, an improvement is still an improvement, and the overall quality of life differences in regards to multiplayer on PC are definitely welcome.In terms of how the game handles mechanically on PC, the answer is positive. While PC ports of console games have the potential pitfalls of unwieldy control schemes and unintuitive keyboard shortcuts, Monster Hunter World has gracefully avoided these. The default keyboard and mouse combination works well, even when stress-tested under combat situations that require plenty of frantic directional and dodge-rolling inputs. Using the mouse to control both attack inputs as well as overall steering took us the length of the tutorial to get used to, but it never presented an issue in itself. There’s no need to play Twister with your fingers to execute deadly combos here, though fans of the controller input will likely gravitate to the same for efficiency at the end of the day.Ever since the title was first announced, it was clear that Capcom was gunning for something grander than Monster Hunter Generations. It has succeeded, and this is likely the biggest and best that the franchise has ever been. It's not just the comparative depth of the narrative; it also boasts almost seamless integration between combat systems that were previously incomprehensible for amateurs. The Monster Hunter formula has definitely honed its claws, and all the above factors play their part in making Monster Hunter World a meaningful evolution for the series at large.Monster Hunter World is featured on our list of the best Xbox co-op games.Editor's note: This review has been updated to include our experience with the PC version of Monster Hunter World -- August 7, 2018Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"
Monster Hunter World,Keza MacDonald,Kotaku,https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-world-the-kotaku-review-1822557729,"Video games often deal in illusions, proffering the fantasy of control and power even when your meaningful influence is minimal. Monster Hunter: World, the new third-person action game from Capcom, absolutely deals in fantasy. It plucks you from reality and sets you in the domains of exotically imposing monsters that you must hunt. In this game, however, the sense of accomplishment and pride that comes from felling them is anything but an illusion.This review originally ran on 1/30/2018. We’re bumping it up because the game is out on PC today. Check here for more on how the PC version performs. In every Monster Hunter game, you work for your successes, learning about your quarry, tracking it, studying its movements and attacks until you’re finally able to get the better of it. The dragon might have size and power, but you’ve got brains, nerve, and some potions that you crafted from herbs and mushrooms. These games are as much about the thrill of being hunted as about the hunt. Their battles only work because you know these beasts could eat you for lunch.I’ve been waiting for a decade for Monster Hunter to finally become popular outside of Japan, ever since a flu-ridden weekend a decade ago at University where my only company was Monster Hunter Freedom Unite on the PSP. There have always been barriers to entry: a bad camera, boring mushroom-gathering early quests, flummoxing controls that required you to physically contort your hand, nonexistent tutorializing, baffling menus, and portable-console graphics. Each new installment in this series has brought incremental improvements to the franchise’s flaws, but they were all fundamentally built on an engine that looked and felt like it had barely changed since the very first PlayStation 2 game from 2004. Monster Hunter: World is the first true, significant overhaul of the series. Little has really changed about the set-piece battles that have always been Monster Hunter’s main attraction, but by god, everything that surrounds them is a lot better.There are no new weapons here, and none of the fan-pleasing combat flourishes that 2016’s Monster Hunter Generations introduced, though there are plenty of new monsters. (Only a small sprinkling of series favorites like dragon-duo Rathian and Rathalos make an appearance in the main storyline.) It’s just you, your chosen weapon, big beasts and their flourishing habitats. And what habitats they are. Especially on a Xbox One X or PS4 Pro, Monster Hunter: World looks amazing. The enhanced versions allow you to prioritize either resolution for 4K displays or framerate for super-smooth combat, but even without these enhancements you can see the slaver falling from the jaws of an exhausted Rathian, and admire the motes of dust sparkling in sunlight in the Ancient Forest. The Coral Highlands—a pastel-colored marvel of an environment with otherworldly tendrils of pink and purple plant life enveloping mountains of coral—opens up about halfway through the story, and it is jaw-droppingly beautiful. My mouth was open the first time I saw it.""Not suitable for vegetarians""Hunter-Gathering SimulatorSumptuous habitats packed with life, intimidating beasts to kill, excellent fashion senseSome online-play features are fiddly and need improvingCapcomPlaystation 4, Xbox One, PCJanuary 26 (Consoles), August 9 (PC)Finished the story, took on some high-rank quests, spent a very enjoyable weekend on live servers, crafted nine different hats, logged 31 hours, 29 minutesFor years I have been describing epic battles to friends who don’t play Monster Hunter, when what they have actually seen is a muddy-looking little dude facing off against a dragon that doesn’t fit on a tiny screen. Now, finally, it looks as awesome as it feels to play.There is still an awful lot to learn. Really getting into the nuts and bolts of Monster Hunter—the minutiae of gathering, tracking, bounties and research, investigations, monster carves, weapon techniques—would fill thousands of words. Little of it is well-explained as you play, though written tutorials and a handler character who pipes up with useful hints when you’re actually out in the field make a spirited attempt at helping with the basics. You will still have questions that can only be answered by Google or a more knowledgeable friend. The Monster Hunter community, thankfully, is generous with its ample knowledge, but it is still ridiculous to have to consult wikis or guides to learn what the hell your weapon stats actually mean.Here’s the thing, though: this isn’t actually as big of a problem as it first seems. Monster Hunter: World explains the basics fairly well, and all the rest of the knowledge gradually accumulates from playing, talking to other players, exploring, and hunting. You can easily get through the whole story without knowing a thing about skill charms or weapon affinity. Meanwhile, you discover where to find useful plants and bugs and ores by spending time out in the wilds, gradually filling up a map with icons that tell you what’s out there. The more time you invest, the more knowledge you will glean. After 30 hours there is a lot I still don’t know. I’ve still barely found any of the many camp sites hidden in the four giant environments.The challenge with previous Monster Hunter games has always been getting to the point where you want to learn more. This is where World is most significantly improved. The older games were slow starters. World, however, wastes no time in throwing you into fights against impressive creatures, and it looks so beautiful and controls so well that it’s easier to get invested. A quick quest turns into two. Responding to an SOS flare gives you a quest reward that opens up a new set of armour. You spend another hour or so seeking out that elusive last material to forge a new Charge Blade. Then you want to try it out in another fight. It is eminently bingeable.The things that have been simplified are things that were needlessly time-consuming in the first place. New Monster Hunter: World players will never know the pain of hand-crafting 10 pickaxes from bones and rocks, then having all of them break during a single 20-minute mining quest. They will not know the meditative pause whilst waiting patiently for seconds-long animations to play out every time they gather a herb. I don’t miss that nonsense one bit. What hasn’t changed is hunting monsters with beautifully balanced weaponry, and that was always the point.The secret of Monster Hunter’s combat is that even when you don’t really know what you’re doing, you don’t feel like a clown. The most inexperienced hunter could still land a couple of hits with a big weapon like a greatsword, even if it takes 45 minutes to fell a monster. Better players can do things more efficiently. The game rewards skill and witnessing a top player at work in a Monster Hunter will likely motivate you to improve. When you see an expert player at work with a glaive or dual swords, dodging away from the tail of a dragon a fraction of a second before it sweeps them off their feet, then retaliating with a five-hit combo... it looks positively choreographed.I’m accomplished with Gunlance and Switch Axe: respectively, a massive lance that delivers shotgun blasts from its tip, and a transforming axe that becomes a sword and can also discharge a close-up explosion with its most complicated combo. For this new game, I decided to learn some new weapons. As the hours went by and I familiarized myself with nimble Glaive and heavy-hitting Hammer, I noticed how my scrappy little opportunistic combos became flowing sequences of strikes, timed perfectly to fit into the gaps between bad-tempered dinosaurs’ attacks. I started to feel like such a badass, leaping onto a fire-breathing T-Rex’s head and blasting it with the axe, my teammates muttering “niiiiiice!” into their headsets. As your skills, weapons and armor improve, you can slaughter monsters that used to terrify you in ten minutes. It’s such a satisfying progression.Enumerating Monster Hunter: World’s features doesn’t tell you much about why it’s so easy to love. It is at once silly and stylish, comedic without being self-conscious about it. At the canteen in the game’s hub, a one-eyed cat-chef serves up a sizzling platter of meats with piratical swagger, theatrically placing the final garnish atop a fresh-caught fish. A little pig follows you around whilst you stock up on provisions and bounties, and a tutorial prompt mysteriously promises that “something good” might happen if you scoop him up and carry him around like a baby. Other players’ customisable Guild Cards show them reclining mock-sexily in extravagantly ridiculous armour, their feline companion imitating the pose. As with previous Monster Hunter games, you can hunt monsters with up to three other players. If you hunt solo, you’re accompanied by a cat-pal who is a constant source of amusement, bravely thwacking at a wyvern’s legs with a weapon shaped like a ukulele, meowing away, occasionally appearing mounted on the back of a smaller dinosaur or in a little inflatable dinghy.The ludicrous armor sets are a strong reason to play Monster Hunter: World. “I look like a shit Groot cosplayer,” said a friend of mine in dismay upon finally completing his Barroth set. I spent half the early game in a pair of stupid sunglass-goggles, which amused me so much that I kept upgrading them instead of forging new, more powerful armor. One of my favorite monsters, the floaty, fluffy Paolumu, yields a faux-fur outfit so tempting that I immediately wanted to fight it again so that I could craft a puffy hat for my cat-pal.New players will find the game’s main story mode a healthy challenge. For players who’ve made it through a few Monster Hunter games before, it’s unlikely that the story quests will kick your arse. There were only two that had me exhaling slowly whilst looking at the “Quest Failed” screen, and yelling in triumph when I landed the final blow. The story itself is pretty nothingy; the cutscenes are stylish but the plot lacks substance, and the more cinematic climactic mission was a total let-down compared to the freeform, tense one-on-one expeditions that led up to it. Once that final cutscene plays, you come to realize that the entirety of the story is really a warm-up for High Rank quests, where all the hardest monsters are lurking alongside powered-up versions of the beasts you despatched before. I’m in no hurry to rush through them.Already, World has welcomed millions of people into the fold, and with extensive planned support from Capcom, it’s a game that could go all year. (Update 8/09/2018: Seven months later, Capcom has indeed supported the game. Read through our extensive coverage of the new events, monsters, and other additions.) There are problems with the online functionality that Capcom would do well to fix in patches: matchmaking and questing ad-hoc with random players is easy, but if you want to hunt a specific monster it’s annoying to dive through menus to search for exactly the quests you want. If you want to invite players to your squad to play regularly, you have to both be online and in the same session at the same time, which requires a lot of coordination outside of the game. Xbox One players have reported frequent disconnects, though this is something I haven’t experienced at all on the PS4. (A Capcom rep has indicated that the company is looking into the Xbox issues regarding matchmaking.)Monster Hunter isn’t all that much better than it’s always been. It’s just so much easier to appreciate now. What once felt like a well-kept secret amongst players with enough time and energy to scale the barriers to entry is now easier for everyone else to enjoy, thanks to a top-to-bottom overhaul that has made Monster Hunter: World the most beautiful and exciting game in the series. The depth remains, but many of the fiddly irritations that have been holding this series back have been swept away. As a long-time Monster Hunter player, it’s a wonderful thing to witness."
Monster Hunter World,Bob Mackey,USgamer,http://www.usgamer.net/articles/monster-hunter-world-review,"Monster Hunter's return to consoles is a confident, barnstorming series best.In many ways the Monster Hunter series was ahead of its time. Though the fairly similar Phantasy Star Online predates it, Monster Hunter's 4-player co-operative action RPG design and the treadmill of hunting for drops to get better gear has a whiff of that which has recently made Destiny so compelling about it. That makes now the absolutely perfect time for Monster Hunter World, the series' big-budget return to platforms that can properly support this design with a near-constant internet connection.The result is exactly what you'd expect: the same exciting-yet-methodical monster-smashing combat atop a game that is now wired up in a manner that's designed to keep its already satisfying loop of combat, upgrade and preparation even more fresh. This is a game where login bonuses, limited time events and drop-in, drop-out multiplayer sit happily alongside the same old hardcore beast-hunting action, now also bolstered by a narrative that's delivered in a fashion more befitting of a high-profile console game. 
 
This rebuilt vision of Monster Hunter feels like a truly smart, forward-thinking improvement to the series. It's an impressive leap forwards.If you're a fan of Monster Hunter's previous outings this might initially be a little shocking. When the game gets going and within five minutes you're clambering atop a beast the size of a small town it all feels a little alien. This isn't for those people, of course, since while they might appreciate it this exists mainly to draw in fans of the more bombastic, story-driven role playing games that are far more common on console. Very quickly, however, World reasserts its true identity. It is still Monster Hunter as all hell.Monster Hunter is stripped back to its very core here - and when rebuilt, it has been done so without many of the foibles and series conventions that made it difficult to approach. Beefier hardware allows for areas to now be one seamless zone, which in turn led designers to make healing a more simplistic affair. Hardcore fans bemoaned that you can now heal while moving, but this is a compromise, since the series' typically unforgiving nature is instead present in how the health bar gradually refills as you drink your potion. If you're hit midway through a drinking animation, the potion is consumed but the bar stops filling, part of your precious restorative wasted.Little touches like this run through Monster Hunter World as its very foundation, and this rebuilt vision of Monster Hunter feels like a truly smart, forward-thinking improvement to the series. It's an impressive leap forwards. Much of what made it great is still there, such as the fourteen different classes of weapon each with their own unique abilities and often quite considered method of combat. If you want to dive in learning outrageous combos you can, but combat is also made approachable with more simple weapon options that'll instead let less confident players focus on the other major star of this entry, the world itself. 
 
Depending on who you ask at Capcom, the World suffix of this game's title has a few different meanings. For one it's a series first worldwide release. That release also reflects a wider development philosophy - to make a game that might have broader appeal outside Japan, something previous entries have struggled to do. I like to think the real reason is the world itself, however - that's the star of the show, with each area of the game as alive as the beasts that roam it.Each of Monster Hunter World's zones is teeming with detail, from the five main hunting areas through to the endearing, pleasant hub area of Astera. When you're out hunting the world is your greatest ally, filled with loot that can be crafted into helpful items and even helpful creatures and environmental hazards that can be used to trap your targets. If you're really stuck one of the most thrilling things to do is to turn nature against itself by luring large boss monsters into each other's paths to cause a ferocious battle. While Monster Hunter World looks lovely visually, this is where the extra horsepower of the consoles seems to truly go - into artificial intelligence and interesting systems that interlock and interact in ways that have even left the developers surprised. Sometimes the little touches of that world are what surprise the most - the things you can barely notice. There's some sublime audio work going on in the background, and hardcore fans who want to turn off damage numbers and other display elements will find plenty of visual and aural clues as to how they're doing in battle. Speaking of combat - streamlined though many areas of World are, the series' methodical, carefully-paced but energetic combat remains, placing a constant emphasis on learning the behaviors of enemies so you can time your attacks and position yourself accordingly. When things go well, it feels sublime. A highlight are the blunt force weapons - the sense of weight and impact when they hit home really is something to behold. 
 
The manner in which Capcom has balanced out the needs of their existing hardcore fans and newcomers is admirable and impressive. There's no messing about at the onset - after some typically chipper story exposition, you're thrown into things. Here are the three or four places you need to know about in the hub area - off you go to hunt. There's few intrusive tutorial screens, so if you know what you're doing or are just feeling confident the on-ramp to get into the actual game is remarkably short. Crucially, however, if you want help it's never far away and has never been better.If you know what you're doing or are just feeling confident the on-ramp to get into the actual game is remarkably short. Crucially, however, if you want help it's never far away and has never been better.You can now try out weapons and practice with them in a new training area, and it's easier than ever to earmark things you want to craft, see what ingredients you need for new gear or upgrades and see what you're going to look like once you equip it. Out in the field your Scoutflies act as a sensible compromise for gathering and tracking, taking on the form of green aura that highlights items you can interact with and once you've found enough clues out in the environment will begin to lay out a Fable 2 style glistening breadcrumb trail that'll lead you right to your target.There's a decent selection of old and new monsters on offer to hunt and capture, and though this isn't the largest cast of beasts in the series Monster Hunter World makes up for that with its sheer sense of scale and ambition. It feels like there's more variety to anything you might attempt at any given time, and the newly beefed-up story is a decent-quality narrative that's characterful enough to entertain but not so heavy-handed that it distracts or detracts from what the series is really about, which is that core loop and the systems that make it work so brilliantly. 
 
Strangely enough, one of the few flaws in Monster Hunter World relates to one of the areas with the most exciting potential - online play. The game facilitates drop-in, drop-out play, but it's not quite that simple, with a system in place where players must have experienced all the cutscenes in a mission on their own before they can join another player or have any other players join them on that same mission. This means either soloing the mission first time out or heading in, seeing cutscenes, backing out and then going in with your party - it feels pretty clumsy.This is a one-time issue for the main story assignment missions, however, and the other online features such as the SOS flare work fine once you've pushed past this little wrinkle. Monster Hunter World is really designed to be played with others once you get to the higher-rank, high-ticket items - while you can solo much of the game, the heart of the game is in tackling its co-operative content as a well-oiled team. This entry keeps that intact, and even with a few bumps in the road online is far easier than the hoops one had to jump through on handheld machines. The truth is, Monster Hunter has always been brilliant - but it's always been niche. Monster Hunter World feels like the right game to finally crack that - a game that makes smart changes that might finally mean that a wider audience will at last fully understand, experience and enjoy that brilliance. It's not without a few minor flaws, but it's an excellent, satisfying game - and an incredibly easy recommendation to all, not just hardcore fans.Version tested: PS4, on a PS4 Pro.

Jason Faulkner 
Monster Hunter has always been one of those franchises that have really stood on the precipice of becoming a hit in the West. While the series has performed well in its native Japan since its inception, certain aspects have prevented it from being a smash in other territories. That trend started to change with the last few entries on the Nintendo 3DS selling over a million copies apiece in the United States, but it wasn’t until this latest release that the series is finally in a form that makes it approachable for a broader range of gamers.Monster Hunter World is the first main game in the series since Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate was released in 2012 to release on a console. As much as I love the Nintendo 3DS, it’s plain to see that the franchise needed to move to a more technically capable platform to flourish, and Monster Hunter World uses the increased horsepower of the PS4 and Xbox One to craft a much more intriguing and engrossing world than what we’ve seen previously.Practically every system of the game has been upgraded over the last 3DS entry (Monster Hunter Generations), and it’s just so much more appealing to play. The New World, to which your hunter is called to explore and tame, is gorgeous, and each animal, from the lowly insects to the gigantic Elder Dragons, have their own unique look and animations that fill the game with character.The most prominent improvement in my eyes though is the loading. In the Nintendo 3DS Monster Hunter entries, you had to load between each area of a region, which didn’t lend itself to major hunts across a lot of territories. In Monster Hunter World though, you can bet you’ll cover a ton of ground tracking and fighting each of your targets.It’s the hunts that take center stage in this game, and all aspects of Monster Hunter World exist to serve this purpose. As you progress through the plot, each large monster you encounter more or less keeps parity with you, so each new species you battle makes for an exciting foe. The plot itself is, well, it’s there. You don’t have to worry about it much, and it mainly serves as a catalyst to propel you into the new world and give you a reason to hunt new monsters.This game does something I’ve rarely seen before in that you spend so much time on a hunt that you start to feel like you know a monster. Considering it can take 30-40 minutes just to down one foe, you begin to think of them as living creatures who are part of their habitat instead of just some AI enemy for you to cut down.Sometimes I felt sorry for monsters as I took them down, like the ridiculous Kulu-Ya-Ku, a strange bird/dinosaur creature that is the Jar-Jar Binks of the game. At other times, by the time the fight was almost won I savagely hated these infernal beasts. For example, the damn Tobi-Kadachi with its quick movements and lightning attacks had me cursing it until I finally took it out.The basic gameplay loop consists of hunting down a large monster so you can use its body parts as material to make weapons and armor to hunt down more powerful monsters. (Almost) every large monster has its own armor set, and each upgrade of your weapons takes parts from more and more powerful monsters.This isn’t a game you can ignore your equipment in because all of your stats are derived from it. You can’t power level and hope to beat the game with Iron-level weapons because your character doesn’t have a level. Instead, you’re forced to scour the New World for fauna and flora that will enable you to discover and build increasingly powerful weapons.The item gathering aspect is probably the part of Monster Hunter World that will turn some prospective players off the most. Some items you’ll be able to gather in the same spot over and over, while some are only obtainable by carving them from dead or captured monsters, or in bonus items from a hunt. Luckily you can gain a record of what items are available from each monster by researching them. In Monster Hunter World, each creature leaves its mark on the environment.So, if you’re hunting a Great Jagras, a gigantic lizard, you’ll find footprints and scratchings throughout the area its traveled. By examining these, you gain research points (and find the location of the creature). The more research points you accrue, the more bonuses you earn concerning a monster and one of those includes an entry in a guidebook telling you what items the beast contains. Fortunately, by “breaking” the body parts of creatures by attacking them repeatedly, you can increase the chance of specific items dropping. However, I can’t say there haven’t been times that I spent 30 minutes or more hunting a monster for an item I needed to craft my next weapon or armor only to have it not appear, which can be incredibly frustrating.Since combat is such a large part of the game, it’s a good thing that it’s incredibly satisfying. There are 14 different weapons types in Monster Hunter World, and each has its own way of handling that makes it unique. You can’t just pick a weapon at random and start hacking-and-slashing your way through whatever moves. Each type of arm has its own unique abilities and combos that give the game a Dark Souls feel as opposed to handling like Devil May Cry or a more fast-paced game. You have to be deliberate in your attacks and know the strengths and weaknesses of your weapon of choice to hunt successfully in this game.As you play, you’ll likely try all of the weapons once, and you should. Each player is going to find a core group of weapons they’re happy with and stick with them. With the resources and time sink crafting or upgrading weapons takes it’s only feasible to equip yourself with two or three types anyway. During my playthrough, I stuck with Long Swords (katanas that typically look a lot like Sephiroth’s Masamune) and Insect Glaives.Long Swords pack a punch but allow you to still be mobile at the expense of the ability to guard. Insect Glaives are quick, will enable you to attack and evade from the air, and give you access to various Kinsects that allow you to use unique buffs for yourself or debuffs for your enemies. However, Glaives also lack the ability to guard, and individual attacks are weak.Your experience with the weapons system might be completely different though. You may hate the Long Sword and Insect Glaive and instead become an expert with the slow, but mighty Great Sword, or the versatile Sword and Shield. I couldn’t get the hang of those, but that’s another of the extraordinary things about this game, it rewards you for finding your niche and sticking with it.Monster Hunter World has a high focus on multiplayer, but its implementation is so bizarre I spent most of my time in the game hunting alone. What would have been great is persistent drop-in/drop-out sessions. The hub of the game, Astra, is geared perfectly to have multiple players inhabiting it at once, and its scale is such that it feels like an MMO town with plenty of room to run around in.However, that’s not the case. Instead of getting it chill with your friends on and off the hunt, you can only have other players join you when you’ve accepted and posted a quest. You have to invite a friend, then post a quest, then they have to go to the quest board in their game and join your quest. If you (or they) haven’t watched the cutscenes for that quest, they can’t enter it. So, once you have both watched the cutscenes, there’s a lot of waiting, you do the quest, then you both return to the hub. If you want to go on another quest, one of you has to post it and then join it again.Paul’s feature on just how convoluted and odd the co-op multiplayer system is in Monster Hunter World goes into more depth about just how weird the whole thing is, and he draws the same conclusion I do. If you want to play with other people, you’re better off starting a hunt and using an item called an SOS Flare which sends a call out for players to come help you. This bypasses the whole quest board convolution and gets someone right into the game with you. Some quests, namely the optional ones like investigations make things a bit easier, but for a game with a focus on co-op, Monster Hunter World makes it a time-consuming and unfulfilling experience.Hunting the beasts of Monster Hunter World was an enthralling adventure, and there’s just so much content in this game that a review can’t hope to encompass it. There are so many systems, side quests, and nooks and crannies this game has that I can’t do it full justice here. You can catch animals to be your pets and watch them in your room; you have a feline pal called a Palico who comes with you and helps you on your way and is the most adorable, and so much more.Monster Hunter World is bursting with content and is a game that you can easily get over 100 hours in. The downside is that a lot of those 100 or more hours will be by your lonesome. While as a single-player game this title excels, the multiplayer matchmaking can be incredibly clunky and inexplicably doesn’t allow you to stick by another player’s side persistently. However, in a world so vibrant and full of wonderous monsters and environments, questing by yourself is an immensely satisfying experience and once you get the hang of what you can and can’t do in multiplayer, you’ll have plenty of fun with other players. This is the Monster Hunter game that will finally solidify the series in the West in the way it has been in Japan for over a decade and is a terrific experience from start to finish (if you ever truly get finished).9Jason Faulkner is the Senior Editor of Game Revolution and PlayStation LifeStyle.

Monster Hunter World,Chris Carter,Destructoid,https://www.destructoid.com/review-monster-hunter-world-482217.phtml,"darkChop, cut, mince, craft, boil, eat, repeat. The life of a hunter is hard. Especially if you’re a vegetarian controlling one.Monster Hunter‘s core since 2004 has been predicated on grinding and discovering its own esoteric rules and principles. That hasn’t change a lot in 14 years, but Monster Hunter: World’s sleekness makes it a whole lot easier.Monster Hunter: World (PC, PS4 [reviewed with a PS4 Pro], Xbox One) Developer: CapcomPublisher: Capcom Release: January 26, 2018 (PS4/Xbox One) / TBA (PC)MSRP: $59.99Despite some concessions best epitomized by fireflies (known here as scout flies) assisting in lighting the path to your prey, this is still very much the same punishing Monster Hunter. There’s lots of repetition stat-studying and grinding, all so you can get one piece of coveted armor at a time. That’s basically been Capcom’s philosophy on the series for over a decade: give ’em incremental quality-of-life upgrades that are usually standard in other games (lock-on being a highly contentious addition for some reason) and keep the old school base intact.That’s mostly worked for me, having played most of the series throughout the years, but at some point around Monster Hunter 4 I yearned for a new coat of paint. Most iterations, including the myriad “super” editions over the years, just felt too similar to one another. World finally overhauls nearly everything from an artistic standpoint and brings it into the current generation. The main camp of Astero looks stunning and picturesque, like a fully-realized Rufio camp from Hook. Each location, from the lush Ancient Forest to the desolate Rotten Vale, differentiates itself from the pack. But World doesn’t take itself too seriously — there’s a lot of heart and silliness to it all too, perhaps best encapsulated by the classic absurd Palico (read: cat) cooking sequence.The shift to more open maps makes everything feel like less of a corridor simulator without moving directly into the rote “map full of icons” open-world setup that’s commonly found in a lot of western games. There’s still going to be repetition in the sense that you’re re-visiting the same areas, but World generally does a good job of mixing up the enemy layouts or times of day to freshen up repeat excursions. Bringing back expeditions, which are free-roam sessions with no time limit or requirements, was a good decision. They’re an excellent way to remove some of the stress of the standard Monster Hunter grind with activities like fishing and capturing, with unlimited lives.World still has that rewarding conquest loop. I got my ass kicked by a T-Rex, so I basically re-evaluated everything that led me to the moment where he burned me to a crisp. I swapped weapons (which is easy to do since you can downgrade and get your materials back), upgraded a few armor pieces, crafted some more items, grinded out some ingredients for nutrients (potions that increase your max health), and ate some Good Food. Bam! Dude was dead.Boss fights still range from epic, larger-than-life confrontations against insurmountable creatures to mild tedium. While the larger romps are mostly engaging battles featuring ghoulish designs only the Monster Hunter team could come up with, some of the medium-to-large-sized denizens annoyingly run away and force you to constantly babysit them. This is much easier to deal with when you’re playing with friends, as various ranged and swift builds can catch up with them or cut them off, but going at it solo it can be painstakingly slow. Luckily this sort of thing doesn’t happen that often, but when it does, expect to groan audibly (until you return and start to crush bosses like normal enemies, then it feels incredible; battling them in the arena also eliminates the whole chasing step).What wows me the most is that it feels like Monster Hunter has finally entered the modern age. Now I don’t mind the old visuals, nor do I require the cutting edge to play something, but the constant re-hashing of engines and iterations was really getting to me. Capcom is the king of re-touching and re-selling the same “ultra” or “super” editions, and the Monster Hunter series saw plenty of “Ultimate” and “Freedom” versions. We’re probably going to get Monster Hunter Universe at some point, this is true, but right now it’s still crisp and hot out of the oven.It hasn’t shed its skin fully either. The sheer breadth of playstyles is staggering, from the quick dual blades, to the multiple bowgun ranged options, to the tough but rewarding hunting horn. It’s a science at this point, but you can also opt to jump into a stabby or shooty combat style if you want. When you really dig though and start getting to the point where you need to optimize to best some of the bigger beasties, you’ll probably be taken aback by some inside baseball type stuff, like the endless pit of bowgun ammo types. There’s no new weapons in World, which is a bummer, but given how well all of the existing ones mesh together I don’t necessarily need more.Crafting has become more convenient, not necessarily outright easier. There’s a wishlist feature to notify you when you have the proper materials required to create something, and gathering locations are a little more obvious. That’s no better typified than with the aforementioned firefly highlights, otherwise known as “bread crumb trails” in the industry at large, Monster Hunter World‘s most contentious mechanic.While some may feel like this “dumbs down” the flow of the game, I dig the idea of gaining research progression (non-traditional experience that can be spent on things like meals) when locating points of interest such as footprints or scents. It adds to the whole “hunt” feel. It’s also a little more inviting when you need to hunt down a certain enemy type over and over when you can track them directly.This is still Monster Hunter. You’ll hunt, upgrade, hunt some more, and basically repeat until you’re done with the campaign, then you can choose to do it some more with extra quests. Capcom is promising more content for the long haul, but as it stands World feels just as full as any other core release.As for multiplayer, we didn’t get much of a chance to extensively test it out — so we’ll be mostly reporting on that post-launch. Right now lobbies seem to be stable and the chat/squad system is well-implemented (you can emote/message people even during cutscenes and connect with people through groups), which is a good sign. I had a limited pool of players to choose from, but I could join quests in progress and fire off SOS flares to signal other people that I needed help. This series is still fun as hell to team up in.If you’ve been skipping out on Monster Hunter games for a while because they seem to blend together, jumping into World is your chance to get in. Just know that Capcom hasn’t really shaken up the formula enough to piss off veterans or appeal to people who don’t welcome grinding with open arms.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]SuperbA hallmark of excellence. There may be flaws, but they are negligible and won't cause massive damage.

Monster Hunter World,Bill Lavoy,Shacknews,http://www.shacknews.com/article/103318/monster-hunter-world-ps4-review---taming-the-beast,"New to Shacknews? Signup for a Free AccountAlready have an account? Login NowMonster Hunter: World is a brilliant game that often gets in its own way.Several hours into Monster Hunter: World, a buddy and I took on an Anjanath, one of the tougher monsters in the first region you can explore. We paid no attention to its structural and elemental weak points, nor its potential ailments. We didn’t really plan our powders and potions. We simply joined up in the Ancient Forest and went after it, not bothering to fire a flare to bring in more assistance. Two or so hours and three resets later, we called it a night, thoroughly frustrated.With some games, that would have been enough to send me packing for good. You’re looking at the guy who put $130 into For Honor and ended up playing less than 60 minutes. With Monster Hunter: World, though, I wanted to go back, I just didn’t really know why.The next day, I loaded into Monster Hunter: World and brought up the notes the Chief Ecologist had on the Anjanath. I learned about all the things I didn’t bother to study the night before. I took this knowledge to the smithy and forged the proper weapon, then went to the training yard and learned how to use it. I prepared potions and powders to keep me from fainting, then I went back to the Ancient Forest and helped a group of random players dispatch the Anjanath like it was nothing. That was the moment I realized you only get out of Monster Hunter: World what you put in, and I was hooked.Backing up to my first few hours in Monster Hunter: World, it wasn’t just the Anjanath that had me on the brink of quitting, it was also the co-op mechanics. Trying to play Monster Hunter: World with friends is a lot like trying to eat soup with a fork. You can do it, but nothing about it is intuitive. Perhaps I’ve been spoiled by the ease of playing co-op in games like Ghost Recon Wildlands and Destiny 2, but the system Monster Hunter: World uses is bad.For instance, you can only play an assigned story mission together if you and your friend have both progressed far enough. Seems fair, but Monster Hunter World will make you start almost every main story mission solo. You’ll remain by yourself until you watch a cut scene, at which point either you or your friend will have to exit their session to join the other. However, if you are a solo player looking for help from random gamers, the SOS system works quite well, and you’d probably feel that the multiplayer and co-op mechanics are solid. Most of the trouble with co-op is directly related to trying to play with specific people.Monster Hunter: World is best experienced when you’re lost in a cycle of exploring, resource gathering, and crafting. I probably say it too much, but open world games are at their peak when you want to spend time in the environments. I love visiting the Smithy and seeing what it will take to craft my desired armor, looking for a related quest, then heading out to gather the necessary supplies. It’s a system that ensures all the locations and monsters will remain relevant even after you’ve completed the main story.I didn’t care much for the narrative in Monster Hunter: World. The premise was fine but playing it through was forgettable at best. Two encounters with a monster named Zorah Magdaros were so bad I was laughing. Even now, I’m not sure what I did to progress. There were points in the first encounter where my objective was to drive away another monster. I never ended up finding that monster, but apparently it grew bored and took off on its own.The second battle was a tiny bit better, but stilled flawed from start to finish. I found more objectives, but the quest continued to move forward even when I hadn’t completed them. It ended with about 10 minutes of me running back and forth, loading cannons and firing away while someone was screaming at me about how it wasn’t good enough. I was just glad when it was over, although it wasn’t really. There were still more assigned quests to complete and more regions to discover. More cut scenes to watch while you wait for Monster Hunter: World to get out of its own way.I have given Destiny 2 a verbal beatdown that borders on cruel, but Monster Hunter: World could take a few notes about how Bungie handles social spaces. With Destiny 2 I always feel connected. I can be a solo player in the Tower and it feels alive. In Monster Hunter: World, it’s just you in Astera unless you head up to the Gathering Hub. I think I’ve been there twice, and I have no idea why anyone would need to go back. It leaves me feeling somewhat alone when I’m playing, even though I know thousands of others are in the same space. Monster Hunter: World puts the armor, loot, and resource systems of Destiny 2 to shame, but I can’t help feeling like Astera is a missed opportunity as a social space.That lonely feeling continues when you head out on an expedition. Yes, you can fire that SOS and be joined by a few fellow players, but it feels forced. It’s the difference between inviting someone into your home to visit and bumping into strangers while you’re running errands. You may not talk to those strangers, but you take comfort from knowing they’re out and existing in the same space as you. I’m not saying Monster Hunter: World needs to be more like Destiny 2, but there’s a disconnect with the co-op and multiplayer for me.What Monster Hunter: World gets right is your Palico companion. I created Chuck, my real cat with an attitude. Chuck is a genuine benefit when I’m playing alone or even with one other person. He attacks the monsters I’m battling, heals me, digs up extra resources, and manages to work “meow” into everything he has to say. He has his own armor and gets a weapon, and I find myself caring just as much about his gear as I do my own. It really feels like Chuck, and I’m equally as defensive about him in-game as I am in life. When a monster attacks him things get belligerent, although in truth he saves me far more often than I save him.The Palico system is one of the best in Monster Hunter: World. You can level your Palico up to make them more efficient, and they act as a gadget delivery system for perks you unlock. I can count on Chuck for a timely heal, or to toss down a Shock Trap when I need to pin a monster down and cause some damage. I can even connect with my friend’s Palicos when they’re offline, taking two companions with me, both of which put in work.The studying and planning in Monster Hunter: World is perfection. The actual combat, however, can be a bit wonky. Capcom has done a great job with the environments, making them as much a part of the fight as the weapons. I’m a big fan of using verticality to my advantage, jumping on the backs of monsters and stabbing them in the face. The problem is there’s just too much inconsistency. Mounting a monster feels like it’s as much about luck as it is skill. That system, like the monster’s hit boxes, feels sloppy.As far as striking a monster with your weapon, that feels tight. I can’t recall thinking that I’d landed a blow that didn’t register. The problem comes from the monsters moving around with you in close proximity. Yes, I get that they are huge and you’d get trampled, and that’s fine, but what isn’t fine is when you’re consistently getting knocked down, or even fainting, and you’re certain you got out of the way. Perhaps once or twice, but time and time again I was left feeling cheated, and that’s a tough one to take when it sends your team back to Astera as the final faint.The monster AI is another example of what Capcom got right. These beasts go about their business in the world whether you’re there or not. They move between zones and live their lives. Often you can pass by them and, so long as you don’t go mean mugging them, they’ll just continue on the path. Most monsters won’t fuss with you if you don’t give them reason, although there are exceptions.Even when the fight begins, the monster AI is on point. There are no health bars, so you must depend on visual cues and monster behavior to get a sense of how you’re doing. Chop a tail off and the beast will howl. Hurt it enough and it will limp off towards its nest, desperate to recover. This often makes me feel like I’m the real monster in each encounter. I’ve attacked this creature in its habitat, often unprovoked, and when it is so hurt that it limps away to try and recover from near death, I hunt it down and finish the job. That’s some nonsense right there, but I do love my fancy Zorah Magdaros armor.Peak monster hunting is done in groups of at least two. My buddy prefers to strike from range and I like to fight in a phone booth. Eye gouging, foot stomps, and Chuck’s claws taking chunks of flesh. It’s a messy style, and it’s most effective when I have a co-op friend there to provide heals and ranged distractions. I can count on my pal to draw the monster near a cliff so I can try for a mount or lure the beast into a trap where it can be put to sleep. Things get a bit more hectic and unorganized with a group of four, especially if a couple are random players, but group fighting is almost always better than going it alone.I’m on the fence with the visuals of Monster Hunter: World. The monsters look spectacular, and the environments feel very much alive. I played on PS4 and it’s a good-looking game, but as a PC player, I mumbled to myself more than once about how I couldn’t wait for it to come out on Steam this fall. Give me that glorious Diablos fight in 2K with about 90 fps and I’ll dance at your wedding. However, even as far as the PS4 is concerned, games like Horizon Zero Dawn and the Uncharted series look better. That’s not a dig at Monster Hunter: World. Those are two stunning games and I don’t feel like Monster Hunter: World is far behind.I’m more than 70 hours deep into Monster Hunter: World. Although my copy was provided by Capcom, the price of admission for the average gamer is well worth it. My interest is waning, though. Maybe I’m asking too much, but I really wanted a living, breathing game. Even though Monster Hunter: World does have events, it falls short of what it would take to keep me invested for the long haul, but that’s okay. As a first-time player of the series, Monster Hunter: World has given me unique experiences and memories that, for better or worse, other games will be measured against for years to come. That has to be a win.This review is based on a PS4 download code provided by Capcom.

Monster Hunter World,Alex Donaldson,VG247,https://www.vg247.com/2018/01/25/monster-hunter-world-review/,"Monster Hunter's return to consoles is a confident, barnstorming series best.In many ways the Monster Hunter series was ahead of its time. Though the fairly similar Phantasy Star Online predates it, Monster Hunter's 4-player co-operative action RPG design and the treadmill of hunting for drops to get better gear has a whiff of that which has recently made Destiny so compelling about it. That makes now the absolutely perfect time for Monster Hunter World, the series' big-budget return to platforms that can properly support this design with a near-constant internet connection.The result is exactly what you'd expect: the same exciting-yet-methodical monster-smashing combat atop a game that is now wired up in a manner that's designed to keep its already satisfying loop of combat, upgrade and preparation even more fresh. This is a game where login bonuses, limited time events and drop-in, drop-out multiplayer sit happily alongside the same old hardcore beast-hunting action, now also bolstered by a narrative that's delivered in a fashion more befitting of a high-profile console game. 
 
This rebuilt vision of Monster Hunter feels like a truly smart, forward-thinking improvement to the series. It's an impressive leap forwards.If you're a fan of Monster Hunter's previous outings this might initially be a little shocking. When the game gets going and within five minutes you're clambering atop a beast the size of a small town it all feels a little alien. This isn't for those people, of course, since while they might appreciate it this exists mainly to draw in fans of the more bombastic, story-driven role playing games that are far more common on console. Very quickly, however, World reasserts its true identity. It is still Monster Hunter as all hell.Monster Hunter is stripped back to its very core here - and when rebuilt, it has been done so without many of the foibles and series conventions that made it difficult to approach. Beefier hardware allows for areas to now be one seamless zone, which in turn led designers to make healing a more simplistic affair. Hardcore fans bemoaned that you can now heal while moving, but this is a compromise, since the series' typically unforgiving nature is instead present in how the health bar gradually refills as you drink your potion. If you're hit midway through a drinking animation, the potion is consumed but the bar stops filling, part of your precious restorative wasted.Little touches like this run through Monster Hunter World as its very foundation, and this rebuilt vision of Monster Hunter feels like a truly smart, forward-thinking improvement to the series. It's an impressive leap forwards. Much of what made it great is still there, such as the fourteen different classes of weapon each with their own unique abilities and often quite considered method of combat. If you want to dive in learning outrageous combos you can, but combat is also made approachable with more simple weapon options that'll instead let less confident players focus on the other major star of this entry, the world itself. 
 
Depending on who you ask at Capcom, the World suffix of this game's title has a few different meanings. For one it's a series first worldwide release. That release also reflects a wider development philosophy - to make a game that might have broader appeal outside Japan, something previous entries have struggled to do. I like to think the real reason is the world itself, however - that's the star of the show, with each area of the game as alive as the beasts that roam it.Each of Monster Hunter World's zones is teeming with detail, from the five main hunting areas through to the endearing, pleasant hub area of Astera. When you're out hunting the world is your greatest ally, filled with loot that can be crafted into helpful items and even helpful creatures and environmental hazards that can be used to trap your targets. If you're really stuck one of the most thrilling things to do is to turn nature against itself by luring large boss monsters into each other's paths to cause a ferocious battle. While Monster Hunter World looks lovely visually, this is where the extra horsepower of the consoles seems to truly go - into artificial intelligence and interesting systems that interlock and interact in ways that have even left the developers surprised. Sometimes the little touches of that world are what surprise the most - the things you can barely notice. There's some sublime audio work going on in the background, and hardcore fans who want to turn off damage numbers and other display elements will find plenty of visual and aural clues as to how they're doing in battle. Speaking of combat - streamlined though many areas of World are, the series' methodical, carefully-paced but energetic combat remains, placing a constant emphasis on learning the behaviors of enemies so you can time your attacks and position yourself accordingly. When things go well, it feels sublime. A highlight are the blunt force weapons - the sense of weight and impact when they hit home really is something to behold. 
 
The manner in which Capcom has balanced out the needs of their existing hardcore fans and newcomers is admirable and impressive. There's no messing about at the onset - after some typically chipper story exposition, you're thrown into things. Here are the three or four places you need to know about in the hub area - off you go to hunt. There's few intrusive tutorial screens, so if you know what you're doing or are just feeling confident the on-ramp to get into the actual game is remarkably short. Crucially, however, if you want help it's never far away and has never been better.If you know what you're doing or are just feeling confident the on-ramp to get into the actual game is remarkably short. Crucially, however, if you want help it's never far away and has never been better.You can now try out weapons and practice with them in a new training area, and it's easier than ever to earmark things you want to craft, see what ingredients you need for new gear or upgrades and see what you're going to look like once you equip it. Out in the field your Scoutflies act as a sensible compromise for gathering and tracking, taking on the form of green aura that highlights items you can interact with and once you've found enough clues out in the environment will begin to lay out a Fable 2 style glistening breadcrumb trail that'll lead you right to your target.There's a decent selection of old and new monsters on offer to hunt and capture, and though this isn't the largest cast of beasts in the series Monster Hunter World makes up for that with its sheer sense of scale and ambition. It feels like there's more variety to anything you might attempt at any given time, and the newly beefed-up story is a decent-quality narrative that's characterful enough to entertain but not so heavy-handed that it distracts or detracts from what the series is really about, which is that core loop and the systems that make it work so brilliantly. 
 
Strangely enough, one of the few flaws in Monster Hunter World relates to one of the areas with the most exciting potential - online play. The game facilitates drop-in, drop-out play, but it's not quite that simple, with a system in place where players must have experienced all the cutscenes in a mission on their own before they can join another player or have any other players join them on that same mission. This means either soloing the mission first time out or heading in, seeing cutscenes, backing out and then going in with your party - it feels pretty clumsy.This is a one-time issue for the main story assignment missions, however, and the other online features such as the SOS flare work fine once you've pushed past this little wrinkle. Monster Hunter World is really designed to be played with others once you get to the higher-rank, high-ticket items - while you can solo much of the game, the heart of the game is in tackling its co-operative content as a well-oiled team. This entry keeps that intact, and even with a few bumps in the road online is far easier than the hoops one had to jump through on handheld machines. The truth is, Monster Hunter has always been brilliant - but it's always been niche. Monster Hunter World feels like the right game to finally crack that - a game that makes smart changes that might finally mean that a wider audience will at last fully understand, experience and enjoy that brilliance. It's not without a few minor flaws, but it's an excellent, satisfying game - and an incredibly easy recommendation to all, not just hardcore fans.Version tested: PS4, on a PS4 Pro.

Monster Hunter World,Jelani James,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/monster-hunter-world-review/,"Brand New World, same old Monster Hunter.Since its debut on the PlayStation 2 in 2004, the Monster Hunter series has become known for its steep learning curve and high difficulty. And while that didn’t stop it from thriving over the years in Japan, the same can’t be said about its fate in the West where it only gained the attention of a relatively small crowd.Now, in 2018, Capcom is looking to turn things around with the release of Monster Hunter: World. Not only does it simplify the traditional Monster Hunter formula, but it’s skipping over handhelds and moving to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The reason? To widen its appeal to a general audience.When I heard those intentions back at E3 2017, I feared the worst. As a series veteran (2004 – 2013), I understood Monster Hunter to be the type of series that you could succeed in so long as you’re willing to put the work in. As such, I assumed that any attempt to bastardize the series’ formula to accommodate players who weren’t willing to put in that work previously would only serve to piss off MH veterans and end in disaster.I was wrong.At its core, Monster Hunter: World is as genuine a Monster Hunter title as it gets, featuring the many mechanics and complexities that has earned it the undying love of its fanbase. Yet, Capcom has managed to take many of those mechanics and complexities, and streamline them, making them easier to understand and the game itself more accessible.Regardless of your skill level, many of these changes will be more than welcome. In fact, series veterans will likely question why it took so long for Capcom to implement them. There are many such quality-of-life improvements, but the three that stuck out to me the most were the ones made to gathering, crafting and quests.In the past, gathering used to be an arduous process, not only requiring players to have specific items to collect certain materials, but you would have to sit through an animation every time you wanted to do so.This is now a thing of the past.Now, not only do you no longer need those items clogging up your inventory, but the actual collection process (outside of a few specific instances) is instantaneous.These changes go hand-in-hand with those made to crafting, as you can now select certain items for the game to automatically make provided you have the right ingredients. Making potions mid-fight used to be something that required finesse. This time, all you have to do is find an herb and the game will do the rest.Completing quests also used to be similarly arduous since you only complete one at a time and were sent back to town immediately afterwards. This is also a thing of the past.Aside from story quests and side quests, referred to as Assigned Quests and Investigations, respectively, there are now “bonus” missions, called Bounties, which you are always active and can be completed at any time. As an added bonus, completing the former types of quests no longer automatically sends you back to town, often allowing players to choose between staying in your current location to either pick up an additional quest or go on an Expedition to free roam, or returning to Astera, your base of operations, to craft new gear, resupply, etc.And though these improvements do make for an easier Monster Hunter title, World still isn’t easy.As previously stated, Monster Hunter: World is a genuine MH game through and through, and it plays host to a plethora of monsters who are more than willing to smack you around should you become complacent.Towering above them all is the massive, magma-encrusted Zorah Magdaros who provides the “prime impetus” for your journey. As an Elder Dragon, Zorah Magdaros is in the midst of a once-in-a-decade migratory period, known as the Elder Crossing, where it crosses the sea and towards a newly-discovered continent known as the New World. Your goal? Capture it and find out the meaning behind its movements.It’s a rather tenuous setting, sure, but that has never been the series’ strong point. No one plays Monster Hunter for the story, after all. Its focal points have been and always will be its environments and monsters; and Monster Hunter: World earns full marks in both.To call the environments in Monster Hunter: World a marvel would be an understatement. They’re large, imperfect, diverse, vibrant and asymmetrical. From the Ancient Forest’s creeping vines and massive, intertwining branches, to the Rotten Vale’s fetid pools of acid and seemingly endless corpses, each location is unique, possessing an aesthetic and ambiance which differs from the rest.We’re not dealing with monotone, manufactured environments here. Between the differing terrain, flora and fauna, the areas in Monster Hunter: World feel like a genuine ecosystem.And lurking within each of these them are massive monsters who stand at the top of the food chain, leaving you with the unenviable position of having to face off against them with little more than a small — yet deadly — cat, known as a Palico, as back up.Each monster, from the moment you set eyes upon it from a distance to when you capture or kill it for parts to make new equipment, is unique thanks to its appearance and the many ways it can tear you limb from limb. Though a Paolumu with its ability to inflate itself like a balloon and use its increased size to flatten you from above doesn’t quite compare to the Odogaron’s quick movements, vicious bites and sharpened claws, both are fully capable of killing you if given the opportunity.
These fights evoke a unique mix of anxiety and excitement in you, where you’re painfully aware that even one mistake can lead to your undoing. Every move you make, every step you take is a deliberate action done to ensure you don’t add to your opponent’s tally of kills. If you consistently make the right actions, the monster will respond appropriately. Targeting the forearms will break its claws, jumping on its back will cause it to frantically struggle in a bid to knock you off, attacking the tail will dismember it, hitting the legs will cause it to topple over — if there is a way to interact with the monster, it will have a special way of showing it. Keep it up and the monster will eventually reveal a tell — limping — to show that it’s weakened. At that point, all you have to do is follow it and seal the deal.Of course, you’re not going in these fights empty-handed. You’ll have 14 different types of weapons to choose from, each with their own set of strengths and weaknesses. Some are straightforward like the Great Sword, which is particularly effective when you charge it up and let loose a super-powered strike for high-damage; but others, like the Insect Glaive, with its air dashes and Kinsect companion, require a bit more finesse to use properly.With so many weapons to choose from, some might be inclined to try and use all of them. Don’t. Every weapon is viable, so its best to head to the practice area and familiarize yourself with one weapon before branching out to more later on. In my case, I wanted to try something new so I started with the Charge Blade before moving on to the Gunlance and Heavy Bowgun (my usual go-to weapon).And if you’re having trouble taking out an enemy on your own, you can use the new SOS flare to summon other players for help. Upon using it, the player’s room will automatically be available to join and others can choose to respond, thus allowing them to instantly render aid. It’s not a flawless system, though. For example, other people can’t join your room if you’re watching a cutscene.When it does work, the extra players allow you to formulate and execute more complex strategies using items like traps and bombs, potentially making light work of otherwise dangerous enemies.All in all, there are plenty of ways to take enemies down, but it’s on you to figure out how to make it happen — Monster Hunter: World just makes it easier to do.As a long time fan of the MH series, I’m pleasantly surprised with Monster Hunter: World. I assumed this game would be dumbed-down to oblivion, but I was wrong: Capcom pulled it off. It’s fluid, many mechanics are intuitive and it endeavors to explain the ones that aren’t. It takes the best of Monster Hunter and offers them in a way that entices newcomers without repulsing long-time fans.The only gripe I had were the lack of areas and amount of monsters — both of which will likely be remedied with confirmed DLC, making it a minor gripe about an otherwise excellent package. If you’re a fan of the series then World is a must-buy. And for everyone else? Pick it up anyway.
- This article was updated on March 8th, 2018 Attack of the Fanboy / GAME REVIEWS / Monster Hunter: World Review"
Monster Hunter World,Chris White,God is a Geek,http://www.godisageek.com/reviews/monster-hunter-world-review/,"January 26, 2018.There was one hunt I participated in that made me understand the world’s fascination with Monster Hunter properly – one so exciting and tense I will never forget. The games have always been this way, but not as big or as beautiful as seeing it all on such a powerful platform. Within the Ancient Forest, I was out hunting an Anjanath. I had been fighting it for well over half an hour, and my Palico and I had taken such a beating, we were almost done. As he retreated temporarily up to a Rathian’s nest, we followed ready to put our final effort into his destruction. With the few potions I had, we closed in on his tracks and prepared to do whatever we could to kill him, but something both insane and helpful happened to us.Within the nest that the Anjanath had headed towards, the Rathian awoke and the two started to fight. It was brutal, loud, and fascinating to watch. Then, with one almighty swoop, the Rathian grabbed the Anjanath in its claws and flew high into the air. As he soared high above the both of us, the Rathian let go and dropped this humongous T-Rex from 200 feet in the air, doing a horrific amount of damage to him, and allowing us to put the final sword to the heart, granting us the victory, and letting us collect our prize. Once you get to grips with the game’s complex systems and lengthy battles, Monster Hunter: World is about as rewarding as it gets, and the game is filled with watercooler moments you’ll be sharing with friends for weeks and months to come.Of course, playing with friends makes all the difference. Teaming up isn’t particularly hard to do, and you can limit whether you want random players or just your pals via a password system. Make no bones about it, distracting a monster while your friend leaps onto it, straddling it and unleashing a barrage of attacks culminating in a kind of super attack that puts the monster down for a bit, allowing even more of a beating to take place, is incredible. Starting out just trying to find tracks of the beast you’re hunting together is the calm before the storm, but the eventual chase is just mesmeric, and there’s no question the game is better played with friends. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves a little. You play as a hunter from the Fifth Fleet sent to aid the Research Commission in the capture of an elder dragon known as Zorah Magdaros. The story is incredibly simple to grasp, and the structure is also basic, which both aids your gameplay and your progression. Equip your weapon, armour, and other items, then go into the field and hunt the next monster. Quests are relatively easy to find, and you’re also allowed to go on Expeditions, which are essentially opportunities for you to go out and gather items, hunt monsters not in one of the quests and earn more Research Points.There are 14 weapon types to choose from, and different armour sets you can craft or buy, depending on your style. It’s hugely important to try every weapon, or at least a wide range of them because they all have significant strengths and weaknesses. World doesn’t have a leveling up system for your character, which is refreshing: instead, you kill monsters and grab their remains to craft better stuff. Certain monsters have resistances to fire and ice, among other things, so it’s always important to read the stats at the Smithy.I started off using the hammer because it did lots of damage, and in the beginning the first few monsters are slow and relatively easy to take down. But as you get through each hunt, the monsters react differently to your presence, and have plenty of different attributes that you’ll need to adapt to. For example, the Tobi-Kadachi is a wyvern that can fly from tree to tree, charging its body until its electrified, and will fly towards you causing huge amounts of damage. It’s difficult to get in close because it’s fast, so even when it takes a breather, you can’t be guaranteed it’ll be back on the move and out of reach once again. I foolishly went in with the Gunlance (a strong sword doubling up as a gun) but the Tobi-Kadachi kept getting away. The Radobaan was much easier to battle with the Gunlance because a lot of its bonelike spikes that protruded from its body could be blown off with the gun, and the sword could do damage to its guts. As you fight each monster, they gradually get worn down, and body parts break off giving you some indication just how you’re doing, but generally you’re never sure how you’re doing until it visibly skulks away, and that’s when you know you’re close. It can become frustrating because you can spend more than 45 minutes a fight, and you can end up fighting the same creature a few times before you’re successful. There are no health bars for monsters, either, so you will need to study their form. They will turn tail and run when wounded, and when near death they might even start limping. These are fights that require you to understand your foe in order to overcome them.Your best bet is to tool up and use other items at your disposal like poisons and bombs, but again, you need to equip the right weapon to use these. The slinger is pretty handy because it allows you to pull down rock formations, throw bombs at monsters, and lets you swing around the environments. The bow is a favourite weapon of mine because of the variety of arrows you can craft. In fact, the Anjanath I talked about earlier was taken down solely by the bow – something I’m very pleased about.Crafting is a massive part of Monster Hunter and knowing just how to do this isn’t always clear. A lot of tutorials in the game aren’t as descriptive as they could be, and in the first 5 hours or so, frustration may seep in as you haven’t found out how much of the things you’ve picked up work. Spend time in the menus, take a good luck around the Tradeyard and experiment. Much of the game is what you make of it, and if you’re willing to spend time learning, you’ll find the gratification you deserve. You’ll spend a lot of the time in the Smithy, and it’d be well worth your time doing so. He’ll craft you new armour, upgrade weapons and armour, and forge new ones. Using Armour Cores is important, and you’ll get these by defeating monsters and completing bounties such as finding bugs, wildlife, or creatures within the different ecosystems. There are tons of things to pick up and collect, but everything serves a purpose, and there is a lot of things to find, but thankfully your Scoutflies are massively resourceful. They form a glowing green cloud that can help locate these resources and even monster tracks, mucus, or bits of their skin that may have fallen off whilst they lived their lives in the New World. Speaking of the New World, I’ve rarely seen such beautiful environments. Horizon Zero Dawn did it excellently, and Monster Hunter: World follows suit. The Ancient Forest is a deep jungle filled with all sorts of weird wildlife, but the Coral Highlands were a highlight for me: it looked like an underwater world without the water, so weird plant life and colourful corals covered the walls and the ground, while glowing blue flies filled the air, giving you the illusion that they were air bubbles. As for the monsters living within the different ecosystems: they are remarkable. So divine it can be difficult to go after them. I spent a lot of time observing their habits, and the way they lived within them, namely when I was using one of the Special Tools called a Ghillie Suit. Capcom has designed a game so intricate and lifelike that many other developers should take note. On PS4 Pro it’s worth noting that the performance mode boasts a reasonably solid 60fps at the small sacrifice of some visual fidelity. It’s a small price to pay for that higher frame rate, and one can only ponder how incredible it’ll look on a high-end PC.There are so many other elements to Monster Hunter: World that add so much to gameplay. The cat-like Palicoes feel essential to your success, mainly finding items for you, and distracting monsters so you can get a good hit in or two whilst their backs are turned. You can also give them new equipment and buy new bits and pieces for them. The canteen is also a great element to the game because the Palico chef will cook you up a special meal that’ll grant you extra boosts that’ll last for the duration of the Quest you’re about to embark on.The characters you’ll meet are generally two dimensional, and the voice acting is a bit hammy, but it doesn’t impact the game because the greatness of the hunt trumps all. Monster Hunter: World is such an enjoyable game filled with lots to do, and although many of the systems aren’t explained as well as they should be, when you’re out in the different ecosystems hunting your next target, the satisfaction you feel after killing these monsters is a feeling few games manage to encapsulate. As it stands, Monster Hunter: World is a tremendously fun game slightly let down by the way it tries to explain its complexities. That said, if this is a series you’ve always been intrigued by, it’s by far the easiest to get in to. Finally we can all share the majesty of Monster Hunter, without losing the complexities that make it so unique.Magnificent ecosystems
Monsters are beautifully designed
Completion of quests is satisfyingSystems are complex and not always explained well
A lot to learn
Battles can last far too longFrom the gorgeous visuals to the design in its monsters and ecosystems, Capcom has made the best Monster Hunter game yet.

Monster Hunter World,Mike Minotti,GamesBeat,https://venturebeat.com/2018/01/25/monster-hunter-world-review-beautiful-and-rewarding-no-matter-how-you-play/,"Connect with top gaming leaders in Los Angeles at GamesBeat Summit 2023 this May 22-23. Register here.Monster Hunter went big with this latest installment. The action role-playing series had found a comfortable place in the handheld world, but Monster Hunter: World brings the franchise to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One when it launches on January 26 (I played it on my PlayStation 4). A PC version is following later this year.I’ve dabbled with Monster Hunter in the past. I’ve enjoyed it, but I never became addicted. But Monster Hunter: World is impressive. This isn’t an updated version of some portable game. It’s beautiful in a way I’d never have expected from this series. The world is lush with life, the sunsets are stunning, and the monsters move with convincing animations and personalities that make them believable despite their outrageous designs. If you told me a game would have me fight a giant lightning lizard that’s part flying squirrel, I’d have assumed it would be comedic. But in Monster Hunter: World, this creature is majestic and frightening.Monster Hunter: World has a ton of content, and it’s constantly rewarding you for delving deeper.Above: My hunter is bald like me. That’s what character creation has come to in my life.The huntGamesBeat Summit 2023Join the GamesBeat community in Los Angeles this May 22-23. You’ll hear from the brightest minds within the gaming industry to share their updates on the latest developments.Most of Monster Hunter: World revolves around, well, hunting monsters. These encounters usually have two phases. At first, you’re tracking your prey. You explore and look for signs of the monster from things like footprints and claw marks. Find enough of these, and you can begin to track the beast via some fireflies (yeah, it’s another waypoint system, but it’s a pretty one).When you find the monster, you have a lot of options. You can just run in and start swinging your weapon. You can lay traps. You can search for higher ground so you can jump on its back. These fights are long and difficult, so preparation is often necessary. Most beasts will try to run away from you after taking a beating, so you’ll have to give chase, track them again, or take the opportunity to collect yourself and heal up.Basically, a lot is going on. These fights are interesting and dynamic, since you can approach them in so many different ways. Even the environment can have an impact. A monster can fall into a pit, or a bigger creature can appear and insert himself into the fight. You’re not just spamming an attack button and occasionally dodging or countering an attack.Above: It’s a monster’s world.The varietyWeapons dictate your playstyle, and each one has a different feel. Some are straightforward, like giant swords or hammers that are slow to swing but deal a lot of damage. Others are much more complex. For example, a bagpipe/giant club can attack enemies while creating songs that buff players. You can try all these options and find a style that suits you. I know I thought the bagpipes were cool and all, but I went with a simpler giant sword.Variety also comes via upgrades. When you’re wandering the world, you can collect plants, ore, bugs, and more. You also harvest parts from monsters. You can use these to craft items like potions, ammo, and — most importantly — armor and weapons. After almost every hunt, you’ll have parts to help you upgrade or create something new.Easy multiplayerYou can play Monster Hunter: World alone just fine, but the game makes it easy to quest with others. You can host your own session or join others from the game’s main hub town. Once connected, players go about their business until one starts a quest. At that point, others can opt in to join or stay behind at the town waiting for a different activity. You can also join players if they’re in the middle of a quest.If you want even faster cooperative play, you can shoot a flare during missions that enables other players to join you immediately. You can also search for others who shot a flare at your base. It makes it easy to quickly ask for help or jump into another person’s session.Above: Get em!The beautyMonster Hunter: World is often stunning. The game’s hub, a multi-level base made of tents, ships, and giant bones, is one of the cooler video game locations I’ve seen in some time. I played Monster Hunter: World on a PlayStation 4 Pro, and the 4K and HDR settings made the colors and lighting effects stand out.The game’s levels teem with life and magnificent vistas. Tracking down monsters is made much more enjoyable just because the world is so interesting to look at.The world also has plenty of character. You can eat a meal before going out on a quest to get a buff to stats like attack power. But you don’t just navigate a menu. A funny and clever cutscene of cat creatures preparing your meal plays out. Moments like that add a lot of character to Monster Hunter: World.Above: Pretty stuff.RepetitionHunting monsters is fun. But it does begin to feel familiar. Although the beasts have unique abilities, a lot of fights play out the same. You track them, you beat them up a bit, they flee, you chase, you beat them up some more.Monster Hunter: World is one of the more rewarding action role-playing games I’ve played in recent years. The game is enjoyable either solo or with other players, and it manages to take advantage of modern hardware to envelop you in a beautiful world.I never got into Monster Hunter before, but now I can’t wait for this game to officially be out, so I have more people to play with.Score: 90/100Monster Hunter: World is out on January 26 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

Create Account I’ve always marvelled at video games’ potential to bridge cultural gaps. Mario adventures, for example, transcend language and ethnicity, scratching the same itch for people of different backgrounds and experiences all over the world. An eight-year-old boy in Canada can have just as much fun playing as a 60-year-old woman in Brazil, and for more or less the same reasons: The satisfaction of landing a perfect leap on a goomba, the pleasure of teleporting through pipes, the rewarding tinkling sound that comes with collecting coins.But not all video games make the transition between borders so easily. Take, for example, Monster Hunter, a series of multiplayer-focused fantasy RPGs that pits groups of player-controlled hunters against massive monsters in epic battles. A cultural behemoth in Japan for the last decade and a half – Monster Hunter has the same sort of mainstream recognition on the streets of Tokyo as Star Wars does here – it’s been a much harder sell beyond its home borders.Sign up to receive the daily top stories from the Financial Post, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.A welcome email is on its way. If you don't see it, please check your junk folder.The next issue of Financial Post Top Stories will soon be in your inbox. We encountered an issue signing you up. Please try again The reasons for this are well documented, and basically boil down to this: It’s a game best played sitting around with friends. You get a group of four people together, everyone pulls out a device, and the hunt begins. And in Japan there has been no shortage of avid Monster Hunter players at school and work, in cafes, or on trains. This sort of social gaming just isn’t particularly popular in Europe and North America, where players are more accustomed to hooking up with one another – often strangers rather than friends – over great distances online.Also keeping Westerners at bay is the fact that Monster Hunter takes a while to really become interesting. Its depth and sophistication are among its key selling points, but developing an appreciation for its tactics and strategies takes time and effort. In Japan, experienced players help rookies and the learning process becomes part of the fun. Outside of Japan, players are left to parse the game’s intricacies – including a seemingly endless array of items and collectibles with unique purposes that require experimentation to fully understand – largely on their own, without anyone to help show them the ropes. Understandably, many lose interest before an appreciation takes hold.However, Monster Hunter’s developers at Osaka-based Capcom did not give up on non-Japanese players. As new entries continued to arrive on PSP, PlayStation Vita, and 3DS, the designers worked hard to make online play more appealing, provided better tutorials and explainer videos, and continued to refine the game’s systems to make them less intimidating. And the series has, slowly but surely, begun to grow its audience beyond its home nation. It’s by no means a global blockbuster, but the Monster Hunter brand has become viable and recognizable in Western gaming circles.It was understanding all of this – but having no more than a few hours of experience myself trying a couple of earlier entries in the series – that I decided to give Monster Hunter: World, which just launched for Xbox One and PlayStation 4, a serious go. And I’ve come away pleasantly surprised by how much I’ve enjoyed it.I’m not nearly far enough along to issue a proper review (it’s an enormous game, with tutorials still popping up regularly at a point when many other games would be rolling their credits), but my early impressions are positive enough that I’ve no intention to stop playing any time soon.It is, as expected, vastly complex. I’m around 15 hours in and I feel like I’m just beginning to understand how to use various consumable items, tools, and strategies effectively during hunts. But it’s designed such that you can experience a lot of success early on even without comprehending how everything works.Much of what’s going on is visual and intuitive, meaning that satisfaction can be derived simply from messing around. Attack button combinations specific to the weapon you’re using are helpfully displayed in the top right corner of the screen as they come available, and consumable items and actions – such as sharpening your blade on a whetstone – are available from radial and scrolling menus while playing without needing to pause the action.  You don’t even need to hook up with other players if you don’t want to. Hunts are designed so that soloists can take down even large monsters playing alone, and I’ve successfully completed many quests on my own. That said, you’re likely to be a lot less stressed if you join up with a few other players. Big monsters can take a long time to slay – typically 20 or 30 minutes of tracking and attacking – and having allies around to back you up can allay a lot of stress. Introverts needn’t be worried; matchmaking is a breeze, and conversation isn’t mandatory. You can even start a hunt on your own, then send up an SOS flare to call in more hunters if you start to feel overwhelmed. A full squad of allies arrived within a minute or two each time I asked for help.Still, I suspect that people who make an effort to play together with friends will have more fun than those who don’t. There’s support for clans (called squads), and groups of friends who communicate and strategize are likely to be a lot more effective teams than those that don’t.But I’m here to tell you that if you tend to play fantasy RPGs alone you ought not be put off by the prospect of needing to call for support in Monster Hunter: World. It’s surprisingly easy and painless.One area in which traditional solo players are bound to be a little disappointed, though, is storytelling. Monster Hunter: World is a game concerned first and foremost with gratifying mechanics and spectacular action – it is a gorgeous play, despite occasional frame rate hiccups – rather than memorable characters or narrative. As members of the Fifth Fleet, our hunters are among the latest to arrive on a new continent to study and quell the local monster population, including a mountain-sized, magma-spewing dragon. That’s about as deep as the tale gets, from what I’ve experienced. More rock, less talk, as the old saying goes, for better and worse.The game does, however, do a terrific job of world building. Or, more specifically, ecology building. The range of virtual flora and fauna is unequalled in my experience of games, and watching how everything interacts is fascinating. I’ve learned on an instinctual level where to look for certain kinds of mushrooms and plants. I’ve come to recognize different types of creatures’ behaviour and which species tend to be friendly or aggressive toward each other. And the various environments I’ve explored enjoy a kind of structured yet somehow natural convolution, including dizzying verticality.Having the opportunity to explore and understand such a captivating world helps make up for the often bland characters that inhabit it.I’m not sure Monster Hunter: World will finally transform the franchise into the worldwide hit Capcom clearly envisions, but I can’t imagine that it won’t at least help grow the series’ popularity beyond Japan. It is surprisingly accessible, especially given the property’s reputation for being off-putting. And it’s that rare game that grows with the player, with new strategies and possibilities becoming apparent as your abilities evolve. I can see myself continuing to play on and off for months to come, getting better and trying new tactics all the while.And that, if nothing else, earns Monster Hunter: World an enthusiastic recommendation for anyone interested in the idea of seeing if they have what it takes to combat roaring, furry, fire-spewing bird dinosaurs.

Monster Hunter World,Calvin Neill Trager,GamingTrend,http://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/forgiving-intimidation-a-monster-hunter-world-review/,"This was a collaboration between two of our members: Calvin Trager and Codi Spence. Codi Spence had the more positive experience with the game, while Calvin Trager had a positive experience despite the things that jarred him.Monster Hunter: World, developed and published by Capcom, is taking the world by storm (pun intended), introducing players to its fantastical setting, filled with a variety of menacing monsters. A third-person action role-playing game, Monster Hunter: World does an amazing job building and hyping you up from hunt to hunt, as you conquer more and more dangerous beasts with stronger and more impressive tools built from the fallen threats of the wild. The depth the game has to offer is strikingly intense, and the scale it’s presented on is massive to behold, but the game does a great job in its opening hours making itself accessible to new players who are willing to commit.Having such adorable companions doesn’t hurt. Just don’t think about the ethical implications of the happy servants too hard.The game’s opening pitch, its first action sequence, has you recovering and fleeing from your wrecked ship out at sea, destroyed by the enormous Zorah Magdaros. The sheer size of him helps set the tone for what will eventually come, which will stay in the back of your mind as you work your way through the smaller monsters littering the first combat zone. The game’s narrative in these opening hours constantly reminds you of the looming threat of the mountain that is Zorah, from quests that have you hunting smaller critters as big as you to the first wave of the titular monsters that are as huge as a modern day home, promising you an epic adventure later down the line all while engaging you in these satisfying hunts. From there the plot simply exists to perpetuate the hunts themselves, but as a slice of life story from the perspective of a hunter, you’ll never notice.Before the fighting even begins, the character creator is a joy to go through. It has a strong variety of options, including almost any hair color, various voices to choose from, and even the option to make each of your hunter’s eyes a different color, which both of our reviewers immediately drew satisfaction from. This same care was taken for the customization of your Palico, aka your cat helper, and helps you create a truly personal pair. While trivial compared to the intended scope of the game, the level of customization is appreciated, and the game does a good job letting you indulge in the characters you customize from cutscene to cutscene.Though some of the faces this game makes are a little silly, if not terrifying. Try flipping through the smile options in the character creator. You won’t be disappointed.Right off the bat, the base versions of all 14 weapon types are available for use, and this is one of Monster Hunter’s strongest traits as a game series. If you enjoy any other third-person combat game, there’s a weapon and play style that fits almost perfectly for you. God of War fans will find peace with the Dual Blades, as they hack and slash to victory. Dynasty Warriors fans will find satisfying combos to fill with the Longsword or Charge Blade. Dark Souls fans will find their unstoppable march in the Lance or Gunlance. Kingdom Hearts fans, particularly those that grind the end game, will find a satisfying aerial combat loop in the Insect Glaive. But because all 14 weapon types are available from the beginning, personal discovery is always on the horizon. After a long grind with one weapon, nothing is stopping you from picking up another. You can go to the training room to practice with them or, if you’re feeling bolder, take a new weapon out into the world for practical use. Every weapon requires a different playstyle, though, and it’s never wrong to use what works best for you, focusing on discovering the rest of the game.If the game has a weakness, it’s the tutorial system. While not exclusive to the weapons, the game’s tutorial system is either one or two blocks of text, and the aforementioned do-it-yourself training room. It’s the absolute leanest cut of a tutorial possible, minimizing the amount of time between introducing you to a new concept and giving you free reign with it. The game is almost impatient about getting the player to the fun stuff, and while not malicious with this design like other third-person games, is still a bitter pill to swallow to truly commit to the game. It doesn’t teach you anything, but everything is accessible. Keep that in mind.Ah yes, the fighting-game style “here are your combos” excuse for a tutorial, how I loathe thee.After you commit to your weapon of choice, the combat is a great mixture of enjoyable and challenging. Pulling off some perfect combos gives its own feeling of pride, but at the same time you can take some pretty rough hits. The game is lethal, often pitting you against foes that look like they can eat you for breakfast, but the respawn time and mechanics between defeats are very forgiving. Tactics, which include learning your blade and using the land to your advantage, are important to master as you hunt more and more dangerous creatures. Laying man-made traps or using the environment to ensnare your target are essential skills to develop if you want to graduate from fighting blindly. Learning an enemy’s weak points will make your hunts go a lot easier. For example, the Rathian has a poison tail, but you can sever it with enough damage and neutralize the poison. So be sure to check the monster field guide that is made available to you. It provides plenty of helpful tips like that.When hunting, the first task is to pick up the trail of the target. The Scoutflies will be drawn to tracks and hover over them as they wait for you to investigate. You’ll be following footprints, scratch marks, mucus, feathers, or whatever else may be left behind by the particular monster. Keep in mind that other creatures will leave tracks to follow, so you need to pay close attention to make sure you’re tracking your target. Once you have tracked for long enough, the monster will appear on your map and you can go after them. Depending on the completion requirements, you’ll be told to slay, capture, or hunt the specified target. Slaying means killing the target, capturing entails trapping the target and putting them to sleep after weakening them, and you can satisfy the hunting requirement by either method. Killing a target allows you to carve materials from them while capturing them allows more research to be done and gives you other unique rewards. The materials you’re looking for may affect your future course of action.The day will come when Shock Traps don’t work, but that day isn’t today.In between fighting monsters, you’ll be at the base preparing for your next hunt. The base is pretty large and has plenty of locations to visit. You can go to the Canteen to eat meals that boost stats for the next quest, forge or upgrade equipment at the Smithy, buy equipment at the Armory, take on bounties or add investigations at the Resource Center, learn more about creatures you’ve encountered at the Research Center, grow materials at the Botanical Research Center garden, meld materials with Elder Melder after finding her with the Third Fleet, meet up with other hunters at the Gathering Hub, or just go to your room, where you can train or dispatch the Tailrider Safari. When you’re ready to go on quests, you can go to the quest board or your handler to accept them. There are 4 different types: assignments, optional quests, investigations, and events. You can begin loading the quest before everything else, though, so that once you’re ready, you are taken to the quest location.As another bitter pill to swallow, though, all of this is introduced with short one or two tutorial text boxes. Unfortunately, much of this information can go easily unnoticed; we’re still unsure how one of our reviewers unlocked Mandragora in his garden but his friend did not, and another friend missed Elder Melder entirely, missing out on charms, with online guides unhelpful as she had already relocated to Astera. This is exacerbated by the text-heavy nature of the game. Tutorials are blocks of text, and the interfaces to engage with options previously mentioned are presented almost as spreadsheets. Exploration through the wilds always gives you something to find, but through constant text boxes appearing, as monster tracks or materials become within reach, force you to rely on the minimap and space right above it rather than the whole field.There’s a lot of important things happening in this image and none of them is the fact I’m standing in a pile of rotten bones.The game is busy, and demands a considerable amount of attention to engage with all the text sprawling across the screen, though never exhausting in this way. In the same vein that the game skims over tutorials because it’s excited about the fun stuff, it’s almost throwing too much fun stuff at you at any given moment. Either you’re bombarded with text as you hunt down a monster, or you’re trying to translate a screen written in spreadsheet. Thankfully, the heavy text disappears during the important part: fighting monsters.The namesake creatures of the game are plentiful and unique: From Great Jagras, giant lizards depicted as the opening big beast that can swallow you whole, to the electrified Tobi-Kadachi, to the stunning Tzitzi-Ya-Ku, to the elegantly dangerous Legiana. The game is filled with monsters whose secrets you as a hunter need to uncover and conquer to truly become the alpha predator. You’ll memorize their names as you spend game sessions focusing on finally beating one instance of the Odogaron, or grinding out many Kulu-Ya-Ku. You’ll learn their attacks, their habits; what they like to do and where they sleep; and you’ll grow to respect each of them in their capacity as giant animals that live in these parts.Do you know how hard it is to get acceptable screen shots of monsters mid-combat?Now, another big draw to Monster Hunter: World is the multiplayer action. This allows multiple hunters to take on quests as a team instead of going solo. If one of these devastating beasts is giving you trouble taking on alone, gathering a team could help get the job done. After playing through a good chunk of quests with a group of fellow hunters, the differences are clear. Knowing there are partners that have your back makes the hunt more comforting. Don’t be fooled though, that doesn’t mean things will be easy. In a normal quest, you fail after fainting 3 times, but in a multiplayer quest, those 3 times are shared among the party. That means that the incentive to protect and help each other is even stronger, juggling who is engaging with the beast, who is setting up traps or health boosters, and who needs to hide to recover. Thankfully, you don’t need to have a group of friends ready in order to take on quests in a party; players can leave room for others to join them on their quests when they’ve been posted. It’s a bit clunky, and the way the game handles story missions only makes it feel clunkier in the opening hours, but this ensures that you won’t be left out of the multiplayer experience if you wish to try it out.Even though you have a job to do, that doesn’t mean you have to go straight for it and do nothing else. The hunts have time limits, but they are long enough to give you plenty of time to explore before taking down your quarry. On your way, you can harvest materials from the environment or even slay smaller monsters to get items. It provides enough freedom for players who also enjoy open world style games to draw more out of this release. If you want free reign to explore, expeditions are right up your alley. They allow you to wander around any chosen location for as long as you want. This is the perfect opportunity to load up on supplies and hunt to your heart’s content. For one of our reviewers, it was easy for him to lose himself in the land, distracted from whatever quest may be on hand at the time. For our other reviewer, not so much.The environments are beautiful in a way most AAA games should work to emulate, scrapping high-end realism in favor of stylistic and memorable setpieces. However, sometimes that’s hard to notice in Monster Hunter: World; exploration is a strong tone of the narrative, but you tend to play from your mini-map more often than engage in the visual grandeur or its impressive scale, monsters themselves set aside. Environmental traps and rare items make the world feel immersive, but by leading you to more tools to use, not by leading you to new places to see. The aesthetics of the Coral Highlands, for example, is prominent mostly because it’s an inescapable contrast from the rest of the game, with its vibrant pinks and blues. In contrast, the Rotten Vale, a zone defined by its unique grotesque nature, fails to excite discovery any more than the Wildspire Wastes. And by this point, the player has probably already committed a minimum 15 hours into the game, going back and forth between the hunt and the hub. Whatever visual novelty the Elder Recess holds will be lost to the visual sameness of most of the gameplay.To reiterate, though, the game is beautiful. I always stop to watch the sun set or the moon rise here.This is important because it highlights that Monster Hunter: World isn’t an open world game. As much as the narrative is written to be about discovery through the untamed wilds, the core engagement is too goal-oriented to truly nurture this playstyle. Whatever quest you embark on, you have one specific objective, and completing it means being booted out of the loaded instance, disrupting discovery. You can hunt other monsters during these quests, but only your target is locked in, unable to depart before the quest ends. If you run an expedition, any monster you come across can suddenly depart before you can finish hunting them. Not that running through a zone gives you time to think about alternate objectives as the UI is lit up with lines of text every step. To lose yourself in the environment is to fight against the constant stimuli and warnings the UI delivers, which our other reviewer couldn’t overcome.Monster Hunter: World is a Boss Rush game at its core, with miniature arenas and hallways connecting the encounters. The game does a poor job of getting you lost in the joy of discovery because it does such a great job engaging with everything else. There is always another quest, investigation, another hunt to go on, and there’s always a need to gather more supplies. There is always another weapon or armor set to grind for, always another hunting challenge to overcome. It’s filled to the brim with goal-oriented loops, but satisfying loops nonetheless. The last couple of paragraphs are critical of Monster Hunter: World despite this, because it’s easy for somebody new to the series to see everything that this game has to offer, from the weapon trees to the lush environments to the variety of monsters, even the title “World,” and convince themselves that this series is a quirky spin on the Skyrim type of open world game, and leave disappointed.Monster Hunter: World feels like it took the effort to compromise between the legacy veteran fans expect to return, and accessibility for newer players. The tutorials are the best example of this, being curt enough to jar players that have never experienced the series before but forgiving enough to make it easy to commit for the long-term. It teaches you nothing, but there is plenty of room for experimenting or trial and error, letting you learn at the pace you set for yourself. You have to learn to play by its rules and work past the bitter elements that can turn away newcomers, but it isn’t long before you can get the hang of things and enjoy becoming a true hunter.It may be a poor teacher with text-heavy interfaces, but Monster Hunter: World is a great entry into the franchise if you haven't played anything from the series thus far. It's polished and filled with content, and you'll regret not immersing yourself in the series sooner. It provides a challenging yet enjoyable combat system that will keep you on your toes, and the variety of menacing monsters adds new challenges and keeps things from getting dull. You’ll happily trade hours of your free time for more monsters to hunt, capture, and slay.—Calvin Neill TragerSee below for our list of partners and affiliates:One of the longest running independent gaming news, reviews and culture sites on the web.The thing that is magical about the Wizarding World isn’t the magic – it’s...by Ron BurkeThe world is going to end.

Monster Hunter World,Keza MacDonald,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/jan/30/monster-hunter-world-review-ps4-xbox-one-capcom,"PlayStation 4, Xbox One; CapcomPitting you against everything from fire-breathing dinosaurs to fluffy bird-wyverns, this is destined to be one of 2018’s best gamesIt’s rare that a video game forges a connection with nature, but Monster Hunter World does so by returning players to a time when humans were a part of the food chain, casting you simultaneously as a hunter-gatherer and zoologist. Like a virtual Attenborough, the hunter heads out into stupendously gorgeous places, rich with natural life and untouched by human influence, to track and observe extraordinary creatures, gathering local plants, bugs and mushrooms to study their healing or offensive properties. Then, distinctly unlike Attenborough, they must battle to the death.Monster Hunter’s foes range from fire-breathing dinosaurs to building-size elder dragons to fluffy bird-wyverns that look like a cross between a hamster and a bat. They are realised so convincingly, with such personality, that it’s easy to believe that they could be real creatures despite their fantastical appearance. Each of them exists within a natural hierarchy, feeding on smaller monsters and fleeing when larger ones appear in the middle of a fight. And beginners beware: they will feed on you, too, given half a chance.Monster Hunter is all about these setpiece battles, dodging out of the way of giant, crushing jaws and poisonous claws before rushing in to land a few hits with an improbably enormous sword, spear or axe. The combat is fluid, honed to perfection over this series’ 14-year history; each weapon creates a different play experience, from a glaive that has you leaping and spinning like a murderous pole-vaulter to a sword that converts into an axe and makes you feel like a prehistoric Transformer.What justifies the World part of the title is the organic familiarity that the player develops with the game’s ecosystem. Over time you become aware of exactly which plants and bugs are used to make restorative potions, where particular creatures nest and hunt, where to go to find wyvern eggs or fishing spots. At first you’ll consult maps, menus and friends for this information, but, by the end, you just know it. You feel like a part of the ecosystem.It would be a stretch to call Monster Hunter World accessible. Many of the monsters are as challenging to defeat as they are impressive to look at. Up to three fellow players can be brought in at any time to lend a hand in soul crushingly difficult fights, but the monsters are gifted with extra resilience to even the odds. And though the premise is simple, considerable time must be invested in understanding the intricacies of weapons, armour and hunting techniques.But, like your knowledge of the game’s beautiful and rich ecosystem, this knowledge accumulates naturally over time, and a game that seems intimidating at first quickly becomes one of the more rewarding gaming experiences of recent years. There is no feeling quite like taking down a dragon with nothing but a sword, your wits and sheer nerve.Already, just a few days after the game’s launch, a knowledgable and populous community has formed around it to offer advice, in-game help and cat memes, revealing the humour and playfulness that counterbalances Monster Hunter’s challenging nature. This game will be played all year. There is no better time to join in."
Monster Hunter World,Asher Madan,Windows Central,http://www.windowscentral.com/monster-hunter-world-xbox-one-review,"No offers foundWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.Monster Hunter: World is an expansive game which requires patience and skill to master. The title takes place in a semi-open world setting where you're tasked with understanding Elder Dragons, while also hunting down various other creatures. Elder Dragons are rare, elusive monsters that have lived since ancient times, and are able to bring about the destruction of entire ecosystems if they desire.The premise behind the game might be simple, but it tells a somewhat complex story. You're part of the Fifth Fleet in pursuit of a colossal Elder Dragon known as Zorah Magdaros. Once every decade, Elder Dragons trek across the sea to travel to a region known as the New World. This migration event is referred to as the Elder Crossing and has baffled the Guild for years. The Guild is the main governing body in the Monster Hunter universe, and they work alongside the Elder Dragon Observation to monitor and research particular species. To get to the bottom of this mysterious pattern, the Guild forms the Research Commission, dispatching them in large groups to the New World.The game begins as you're shipwrecked upon arrival to the New World after an attack by Zorah Magdaros. The main objective in Monster Hunter: World is simply to battle gigantic monsters in epic locations. As a hunter, you take on numerous quests to kill increasingly difficult beasts in their unique habitats. Depending on the region, like the Coral Highlands or Rotten Vale, you encounter different monsters which utilize their environment to their advantage.You never feel like you're battling mindless creatures.For example, due to the extreme nature of the Rotten Vale, the region is a breeding ground for resilient beasts. Being exposed to death and decay not only makes these creatures incredibly tough, but they also have a few tricks up their proverbial sleeves. A giant lizard-like monster coats its body with tar and then rolls around in the bones of the dead to gain thick armor. You'll have to get through that first to do some serious damage to the softer hide underneath.While the story revolves around acquiring contracts to hunt down monsters, the enemy variety the game presents is truly astounding. Just like previous entries in the franchise, Monster Hunter: World maintains the sense that the creatures are the stars of the show. Even if you come across a Kulu-Ya-Ku or Pukei-Pukei in the wild, you realize that they have distinct personalities. Unlike other games, you never feel like you're battling mindless creatures.A large part of the journey is discovering what playstyle suits your skill level. Whether you choose to equip a massive sword or a projectile weapon, mastering it takes time. For example, you may not like how an oversized hammer feels in comparison to the quick attacks of a bone sword. There are dozens of options, so determining what works for you is imperative to success. You can also craft, upgrade and purchase new items at any time.The poor weapon tutorials don't make it easy to pick and choose.Unfortunately, the weapon tutorials don't make it easy to pick and choose. The best way to learn about all the weapons is to try them out individually. There are numerous side quests which revolve around gathering resources or accomplishing some other minor task for a vendor back at camp. Testing out new loadouts works well during these scenarios. There's also an expedition option available but it's a little more unpredictable because you never know what creature you'll encounter during your journey.Gamers who take down monsters receive numerous materials that can be used to create stronger weapons and armor in order to hunt down even more dangerous monsters. This is the basic gameplay cycle Monster Hunter: World relies on to keep players engaged. Capcom has promised aggressive post-launch support which will add new monsters and other challenges for experienced players. If they deliver on this task, the game might keep you coming back for more.Monster Hunter: World will keep you coming back for more.Even if you choose to forgo the side quests, we estimate that it should take you around forty to fifty hours to complete the main campaign. However, that seems like the beginning of one's journey in Monster Hunter: World because there are so many items to craft, foes to vanquish, and research to conduct.While we tested out the game mostly in the single-player environment, Monster Hunter: World allows you to team up with your friends to carry out various missions. Playing with game in online co-op isn't necessary but it does make it significantly easier when you're fighting flying creatures which require different types of attacks to take down, not to mention monsters the size of buildings.Monster Hunter: World allows you to tackle missions in co-op mode.One of the most unique features is the ability to send up an S.O.S. Flare when you foresee failure. This allows other gamers to join your party and help you take down a particular creature. This is a standard ability in many games when you're stuck at a boss, and it's definitely a welcome addition to Monster Hunter: World given the intense encounters you have on every mission.Monster Hunter: World features in-depth customization options which allow you to tailor your character and feline companion. It's great to generate a hunter that looks somewhat like you. This process allows for deeper immersion because you feel like a part of the game.Deep character tools allow you to create figures like Geralt of Rivia.If you take the time to experiment with the character creation tools, you can even character famous figures like Geralt of Rivia from The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. There are a lot of options here but it'll take you some time to become familiar with them.Monster Hunter: World on Xbox One X features a number of graphical modes. The options available are ""Prioritize Resolution"", ""Prioritize Framerate"", and ""Prioritize Graphics"". As expected, Prioritize Resolution renders the game close to or at 4K, so it appears incredibly clear. Prioritize Framerate adjusts the visuals so that it targets 60 FPS as closely as possible. Lastly, Prioritize Graphics enhances the shadows and other effects instead of simply rendering them with more pixels. Out of all of these options, Prioritize Resolution seems to be the best because not only does the game look great on modern displays, but it also has the most stable performance. Unfortunately, there are problems associated with all of these settings.From our playthrough on Xbox One X, it appears as though the frame rate is erratic on all three options. This means that even when Prioritize Resolution is selected, the frame rate doesn't stay locked at 30 FPS. There's also noticeable judder at times due to frame pacing issues. However, this is by far the most stable the game gets because Prioritize Framerate and Prioritize Graphics feel less optimized.We recommend playing the game on Prioritize Resolution.While Prioritize Framerate targets 60 FPS, it feels as though it rarely hits that figure. While the movement and combat is noticeably smoother, it's still not ideal because Monster Hunter: World requires timed attacks and copious amount of dodging. Prioritize Graphics is a little better but it still feels off.Prioritize Graphics mostly adds more foliage and lighting but it still appears to suffer from strange frame rate anomalies. It's unclear what the exact nature of the problem is, but Capcom should've included a 30 FPS lock in the game because it would've helped eliminate the uneven frame times. Hopefully the developer will add that option in the coming weeks. Almost every other game out there gives players the option to lock the frame rate at 30 FPS, so it's unclear how such a significant oversight took place to begin with. For that reason, we would recommend playing the game on Prioritize Resolution because it offers the smoothest experience, providing you're playing on an Xbox One X.Even though there are a lot of great aspects to Monster Hunter: World, there are a few issues which need to be discussed. Most of these problems stem from the dialogues and technical elements of the title. Issues like poor lip-syncing are jarring to witness as they occur so frequently.Without giving away too much of the plot, the explorers in Monster Hunter: World claim that they aren't against nature and are only here to observe. Monsters are supposedly a part of the ecosystem. However, most of the quests revolve around killing them — even the most gargantuan of beasts — so there's a noticeable dichotomy between the story and actions. While this isn't a game-breaking flaw, it does make you question if the story and gameplay teams communicated well with each other during the development cycle. Eliminating or simply rewording some of the dialogues would've easily solved this problem.Most of Monster Hunter: World's problems stem from the technical aspects of the game.Monster Hunter: World has a steep learning curve if you haven't played past entries in the franchise. The combat is difficult to master but it never comes across as a daunting task. Unfortunately, the upgrade system is what many gamers will struggle to comprehend. There are just so many options that it can feel overwhelming.Just like the weapon tutorials, upgrade tutorials don't do a great job of explaining the mechanics. While bettering armor is easy, the different weapon skill trees are hard to decipher. Even after playing the game on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 for hours, we struggled with the system until we researched previous games in the Monster Hunter franchise. Various websites and YouTube videos do a better job of explaining how Monster Hunter: World works than Capcom.Beyond the lip-syncing issues on Western versions of the game, some of the voice acting just isn't that good because there is a lot of forced delivery. While the lip-syncing issue probably couldn't have been avoided given the target audience of Monster Hunter: World, greater quality control should've been exercised when recording dialogues. Luckily, even with all of these issues, the game stands strong due to its rewarding gameplay, and mostly intriguing story.Overall, Monster Hunter: World is a great game which runs best on Xbox One X. The Monster Hunter franchise started off on the PlayStation 2 in 2004, but then became a Nintendo exclusive for many years. Titles like Monster Hunter Tri, Monster Hunter 4, and even Monster Hunter Generations were only available on systems like the Nintendo Wii or Nintendo 3DS.It's great to see that the franchise makes a triumphant debut on Microsoft's machine because many gamers expressed concerns about optimization and other issues before launch. If you like challenging experiences along the lines of Dark Souls, be sure to give Monster Hunter: World a go. The game will keep you engaged for dozens of hours because it takes patience more than anything to become a legendary hunter.Monster Hunter: World went on sale for Xbox One and PlayStation 4 on January 26, 2018, starting at $59.99.

Monster Hunter World,Tom Hoggins,Telegraph,http://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/reviews/monster-hunter-world-review-thrilling-eccentric-deliciously/,"Early on in Monster Hunter: World, Capcom’s deliciously complex action-RPG digs its hooks in with a heart-pounding epiphany.After prowling World’s opening area for a good eight hours, I have been foraging mushrooms, harvesting goodies and, of course, slaying many a beast within the lush green thickets of the Ancient Forest. Even the bulbous, poison-tongued Pukei-Pukei has fallen to my oversized sword. Throughout my pilgrimage is the constant menace of the Anjanath, a fire-breathing, winged T-Rex thundering through the trees.For the new hunter, the Anjanath is a terrifying introduction to World, triggering the instinct to flee every time you hear its ear-splitting roar. So it is natural to be apprehensive when the call comes to take the beast down. Because come on: how can I possibly compete with this toothy lord of the jungle?The realisation comes as you are mounted on the Anjanath’s back, raining shuddering blows down on its thick, feathered spine. You are ready for this, bolstered by weaponry carved from gathered materials and the confidence of experience.A few dozen hours later and you can down two Anjas before breakfast, but in the moment it is a tough, delirious 20-minute brawl spanning across the map as you trade blows with the berzerking creature. Retreating when necessary, pursuing when the Anjanath makes a run for it. Luring it into vines and smacking it in the throat to stem the breath of fire. Landing the final blow is a rush of exhilaration, relief and, maybe, just a bit of guilt. It is a magnificent creature, after all, and is only the beginning. Hell, Anjanath isn’t even the apex predator of the Ancient Forest, let alone the New World.This is the thing that makes Monster Hunter: World such a fabulous video game. The compelling loop of escalation, anticipation and constant improvement excites from the very beginning: there is always better gear to craft and there is always a bigger beast to beat.And there are none bigger than Zorah Magdaros, the Elder Dragon MacGuffin of Monster Hunter: World. The ‘Scorching Mountain Dragon’, as it is fittingly known in English, is rolling through the Great Ravine in the New World, intentions unknown and disturbing the ecology of the surrounding areas. The Commission, a ragtag bunch of hunters, scholars and explorers of which you are a member, has travelled to the area to research and manage the local flora and fauna while trying to figure out what Zorah Magdaros is up to.So you venture out from your home base of Astera to different areas of the new world, each with their own distinct aesthetic and ecosystem, completing tasks for the Commission such as culling a certain number of beasts, tracking down some of the more impactful creatures or simply gathering ingredients for the botanists and chefs back home.World’s myriad areas are stunningly realised and wildly diverse. From the bubbling swamps and bright looming sandstone of the Wildspire Wastes to the haunting decay of Rotten Vale, each locale gives a markedly different feel each time you step foot on their uneven ground.Visually, this is an artistic team at the top of its game, set free by more powerful hardware. Monster Hunter has traditionally been a series built for handheld, with all the restrictions that entails. But restriction can often breed invention, so to see that expertly combined with the technology of the latest home consoles is as gorgeous and arresting as you could hope for. The Coral Highlands, in particular, is a work of fantastical brilliance; transporting the vivid colours and textural diversity of the deep sea to a sprawling, vertiginous cliffside.It isn’t just for show either, the soft, blue webbing that weaves itself between coral rocks is bouncy and pliable. If you are standing on that when the rat-faced Paolumu slams into it, then you’re going flying. Or maybe you can trick it into getting its head jammed in the centre for a few free whacks. If you are in the Wildspire Wastes, the last thing you want to do is let angry mud serpent Jyuratodos skim beneath the surface of the swamp.Learning and utilising each terrain becomes a key part of combat, adapting to your surrounding as much as to the particular monster you are fighting. Each area has its own distinct ecosystem, with predators hunting herbivores and more powerful monsters scrapping with each other in turf wars (another thing you can use to your advantage). The bestiary itself is a wonderfully weird motley crew; from fearsome, muscular dinosaurs and dragons to quirky, but no less dangerous, animalistic mash-ups.In a sense, Monster Hunter: World is a simple game at heart. Travel to terrifically realised environments, battle a diverse set of monsters in thrilling combat and use the materials you earn to craft more powerful weapons to take on more powerful monsters. A compelling enough proposition in its own right, but it is the layers of complexity that elevate the game to exceptional.The Monster Hunter series has long had a reputation of being a contorted sprawl, delighting its long-term fans but newcomers often bouncing off its thick exterior like a blunt axe off a Barroth’s hide. And, full disclosure, I have traditionally been one of the latter.Much has been made of World’s play for the mainstream, with the game apparently streamlining and curtailing its more convoluted aspects. And while that is true to an extent, this is still a tough, complex and unashamedly eccentric adventure. The difference in Monster Hunter: World is that its on-ramp is a lot faster and smoother, the game explaining its intricacies with detailed tutorials and letting you get to the good stuff almost immediately.Take your arsenal, with a vast array of weapons to choose from and learn. You now have a training ground to help you decide your hunting tool of choice and practice their combinations; slow, hulking hammers, speedier blades, ranged bowguns. Or, my personal favourite, a shield and sword that can combine into an electrically charged axe.All have their own style and upgrade tree and each is as detailed as the last. You might decide to stick with melee weapons throughout, for example, not even being aware of the entire section dedicated to modifying bows and crafting different ammunition. The weaponry is distinctly different in tactics and move-sets and discovering your rhythm is one Monster Hunter’s greatest thrills.That it takes World less time to get there is to the game’s credit, which squares away many of the series more archaic habits. No longer are you sent out on a collection of fetch quests before you begin hunting in earnest, with the plentiful gathering tasks accepted on the fly and baked into your expeditions. There are a vast number of missions that can fill up your hunting diary, but World does a splendid job of folding the complexities into the game as you progress.New quests and elements, from special items and stat-modifying charms, are fed in at a brisk rate. It’s quick enough to keep things fresh but dispersed sparingly enough to ensure you have a suitable understanding of your existing techniques and equipment. And in the field, more modern tweaks make the action more welcoming for newcomers and smoother for experts. You can whizz through your bulging item pouch with a customisable radial wheel and glugging a potion no longer has you rooted to the spot. The once arcane controls have also been shuffled so that anyone familiar with a third-person action game can quickly adapt.One of the more obvious new features to quicken the Monster Hunter pace are the scoutflies, a bright green swarm of bugs that guide you to monsters and flutter over to other points of interest. While an insect GPS might seem trite, even the scoutflies need their own attention to perform effectively. You will track monsters by following footprints, dung trails and other telltale signs with the scoutflies initially bouncing between tracks rather than taking you straight to your quarry. The more you track a particular beast, the more effective the scoutflies will be at finding their target.Giving the navigation system its own upgrade tree and personality is so very Monster Hunter. What can initially seem like a slightly belligerent guide begins to make sense, playing into the game’s slavish dedication to lore. The more you and the ecology team back at Astera research a particular monster, the more detailed your monster guide becomes. Each page can give you essential tips on each creature’s strengths and weaknesses, or rival monsters you might be able to lure into a scrap.There is a startling amount of information on offer, which is very carefully thought out and presented with flair. Coupled with each monster’s unique behaviour in the field, the cumulative effect is one of surprising believability. No small feat in Monster Hunter’s quirky and fantastical world.Some old habits die hard, of course, and new players should not go in expecting an easy path. Some aspects of the game are so absurdly detailed it can take patience to understand, the map icons can be arcane and tricky to follow, while even some of the language used in menus can be a little muddled.The achievement of Monster Hunter: World, however, is that by the time these more archaic foibles become an issue you will already be in too deep. Any issues melt away as you leap whooping from your seat, punching the air after you slay a giant beast while on your last sliver of health. In Monster Hunter: World, those heart-pounding epiphanies happen with thrilling regularity."
Monster Hunter World,Zachary Atwood,Gaming Nexus,https://www.gamingnexus.com/Article/5760/Monster-Hunter-World/,"I think it’s important to preface this review with a disclaimer: Historically, I am not a Monster Hunter guy. Monster Hunter as a series has a long and storied history dating back to 2004, and I’ve been playing Monster Hunter games for almost none of it. Much like a large portion of the Monster Hunter: World player base, this entry in the series was my first foray into the world of Monster Hunter. Now, there are a lot of really passionate Monster Hunter fans out there, and I think it’s important to understand beforehand that my review of this game is from the perspective of a complete and utter Monster Hunter noob.Now that we’ve cleared that up, I’m going to take a minute to talk about what Monster Hunter is at its core. As its name may suggest, the game revolves heavily around hunting monsters. Players take on the role of a hunter tasked with researching and hunting monsters in a variety of environments. While there are story justifications for the hunts, the central gameplay loop (and most interesting mechanic) is using the parts harvested from slayed monsters to craft better weapons and armor. The game ramps this up excellently, starting you out on easier smaller monsters and building up to the bigger ones. As you progress through the different monsters, they get tougher and tougher, sometimes requiring you to farm previous monsters to improve your gear.The game’s greatest feature is the pure amount of variety it brings to the table. Every monster is unique and has completely different attributes and behaviors. For example, one of the first large monster hunts you do in the game is the Great Jagras. The Great Jagras is basically a giant lizard, and as you do more damage to it, it will go and find a smaller monster to eat, expanding it’s stomach and completely changing it’s moveset. New hunts bring new flavors to every fight, and force the player to evaluate the situation and adapt to an evolving enemy.Another source of variety in the game are the weapons. There are 14 different weapons in Monster Hunter: World, and each one is like playing a completely different game. Every weapon has a unique focus and specific combos, so each one requires the player to learn it and understand how to maximize its effectiveness in a fight. My weapon of choice for my playthrough was the insect glaive. The insect glaive is focused on mobility and evasion, which is among my favorite playstyles in any game. It’s main combo allows the player to launch into the air and keep damaging the monster while staying airborne. The other facet of the weapon is the ‘insect’ part. The glaive comes with a bug called a Kinsect that can be commanded to attack a monster. Based on the part of the monster the Kinsect hits, it gains a buff which can be returned to the glaive. Once the glaive has all three buffs, all of it’s combos are enhanced and it starts pumping out even more damage. On PC, I opted to stick with the insect glaive the entire time to really master the weapon, but I’d previously tried the longsword, greatsword, and switch axe when I played the console version. It’s really fun taking the time to learn and master new weapons, and it brings more diversity to the game. In terms of story building, the game splits into two distinct sections. It’s hard to put an exact hour count on it, but the first ‘half’ of the game took me about 25 hours. During this part, the player is introduced to a lot of monsters as they track and hunt an elder dragon: Zorah Magdaros. This part of the game is actually called Low Rank, but you don’t really know that until you progress into the second ‘half’ of the game, which is High Rank. After you enter High Rank, you’ll be fighting against a lot of the original monsters, but they’ll be much tougher and their core mechanics will have adapted. Slaying or capturing monsters in High Rank yields better materials, allowing players to craft even better (and cooler looking) armor and weapons. As you progress through High Rank, you’ll go up against some of the toughest monsters in the game, the Elder Dragons.In terms of my own experience, I put about 15 more hours in after hitting High Rank and feel like I barely scratched the surface. There is so much more to do and the increased difficulty requires  a little more grinding to make sure your loot is up to snuff. I consider myself a collector type in games, and Monster Hunter definitely scratched that itch for me, as I found myself hunting monsters repeatedly just to grind enough resources to craft their entire armor set. Lastly, even with all the time I put into the game, I’m looking forward to diving back in just to try out all the different weapons. This game seems to just keep on going and going, and in this case it’s a good thing, as I really never felt myself wanting new content.Given that this review is specifically for the PC port, I’ll take some time to talk about how it performed on PC. My PC runs on an AMD Ryzen 1700, 16GB RAM, and a GTX 1080. I didn’t see any performance issues directly impacting my frame rate, but initially the game was really taxing my GPU, which I think caused a few crashes. I modified a few settings which seemed to fix this. Primarily, I turned off the environmental fog, both because it helped performance and because I felt like the game looked better without it.One of the biggest failings of the PC version is the controls. When I first loaded the game I tried to play with keyboard and mouse, but I quickly had to switch back to a controller because the controls are so poorly implemented. Camera panning is constrained, so trying to turn too fast makes the game feel really unresponsive. Some of the mappings from controller to kb+m aren’t even complete, so actions like accessing your hotbar aren’t even possible from the get go. This wasn’t a dealbreaker for me, as the game still feels great on controller, but if you’re really against using controller you may want to hold off until Capcom delivers a patch to improve the keybinds.The final frustration with the PC version was the multiplayer connectivity. I understand the game is very popular and probably experienced an incredible amount of traffic in the weeks since release, but most of my attempts at co-op hunts with friends resulted in random disconnects mid-hunt, which really sucked the fun out of the game. Capcom has acknowledged all three of these issues and are working through patches to improve the experience, so hopefully it’s just a waiting game to see these improvements come through.When it comes to Monster Hunter, the level of depth in the game leaves a lot to talk about, and I don't think it's possible to capture everything in this review. I personally think this entry in the series is a fantastic addition, both for returning fans and new players like myself. The game is a tremendous amount of fun, balancing challenge and reward perfectly in a way that made me want to keep on hunting for hours on end. The PC port itself has some technical issues which detract from the overall experience, but the quality of the game underneath more than makes up for it.When it comes to Monster Hunter, the level of depth in the game leaves a lot to talk about, and I don’t think it’s possible to capture everything in this review.

Monster Hunter World,Jackson Bostian,COGconnected,http://cogconnected.com/review/monster-hunter-world-pc-review/,"I have a confession: Monster Hunter: World is the first game I’ve played from the series. Fortunately, the game has been advertised as a good starting point to those who are new to the series, so I decided to poke in my nose and see what exactly this game is that caused so much stir in the industry earlier this year. Monster Hunter: World originally burst onto the scene back in January with its console release. A massive success, the game sold extremely well, becoming both Capcom’s and the PlayStation 4’s bestselling game. The game gained massive acclaim for allowing you and your friends to join forces in mercilessly destroying the delicate ecosystem that houses these beautiful animals, but until now you couldn’t do it with the satisfying clickety-clack of a mechanical keyboard. Yes, PC gamers have had to wait more than six months for the release of a port. At long last, the wait has ended, and the hunt begins.Well, it does, and it doesn’t. Players are still going to have to sit through a ton of tutorials and the establishment of the story. This process is long and rather boring and highlights Capcom’s long-running trouble with storytelling. The result was me spamming the poor A-button on my controller until the three hours of text-based tutorials subsided. In short, the beginning is lackluster and slow and led to a lot of “Just let me play!” being shouted at my screen. Fortunately, after the three-hour mark, the experience improves dramatically.“Finally,” I thought, “I’ve got my weapons, I’ve got my cat dude, and it’s time to hunt some monsters!” And so I did. I ran around murdering everything that I suspected may have a pulse and sliced it up. Funny thing is, I didn’t realize another player had shown up in my game and had gone to actually complete the mission. What this means is that I finished my first mission without actually completing the task. I had previously heard about the prominence of online cooperative play, and I had felt that it was great that cooperation was being included, but this was the first step toward my feeling that the online play is intrusive and a burdensome on the rest of the game. I know that you can turn off a lot of the online aspects, meaning you don’t have to actually play with others if you don’t want to, but you can still feel the effects of the design decisions made to accommodate such a prominent feature. I was going to complain about how the time limit on hunts was an unnecessary feature that discouraged exploration, but then I realized that it likely serves to encourage multiplayer parties to actually work together and focus on the mission. I was going to complain about the inability to save while on expeditions and missions, but then I realized that it was probably because of the multiplayer aspect. I was going to complain about being automatically sent back to base sixty seconds after completing a mission, but then I realized that it’s another decision that’s probably meant to help with multiplayer functionality. The very worst aspects of the game for someone playing predominantly single-player are those design decisions meant to bolster the multiplayer. They’re forgivable issues, but still frustrating to the guy who wants to make a solo career of slaying monsters.Speaking of careers, let’s look at our career monster-hunter protagonist’s journey. Or we could not. The story is stylistically awesome, but it may not be worth thinking about it too hard. It’s not really the focus of the game either. The focus is where it should be: Hunting big scaly beasties.After learning to maneuver the game’s twisted intricacies, Monster Hunter: World is really quite fun. It looks fantastic and has a great sense of style, and it’s a game about hunting giant freaking monsters. What more do you want? The combat itself is interesting. For the uninitiated, a group in which I was firmly positioned prior to my time with the game, the combat is clunky and slow. Savagely spamming the quick-attack button with no regard for what’s going on around you will get you killed. These monsters are, after all, monstrous. Trying to tank blows during a frontal assault is about as likely to succeed as actually trying to rush a dinosaur. Instead, the player should think more technically, as Capcom seems to have looked to its Street Fighter roots for influence. The result is a complex combat system with innumerable combos ranging from basic slashes to flamboyantly deadly twirling, and all of these combos work slightly differently with each member of the game’s large weapons catalog. This combat system is what took me from wishing I had a fast-paced Dinosaur Dark Souls game (don’t get me wrong, I still want that) to seeing and appreciating the special spirit behind Monster Hunter: World. The game exudes the soul of Capcom. The same soul you can feel in games like Resident Evil 4. That soul that sometimes means having a poor user interface, shoddily written stories, and misguided game design, but also means that the game is probably going to feel really good once you’ve “got it.” Admittedly, I haven’t “got it” with Monster Hunter: World yet, at least, not really. My gameplay is still clunky and rough, but the times when I do land my combos tell me all I need to know about what I’m working toward. The learning curve feels steep as Mt. Everest at times, but when you think about why people climb Mt. Everest, it all makes perfect sense.So, do we judge the game by its sale’s figures? Is Monster Hunter: World the best game Capcom has ever made? I don’t think so. What it is though, is a damn good time. In the event that you find yourself in possession of both a powerful desktop and $60 that just can’t wait to spend, give it a shot. For all its flaws, Monster Hunter: World is proof that a game can be more than the sum of its parts.*** A PC code was provided by the publisher ***Developer: CapcomPublisher: Capcom"
Monster Hunter World,Ashleigh Macro,Tech Advisor,https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/games/monster-hunter-world-review-new-vs-experienced-players-3670973/,"When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence.As the experience is so different for new and experienced players, it’s only right to deliver two verdicts – one from Ashleigh and one from Lewis.
For experienced players: I am going to spend hundreds of hours playing this game and I can’t wait. It has everything I could want from a Monster Hunter release and more, taking away some of the annoying an unnecessary stuff while it’s at it. I have always felt that console is where Monster Hunter truly belongs, just look at the graphics, the interaction between monsters, the intricate maps, and of course the screen estate. The one downside is not being able to bring it to work with me to play on my lunch break and on the commute, but I’m more than happy to sacrifice sleep to make up for it. I award it Five Stars. 
For new players: I’m not saying that Monster Hunter: World is a bad game – it’s far from it. It’s just a little bit overwhelming for newbies, especially when it comes to learning about the various systems and mechanics at play. Once you get used to the game, you start to see the charm that has generated the series’ cult-esque following. It’s satisfying and rewarding seeing the changes in your weaponry and armour as you upgrade, and the variety of monsters mean that no two battles will be the same. Just be prepared to put the time in, because it’s not a casual game that you can pick up and play for 20 minutes at a time. I award it Four Stars. It’s been a long time since I was as excited about an 
upcoming game release as I have been about 
Monster Hunter: World. I already know that I will be sinking hundreds of hours into this game, and I cannot wait.But here’s the thing: I’m, at a stretch, a Monster Hunter veteran. I’ve been playing it for years and years on PSP and then on 3DS. This is the first time it’s globally made its way onto consoles, and the first time I’ve felt as though there’s been a real effort to make it appeal to the masses in the UK and the US (it is enormous in Japan).While I absolutely love Monster Hunter games, I have no idea how it’s going to go down with those new to the franchise. It’s one of the most complex games I’ve ever played, with 14 weapon types to master, hundreds and hundreds of items to learn the uses of, huge numbers of weapons and armour to craft with varying strengths, weaknesses and elements, and that’s just the tip of the iceberg. It’s taken me years to learn it all, and I’m still far from an expert at it.Plus, Monster Hunter: World, despite its name, isn’t an open world game. Instead, you have timed quests that take place in various different maps. You’ll be limited to very basic quests to begin with, in order to help you get the items you’ll need to upgrade your first weapons and armour sets. Quests get progressively more difficult as you upgrade your equipment and learn new skills, until you find yourself fighting weird and wonderful monsters so tough they’ll kill you in one hit even with the strongest of armour.To make this review as well-rounded as possible, we decided to get a total Monster Hunter newbie (Games Editor 
Lewis Painter) to play too. That way, whether you’re new to the game or not, you should get an idea about whether or not you’re going to enjoy it. We’ve combined our star ratings for a final rating, but carry on reading to find out our (differing) opinions and split verdicts. (We’ve not mentioned multiplayer much as we haven’t had a chance to use it pre-launch, but we’ll use it over the weekend and will update this early next week!).Oh, and if you’re struggling, take a look at our top 
Monster Hunter: World tips and tricks. Also check out the new 
Monster Hunter World Iceborne expansion.Monster Hunter: World is due to be released in the UK (and the rest of the world) tomorrow, 25 January 2018, for 
PS4 and 
Xbox One, and can be picked up from the likes of 
Amazon and 
GAME. The game is also due to be released on PC, but that isn’t due out until Autumn 2018.As mentioned above, the experience between those that know the franchise and those trying it for the first time are quite different, and to help illustrate this, we’ve split the review into two – one for 
experienced players (by Ashleigh), and one for 
new players (by Lewis).There’s a lot about Monster Hunter: World that will feel familiar to long-standing players, but everything feels as though it’s been kicked up a notch. The power of the console means there are no more loading screens between areas – you’ll be able to roam the maps freely. That does also mean there’s no more escaping into another area to heal and sharpen, though.The maps are more complex than before, too. They’re layered this time around, and feature various camps that you’ll need to discover that act as fast travel points when travelling to and from the area for Quests. This is especially handy if you already know where the monster will be, as you can cut down the amount of time spent tracking. Gathering points and other areas of interest are now marked on your map as you discover them, too, providing an invaluable resource when on quests and expeditions.You can have cats, or Palicos, as they’re officially named, cook you a meal from the camp itself before each quest, bringing a range of ability boosts that stay with you for the entire quest, or until you faint. You’re now able to switch weapons mid-quest too, as long as you prepare your storage box properly first.All 14 weapons from Monster Hunter Generations are still available, though there are some notable changes. There are too many to run through completely, but for me, the best change is that your Kinsect is treated separately from the Glaive with the Insect Glaive weapons. This means that you can upgrade your Kinsect safe in the knowledge that you can switch it between weapons when necessary.Another change is the removal of Hunter Arts, which I must admit I’m pleased about because I found them to be an unnecessarily complex. Instead, there are plenty of weapon-specific combos, which you can master in training areas or as you progress through the quests themselves.Something else I love about Monster Hunter: World is that single and multiplayer quests are now a single entity. You can team up with up with three other players on every quest in the game, rather than having to treat the single player quests differently to those that contribute to your Hunter Rank in multiplayer mode.Plus, if you’re struggling to take down a particularly challenging beast on your own, you can send for help (without ending the quest) using the new SOS feature. Simply fire a flare and all other Hunters in your online session will be notified of your request.You can also play private games with just those you invite, or with players from around the world. I have a big group of friends that all play Monster Hunter, so we tend to play in private groups of four, taking it in turns to choose a quest that could help us get items need for weapons and armour.Another thing that’s new and incredibly helpful is the Wishlist feature. In previous games, I’d have a notebook with weapon trees and armour sets scrawled in it, trying desperately to keep track of items I needed and how many I already had. Now, with the wishlist feature, that’s all taken care of for you, so you can spend more time actually gathering the items rather than trying to work out which you need.In the previous Monster Hunter game on 3DS (Monster Hunter Generations), there was a Prowler mode that let you play quests as your Palico. That’s gone in Monster Hunter: World, but the felines can still join you on your quests to provide backup when there aren’t four people in your party.We’ve got this far and haven’t even mentioned the monsters! Their improvements are the most exciting, I think. In addition to there being some cool-looking new monsters to fight and learn about, there’s also much more interaction between monsters. The beauty of the open world nature of the game means that it’s possible that two monsters will bump into each other randomly and fight to the death. This completely changes the dynamic of the battle (to your advantage OR disadvantage) and provides an epic view if nothing else.You shouldn’t worry too much about time either – if you’ve not got long left of your quest and haven’t quite finished killing the monster you need to when a new, even more exciting monster appears, you can continue killing the original monster to end the quest then choose to stay in the area to kill the monster that appeared. This new feature is called Expedition mode and can be accessed whenever not in a quest.While the game is welcoming for long-time fans of the series, those (like me, Lewis Painter) that are fresh to the series may struggle – especially when it comes to learning the ropes. That’s because Monster Hunter: World is massive and complex; it uses mechanics and systems from previous games along with new features, and assumes you have knowledge of how these systems work before you jump into the game.  That’s not to say that there aren’t any tutorials though. The first hour of the game is essentially a tutorial, introducing you to the concept of the game and the most important areas in your camp.The issue is that it doesn’t really address combat – one of the biggest parts of the game, and arguably one of the most complex. There are 14 types of weapon, each with upgrade trees and a range of different abilities and effects, and you’re left to hack at barrels in a training area with minimal combat prompts to find out how to best utilise each weapon. C’mon Capcom, if it’s a training area, at least let me train against something remotely like what I’ll be facing in the wild!For example, there’s a cool weapon called a Switch Axe that switches between an axe and a sword with some kind of special ammo (despite firing no bullets) – it looks cool and I imagine it could do a fair bit of damage, but I couldn’t tell you how best to use it or what the ammo is used for because the game assumes I already know.The assumption of prior knowledge is the game’s biggest downfall, but if you’re dedicated and up for learning the intricate systems at play, you’ll be rewarded with the freedom to take on Monsters however you like.That’s the upside to complex systems – the game is incredibly versatile in terms of gameplay. You can hide in bushes and use crossbows to deal damage from afar, go all-in close-range with a longsword or act a little more defensive with a sword and shield combo. You can focus your armour on melee defence or specialise in elemental protection – you can even tweak your Palico’s loadout to compliment your play style.The combat button mappings are somewhat confusing too, especially if you’re used to the standard R1/R2 combo for light and heavy attacks.Firstly, the button combinations depend on the weapon you’re using, and secondly, R2 is usually reserved for a special move that requires some powering up – not good for those that revert to bashing R2 out of habit.It’s not the only questionable choice either – tapping either R1 or Square during combat will put your weapon away, something that would happen to me constantly when trying to recall the complex weapon combos from the training area. These two buttons are, in most other games, used for combat, and muscle memory means I’ve put my weapon away on more than one occasion and started sharpening my blade while directly in front of a monster. It’s frustrating while you’re learning and takes some time to get used to.While Quests are the aim of the game, I’ve come to prefer going on Expeditions during my time in Monster Hunter: World. I find that the time limit on Quests – though hidden by default – to add unnecessary pressure to a task that is already fairly difficult, and although the time is usually more than enough, I’d prefer being able to go at my leisure.And that’s why Expeditions are great; you can explore the different biomes you come across with no limit on time or deaths, and you’re free to explore, scavenge and take on Monsters at your heart’s content. The only difference is that unlike with completed quests, you won’t receive any special rewards on return to camp.A huge part of the game is multiplayer gameplay, where online players can join you on expeditions, give you backup when taking on Quest monsters and more. The issue is that there aren’t many people online right now, so we can’t really try it out. I’ll be playing this weekend with others, so I’ll update this next week with more information.Essentially, if you’re a newcomer, expect to put some serious hours into Monster Hunter: World and be up for learning the ins and outs of the games intricate systems and mechanics. It’s not a casual game that you can jump into for 20 minutes either, as most Monsters will take longer than that to kill – and that’s not including time taken to track them down! There’s definitely enough bang for its buck to be appealing, but we just wish that there was a little more hand-holding in the first couple of hours while you’re still learning – and that’s not something I thought I’d ever say about a game.PhonesLaptopsTabletsWearable TechHome TechSecurityDigital Magazine - SubscribeNewsletters"

Monster Hunter World,Michael Chow,COGconnected,http://cogconnected.com/review/monster-hunter-world-review/,"Monster Hunter: World is the latest title in the long-running Monster Hunter franchise and is the first mainline title to hit non-Nintendo consoles since Monster Hunter Freedom Unite on the PSP in 2008. This title also marks the first Monster Hunter to release simultaneously in North America, Europe, and Japan, also allowing for cross-region play. With a passionate fanbase and now the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One (and PC later this year) markets available, Monster Hunter: World has the opportunity to be a mainstream hit.The narrative of the game is quite simple, though story is obviously not the main component of the Monster Hunter franchise. You play as a Hunter of the Fifth Fleet in pursuit of Zorah Magdaros, a colossal elder dragon heading to the New World as part of the Elder Crossing. As part of the Research Commission, discovering more about the New World as well as the Elder Crossing phenomenon is the primary objective. One could consider the New World to be a metaphor for the franchise’s journey to mainstream gaming.Like previous Monster Hunters, Monster Hunter: World is an action role-playing game with a focus on hunting monsters, equipment progression, and skill-based combat. There are fourteen weapon types such as the Long Sword and Hammer, each of which is uniquely useful as players hunt and capture monsters, and use their parts to craft better gear. Players also receive various quests and assignments that have alternative objectives such as gathering mushrooms. As players progress through the story, the monsters get stronger and thus the progression of equipment is a vital component of the gameplay. While having better equipment is important, player skill and, to a greater extent, player knowledge is vital to besting the game’s tougher monsters.As for the actual hunting, players begin at a base camp and search for tracks or other clues to track monsters in one of five regions with the aid of Scoutflies. These regions are seamlessly connected without loading screens between areas, while online multiplayer lets players call in friendly assistance mid-quest. The multiplayer portion can be a bit frustrating to set up but playing with friends is a great experience. When playing either alone or with just one other, players can opt to bring their Palico (cat sidekick) along for the quest.Monster Hunter: World takes everything the series does well and arguably does it better. Part of this is due to the improved capabilities of the hardware it now runs on, as well as quality of life changes that make the game much more accessible to new players. Various improvements and new features such as the aforementioned Scoutflies, mantles, the slinger, and interactive wildlife only help to improve the experience. Even taking all those creature comforts into account, the different mechanics at play and overcrowded inventory system make Monster Hunter: World seem overwhelming at first. Thankfully, time and experience will help alleviate this feeling.The core of the game just feels good. The movement and combat are smooth and precise but punish arrogance and greedy play with a quick death. Most of all it’s satisfying to see a solid plan come together and take out a particularly nasty monster, both on your own and in a group.________________________“Monster Hunter: World takes everything the series does well and arguably does it better.”Freed from the confines of the Nintendo 3DS, the series has never looked better than in Monster Hunter: World. The game is vibrant and runs well, and even more so on the PS4 Pro and the Xbox One X. With a variety of settings, colors, and visual cues, Monster Hunter: World is truly a sight to behold. The vistas are striking, the characters uniquely stylized, and obviously the monsters are top notch. Much like the inventory and new features, the user interface of Monster Hunter: World is relatively crowded, with a lot of information provided to players at most times.While Capcom has done an excellent job in improving accessibility for Monster Hunter: World, the game may still be tough to get into for new players with so many mechanics and features being presented at once. For fans of the series and those dedicated to learning the game, Monster Hunter: World is an experience that can last players for a long time. With strong gameplay, a decent narrative, and a great aesthetic, Monster Hunter: World is one of the best entries in a series now accessible to many more players.*** A PS4 review code was provided by the publisher *** Developer: CapcomPublisher: Capcom"
Monster Hunter World,Kai Powell,Wccftech,https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-world-hd-hunter-simulator/,"Ever since the surprise unveiling of Capcom’s new monstrous IP on the PlayStation 2, I’ve been a fan of the Monster Hunter series. In its original iteration, Monster Hunter was an RPG that disregarded conventional levels and instead relied solely upon the player’s skills and the gear they’ve crafted from various monster parts. In over a dozen years, the series has stayed true to that core concept while constantly adding in bigger and more badass monsters in each iteration. For most of those years, Monster Hunter’s main games have been limited to a handheld audience, given the climate of Japan’s gaming community (with notable exceptions including a port to WiiU among others). During last year’s E3, Capcom surprised and amazed fans with an HD title that brought Monster Hunter onto the most powerful consoles ever released, with a PC release to follow. Has Capcom stayed true to the formula with Monster Hunter World, or is this a completely new beast?As a newly recruited hunter of the fifth fleet, the player is thrust into a world of towering beasts and behemoths, each more gargantuan and terrifying than the last. There’s an ever-changing ecosystem to the world that’s brought about by the sudden appearance of an elder dragon, the towering, building-sized wyverns that round out every Monster Hunter’s story. Monster Hunter World thankfully doesn’t feature any underwater biomes, but each region is filled with unique flora and fauna and mark the homes of different monsters that routinely need to be culled for the safety of the hunter/gatherer village the player calls home. While Monster Hunter World places a greater emphasis on its story than previous iterations, the core progression still remains the same. Story missions are all separated into their own brief mission and typically involve either gathering certain materials or slaying/capturing a notable monster. This doesn’t stray far from previous games, but Capcom’s cutscene development has really outdone themselves with monster introductions and action scenes that are rendered in-engine with the player’s current gear and setup. Story missions are technically only playable once as they are Assigned to the player; once completed, these are relegated to Optional missions that still offer similar bounties. Monster Hunter World also features a bevy of randomly generated missions known as Investigations that ensure players always have hunts for their favorite prey. In Low Rank, these don’t offer much deviation aside from the number and variety of monsters to face, whether they need to be captured or slain, and certain numerical values such as time allowed or number of times the player can faint. Capcom has taken some inspiration from mobile games to get players engaged and coming back day after day, even offering daily login bonuses (which, for me, typically consisted of monster dung and a voucher to double one mission’s gold gains).Consider the first thirty or forty hours of Monster Hunter World to be the training wheels. Newcomers will certainly get their money’s worth out of the low rank hunts all leading up to the repelling of Monster Hunter World’s gigantic elder dragon, Zorah Magdaros. However, don’t consider the journey to be anywhere close to complete once you claw your way out of Low Rank. Hitting High Rank (somewhere around Hunter Rank 12) opens up the world to all manners of monster invasions, arena fights, and gear customization.Prior to hitting High Rank, my initial impressions were that Monster Hunter was streamlined far more than I would’ve anticipated. Blademaster/Gunner segregated armor sets are merged into a single set with most abilities favoring the blade, although Free Element has been merged together with Ammo Up as one example. Once in High Rank, the gear opens up more with every set offering two variants: one with a predetermined amount of skills and the other offering a couple of less skills but also gem slots to slot in your own skills. Armor set bonuses are also a new addition, functioning just like you would expect from most modern MMORPG’s (equip a number of pieces from the set to gain new latent abilities). Monster Hunter World has been the first core MH title to get me out of my comfort zone and explore a brand new weapon. Previously, I was a hammer/hunting horn main, opting for that satisfying overhead smash to crack open a Quropeco’s beak, or upgrading to the Charge Blade in its first appearance in Monster Hunter 4. For monsters that needed something a bit sharper, the longsword was my weapon of choice. These weapons feel quite close to their previous iterations, but it was the new changes to the bow that caught my eye the most. Finally being able to play on a console with proper analog sticks and having the comfort of aiming freely gave the bow some changes that make it far more enjoyable than the few missions I dabbled with it in Monster Hunter Generations. Featuring the mobility to strafe around a brute wyvern and target their soft weak points or unleash a shotgun-like quick shot at close range, the bow is a technical marvel that feels utterly satisfying in every fight. Nothing is more satisfying than bringing a monster to its knees with a volley of paralysis shots and then finishing the combo with a fully charged dragon piercer, the bow’s signature move that pierces through the monster, causing damage every step of the way. Against the Diablos, a staple of Monster Hunter games known for its hulking size and charging into the player with its dual horns, a well placed Dragon Piercer easily dealt close to two hundred damage, outclassing most other weapons in a single attack. If I was fast enough on the draw, I could nail two or three of these shots before Diablos would get up, only to have parts broken off or get stunned all over again.Gone are the fragmented zones that kept previous installment’s environments feeling like miniature arenas. Monster Hunter World feels just like its namesake, with loading screens and getting knocked into an adjacent area by a poorly timed monster charge being relics of the past. The change to having a much larger connected environment helps World feel way more alive and adds a great sense of scale to the adventure, such as when you’re tracking down a Great Jagras only to have a Bazelgeuse invade from the sky and mess up everyone’s day (which has happened on more than one occasion in High Rank).The seamless environments are only one of the many changes that monster Hunter World has brought into the core formula to adjust it for a newer audience on more powerful hardware. Paintballs are gone, replaced by tracking down monsters by gathering footprints or fluid samples. There’s a persistent progression to these minor tasks, as the hunter will learn more about specific monsters and be able to track them outright in addition to track their weaknesses and material drops in the hunter’s guide. And if you played anything that didn’t require ammo, dulling your weapon’s edge and running out of whetstones was a common worry (especially if you’re like me and forget to restock the essentials before every hunt); never fear, whetstones are now infinite use and don’t even take up an inventory slot. They’re merely part of the standard hunter set, in addition to a basic BBQ spit, fishing pole, and capture net for the player’s Slinger.Monster Hunter World’s PlayStation 4 release is optimized for the PlayStation 4 Pro if you own one, offering options to prioritize framerate, graphics, or resolution. Despite playing it on a 4K television, I stuck with framerate for that smoother experience. In most instances, Monster Hunter World held stable but two items in particular would cause a noticeable slowdown (but still certainly playable): the Torch Pod and Health Booster. Particle effects in general seem to tax Capcom’s engine in particular, so it might be best to lay off the fireworks when you’re playing online, at least until Capcom patches in some stability enhancements.Capcom’s first full-fledged Monster Hunter on the latest generation of consoles (with PC to follow later this year) is among one of the strongest sequels to any RPG I’ve ever played. Nearly every quality of life improvement works out in World’s favor and makes the experience more immersive and accessible, rather than trying to dumb it down for a newer audience (I certainly won’t miss trying to knock out a Fatalis with an orange sharpness hammer just because I was an idiot that didn’t bring enough Whetstones). We’re only just in the first month of 2018 and already I can claim that Monster Hunter World might very well be my own personal Game of the Year.Reviewed on PlayStation 4 Pro (code provided by the publisher). You can purchase the game on Amazon.As the first debut on new platforms, Monster Hunter World displays excellence in every hunt. The new changes are a great evolution of the series that can get new players their first taste of hunting while veteran players will look forward to seeing an old nemesis in High Rank hunts.Subscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox© 2023 WCCF TECH INC.

Monster Hunter World,Glen Fox,Push Square,http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/monster_hunter_world,"GuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpMonster Hunter: World2018 8.3Game RatingUser Ratings: 95Our Review: Scroll DownA whole new worldVersion Reviewed: PS4 Pro / EuropeanMonster Hunter: World is a departure for the franchise – and we're not just talking the new location. This is the first main entry to launch away from Nintendo since 2006, when Monster Hunter 2 found its feet on the PlayStation 2. It's a bit of a leap going from the technologically limited platforms of Nintendo to the PlayStation 4 and PS4 Pro, but it's a jump that Capcom has handled with aplomb.Monster Hunter: World fully takes advantage of the current-gen hardware's features, with stunning visuals, 4K and HDR support, a world that's far more open than ever before, and vastly improved online features. The monsters and wildlife themselves are also a technical marvel, with their own daily habits. The whole world just teems with life.But for all that the game pushes the franchise forward, some old habits come back to haunt it. Capcom is still yet to get the tutorial and general learning curve right, and that's probably the most crucial issue here. It's likely that this will be many's first Monster Hunter, and you're basically just shoved into the deep end following a all-too-brief tutorial.In fact, it's very feasible that even 20 hours into the experience, entire systems will still elude you. You'll have moments when a non-playable character asks you to do something and you won't even know where to start. Part of the fun here is in figuring everything out, sure, but good luck trying to capture a monster without assistance.But before we dig any further into that, let's remind you what Monster Hunter is. This is a social Japanese role-playing game that puts grinding at the forefront. As the name suggests, your primary goal is to hunt monsters, craft gear from their remains, and hunt even more powerful monsters. Rinse and repeat.Contrary to how it sounds, it's far from dull or repetitive. That's all credit to the combat system and the feeling you get when you first conquer a large monster. In fact, often the first thing you want to do afterwards is defeat it all over again, just because you can. That feeling is reinforced when you visit the smithy. Fresh upgrades for your weapon and a brand new armour set are your rewards, and you can't get everything you need just defeating it once.Combat is very similar to other action role-playing titles like Dark Souls - at least, once you take away the target system. You can target enemies here, but all this does is keep them in your line of vision. It won't make it easier to hit them, but that's the main bulk of the challenge. Each monster has vulnerable parts, which can break if you hit them hard enough, and so combat becomes a dance of dodging and hitting them where it hurts when the opportunity arises.There are 14 different weapon types to use and each of them changes the experience drastically. Think of any Japanese RPG archetype and you can find a way to play as it here. You've got massive great swords and hammers that hit as hard as they are slow, and nippy daggers and short swords that keep the damage numbers flowing. You can play it like a third person shooter with bows and bowguns, or even a rhythm action game with the horn.It's arguably the most diverse set of weapons in any modern RPG, with each weapon so different from the last – some even provide entirely new ways to play. You can either stick to your favourite or craft a bunch of weapons for different purposes. That's probably the best way to experience the game, and the same applies for armour. This is where the compulsion to keep killing comes back into play.This core loop has kept the franchise going strong for many years, but Monster Hunter: World is still unlike any that have come before. The world is far more open; it's made up of a bunch of different areas, each of which is completely unique in terms of visuals. What's more, once you're in an area, you can kiss goodbye to loading screens.Each area is generally bigger than before as well, so it's a good thing that Capcom has provided a few means of getting around faster. You've got a grappling hook that speeds up climbing walls and vines, and you can swing from it in specific areas to leap across chasms. You'll find vines you can swing from too, and you can slide down mountains, or fast travel to a different camp if you're feeling impatient.There are new options in combat as well. Take the slinger, for example, which you can use to fling a variety of different pods at enemies. You can use it against flying enemies to bring them to ground, or against large monsters for varying different effects. The different pod types are very diverse.You've also got scoutflies that highlight nearby items and help you track monsters, a Palico partner that fights alongside you, sets traps, and heals you, and specialised tools like a ghillie suit to use as camouflage or a glider that you can use to, well, glide.Another new addition is a full-blown plot. Capcom has toyed with the idea before, but it's never felt as fully fleshed out as this one. You play as a member of the fifth fleet, a talented group of hunters who are travelling to the aptly titled new world to try and figure out why the elder dragons periodically make their way over here in an event known as the elder crossing.Before you've even set foot on the new world, you'll face your first elder dragon, Zorah Magdoros, and the remainder of the plot involves hunting it. It's a fun story, and one which helps guide you between each area. You even learn more about the monsters you're hunting, which is a nice touch. The characters you meet are pretty likeable too, if largely stock and shallow. The storytelling doesn't stand up against the likes of The Witcher 3, but it does breathe extra life into this rich world, and encourages you to keep going.Monster Hunter has always been a franchise designed around multiplayer, and that's an area in which the move to PS4 has arguably improved it most. You're always online and can post quests that others can join, or fire an SOS flare mid quest if you need support. In many ways, it negates the use of the gathering hub entirely. Previously, you'd go here to request support, and you can still do that, but you just don't want to. We imagine it will exist solely for showing off gear and messing around with friends.That's if you stick with it long enough, though. For all that Monster Hunter: World is absolutely gorgeous – seriously, this is no doubt the best the franchise has ever looked, with a wide variety of imaginative environments that look stunning in 4K – it still feels a little inaccessible.If you haven't played a Monster Hunter before, you'll need a hefty beginner's guide to get you up to speed. There's just so many systems to learn that it feels overwhelming at first. You can learn most of them on the go, and that's a huge part of the charm, but there are some that could really have done with a tutorial.Monster Hunter: World is easily the finest entry in the franchise to date. The move to PS4 has only done it favours, with stunning visuals and environments that you'll want to get lost in. Flashy, satisfying combat will lead to many water cooler chats, and vastly improved online features make it a breeze to find help. It's a real shame that Capcom still hasn't found an ideal way to welcome new players, but if you are able to sink your teeth into World, you'll discover an incredible action RPG experience.Please note that some external links on this page are affiliate links, which means if you click them and make a purchase we may receive a small percentage of the sale.

I always have to stay connected?I'll probably get this once I'm finished/bored with AC Origins, which tbh doesn't look like being any time soon.Ahh gutted. Wanted to be here day 1 but I’m halfway through botw. Hopefully the clan gets set up and stays active longer than the destiny 2 one did! Can’t wait to jump in.MT Framework is so gorgeous! dunno why Capcom don't use it more oftenCan't wait!Both DBFighterZ and MH World have finished downloading! 15 hours left...This will be my first real Monster Hunter game. I played the PSP game for like an hour so that doesn't really count.@FoxyGlen Can the game be played offline? I would like to complete the main campaign before jumping into the multiplayer.It's been a while since I've been this excited for a new release.@Nickolaidas if your internet goes down (or isn't connected) it will load in offline mode. The default is online though, and I haven't found a way to go choose offline mode.@Fight_Teza_Fight you can play offline but it defaults to online. You can just ignore most of the online features though, and post all quests for just 1 player. It's kind of like Dark Souls though, in that the online features do add to the experience. This game is getting rave reviews and I'm going all in. Played a bit of Tri years ago on the original Wii, never stuck with it but had some enjoyment. This time I'm going to actually give it a fair chance.On a side note, Capcom has quietly gotten on a nice roll here. Resident Evil VII was brilliant, the Street Fighter V Arcade Edition update has turned that game around and now Monster Hunter has returned to PlayStation and Xbox in style. First time since 08-09 that it seems like Capcom is really delivering, hopefully it gets rewarded with great sales on this.@FoxyGlen my main concern was that if you had to be always online, the game immediately has an expiration date tied to its servers' longevity (ala destiny). Glad to know this isn't the case.Hype! can't wait to play it Ps. I don't like playing multiplayer game (beside diablo 3 with friend and journey), but playing monhun beta multiplayer is really fun, I really recomend people to try the multiplayer if they're having problem with strong monster.@Nickolaidas There's single player mode, internet connection is not needed if you want to play single player only.@Gamer83 hope remake2 will deliver as well.''and you're basically just shoved into the deep end following a all-too-brief tutorial.''Good! I hate games with lengthy and boring tutorials! It's been a while since I played a MH game, I never got far into it, but this time I plan to take my time and learn the ins and outs of the game.@NickolaidasHopefully. In the meantime, PlayStation fans get a new, epic MH game for the first time in quite a while. Thrilled about that. I was hearing from friends who played the beta that the game is great, looks like they weren't wrong. Really hyped for Friday so I can actually talk about the game and my experiences as a relative newbie to the franchise.@FoxyGlen That's great, thanks for answering. Really looking forward to finally sinking my teeth into Monster Hunter!@FoxyGlen Formating of text at the beginning is broken.I couldn't get into MH on the 3DS, and by the sounds of it I won't on the PS4 either, which is surprising considering the previews and news suggested it was better for non-experienced MH players.Maybe when the backlog clears I'll give this a shot, but not anytime soon.Can't wait to get stuck in myself! Great review, Glen.How are the camera and controls? I struggled a bit with Tri on the Wii once I got to the harder fights after the story. It was so tanky (and I was a bit crap). Haven't played a Monster Hunter since. Is it more user friendly these days? Does the far superior PS4 controller make a difference?This is great.welcome to ps4 monster Hunter world .word up sonEnjoyed the betas to bits so I‘m absolutely hyped about getting this tomorrow. Won‘t be able to play until Saturday, though.Very nice review.  This hit on all the information I was wondering about.  Sounds really good, but my plate is full atm, so I’m waiting.@zazzy : well said.ten outta ten! ten outta ten! ten outta ten! ten outta ten!Souls games don't get tutorials, but that's a pass. A major part of the appeal to MH is learning the game and how to succeed.Nice review! Only thing that's missing is talking more about monster variety!Anyway I'm only waiting for midnight so the game unlocks I hope this game sells well. I’m definitely picking this up. I enjoyed playing MH on the Nintendo consoles over the last few years.Anyone in the UK looking for someone new to play with, feel free to add. I am friendly easy going guy looking to hunt some monsters. PSN is SaitamaOPM89. Thanks!Rave reviews everywhere... Goodbye ps2 era polygonal engine.There goes my weekend. I'm so happy to have MH back on a big screen. The Wii U version was pretty decent. But I could never get really into it on 3DS, even though the online functionality was impressive for the little hardware.I wish it came out today since I'm off work...A short tutorial sounds great. I loathed the long boring ""find 10 honey"" ""Gather 20 bitterbug"" etc fetch quests that doubled as the tutorial in earlier games. I believe that's what turned a lot of people off of MH early. 2 to 3 hours of fetch quests?! What were you thinking Capcom? Anyway, now the tutorial area where you can practice using weapons and items to your hearts content should take care of that drawback. I can't wait for tomorrow!@zazzy Some of the snobbiest vets anywhere can be found in MH games unfortunately. Faint once and they boot you out of a room. Blow up a bomb too early they boot you out of a room. Kill the monster in 10 minutes instead of 8? That's right they'll boot the whole team. Thankfully there are more helpful people than not. In my experience anyway. I still boot up MH3U just to help new players rank up.It's the first time that I will play a Monster Hunter game, I already pre-ordered it. I'm not a multiplayer guy, so I will stick with the single-player mode, hope it's a great experience as well.I see it is getting great reviews but I am not sold. Played the beta with friends but I don't enjoy the combat. Maybe I should try more weapons to see if I can find something I like.@PS_Nation I urge you to at least try the multiplayer. I'm a huge single-player fan but there is just something amazing about hunting with friends.I never planned to play Monster Hunter Tri multiplayer but once I did I was hooked.@PS_Nation I don't play MH games with strangers either. I only plan to play the MP with my close friends.The problem with strangers is if you get someone far stronger than you, you'll get carried through content and struggle in the long term. It's better to only play with people in the same skill/gear level. Not an easy task.Will wait on this one as I am still working on Assassin's Creed Origins and next month Secret of Mana comes out as well as Bayonetta 1 and 2 which I am sure those will keep me busy for awhile.I'll be looking forward to this in August for PC, I have a lot of friends interested who have never played a monster hunter game before and are looking for a challenge.I'm probably the only one here who'll be playing this on Xbox because my friend game shares with me and he got it thereAnd like a lot of people this will be my first MH game played the beta on PS4 really liked itI enjoyed the beta considering it was my first go at a Monster Hunter game but not enough to get any time soon.Have way too much to get on with so I'll buy in a sale at some point.Happy for the rest of you though @FoxyGlen What are the time limits for quests? I found it to be a bit of a bugbear in the beta?@mookysam I've never had a problem using the camera on the 3DS because the L button can be used to control the camera instead of the on-screen D-pad. On the 3DS, it was set by default that if you pressed L once, the camera would look at the monster, but not lock onto it forever, and if you double-tapped L, the camera would face in the direction that your character is facing. I changed this to Type 2, which simply switches the L tapping functions. So thoughout Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate and 4 Ultimate, I mainly used the L button for the camera, but also just used the on-screen D-pad when it seemed convenient. You could also re-position and re-size the on-screen D-pad, so I set it closer to the face buttons for comfort.In the World beta, they now have the camera set to Camera Lock by default, which works like Camera Lock usually does in other third-person games involving swords and whatever, where you have the camera always looking at your enemy. I found that this limits the camera freedom that MH had before, but there is the option to change the way the camera behaves in MH World, so you can change it to be Target Cam like in the previous games, where you press L1 to quickly look at the monster, but you are still free to move the camera with the right stick. I find that this works best for me because I can look at the monster whenever I lose track of it, but I can still control the camera as I run around because I'm not always right next to the monster. Using the analog stick instead of the touchscreen is also more natural, so using a controller now is a welcome addition. Camera Lock also seems disorienting at times if you are fighting something tall-ish. And when I'm running around a monster in a circle, I press L/L1 quickly to constantly look at the monster as I run, so you can also simulate Camera Lock with the Target Cam setting.So while you can free cam the game by just using the right stick, I would recommend you do a combination of free cam and Target Cam for the best control of the camera.I praise the Target Cam because I feel that it would work well in other games too. For example, I've been playing Bloodborne for the past year or so, but I haven't beat it yet because I decided to try and Platinum it, so I'm doing Chalice Dungeon runs, which are like side-quest fights (idk) that are separate from the main story. There is one boss that I cannot beat because I have trouble using the camera while fighting it. It's called the Bloodletting beast and it looks like a large dog without a head. During the second half of the fight, a large worm thing comes out of its neck, which increases the beast's attack range. Anyways, during this fight, I've tried to fight it using lock on, but it's fought in a small cave, so if I get pushed near a wall, the camera derps out. I've fought it without using the camera lock (free cam), and while I did progress, I still needed the camera lock at times because I needed to focus on the beast. Standing under the beast is how many people fight it because he can't really hurt you when you are there, but camera lock messes up, causing the camera to look up in various directions. Free cam doesn't help if you constantly have to adjust the camera manually. So, here is a case in a non-MH game where a Target Cam system would work wonders.But anyways, yeah, hail Target Cam! I hope you enjoy MH World, if you get it.@adf86 Time limits are 50 minutes. I can't remember if there were ever any other quests that had a different time limit.The SixthAxis gave it 10/10 they pretty good with reviews as well pumped for this game. not that 8/10 is bad anywayBest rated MH on metacritic ever so far. Loved the beta - launch finally here.Hype intensifiesReally looking forward to getting this eventually, but currently playing through Ni No Kuni and Breath of the Wild, so I'll be waiting for a sale.Wooo, can't wait to pick up a copy after work. If anyone needs a hunting buddy, add smo5000. I also have a PS Community going called The Wycademy if anyone wants to join.First time I've played an MH game. It felt 'old'. I wasn't impressed with the backgrounds, world, or monsters in general.I'd rather have a SOTC remake.Been playing it for about 15 or more hours nonstop now. It's great. There's always one more thing to do and the world is so detailed and fun to explore.I've never played Monster Hunter before, and while there is a learning curve (of which I expected with any new IP), this game has surpassed my expectations. This game might be a rinse and repeat, but the depth and flexibility in gear/skills, monsters, and weapons makes this game the most fun I've had in a long time. 9/10 for meGood open world, interesting concept, vast choice of weapon crafting. BUT this slow, badly design game play function, ruining all the fun. all you get is frustration, because control is absolutely great. I mean, I can battle and move so much better and faster. This game needs lots of work to be done to become playable. Developers need to learn from Horizon Zero Dawn, which has perfectly designed and developed game play. I say don't but, wait 6 more months and see if the developer realize and fix all that.@Batista Please watch the language, thanks.

Monster Hunter World,Eric Hauter,Gaming Nexus,https://www.gamingnexus.com/Article/5587/Monster-Hunter-World/,"My son and I are hunkered down on a small incline above a heavily armored Barroth, eyeing it warily and discussing our game plan.“He does this crazy thing where he rolls in the mud. You have to watch for it. It makes his armor stronger,” he warns.“Okay,” I say. “Same drill as usual. I’ll tank with my blades and try to hold his attention while you do ranged. Try not to get too close, so you don’t get drawn in and start taking damage. Be ready to fight when I disengage to heal, if the Palico doesn’t keep up with the bugs.”“You know you can summon the Palico with the bugs, right?” he asks. “You don’t have to wait for him to just show up.”This is news to me. I quickly cycle through my items until I find the prompt that allows me to whistle for my little cat friend to rush to my side and squish a healing bug on my back. “Well, that’s awesome. Thanks!”“All right,” my son says, “let’s do it.” He fires off the first shot, startling the quiet monster. I dash into battle, immediately slashing and hacking at the hapless creature before he has time to react.It does not go well. The Barroth immediately turns on me, and I’m too old and slow to dodge out of the way before the mammoth creature sends me flying across the swamp with a vicious headbutt. The Barroth turns on my son and charges, kicking up muddy water behind him as he rages towards the irritating speck that is offensively plinking away at him with an ineffective gun.“Ahh!” my son cries. “Help!”“I’m coming!” I yell, as the jolt of impact wears off and I regain my senses. I dash back towards the battle, where I see that Barroth is busy stomping my son into the mud. One minute into the battle, and it looks like we are already done.Suddenly, from seemingly out of nowhere, a new figure appears on a small mesa that is sticking out of the mud. He is dressed in armor that is clearly far beyond anything we have been able to afford or build. Without a word, this figure jumps onto the back of the Barroth and begins plunging his oversized sword into the hapless creature’s back.My son and I let out a collective cheer.“Check this dude out!” I say. “He’s riding the monster!”“He’s like a superhero!” my son replies.The Barroth cries out and bucks wildly, trying to shake the mystery man off and stop the carnage. But the guy has a tight grip, and he doubles down his attack, mercilessly hacking away at the unfortunate creature.My son and I lunge back into the fray, the tide of the battle now clearly swayed in our favor. In a matter of minutes, it is over. The Barroth lays half submerged in the mud, defeated and still. The mystery man gives a wave and disappears again as quickly as he came.My son and I move to start looting the Barroth corpse as quickly as we can, laughing the entire time about the crazy thing that just happened.“Oh my God,” my first-person-shooter-fan son gasps. “I would have never played this game. It’s just not the sort of thing I would have tried. But it is awesome!” Put all of your reservations aside. Monster Hunter: World is one of the most engaging games I have played in years. I came to World as a Monster Hunter neophyte. I’ve attempted to engage with the Monster Hunter franchise twice in the past, and in both cases the impenetrable systems caused me to bounce off the game like a rubber ball. Why did I have so many weapon choices? Why did I have to eat food every time I went out into the field to hunt? Why did I need all this honey? What was with that weird cat?With Monster Hunter: World, it all finally clicked for me. I don’t need to use every weapon, I just need to find one that I like and play with it until I want to try something new. The food adds stat boosts which help me in battle and make everything go much more smoothly. The honey converts my potions into stronger versions of themselves, which makes it crazy useful. And that weird cat is my “Palico.” I have named him Simon Muggets, and he is awesome. I have constructed many fancy hats for him.I’ve often heard that to really engage with Monster Hunter, one needs to have an experienced friend introduce them to complexities of its intricate systems. A spirit guide, of sorts, who will explain exactly what is going on, and help a new player become acclimated to this storied franchise. I am happy to report that in the case of Monster Hunter World, players will be able to jump in feet first, and explore the systems at their leisure until they are comfortable.Yes, Monster Hunter: World is deep, with systems nested within systems. However, these systems are rolled out to the player at such a natural and measured pace that the increase in complexity is almost imperceptible. It is also possible to completely ignore many of the systems when they are introduced until you are ready to engage with them. When you finally do, you will likely realize how neatly these systems snap into place with the rest of the game, and wonder why you waited so long. The bottom line is that Monster Hunter: World is accessible to the point where I feel like the franchise’s older titles (the ones that bewildered me so badly) have now clicked into focus for me. I get it now. I finally get it.The most important thing that I have taken away from my time with Monster Hunter: World is that it is okay to relax. This is actually a very forgiving game. Nothing bad will happen if you mess up. If you fail a quest, you can just try again. If you miss collecting some resources, they will always be there later for you to grab. Don’t like your weapon? Grab a new one. Don’t like the modifications you made to your new weapon? Roll them back. Having trouble with a particular monster? Fire off a flare, call in the community for help. The rewards in are plentiful, and even failed missions are rewarding, in that you walk away with greater knowledge about the monster that just took you down.The storyline is interesting, but inconsequential. Basically, player characters are hunters that have recently arrived in the “New World.” They are tasked with a series of missions: to research and hunt down various monsters that are plaguing the efforts to settle this wild new land. Before long, side quests start appearing, allowing players to learn about the flora and fauna in the New World, and how creatures and plants can be used to help on their monster hunting quests. The story serves primarily as a gate, slowly unlocking features and expanding the map in a way that doesn’t overwhelm the player.This world is crawling with life, and everything in it serves a purpose. Plants and bugs can be harvested for potions and ammo crafting. Smaller, seemingly unimportant creatures can be captured and kept as pets in the player’s in-game home. Larger creatures can be harvested for food and leather. And of course, the monsters themselves can be looted for material to construct weapons and armor.What is incredible is how all of this comes together. Each monster is unique, and their behavior is an interesting mix of lifelike reaction to stimuli and scripted moments. The world is amazingly alive, so unexpected interactions occur with mind-blowing frequency. I've hunted the same monster six times, and none of those times were exactly alike. In battles that can last up to a half hour, there is a lot of opportunity for things to change players’ carefully calculated plans. Often times, other monsters cross paths with your battle, and everything shifts. Sometimes they join you in attacking the creature you are fighting, but they are just as likely to turn on you, and you find yourself suddenly in waters that are way over your head. To say that the battles are dynamic is a massive understatement.While Monster Hunter: World is a fantastic game, there is one area that might have players new to franchise scratching their heads. While there is a strong multiplayer component, new players should understand that there is a unique system that takes some time to get used to. In many ways it plays like a single player game, but with multiplayer components. Either way, don’t expect to play through the story together with friends, at least not in the traditional, Destiny-style manner.When the player enters the game, they have the option to enter someone else’s instance, or create one of their own. Each instance of the game can contain up to 16 players. While you are in game with 16 others, you do not see them in your home base/mission hub. Rather, you and these 16 players can drop into each other’s missions, up to four at a time. Players can only drop into story missions they have already defeated.In the example I used at the beginning, I started the quest to take down the Barroth. My son, who had already beat the mission, was able to drop in to help me. Then the third, high-level player saw in the quest UI that we were on the mission and decided to drop in to help us for fun.This quest structure created a dynamic where my son and I were playing through the game in tandem, chatting happily in a party about where we were, what we were doing, and discoveries we were making. When one of us got too far ahead of the other, we would dip back to help the other catch up. While not traditional, this made for a unique and engaging multiplayer experience. It is important to note, however, that initially finding your friends in the game and linking up to play can be difficult. I had some trouble getting into a game the first time with my son. Once we had played together, we were able to link up easily for further play, but the initial setup was fairly complicated, involving the entering of an alphanumeric code in order to sync our games. This dynamic struck me as needlessly clunky, given the strong social networks already in place on today's consoles.When choosing to enter a quest, players are given a couple of options. They can start one of their own quests, moving the story forward, or taking on a specific hunt for crafting materials. They can drop into someone else’s already-in-progress quest, which is great for hunting down creatures that you need for your new armor (or just to play superhero for some lower-level players). They can also answer an SOS flare, which is a cry for help from another player that might have gotten in over their head.There is also a social hub built into the home base, where players can gather to hang out and play some minigames. This area also houses an arena where two-player teams can attempt to take down monsters with predetermined gear sets. Doing so gains players materials for higher end gear. I can envision a certain subset of players grinding this arena to no end.Monster Hunter: World is amazingly beautiful, and as the game revealed new areas, I was astounded by the ingenuity of the level and monster design. Secrets abound, and each hunting ground feels like its own fully realized environment. The development team clearly spent a lot of time polishing Monster Hunter, and never once did I experience anything that could be described as a “bug.” The feeling of immersion was never broken by any technical issues, which for a game this complex, is really saying something. It is also worth noting, in this day and age, that there is no sign of anything even vaguely resembling a loot box anywhere in this game. Monster Hunter, with all its looting and material gathering, seems like it would be ripe for this sort of exploitation. So, hats off to Capcom for making the decision to avoid gouging their loyal fanbase.There is frankly too much to say about Monster Hunter: World for one review. The scope and depth are astounding, and I feel comfortable admitting that I will be playing regularly for at least a year, maybe more. With a game this large, I would never try to convince readers that I have seen it all, rather, the fact that I feel like I have barely scratched the surface should indicate how sprawling this amazing world really is.I have greatly enjoyed my time with Monster Hunter: World. I can easily see it becoming my new World of Warcraft, my new Overwatch, my new Fallout. After the limited amount of time that I have had to spend with it, I happily place it in the top tier of games I have ever played. It is that rich. It is that deep. It is that good. Put all of your reservations aside.Monster Hunter World is a fascinating and beautiful game. MMO fans, action fans, RPG fans, and open world fans will all find something to love. This is a game that invites players in and gradually reveals its glorious depths. The unconventional multiplayer aspect might take some time to get used to, but the core loop of hunting monsters and crafting gear is so strong that even the most skeptical players will be snared by Monster Hunter’s hooks if they give it half a chance.* The product in this article was sent to us by the developer/company.Howdy.  My name is Eric Hauter, and I am a dad with a ton of kids.  During my non-existent spare time, I like to play a wide variety of games, including JRPGs, strategy and action games (with the occasional trip into the black hole of MMOs). I am intrigued by the prospect of cloud gaming, and am often found poking around the cloud various platforms looking for fun and interesting stories.  I was an early adopter of PSVR (I had one delivered on release day), and I’ve enjoyed trying out the variety of games that have released since day one. I've since added an Oculus Quest 2 to my headset collection.  I’m intrigued by the possibilities presented by VR multi-player, and I try almost every multi-player game that gets released.
My first system was a Commodore 64, and I’ve owned countless systems since then.  I was a manager at a toy store for the release of PS1, PS2, N64 and Dreamcast, so my nostalgia that era of gaming runs pretty deep.  Currently, I play on Xbox Series X, PS5, PS4, PSVR, Quest 2, Switch, Luna, GeForce Now, (RIP Stadia) and a super sweet gaming PC built by John Yan.  While I lean towards Sony products, I don’t have any brand loyalty, and am perfectly willing to play game on other systems.
When I’m not playing games or wrangling my gaggle of children, I enjoy watching horror movies and doing all the other geeky activities one might expect. I also co-host Spielberg Chronologically, where we review every Spielberg film in order, which you can find wherever you get your podcasts.

Monster Hunter World,Timothy Nunes,PlayStation Universe,https://www.psu.com/reviews/monster-hunter-world-review/," Timothy Nunes / January 25, 2018It had been hours since I started fighting that damn Rathalos. Each time, I had a satisfying exchange, inflicting tons of damage with my insect glaive. I had it on the ropes time and time again, but time and time again he found a way to decimate me with his enraged and erratic aerial movements. The insect glaive wasn't doing enough. I had to try something else.On a whim, I picked up the Switch Axe. I wasn’t completely familiar with its combos or nuances, but I chose it anyway. This time, I found success as I learned this new weapon. This could be it. After he fled, I caught him sleeping in its nest at the top of the forest. I switched my axe to its elemental form and went ham on the Rathalos' cranium. In a rage it woke, swinging and flipping every which way. I narrowly dodged a fireball, and it turned its attention on my Palico. Still enraged, it fired a blast at my Palico. The fireball struck the dam wall, releasing a wave of water at the Rathalos, sending it down the slope and off the mountain! I stood in awe at what I had seen. The tide had literally been turned. This spontaneous display was never in any Monster Hunter game I have ever played before!This is what Monster Hunter World is all about: perseverance and spectacle. But before all that, the game begins on a transport ship as you venture to the island where all the Elder Dragons are migrating. The mystery behind this reveals itself soon enough, and it does something that no Monster Hunter has done before. Monster Hunter World manages to delivers both what Monster Hunter is at its core and how it works. It doesn't detail every little thing, because there would be no time to play if it did that. There's just enough information delivered in a memorable and beneficial way, all while ensure that you still learn on your own. With all its moving parts, there's a charm of expanding your knowledge this way that a simple tutorial could never equal.This approach is unique to what the franchise has normally done. Before this, these games simply had a wall of text that explained the core concept of the game, trying to iterate as much as possible without overfilling your short term memory. However, that cup runneth over almost every time. Here, you're allowed to absorb content and context in a more natural way. The Monster Hunter World narrative gives a focus to your hunts, allowing you to spend more time trying new things instead of shuffling through menus and tutorials just to figure out what to do next.What truly flabbergasted me in World was the world itself. Sure, it's gorgeous and filled to the brim with little visual goodies, little nooks and crannies just waiting to be discovered, but there is so much to this game that even after playing for 50 hours I'm still learning. In fact, while running around with fellow staffer Garri Bagdasarov, I decided to actually investigate what those big, glowing beetles were for. For the longest time, I thought I had to do something special to pick them up. Instead, they act as latching points for your rope to better reach more secluded and blocked off areas. Another thing I just learned was being able to run up a wall and jump off. This is another great way to mount monsters and inflict crazy damage. In fact, there are tons of examples of these that make getting around in World so much easier, including a lift back at base.In terms of gearing, a lot of the formula remains the same: Bring the right parts to the smithy, and he'll give you what you want. A lot has changed since Monster Hunter’s last foray outside of Nintendo, however. Gear can be altered in modest, yet wonderful ways. Colors can be changed, and some of the better gear has slots for gems, which add extra stats to already stacked gear. This makes upgrades more palpable, and this gear is already tantalizing. For instance, you can add extra damage to a more defensive piece and vice versa. There's always the option of adding electric resistance to a piece that's weak to electric damage, as well.Most of the narrative is based in the low risk hunts, but you can soon after take on high risk hunts as well. These have you spawned in random zones to fend for yourself with whatever you have in your inventory. Oh, and monsters hit harder, too, and are much more aggressive. Expect a challenge, and be sure to gear yourself to the nines. The Gathering Hub above the base has special challenging missions only for the most powerful hunters, grouping you with other to take on intense fights with limited resources and time crunches. There's plenty of different ways to prove yourself in World, and they only get more challenging.While World has a ton of content and delivers on that content, it has some quirks that are hard to ignore. Monster Hunter has always been about persevering against the odds of fighting monsters towering over you, so the game is not expected to be easy. However, the problem comes with how the game bottlenecks the pace into a more linear focus. This is honestly one of the best ways to help players progress along, as it allows access to just enough monsters to make the gear necessary to keep going. In spite of that, the narrative shifts pace after a while and has you spending a ton of time gathering information across all zones. Arguably, this pushes you to explore the maps more closely and find even more things to fill your coffers, but the feeling of progress comes to a complete halt at these points. Leading into these quests, the narrative has a healthy, forward-moving pace with just enough mystery to face that next big set of teeth. I was at odds with this point for a long time. There are strong positives and negatives. I understand what's being done here, but it can take away from a good thing. The parts that follow are equally interesting, as the stakes behind the monster migration continue to grow, but the stuttered pace begins to take away that feeling of growth that comes with the story line.Teaming up with other hunters is much harder than it should be as well. You can join someone's session that makes it technically easier to group up with other hunters. Unfortunately, these sessions are more like servers rather than social hubs. From there, someone posts a quest, and everyone who wants to participate can sign up for that quest. This isn't much different than when Monster Hunter was adhoc-only, but the only thing that tells you what’s going on is a series of small on-screen prompts. The reason this isn't a full-blown negative is that you have the option to use an SOS Flare and call in assistance to anyone who responds to it, which is a happy medium between struggle and progression, but the overall grouping process could be cleaner.While all extra and optional missions can be done with friends, the vast majority of the narrative quests are single player only and cannot be repeated. Way back when, there were very few quests that couldn't be played with friends. I'm torn on this point as well. There's a sense of validation that comes from playing through these fights on your own. They test your mettle, and they prove yourself worthy to continue on. This formula also makes it so that, unlike the old games, you couldn't just have your friends run you through everything and max you out in an evening or two. At the same time, it's a shame that hunters can't start out together and grow together. There's a lot to learn in the World, and having a struggle buddy makes it all the sweeter.Denying the success of Monster Hunter World would simply be lying. There's a focus here to an old formula that only needed that special touch to open it to the rest of the gaming world. It's very, very close. It has its little qualms, but never before has Monster Hunter been so welcoming, and never before has it been so vivacious and teeming with life. Monster Hunter World is AAA from head to tail, with only a little tarnish on its fine coat of scales.With little in its way, Monster Hunter World smashes expectations with its organic, living, beautiful world. Matchmaking has its quirks and qualms, but little stands in the way of what’s been created here. Monster Hunter World raises the bar high without distilling what made the franchise special in the first place.
