Ghost of Tsushima,Chris Tapsell,Eurogamer,https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-07-14-ghost-of-tsushima-review-a-likeable-if-clunky-hollywood-blockbuster,"The horse you ronin on.Quite early on in Ghost of Tsushima, you'll be introduced to its dramatic, one-on-one duels. Two warriors, a dozen yards apart, face each other down across the divide. Up close: narrowing eyes and crumpled brows. Hands hover at hips, knees bend, feet press down into the earth, muscle, sinew and fingers tighten. Then - bang! - combat. It's a cracking moment, especially the first time you give one a try, and it's also a cracking example of what Ghost of Tsushima's all about. These heightened standoffs begin with shot-for-shot facsimiles of that famous scene from Yojimbo, an Akira Kurosawa classic that's both a mirror of older westerns and an inspiration for the '60s greats. They're also, once you've done a few of them, slightly flat, the enemies you battle mostly re-using the same attacks and movements of ones you've faced before, and the concept quickly becomes a little overused, predictably occurring at the end of certain quests, and generally lacking the complexity to require more than a few tries each time. Like the game itself, they go for authenticity through facsimile - recreating moments without the requisite weight and context. And, like the game itself, they're lacking a little depth. Despite the immediate and undeniable thrill, the gloss can be just a little too quick to wear off.Still, much of Ghost of Tsushima is enjoyable enough. Developer Sucker Punch has definitely aimed high with its first full-length effort since InFamous Second Son, way back at the start of the generation in 2014. The much-trumpeted inspirations here are the stirring epics of samurai cinema. It's a tough genre to crack, nevermind the potential for awkwardness in an American realisation of feudal Japan. Namechecked directors like Akira Kurosawa, who gets his own grainy, black-and-white mode in Ghost of Tsushima, are known for their lengthy epics of extraordinary nuance, adapting - and arguably mastering - the works of Shakespeare, or chipping away at the great problem of the human condition. Next to inspirations like that, Ghost of Tsushima is never really going to compare. It lacks the nuance and the depth, or the dedication, even, to telling a good story itself - as opposed to telling a story that simply keeps out of the way of the mechanics - and the slack left by its story isn't picked up in those mechanics, either. But it has a kind of Hollywood, popcorn charm, which shouldn't count for nothing.In Ghost of Tsushima you are Jin Sakai, a samurai of noble birth, tasked with almost single-handedly fending off a Mongol invasion of the feudal Japanese island he calls home. In doing so you're forced to evolve, from staid and honourable samurai to the Ghost, master of underhand tactics. And therein lies your central conflict, as the screenwriting gurus would put it: Jin has to defend the people of the island, but he does so at great cost, abandoning tradition, honour, and everything that comes with it. It's a bit of a cliché - and one that happily departs from Sucker Punch's stated aim for authenticity, when you read historians' arguments that for most samurai in feudal Japan, there was no such code of honour at all - but Ghost of Tsushima is good at carrying you along with the drama. It's helped by some stellar voice work from a cracking cast, including a turn from the magnetic François Chau, of Lost fame, as a curmudgeonly master archer Sensei Ishikawa, and an imperious Patrick Gallagher as the big bad Khotun Khan, a fictional descendant of that famous one Ghengis. There are some stirring sequences, too, especially when Sucker Punch digs a little deeper into its characters to mine their pockets of rage, or just finds an excuse for another heroic charge, while the family-political intrigue is at least more accurate to the period than the lengthy monologuing on honour and tradition. And there's a stunning, sweeping score to accompany it all, capable of dragging you up from even the deepest mid-game cutscene malaise, carrying you across rolling landscapes and striking wonderfully at the story's noticeable highs. What it lacks is the grit to go with the melodrama. Samurai tales are, famously, much the same as what we'd more quickly recognise as westerns, and as such they're reliant on certain things to really work. One of them is that grit, or rather a sort of tangible earthiness, that comes from a particular grounding in the world. There have been obvious examples of earthy cowboy games recently but the best illustration in this case remains The Witcher 3, which told a similar story of a stoic, semi-outlawed warrior riding into villages and solving problems with his sword, but did so through the immense weight of its world, through the detail and humanity of its side stories and the intimacy of its smaller, quieter moments. There are countless others - Assassin's Creed's now known for its side stories that bring levity, heart and mystery, and the first Red Dead Redemption has even been cited by Sucker Punch as inspiration.This is why Ghost of Tsushima feels so frustrating. Side quests are the beating heart of a good outlaw story, the secret to a great samurai game that so many others not set in feudal Japan have managed to master. For Sucker Punch they seem to have been almost an afterthought. There are effectively four kinds of quest in the game: the main story, one-off side quests, mythic quests, and ""tales"" - multi-step quests - that are tied to a specific named character. The character tales are far and away the highlight - Lady Masako and Ishikawa's standing out among them, thanks to the strength of the performances and melodrama of the stories - but they're sadly over before they really begin, and the actual activities involved are still far too limited. Follow a character, track some footsteps, fight some enemies and maybe grind out some instant-fail stealth sections, onto the next. There's some minor variation on this for the mythic ones but not much - not enough - and the standalone ones are worse, often feeling like a procedural patching together of pre-set objectives and activities, wrapped in the loose-fitting context of another unnamed peasant crying for help from the Mongols. The only reward for your time with them is a nudge of XP or some upgrade materials, as opposed to a chance to really bed yourself into the character or the world itself. They're a huge disappointment.In fact, if you pick at the surface of Ghost of Tsushima it all starts to quite worryingly unravel. The world as a whole is beautiful - utterly, undeniably, oppressively beautiful. Such colour! Everywhere you look, it's crimson, windswept fields and forests of golden yolk. Sunsets and oceans, beaches and snowy mountain peaks - environments of improbable range for a temperate island of Tsushima's kind, set to broad, enrapturing splashes of orange and teal. The vivid green bamboo jungles, the ephemeral fireflies, the swirling, milky petals that rise and fall with the wind - a wind that could be a game of its own, a magic thing bending everything around you. It's a sign of a studio that's mastered the tech, with a console generation's worth of experience behind it, but what it's missing is the maturity or restraint to put it to use. Ghost of Tsushima's bursting with undeniable beauty, yes, but beauty of the obvious, in-your-face kind, the kind that doesn't offer much thematic or tonal subtlety but makes a great ad for HDR OLED televisions. It's an odd thing to find a problem with - an excess of sumptuousness - but Sucker Punch is best imagined here less as master painter than overexcited barkeeper, serving up shot after shot of wincingly concentrated emotion, slamming the table and pouring out another - bigger moon! more falling leaves! make it a double! - before you've gulped the last one down. It's a bit much.More troublesome is the construction of Tsushima's open world, which is technically open but best described as closed. It's a big area - there are three parts to the island, the second and third opening up after you reach the end of the first act plenty of hours in, and they contain all the breadth of those wildly varied biomes outlined above - but the sense of closedness comes from how little mystery there is to it. In fact, there's really no mystery at all, once you get to know the way the game works. Spanning the island are a litany of fixed, more or less identical locations-of-interest, which all involve a set interaction and a set reward (and all of which you'll be led to by the game's clunky, if admirable attempt at using nature for navigation - gallop past a nearby point of interest and a golden bird will appear, piping up incessantly in invitation to follow it to whatever that undiscovered spot may be). Those points of interest never change, though - they never deviate from the set list of things to do that you can check off from lists in the menus. So there are hot springs which you press R2 at to bathe in and increase your max health; fox dens, where you follow a mewling, over-adorable fox to a shrine, which you press R2 at to increase your max charm slots; bamboo strikes, which do at least give you a very brief, quick-reaction button-pressing minigame to beat before their designated reward (there's an accessibility option for turning off the time-sensitive element, if that sounded worrying to you). I could go on, but the point is sooner or later you'll realise this is it. A bird will chirp and, after slavishly following them until now, you'll decide the bird can do one, actually, because it's just going to take you off your path to something you've already seen and done a dozen times before. Even the rarer, more elaborate activities like Shinto Shrines - locations that sit atop mountains and cliffs, requiring a spot of ultra-light, golden ledge guided platforming to reach - start to wear thin after a couple climbs. The result of it all is a busy world, full of activities, but one that soon feels paradoxically empty of things to do. A brighter, if still imperfect part of Ghost of Tsushima is its combat. In melee, Sucker Punch has created a kind of Arkham-Sekiro hybrid, which works relatively well. Enemies all have a guard meter as well as a health meter, which will need to be broken for you to really get in there with the pointy end of your katana and do some damage. Much of your success will come from successfully countering, as is the Arkham style: you can dodge and perfect dodge, dodge-roll, parry, and perfect parry, all of which feel snappy enough - although I'd like some attack-cancelling to feel a tad sharper. And while there are unblockable enemy moves, marked with a red symbol - hello Sekiro - most of these can be turned into parryable ones with an early upgrade in the skill tree (Ghost of Tsushima has something between seven and ten skill trees, depending on how you look at it - don't ask), which unfortunately takes away much of the tension and skill. Where it gets interesting is stances: there are four stances in the game, each granting new heavy attacks effective at breaking the guards of a certain type of enemy. You unlock them and their respective skill trees one at a time - with another slightly repetitive open world task of killing certain numbers of Mongol leaders - but once you do the combat gets noticeably more interesting, becoming a much more conscious exercise. At its most satisfying, you'll be facing swollen numbers of varied enemies, requiring you to rapidly switch between stances as frequently as every enemy attack, so as to clash swords, break shields, charge archers, parry spears and slash brutes as effectively as possible. In these moments of intimate violence, the music soaring, enemies cowering and crumpled, Jin clad in some imperious armour lashed with rain and soaked in mud, Ghost of Tsushima feels glorious, and also truest to its soily roots. The problem is they come too rarely - there are a smattering of climactic battles in the story that open with a bang, before swiftly fizzling out - and too late, with the enemies only getting really varied and dense towards the end and the game falling into the usual RPG-lite trap of dishing out its most enjoyable gimmicks after a load of time without (or hiding them behind mythic quests, some of which are only accessible after certain points of the story). It struggles with the camera, which sits too low and close over the shoulder, and doesn't come with an option to lock onto an enemy. It sounds minor, but can result in annoying hits from enemies out of shot, an awkward inability to act and look around at once, or worse still a totally obscured camera altogether, if you get too close to an object or wall.Ghost of Tsushima's stealth, meanwhile - which is prominent enough to be the driving force of its story, and technically half of your own arsenal - is frustratingly unsystemic and largely underbaked. It's very much stealth-lite, closest to modern era Assassin's Creed with even fewer toys, and so you'll be frequently defaulting to the usual suspects: X-ray vision, throw a jingly distraction bell, pop a smoke bomb if you get in trouble and try again. All of that couples meekly with a range of insta-fail stealth missions and yet another selection of excessively crunching, crackling and squelching neck stabs.It's desperately frustrating, because I maintain that Ghost of Tsushima is still, largely, quite fun. The problem is it's an easy, breezy, lite beer kind of fun - the kind that Sucker Punch is known for, after all - and the blanket genericism of it just doesn't sit well against such a po-faced tone. It's another game fallen victim to the palatability blender, coming out the other side as a slightly formless smudge of every genre, without a mastery of any. Going back to Ghost of Tsushima's roots, as an American game inspired by the comics and the movies of Japan, in a way it's quite apt. It's what happens when you want to pay homage, but don't want to add anything new of your own. It's Hollywood.You're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!

Your eyeballs aren't ready, your life isn't ready, your soul isn't ready. No matter how much of a Sucker Punch fan you are, no amount of playing the Infamous series could have prepared you for this epic game. It's Assassin's Creed Japan with a Red Dead Redemption 2 sized world and an entire library's worth of Akira Kurosawa movies melted and shot directly into its veins. After days and days spent wandering forests, decapitating warlords, and stopping every now and again for a little toot of my flute, I still wanted more when the breathtaking finale signaled the end of Jin Sakai's story.Release date: July 17, 2020
Platform(s): PS4
Developer: Sucker Punch
Publisher: Sony Interactive As with many powerful drugs, the effects of the game didn't hit me until a few hours in. The prologue is beefy and a little slow, introducing samurai Jin, the survivor of a terrible battle with the invading Mongols, now desperate to rescue his uncle Lord Shimura from captivity. At first, Jin seemed like just another stony-faced video game hero, and one I felt zero chemistry with. By the final scene, I had to wipe away a tear. Jin never really got my heart racing, but the stories of the people around him did. Lady Masako, the matriarch of clan Adachi who is full of anger and secrets, thief Yuna and her brother Taka, the warrior monk Norio whose grief threatens to swallow him whole. As their tales develop, one chapter at a time, you fall deeper and deeper into the world. Quests come in various flavors, the main quest to save your uncle, those that revolve around a cast of allies, smaller side quests, and Mythical quests to learn special combat techniques. The stories are delivered in punchy chapters, which helps them feel more organic, less of a linear chore, and the performances really drive the stakes home. The horrors of the Mongol invasion hit differently when it's your friends' necks on the line. The game starts you off gently with combat, which is all about mastering your katana. Bows and bombs will play a part, but the real satisfaction comes from a perfectly timed parry or a flashy special power that slices through your enemies like they're made of butter. As you dodge and strike and parry, you build Resolve, which can then be used to perform special attacks and heal in the middle of battle. And you're going to need to heal, a lot. Ghost of Tsushima's samurai rabbit roots, fox petting, and commitment to authenticity (opens in new tab)In the opening hours of Ghost of Tsushima, I was hacking away like a butcher at any Mongols that got too close and paying the price for my clumsy mistakes. Soon, I learned the art of timing, how to use stances (easily swapped with the R2 and face buttons, and essential to make it easier to break through different enemy type's defences) and when to just get out of the way of an unblockable attack. By the end, the combat flowed like a dance, knew just when to throw out a kunai or ignite my sword to deliver fiery death, and learned to dodge attacks like I'd developed Spidey sense. I am not traditionally a fan of nuanced combat, approaching everything like a tank with PMT, but with Ghost of Tsushima, it just flowed and felt right. Not that it was ever easy, true to Sucker Punch's promise that a few mistakes can leave you crushed by a brute enemy even late in the game, so even random encounters require your full attention.As well as large battles there are more nuanced duels, where your smoke bombs and bow are stripped away, and you face an enemy with just your sword. These usually mark a key moment in the story. Framed like a movie scene, you'll be torn between survival and grabbing a perfect screenshot. The real star of Ghost of Tsushima isn't its hero Jin Sakai, it's the island that unfurls around you. Sucker Punch has delivered on its promise of using the natural world as a guide, with the wind's direction leading you to waypoints, golden birds showing the way to hidden secrets like bamboo strikes and hot springs, and foxes shepherding you to Inari shrines. With fields of pampas grass, bamboo forests, lakes, and mountains, it's like running through a painting - and with a few exceptions - everything is so colorful, so vivid, that running between quests is like a pharmaceutical strength ASMR video. You can fast travel, but you'll find you don't want to. Somehow, between the adventures and enemy bases and Mongol patrols, the world finds space for moments of quiet. There are places to stop and compose a haiku, hot springs where, after a flash of butt, you're asked to reflect on your relationship with your uncle or a recent event. There are other shrines that sit atop mountains and require a steady foot and a grappling hook to get to, and banners hidden away just begging to be collected. It's more than just set-dressing too, everything has a purpose. You'll get a new item, like a headband, or a saddle, or your Resolve will increase, or your maximum health. Even playing your flute - for which you can earn new melodies by seeking out singing crickets - changes the weather. It's like the world of Ghost of Tsushima has its own language that you learn to recognize, making flipping to the world map almost entirely redundant. The only complaint, which is just highlighted by the richness of the world elsewhere, is that  occasionally you'll find an area that feels like there should be more there, an empty village or Mongol camp, where the story will almost certainly take you later. You can still search for supplies and secrets in the empty buildings, but it feels like wandering onto an empty stage. In the third act - no spoilers - you're suddenly in an area that feels bleak compared to the riots of color and activity in the first and second act, and it's like being plunged into a cold bath. Yes, it marks a twist in the tale but... it's just not as much fun. These are minor complaints in a game that gave me packed days and nights of adventure and storytelling, made me shed a tear and Google grief support groups, and gave me a new love for the history and traditions of feudal Japan. There's so much to do, such fervent, visible love for the subject matter - from the ink brush artwork that appears in cutscenes when you're hearing a mythical tale, to the Kurosawa Mode filter that paints the world in a cinematic monochrome and was given the blessing of Akira Kurosawa’s estate. It would be understandable for developer Sucker Punch to feel nervous about releasing a game so close to the critically-acclaimed The Last of Us 2, and as PS5 glimmers on the horizon, but it shouldn't. This is a worthy swan song for the PS4, and a tribute to the Japanese culture it so clearly reveres. We reviewed Ghost of Tsushima on a PS4 Pro.Rachel Weber is the US Managing Editor of GamesRadar+ and lives in Brooklyn, New York.

Ghost of Tsushima,Matt Miller,Game Informer,https://www.gameinformer.com/review/ghost-of-tsushima/ghost-of-tsushima-review-a-most-honorable-epic,"Most great games stand on the shoulders of their predecessors. Ghost of Tsushima unabashedly borrows many of its strongest features from other open-world adventures, and executes on them with skill. The game owes a tremendous debt to the Assassin’s Creed games; in many ways, Ghost of Tsushima feels like an entry in that franchise set in Japan – something that fans have longed for. But it’s unfair to paint Sucker Punch’s immense samurai epic as a copycat. By tapping into Japanese art, history, and culture, as well as the samurai film tradition that followed, Ghost of Tsushima finds a wholly original tone within the gaming landscape. Across an especially vast adventure, players are treated to a tale about the contradictory ideals of honor and revenge, and one in which tense katana duels and quiet moments of reflection claim equal focus.Structurally, Ghost of Tsushima is an adventure told in three acts, each almost wholly dedicated to one geographical section of a massive island. Astride your loyal horse (whose name you select early on), you gallop between Mongol-occupied forts, idyllic Buddhist temples, and remote mountaintop shrines, gradually ticking off completed locations as your honor-sworn warrior grows in power and acquires new weapons and tools. From convenient fast-travel options to smart delineations of mission types, you always know what you’re working toward and how to move forward. Side missions and distractions are plentiful, and full engagement with the bulk of the content is a project of 50+ hours.As the survivor of a doomed samurai charge to hold off a Mongol invasion, Jin Sakai is a conflicted and tortured hero. Trained to be the best of his samurai caste, the tension between his familial duty and the need for justice forms the heart of the story. A small but richly drawn cast of allies surrounds him – each flawed in their own way – who are coming to terms with their warring natures. The interwoven stories that unfold carry very little lightheartedness or humor, instead opting for a somber contemplation on the horrors of war. They portray a mother’s grief for her murdered grandchildren, the weight of survivor’s guilt, and the loss of innocence when we perceive our heroes’ failings. As a player, moments of true victory are rare – try to save a man’s family, only to find his wife and child are already dead. The game is a meditation on suffering, and I was surprised by Sucker Punch’s uncompromising adherence to that vision.Rather than counter that form with levity, Ghost of Tsushima finds relief in nature’s beauty. The island of Tsushima is an exaggerated and painterly vision of feudal Japan, where gently curving cherry trees blow endless blossoms across windswept fields of pampas grass. Set a new objective marker, and the breeze shifts direction to take you to your destination. Birds and foxes emerge to guide you to hidden hot springs and shrines. Especially impressive weather effects set the mood, from ghostly fog-shrouded forests to thunderstorms that presage moments of conflict. Scattered mats invite you to sit and craft poetry with a dedicated haiku mechanic. The artistic presentation, alongside one of the best scores in recent memory, make for a world well worth fighting to save, which makes its desecration feel especially perverse.The invading Mongol army and its stoic commander, Khotun Khan, emerge as fearsome antagonists, ably subverting Japanese defenses by taking advantage of the samurai’s guiding code. The Khan’s tactics and brutality are especially heinous, and you’ll be almost as eager as the protagonist to bring him down. His minions may not have the same narrative depth, but their varied weapons, attack patterns, and appearances keep the moment-to-moment encounters exciting and challenging, even late into the game.In encountering the enemy, players balance two competing playstyles. The first is a particularly smooth and gratifying melee combat system, focused on wielding the katana in a variety of stances. Battles are deadly and precise, and the focus on defensive parrying is a fun challenge. With a dedicated stance for each primary enemy type, combat demands observation of your enemy and quick reaction time. Sophisticated animation work lends a cinematic quality to the fast-paced battles.The second approach to combat takes Jin down the questionable path of infiltration and assassination. Over time, several tools enhance the options here, letting players mess with the enemy or terrorize them into flight. Both approaches are deeply satisfying; you don’t face consequences for being sneaky instead of straightforward, so it’s not about picking one or the other. You choose your tactics based on what is most appealing to you in a given encounter.Both styles of play are supported by a robust set of upgrades, many of which provide meaningful new options. I love how the progression front-loads the things you really want for your character into the first half of the game, like parrying blows and deflecting arrows. However, this also means you spend points on things you don’t especially care about later on. On the bright side, the game reserves a couple of its coolest new powers, ability-infused armor sets, and cosmetic options for the late-game, so I remained engaged with progression even after my core tree of upgrades had been mostly filled.The “tales” that take you between one encounter to the next are mostly enjoyable, and certainly plentiful. Every one of the main narrative missions feels distinct, often presenting rousing large-scale battles and honorable one-on-one duels. The dedicated and multi-part tales for each of your allies are equally worthwhile, telling personal and pathos-laden stories of loss. A third variety of minor tales about the citizens of Tsushima pale in comparison; they grow repetitive, but they’re mostly there for players who simply desire more time in this gorgeous world. My only notable frustration was with occasionally unclear objectives or targets focused on tracking or investigation, leading to moments of fruitless circling of an area until I happened upon the next marker.Beyond these structured missions, thorough map exploration leads to many enjoyable discoveries, from health-boosting hot springs to hard-to-reach shrines that provide new charms to enhance your abilities. I appreciated the many hidden caves and hideaways the map had in store, and I liked the opportunity to do some relatively simple platforming. However, traversal and climbing challenges often trace very static paths, with little freedom to chart one’s own course, and I sometimes found those sequences a bit simplistic.Ghost of Tsushima captures the mystique, fierce violence, and barely contained emotional angst of the great samurai films. The line of inspiration is clearly purposeful; Sucker Punch included a gorgeous “Kurosawa Mode,” which sets a black-and-white, film-grain, audio-treated effect that doubles down on the classic cinematic vibe. It’s well worth turning on, if only for a few missions. But even beyond that cool feature, this is a game that nails the aesthetic it’s shooting for, firmly establishing itself as the medium’s defining samurai saga.

Ghost of Tsushima,Carolyn Petit,Polygon,https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/7/14/21322970/ghost-of-tsushima-review-ps4-kurosawa-mode,"Filed under:A great setting let down by rote design Ghost of Tsushima, the new open-world adventure from Infamous developer Sucker Punch Productions, has a wonderful asset in the island setting that gives the game its name. This fictionalized version of Tsushima is a vast, beautiful place thankfully not limited by strict adherence to historical or geographical accuracy, but instead tinged with myth and magic. Unfortunately, the gameplay that takes up your time on Tsushima is overly safe and familiar, resulting in a game that’s packed with lovely spots to discover and offers moments of peaceful reflection, yet still struggles to differentiate itself from numerous other open-world adventures.Ghost of Tsushima begins as an era of stability and prosperity for the samurai ends. The game is set in 1274, the year of the first Mongol invasion of Japan. The intelligent and brutal Mongol chieftain Khotun Khan, a fictional figure positioned here as the grandson of Genghis Khan, aims to use the island of Tsushima as a strategic foothold from which to conquer the Japanese mainland. Though wildly outnumbered, the samurai of Tsushima gather for an all-out assault on the Khan’s forces, and most of them meet their deaths. However, one young samurai, Jin Sakai, is rescued and nursed back to health by a peasant thief named Yuna. Desperate to save his people, Jin becomes caught between the ideals of honor his uncle has spent a lifetime teaching him, which dictate that a samurai always face his enemies openly and fairly, and the lessons Yuna teaches him, that such honor is a luxury not all can afford, and that to face the Mongol forces head-on can mean only defeat and death. Both lessons are correct, just as both lessons are wrong.Though we see young Jin being taught that a samurai must control his emotions, he is thankfully no stoic hero. He remains open enough about his feelings that we understand how difficult the path that he follows throughout the game becomes for him. He’s assailed both from within, due to his belief that a samurai must conduct himself honorably at all times, and from without, due to the people he loves who still cling to those old ideas expressing their disappointment in his actions. Jin’s first stealth kill is almost traumatic for him, and it’s clear that it will be hard for him to live with the dishonor of killing from the shadows. I was performing stealth kills left and right soon enough, however, since games rarely let the feelings of regret shown in cutscenes slow down the violence of the action itself.Still, we understand the personal sacrifice he is making to break with the traditions he has known his whole life as he assumes the identity of the Ghost, a vengeful warrior who resorts to these “dishonorable” measures — stabbing foes in the back, poisoning their drinks, whatever it takes — to protect and liberate his people. He’s doing his best in the fiction of the game, but the only way for him to be effective is to operate in ways that go against every ounce of his training. Such morally ambiguous heroes are commonplace, of course, but the particular weight of honor and tradition Jin bears allows Ghost of Tsushima to navigate this well-trodden territory in a way that feels distinctive and appropriate to the game’s setting. Jin does what he feels he must to protect Japan from its would-be conquerors, and for it, he ultimately pays a heavy personal price. Ghost of Tsushima’s tale isn’t one of unambiguous victory or triumph. The samurai films of director Akira Kurosawa, after all, which Ghost of Tsushima expressly pays homage to, may be a lot of things — funny, thrilling, and often tragic — but they were never comforting stories with upbeat endings. Right off the bat, in fact, Ghost of Tsushima asks if you’d like to play in what it calls Kurosawa Mode, a black-and-white filter “inspired by the movies of legendary filmmaker Akira Kurosawa,” making it clear from the get-go that its vision of feudal Japan owes at least as much to cinema as it does to history. It’s a bold claim, but the attention to detail in Ghost of Tsushima, particularly in its world and costumes, is meticulous enough that the game earns the right to name-drop the master. Well, with one small but significant exception. Kurosawa Mode automatically turns on the game’s Japanese dialogue option, with English subtitles. However, with all the dramatic close-ups the cutscenes indulge in, it’s impossible to ignore that the characters’ lips are synced to English dialogue, not Japanese dialogue. I wish the developers had taken that extra step and modeled the characters against the Japanese voice-over. Let people who opt for the English dialogue deal with the lip movements being out of sync; after all, it would only contribute to the feeling that you’re watching a Japanese film dubbed into English. The way it’s handled now is a strange choice considering how hard Sucker Punch worked to create a sense of authenticity in most other areas of the game.As much of a sucker as I am for a good film-grain effect, though, I didn’t want to miss out on the bold colors of Tsushima. I did keep the Japanese dialogue option, however, especially since the actors give their lines the sort of heightened dramatic energy you’d expect from a tale of honor, betrayal, and bloodshed such as this. Jin travels across the island of Tsushima, hoping to save it by gathering what few allies remain to aid him in his battles against a formidable enemy. Sucker Punch convincingly sells the idea of a small force going up against overwhelming odds. Before many battles, Jin and his allies will scout the enemy defenses, determining how best to use what little military strength they have to exploit any of their opponent’s weaknesses. I appreciated that Ghost of Tsushima took the time to make me feel attached to its characters, so that the stakes of what Jin and his allies are fighting for mean something. I enjoyed the honest, revealing conversation over bottles of sake between two comrades-in-arms the night before an overwhelming siege they knew they might not survive — almost as much as I enjoyed the battle itself.In fact, it’s the moments between characters that I’ll remember most about my time with Ghost of Tsushima. There are strings of side quests that give you the opportunity to spend time with your closest allies, and though the combat scenarios that pepper these quests are unremarkable, the conversations between characters as you walk or ride from one spot to the next make them worthwhile.I valued these quests not for the chance to fight yet another predictable battle, but for the insight they offered into these people’s lives and their philosophies. Particularly memorable are a few quests you can do with Yuriko, Jin’s childhood caretaker, now an elderly woman he has enlisted for her knowledge of poisonous flowers. Her quests offer an opportunity for reflection on memory, decline, and impermanence, and they tie in beautifully with the natural splendor of the island itself.With its quasi-historical setting and its open world filled with activities and upgrades, comparisons to the Assassin’s Creed games are inevitable, so let’s not beat around the bush: Ghost of Tsushima is extremely reminiscent of many entries in the Ubisoft action franchise and other, similar open-world games, both in terms of its combat and its structure. If you like maps with a lot of icons on them offering up things to do, you’re going to be very happy with this game. This is a world that, for better or worse — worse, if you ask me — lays itself out for you like a buffet crying out to be consumed. Everywhere you go, you’re liable to hear the telltale chirp of a golden bird, eager to lead you to yet another of the game’s hundreds of points of interest, where another collectible or another opportunity for incremental progress toward some upgrade awaits. Look, I’m a simple woman. If a golden bird wants to lead me somewhere, I want to follow. If there’s a question mark on my map, I want to find out what it is. But with those aforementioned birds, who chirp at you all the time — with its genuinely overwhelming number of artifacts, written records, crickets, banners, saddles, sword kits, headbands, masks, charms, and other items to collect — Ghost of Tsushima is overeager, desperate even, to constantly make me feel rewarded or to show me that I’m making meaningful progress. This eats away at my ability to see the world of the game as a world rather than as a collection of things to do and grab and earn.Among the points of interest the golden birds want to guide you to are hot springs that offer permanent health increases; shinto shrines that provide very Assassin’s Creed-style environmental platforming challenges you can complete in exchange for charms that confer passive bonuses; and spots where you compose haiku by selecting lines of poetry via multiple choice to earn cosmetic rewards. It’s all thematically cohesive, and the haiku spots are interesting for the way they pull your focus entirely onto a lovely environmental scene as Jin contemplates death or loss or another aspect of the human condition. However, as sometimes happens with games of this type, you encounter the same experiences and challenges so routinely that they start to feel like cookie-cutter bits of consumable content rather than opportunities organically nestled in the environment you’re exploring. The illusion might have been a little stronger if there were just fewer of each activity, making each one more meaningful.It’s a shame that Ghost of Tsushima doesn’t put more trust in its setting, because the real reward for exploring Tsushima could have just been taking in all of its picturesque beauty: a tranquil pond overseen by a statue of the Buddha; a dueling circle in which leaves gently fall, red as blood; a grassy field, its gentleness offset by a single, arrow-riddled corpse. This beauty remains remarkable, but it loses something when the game is always finding ways to say, “Psst! Over here! More progress toward unlocking your next charm slot awaits,” instead of giving you the time and space to stop for a moment and enjoy your surroundings for their own sake. Sucker Punch seems to constantly be trying to lead you away from what the game does well and toward what other media has done well, from the open-world design to the look of the game itself.Ghost of Tsushima’s combat, too, while full-featured in terms of the assortment of stealthy and more overt combat options on offer, is overly familiar. You’ll sneak up on many perfectly positioned enemies to perform stealth kills, then slink back into tall grass that shields you from the gaze of other enemies. You’ll free bears from cages so that they can wreak havoc on their captors and make your work a little easier. You might toss smoke bombs to disappear from sight, or throw a wind chime to distract a nearby enemy. It’s not that these elements are bad, of course. They’re all handled well here, offering the same familiar satisfactions I’ve felt in other, similar games in the past, as I’ve leapt from a rooftop to assassinate an enemy from above or fired an arrow at some explosive barrels. It’s not bad — it’s just rote.Games aren’t designed in a vacuum; they should be in conversation with each other and seek to build on what came before. The problem is that Ghost of Tsushima isn’t interested in doing much building. There’s a superficial samurai aesthetic here, and a very good one, but in terms of the rhythms of battle and the feel and function of the tools at your disposal, the combat, with a few cosmetic changes, could have been taken from so many other games, or put into so many other games, that I could never find the particular soul of this game. Ghost of Tsushima does at least require you to rely on different techniques at different times so that you can’t get overly comfortable with a single approach. A covert rescue mission where you sneak into a castle claimed by the Mongols demands stealth, for instance, while a few large-scale cinematic battles see you openly confronting enemy forces with your most trusted allies at your side, hacking and slashing to get through as many soldiers as possible. Jin never really has to choose between his chosen method of combat and the art of “dishonorable” guerrilla war, but must indulge in both styles at different times, using different tactics. The game’s flair for the dramatic also surfaces in the standoff, an option that’s available to you when you first approach a group of enemies. It’s essentially the equivalent of an Old West gunslinger duel, but with samurai swords. If you opt for it, Jin will call out to his foes, challenging them openly and alerting them to his presence.One enemy will step forward to face Jin. If you release a button at the precise moment the enemy strikes, you’ll fell him with a single slash; if your timing is off, you’ll be gravely wounded. Of course, calling out for a direct confrontation with your opponent may be honorable, but it also alerts him and all of his nearby allies to your presence. These are tense, enjoyable moments of death, violence, and honor.The ghost stance is unlocked at a certain point of the game as well, acting as a mechanical reflection of the legend of the Ghost spreading and striking fear into the hearts of Jin’s enemies. After pulling off certain feats — most commonly by killing several enemies in a row without taking damage — you can activate the ghost stance and send nearby foes into a panic that lets you easily mow a few of them down. It’s a fine reward for skillful play, elevated by its intensely dramatic presentation as the screen fills with red. Boss battles are pure, one-on-one duels that strip away all your tools and require you to rely only on observation and precise timing. You have to understand your enemy’s attack patterns so you can know when to dodge, when to parry, and when to strike. While most encounters made me feel quite overpowered as I threw kunai and sticky bombs at enemies and fired explosive arrows that gave me an edge even over larger groups, my heart was often racing due to the level of focus demanded by these face-offs with Jin’s most dangerous adversaries.Though I’ve completed the main story in Ghost of Tsushima, done numerous side quests, liberated some Mongol-occupied strongholds, collected tons of cosmetic gear, and done several of every type of activity the game offers, there are still vast swaths of my map that remain shrouded. Do I really want to repeat each kind of mission or challenge over and over, until I’ve seen it all? Probably — not because I care to acquire yet another charm that gives me a passive bonus or any other little tchotchke, but because when you strip all that stuff away, the world underneath it is beautiful in its own right, and I want to see what picturesque spots remain waiting to be discovered. I’m playing through the busy work the game presents me for a reward that should have been given much more freely: the ability to just exist in, and enjoy looking at, this gorgeous world.I also love the way Jin looks in his loose-fitting traveler’s attire as he moves across the landscape, his tattered cape blowing in the wind just so, as if he, too, is simply another part of the flow of life and death on the isle. But as much as I enjoy this game’s style, it’s not quite enough. The best open-world adventures of recent years do something that sets their gameplay apart so they can rise above the crowd and hopefully mature the genre. Sucker Punch never found anything in the gameplay itself that would allow Ghost of Tsushima to similarly stand apart, and that’s its largest failing. It feels like a game that’s destined to go on sale, and then perhaps be seen as a slight cult classic as more and more people discover that its derivative play is hiding some serious charm in its visual design and some impressive environmental work.  Ghost of Tsushima has a distinctive aesthetic, after all, but it’s only skin-deep. The core game underneath that alluring exterior is a pastiche of open-world game design standards from five years ago; it lacks a real personality of its own. Ghost of Tsushima offers a lovely world to explore, and there’s value in that, but it should have been so much more than a checklist of activities to accomplish.

   on July 19, 2020 at 6:16PM PDTIf a youthful obsession with Japanese samurai cinema and an audiobook version of Musashi have taught me anything, it's that if you want to be a great swordfighter, having a connection to nature is important. Skill with a weapon isn't purely driven by physical strength and technique, but also by the acuity that comes from observing trees, mountains, and rivers. Something like that.While I can only make guesses as to how inspirational the rural areas of feudal Japan would have been, the scenic island portrayed in Ghost of Tsushima, an open-world 13th-century samurai epic, is one that often stirs something inside me. Beyond being a game centred around flashy sword fights and the journey of Jin Sakai to becoming a proto-ninja, Ghost of Tsushima invites you to lose yourself deeply in its grasslands, forests, and mountains. And though the tasks you're given often aren't as brilliant as the colour of the leaves, there's certainly something wonderfully humbling about just riding your horse through this beautiful environment and taking it all in.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Ghost Of Tsushima Review And what an immediately beautiful world it is, full of bold, saturated colours, grandiose weather effects, and an overabundance of windswept leaves, petals, butterflies, and other small particles that make every location feel alive. The island of Tsushima is a painter's palette; vibrant red and yellow forests sit atop inviting green hills by day, blinding sunsets soak everything in a deep orange. At night, bright white moonlight glistens off dark blue lakes and waterfalls to illuminate everything around you. The game has an option to turn everything black and white in order to mimic the samurai films of Akira Kurosawa, but using it forgoes Tsushima's own distinct visual identity.At times, it almost feels as if art direction is trying a little bit too hard to draw attention to itself. And Ghost of Tsushima certainly makes a concerted effort to try and absorb you into its radiant world even further with its deliberate lack of navigational information. There's no option for an on-screen minimap or a compass to see which way you're going, and objective markers are barely there. Instead, the game features an in-world device called Guiding Wind, in which the game's plethora of organic particles will subtly fall towards the location of whatever objective you need to reach. A swipe of the DualShock's touchpad will magically and visibly summon a strong gust that kicks up even more particles in an almost comically self-indulgent way, which acts as a more obvious nudge in the right direction.It's a great system. Without anything to draw your eyes away from your character and the world, the Guiding Wind pushes you to pay more attention to your surroundings, to let you more quickly internalise key landmarks that help you to get your bearings more easily later on, or just to feast your eyes. Other in-world devices, like plumes of smoke, flying songbirds, foxes, Torii gates, talkative non-player characters, and more help to guide (or rather, distract) you toward new activities.A lot of these activities also work in service of making sure you see Tsushima's good side. Foxes will invite you to follow them down charming paths to nearby Inari shrines. Torii gates will lead you to simple but daring-looking platforming challenges that reward you with spectacular vistas. Haikus ask you to sit down and reflect on your picturesque surroundings. Singing crickets will unlock songs for Jin's flute, which let you magically command the dramatic weather at will. You get equipment early on that helps you track down the game's myriad collectables through the Guiding Wind and controller vibration, and some convenient touches like a generous and very quick-loading fast travel system help make Tsushima be an incredibly pleasant place to move through, especially when armed with the game's robust photo mode to take screenshots with. While you do need to enter a menu-based world map if you want to go somewhere specific, without a marker to constantly signal your next objective's location, you definitely get a little less obsessed with taking the most direct route, and feel more naturally inclined to just follow winding roads around mountains and along river banks. Guiding Wind creates a flow that gives you plenty of opportunities to drive your own curious exploration. As an open-world device, it also succeeds in masking the feeling that you're simply being strung along by objective markers, even though that's still exactly what you're doing.That feeling does still come up, unfortunately, when Ghost of Tsushima's quests (referred to as Tales) take hold of the reins. Tales fall back on rote open-world quest structures, where you do things like follow a quest giver to an objective, perhaps having a chat on the way, and veering off the assigned path here isn't allowed. Sometimes you'll be asked to survey or examine an environment, activities which have the ability to devolve into meticulous hunts for interactable hotspots. Some early Tales have you chasing macguffin after macguffin to the point of being silly, making you wonder if anything is going to happen at all. Anytime you're not engaged in combat, a lot of these quests, especially side quests, can feel like a drag.The cutscenes that host conversations between Jin and other characters, which give context to these Tales, largely feel stilted, which further underscores the tedium. That's not the fault of the acting--Ghost of Tsushima has some passionate and strong-sounding Japanese voice work, at least to my non-speaker ear, though there is a visible disconnect with character lip-syncing, which retains the mocap performances of the (notably all-Asian) English cast. Even though I preferred the Japanese voice audio, the two tracks do offer some differences in regards to their overall tone.The voice work is largely let down by a noticeable lack of bodily expression in the almost motionless character models, meaning you're basically just watching a couple of talking heads most of the time. That's not uncommon to see in titles of this nature, but it is a significant low point in a game that otherwise hits so many stylistic highs. The cinematography, which frames the characters in pleasing ways within the gorgeous scenery, instead does the heavy lifting to make sure these regular moments are at least somewhat pleasing to the eye--though wide shots do draw more attention to the fact that two conversing bodies are standing perfectly still. This means that a lot of the game's emotional arcs and vibrant characters don't hit as hard as they should. Ghost Of Tsushima clearly aims to evoke golden-age samurai cinema in many ways, but it doesn't manage to capture even a tiny amount of their vigor when it comes to exposition--Mifune-level gusto is completely out of the question here.There are some exceptions to this. The primary story quests give the characters involved a bit more freedom to move, and naturally benefit from hosting the more interesting plot threads: that of Jin's inescapable metamorphosis from a by-the-books samurai square to something a lot more unscrupulous for the greater good, and how this change affects the relationship with his loving but uncompromising father figure. The combat encounters here also benefit from some great set pieces, heightened by a strong musical score that helps construct those rousing blockbuster moments that always seem to be able to pull at your emotions, no matter how impartial you're trying to be.Character-specific Tales have a little more to offer too, and see Jin assist his closest allies with their own dire issues. These multi-part questlines can feel like wild goose chases, especially at the beginning of the game, but they all offer their own interesting (and violent) stories of familial bonds, one of the game's major running themes.Mythic Tales are Ghost Of Tsushima's most interesting quest offering, though they are few in number. These are explorations into the slightly more supernatural elements of the world, featuring their own special animated introductions. They attempt to pull away from the direct point-to-point structure of the other quests by asking you to do things like look at a hand-drawn map and use your own deductive exploration to find the objective location, or perform an activity with a simple mechanical twist. They can still feel like wild goose chases, but the rewards for the more involved nature of them are significant--aside from the main questline, this is your other avenue for earning new types of weapons, armour, and abilities, usually after a climactic one-on-one boss duel.Those duels, and Ghost of Tsushima's combat in general, is where the game does successfully evoke samurai cinema. Jin's katana remains your primary weapon throughout the whole game; it can fell enemies in a few quick slices, but likewise, Jin can also die quickly after a few good hits from opposing blades. This means blocking, parrying, and dodging are the main skills you need to learn how to both use and overcome properly, and though there is more leeway than something like Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, battles can still be over in seconds if you make blunders. This gives every fight in the game a degree of heart-pounding tension, from the game's first fight to its final, whether it be a lowly bandit or a master swordsman, even in the otherwise rote quests, and no matter what difficulty you're playing on.Combat does a fantastic job at approximating the highly-stylised version of one-versus-many sword fighting as seen in films like Harakiri or the Samurai trilogy, where long standoffs and quick, flourished movements mark the ebb and flow of suspense and excitement. Most encounters can be initiated by triggering a one-on-one standoff, a tense game of chicken where you need to wait until your enemy has committed to an attack and then counter it in the split second afterward, dispatching them in one quick fell swoop. Once that formality has passed, enemies will often try to surround you and attack in tandem, and decisive success often depends on patiently waiting for a clear opening for attack, lest you get interrupted by a follow-up blow. Perhaps you might need to wait for an advance so you can perfectly deflect it and counter, or break someone's guard to stagger them with some decisive heavy strikes--indiscriminate flailing will see you thrown off balance quickly. A Resolve meter, charged by defeating enemies, earns you opportunities to perform devastating special attacks or heal yourself, creating small risk-reward decisions to think about. Regularly changing your active fighting stance (each unlocked after encountering enough enemy leaders) to better handle the different kinds of weapons your opponents are wielding adds to the many considerations you need to make, as do ranged opponents and the extra tools you'll eventually have at your disposal as Jin begins to learn more deceitful methods of combat.Unlike the game's quest cutscenes, Jin's suite of animations, along with the gore and foley associated with combat, do a lot to make the act of sinking a katana into flesh feel meaningful. Flourishes like how Jin returns to stance after a kill, and the graceful movements that accompany a successful parry give everything an observable flow. Switching stances (which slows down time) just before dodging a hit and responding with an advantageous technique feels really good. Taking a step back and watching a video of a good fight you might have just recorded can be like witnessing a well-choreographed action scene. In addition to exploring the world, combat is where Ghost of Tsushima's most transcendent moments lie.But it's not without flaws; combat is sometimes let down by a couple of major factors. When fighting on uneven terrain like staggered rock formations and inclines, the tightly-interlocked cause and effect of parries and blows starts to unravel, resulting in holes where animations occur but their effects are not passed on. The camera can also be an issue; it should be noted that Ghost of Tsushima does not feature an enemy lock-on function as part of its toolsuite. Presumably, this is because enemies are constantly attacking from all directions, and you should always have the ability to react quickly. But continually having to worry about the camera in order to keep an eye on every enemy within attack range, while also thinking about parrying, executing attack strings, switching stances, dodging ranged projectiles, and keeping your health up so you don't die on the next hit can sometimes be a little much--your right thumb will be moving back and forth between the analog stick and the face buttons more than usual.When you're fighting in an open, grassy field, and the camera actually pulls back a bit to frame the dozens of enemies closing in on you, Ghost of Tsushima's sword fighting is absolutely sublime. But conditions aren't always perfect. The biggest camera issues regularly arise when fighting in tight spaces indoors, or in cluttered areas like enemy encampments (of which there are many) where tents, fences, crates, and other such environmental objects exist. Too often you will find yourself in a situation where a solid object will be blocking your vision of Jin, your enemies, or more importantly, your enemy's weapons. All enemy attacks have a visible tell, and in the case of stronger, unblockable attacks, they have distinctive red glints moments before they occur. But much like Ogami Itto's Suio-ryu Wave Slicer in the Lone Wolf and Club series (which begins with Itto lowering his sword beneath water--please bear with me here), if you can't see what your enemy is doing with their weapon, there is very little you can do to prevent your imminent death--and that can be incredibly frustrating. To be fair, you'll also kill people without them ever seeing what you're doing. When Mongol invaders turn up on the coasts of Tsushima, Jin and his honour-stricken samurai cohort find that their new enemies don't play by their overly-formal rules of warfare. Jin very quickly learns to accept that he'll need to adopt more deceitful and vicious tactics to combat the overwhelming occupation of the island, meaning he'll have to get used to hiding in the shadows, stabbing people in the back, and using a variety of tools to give himself an unfair advantage--warfare tactics that were reportedly unheard of in 13th-century Japan.A viable option in most scenarios, stealth is a relatively uncomplicated affair in Ghost of Tsushima. Enemies are often placed in convenient locations and are hard of hearing (nearby neutral NPCs will, hilariously, react dramatically to your actions while enemies stand motionless). In the beginning, it also feels basic to a fault--I remember lamenting the fact that there was no way to hide bodies, even though guards are alerted upon discovering them.But as you quickly earn new Ghost Tools to use and upgrade your Tanto blade for quicker takedowns, it becomes clearer that it isn't a stealth game focussed on barely slipping by unnoticed (though there are a number of annoying instant-fail stealth and tailing quests), but one where you want to see how quickly and viciously you can take down everyone in the vicinity. That ended up justifying the inability to hide bodies, on top of explaining why Jin's footsteps are silent to begin with, and how he managed to already be a fearless climbing master. Even after I had completed the game's main quest, I gained a lot of enjoyment from using the remaining enemy encampments as playgrounds to terrorize soldiers. I'd get creative with distraction tools, use more environmental kills, turn enemies against one another with hallucinogenic darts, and hone my super long-range grenade throwing arm from the safety of a dark rooftop I clambered onto with a grappling hook.Ghost of Tsushima's story hits hard in the game's third and final act, and ends in spectacular fashion. It left me with the same kinds of strong emotions I felt at the end of all my favourite samurai film epics, and had me eager to watch them all again. The game hits a lot of fantastic cinematic highs, and those ultimately lift it above the trappings of its familiar open-world quest design and all the innate weaknesses that come with it--but those imperfections and dull edges are definitely still there. Ghost of Tsushima is at its best when you're riding your horse and taking in the beautiful world on your own terms, armed with a sword and a screenshot button, allowing the environmental cues and your own curiosity to guide you. It's not quite a Criterion classic, but a lot of the time it sure looks like one.Ghost Of Tsushima is featured as one of the best PS5 games.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"
Ghost of Tsushima,Ian Walker,Kotaku,https://kotaku.com/ghost-of-tsushima-the-kotaku-review-1844368841,"Ghost of Tsushima is a game of compulsion. Like most open-world adventures, everything is designed to get you to explore what’s over the next hill or across that nearby river. The map is peppered with question marks, many of which surround towns and temples in which you meet allies and upgrade equipment. Helpful diversions like hot springs and fox dens have obvious environmental tells. The wind, a major contributor to the game’s overall aesthetic, literally guides you to objectives. But there’s a big difference between scouring a map to completion and actually having a good time, no matter how obsessive a person you may be.The story opens with Japan on the brink of war. A small group of samurai have gathered on a Tsushima beachhead to repel an invading Mongol force led by Khotun Khan, a fictional descendant of Genghis and Kublai Khan. While the Mongols attacked Japan on multiple occasions, Ghost of Tsushima liberally combines various historical and cultural artifacts for an entirely new narrative. As was the case in the late 13th century, the samurai find themselves unprepared to deal with the invaders’ overwhelming military tactics and get almost completely annihilated.Ghost of Tsushima puts you in control of Jin Sakai, one of the island’s last remaining samurai. A half-dead Jin is pulled from the battlefield by a wandering thief named Yuna, only to rush off in an attempt to free his captured uncle. Jin makes it his mission to save his home from the invaders, who have wasted no time in running roughshod over Tsushima as a prelude to their attack on the Japanese mainland. For the player, this translates to random battles throughout the countryside and liberating villages occupied by the Mongols, sometimes with Jin’s allies but mostly on your own.Jin is a blank slate in the early hours of Ghost of Tsushima, with only brief flashbacks to his time learning from his uncle as any indication of who he is under his gruff exterior. As an idealized image of the samurai warrior caste that existed in Japan at the time, he spends a lot of time worrying about the dichotomy of honor and shame. But it soon becomes abundantly clear that Jin must adopt new tactics, even those he views as “dishonorable,” to liberate Tsushima, adding a thin layer of internal strife to the more overt conflict against the Mongols.This aspect of Ghost of Tsushima gave me pause when developer Sucker Punch Productions showed off early previews. Samurai have been extensively mythologized in modern times, reimagining what was essentially the paramilitary arm of a system of feudal land ownership as noble, superhuman dispensers of justice. Before playing the game, I imagined this stereotypical concept would tie into some weird, Mass Effect-esque morality system by which the main character would vacillate between “honor” and “shame” depending on how he approached every situation.Thankfully, that’s not the case, even if the game’s narrative tunnel-visions on the concept. There’s no penalty for approaching battles in Ghost of Tsushima stealthily, which Jin considers a violation of samurai code. You don’t get locked out of any skill trees or storylines depending on how you decide to fight. While Jin is forced to take a more stealthy approach for both tutorial and narrative reasons early on, there’s also nothing stopping you from proudly walking into an enemy encampment and challenging dozens of Mongols to a straight-up fight. Sure, the best approach will always be a mixture of traditional katana skills and more “underhanded” tools like smoke bombs and firecrackers, but the game never punishes you for living out your own personal version of Seven Samurai.That enduring image of a lone warrior surrounded by foes becomes a neat gameplay mechanic in Ghost of Tsushima. When approaching a group of enemies, Jin can call out to them with a challenge for one-on-one combat against their strongest fighter. Here, the game asks you to hold the Triangle button and keep a close eye on your opponent. When they make a move, that’s your cue to release the button, which causes Jin to unsheathe his sword and unleash a deadly, one-hit kill. By the end of the game, a combination of skills and armor made it so I could slice through five enemies in a row before actually starting a battle, which proved to be a boon for some of the more difficult dust-ups.Ghost of Tsushima’s swordplay is basic and engaging, a mixture of light and heavy attacks, parries, and dodges, tied to specific buttons or button combos. The combat system is very easy to grasp if you’ve played any recent video game, perhaps as a way to indicate, through gameplay, that Jin has been learning to fight with a katana since he was a child. As the game goes on, you learn various stances—combat styles that you can shift into at will—by observing and killing Mongol generals. Stances are meant to deal with different types of enemies: The stone stance, for instance, is better suited to taking down swordsmen, whereas the water stance’s flow of bludgeoning strikes is perfect for decimating shields. These stances, much like the rest of Jin’s repertoire, can be improved with skill points earned from defeating enemies and completing missions to unlock more combo strings and increase damage.The “ghost” in Ghost of Tsushima refers to Jin’s transformation from a rigid samurai warrior into a guerrilla vigilante willing to do anything to save his home. Where a samurai might focus entirely on his katana and bow, the covert tactics Jin learns over the course of the campaign give him access to a multitude of more subtle weaponry. This starts out with some basic kunai, which can be thrown to break an opponent’s guard from a distance, but quickly expands to include tools like smoke bombs, explosives, and even wind chimes that draw enemies’ attention. Jin’s most important tool, however, is his tanto, a short blade that allows him to perform quick, violent assassinations from the shadows. It’s rare to enter a fight where you’re not vastly outnumbered, so it’s best to balance the scales as much as possible from the relative comfort of stealth. The only time where stealth really feels required is when the Mongols have taken hostages. If an enemy spots you, they’ll start to cut down prisoners unless you can stop them.These two aspects of Jin’s arsenal combine to make every battle in Ghost of Tsushima fluid, evolving affairs. While you might initially sneak into a Mongol encampment, one wrong move can turn the mission into an all-out brawl against the camp’s entire garrison. I usually found myself picking off high-priority targets like bruisers with medieval shotguns and explosive-throwing support troops with my bow before wading into battle, where smart usage of my stances were key to surviving. Eventually, the Mongols begin to employ the services of animals like hunting dogs and hawks, which can sniff you out or spot you from above. I never found myself tiring of the basic flow of combat, but I quickly got so strong that stealthy approaches were just a waste of time when there weren’t any hostages to protect. Why assassinate Mongols when I could just walk up, challenge them to a duel, and mop up the stragglers?Besides combat, much of the game is dedicated to exploring the island’s lush environments. Jin strides across vast fields of flowers, the muck and mire of swamplands, and even the icy northern reaches of Tsushima during his adventure. At one point, he dropped his hand to feel the foliage as I raced along on a horse, mimicking my exact desire in that moment. Tsushima also features a weather system that, while not offering much apart from rain storms and rolling fog, gives the beautiful scenery an additional coat of aesthetic flair. Over the course of the game, Jin can learn songs on his flute that change the weather at will, which doesn’t really mean anything mechanically but makes for a fun way to customize your experience.Ghost of Tsushima has an almost insatiable desire to remind you of its influences through its visuals. Each mission opens with a title card that draws inspiration from old samurai films. An optional black-and-white visual filter is literally named after legendary director Akira Kurosawa but imparts the game with none of the charm or humanity for which his films are known. Important duels are preceded by a lengthy, tension-building cutscene that ultimately functioned as a minute or so to check my phone while waiting for it to play out for the tenth time. Every attempt at infusing Tsushima with these cribbed details feels like a wink and a nudge for recognition rather than true homage.Ghost of Tsushima fills its expanses with multiple diversions. Tall, white flags indicate the presence of a bamboo strike mini-game, which asks you to quickly tap out increasingly difficult button sequences to increase Jin’s resolve meter. In combat, this meter allows you to heal, use special techniques like a series of devastating slashes that homes in on opponents, and even revive yourself. Hot springs can be found beneath trees with orange blossoms, giving Jin a chance to decompress and extending his health bar. Swarms of fireflies mean a fox den is nearby, the denizen of which will lead you to a special shrine that lets you carry more charms, accessories with bonuses that range from simple stat boosts to more interesting mechanics like regaining arrows on a headshot. While it’s fun to listen to Jin’s internal thoughts while at the hot spring and to pet the foxes after their guidance, I never found myself excited to see one of these landmarks on the horizon. They were merely there to complete for a reward, a far cry from the dynamic intensity of battle.""Press R2 to compose haiku.""Open-world samurai simulatorFluid combat, gorgeous landscapes, charming side charactersTedious missions, uninspired protagonistSucker Punch ProductionsPlayStation 4July 17, 202055+ hours to finish the story and 100% the mapMost of Ghost of Tsushima’s activities exist simply to reward you rather than offer any meaningful experience. The layer of Japanese aesthetics barely hides the fact that the world is just there to be mindlessly mined for resources. It feels very weird to save a peasant from a group of Mongol soldiers, only to have them turn around and reward Jin with whatever meager possessions they were able to hide away. The game also has no problem with allowing you to raid homesteads for materials like iron and leather, which can then be used to upgrade your gear. Jin is the head of his clan, an aristocratic warrior who never wanted for anything in his life. Why is he so eager to squeeze every last resource from the people he’s supposed to be protecting? Life was hard before the Mongols arrived, and now villages and farms are burning. Those supplies would be much more useful in attending to refugees rather than a man whose sole ambition is reinstating the power structure that enforced these hardships in the first place.Jin isn’t sympathetic or interesting enough to care about. Any growth he shows over the course of the game deals entirely with his approach to warfare, rather than the imbalances within the society he seeks to protect or even his own responsibility for maintaining them. When a friend from his childhood betrays him, for instance, Jin does very little personal inventory about how he might have contributed to the turncoat’s view of the world, instead focusing on a quest for revenge that could have been entirely prevented with a little bit of compassion.The story’s saving grace involves the multi-part side missions that focus on Jin’s allies. Many of these missions follow a similar pattern that usually ends with just another battle, but the characters Jin recruits are so compelling and charming that it makes up for any predictable gameplay decisions. In one mission, Jin finds himself assisting an aging warrior named Lady Masako in finding the people who conspired to murder her entire family amidst the Mongol invasion. Her quest for revenge forces Jin to come to grips with his own anger, and at one point they even come to blows when he stops her from carrying out an arguably more justified form of the revenge he himself seeks against Khotun Khan. Another side mission sees Jin meeting an old archery mentor, Sensei Ishikawa, to help him find his star pupil. Ishikawa’s relationship with his student mirrors Jin’s own relationship with his uncle, giving Jin an outside perspective on his struggle between the honor taught to him by his family and what must be done to defeat the invaders.Despite (or perhaps because of) Ghost of Tsushima’s reliance on combat to drive many of its set pieces, the game’s best mission requires almost no combat. At various points in the game, Jin learns of local legends that lead to great rewards, like a robe that improves your archery skills or the ability to light your katana on fire. The latter requires climbing a massive mountain, atop which supposedly sits a meteor with the ability to imbue blades with flames. While this would be dangerous in and of itself, a snowstorm threatens to freeze Jin before he makes it to the summit. The mission, then, revolves around navigating treacherous mountain paths while making sure to find sporadic campfires before Jin succumbs to the cold. The climbing mechanics are so barebones that they barely warrant a mention elsewhere, but in the swirling vortex of the blizzard, learning how to spot footholds and places to attach Jin’s grappling hook become vital. I won’t ruin what you find at the top, but the journey was enough to make the quest for a burning blade one of my favorite parts of Tsushima. I just wish the game offered more of these moments.Ghost of Tsushima is pretty as heck—sporadic capturing left me with almost 50 GB worth of screenshots and short video clips to sift through—but at its core, it’s just another open-world game. I found myself audibly sighing every time I crested a hill towards a mystery objective only to find another fox to follow or another haiku to compose. These diversions, while unique at first glance, proved to just be busy work as time wore on. I was so strong by the end of the game—filling up every skill tree is easy if you ignore the main story and just explore for a bit—that I didn’t even bother using stealth tactics for the last third. I don’t think I even died after the first few hours. There’s so little to get excited about in Tsushima once the initial wonder of the wind physics and lush environments wears off that the only thing that kept me going was my own innate desire to fill out the entire map. And that can only hold someone’s interest for so long."
Ghost of Tsushima,Mike Williams,USgamer,https://www.usgamer.net/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-review,"Your land has been invaded by the Mongols and there’s only one way to reclaim it: war crimes. Ghost of Tsushima puts you in the role of Jin Sakai, one of the last surviving samurai on Tsushima Island following the invasion of the Mongol army. It’s a story about embedded belief systems and the willingness to bend that code to fight back against an overwhelming enemy. It opens with a beach invasion where the samurai are summarily cut down by the invaders. You meet our antagonist, Khotun Khan - grandson of Ghengis, completely made up for this game - who is challenged to a duel by one of Tsushima’s strongest warriors. As he stands ready to fight, Khotun shows the Japanese warriors that he doesn’t play by their rules in a horrific showcase of barbarism. This sets the tone for the rest of the game as you attempt to push the Mongols back by facing them on their level, becoming the Ghost. 




Watch on YouTube    
This shift from samurai to Ghost begins almost immediately. And while the game has some smart ways to portray this transformation - like how your increased cruelty is reflected in the behaviour of your horse - it’s too brisk to feel impactful. One minute you’re calling people out for honourable duels and the next you’re stabbing them as they sleep. Ghost of Tsushima attempts to moralise over this shift, but there’s no escaping your fate. As a player, the only thing going through your mind will be how to take out the enemy as efficiently as possible. A samurai is trained from a young age to keep their emotions in check, which is fitting because Ghost of Tsushima barely made me feel anything at all. It doesn’t help that the story is so sparse, bogged down by busywork.  You clear its three regions like you’re ticking off a to-do list. You compose haikus to get new bandanas that don’t have an impact outside of looking a little different. You follow foxes to shrines - 49 of them - to upgrade your charms, which slightly tweak your ability to take and deal damage. You chop bamboo by following button prompts. You take hot spring baths to increase your health. Sometimes you find a new hat or a sheath for your sword. There are Assassin’s Creed-style climbing puzzles. Main missions fare a little better, though these are plagued with archaic design issues too. Insta-fail stealth missions? Yep. Tail a man at a certain distance? You bet. A bit where you’re stripped of all your gear and you have to use the barebones stealth? Of course. Red barrels you can ignite with arrows? Damn straight. Missions where you can walk slightly out of bounds and trigger a game over? Yeppers. Outside of that, you’re either clearing out Mongol compounds or having a one-on-one duel with a boss. The thing that carries Ghost of Tsushima is its world and the way you move around it. Instead of a minimap, you swipe up on the controller’s touchpad, triggering a gust of wind that leads you to your next objective. Pampas grass, trees, the string on your bandana - everything is in motion when the wind blows. It’s gorgeous. It keeps your eyes fixed on this stunning world when you’re exploring, rather than a map in the corner of the screen. Fog hangs on distant mountains, golden light breaks through a canopy of brightly coloured trees as leaves rain down, murmurations of birds dancing overhead. In the night, fireflies  bathe graveyards in a peaceful glow. Gnarled black forests, golden woodlands, poppy fields, frozen tundras, impossibly large fields - this is a world that begs you to dive into it. It’s just a shame there’s barely anything worth exploring it for. The wind might guide you, but you’re still setting waypoints on a map and clearing up icons that represent tedious, repetitive content. If you visit all the baths, your reward is the option to run around fighting the Mongols while wearing nothing but a towel. The grind isn’t worth the effort, and you’ll likely have the story finished before you unlock these daft extras anyway.Then there’s the believability of that world, which breaks when Jin phases through thin bamboo trees. Ghost of Tsushima, indeed. Sometimes you stealthily kill a man and he falls in a canned animation, poking out over a ledge onto some invisible death bed - bodies don’t have physics upon death. If you creep up behind a man who’s crouched, he will politely stand up so you can stab him in the neck and play the animation out. That stealth is old school as well. You can hide in long grass or behind cover, but there’s not really a cover system - Jin doesn’t interact with walls. You can’t even kill over cover or around corners - you have to get right next to an enemy unless you’re jumping down from above. Even if you’re hanging below an enemy, you can’t pull them over the edge for a kill - Jin instead jumps up and slashes at them. Later on you unlock the ability to chain up to three stealth kills together, and you can also assassinate people through screen doors, but those are the only calculations you’re making as you clear out compounds: how can I get these three enemies together for a chain kill? Will that guy pass under that wire so I can jump down from above? Will anyone see? Of course, you can engage at range too. There’s a short bow for enemies with no armour and a heavy bow for those with helmets. There’s a satisfying feeling of heft to the shots. But again, you’re usually just using it to thin the edges of a camp so you can clear out the middle without archers on watchtowers spotting you from their overwatch position. Actual combat fares a little better. It’s simple, but effective. Swords feel deadly and action is instant - important for an action game. You can interrupt swings to pull your sword up for a parry. It’s no button masher. You switch between four different stances to combat different enemy types, and there’s a mid-game ability that makes you feel unstoppable, accompanied by a cool visual trick. I won’t spoil it here, but that’s when limbs and heads start flying. I also have to give a shout to the way you can manually sheath your sword with a little swipe of the touchpad, drawing your finger across as Jin flicks the blood from its edge or wipes it across his sleeve. It’s almost ritualistic. The one-on-one duels are Ghost of Tsushima at its best. Here it forgets about those four stances being used for enemy archetypes and you’re free to switch between them all, stringing your own combos together to bring down a dangerous enemy. It also helps that these automatically lock you on to your foe, whereas fights against groups have no lock on at all, sometimes leaving you swinging your sword into the air like you’re the one who’s scared of ghosts. As you lean into your Japanese Batman persona, the Mongols become more and more terrified of you. Sometimes you’ll kill one of their allies and their friends will stumble backwards, crawling away, opening them up for a sword through the belly. Sometimes they’ll down tools and leg it. Walking up to an archer, sword raised above your head, sidestepping and deflecting incoming arrows - it’s in these action sequences where Ghost of Tsushima excels. It has its moments, but like Jin Sakai in the opening hours, the past holds it back. It’s Open World: The Video Game. It’s far too easy, too - the lack of consequence for failure makes it feel like you’re just going through the motions. If you’ll excuse the wind-based pun, it’s a breeze. While playing it, I often found my mind wandering. By the third and final act, I just wanted it to be over. Like the samurai, Ghost of Tsushima feels like a relic of a bygone era.

If you thought Sucker Punch Productions’ move from creating Sly Cooper to making Infamous was brave, just wait until you play GHOST OF TSUSHIMA. Progressing from Second Son’s modern Seattle setting with its obnoxious, rebellious protagonist to Ghost of Tsushima’s ancient Japanese backdrop and its honor-driven main character, was a very bold direction to go in. It could have spelled disaster for this Sony developer, breaking the combo of so many fantastic first-party PlayStation exclusives.Fortunately, Ghost of Tsushima suffers no such fate, fitting together multiple polished elements that make for a journey worth experiencing. This is the Game Revolution review.Controlling Jin Sakai, a Samurai warrior, the player has the primary task of driving away Mongol invaders. This hostile force uses tactics that Jin and his Samurai brethren haven’t seen before and are unable to defend against. It’s soon made clear that the Samurai’s tradition of maintaining one’s honor and respecting the enemy in battle is not going to save Tsushima, which causes Jin to venture down a different path.While I expected to be told the story of a legendary warrior who goes around beating everything before ultimately coming out on top, I wasn’t expecting the additional conflict of honor versus dishonor to be so powerful. It’s done really well and makes for some emotional moments that hit surprisingly hard.There aren’t many twists or turns in the plot, which in a way plays into the game’s favor, as there is a sense of inevitability in Jin’s actions and what they will ultimately cost him.I spent 30 hours with Ghost of Tsushima before writing this review. It took me 25 hours to beat the main campaign with a few key side missions, which are surprisingly great and provide a good chunk of backstory and lore, before finishing off my playthrough with five hours of exploring and making use of the feature-rich Photo Mode.The island of Tsushima is presented beautifully. It is honestly breathtaking at times, with a vibrancy and high contrast that truly makes you feel part of an ancient Japanese legend. The weather effects add to the drama, with thunder and lightning being the biggest highlight as it crashes down. Environments are varied, but regardless of whether it’s sunny or snowy, it’s always a treat for the eyes and the PS4’s Share Button.This is especially the case when playing on PS4 Pro, which enjoys “Better Frame-Rate” and “Higher Resolution” modes. While I’m partial to smoother gameplay, I found myself settling on the Higher Resolution option. Despite being locked to 30 FPS, the stutter-free gameplay made it easy to enjoy alongside the boosted resolution.In addition to the Share Button, Sucker Punch has once again made great use of the DualShock 4’s Touchpad. The developer has basically mapped four additional prompts to the touchpad which activate by swiping in a specific direction. To call upon the wind for guidance, for example, you simply swipe up. It’s a small thing, but it’s appreciated.Sucker Punch has also done an amazing job of limiting distractions in Ghost of Tsushima‘s open world. HUD elements are unobtrusive, with a minimalistic approach that provides essential information without pulling you out of the experience. The highlight here is the wind, which guides you to the next objective. There’s no waypoint, you just follow the breeze.While it can sometimes be tricky to know when to maneuver around hills or water, the wind mechanic usually works well to keep you moving in the correct direction, while still being able to look around and appreciate the rich visuals, rather than being locked in and focused on a quest marker.The optional Japanese voice acting further adds to the immersion, which I urge every player to try (with English subtitles). It’s absolutely the recommended way to play, further immersing you into the world. Couple this with the epic soundtrack which really shines during the larger battles and you really do feel like part of the action.While Sucker Punch has made an effort to remove distractions, there are some animation hiccups that can be jarring. NPCs can randomly fall over and continue to fall over until they eventually stumble into the correct spot. This happened only a handful of times during my playthrough, but it’s there. Enemy AI can also pull off some funky animations in narrower areas, but again the issue is rare.Ghost of Tsushima allows you to approach most missions in two different ways. There’s the honorable path of heading straight for your enemy and fighting them in a fair duel, and then there’s the not-so-honorable path of carrying out assassinations from the shadows.There’s no morality meter or anything like that, which I think is a good thing. Instead of a video game mechanic forcing you to choose a “best path,” you can instead focus on what you enjoy most and leveling up abilities that complement that playstyle.While your character won’t grow horns or have his sword swapped out for a red lightsaber when you commit too many dishonorable acts, you’re still made to feel guilty about using poison and other shady tactics through the dialogue and the overarching themes explored in the story.Sometimes it can seem impossible to win fights through standard combat, especially on Hard, forcing a more stealthy approach. It’s interesting to have the player consciously make the choice to give up a difficult, yet honorable, win just get the mission done by any means necessary.Mission structure is quite basic, as you wipe out group of enemies after group of enemies, sometimes backed up by friendlies. Thankfully, what would be repetitive gameplay is made more exciting through the combat system and the rate at which you unlock new abilities.Jin has four different stances to master, each of which is tailored to countering a specific type of enemy. With groups being made up of many different enemy types, the player has to be constantly switching between stances in a kind of frenetic game of rock, paper, scissors. It works really well, giving Jin the ability to cut through multiple tough opponents with well-timed counters, all the while keeping an eye out for incoming long-range attacks. It ends up looking like a sort of dance, which is super satisfying to pull off without any flaws.Maintain that flawless assault and you’ll earn the Ghost Stance. Once unlocked through the story, this allows you to immediately one-hit-kill three enemies with a stylish flash of red. It’s as wonderful as it sounds and can turn the tide in particularly tricky encounters.Resolve acts as “MP” which is spent on healing and abilities. These abilities come in useful when trying to handle a group of enemies or a single tough opponent. Deciding how and when to spend that Resolve can often mean the difference between winning and losing fights.What initially seems like simple combat actually has a surprising layer of complexity that the player is gradually introduced to. As you level up and spend Technique Points on new moves and tools, you become better equipped at handling multiple foes. You also improve your stealth with a grappling hook that allows you to quickly ascend above the enemy. You can then scout and form a plan. Both playstyles evolve over time, which keeps the gameplay feeling fresh.What’s more, you don’t need to worry about being the “right level” for a new area, with no forced grinding or anything tedious like that. You can choose to follow golden birds that helpfully lead you to health boosts, minor missions, and other goodies, but you can also easily ignore them. If you just want to roll through the main story, you can absolutely just go for it.Oh, and you can collect items while riding on horseback, which further cuts away any animation padding and keeps you moving!After you’ve spent a good 20+ hours finishing the main story, there will still be plenty of side content to check out. The Mythic Tales are the highlights here, allowing you to learn powerful abilities and earn awesome armor rewards. Then there are the missions tied to key characters, which award you with valuable resources and earn you more Technique Points to spend on new moves and equipment. Finally, there are the more repetitive missions, which have you killing bad guys to save homes and villages, as you slowly work to wipe out the Mongol forces from the island.There is a lot to do here and I think Ghost of Tsushima earns its $60 through the main story alone. However, for those who need a serious hour count to justify the purchase, there are plenty of enemy camps to wipe out and collectibles to find that will easily push you to 50+ hours and beyond.Ghost of Tsushima is a worthy addition to the roster of must-play PS4 exclusives that have kept players loyal to the console. Though I play primarily on PC, I’m always eager to boot up my PS4 Pro for the latest exclusive to witness astonishing visuals, satisfying gameplay, and a compelling story that is only available on the Sony system. It’s games like this that sell the hardware.Shifting the focus to ancient history was always going to be a challenge, especially with competition from the likes of Assassin’s Creed and its epic scale, but I think Sucker Punch has delivered a more refined, focused experience that offers enough content without the risk of overwhelming its audience. And as there are no microtransactions infesting its mechanics and influencing its balance, Ghost of Tsushima is honorable in its approach and deserves to be played.Ghost of Tsushima was reviewed on PS4 Pro with code provided by the publisher.8Mack is slowly grinding his way to Level 100.

Ghost of Tsushima,Chris Carter,Destructoid,https://www.destructoid.com/stories/review-ghost-of-tsushima-595478.phtml,"darkI’m just going to come out and say it: Sucker Punch is underrated as hell.I know. Infamous got a lot of love back in the day, but as far as the sequels (and the standalone games) are concerned, not enough love. Also, Sly Cooper remains one of the greatest mascot treasures in all of gaming, and you can’t convince me otherwise.But if all of those didn’t manage to put Sucker Punch in the same conversation as a lot of other studios, Ghost of Tsushima will be the tipping point.Ghost of Tsushima (PS4 [reviewed with a PS4 Pro])Developer: Sucker PunchPublisher: SonyReleased: July 17, 2020MSRP: $59.99Ghost of Tsushima wowed me from its opening moments. I can’t stress enough: this is one of the most incredible-looking games I’ve ever seen, and not just from a technical standpoint. Ghost is somehow moody, yet idyllic. Bloody and dangerous, yet calm and serene.Waking up on the battlefield of Tsushima to find his people massacred at the hands of an invading Mongol army, samurai (and noble) Jin Sakai is foisted into a good old fashioned revenge tale. While it seems like a surface-level conflict, the setup is frankly genius, allowing the narrative to blossom alongside of the player. Jin morphs into the persona of the “Ghost,” the potential savior of Japan, but his lineage provides us with a firm background that informs his character’s motivations.Watching it all unfold with Japanese audio (English is available) and in an optional black and white “Kurosawa mode” filter is glorious. Sucker Punch pays homage to classic Japanese cinema throughout the game’s 30-ish-hour runtime.That filter — and the rest of the game really — sings in HDR, right down to details like individual leaves cascading across the screen. Amazingly, Sucker Punch also kept the load times down to a minimum, as they range from five to ten seconds (sometimes less) when transitioning between fast-travel locations. PS4 Pro owners have the option to swap between a performance-based mode and a visual-first toggle, but I kept it on the latter the entire time and didn’t notice any major framerate drops. In many ways, coupled with the fast load times, it feels like the culmination of current generation tech.While this is a “call your horse with a button and roam the open world” game, Ghost of Tsushima allows its personality to augment that seemingly rote framework. It starts out a bit clunky, with a limited moveset and light traversal options, but once you get into the main loop, everything comes together.You know that boring breadcrumb trail that’s in most games? Well Ghost reinvents it, with a flowing wind effect that points you in the right direction while wildly altering the environment in front of your eyes. I’ll never get tired of it and now I want it in pretty much every game: it’s tough going back to busy objective markers that gum up the HUD.The rhythm of combat is also a sight to behold. Resolve (think of it as MP) fuels your healing and your skills, allowing an interesting balance between defense and offense. The crux of the action is housed within the timing-based parry system, as well as the need to dodge unblockable attacks (reflected by a blue and red glint, respectively). It’s the standard for a lot of action romps, but I respect it, especially after it opens up.Ghost of Tsushima slowly ramps as you acquire new stances, dancing between them to counter enemies who sport shields, spears, and swords. You also manage to feel powerful at the start even with a low health bar and no tricks, as the parry system provides you with most of the tools you need to survive. Adding in extra ninja stuff, more stealth options, dodging, and brute-force techniques help you customize Jin’s playstyle to your liking, though.Like the small open-world nuances, combat blossoms over time. The insta-kill standoff sequences are fitting given the cinematic samurai theme, but are also functional ways to approach combat head-on if you aren’t big on the whole stealth thing (very few missions require a “no alarm” stealth parameter).Outside of fighting, you’ll also find open-world locations that grant bonuses that require you to compose a haiku first. Or reflect on certain story beats while bathing in hot springs. It’s all very unique and helps break the chains of most open-world checklist garbage. Sucker Punch embraces this philosophy inside and out, as the HUD follows a minimalist design by default. Ghost of Tsushima kept me interested throughout the course of its entire campaign, but there are plenty of story-based side missions and extras to uncover. The map isn’t obnoxiously big — though there are a lot of collectibles — and the genuinely speedy fast-travel system helps move things along. The dual audio and multiple difficulty settings also nicely tee up extra replays.With Ghost of Tsushima under its belt, Sucker Punch deserves to be in the same conversation as Insomniac, Naughty Dog, and Sony Santa Monica. If this generation is to wrap up soon, it’s fitting that it’ll end with Tsushima: one of its most beautiful games thus far. [This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]SuperbA hallmark of excellence. There may be flaws, but they are negligible and won't cause massive damage.

Ghost of Tsushima,Paul Tassi,Forbes,https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2020/07/27/ghost-of-tsushima-review-ps4-the-surprise-of-the-generation/#e1f0b335f8a0,"Ghost of TsushimaWe are only a few months away from the launch of the PlayStation 5, and yet here we are, with Sony releasing all-time great exclusives in the final months of the PS4’s life cycle.The Last of Us Part 2, despite many agreeing that it’s a phenomenal game, has been a hotbed of debate since its release. Ghost of Tsushima? It has been a far, far less controversial title, liked by critics, but flat-out beloved by fans. And it’s easy to see why, as it’s a game that is genuinely impossible not to like with how much it gets right.Sucker Punch is best known for its Infamous games, a solid series of superhero outings for PlayStation, albeit no one was usually listing them among Sony’s best in a given generation. But once again, Sony has allowed a developer to spread its wings and do something wildly outside their usual box, and we have gone from a superhero cityscape to a samurai open world, and Sucker Punch has absolutely nailed every aspect of the landing here.The game follows Jin, the nephew of the samurai lord of Tsushima, who finds his home island invaded and decimated by a Mongol horde. His uncle captured, his armor broken and his spirit crushed, Jin must crawl his way back to assembling a fighting force to retake the island, relying on the few warriors that survived the massacre, along with turning himself into a mythical legend that inspires the people of Tsushima and strikes fear into the hearts of the Mongols, “the Ghost.”Ghost of TsushimaIt is impossible to talk about Ghost of Tsushima without first mentioning its beauty. I have made the case that Ghost of Tsushima may be the most beautiful game ever made, and given the past generation of releases, that is not something I say lightly. It’s not just about photorealism. In fact, environments and characters in games like God of War or The Last of Us are certainly more graphically intensive. But it’s the art design here, the gorgeous, sweeping landscapes of rich, vibrant colors, and the use of sunlight, wind and weather effects to make practically every frame of the game something you want to snap a photo of. And the game lets you do just that, with one of the best-in-business photo modes, which is how you’re seeing the gorgeous snaps threaded all throughout this piece. Rarely have I found a game where I just constantly stand there in awe of a given landscape, and Tsushima elicits this feeling roughly once every ten minutes, depending on where your mission takes you.The beauty extends past the world, however, and into the combat.I am in awe of how enjoyable Sucker Punch has made combat in Ghost of Tsushima, a fine balance between the ultra-hard parrying and dodging of a Nioh or Dark Souls, but challenging enough to be more than a simple hack and slash. A wide variety of armor sets and charms, paired with traditional parrying and dodging, paired with special ghost weapons, paired with shifting combat stances and special moves, all equals one of the most robust, engaging combat systems I’ve ever seen.Ghost of TsushimaEverything about combat feels excellent. From the first time you win a standoff with a one hit kill, to when you’ve perfected your stagger build that allows you to win 1 v 6s in open combat with ease. If there is one criticism you can make of Ghost of Tsushima it’s that it is rather long and can get repetitive. And yet the thing is, combat is so good that you don’t really care if the 85th side mission you’re doing is to go to a farm and kill 12 Ronin because combat is just that damn fun. I am constantly reminded of how Insomniac mastered Spider-Man combat in that game, making you feel more like that hero than ever before. Sucker Punch has done the same here, but with a samurai. This is exactly how I wanted my overpowered, hyper-skilled samurai to feel, a whirlwind of death and destruction, rather than someone constantly trying to avoid getting one shot in more difficult games. As such, Ghost of Tsushima can feel a bit easy compared to rivals, but the power fantasy is worth the trade, if you ask me.Finally, a third pillar of the game is one I was not expecting, an incredibly well-written, emotionally impactful story. Jin’s journey is fascinating, as we are not going down the well-worn road of “should heroes kill?” here, but rather the story is one about honor, and a constant conflict between Jin and his uncle over the tactics they should be using to fight the Mongols. His uncle seems to believe that facing your enemy head on is the honorable move, even if you lose the island and its people are slaughtered. Jin discovers he’s willing to make compromises if it means saving lives, sacrificing his good name by stabbing enemies in the back or poisoning their armies if need be.But it’s not just Jin’s story that’s gripping. We have a number of lengthy side quests that are fascinating, mostly based around Jin and his allies. The most harrowing I saw (mild spoilers) is a warrior monk who begins his journey saying he never wants to swing his weapon in hate. And by the time his story ends, he’s burning Mongols alive and we are left to wonder what our murderous influence has done to the man.Ghost of TsushimaEven the minor stories are memorable. I found one side mission where a group of townsfolk were acting very weird, and said they didn’t want my protection. I eventually discovered they had traded all their women away to the Mongols in exchange for the safety of the cowering men. I rescued the women, who decided to leave the village and live on their own, and executed the town leader as an example to the others. The entire mission was me probably only killing like, eight bad guys, and yet it hit me hard. There are at least a dozen other missions I could say produced similar reactions, including many that nearly moved me to tears that I won’t get into, lest you not be able to experience them fresh for yourself.As I said earlier, I do think Ghost of Tsushima goes on a bit too long. The third section of the map especially feels like overkill, and it’s so barren you do have to wonder if it was sort of an afterthought, and I’m not sure it needed to exist at all, as it makes the game kind of feel like it runs out of steam by the end (though the conclusions of various storylines that occur there are all good). I just would have shaved a little bit off the top of this game, similar to what I said about The Last of Us. I really just think many 30 hour games need to be more like 20-25, as it’s like watching a TV show you love, yet you get exhausted by it when you realize it has say, a 35 episode season.That said, I’ll be damned if I don’t want to return to that world down the road, perhaps in DLC (a bit unlikely in this era) or almost certainly in a sequel, given the success of the game. From the trailers, we always knew Ghost of Tsushima would be pretty. But I was not expecting a combat system this engaging and fun, or a story this gripping and emotional. It is easily one of the best games of the entire PS4 generation, and given its competition, that’s saying something.Score: 9.5/10Follow me on Twitter, YouTube and Instagram.

Ghost of Tsushima,Blake Morse,Shacknews,https://www.shacknews.com/article/119180/ghost-of-tsushima-review-ghostface-killer,"New to Shacknews? Signup for a Free AccountAlready have an account? Login NowSucker Punch's latest game is hoping to be a tour de force of cinematic-inspired samurai action. Does Ghost of Tsushima live up to its expectations? Our review.What is the value of honor? Is living one’s life by a rigid and unbending set of rules, even when that means great sacrifice, truly worth it? What happens when one chooses to abandon tradition and set forth on a new, never before treaded path even if that means losing the honor they once coveted? These are just a few of the questions that Jin Sakai, the protagonist in Sucker Punch’s latest masterpiece, Ghost of Tsushima, must learn for himself as he embarks on an incredible and unexpected journey.Ghost of Tsushima opens with Jin and his fellow samurai defending the shores of their homeland against an invading Mongul horde. Things do not go as planned though and the brave warriors who guard Tsushima are all but destroyed. Jin himself only survives thanks to the efforts of a woman named Yuna who appears to be a thief of some sorts. The two form an unlikely alliance and set off to recruit allies in their quest to liberate Tsushima from the clutches of the malevolent Khotun Khan and his army. In order to liberate his people, Jin will have to make a lot of sacrifices and possibly bring his honor into question.I don’t want to spoil too much of the story because it’s such a delectable, savory meal. Every quest has a story behind it that adds to the game’s mythos. Every decision has a consequence and it all weaves into a wonderful tapestry that makes Tsushima feel like a living, breathing world. The friends and allies you make along the way have their own stories to tell and they’re just as compelling as the main plot. I have to admit, a few quests hit close to home with their themes and really worked to connect me emotionally to the game, which is an extremely rare occurrence for me personally.Wandering through the massive world of Ghost of Tsushima is a cavalcade of diversions. Much like Breath of the Wild it’s easy to get distracted from the task at hand by something that catches the corner of your eye and suddenly half an hour has gone by and you don’t remember what you were doing in the first place. Beyond the stories told in the main and side-quests there are an incredible amount of things to keep you from whatever you were doing in the first place.The island of Tsushima is littered head to toe with exploratory distractions. Maybe a fox will pop up and lead you to a shrine, or maybe you’ll have to do some platform puzzling to pray to another shrine, and there’s always a chance you’ll find a bamboo strike to help increase your resolve. Perhaps you’ll stumble upon an area perfect for a moment of meditative haiku writing. No matter what you end up doing, your character will benefit by gaining things like charms that buff your sword, cosmetic skins, or permanent stat increases of some sort. It’s pretty easy to lose track of time while wandering in Ghost of Tsushima because the island is ridiculously gorgeous. Fields full of vibrantly-colored cherry blossoms litter the island and its shores are breathtaking. Even though most of the island is covered in wilderness there’s a ton of variety to every area you end up visiting along your journey. Beyond nature’s beauty, every village, temple, and castle you visit along the way has its own wonders to behold as well.It would be hard to look at a game like this and not make comparisons to the work of acclaimed director Akira Kurosawa and several of his films like The Seven Samurai and Yojimbo as well as his period pieces like Rashomon. Sucker Punch must’ve seen this coming a mile away and decided to include a “Kurosawa Mode” as a visual option. They even went as far as to consult with the director’s estate on it. The results are incredibly accurate to the sharp depth and tone that are prevalent in Kurosawa’s black and white films. It’s a fun addition and can be enjoyable if you’re looking to take cinematic in-game pics or pretend you’re a wandering samurai in one of his films, especially if you put on Japanese audio and English subtitles. However, it can be a hindrance as far as doing things like picking up wildflowers or other items from the environment. There are also a few missions where color is an extremely helpful tool. Still, it’s a nice bonus.Character designs are also totally on point and both the English and Japanese voice actors behind the various roles do a fantastic job with their performances. Like I said earlier, this game has some great emotional gravitas to it, and that wouldn’t come across even half as much without such great deliveries and wonderfully animated characters.While samurai are bound to a rigid code of honor that does not allow them to do things like stab an enemy in the back, desperate times call for desperate measures. Jin will find himself in several situations where something more akin to an Assassin’s Creed approach is more appropriate. Throughout the game, players will have to use stealth to infiltrate enemy strongholds or kill without being seen. The game gives players an ability similar to AC's eagle vision that lets them track enemies while trying to remain undetected. Players will also get an arsenal of tools to help them such as kunai daggers, smoke bombs, and bells that you can use to distract enemies.Most of the time though, players will also have the option to meet the enemy head-on in combat. There’s usually even an option to challenge your opponents to a face-off duel before diving into a full-on brawl with their allies. Along the way players will be able to unlock new dodging techniques and various sword-fighting stances. The stances end up being a big part of sword-fighting since each of the four main enemy classes (swordsman, spearmen, shieldmen, and brutes) are weak to a certain one. There are also some fantastic one-on-one samurai duels that will put your skills to the test, they’re a real treat and probably one of the most immersive samurai experiences in the game.As you progress you’ll also earn charms to augment your katana with things like buffs to damage or defense, stealth skills, and bow and arrow skills to name a few. Armor and weapons are also upgradable through various merchants, but players will have to collect a lot of supplies such as bamboo, iron, leather, fabrics, flowers, and more in order to afford them. One of the more important tools in combat is the Resolve meter that takes the form of a group circles above the health gauge. Resolve can be used to heal Jin during a fight or pull off some extra-special attacks that are learned as the game progresses. Knowing when to be conservative and when to cut loose with resolve can be key to winning a battle. Players will really have to make use of every resource at their disposal to truly master Ghost of Tsushima’s combat mechanics and be victorious.Overall, the way that the stealth and combat mix together reminded me a lot of the Batman Arkham series in the way that it flows, which isn’t a bad thing at all. However, the combat is far from perfect because of two major flaws. First and foremost, the game suffers from a lack of a true lock-on system. There were far too many times I would be fighting one enemy and another would come up and my focus would shift, or maybe I would be trying to hone in on a particular enemy and suddenly I’m lunging into someone else. And then there’s the camera, which far too often felt like it was another enemy on the field. I found myself constantly spinning the cam not only to focus on the action, but also to keep an eye out for enemies looking to get a cheap hit in.Fortunately though, it’s not tough to overcome these obstacles and really master the combat mechanics. It also helps that Ghost of Tsushima doesn’t really punish you for dying so you never really lose progress. Overall, it does a great job at balancing the challenge and accessible fun factors of what makes a game like this so enjoyable. The traversal mechanics are also extremely polished and actions like leaping from branches, jumping on rooftops, and climbing mountains are very intuitive with the exception of a few hiccups here and there.One thing I just adore about Ghost of Tsushima is the fact that I don’t have to get off my horse when I’m riding to pick up items. Sure, it’s a pet peeve of mine, but after having to hop on and off my horse so damn much in Red Dead Redemption 2, I’m more than happy to be able to grab supplies and plants without breaking my stride as I ride to my next destination. It’s a small thing, but it’s indicative of the attention to detail that Sucker Punch poured into this game.While Ghost of Tsushima has a few of the standard pop-ins and visual glitches that are common to most open-world games this is still one of the most beautiful and fluid titles I’ve ever played. While I did have a few moments of frustration, usually brought on by camera angle issues, they are almost completely forgivable when I look at the overall package. There’s just too much here to like and none of it feels tacked on or a time-filler. It’s wonderfully balanced and doesn’t punish you for needing to attempt something more than once. And, even with the camera working against me, I was able to become a masterful samurai. Perhaps Ghost of Tsushima isn’t a perfect cherry blossom, but it is pretty damn close as far as I’m concerned.This review is based on a PS4 download code provided by the publisher.

					Blake Morse  posted a new article, Ghost of Tsushima review: Ghostface killer 
					Seems to be getting really good reviews. I hope Sony does some kind of backwards compatibility. I'd love to play this on a PS5. 				
					Yeah, I'd be surprised if there isn't already some kind of plan in place to bring this and other last-minute games of this generation to the PS5 in an easy / consumer-friendly way. With Microsoft touting its services and plans already, Sony would be absolutely nuts not to at least have started creating something (if they hadn't come up with it already).				
					Am I high or hasn't Sony said this game and almost every ps4 game will play fine on ps5 				
					They set a requirement that all games released after (I forget the date) have to run as-is on PS5.  Nothing about having to take advantage of PS5 features.  Just that it has to run w/o modification.

					Trending pretty well here now that more reviews showing up:https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/ghost-of-tsushima/critic-reviews  
					You think PC well be coming next year?				
					I hope so. But I don't think any of Sucker Punch's previous games did. 				
					PC only seems to be exclusive to the decima engine games				
					Still, Sony published both games. I was pretty surprised to see H:ZD and DS on PC, so it wouldn't be too much farther a leap for this to make its way too, if Sony is down.				
					And more than published both games, owns Sucker Punch and Guerrilla.				
					Sounds great. I'll buy it 				
					It's nice to see them including a full Japanese language option with subtitles. Most western produced games set in a different location where another spoken language is standard are often English only, same goes for movies and television shows.   
					Although I've read that the Japanese dialogue isn't synced properly to the animations, that could be distracting but it's not uncommon. Plenty of Japanese developed games which offer both Japanese & English voice acting don't usually sync up the English properly.  Still kinda weird here considering the setting and vibe of this one, one would think the Japanese language should be the default for the lip syncing. 				
					Admittedly, it's not perfectly synced, but it wouldn't be in a movie either and it's not really distracting in any way. At least for me it wasn't.				
					That's something they could patch later.  Hopefully they will.

Ghost of Tsushima,Kirk McKeand,VG247,https://www.vg247.com/2020/07/14/ghost-of-tsushima-review/,"Your land has been invaded by the Mongols and there’s only one way to reclaim it: war crimes. Ghost of Tsushima puts you in the role of Jin Sakai, one of the last surviving samurai on Tsushima Island following the invasion of the Mongol army. It’s a story about embedded belief systems and the willingness to bend that code to fight back against an overwhelming enemy. It opens with a beach invasion where the samurai are summarily cut down by the invaders. You meet our antagonist, Khotun Khan - grandson of Ghengis, completely made up for this game - who is challenged to a duel by one of Tsushima’s strongest warriors. As he stands ready to fight, Khotun shows the Japanese warriors that he doesn’t play by their rules in a horrific showcase of barbarism. This sets the tone for the rest of the game as you attempt to push the Mongols back by facing them on their level, becoming the Ghost. 




Watch on YouTube    
This shift from samurai to Ghost begins almost immediately. And while the game has some smart ways to portray this transformation - like how your increased cruelty is reflected in the behaviour of your horse - it’s too brisk to feel impactful. One minute you’re calling people out for honourable duels and the next you’re stabbing them as they sleep. Ghost of Tsushima attempts to moralise over this shift, but there’s no escaping your fate. As a player, the only thing going through your mind will be how to take out the enemy as efficiently as possible. A samurai is trained from a young age to keep their emotions in check, which is fitting because Ghost of Tsushima barely made me feel anything at all. It doesn’t help that the story is so sparse, bogged down by busywork.  You clear its three regions like you’re ticking off a to-do list. You compose haikus to get new bandanas that don’t have an impact outside of looking a little different. You follow foxes to shrines - 49 of them - to upgrade your charms, which slightly tweak your ability to take and deal damage. You chop bamboo by following button prompts. You take hot spring baths to increase your health. Sometimes you find a new hat or a sheath for your sword. There are Assassin’s Creed-style climbing puzzles. Main missions fare a little better, though these are plagued with archaic design issues too. Insta-fail stealth missions? Yep. Tail a man at a certain distance? You bet. A bit where you’re stripped of all your gear and you have to use the barebones stealth? Of course. Red barrels you can ignite with arrows? Damn straight. Missions where you can walk slightly out of bounds and trigger a game over? Yeppers. Outside of that, you’re either clearing out Mongol compounds or having a one-on-one duel with a boss. The thing that carries Ghost of Tsushima is its world and the way you move around it. Instead of a minimap, you swipe up on the controller’s touchpad, triggering a gust of wind that leads you to your next objective. Pampas grass, trees, the string on your bandana - everything is in motion when the wind blows. It’s gorgeous. It keeps your eyes fixed on this stunning world when you’re exploring, rather than a map in the corner of the screen. Fog hangs on distant mountains, golden light breaks through a canopy of brightly coloured trees as leaves rain down, murmurations of birds dancing overhead. In the night, fireflies  bathe graveyards in a peaceful glow. Gnarled black forests, golden woodlands, poppy fields, frozen tundras, impossibly large fields - this is a world that begs you to dive into it. It’s just a shame there’s barely anything worth exploring it for. The wind might guide you, but you’re still setting waypoints on a map and clearing up icons that represent tedious, repetitive content. If you visit all the baths, your reward is the option to run around fighting the Mongols while wearing nothing but a towel. The grind isn’t worth the effort, and you’ll likely have the story finished before you unlock these daft extras anyway.Then there’s the believability of that world, which breaks when Jin phases through thin bamboo trees. Ghost of Tsushima, indeed. Sometimes you stealthily kill a man and he falls in a canned animation, poking out over a ledge onto some invisible death bed - bodies don’t have physics upon death. If you creep up behind a man who’s crouched, he will politely stand up so you can stab him in the neck and play the animation out. That stealth is old school as well. You can hide in long grass or behind cover, but there’s not really a cover system - Jin doesn’t interact with walls. You can’t even kill over cover or around corners - you have to get right next to an enemy unless you’re jumping down from above. Even if you’re hanging below an enemy, you can’t pull them over the edge for a kill - Jin instead jumps up and slashes at them. Later on you unlock the ability to chain up to three stealth kills together, and you can also assassinate people through screen doors, but those are the only calculations you’re making as you clear out compounds: how can I get these three enemies together for a chain kill? Will that guy pass under that wire so I can jump down from above? Will anyone see? Of course, you can engage at range too. There’s a short bow for enemies with no armour and a heavy bow for those with helmets. There’s a satisfying feeling of heft to the shots. But again, you’re usually just using it to thin the edges of a camp so you can clear out the middle without archers on watchtowers spotting you from their overwatch position. Actual combat fares a little better. It’s simple, but effective. Swords feel deadly and action is instant - important for an action game. You can interrupt swings to pull your sword up for a parry. It’s no button masher. You switch between four different stances to combat different enemy types, and there’s a mid-game ability that makes you feel unstoppable, accompanied by a cool visual trick. I won’t spoil it here, but that’s when limbs and heads start flying. I also have to give a shout to the way you can manually sheath your sword with a little swipe of the touchpad, drawing your finger across as Jin flicks the blood from its edge or wipes it across his sleeve. It’s almost ritualistic. The one-on-one duels are Ghost of Tsushima at its best. Here it forgets about those four stances being used for enemy archetypes and you’re free to switch between them all, stringing your own combos together to bring down a dangerous enemy. It also helps that these automatically lock you on to your foe, whereas fights against groups have no lock on at all, sometimes leaving you swinging your sword into the air like you’re the one who’s scared of ghosts. As you lean into your Japanese Batman persona, the Mongols become more and more terrified of you. Sometimes you’ll kill one of their allies and their friends will stumble backwards, crawling away, opening them up for a sword through the belly. Sometimes they’ll down tools and leg it. Walking up to an archer, sword raised above your head, sidestepping and deflecting incoming arrows - it’s in these action sequences where Ghost of Tsushima excels. It has its moments, but like Jin Sakai in the opening hours, the past holds it back. It’s Open World: The Video Game. It’s far too easy, too - the lack of consequence for failure makes it feel like you’re just going through the motions. If you’ll excuse the wind-based pun, it’s a breeze. While playing it, I often found my mind wandering. By the third and final act, I just wanted it to be over. Like the samurai, Ghost of Tsushima feels like a relic of a bygone era.

Like clockwork, certain friends of mine text or IM when a big video game is about to launch. I'm the guy they know who gets games like a new Smash Bros. or Half-Life before the general public, and they love to push my embargoes to the limits with questions like ""does it live up to the hype?"" or ""no spoilers: should I buy it?""With Ghost of Tsushima, likely the last major new first-party game for Sony's PS4, I got a surprising number of these questions over the past few weeks. You might say they were surprising because Tsushima is an entirely new game series, not a hotly anticipated sequel. But the surprise came in a different form, as all of my friends came out of the woodwork to essentially ask me the same question: ""Is this new Sony game hopeful?""PS4 fans are likely still reeling from the console's last major exclusive, June's brutal Last of Us Part II—a game that revolves around the biological and social devastation following a global pandemic. TLOU2 is a brave, challenging, and compelling game, but the consensus I've gathered is that people are hungry for a different kind of adventure right now.So I'm starting my review of Ghost of Tsushima by loudly and emphatically saying yes, this game is hopeful in all of the best ways. The latest adventure game from Sucker Punch, makers of series like Sly Cooper and inFamous, has come out of nowhere to blow me away. I'm stunned in part because I nearly wrote the game off as an Assassin's Creed clone when its gameplay was revealed in April. You wouldn't be blamed for doing the same; we're now roughly 400 years into the ""open-world adventure"" trend, and these games sure do blur together.There's no blurring here, though. Tsushima stands out for many reasons, perhaps most crucially because it does something I haven't seen in the genre since Grand Theft Auto San Andreas: it nails the world-building relationship between the player, the protagonist, and the supporting cast. I rarely lost my sense of purpose or place while striving to bring honor back to my family and country as Jin Sakai, the game's hero. When he made friends, formed alliances, meditated on loss, or faced tragedy, I was there with him every step of the way, and this feeling was aided by a smartly paced stream of new samurai superpowers.Ghost of Tsushima is by no means a perfect game, but it nails the important stuff: its 30-hour quest will make you feel like the star of a story about revenge, principle, and inner peace.Before we dive into how the game plays, we should start with how it looks, because, goodness:See how diverse and gorgeous that gallery is? What if I told you that all of the above images are captured from the game's first 12 hours and that there's even more beautiful stuff waiting for you in the final game?The complete game is stuffed with moments worthy of screen grabs, which might be why GoT dedicates a d-pad button to a photo tool, as opposed to burying it beneath a pause menu. Freeze the world midgame, and the photo tool will give you total camera and visual-filter control while leaving the animation systems live. That part is crucial, because GoT follows the legacy of PS4 exclusive Horizon: Zero Dawn in terms of unbelievable grass, tree, and foliage animation—then goes further with an unbelievable lighting-and-shadow system that bathes any region, indoor or out, with appropriate, attractively saturated sunlight (or moonlight).Those windy, floaty-particle effects matter in this game, by the way, and I'll get to them in a bit.In even better news, you can expect a mostly locked 30 fps refresh, much like with TLOU2, whether you play on standard PS4 or on PS4 Pro. PS4 Pro owners also get to choose between a 30 fps lock at 1440p and an unlocked frame rate at 1080p. However, the frame-rate difference between these Pro options is hardly perceptible, since the frame rate never seemed to jump beyond 40 fps in my testing. I opted for the locked 30 fps option to avoid frame-pacing judder, and I wonder if this option was left specifically as a quick-and-dirty bonus for eventual PlayStation 5 players (assuming it's forward-compatible, which Sony hasn't yet confirmed).Performance on a current-gen console isn't just about the frames per second, however, and GoT is a beast in one other department: loading times, or lack thereof. This open-world game lets you run or ride on a horse through its worlds, but if you just want to tap an icon on your map and fast-travel—or if you die midmission and try again—the wait time is rarely more than 10 seconds and usually far less.GoT also includes a dramatic and compelling ""Kurosawa filter"" as a visual option. This homage to the iconic Japanese film director (Seven Samurai) works as you might expect: all in black-and-white with a film-grain effect and a mild audio filter. The best thing about this filter is that Sucker Punch has gone to great lengths to adjust the shades of backdrop objects and the contrast of foreground ones. Foliage-lined paths, crowds of foes, and towns carved by dramatic moonlight all look clear and are easy to navigate with the black-and-white filter enabled, and that's quite a technological feat.Unfortunately, as of launch, this handsome filter disables a crucial color-flash system during combat, which helps players react to attacks based on whatever color flashes. (Coincidentally, players also cannot choose which colors flash during full-color gameplay; bad news if you're colorblind.) I wish Sucker Punch had come up with an alternative visual tell for these attacks, like a giant series of flashing icons. But thanks to that issue, I had to disable the Kurosawa filter so that I could survive the game's later combat sections.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

Ghost of Tsushima,Chris White,God is a Geek,https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/ghost-of-tsushima-review/,"July 17, 2020Samurais were warriors of honour. Their code known as Bushido incorporated various ideals and beliefs from three separate religions, and in every single action and decision, they led by example and became the highest ranking castle throughout the Edo Period. There is beauty and pain in Ghost of Tsushima, eloquently portrayed throughout Jin’s journey, and battling with his own self in trying to honour the code he’s been brought up knowing and doing whatever it takes to defeat the Mongols makes for an engaging story. Not only is Tsushima a gorgeous island filled with fields of beautiful flowers and forests of golden leaves, it has many other alluring sights that constantly astound. The hot springs are serene and comforting; the snowy mountains are large beasts of nature; oceans thrash against beaches like a rapturous applause, and the various temples and homes littered throughout the three areas of Tsushima are simply stunning. The Photo Mode is a welcome addition, too. I spent far too much time snapping the scenery, and with plenty of options to make each photo different, it’s more than just an afterthought, that’s for sure.No matter where you travel to, the lack of a HUD provides ample opportunity to absorb the elegance of the land. Ghost of Tsushima is one of the best-looking games this generation, but the gameplay never suffers as a result. Instead of filling the map with objective markers and paths to waypoints, you use the Guiding Wind. By sliding your finger up on the Touch Pad, a wind blows in the direction of where you need to head to. It took me a while to get used to it, and at times the wind may not be clear when climbing up or down mountains, but it’s a unique addition that enhances your enjoyment of the visuals. It carries leaves in its path and disturbs tree branches, tussling with flowers and rustling through the grass, always aiding you in getting to your chosen destination. Jin has a vast range of abilities to choose from, and you’re always unlocking something new. Whilst the free-running elements can be slightly clumsy (especially when climbing up and down walls and buildings) it’s superb. It may not be on the same level as Assassin’s Creed, but it’s just enough to help you along your way. Combat is excellent. It provides a challenge no matter who you face, but you’ve always got plenty of tricks up your sleeve to succeed. Your Katana is an extension of your body, and using different stances against enemies offers a range of attacks. Being an experienced Samurai, your gift with a blade provides a bounty of outcomes no matter the type of enemy you face.Swordsmen, shieldmen, spearmen, and brutes will all come at you, and switching stances on the fly not only allows you to overcome your foes, but it’s pleasing on the eyes. Archers stand on the cusp of the fight, and are an enemy you need to be mindful of. If you’d rather approach a territory with stealth, you’ll be able to use your small Tanto blade to assassinate with accuracy. On top of your two standard weapons, you’ll come into possession of two different bows, various bombs, and other items that can be used to give you freedom whomever you face. The presentation of battle is spectacular. Before each confrontation you can initiate a stand-off where you approach one of the enemies in a one-on-one fight. By holding the Triangle button and releasing at the right time, you can kill them with one swift move of your katana, and it instantly gives you the upper hand – and even this is upgradable.Ghost Weapons are unlocked after completing quests and earning XP. These include Wind Chimes that distract enemies, and Kunai blades that can be thrown to startle or even kill. You’re given so many tools to enjoy combat that it simply never becomes dull. Even as you approach the end of Jin’s Journey, more weapons are added to your arsenal. I won’t spoil them here, but some of them are game-changers that both look awesome to use and add even more efficiency to the combat. On top of the wide range of equipment on offer, you can unlock new armour, masks, and headbands that provide different buffs to Jin, from improved stealth to concentration restoration (bullet time with your bow).You use your Resolve to fill your health bar if you become injured and unleash certain attacks, and collecting Charms you can equip to your weapons gives you added perks in battle. Once you defeat enemies or complete missions, you gain skill points to use across multiple paths, and to call it a Skill Tree undermines the hard work Sucker Punch have put in to make Jin as diverse as possible. Deflection and Evasion improve Jin’s Samurai skills by adding more options when parrying and dodging attacks. Mythic Techniques are unlocked through the Mythic Tales, and can be made more effective. You can also use your skill points to make your Stances more powerful (and add additional moves to them), your Ghost Weapons deadlier, and Evolving Tactics such as your proficiency with bow assassinations, and Stand-offs can also be built upon. Finally, you can use skill points to help your Guiding Wind find Shrines, Hot Springs, Clothing Items, and more.Outside of the main story, there is so much to do. I can’t recall a single fetch quest, as almost everything you do feels different. Mythic Tales start off with a tale told to you by a musician through animated black and white paintings, and upon completion give you either a new set of armour, a skin for your sword, a new Mythic Technique, or a rare resource such as gold. There are Mongol Strongholds to overthrow, ‘Tales of Tsushima’ that act as weighty side missions given to you by various island inhabitants or those you recruit to help your cause. Complete Fox Dens to build your Charm slots, climb Shrines to unlock new Charms, rest in Hot Springs to increase your maximum health, and inputting button sequences at Bamboo Strikes to build your Resolve.Some of the set pieces are remarkable feats of design. Attacking castles with fellow samurai and villagers provide intense battles, and one-on-one duels across some of the most beautiful locations across Tsushima add contrast to the bigger fights. Everything you do, be it a boss fight or a Shrine, is unique, and I can’t recall a game that gives you so much variety. The story takes a while to truly grab you, but when it does you’ll struggle to step away. Betrayal and honour; doing whats right becomes a blurred line, and knowing who to trust is something that is explored in tremendous fashion. Jin’s relationship with his uncle is interesting, as is his thirst for revenge. He’s a great character that has many different sides, but throughout everything his heart is in the right place.Ghost of Tsushima is a landmark game that blends its narrative and visuals perfectly, and has delicious, satisfying combat to boot. It does everything in its power to stay true to the greats of Samurai cinema, paying tribute to Akira Kurosawa by creating a mode dedicated solely to his style. Turning Kurosawa Mode on gives you a black and white filter with a gritty edge akin to his landmark movies, something the game never needs but is made better for having the option. The Stand-offs are great, and the way you’ll cut through Jin’s enemies will take your breath away. Traversing mountains and buildings can be clumsy, and the story takes a while to get going, but Ghost of Tsushima is a breathtaking experience that feels like nothing else I’ve played before.Stunning landscapes

Ghost of Tsushima,William Schwartz,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/ghost-of-tsushima-review/,"It’s hard to believe that Sucker Punch stayed so quiet for the better part of the current console generation. Yes, it really has been over six years since the initial release of Infamous: Second Son.  And now, with just months to go until a new set of video game consoles arrive, they’ve released one of their best exclusives to date with Ghost of Tsushima.  A big, beautiful, open-world game — Ghost of Tsushima is both similar to the studio’s previous work in the size and scope of the game, while also being tonally different when it comes to story telling.  There hasn’t been anything quite like Ghost of Tsushima to date, and Sucker Punch pulls off the period piece that whisks players to 13th century Japan where the Samurai of Tsushima face off against the first Mongol invaders.Everything you expect from open world games and some things that you don’tIn Ghost of Tsushima players assume the role of Jin Sakai.  The nephew of a samurai leader, the son of a slain warrior, and the assumed last samurai standing after the Mongols invade Tsushima island.  As the story churns, Sucker Punch gives players a deep look at Japan in this time period, as well as the interpersonal relationships of Jin — all the while allowing them to systematically expel the Mongols from these lands and ultimately kill the Khan.  The story bounces between themes of revenge, regret, friendships lost, and internal conflicts stemming from adhering to the ways of the Samurai and upholding the Shogun’s rules.  While Jin Sakai is a fictional character, the developers give players the full authentic experience, the likes of which we’ve only seen from Ubisoft with their historic deep dives offered in the Assassin’s Creed series.  A bit more palatable than those recent games that are bursting at the seams with filler, Ghost of Tsushima is a more concise experience, while still offering players plenty of freedom to explore, collect items, and improve their character through upgrades.The core of the game is centered around the combat and stealth sequences. Neither of which are implemented in ways that are revelations for the genre.  Whether on story missions, side missions, or free-roaming the country side looking for Mongol camps to overthrow,  combat in itself is a mixed bag.  At times it can feel incredibly fluid and fun.  While at others it can feel antiquated and lacking.  The system itself is built around stances, which need to be used for better effectiveness against certain types of enemies.  Enemies come in standard varieties, big brutes, shielded, swordsman and more.  Each have specific weakness to a fighting style and your job is to recognize and switch into these stances as necessary.  All the while, recognizing whether an enemy is attacking you with a blockable or non-blockable attack which you can either block, dodge, or parry.  The combat can be fun at times, especially when successfully integrating in the long range attacks from the bow and arrow or other projectile weapons, environmental hazards, and more.  Each fight can play out in a number of different ways depending on what weapons you use, which power-ups you have equipped, and how you choose to tackle a situation.  The most frustrating thing about it will likely be the lack of lock-on system, which can be pretty problematic when fighting large groups of enemies.  Trying to target specific enemies can be a chore and without a lock-on system you can find yourself flailing away quite often.  As for the aforementioned stealth sequences, these are offered as non-passable story events, but stealth is also a viable option for infiltrating any Mongol stronghold.  Though it stealth in itself is not a part of the Samurai code of honor.Combat and stealth aren’t a revelation but get the job doneWhile combat and stealth might not be a revelation, the organic nature in the way the world of Ghost of Tsushima is presented to the player does feel like it.  Long have open world games relied on waypoints and markers to push players towards their goals, and Ghost of Tsushima does this as well, though through different means.  Instead of the traditional waypoint systems that we’ve seen in other open world games, Sucker Punch uses a more natural visual device to light your path.  Like other games you can set your waypoints on an overworld map, but the way to them is highlighted by using a visual depiction of the wind.  These white gusts of wind will show you the direction that you need to head to get to your destination.  This more organic waypoint method does make the game world unfold to you in a more natural way.  Plus it’s just pretty to watch — flower petals and vegetation blowing in the wind, sweeping across the rolling hills of Japan can certainly be enchanting.  It’s clear that this was a focal point for the developers because it also applies to other aspects of the game — like liberating the Mongol controlled areas of Tsushima.   On the map these are red icons, but in the game world these are represented by plumes of smoke in the distance and smoldering buildings on the horizon.  Most of the land mass of Tsushima will be uncovered through your natural progression, and you’ll have plenty of moments that have you trekking through your beautiful homeland through vibrant fields filled with flowers, bamboo, and wildlife, OR, rushing towards the fire and smoke to expel the Mongols from another held territory.While the general trend of these big-budget open world games has been to throw so much at the player to overwhelm and give the impression of a massive amount of in-game content, Ghost of Tsushima doesn’t ever quite feel like this.  Whether looking at side missions, main path content, or optional free-roam activities or mini-games, there’s just enough of each to make it feel like a complete and fulfilling package.  That said, there never really feels like there’s a huge weight hanging around your neck, consisting of boring activities awaiting you in the future. That’s not to say that Ghost of Tsushima doesn’t have its own moments of monotonous content, because it does.The systems in place give the game a more organic feelThere are plenty of follow the NPC here to complete a mission, or retreaded gameplay ideas (turret sequences) that we’ve seen in countless games, the point is that it’s not as overwhelming as other open world games and it feels more approachable than most recent comparables.  Even in the crafting and upgrades section which tasks you with scavenging supplies and items from around the world, it always feels like your next upgrades are within reach, and not much mindless scouring for items will be necessary to get there.  That said, the entire package can still feel a little bit repetitive at times, but there’s just enough difference in sequences that take you away from the core combat game loop to make the game feel fresh, without being artificially extended.  To wrap that all together, Ghost of Tsushima is also well organized in its menus and interface to help you wrangle with the many systems here.  From upgrade points and available weapons and gear upgrades, everything feels like its at your fingertips, with helping tooltips to let you know what you might be missing.Ghost of Tsushima ultimately feels like a masterclass in open world game design.  Sucker Punch bucks modern trends to make a game that feels both massive and palatable, proving that there are still smart ways to refine a genre that’s been recently defined by sheer wealth of content.  It’s a beautiful game, in a setting that hasn’t been touched all that much and features gameplay systems that ultimately feel like they just get the job done, rather than reinvent anything worthwhile.  Ghost of Tsushima is a must-play for fans of many types of games, with a wealth of options for any type of player.Ghost of Tsushima is a masterclass on how to make an open world feel palatable and focused while still offering the rewarding progression necessary to make it all come together.  A mixture of traditional swordfighting combat and stealth sequences meld well with the beautiful, organically unfolding island of Tsushima and come together to form one of the best open world action games of the year.

Ghost of Tsushima,Joshua Wise,VideoGamer,http://www.videogamer.com//reviews/ghost-of-tsushima-review," Posted in Reviews
What makes a role-playing game? Purists would argue that a table is required, along with a sheaf of papers and a clutch of polyhedral dice. Players of video games may prefer a crowded stack of menus, in which characters, like bank statements, are sorted into columns and balanced with numbers. Others consider story to be of the utmost importance—one that you steer and stain with your own choices. All robust answers, to be sure, but have you ever thought about a flute? What about a polite bow of the head? Or a haiku, composed on a peaceful cliff? Such is the handful of fleeting gestures, ultimately pointless yet marked with meaning, available to Jin Sakai: a samurai and errant lord, and the hero of Ghost of Tsushima.The haiku come in handy for two reasons. First, they unlock new headbands to wear—the adventure bristles with the dollish joys of dress-up—and second, they give pause: a chance for Jin to refrigerate his anger. Not that his frustration isn’t justified; his home has been invaded by Mongols, led by the fearsome Khotun Khan, and his uncle, Lord Shimura, has been captured by the enemy. We are introduced to the Khan in the opening scene, on a battle-soiled beach: “I am Khotun. Cousin of Kublai. Grandson of Genghis.” He is cloaked in fur, sports a down-to-business buzz cut, and a face well furrowed by conquest. Most terrifying of all, he has done his homework. “I know your language. Your traditions. Your beliefs. Which villages to tame and… which to burn.” He illustrates this last point, when challenged by a single proud samurai to a fair duel, by tossing a goblet of oil over the fellow, setting him aflame, and slicing off his head. Thus the game’s defining dilemma is ignited: how do you fight with honour an opponent who is willing to slink below the ramparts of your code?One answer—prevalent for me during the early hours—is to remain rigid. After being felled, stuck with arrows, hurled from a bridge, and nursed from the brink by a friend, Jin sets about corralling local forces to mount a sortie and rescue his uncle. “I need every ally I can trust,” he says, and some are tucked in faraway corners, fogged over on the map and waiting to be recruited. The first act is a wonder, spent roaming and challenging any passing Mongol patrols. We get a scattering of flashbacks to Jin’s boyhood, filled with those charming father-son chats that warm the heart. “Only cowards strike from the shadows,” the older man says, holding a wooden sword beneath a blood-dark tree. “When a samurai faces a devious foe, he must rise above them—and never sink to their level. No matter how tempting.”So it was that, on dispatching a group of Mongol soldiers, I would give a deferential swipe on the PlayStation touchpad, causing Jin to gently lower his head in respect (to my delight, he would occasionally utter a stoic blessing). I often did the same when meeting new people. On horseback, I would sometimes play Jin’s flute, planting some lifting notes on the breeze. When on foot, I would walk, not run. And I robed myself in billowy silks, spending hours searching for the perfect straw hat. These flourishes serve little purpose, when juxtaposed against the grand, grim theatre of war, and that is their magic: they root you in the ordinary dirt of the world and coax you to play along. If Ghost of Tsushima is a gripping role-playing game, it’s because it revels in the idea that role-playing is a game.And so, too, it proves with the combat. Ranged against Jin is the usual horde: brutes bearing house-sized shields, long-reaching spear-wielders, cowardly archers lurking at the fringes, and so on. Ideally, they are not so much fought as rock-paper-scissored, by switching to the corresponding stance from an available four. Each has Jin hold a stylish pose, and powers up his movements with whirls, chops, and lunges. You end up with passages of violence that have the pulse of choreography to them. Those arriving bruised and bolstered from the Japan of Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice (a far crueller, rot-darkened isle than Tsushima) will find nothing to injure their ego here. In fact, rather the opposite: the fights seem custom-forged to make you feel cool. Each encounter, from its beginning burst of action to its final, resounding cut, has the quality of a scene—and rarely a sense of depravity or genuine loss. “Not everyone can be a samurai,” Jin says to one of his countrymen, who replies, “But we’re all killers.” For Ghost of Tsushima, the killing is lacquered with the allure of its central proposition: that everyone can be a samurai.The developer is Sucker Punch Productions, famous for games where getting around is half the fun. You may find yourself, steeped in slow-paced wandering and faced with vistas of sylvan green, thinking, This is from the studio that made Infamous: Second Son?  True enough, the damp rat run of Seattle’s streets, through which the superpowered Delsin Rowe cheesily romped, seems far off. But look more closely at Tsushima and you can spot the signs. Note the colours: the game is an impasto of outrageous reds, of chrome-yellow clouds and airbrushed blue mornings. At night, the moon is xenon-bright, like a single glaring headlamp. You get the impression that the director, Nate Fox, who also directed Second Son, has comic books in his bloodstream, and the art direction, lead by Jason Connell, blends high and low: plaintive natural beauty with a kind of exaggerated pop sensibility.I had to stifle a laugh when I stumbled on the “Kurosawa mode,” which veils the visuals in dappled black-and-white and cramps the audio to a fashionably grainy tenor. It’s a boy’s-bedroom aesthetic: a wall-poster depiction of cult style, arresting and hokey. Elsewhere, however, Ghost of Tsushima is fresh—the product of a maturing developer. In place of a mini-map, you summon a gust of guiding wind; collectibles are discovered by following not waypoints but foxes and bright-hued birds. The dull litter of exploration is tucked and tidied away, freeing the screen to pull your attention from the path ahead and plunge you into the wilds. (Sucker Punch takes pains not to bore; should you tire of your thundering horse, any discovered point of interest can be instantly zapped to, with a liberatingly short load screen.)I am pleased to report that there were days, in the last couple of weeks, on which I woke excited at the prospect of playing—at dipping back into the fantasy. If your adventuring eyes are tired, I recommend it as I would a cold towel. You’re never as happy as when you’re lost in the early languor—which blankets the most enticing open worlds like a mist, before burning off under the hissing pressure of a plot. The game may never have been as sweet as it was in the first of the three main areas, but, to its credit, that’s because I was swept along by the story.Soon, Jin’s creed—the thick plating of his beliefs—proves incapable of defeating the forces that besiege Tsushima, and he has no choice but to change. “Your way can’t save our people,” he says to his uncle. A new way must take its place. It was at this point I was put in mind of another errant lord, on a different island, taking arms against a sea of similar troubles and turning himself into something else entirely. Jin becomes the Ghost, covered by a grimacing mask (in the name of theatricality and deception, naturally), shrouded in black, and armed with an array of sneaky tactics—smoke bombs, firecrackers, poison-tipped darts, etc. He’s a feudal-flavoured Japanese Batman, swinging from the trees with a grappling hook, complete with a cape fluttering in his wake. And, just like the Ghost of Gotham, he inspires fear in his foes.When Lord Shimura, troubled by the transformation, says, “I trained you to fight with honour,” Jin sounds drained, and spiked with regret: “Honour died on the beach.” Indeed, and its ghost now haunts the hills, looking for revenge. The conflict between samurai and Ghost—a proto-ninja, in effect—can be read as an update on the laughable morality mechanics of the Infamous games. The cringeworthy “corrupt” and “redeem” options are gone, replaced with a needling awareness that, by going in quiet, you’re betraying your heritage. The advantages of doing so are palpable; the Mongols murder their hostages when under attack, so stealth becomes important when infiltrating enemy bases. But I didn’t enjoy being the Ghost as much as I did a samurai. Perhaps because the sneaking is unremarkable—overly lenient line-of-sight, with a modern reliance on tall grass (the genre is in need of some weeding, as of late). And perhaps because we have plenty of good ninja games and not enough samurai simulators.Whichever method you relish, what we are left with is the compelling pursuit of a theme: of old ways assaulted by an uncaring world. The game’s fawning over Kurosawa betrays its quiet failing. While playing, I kept thinking of Sanjuro, of the climactic scene, in which the hero bests a furious rival in front of a captive audience of young would-be samurai. “That was brilliant!” one of them says, as the blood pours out in a silvery stream. “Idiot! What do you know about anything?” snaps the hero, bereft at the squandering of life, before cautioning them: “The best sword is kept in its sheath.” Yeah right, not a chance. Sucker Punch doesn’t reach the melancholy of Kurosawa—the notion that below the elegant framing and wide-shot tranquility is a dribbling run-off of waste and sorrow. Nor could it, in a blockbuster video game that demands a generous supply of action and flash. Still, when you’re cantering through its serene peaks, reenacting your favourite samurai-movie battles, it’s difficult not to come to a simple conclusion. That was brilliant!Developer: Sucker Punch ProductionsPublisher: SonyAvailable on: PlayStation 4Release date: July 17, 2020To check what a review score means from us, click here.

This may sound odd, given that it’s a brand-new IP, developed exclusively for the PlayStation 4, and a complete departure from Sucker Punch’s earlier Infamous series. Rather than a near-future freedom fighter, the game casts you as a samurai in medieval Japan, substituting swords for superpowers and stealth for scaling tall buildings. You’ll embark upon a quest for family honor, and grapple with questions of morality during war. There’s even a “Kurosawa filter,” if you want to play through the whole experience like an old samurai movie.But for all of its atmospheric trappings, Ghost of Tsushima is not that dissimilar from Infamous — and extremely similar to Assassin’s Creed. It’s an open-world historical action game, where you can either sneak your way past enemies or engage them in open combat. You’ll explore the large world map for semi-meaningful side content, riding from objective to objective on horseback, stopping occasionally for some light platforming to reach out-of-the-way collectibles.Release date: July 17, 2020
Price: $59.99 / £54.99
Platform: PS4Familiarity doesn’t have to breed contempt, though, particularly since Ghost of Tsushima has a fast-paced, fun combat system and an excellent setting. If you have any affinity for Japanese history, old samurai films or open-world games with surprisingly good combat, Ghost of Tsushima is a guaranteed good time — at least until the novelty wears off.Read on for our full Ghost of Tsushima review. Ghost of Tsushima casts you as Jin Sakai: a samurai on the Japanese island of Tsushima in the late 13th century CE. To fend off the invading Mongol forces, Jin must explore the island of Tsushima, face off against invaders in open combat and sneak his way into fortified settlements with a variety of skills and gadgets. Half the game is open-world exploration, one-quarter is swordfighting and one-quarter is stealth.In other words: Ghost of Tsushima is more or less what you’d get if you set an Assassin’s Creed game in Japan, with a bigger focus on aesthetics and sword combat. And it succeeds on pretty much every count.Let’s discuss the swordfighting first, as it’s easily the best part of the game. Jin is armed with two upgradeable swords: a long katana for open combat, and a short wakizashi for stealth. Throughout the game, you’ll fight off various Mongols, ronin and bandits. Jin can learn four different fighting styles and switch among them at-will: one to counter swords, one to counter shields, one to counter spears and one to counter huge “brute” enemies.I must have had dozens or hundreds of standoffs during my time with Ghost of Tsushima, and it never once got old.At first, your sword options are limited to blocking and attacking. But as you learn new skills and defeat Mongol warlords, you’ll learn the “stances” that let you counter different enemy types. You can switch among them at-will during battle, and I was quite impressed at how gentle the learning curve is. Toward the beginning of the game, I found it difficult to switch between a sword stance and a shield stance; by the end, I was switching stances effortlessly from enemy to enemy, while alternating sword strikes with bows and arrows, blow darts, sticky bombs and throwing daggers (kunai).Sword combat feels intuitive and fluid, and incorporates some samurai flavor into the mechanics as well as the aesthetics. For example: You can approach a group of enemies openly and challenge them to a “standoff,” where you need to hold your attack until the last possible second for a one-hit kill. As Jin gets more powerful and acquires better gear, you can defeat up to five enemies in a single standoff, like the lone hero in a samurai movie. I must have had dozens or hundreds of standoffs during my time with Ghost of Tsushima, and it never once got old.You can also infiltrate enemy bases with stealth, sneaking up on enemies to assassinate them, distracting them with firecrackers, making yourself disappear with smoke bombs and so forth. While it’s not as deep as the sword combat, it’s all functional, and fairly forgiving of mistakes. This is not a tear-your-hair-out, one-false-move-and-you’re-done stealth experience. However, many of the story missions treat it that way, making them much more tedious and punishing than the side content.When you’re not fighting off foes, you’ll explore the enormous island of Tsushima, which is divided into three “districts,” each one with a certain number of locations under Mongol control. As you liberate settlements, you’ll open up more and more of the map, which is a pretty organic way to handle exploration — or you could just jump on your horse and see what’s out there.There’s plenty to find. There are fox dens, where helpful animals will lead you to equippable charms. There are relaxing hot springs that increase your health. There are hard-to-reach Shinto shrines that require some nimble platforming. There are even quiet spots in nature where you can compose your own haikus. There are also character-driven “Tales,” which act like more traditional side quests. As you level up, you can also spend your upgrade points on exploration powers, which help guide you to the next side activity, which is a pretty clever midpoint between wandering aimlessly and just showing you where every side encounter is. However, like many open-world games, there is so much side content in Ghost of Tsushima that it gets repetitive long before the end — particularly since most of the rewards are meager.Aesthetically, the game is very deep, offering you tons of different headbands, helmets, hats, face masks, armor sets, dyes, scabbards and so forth. You can make a Jin Sakai that probably doesn’t look like any other player’s Jin Sakai — and there’s a very good chance that you can make him look just like the hero of your favorite samurai movie. Upgrading equipment can be a bit of a pain, since you’ll need to constantly scrounge for supplies and resources, but if you focus your efforts to just a few weapons and armor sets, you’ll have everything you need by the end of the game.There is so much side content in Ghost of Tsushima that it gets repetitive long before the end — particularly since most of the rewards are meager.Mechanically, though, Ghost of Tsushima actually gets less interesting the longer you play. Jin has a ton of skill trees available to him — parrying, dodging, four different swordsman stances, gadgetry, general skills, exploration powers and so forth. Having to decide which skill is the most pressing and foregoing other abilities creates a great push-and-pull between “I need this now” and “I might need this later.”However, by about halfway through the game, you’ll probably have mastered all of your favorite abilities. By the end of the game, you’ll have enough points to master everything. I can’t help but think the game might have been a little more interesting if it made you focus on certain skills and forego others.Ghost of Tsushima tries to counter this power-creep with massive difficulty spikes at the beginning of each new Act (there are three altogether, one for each district), but the game runs out of new ideas well before the end, making most of Act II and nearly all of Act III a bit of a slog.The story in Ghost of Tsushima held my attention from beginning to end, thanks to a clean, logical narrative and a cast of three-dimensional characters. If you’ve ever seen a classic samurai film, or learned about the Mongol invasion of Japan, or know the basics of a three-act story structure, there’s nothing mind-blowing here. But there are a few good twists and turns, and the cast is strong enough to carry the narrative through a few slow patches.Ghost of Tsushima tells a fictionalized version of the Mongol invasion of Japan in 1274 CE. Khotun Khan, cousin of Kublai, intends to lead an army into Japan, using the island of Tsushima as a staging ground. Badly wounded in the Khan’s initial attack, samurai Jin Sakai vows to oust the Mongols and rescue his uncle, the honorable Lord Shimura, even if he has to embrace deception, terror and assassination to do so.The central tension between Jin the samurai and Jin the Ghost is strong enough to carry most of the game, and Khotun Khan turned out to be a better villain than I expected. As the grandson of Genghis and the cousin of Kublai, he feels he must forge his own place in history, and who can blame him?My only real complaint was that the story doesn’t reflect the gameplay. Early on, Lord Shimura warned Jin against using shady tactics in a flashback, and I abided by his words. I faced every enemy in the game head-on and didn’t touch the underhanded “Ghost” powers. Even so, Khotun taunted Shimura with news of my “dishonorable” actions, and an Act II story mission forced me into some extremely dark moral territory. The game lets you build your own Jin, but doesn’t do anything to reflect the choices you make with him.Reviewed on a standard 1080p PS4, Ghost of Tsushima looks pretty good. The level design is beautiful, from remote fishing villages, to snowy mountains, to fields of autumn leaves. If you have a favorite Japanese aesthetic trope, it’s probably in here somewhere, from swirling cherry blossoms to Shinto shrines overlooking the ocean. The game wants to create a mood more than it wants to recreate the real medieval Tsushima, but it definitely succeeds.My favorite aesthetic touch actually has to do with navigation. Ghost of Tsushima has a minimalist HUD, and that means there’s no minimap. As such, to find your next objective, you’ll rely on the Guiding Wind: a gentle breeze that blows grass, flowers and leaves to indicate where to go next. You control the Guiding Wind by brushing up on the DualShock 4’s touchpad. It’s an unobtrusive marriage of gameplay and aesthetics, and I wish more games followed its lead.The music consists of a lot of strings and flutes, as you might expect. It’s all pleasantly atmospheric and gets the job done. The voice acting is more of a mixed bag. The English voices sound a little stilted and don’t always match the characters’ lip movements — almost as though you’re watching a dubbed movie. I get the impression that you’re supposed to turn on the Japanese language track and use subtitles, which is an option, although one that I used infrequently.One potentially cool idea is Ghost of Tsushima’s “Kurosawa mode,” which adds a grainy black-and-white filter and changes the framerate somewhat. Combined with the Japanese language track and English subtitles, this makes Ghost of Tsushima look just like a samurai film from the ‘50s or ‘60s. It’s incredibly cool to use this mode now and then, but it’s not really practical over the long term. A lot of important gameplay cues are blue or orange, and the colors in the environment are quite striking. I’d often play a single mission in Kurosawa mode, find it frustrating, and change right back.Ghost of Tsushima has a solid story, extremely fun combat and a rewarding open-world. However, it also drags on entirely too long and can’t quite reconcile its narrative with its gameplay. You’ve almost certainly played a game like Ghost of Tsushima before, and it doesn’t do enough with the formula to really stand out in a crowded field.Still, I’d be lying if I said I wasn't hooked from start to finish. It’s probably one of my favorite games of the year so far. More than once, I had to drag myself away from the screen only because I’d run down the batteries on two controllers in a row.If you have an affinity for samurai stories, open-world adventures or refined sword combat, Ghost of Tsushima is an easy recommendation. But if you’ve had your fill of liberating towns, collecting doodads and riding from one waypoint to another on horseback, it’s better to just load up a Kurosawa film on HBO Max.Marshall Honorof is a senior editor for Tom's Guide, overseeing the site's coverage of gaming hardware and software.

Create Account If imitation is indeed the sincerest form of flattery, Sucker Punch’s sprawling historical open world adventure Ghost of Tsushima is a loving ode to Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed games, which have more or less owned this space for the last decade and a half.Based loosely on the thirteenth century Mongol invasion of the island of Tsushima, which served as run-up to a full-scale assault on the Japanese mainland, it begins with a brutal battle in which the atoll’s small samurai force stands against a legion of invaders before being overwhelmed and destroyed. Jin Sakai, loyal nephew of the leader of the ruling clan, is badly wounded but pulled from the battle and nursed back to health by a thief who needs his help. By the time Jin awakens, the Mongols have completely subjugated the island, mercilessly killing or enslaving everyone they stumble upon. As we begin exploring, we see firsthand the supreme savagery of the occupying force, which has left the bodies of murdered families and the ashen ruins of countless villages in its wake. Jin makes it his mission to bring hope and freedom back to the peaceful people of Tsushima.Sign up to receive the daily top stories from the Financial Post, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.A welcome email is on its way. If you don't see it, please check your junk folder.The next issue of Financial Post Top Stories will soon be in your inbox. We encountered an issue signing you up. Please try again That’s the set-up. What follows is a game that relies so heavily on the established framework of recent Assassin’s Creed games that a casual observer could be excused for thinking that it was, in fact, the latest entry in Ubisoft’s flagship series.Players are provided an enormous and lush recreation of the entirety of Tsushima Island that can be freely explored on foot or horseback. Jin can climb mountains, swim across rivers, and use a grappling hook to latch onto distant tree branches and rooftops to hoist himself up. We gather plants, metals, and hides used to craft better gear; collect artifacts and notes that offer real historical insight into how both the Japanese and Mongols lived (I’ll never think about milk the same way); meet and become close friends with interesting characters who have problems of their own; carefully ascend rocky precipices to reach sacred shrines and treasures, and survey and plan out attacks on well-guarded towns and fortresses in order to liberate them.Sound familiar yet?Most of these mechanics and systems are executed with precision and flare, and are undeniably enjoyable. But there can be little doubt that they are more the result of inspiration and imitation rather than a truly creative spark.Sucker Punch does, however, earn kudos for originality in other ways.Graphically, the game is an absolute wonder. Tsushima’s geography is rivetingly beautiful, from bamboo forests and heaving mountains to picturesque waterfalls and seas of swaying pampas grass composed of thousands of gently moving blades each of which will catch the moonlight on a clear night. I could almost feel the chill of thunderstorms as they came crashing in and the heat of the sun as it rose above the horizon in a dazzling blaze of light. Even the wind feels like a living force, always blowing towards our current goal and thus elegantly eliminating the need for an artificial objective tracker as part of the heads-up display.And the visuals do more than simply strive for authenticity. Ghost of Tsushima gushes style like an oil pipe split wide. We see it when Jin takes time out to compose haikus inspired by the nature around him, and when he swings his sword with deadly, slow-motion enhanced one-stroke kills during the game’s outstanding standoff encounters before whipping his sword to fling off the blood and slowly sheathing it in classic samurai style. There’s even a display option called Kurosawa mode — named after the famed Japanese auteur Akira Kurosawa, whose movies clearly influenced the game’s filmic style and identity — that applies a grainy black and white filter, making it feel like we’re taking part in an interactive version of Throne of Blood or The Hidden Fortress.Combat has some clever innovations, too. The standoffs mentioned above — which allow Jin to begin fights by calling out the strongest warrior among a group of enemies for a duel — provide a means for us to dispatch enemies quickly, assuming you have the required reflexes. And rather than relying on tricky button combinations, Jin’s journey as a warrior involves learning a variety of battle stances and techniques suited for specific enemies, such as swordsmen, shieldmen, spearmen, and heavies. Quickly and fluidly switching between these stances in the middle of brawls against multiple foes is essential, and leads to some spectacularly cinematic fight choreography that plenty of players will be eager to capture and share.Battles aren’t without issue — the camera isn’t always cooperative, and the auto targeting system sometimes doesn’t pick the enemy you might think it should — but the fighting feels deep and sophisticated, and continues to evolve and challenge us through the course of the game, which is no easy task for an adventure that can last 50 hours or more.The most engaging facet of the experience, however, is the story. It’s filled with complex characters and moral dilemmas, not least of which is a meaningful examination of the age-old problem of whether noble ends can excuse dubious means. The samurai credo is tied up in a traditional concept of honour so rigid that death is considered preferable to winning battles using underhanded tactics. Massively outnumbered by an enemy unhesitant to do whatever it takes to win, Jin and his small group of ragtag allies have to decide whether saving the people and culture of Tsushima warrants abandoning the Way of the Samurai.Even more interesting to me, however, were some of the quieter tales tangential to the main plot, including a subtly performed series of scenes in which Jin reconnects with his childhood caregiver, who is now suffering senility, and learns of a family secret he never suspected as a child but which he gracefully accepts as an adult. This unexpected yet convincing sensitivity is also evident when he discovers a same-sex relationship between one of his closest allies and a house servant. Point being, there’s a lot more to our protagonists than their ability to stylishly slice and dice Mongols.Unfortunately, the Mongols are pretty one-dimensional by comparison. I don’t think there’s a single instance in which a Mongol soldier is portrayed as sympathetic or anything other than fodder for Jin’s sword and bow. It makes it easier to cleave your way through them without remorse, but even just a mission about conscientious deserters or a serious contrasting of cultural philosophies would have gone some way towards humanizing Jin’s foes.Ghost of Tsushima is indisputably indebted to Assassin’s Creed (and, to a lesser degree, Rockstar’s Red Dead Redemption games), but it does just enough to establish a personality of its own. And it’s fun. I never lost interest in exploring the island and learning what lay beyond distant hills and mountains, and the slick, stylish combat kept me itching for fights right up until the final battle.If you want to give your Criterion Collection Kurosawa Blu-rays a rest and are looking for a safe way to kill a few weeks while locked away in your house this blistering summer, you could do a lot worse than what Sucker Punch has given us in this gorgeous and enormous samurai epic.

Ghost of Tsushima,Ron Burke,GamingTrend,https://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/eternal-blue-sky-ghost-of-tsushima-review/,"In 1274, the first attempt to conquer Japan was made by the Mongols, landing on an island called Tsushima. The samurai suffered horrible losses against the unconventional weapons and tactics of the Mongol army. The battle at Komoda beach was a bloody affair that wiped out the samurai army and Sō Sukekuni, their shugo or military governor. This real-life battle serves as the basis for Ghost of Tsushima. You play Lord Jin Sakai, a samurai warrior who survived the battle at Komoda beach and is forced to make terrible choices to repel the Mongols to reclaim his home.While Tsushima is a real place, and the battle at Komoda beach really happened, the team at Sucker Punch took some liberties with the outcome to create this game. Tsushima is not a 1:1 representation of the real-world location, but does represent the best parts of what it might have looked like in 1274. They’ve also created a compelling and plausible fictional descendant of Kublai Khan in the game’s antagonist, Khotun Khan — a fearless and intelligent Mongol General. Jin Sakai is a Lord from clan Sakai, a real-world samurai clan, albeit from the 16th Century — a full 250 years after the events of this game. It allowed them to bring the real world and their compelling narrative of family, honor, loss, and war together to create a blend that not only works, but rings enough truth to make it fascinating. If you are anything like me, it’ll have you diving back into historical books about feudal Japan.As usual, I will take as light of a touch as I can on story elements and spoilers in this review. Rest assured, I don’t want to ruin this game for you. Let’s get into it.The Mongols have invaded the island of Tsushima, and the samurai were overwhelmed by the brutal tactics and sheer numbers their enemy brought to the battlefield. Very few samurai were left alive, and you would have shared the same fate if not for a peasant who nursed you back to health. Unfortunately you are now alone, your armor destroyed, forcibly removed from your ancestral home, with no allies, and no chance of retaking the island from the invading horde. You’ll need weapons, armor, allies, and more importantly, a new approach to combat as the last one nearly got you killed. To defeat this unconventional foe, you’ll need unorthodox techniques.Samurai follow a code of conduct called Bushido. Bushido is a strict code involving eight codes — justice, courage, mercy, politeness, honesty and sincerity, loyalty (to their Lord and Daimyo), character and self control, and above all others, honor. In practical application it meant always facing your foe head on, looking them in the eye, and dueling them honorably. The mere concept of attacking someone from the shadows was considered to be cowardly and without honor. Losing one’s honor was insurmountable, often calling on the samurai to commit ritual suicide, or seppuku. Jin’s savior is a thief and would be considered without honor, but it isn’t long before Jin is out of options. Should he become the Ghost of Tsushima, lowering himself and otherwise sullying his honor, or should he remain true to the code of Bushido and that of the samurai? The choice is yours.As someone who has spent a great deal of my life studying various martial arts, I have a deep appreciation for the approach Sucker Punch has taken to combat. Jin Sakai will face a variety of enemies with an array of weapons and armor in his adventure. Squaring off against an enemy that can hit you with tremendous force versus a quick moving foe with a long spear requires entirely different strategies, and the team has captured that nicely here. Real world Japanese sword fighting has arguably over 20 “postures” (or kamae) that you’ve likely seen in movies — sword high with the body straight (hasso no kamae), sword straight and level behind the swordsman (sha no kamae), kneeling with the sword lowered at a 45 degree angle (suwari migi gedan no kamae), and single handed sword high and to the rear (sasagakure no kamae) seem to be in every movie, just to name a few. Sucker Punch boils this down to just four — Stone, Wind, Water, and Moon. While Jin and others may still strike stances from what appears to be Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū, they are simplified so as to not overwhelm the player. Stone is a heavy defensive stance, allowing Jin to absorb more damage and is best for handling other swordsmen. Water uses more circular techniques, swinging underneath shields and breaking the enemy’s guard. Wind focuses on speed, emphasizing agility to avoid and counterstrike incoming spearmen. Moon is for the bigger brutes you’ll face, emphasizing heavy kicks to knock them off balance, and then heavy spinning attacks to generate momentum and power. Like the real thing, it takes a bit of time to get used to it, but before long you’ll be switching between stances quickly, dominating the battlefield regardless of foe.While his katana and wakizashi are powerful weapons in his arsenal, they are far from Jin’s only tools. Soon after escaping the initial assault by Mongol forces, he’ll have a chance to reunite with his old archery master, obtaining a half-bow in the process. This will let Jin cut down foes from a moderate distance, but you’ll need to find a daikyu (heavy bow) to do any long-distance work. Over the course of 50 hours of gameplay, that arsenal will grow as Jin’s needs shift and change, but that’s for you to discover.Jin’s progression in Ghost of Tsushima is accomplished by earning enough “Legend” to earn technique points. These points can be invested in a number of ways, chiefly among them being stances. Stances, as we’ll discuss later, are about squaring off with a foe head-to-head. Ghost techniques are more about deception and distraction. A kunai to the face will break a foe’s guard, just like a smoke bomb will disorient them for escape or a stealthy assassination. These tools, weapons, and techniques expand greatly over time, but part of that progression is tightly tied to the story, so it’s yours to reveal. What’s beautiful about the way Sucker Punch has implemented this progression, however, is that it didn’t feel like I had to “level up” at any point. This game is about skill, technique, timing, and observation as much as it is about what weapons and tools you possess. Sword fighting can be over in the blink of an eye, and nowhere is that truer than here.In practice, the decision to pursue that of a Ghost or a samurai is more about play style than story outcomes, and it’s very likely you’ll use a mixture of both as the situation demands. Your Ghost selections focus on distraction, deception, and disabling your opponents, whereas your stances are centered around facing your opponent head on and with honor. There are baked-in gameplay beats that may emphasize one type of engagement over another, but very rarely does the game force you into any one path.The main storyline is rather lengthy, easily taking roughly 30 hours on its own, but the “Tales”, or side missions, will tack on another 20. Finding everything is easily another 10-12, I’d guess — it never felt like a grind, so I freely admit I didn’t track it that closely. Not unlike CD Projekt Red’s game, The Witcher III: Wild Hunt, the side missions often feel just as well written and plot-relevant to the main story thread. Having finished them all, I have to say that each had its own story to tell. Sure, some of them are simple delivery missions or “track and kill”, but the writing in each is fantastic.The amount of collectibles in Ghost of Tsushima is massive. Beyond trinkets like headbands you get for meditation or exploration, you’ll also get the opportunity to collect a great many sets of armor. These all have three bonuses attached to them, as well as several steps of upgrades for each. There are so many that it was hard to choose, but by the end of the game I knew I had to have every single one of them. It’s rare for me to want to chase down all of the collectibles in the game, but in Ghost of Tsushima, it never felt like a chore.Japanese tradition is filled with myths and stories, and this game stays fairly rooted in grim reality, although there are moments that transcend into legends. Mystic armors and weapons once used by well-storied masters are recounted by the local shamisen musician (the guitar played with a bachi pick). These stories will lead Jin to explore the most dangerous and hidden places of Tsushima island to try to find these wonderful artifacts. While they are entirely optional, they are also extraordinary moments that no player should miss.Tshushima is a real place, and Sucker Punch has brought to life the most beautiful and brutal parts of this Japanese island. Shortly after the game’s brief introduction, you are set free on the island of Tsushima with a handful of main missions and the wind at your back. You’ll want to pay attention to that wind as it serves as the central navigation indicator for the game. Swiping up on the PlayStation 4 touchpad causes the wind to swirl in the direction of your selected objective, stirring up maple leaves and cherry blossoms and sending them in the direction you need to go. There is no navigation hud with waypoints — just the wind guiding you in the general direction. It’s soothing and fits with the excellent thematic components that make up the entire experience. Hitting the options button lets you change what you’d like the wind to “focus” on, be it a rumored location you’ve heard about from a villager, a nearby fox den, a random collectible record, or any other manner of places and things. As you get very close, you’ll see an indicator telling you where you need to go, but otherwise it’s a seamless and transparent system — I really appreciated the simplicity and tranquility of it.Speaking of guides, you have a few friends that’ll help you find places of interest in the world. A brilliant yellow oriole will soar past, encouraging you to follow it to something you’ve not yet found nearby. Foxes will sit underneath trees cleverly illuminated with swarms of slow-moving lighting bugs, guiding you to Inari shrines. These shrines expand your secondary charm slots for your katana. You can also find hot spring baths to rest, restore, and slightly expand your health bar, bamboo cutting poles for tameshigiri (the art of cutting through multiple bamboo shoots with a single strike), caged crickets that can teach you new flute songs if you collect enough, and much more. The world is alive with things to see, do, explore, and collect, but thankfully it all feels very optional and non-intrusive. You don’t have to compose a single haiku at a zazen location if you don’t want to — they only yield cosmetic headbands, but I can’t help but feel like you are missing out if you skip them.There are mysteries to discover in Ghost of Tsushima. I found one particular place where bowing to a frog statue caused dozens of live frogs to gather at my feet. I found another where bowing in front of a lake caused the fish to jump around in the water. Grasshoppers swarm at another shrine. What do any of these mean? Are they just for fun? Is there a larger mystery to unravel? Either way, it makes the world feel alive, and it keeps your eyes searching.  Throughout the island of Tsushima you’ll find Torii gates which mark the paths to the famed Shinto shrines of Tsushima. Unfortunately, the Mongol invaders have destroyed the wooden bridges that lead to these shrines. Jin has to use his wits and tools to find other ways to reach them. These shrines present a navigational puzzle to solve, rewarding him with charms that he can attach to his weapons. These augments can restore a small bit of health when killing a foe, make it easier to block and deflect, grant a small amount of resolve (the “power” you use to unleash your special sword techniques), among other things. There are quite a few to find, allowing you to further customize to fit your playstyle.If you’ve seen any movie by Akira Kurosawa, it quickly becomes clear that his work served as a major inspiration for Ghost of Tsushima. From the opening moments of the game you’ll see very similar structure and storytelling mechanics. Massive battles taking place in the foreground while the rising sun sets in the background. Kurasawa liked movement in his films, and you see that similarly reflected here. Nature plays a major role in framing shots, where the actors are still, but the storm in the background creates a great deal of motion. Smoke and fire in the distance cuts a scar in the otherwise beautiful landscape as leaves dance on the wind. Your archery master stands with you in his dojo talking about someone he lost to the Mongols as a torrential rain cascades. It tells a story inside the story. Similarly, the Sucker Punch team used the sorts of creative shot blocking that Kurosawa frequently employed, walking the camera behind an obstruction like a jail cell pole, around a pillar, or other realistic framed object. I may be delving full-on into film dork territory, but you’ll also see similar camera movement work. The camera is rarely stationary, instead focusing on the character, but also moving within the space to create cinematic movement that tells as much story as what is being said. Long sight lines leading up a dramatic staircase to the Golden Temple is already a cool shot, but the sheer amount of movement from the all-yellow trees leading up to it creates a magnificent cinematic moment that never ceases to amaze, no matter how many times you ride through it. You are so focused on the beauty of the place that you actually stop paying attention to the place itself. It’s very zen, and I love it.Nowhere is Kurosawa’s influence more injected than in the duel sequences. Occasionally Jin will face master swordsmen that could be considered “bosses”. They will challenge your timing and skills, and they are visually arresting. You’ll see the framing I mentioned above as the two stationary figures stand still as the rain cuts crosswise, leaves drifting gently in the wind. They face off at a distance, two noble warriors preparing to do battle. The first time this happened I had chills and goosebumps. These moments are a highlight of the game, and I looked forward to every once of them.Beyond duels, you’ll also test your skill in standoffs. Approaching enemies you are welcome to snipe them from a distance, sneak up on them, and otherwise dispatch them as you see fit, but you can also hit up on the D-pad to initiate a standoff. Facing your foes head on, you’ll leave your sword in its scabbard, prepared for Iaijutsu — the art of drawing your sword and destroying your opponent with a single stroke. Holding the triangle button, your foes will approach and prepare to strike. They may attack immediately, taunt you, or otherwise try to feint to draw your attack. Attack too early or too late and your enemy will get the drop on you, heavily damaging you. Time it right, however, and you’ll cut down nearly any foe in the blink of an eye. As your skills grow, you may draw even more foes in this way, allowing you to thin their ranks rapidly and efficiently. While stealth is rewarding in its own way, I enjoyed standoff showdowns immensely.Not unlike God of War, Ghost of Tsushima features a toggle for PlayStation Pro owners to select between prioritizing framerate or resolution. Prioritizing resolution puts the game at 4K resolution with a framerate that tries its best to hold to 30fps. Framerate does what it suggests, locking the resolution at 1080p, but unlocking the framerate to something approaching 60 — not unlike Infamous: Second Son. There are certainly dips at the resolution-focused setting, and it’s frequent enough where it ceases to be worth using fairly quickly as it mars the otherwise beautiful presentation of the game. Set it on framerate-focused and enjoy the game instead. Neither one will fix one of the other technical hiccups — the mechanical drive struggles to load the 3D models for cosmetic previews for upgrades and such (though it’s thankfully never an issue during gameplay), but with PlayStation 5 backwards compatibility and SSDs, this game could benefit from the additional power and speed of Sony’s upcoming platform.There is a concept in Japan called wabi-sabi, or the acceptance of transience and imperfection. There are a few hiccups in Ghost of Tsushima. One quest named The River Children asks you to investigate a mystery on a river dock which causes Jin to freeze in place and just endlessly gaze upon a blood streak, or a half-eaten fish. I had to come back more than a dozen times before the mission triggers finally let me complete it. Highly zen, I’m sure, but it does mean that this side story doesn’t work the way it is supposed to. Occasionally I’d jump onto a rock surface, causing Jin to levitate as he tries to find his footing. This has always self-corrected, thankfully, eventually sliding Jin to a solid surface. Similarly, I’ve had situations where the game was insistent I was in battle, preventing fast travel, no matter how far away I rode or how many enemies I slayed. Restarting the game resolved this. All of that said, these minor imperfections are insignificant in the face of what is a true masterpiece.I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention that you can play Ghost of Tsushima in English, or in Japanese with English subtitles. You can also play in “Kurasawa mode” which gives the game a black and white filter with authentic film grain pops. The voice work in this game is pretty stellar, but hearing it in Japanese takes it to a new level. It’s the sort of thing that I’m guessing a lot of people will skip, and it must have been insanely expensive, but it drives home the Kurasawa influence that is infused in all parts of this game.It’s a bit meta, but part of reviewing a game is knowing that you likely won’t have the time to hit every objective in time for release. Ghost of Tsushima hooked me so completely that I had to finish everything. I’ve found every Shinto Temple shrine, tameshigiri (bamboo cutting) stand, hot spring, Kami shrine, found and upgraded every piece of armor and weapon, wrote every haiku, solved every tale (side missions), maxed out all skills, uncovered every Pillar of Honor (collectible sword cosmetics), and lit every lighthouse. I humbly offer my own haiku as I close the book on this phenomenal adventure.Blossoms in the wind

Ghost of Tsushima,Keza MacDonald,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/jul/14/ghost-of-tsushima-review-samurai-thrills-kurosawa-cinematic-combat,"PS4; Sucker Punch/Sony Visually rich design brings cinematic scope to this historical action game, but when sword-fighting brings diminishing rewards, console yourself with a haikuCreated by devoted admirers of Japanese samurai cinema at Sucker Punch Productions in Washington, Ghost of Tsushima turns the feudal world of Akira Kurosawa films into a huge, absurdly beautiful game, set during the Mongol invasion of the island of Tsushima in the 13th century. Samurai Jin Sakai, an unlikely survivor of the incursion’s first beachside battle, reluctantly turns to underhanded tactics in his efforts to repel the invaders and save his homeland, sneaking through long grass and hiding on rooftops to assassinate Mongols as well as confronting them sword-to-sword in clashing duels.All the aesthetic and thematic conventions of samurai films are present and correct: a story centred on honour and self-mastery; dramatic weather that sweeps across Japan’s spellbinding landscapes; standoffs against backdrops of falling leaves and deserted towns; screen wipe and axial cuts; quick, lethal katana combat that ends with enemies staggering and spurting blood before toppling like felled trees. It can even be played with a grainy black-and-white Kurosawa filter, or entirely in Japanese (though the lip syncing is matched to the English script).This is an unimpeachably gorgeous rendition of Japan’s incomparable natural beauty. A temple resides in a grove of trees whose golden leaves filter the light; red maples and blue hydrangeas stand out against fields of pampas grass. Riding through this marvellous scenery on horseback, you slowly conquer a map forested with Mongol encampments, scenic viewpoints, occupied fishing villages and shrines, unlocking gunpowder grenades, kunai and smoke bombs to use alongside Jin’s katana and bow as his legend grows.Ghost of Tsushima offers some elegant solutions to the superficial problems with huge, open games like this. Instead of little icons and mini-maps cluttering up the screen and making you feel like you’re playing a satnav, brushing a thumb across the controller’s touch-pad summons a wind that ripples the long grass and guides you to your next destination. Instead of map markers, you can follow golden birds towards interesting places – that is, if they don’t get stuck up against a building or a cliff and disappear.Other, deeper problems remain, however: repetition, bloat and boredom. Ghost of Tsushima follows a dispiritingly familiar trajectory of a frustrating first few hours, where enemies are powerful and everything is difficult; an exciting middle act where the game feels thrillingly conquerable; and a tedious latter half where enemies fall like skittles before you. Later-game character upgrades let you automatically parry sword strikes or stagger enemies in a couple of swipes, with the counterproductive consequence that the longer you play for, the less skill is required to prevail. Before very long, I was thoughtlessly tearing through 10 Mongols at a time instead of thinning them out carefully before confronting the final few in a true samurai stand-off.As the novelty of infiltrating forts and clashing blades started to fade a few evenings in, it became increasingly clear that the story wasn’t enough to keep me interested. This is a long game, and it moves slowly. Jin Sakai is stiff even by stoical samurai standards, and the tension between his sense of integrity and the guerrilla tactics he must employ doesn’t drum up much intrigue. “There is no honour in this,” he muses soberly, as I stab what must surely be the 400th Mongol in the back. Perhaps not, Jin, but it’s certainly expedient, and we have a lot of these guys to kill.Even the side quests, where the good stuff is often to be found in open-world games like this, show a disappointing lack of imagination. Some farmers have asked me to escort them up the road but lo! We are ambushed by bandits. Best track down this peasant’s missing family member – oh no! They are dead. I must admit that when, after slaughtering untold hordes and successfully storming an actual castle, I was asked to collect some moss for someone, I rather lost the will to go on.Unlike Assassin’s Creed, which always uses its historical settings as stages for its own eccentric stories, Ghost of Tsushima sticks so closely to the tropes and storylines of classic samurai fiction that it sometimes forgets to have a personality of its own. After I caught myself repeatedly checking my phone out of boredom during the story missions, I decided to abandon them entirely for a while and had a great time chasing foxes, bathing in hot springs, composing deeply average haiku and climbing mountains in search of a legendary bow instead. This is the most beautiful version of Japan ever conjured in code, and when running errands and slashing Mongol spearmen to bits gets tedious, you can always just drink in the view.Ghost of Tsushima is out on 17 July; £54.99."

			Sucker Punch's PS4 tribute to Akira Kurosawa is gorgeous to behold but its sparse open-world and bloated mechanics has it falling short
		It doesn’t require a military strategist of the caliber of Sun Tzu to discern that one of Sony’s most successful tactics in this generation’s great console war has been their commitment to exclusive games. Indeed, Microsoft’s increasingly forced attempts to focus attention onto tech specs can be read as an attempt to deflect from years of neglecting their first party development studios. The choice between a few extra teraflops of processing power or being able to play Uncharted 4 and God of War proved not to be a hard one to make, and gamers flocked to Sony’s banner in their millions. Not all Sony Worldwide Studios are created equal, though. Sucker Punch Productions started the PS4 era with so-so superpowers sequel, Infamous Second Son. As with many launch window titles - including stablemate Killzone: Shadow Fall - its style and substance ratios were completely out of kilter, the devs interpreting their next gen remit as a licence to dial up the scale and spectacle at the expense of any genuine gameplay innovation. Killzone developers Guerilla Games learned their lessons well, though, and went on to release the critical and commercial phenomenon Horizon Zero Dawn in 2017. Sucker Punch have set their sights similarly high with swords and samurai blockbuster Ghost of Tsushima - but ultimately their arrows have fallen short of the mark. And for all too familiar reasons.Much like their previous game, Ghost of Tsushima certainly looks the part. In fact, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say Sucker Punch’s bucolic take on feudal Japan is one of the most beautiful virtual worlds ever created; the variety and verisimilitude of flora is captured with an old master’s eye, while the atmospheric effects are almost literally godlike. Even after dozens of hours of playtime you’ll still regularly stumble across a dazzling dawn vista or lightning-streaked stormscape which will literally stop you in your tracks. Photo Modes are commonplace nowadays but Ghost of Tsushima genuinely demands one. Such beauty is rarely more than skin deep, alas, and beneath the game’s sublime surface lies a much more mundane experience. It’s not that there’s not much to do; if anything Ghost of Tsushima has too much substance. It’s just not enough of it is all that interesting. Ghost’s main storyline is passable pot-boiling fare. Having seen his kin all but wiped out by invading Mongol marauders and himself been left for dead on a beach in the first reel, Jin Sakai embarks on a one-samurai mission to take back control of the island of Tsushima. It transpires Jin’s most difficult opponent isn’t actually pantomime villain Khotun Khan but rather his own kind’s rigid honour code. To level the battlefield, Jin is tempted to embrace the darker arts of the ninja, a genuinely intriguing concept which frustratingly often feels more in service to the gameplay mechanics than the plot. And boy are there a lot of mechanics to serve. Ghost of Tsushima is a riot of overlapping systems - and rarely in a good way. Core combat, for example, is ostensibly great. Jin can dodge and parry his way through throngs of assailants with the aid of four sword stances, each of which corresponds to the four main classes of adversary and comes with weapon-specific counter attacks. Switching between them on the fly when surrounded by murderous Mongols armed with swords, spears and shields adds strategic spice to dust ups. However, Jin also has an arsenal of side weapons, ranging from bows to blowpipes and knives to bombs, and there are forests of skill trees, incremental upgrades and special moves to manage, as well as dozens of largely interchangeable gear bonuses and attribute boosters. In an effort to facilitate as many playstyles as possible Sucker Punch have only succeeded in creating an unwieldy mess which ultimately discourages experimentation. It’s a shame because some of the creative decisions taken here are inspired. In lieu of a minimap, Jin uses the wind to navigate Tsushima, the billowing leaves and bending fields of pampas grass subtly denoting your path like a 13th century SatNav. Likewise the ‘Standoff’ system for starting fights, which sees Jin enter into a lethal game of chicken with his foes where a well-timed button press results in an instant, slow motion evisceration, is exhilarating - right up until the point endless repetition transforms it into a dreaded chore. This last complaint is a symptom of Ghost’s biggest and most fundamental flaw. Having crafted this enormous, wondrous world, Sucker Punch have singularly failed to fill it with interesting things to do. Tsushima itself feels empty, all flora and no fauna, its lush landscapes disappointing devoid of life save for randomly spawning pockets of enemy soldiers, or its extremely limited species of wildlife. In stark contrast to the glorious art direction, stepping off Ghost’s main path rarely serves up sights worth seeing. Side quests are repetitive and largely forgettable and while there are literally hundreds of collectibles and a handful of stat-boosting mini-games and sub-Tomb Raider challenge shrines to seek out, most involve riding to a map marker, collecting whatever tat you find there, and triggering one of a handful of rote animations you’ll come to dread like the approach of a stranger with a dry cough. Ultimately Ghost of Tsushima offers a lot of breadth but precious little depth. At its best, usually when Jin is swinging a sword in the midst of a mass brawl, it occasionally brings to mind Hidetaka Miyazaki’s superlative samurai Soulsbourne offering, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. But if that game was the work of an authentic auteur, then this is the big budget Hollywood remake - more accessible and much easier on the eye for sure, but with almost none of the charm or character. And as Sony and Microsoft’s generals martial their troops ahead of a new console skirmish, Ghost of Tsushima also offers a timely warning: the next generation of games will need more than gorgeous graphics to win the war. "
Ghost of Tsushima,Zachary Atwood,Gaming Nexus,https://www.gamingnexus.com/Article/6140/Ghost-of-Tsushima/,"Samurai fantasy is a very real thing. After years of games like Assassin's Creed exploring various historical periods, many people have been craving a foray into feudal Japan. Ghost of Tsushima fills this need with a more traditional action-adventure take on the samurai lore.The best part of the game is the island of Tsushima itself. The game world is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen. Every part of the map feels carefully crafted, with tremendous thought put into the visual design. The result is a world that begs to be explored. I spent hours at a time simply wandering the land, excited to see each new area. The game uses color excellently, providing vivid and diverse landscapes that are both beautiful and functional, allowing players to easily determine where they are on the map. Pairing all that up with a day/night cycle and a variable weather system, you get a perfect storm that makes the entire world of Tsushima feel vibrant and alive.The visual design of Tsushima isn't the only thing that makes it feel alive. Towns and villages scattered across the map are filled with villagers you can talk to. As you interact with them, the information they provide can reveal points of interest and new quests. It's a nice alternative to the tiresome trend of chasing an endless string of question marks all over the map. The game promotes natural exploration, rewarding players with more than just breathtaking views. Whether you're writing Haiku, following foxes to a shrine, or ascending a temple path, almost every activity in the open world rewards armor, a skill point, or an equipment upgrade. Loot aside, exploring Tsushima is its own reward. There's a real sense of tranquility that comes from most of the activities the player can engage in. I often found myself stopping to explore more after a particularly intense mission or fight.Ghost of Tsushima's story focuses on a Mongol invasion of Tsushima in the 13th century. Players take on the role of samurai Jin Sakai as he fights to free his home from the Mongol occupation. Although it starts a bit slow, the story ramps up in the later acts. It's good all the way through, but some of the arcs in the later parts of the game can be downright gut-wrenching. The story is fragmented into different pieces called tales. Each tale can have multiple missions and generally focus on the stories of Jin's multiple allies.In isolation, the tales are some of the best parts of the game and give great human connection to Jin and those he allies with. One of the best features of the story and the tales that come with it is how well it illustrates Jin's internal conflict as he is forced to adapt to defeat the Mongols. I won't venture too far down this path to avoid spoilers, but it's worth mentioning that the narrative of the story intertwines perfectly with the introduction of different gameplay mechanics.Combat, much like the story, is a slow starter. In the beginning, it's what you'd typically expect from an open-world action-adventure game. Players can use a light or heavy attack, dodge, and parry. Most combat cues are visual, so it quickly became repetitive once I got a handle on the different enemy types. Early on, I found most of the difficulty was getting used to targeting without a lock-on feature and making sure I was careful not to fight too many enemies at once.As the game progresses and you get more upgrades, the game's power fantasy comes alive. There are several paths to explore as far as weapon and equipment upgrades go, and they all felt largely viable when I started putting points into them. Between weapon stances and the different equipment like kunai and smoke bombs, I found that I was able to work in my playstyle throughout the whole game.Hands down, the best combat feature in the entire game is the standoff mechanic. When you approach a group of enemies you can trigger a standoff. Once initiated, you challenge a single enemy to a fight. As they begin their attack you can retaliate to eliminate them in a single blow, and then traditional combat begins. The maneuver isn't without risk, however, as mistiming your attack causes you to take massive damage. It's a tremendously good feeling to nail a standoff, and the additional upgrades you can get allow you to chain together standoff kills, reducing the enemy numbers by a few before combat even starts. Ghost of Tsushima is, of course, filled to the brim with samurai references, but the standoff functionality takes my award for the thing in the game that made me feel the most like a samurai.The stealth in Ghost of Tsushima is an interesting mechanic. As a lover of stealth games, I went in expecting to challenge myself to play as much of the game in stealth as possible. Although I think this is technically possible, it doesn't feel like it's the way that stealth was meant to be used throughout the game. The implementation is pretty similar to other games, featuring assassination, visual detection meters, and a ""ghost"" sense allowing you to detect enemy movement through walls.After trying to fully commit stealth in a few different areas, I found that it felt more like the stealth was meant to be used as a tool to thin out enemies. This runs parallel to things like standoffs, which allow you to whittle down the enemy numbers before committing to the full fight. There are a few encounters throughout the game that require stealth, but they seemed to be designed in a way that facilitates it, more like a puzzle than traditional stealth gameplay. More often than not, I found myself using stealth to eliminate a few key enemies before initiating a standoff, just to make the ensuing fight easier. Not to mention that some of the key thematic elements of the game make choosing between stealth and traditional combat an impactful choice concerning Jin's perceived code of honor. Kudos to Sucker Punch on that, as it's not often I play a game where I feel an emotional response to how I choose to dispatch enemies.Although these don't fit perfectly into any of the categories above, there are a few minor details in the game I wanted to focus on. First, the use of wind as a guidance system. Rather than a mini-map, compass, and a waypoint, the wind simply guides you to your current objective. It's such a  simple and elegant solution, and that alone removes so much visual clutter from the screen. Plus, it creates a sense of directionality. It gives me something to move toward but doesn't insist that I go that way now. The use of the wind as a guide unconsciously reminded me that I didn't need to rush to where I was going.Next is the controller touchpad. I don't play a ton of games on the PS4, but Ghost of Tsushima has to be one of the best uses of the touchpad I've seen so far. It binds with the wind mechanic, allowing you to create a gust of wind towards your objective with a quick swipe of the pad. Other than that, it governs some simple actions like sheathing, bowing, and playing the flute. It balances the simplicity of function with useful mechanics and even has some visual clues in-game that can help remind you what it does if you forget.The last thing I'll talk about is an extremely minor detail that feels like such a perfect addition to the game. As a longtime player of action-adventure and RPG games, I'm all too familiar with the quandary of keeping pace with an NPC. It seems like on every ""walk with me"" quest, the NPC either moves slightly faster or slower than me. It's immensely frustrating having to constantly stop and start to keep pace. Ghost of Tsushima seems to effortlessly solve this problem by just having NPCs match your pace. This seems simple, but it also occurs when the NPC is leading you, as they'll just stay a bit ahead of you regardless of which speed you choose to go. It's such a small thing, but it makes all those missions go so much smoother when you're not playing a hidden minigame to make sure you stay on pace with the NPCs.With stunning visuals, a deep and interesting story, and a combat system with more depth than you'd initially expect, the game delivers on a much sought after samurai experience.* The product in this article was sent to us by the developer/company.A Quality Engineer by day, I spend most of my remaining time playing whatever games I can get my hands on.

Ghost of Tsushima,James Paley,COGconnected,https://cogconnected.com/review/ghost-of-tsushima-review/,"Playing Ghost of Tsushima has been a dizzy dance of expectations versus reality. At so many separate junctions, I’ve slammed into what I wanted to happen, blindsided by the actual events. This game wears the fresh skin of an open world RPG, one crammed full of crafting, karmic choices, and skyrocketing power levels. What I expected, and what I experienced, struggled for weeks to reconcile their differences. So much of this is reminiscent of other titles, different ideas, and similar genres. I’ve been confounded at every turn, and yet I’m enamored all the way. That’s the critical sticking point, you see. My assumptions have been thoroughly subverted, and I’ve loved every minute of it.Story spoilers for the first Act of the game follow:Jin Sakai’s tale is also one of unexpected shocks to the system. He ends up being one of the only survivors of a horrific battle against the invading Mongolian army. He’s forced to set aside his code in order to survive. Sneak attacks and subtle arts are not the Samurai way, and yet use them he must. Here is the first of my delusional assumptions laid bare: that I, as Jin, could choose honor over need. With an army on the horizon, one man can’t just charge in and challenge the boss. One man does exactly this, in the opening cutscene. It goes rather poorly. The story goes to great pains to demonstrate, with perfect clarity, that brute force and honor are not going to win this war. I simply failed to see this, at first.Not that there’s only one way to approach each battle. If you’d rather stand outside the gates and demand a deathmatch than sneak in the side, you can do that. As long as there aren’t any hostages to endanger, of course. There are loads of fights that can proceed whichever way you wish, but those major story moments, the ones that change Jin’s whole life? As inevitable as the tides. The lesson being that you can be as bold or as shadowy as you wish, and the narrative will unfold just the same. A part of me expected some sort of karma system, yet I don’t actually begrudge it’s absence. Instead, I’m thankful for the freedom to move through levels however I want. There are some exceptions, though.Jin’s life is first saved by a thief named Yuna. Unlike Jin, she’s all about sneaking around and flashing knives in the dark. She’ll do whatever she has to in order to survive another day. The first time you stab a man in the back, you’re treated to a flashback, with your uncle driving home the importance of fighting with honor. From then on, these two paths are in constant conflict, with each one presenting different benefits and drawbacks. In addition, Yuna’s missions trend towards stealth. Other characters you run with have the same effect on your stories. An expert archer will find more reasons to shoot people with arrows, or more scenarios where this is the perfect course of action. That’s not the only example of organic design at work, either.Ghost of Tsushima’s single greatest innovation is in navigation. There is no minimap. Instead, the wind will blow towards your chosen destination. This means that you’re no longer staring at one tiny section of the screen all day, being free to take in every scene from top to bottom. This also makes every section a little more moody, a little more suffused with atmosphere. There’s no area so beautiful it can’t be improved with a lonesome breeze and some well-placed particle effects. Gone are the old days of countless glowing icons cluttering your UI. Simply follow the wind! I can’t overstate how much this changes the way you travel. Plus, every time you choose a new destination, a massive gust blows through the area. It’s both beautiful and practical.  Even the sidequests are more streamlined and sleek.Here’s where things get slightly contentious. Side missions and activities are always some blend of exploration, investigation, and combat. This means that knocking off several in one sitting is a snap. This also means the emotional impact of certain quests is softened. Seeing a hapless peasant learn the grim fate of their family is less overwhelming the sixth or seventh time around. The main narrative has some sharp fangs when it comes to story beats. This just doesn’t always come through in the side content. I found myself smashing through some of these missions with little feeling, but at least doing so was well-paced and rather convenient. You know what never gets old, though? The combat.You can’t do a proper old-school Samurai epic without some amazing sword fights, and Ghost of Tsushima has these in spades. Every battle is a chance for you to showcase your blossoming skills. There are multiple stances to switch between, and you need every one of them to survive. Most enemy types go from punishing to pathetic with the right stance. You can even switch in the middle of a sword swing, though the enemy can interrupt this action. Even a small pack of goons can end your life if they catch you flat-footed. There are always arrows and bombs to even the score, but you need a chance to get them out first. You can sneak, strategize, and scrape your way through most any fight, but duels are a different story.You want to survive a duel, there’s no trickery that can save you. Instead, you need to unleash every sword skill you’ve learned up to this point. Blocks, dodges, parries, and offensive techniques all have to make an appearance. Whereas other battles slowly got easier, duels stayed very ‘skin of my teeth.’ In fact, the game’s final duel took me the better part of an hour to complete. Your mileage may vary, but I faced no greater threat than a truly competent swordsman. Here, the game’s complex combat system was in perfect form. Every clash is chess, bolstered by peerless reflexes and intense pressures. You have countless moves to choose, and fragments of seconds to make them in. I found myself wandering into Mongol camps just for the chance to fight more. I can’t walk away from a duel until it’s been won, and even the losses feel like they’re teaching me something. Even exploration missions are compelling, due to how beautiful the game is.As a regular PS4 user, I’ve accepted the slightly inferior look of my games. I can live with the knowledge that certain textures are crispier, cleaner, better behaved on someone else’s console. It’s hard to believe this game could look any better, however. There are games out there with better graphics, yes. Maybe the hair is more detailed, or the horses look perfect, or the NPC models are more complete. But I am constantly – constantly – struck by how gorgeous this game is. Even thirty hours in, I’ll be climbing some ridge, the sun low in the sky, the grass shimmering with twilight, and I’ll slam on the brakes. After a couple minutes spent soaking in the scenery I’ll move on, but a little regretfully. Everything from the winds, to the low music, to the skies full of thunder and smoke, to the soaring birds, helps make the island that much more beautiful. If you’re looking for prime places to take photos, you’ll go crazy. They’re absolutely everywhere. Even without color, the visuals are incredible. Some would say more so, in fact.Cinematic, or Kurosawa mode, makes the entire game look and sound like an old Samurai movie. It’s all monochrome, complete with film grain effects and slight changes to the audio. There’s also more particle effects added to the wind, which makes every scene utterly momentous. In spite of the name, this doesn’t make the whole game feel like a Kurosawa film. Only every single cutscene. I switched modes throughout my playthrough, but there’s a strong case to be made for a full Kurosawa mode run. I’ve even started watching old Samurai movies, so I can better appreciate the homage. Without getting too far into spoiler territory, let’s unpack the story. By which I mean the writing, the acting, and the music. Every disparate element works together to keep this tale moving forward. In fact, helpless forward momentum is kind of the theme here. Or maybe it’s just choice and consequence finding you in the shadows where you sleep. Maybe it’s just about identity. I loved the story, both for how it impacted me, and how it didn’t overstay its welcome. Jin Sakai’s journey through Tsushima feels so natural it’s almost inevitable. Never did I wonder why he made the choices he did. If not the only option, it was the best bad move he could make. Rather than burden me with choices throughout the story, I was left to try and understand why Jin did what he did at every turn. In the end, I feel like I understood him, just a little.I wanted this game to be so many things. Ghost of Tsushima takes great care to sidestep these ideas, delivering instead a wholly separate experience. There’s no Karma system, leaving me to grapple with the horrors of war and the inescapable tide of destiny. The RPG elements are sparse and simple, offering the player more freedom to master the vast combat mechanics. Even the open world elements are pared down, with greater emphasis placed on exploration and quiet contemplation. Once I successfully reconciled my expectations with my reality, the game revealed itself as a compelling, masterful work of art. Nothing feels useless or extraneous. The story wastes little time, the fights are all exuberant and engaging, the exploration is addicting, and the entire game is gorgeous. I can think of no better game to be the swan song for the PS4.***A PS4 code was provided by Sony Interactive Entertainment***Developer: Sucker PunchPublisher: Sony Interactive Entertainment"
Ghost of Tsushima,Alessio Palumbo,Wccftech,https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-tsushima-duty-heavier-than-a-mountain-death-lighter-than-a-feather/,"It's been over six years since developer Sucker Punch Productions released Infamous: Second Son in March 2014, which means the studio has a lot to prove with Ghost of Tsushima.Fans were frankly hoping to be able to play a couple of years ago, but it eventually became the last big PlayStation 4 first-party exclusive, out only a few months ahead of the launch of the PlayStation 5 console.This makes Ghost of Tsushima a particularly interesting case study of how the same console hardware can produce massively improved results at the end of the generation, when the developers have had time to figure out how to squeeze every ounce of power out of it through sheer experience. That's been true of every console generation and likely the same will occur with the upcoming next-generation, with the first wave of titles only providing a mere glimpse of what will be possible later on.As you might have guessed by now, our time with Ghost of Tsushima demonstrated a much better, not to mention much more engrossing, open world game when compared to Infamous: Second Son. In fact, when all is said and done, this could be regarded as Sucker Punch's finest work yet, both in terms of critical reception and sales, in a similar way to what Horizon Zero Dawn did for Guerrilla Games and Marvel's Spider-Man for Insomniac.That's not to say Ghost of Tsushima is particularly innovative in the open world genre, but it is hard to hold it against a game this polished and compelling. You'll find many of the usual trappings seen in other major open world games here, though they have been mostly well-disguised and adjusted for the setting so that they feel appropriate. Then again, those aforementioned fellow first-party titles didn't really focus on innovations, either.Ghost of Tsushima can be best described as an action/adventure with light RPG elements, again much like Horizon Zero Dawn and Marvel's Spider-Man. Whereas Guerrilla's title focuses mainly on long-range combat and Insomniac's one mainly on melee combat, however, Ghost of Tsushima features a more even mix of fighting styles and it will be ultimately up to the player to pick and choose in the moment-to-moment action.Trained to be an outstanding samurai by his uncle Lord Shimura (the jito, or steward, of Tsushima), over the course of the game protagonist Jin Sakai can also access stealth options, archery (shortbow as well as longbow), and a variety of tools ranging from smoke and black powder bombs to poison and hallucination darts.Every aspect of the combat feels deep and fleshed out. As a result, the action can often be thrilling once you've mastered all the many ways to defeat Mongols at Jin's disposal. An individual aspect could probably be found ever so slightly wanting compared to the gaming gold standards of melee and stealth, but rarely has there been such a complete and well-rounded package in the hands of players.Melee combat, for instance, requires almost perfect timing when it comes to parries and dodges. Enemies aren't nearly as deadly as those seen in the Soulsborne games, mind you, but it does take quite a bit of finesse to avoid taking too much damage even at the default difficulty. Swordfighting feels amazingly satisfying to boot, thanks to the fluid and great to see animations.There are four sword stances to be unlocked in the game, which can be done by killing and/or observing enemy leaders as they train in their outposts. These can be switched in real time and their main use is to be able to stagger and thus break the guard of a specific type of enemy; for example, Stone stance is optimal against swordsmen, while Water stance is geared towards shield-wielding enemies. However, even setting aside all of the other tools and weapons at disposal, you don't actually need to switch all the time once you're good enough at telling the exact attack timing of your foes. Perfect parries and dodges alone are an excellent way to beat almost every enemy, and you can also perform jump attacks at the right time to catch your opponent off guard.Stealth is often a very rewarding approach, especially since you'll generally have to deal with plenty of enemies. As is the case with many games that have some form of stealth, there is a meter that fills up before Jin gets spotted. At that point, you can still silence the alerted enemy before they sound the alarm (a war horn), calling for reinforcements. Even when you've been spotted by multiple opponents, a smoke bomb will let you re-enter stealth if needed.Perhaps the highlight of the stealth design is how it is woven into the layout of all buildings. You've got the option to sneak into an occupied house from multiple trapdoors, and that comes in handy when you have to avoid being seen at all costs in order to prevent the execution of some prisoners.One specific standout feature added to Ghost of Tsushima by Sucker Punch is that of 'Stand-offs'. Whenever first approaching an enemy force, Jin will be given the opportunity to openly challenge one of them (automatically picked by the game) to a one-versus-one duel.Activating the option will basically put you into a mini-game of sorts where you'll be required to press down the triangle button while focusing very carefully on your foe's movements. The triangle has to be released only when the enemy has just begun performing his strike, or you'll not only fail to kill him but also get severely damaged in the process.Later on, foes will be able to perform feints (even multiple ones), which could throw you off. Conversely, Jin will get the chance to extend his 'streak' and one-shot a few enemies who rush in as soon as he wins the duel, though even here you'll have to time the swing of your katana accordingly in order to succeed in killing them.This plays into the overall samurai movie vibe, which is reinforced by the sheer quantity of duels available in Ghost of Tsushima. Most 'boss fights' happen under this set of rules, where you'll have nothing but your trusted katana blade as your weapon, as 'Ghost' weapons and even bows become temporarily unavailable in order to enforce an honorable fight according to samurai code.Here, the camera shifts back and forth, as if in a Western movie during those sun-drenched O.K. Corral style shootouts, highlighting each duelist's expressions and subtle movements as they prepare to unsheath their blades. It's incredibly effective in its cinematic goal, though some players (myself included) might have liked an option to skip this brief cutscene after the tenth duel or so.As hinted by the very title of the game and briefly showcased during pre-release footage, Ghost of Tsushima's plot is heavily centered on Jin Sakai's journey from a samurai into the 'Ghost', a warrior willing to do whatever it takes to rid his island of the Mongol invaders.After the crushing defeat suffered by the samurai army on the beach of Komoda, Jin realizes that adhering to the samurai way of waging a war simply won't cut it against the vast and ruthless army led by Khothun Khan, a fictional cousin of the real Kublai Khan. It is important to note that even though the gameplay of Ghost of Tsushima lets you choose whether to approach fights stealthily, head-on, or anything in between, the story is fixed and will therefore not take into account how you're actually playing, in contrast to Sucker Punch's own 'Karma' system seen in inFamous 2.While rewinding the main story, it is hard to pinpoint any real twists or surprises. Every major event was fairly predictable in its outcome, which means those who absolutely need to be surprised by at least a big twist might feel a little disappointed in that regard. However, the plot is otherwise expertly told and narrated, thanks to excellent voice actors and motion capture.Furthermore, Sucker Punch did succeed in creating a memorable cast of characters, something that's arguably the most important part of any fictional story. These are fleshed out through a series of tales (the game's official name for quests) specifically dedicated to each of Jin's allies and friends, as you help them find their own way. Even here, the developers have surely outdone themselves compared to their previous works, and the stories told rarely turn out to be as black and white as they first appear.Content-wise, Ghost of Tsushima certainly impressed during the playthrough. Its map (divided into three zones, Izuhara, Toyotama and Kamiagata, that are unlocked as you progress through the story) is simply huge and there's a lot to do, more than enough in fact to keep most players occupied for dozens of hours.Beyond the main tale and the aforementioned 'ally' side content, there are also a great number of secondary tales. Sucker Punch devised a rather interesting way to point out these local tales for the player. When you manage to free civilians who've been captured by the Mongols, they'll often reward you with rumors of what has been going on in the vicinity, or possibly how they were captured in the first place, which will put the rumored location on your map. Again, even it's not quite a revolutionary feature, it's a nice way to organically weave side content into an open world design.Perhaps the most interesting ones are the 'mythic' tales. These are multi-step quests where Jin uncovers the truth behind long-lost legendary items and combat techniques, such as the 'Dance of Wrath', the 'Heavenly Strike', or the 'Way of Flame', which are all incredibly cool and powerful additions to Jin's already impressive skill set.Much like in the open world titles seen in the past years, there are also random events occurring throughout the island. These can range from simple patrols to more structured ones, such as a local inhabitant warning Jin that the Mongols are cutting down a sacred forest nearby to get wood for their ships.Overall, side content may not be on par with the quality seen in The Witcher 3 (which remains the pinnacle of the open world genre in that area), but it's not too far off either and it certainly is no letdown.Exploration is very much rewarded, too, and it is nicely entrusted to the so-called 'Guiding Wind'. As you can see from the gameplay footage embedded at the end of the review, there are no regular compasses or the like in Ghost of Tsushima. You'll get a notice on the top left of the distance that separates you from the location of the tale that's currently being tracked, but other than that you'll have to rely on looking in which direction the wind blows; this can be refreshed with an upward swipe of the Dual Shock 4's touchpad.The Guiding Wind can be upgraded to direct Jin to additional points of interests, such as fox dens, which are huge, old trees where you'll find cute little foxes who are really messengers of the kami Inari, one of the principal kami (spirit or holy power) of the Shinto religion. These foxes then proceed to lead Jin to a nearby shrine, which will initially increase the number of charms he can carry at one time, and then the power of said charms.Separately, there are also torii gates that, just like in the real world, lead to Shinto shrines. However, here the paths to these shrines have been disrupted, which is the excuse to entice the player to do some good old climbing, jumping, and grappling (once you've unlocked the hook) to get to the top. Since the effort here is on another level, the charms provided are supposedly stronger as well, though I personally found the bonuses provided to be disappointing and therefore kept using the 'minor' charms.But that's not all, as Ghost of Tsushima also features hot springs sprinkled throughout the island and places of contemplation where he gets to write haikus. In both cases, Jin has the chance to reflect on some of the most recent events of the story; hot springs also enhance the maximum health, while writing a haiku unlocks a new headband.More traditional is the gathering in Ghost of Tsushima. There'll be supplies, steel, linen, iron and whatnot scattered throughout practically every settlement or little house you encounter. These will be required by the bowyer, armorer, and swordsmith NPCs in order to upgrade Jin's weapons and armor to their maximum potential.Jin's melee weapon of choice always remains his trusted Sakai clan katana, by the way, and that's understandable for story reasons. However, there are plenty of different armor sets offering specific perks. Some are tailored for archery or stealth, others are sturdier (letting Jin soak more incoming damage) or nimbler (giving him a melee damage boost).Of course, it'd be hard to speak about Ghost of Tsushima without ever mentioning its absolutely impressive visuals. To be honest, during the first hour or so of the playthrough, some of the weaker aspects were noticeable too. Specifically, texture work isn't quite as outstanding as someone who regularly plays on PC on Ultra settings with 16x Anisotropic Filtering is accustomed to. Still, once you absorb the whole picture, it is hard not to feel in awe at times.There are some fantastic vistas of Tsushima island here, several of which you can glimpse in the screenshots attached to this review. The lighting, including the volumetric one, is stunning to say the least. Part of the merit goes to the artists, too, who have designed a rendition of Tsushima island so beautiful to elicit a strong desire to go visit the real place one day. The colors are warm and vibrant, though if that's not your thing there's always the option to play the entire game in the 'Akira Kurosawa mode', which adds black bars, black-and-white filters and a number of other tweaks to make the game look like one of the famed director's movies.The optimization work is remarkable as well. On PlayStation 4 Pro, gamers have the ability to pick between the now familiar 'enhanced visuals' or 'enhanced frame rate' modes, but I never felt any need to go with the latter because of the great frame rate consistency even in the enhanced visuals mode.Overall, Ghost of Tsushima looks like a masterful example of how to create an open world game tailored around the capabilities (and the weaknesses) of the PlayStation 4.As remarkable as the visuals side of the game is, the audio isn't worth any less. The English voice acting is great, as mentioned above, and there's also the option to use Japanese audio to maximize immersion; additionally, the soundtrack is one of the best I've heard in recent years and may be worth purchasing on its own.Reviewed on PlayStation 4 Pro (code provided by the publisher).Ghost of Tsushima is Sucker Punch's best game yet and a great open world title capable of measuring to some of the biggest names in the genre. The excellent rendition of feudal Japan, along with its well-written characters and story, make Ghost of Tsushima stand out as the last must-have PlayStation 4 exclusive.The links above are affiliate links.

Ghost of Tsushima,Robert Ramsey,Push Square,http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/ghost_of_tsushima,"GuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpGhost of Tsushima2020 9.0Game RatingUser Ratings: 216Our Review: Scroll DownGhost with the mostVersion Reviewed: PS4 Pro / EuropeanWhen the Mongol Empire invaded the Japanese island of Tsushima in 1274, the occupation was nothing short of a massacre. The Mongol army had no reason to respect the island's samurai and their desire for traditional, honourable warfare, and so the natives were quickly and decisively overwhelmed. It was a brutal and bloody chapter in a campaign that would ultimately end in disaster for the Mongols, as the empire would be driven from the Japanese mainland before it could establish any kind of foothold.Ghost of Tsushima is based on the initial invasion of Tsushima island. It opens with the battle of Komoda beach as roughly 80 samurai make a doomed attempt to stand against hundreds of Mongol invaders, fresh from their voyage across the sea. The game's overall tone is more samurai cinema than it is an accurate recreation of historic events, but this is still a grim and often tragic depiction of war.It's a serious and sombre tale, and quite a far cry from the comic book nature of the inFAMOUS series. Ghost of Tsushima tells a surprisingly dark and unapologetically bleak story, and this is reflected in Jin Sakai, its protagonist. Throughout the game's entire 30 hour or so runtime, Jin barely cracks a smile -- and who can blame him? He spends his days slaughtering the invaders that ravaged his home, desperately trying to find some kind of meaning in all the bloodshed.And boy is there a lot of bloodshed. Sucker Punch is clearly proud of the combat system that it's created here, and with good cause. Battles are intensely satisfying affairs, full of deft movement and precise swordplay. Pulling off a perfect parry for the very first time feels incredible -- like you've instantly become a part of the most badass samurai movie that your brain can conjure.But for all of its style, combat is reasonably grounded. It walks a fine line between the contextual one-hit kill counterattacks of old Assassin's Creed games and the skill-based action of something like 2018's God of War. Enemies don't come equipped with overly long health bars -- they will die in a flurry of steel like any normal human would, and a swift slice to the side of the neck is usually enough to get the job done. It's a welcome and refreshing change of pace from the many action RPGs that would have you chip away at your foes for minutes at a time.The only thing that stands in the way of Jin's sword is an enemy's defensive stance. Similar to how things work in Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, breaking an opponent's guard opens them up to often fatal blows. Jin has four different combat stances, each of which boast techniques and attacks that are effective against specific foes. If your opponent has a sturdy looking shield, the water stance, with its fast and fluid combos, is ideal. Switching between these stances is as easy as holding down R2 and hitting the corresponding face button, but the system gives each fight a noticeable and rewarding rhythm as you ebb and flow between Jin's various movesets.Things get even more tactical as Jin's 'Ghost' weapons are introduced. Throwing knives, smoke bombs, sticky explosives, and other deceptive tools give the vengeful samurai a real edge in battle -- especially when you're surrounded by a group of armour-clad Mongols. Combat as a whole is reactive, but it's not Batman Arkham or Shadow of War. You're not just hitting the right buttons at the right time -- you've always got options, free movement, and combos to consider. Any stance can win out against any enemy with patience and timing -- it's just that choosing the right one can make your life a lot easier.As you progress through the game, Jin's abilities develop at a steady pace. Skill trees are linear, but you feel the impact of every technique point that you spend. Every perk has a purpose and adds something new to Jin's arsenal, whether it's the ability to deliver a powerful kick mid-combo or have smoke bombs restore some of your health. Ghost of Tsushima's initial few hours can be rough as you learn the ropes, but watching as Jin slowly blossoms into the island's most feared warrior is character progression done absolutely right.Jin's ascendance into legend is reflected in the story, too. Following the samurai's horrendous defeat at Komoda beach, Jin begins to realise that the honourable martial arts of his people aren't going to cut it against the Mongols. He constantly wrestles with the idea of throwing his samurai code to one side, betraying everything that he knows in order to satisfy his lust for revenge. This is where stealth enters the equation.Equipped with a bow and an especially sharp knife, Jin is capable of wiping out an entire Mongol war camp without being seen. While there are times where you simply can't avoid direct combat -- particularly during the game's fantastic one-on-one boss fights -- remaining stealthy is a very viable strategy, and it all works just as you'd expect. Isolating enemies, observing your foes from the nearest patch of long grass, and striking from the shadows is the name of the game. It's exciting, satisfying stealth, but we dare say that Ghost of Tsushima's combat is so enjoyable that stealth almost feels like a side dish. It can be tasty, but it won't fill you up like the main course will.And this leads us to one of our only gripes with the game -- forced stealth sections. Although they're quite rare, there are moments where raising the alarm results in an instant game over. Thematically these scenarios make sense -- they're situations where secrecy is paramount, and being spotted would ruin Jin's plans. But that doesn't stop them from feeling tired in terms of design. It's not even that these objectives are particularly difficult -- they just feel like a relic from a bygone age of stealth titles, like the Mary Jane missions in Marvel's Spider-Man. Ghost of Tsushima gives you a lot of freedom in how to fight and how to approach your goals -- having all of that taken away feels unnecessarily restrictive.Speaking of freedom, Ghost of Tsushima's open world is a joy to explore. It's without a doubt one of the most picturesque open worlds that we've ever traversed, and it's all brilliantly put together. There's no minimap, so you're always looking for landmarks and following the wind -- an ingenious guidance mechanic that directs you towards your goal with gusts that bend surrounding trees and sweep leaves across the ground. It's beautifully implemented, and together with the game's other weather effects, the wind makes Tsushima feel like a living, breathing place.It's a gorgeous game that demands a top class photo mode -- and Sucker Punch has delivered. Boasting a huge range of editing tools, filters, and more, you'll be snapping the perfect shot in no time at all. And it helps that Ghost of Tsushima likes to embrace quieter moments, despite all of the sword-clashing carnage. Peaceful locations such as hot springs and haiku-inspiring views let you enjoy the relative tranquillity of the island, immersing yourself in the natural sights and sounds of Tsushima.There's something special about stumbling upon a nice place to sit and relax in an open world game. If this were a Ubisoft title, these contemplative spots would be replaced with yet another enemy stronghold. In Ghost of Tsushima, you're actively encouraged to seek out these peaceful places -- and contrasted against the blood-soaked intensity of the game's excellent main story missions, finding them becomes a genuine highlight of the experience.If it wasn't already clear, Ghost of Tsushima is a superb open world title. It takes obvious cues from the likes of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Red Dead Redemption 2, and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, but its feudal Japan setting, consistent tone, and thoroughly enjoyable combat system set it apart from the competition. While there is some open world padding at work here -- there are enemy camps to clear, largely meaningless collectibles to find -- you're never forced to stray from the main story. Every diversion feels natural because of the world's clever design, and the game's character-driven side quests are always worth the effort.Having said all of that, the release can be a little rough around the edges. Its presentation is largely immaculate, but it seems that even Sony's first-party developers can't avoid open world jank entirely. Significant bugs are exceedingly rare, but little hiccups like clipping and glitchy animations aren't uncommon. The game also lacks the kind of extreme detail that we've come to expect from PlayStation Studios. There are times when scenes will simply cut to black rather than show Jin perform a one-off action, for example.Fortunately, performance is rock solid -- at least for the most part. The title offers two graphical modes on PS4 Pro: better resolution or higher frame rate. The latter guarantees a smooth experience, while the former provides super crisp visuals at the cost of some slight frame rate dips during busy scenes. It's perhaps a shame that there's no middle ground, but it's nice to see that no matter how you play, load times are almost non-existent. Loading up a save takes just a few seconds -- a rarity for any open world experience.Last but not least, the game's audio is more than worthy of its own paragraph. For starters, the musical score is fantastic. Battle themes have pounding drums that get the blood pumping, while stealthy segments opt for whispy woodwind melodies. Elsewhere, on the acting side of things, the release can be played in English, or in Japanese with English subtitles. We tried both, and we're happy to report that the English cast do a fine job. In fact, it's the Japanese dub that feels just a tiny bit off -- although it does add a certain authenticity to the title, given the setting. Whichever voice track you choose, you can't really go wrong.Ghost of Tsushima is a joy to play and a joy to behold. Sucker Punch has crafted one of the most memorable open world games of this generation, buoyed by an immensely satisfying combat system and an engaging, dramatic story. Unlike many of its open world peers, it's a refined and focused experience -- gripping and immaculately presented at its best.

When he's not practising combos, he's usually getting lost in the latest 100-hour RPG, or, y'know, replaying The Witcher 3.Comments (153)Hey everyone, thanks for reading the review.If you have any questions about the game or the review, I'll try to answer them. Just make sure to copy me in (@ShogunRok) so I get notified.Cannot wait for this one, it's time to be a samurai@ShogunRok great work Robert. Just waiting for your video review to go live. So excited and happy that this has scored so highly. Sounds like it will be a fitting farewell to the PS4 generation (from SIE at least)Phew I pre-ordered based on what I saw and my love of samurai films. Sounds like it is a game worthy of the hype.Amazing ! I'm happy for Sucker Punch, a lot of people didn't have much faith in them. Great job !I’ll have to get this. Unfortunately it won’t be day 1 though.The ghost with the most. Word up son.The game sounds fantastic, and I can't wait to dig in.Great review!Excellent review. I wasn't expecting a high score to be honest. Glad I pre ordered. Can you confirm if it runs at 60fps on PS4 Pro?Really can't wait, as great technical master piece last of us 2 is , just not getting the same vibe as the first , it's becoming a chore to play and the flashbacks keep spoiling the flow of the game, think I'll get rid of it while I will still get a good price and rebuy when I get ps5N.i.c.e game of the year.its the 👻 ghost playa.9 out of 10.cant wait a modern day masterpiece.word up sonVery very cool looking indeed. I have no gripes with open world tropes as long as the gameplay’s solid, do people say the same about Witcher 3 or Red Dead 2? Good games are good games!@ShogunRok Great review and I'm looking forward to this one on Friday, by higher framerate I'm assuming still 30fps?Already preordered! Didnt read the review to avoid even slight spoilers ( this is my normal routine) but your conclusion was very good news! @shogunrok@Cornaboyzzz. Who didnt have faith in them.i never hear that.i was the one who keep saying that this game will get a 91 on metacritic and goty for the past 2 years.word up sonI was mildly interested before because I was wary of another open world game and the gameplay that was shown a while ago didn't do anything to change that. It actually looked pretty generic. But this review has definitely sparked my interest. It's not going to be a day one though as I have plenty of other games to play rn.Literally been waiting for this review before taking action...pre order now being placed 😊Yeah ime gona wait for sale based on the fact the last of us part 2 got a 10/10 and was a let down I cant help but feel these games are only getting good reviews because there the last games of the generation not like theres any competition is there can see this getting repetitive quickly and to get rid of a mini map in an open world game is stupidity ime out@ShogunRok How is the open world in general? Lots of things to do, or just pretty to look at? Many side quests/events? And if so, is there a lot of repetition? The main worry I've seen is that it's mostly just taking out bandit camps.And big question: Can you cut the grass?Very excited to play this, mines in the post already I hope!I knew it................................... .................................................. From the beginning@carlos82 I believe the better frame rate mode is 30fps, yeah. For a while I thought it might be higher — a solid 45 perhaps — but no, I think it's 30. It's absolutely rock solid on that mode in any case.Finished tlou part 2 just in time 👍Sitting at 84 pm metacrtic but the review from digital downloaded giving it a 6 brings it down and looking at the review it's some woke nonsense wrote by someone who doesn't care about the issues they post, just seems a excuse for clicks and to stroke there own egoYou know it’s a sad year when it’s mostly remakes/re-releases of old games that are the only games worth playing through.Good write up. This game does sound excellent, seems to be pretty much what I wanted a samurai game to be like.@Octane brilliant questions and pretty much what I want to know alsoGood that the side quests are interesting and character driven. Is it a case of quantity over quality or are there quite a lot of them?Also how would you rate the trophy list? Fantastic review btw!@Akurusu what has that got to do with this article? Are you just moaning for the sake of moaning@Octane Open world is full of random events, especially on the roads. Mongol patrols, supply caravans, hostage situations... It's quite lively.There are a lot of side quests — I think there are over 60 in total, most of which are dedicated to specific characters who also play a role in the main story.As for repetition, there is some, but the locations you discover are quite varied. Yes there are bandit camps, but there are also little shrines to meditate at, and some really cool platforming challenges. It's certainly not as one-note as some gameplay might have you believe. Like the review says, there are some beautifully quiet moments.And sadly no, you cannot cut the grass. You can cut through paper doors though!@playstation1995 French forums for the most part, or maybe they were just Xbox fanboys ^^@jdv95 There are just over 60 side quests I believe, and I enjoyed the vast majority of them.Trophy list is great — it's one of those games that just has you do a bit of everything and complete a lot things. I got the Platinum while reviewing it.@RIGORR_MORTIS The Last of Us 2 was technically stunning, but story was grim to play. The reviews of this say it's actually fun, so I'm excited! Definitely agree that I'm wary of glowing reviews after LoU2 being such a let-down. Maybe I'm being naive, but here's hoping it's actually a decent game!@Akurusu What? This is a brand new game that just got a 9/10 in our review.@ShogunRok Alright, that's good to know. I'm still a bit worried that it falls into the open world trap. But I'll give it a shot.I'm definitely docking a point for not being able to cut the grass though!@ShogunRok I have been considering a second play-though of TLOU 2, now my nerves are calming and not so shredded.Your review has given me food for thought though and I'm tempted to invest in Ghosts.Always the same question; as an OLED owner, can you please confirm the presence of a HUD? And if so, is it permanent or appear on and off, as action dictates?And finally, assuming there is a HUD, is it possible to dim it down please?Thanks in advance .@ShogunRok great review@KratosMD I wouldn't go that far... The open world is gorgeous and it's the star of the show for much of the game. It's certainly not there to just house repetitive side content.I'm not sure how we reached that conclusion from a single sentence in an otherwise gushing 9/10 review!@LiamCroftExactly . Really seems to be clutching at straws that dont even exist to find a reason not to like a game, gamers really are the most negative bunch of people@Octane That's fair enough!Can't wait. Not a big fan of forced ""you fail if they see you"" stealth sections but if they're short and there isn't many of them, I can live with them.@Woogy The HUD is actually very minimal by default. Your health bar and resolve meter only appear when you're in combat, and there are no permanent little icons.There's also an even more minimal HUD setting that you can enable, which seems crazy, but it's there. That makes it so your health only appears when you take damage, and interaction icons don't even appear on screen.Hope that helps!Didn't read the review, just the score/summary because, you know, ""spoilers"" hehe. Did the preload a few days ago so I am PUMPED for this one !! Friday can't come fast enough imho. This sounds just like the game I wanted and now it seem to be my dream come true !@ShogunRok What's the general difficulty like? Seen a few comments that it's too easy, but doesn't state what mode they played on (Which always makes me laugh, as it makes the complaint pointless).Thanks.@ShogunRok Buying now.Muchas gracias.Some of the ""gaming journalist"" who gave a mediocre score for Ghost of Tsushima on Metacritic was lazy af. A few actually gave it a low score because they think Sucker Punch is trying to copy Assassin's Creed - a game who has already lost its originality years ago.@ShogunRok WoW that's a Nice amount!@phil_j Three difficulty levels: easy, medium, hard.The harder the difficulty, the more aggressive enemies are. On easy, for example, they tend to attack you one by one, giving you more time to react. On hard, enemies surround you more often and attack together. The timing for parries and perfect parries is also much tighter on harder difficulties.Overall I do think the game gets easier as it goes, purely because you end up with so many options in battle. But I still really loved playing it on medium and hard because the combat comes into its own once you have more techniques and abilities unlocked.And that brings an end to PlayStation Studios's first party output. What a great effort it's been from Killzone Shadowfall to Ghost of Tsushima.@KratosMDNearly ever game out there is influenced one way or another by other games , even the ones you mentioned are influenced by something else. Really hard this day and age to make something that's truly uniqueBy your logic with how many games breath of the wild copied it should of been a 7/10@ShogunRok how is the open world in terms of world building outside of side missions? are there means of enviormental story telling in the open world? I mean things like locations with it's own little story you can piece together via items found in that location or people talking about locations of interest Kinda like red dead etc.@KratosMD That's fair, but I do think that while it takes a lot of cues from other games — what open world game doesn't at this point? — I think it still has a very unique atmosphere and feel. It definitely stands out among more generic open world games like Ubisoft's usual output.Can understand the open world burnout, though. It can be tough ploughing through one open world game after another, especially when they're very familiar in terms of structure.@ShogunRok Is there any verticality when it comes to stealth, such as scaling a building? Or does it mainly rely on tall grass and hiding behind objects on ground level?@ShogunRok Excellent review, sadly (for my wallet) it has confirmed what I already suspected - I'm going to have to buy this game pronto.How is the platinum looking? Do-able?@jdv95 It's quite good actually. While I don't think it's as detailed as something like Red Dead 2, there are still lots of secrets to find and stories to piece together. Some of the bigger side quests in particular tell fantastic stories.A lot of the side quests also have a detective-like feel to them, like the ones in The Witcher 3. You investigate shacks in the middle of nowhere and find clues that tell you what happened, that kind of thing.Like the review says the open world is a joy to explore. So much stuff to find.@Broosh A bit of both. A lot of stealth sections have buildings with roofs that you can clamber across, so there is some verticality. There are also hidden crawlspaces under houses that you can use to your advantage. You can get pretty creative if you want.@Gremio108 Very doable. It's one of those Trophy lists that's about doing a bit of everything and completing all of X. I got the Platinum while reviewing it, and really enjoyed going for it.@ShogunRok oh those are my favorite kind of side quests! again thank youI'm more inclined to go by Eurogamer.net and metro gamecentral who were slightly less gushing over this tbf.Sony finishing the generation strong. This looks incredible. The world looks next gen I cant wait to see it on PS5. Suckerpunch nailed it. Excellent review thankyou.I can't stop shaking!!@ShogunRok Hoo boy, I was hoping you'd say that. That platinum is as good as mineI said the other day in the comments GOT would get a 8/10 minimum, and i was more or less right.This game went Gold a while back so I would imagine it'll have a day one patch, I brought two £35 PSN Cards this morning so I pre-order it and download it tomorrow.@Cornaboyzzz I always had faith in them not made a bad game yet imo.cannot wait for this to arrive Friday sounds great!Nicee, I'll preorder it tomorrow 😃How is the black and white mode? And is their lots of cool samurai clothes to wear?Amazing!... that black and white mode 😍Was watching old Samurai movies over the weekend to get ready - I am even more excited now 😀Looks really good, Im hoping to get around to playing this one.Hey @ShogunRok, if you don't mind me asking, does the game show any signs storywise for a potential DLC down the line, or maybe even an expansion like Uncharted: Lost Legacy and Spiderman: Miles Morales? Not that it would affect my purchase in any way, i loved its conccept and would have probably pre-ordered the game if it wasn't for COVID. Unfortunately, i might have to get it later or on sale, so if DLC and a potential GOTY edition with all DLC included can happen, it would help me out.Based on the fact there is not level gating, no forced open world stuff, I'm sold. It also seems main story is about 25 hours which is perfect for me. Only 100 hour game I give that much time to is CP77. I was planning on waiting on GoT for PS5 launch but its not going to happen. I ready for the weekend!Can't wait to play this come Friday, glad to hear it has a decent trophy list too which is always a nice bonus!Given the game is heavily influenced by Akira Kurosawa I am very happy it appears to have done him/his work justice!Sweet good to hear it's a decent game, was waiting for this review just to see how it's rated, will be picking this up on Friday for sure. Been in a bit of a lull since finishing the last of us so think this is just the ticket to get rid of that. Then after finishing this will probably go for the platinum trophy for last of us.@johncalmc Black and white mode is phenomenal. Almost feels like a different game at times. Even the audio crackles like old movies — it's glorious.And there are lots of cool samurai clothes to find. Loads of great looking cosmetics. Demon masks, straw hats — the lot. More than you could ever need.If no one makes a ""Ghost of Sushi"" joke I'll be very disappointed.I'll be mad, even. I'm just ill-tempura that way.@Cornaboyzzz. Definitely x box fanboys haha.or it could be Nintendo or pc.but people have respect for sucker 👊 punch games.word up son@ShogunRok can you stealth the whole game or are you forced into combat at certain points? Also, is there any difficulty trophies? Great review BTW, can't wait for Friday.@RayNick That's a good question. Overall I think the story does feel very final when it ends. I'm not sure much more could be added on the island of Tsushima itself — I think a DLC would have to go off to mainland Japan or something.That said, I do think there's scope for some kind of expansion. There are maybe two or three locations in the game where nothing really happens, and it made me wonder if they'll feature in a DLC or something. It's very tough to say.I think for now, it might be worth just waiting to see whether Sucker Punch has anything to say. Maybe they'll announce that DLC is in the works, or confirm that there are no plans, now that the embargo is lifted and people can talk about the game. I'm expecting some interviews to go up this week, especially when the game releases on Friday.@Waa-Laa You're forced into combat at multiple points, particularly for boss fights. I think there's probably a lot more combat in this than people realise — I certainly wouldn't call it a stealth game. It's more an action game with stealth elements.That said, you can still be stealthy when the option is there. There are plenty of camps to conquer and you can definitely go full stealth for those.And there are no Trophies related to difficulty. You can play the game on any setting and get the Platinum.@ShogunRok thank you.@ShogunRok Okay but now I need the most vital piece of information... you know how you can find cool clothes? Are the cool clothes tied to stats, so like, if I want the best stats, I have to wear the pink socks with the orange tracksuit and the bucket for a helmet, or can I just pick whatever looks coolest?Thrilled that the black and white mode rocks. Blatantly playing in that with the subtitles on.Just love!Hope it's as good as the review says, was left sour by Last of Us 2 and Second Son.@ShogunRokSuperb review, someone played the whole game!? 🤠“I got the Platinum while reviewing it”Respectis it not a bit stale and dated to call a game and define a game as 'open world' just because it does have an open map, I'm not entirely sure what the alternative would be but just my thoughts@ShogunRok Apologies if this has already been covered, but can you confirm if the PS4 Pro Options are 1080p at (fixed / stable) 60 FPS & 4K (Full or dynamic?) at 30FPS (variable) please?@johncalmc There are a handful of armour sets in the game that provide specific perks. Fortunately, all of them look very cool. The armour is also just one full piece — you don't have to mix and match to get the bonuses. This ain't no RPG, son.You can wear any hat and mask with any armour, too. And all of the headwear is cosmetic only. So go nuts.@sikthvash I don't have an exact analysis, but based on my 70+ hours with the game, the two Pro modes are...Hope that helps!You know you have a hit when you have sites like CNET, Endgadget, IGN, The Hollywood Reporter, and Ars Technica heaping praise on the game (even calling it GOTY). Well done Sucker Punch! This just became a Day One!@ShogunRok Sweet. I mean, if needs be, I will make a game harder for myself by picking rubbish armour just because it looks cool, but I'd rather not have to do that. Quite excited for this.@stuzster You'll be happy to know that there is an option to turn off the blood in the display menu. As far as I know, cutscenes will still show gore, but there'll be no big blood spurts during regular gameplay.@ShogunRok Good non-spoiler review. Also thanks for answering all of the questions. Looking forward to getting this game at some point, but may wait for PS5 and a 4k TV. My current TV is 10 years old, can't be long now. Oh, and I still need to play TW3, should probably do that first. 😁'It's a welcome and refreshing change of pace from the many action RPGs that would have you chip away at your foes for minutes at a time.'Exactly what I thought when watching ACV guy take forever to kill a dam dog...Ok I keep reading.@Spoonman-2 While it certainly warrants respect, I honestly think it just speaks to the increased accessibility to platinums in recent first party games. And while getting them in Spider-Man, HZD, and Days Gone was enjoyable, if quick, it's a little dissonant seeing the 'One Percenter' trophy at 5.6% rarity.🤣Seems like a great game but I don’t want to pay 60 knowing that it’s gonna drop to 20 like they always do, but I’ll get it when that happensVery nice, well written review. I enjoyed it. Cheers.@playstation1995 Nintendo fanboys only ***** on Nintendo.Gamespot gave the game 7/10 because You can't cut down bamboo trees, which is just an utter travesty.this is ridiculous and sony should stop giving free giving free copies to websites. the people who pre-order the game is much worthy to play the game before review websites.Metacritic has a feature for the top games of 2020. In the list are MLB The Show 20, Nioh 2, Final Fantasy VII Remake, Dreams, The Last of Us 2, and Persona 5 Royal. Sitting at an 84 with over 86 reviews, GoT will be safely added to that list. So see...2020 hasn't been all bad.@ShogunRok I think any kind of sequel will probably head to mainland Japan or possibly Mongolia.@ShogunRok Would you say that it's combat is similar to Dark Souls?Sounds like a very well made game which should prove to be a lot of fun, in particular to current fans of open world games.I'll definitely be picking this one up at some point. To everyone getting stuck in from this Friday, I say enjoy!@ShogunRok how is the NPC character building? From what ive seen so far it, the world appears a pretty loanly place for Jin (not a bad thing) but are there cut scenes fleshing out NPC and giving them a little life and back story like in Nioh2 etc? Great review btw. I tried not to read it but, ya know 🤷‍♂️😂Can't wait for Friday. Seems like Sucker Punch's best game since the original inFamous, which is still my favorite of that series. Great way to close things for the big PS4 exclusive content. FF VII, TLoU 2 and this all delivered in their own ways.@AdamNovice I would love Sucker Punch to make a sequel set in the later eras of feudal Japan. Wars between clans and all that kind of stuff. There's a lot they could do with this for sure.Would like this game but can’t afford it this week. Ah well!@Draco_V_Ecliptic It's closer to old Assassin's Creed games, but you have much more freedom than they did. It's honestly quite a unique combat system — it feels like halfway between Assassin's Creed and a more action-based game like God of War or maybe even Dark Souls or Sekiro depending on the enemy that you're fighting.@Kidfunkadelic83 Yeah, it really is quite a lonely game. There aren't many big settlements because everyone's on the run from the Mongols, who control most of the island. But the characters who you do meet are all nicely fleshed out.All of the main characters each have their own series of side quests that tell you all about them. By the end, I was invested in all of Jin's allies.@Boucho11 The game looks lame. Learn how to take less-than-positive PlayStation opinions without wetting your pants, k?My body is ready@Akurusu I’m not wetting my pants. You’re being a tool. Your comment is irrelevant to the article.@Boucho11 Actually it does. I said this game doesn’t look like it’s worth playing. Sorry for not bootlicking.Super duper hyped!!@80sGamer nah...@ShogunRok very tasty review. Really looking forward to playing. (preordered recently)Is there some content which has an embargo on it? I feel like Sony is trying to surprise player in almost all its last exclusives (Abby in TLOU2, classic swords in God of war). Should we expect some twisting surprises here?I know reviews are subjective but this is black and white different to another review i just read about the game. I think i will wait till its half price@HellOfaHunter I dunno. It's fair criticism I think. They want a game grounded in reality. They give you a razor sharp sword. But you can't cut the bamboo (or the grass!). Even though you always see them cutting bamboo and sticks in the movies with katanas. Zelda games always had grass cutting, and it is quite addicting lol. No but seriously, for a game that wants to mimic realism, it's weirdly restricted. And this isn't a criticism of this game alone. Many games feel this way. Interactivity with the environment really helps it all feel more coherent and alive, instead of it being just another static backdrop.I really hope next gen focuses more on interactivity. I rather have that than 4K of 60fps. It's the thing Breath of the Wild did right I think. And I don't have many positive things to say about that game.@Blacksmith1985 Without spoiling anything I wouldn't go in expecting any massive twists, but there is quite a lot of cool stuff that people aren't allowed to show yet.As always, the only review I care about <3I want to play this in Japanese so badly, but why do you think it feels a bit off? To me english would simply ruin the experience I think...@AFCC I think the lip syncing is only done for English, so the Japanese doesn't quite match up sometimes. It's still fine overall though.But honestly, the English voice track really is very good. Don't let it put you off!@Octane can you cut the grass? Lol you’ve been playing too much Zelda! 😂(now all I want is cuttable grass 🤦‍♂️)@ShogunRok Excellent review and seeing as I chose this game over The Last Of Us 2 I'm excited to see such a great score!You mentioned in your review it took you thirty hours to complete the game,was that finishing all the side quests and extras etc?Also,seeing as there is no minimap,is the world map (if there is one) unshaded as you go or are you expected to just come across events or collectables by chance?@Wazeddie22 It's about 25-30 hours to complete the main story and uncover most of the map. It took me around 50 hours to finish every quest and visit every location. It took me over 60 hours to do absolutely everything. So it'll last you a long time if you want to complete the game 100%.There is a map screen that shows the whole map, but areas you haven't visited will be covered by fog. You do get markers for quests and points of interest that are nearby, but apart from that, you simply follow the wind.There are also little birds to follow that'll lead you to secrets, and the world does a great job of leading you places through visuals alone. It's really well designed in that sense.Huh... Must really suck if this got a 9 and last of us part 2 a ten...@ShogunRok Excellent,thanks for the answers,it sounds quite different to the usual open world games then.60 hours to do everything?That's great news cuz that means it will take me at least 80!Going to make this one last that's for sure.I can't wait to pick up my copy and start playing. I've watched a few reviews online and they all say that the best parts of the game outweigh the bad parts. I only wish that those of us who pre-ordered it could start playing it today.Fantastic. Not long to go now. @Akurusu what exactly is your point? This is a new IPCan someone please make a ninja scroll game for heaven sake 👍 oh yeah and fight night💪Happy to hear this delivered!I get open world burnout and some of the the criticism of open world games, but some of the comments here / elsewhere make it seem like some people expect every new open world game to ""reinvent the wheel"" so to speak, and that games are somehow a let down if they are unable to accomplish that.Everyone is entitled to their opinion of course since this is at its most basic level a form of art and entertainment (and tastes will obviously vary in that regard), but that doesn't make it seem like any less of an unrealistic expectation to me.And as for the reviewers calling it samurai Assassin's Creed or hinting at their belief SP is somehow trying to copy those games, that seems awfully rich given that AC has more or less turned into The Witcher 3 copy/pasted into real world historical settings with characters and stories that are not near as interesting (which isn't to say I didn't enjoy parts of Origins and Odyssey, but you get my point).Glad sucker punch nailed it. Made me think of United Front games and how they absolutely nailed Hong Kong in Sleeping Dogs.This really has nothing to do with Ghost of tsushima but I am very tired of the same open world formula devs love to borrow so much from ubisoft games , especially Assassin Creed . Almost every new open world game that comes out is a checklist of the same old boring side quest , collectables and towers you climb to unlock more of the map .I am glad people are so excited for this game, but its not for me.@ShogunRok I'll do it in a second playthrough. I think Japanese really fits this game a lot, so I'll go with that. We just needed some anime voices x)Might be a dumb question on my part ,but here goes. I s it possible to do the stealth missions ignoring that they are stealth,and go in all guns blazing and just hack and slash away?@hulkie i think the stealtb mission are instant fails if spotted buddy.@tameshiyaku now sleeping dogs is one game that deserves a sequel. The game was way better than gta5s story mode imoThank you Push Square - very excited to play the game. Its been a very rough few months and LOU2 almost sent me over the edge, will be wonderful to play something beautiful/ relaxing and challenging@hulkie Some main story missions (and a couple of side quests) force you to be stealthy otherwise it's a game over. But there aren't many of these.For everything else in the game, you can ignore stealth entirely if you want.Had no interest prior. Watched some footage, now I'm intrigued. Being able to ignore stealth sounds just like my cup of bullmilk! @ShogunRok frame rate mode is only 30fps??? That doesnt seem right. If thats high fps mode id hate to see it running in normal mode! Yikes.@Gmork___ Frame rate mode keeps it locked at 30 no matter what. Resolution mode sees some dips but the visuals are much more crisp. I do really hope that the inevitable PS5 upgrade adds a 60fps option, though.I for one am really excited for this game have been since the announcement of it people have been canceling there preorders left and right because of some YouTube review I for one don’t trust YouTube reviews for anything I’ll stick with the gaming industry reviews thanks for the great review@Arnna his point is that he is trying to fly in the face of tradition whilst looking edgy and non conformist...all he is doing is showing anyone who reads his post is how immature he really is.This inconsistency in points given kills me: Death Stranding is a 10. This one, one of the best open worlds in ps4 ever, it's a 9.. (yes, that 10 in 10 of death stranding will never be forgotten. Muahaha. jk) Ok, to be fair, since the moment i saw the first trailer i knew i needed this game. I was hopping that Nioh was it, a really good samurai game (it's not bad but..), but the monsters and stuff was not what i wanted. Tomorrow I'll finally get it.Nice review, btw. I understand what some people say about the comparisons you made, but for me it's quite helpful since i can make a direct comparison with what I experienced in the other games. Good workGreat review guys. Awesome review scores it’s getting. I’ll get this once PS5 is out. I mean it looks stunning on PS4/Pro as it is, but on PS5? Wow that’ll be mesmerising.@Star-Lord You can. You get armour that's dedicated to more stealthy ninja playstyles later on.@Star-Lord It's close! It's between Ghost of Tsushima and Persona 5 Royal. Hopefully Cyberpunk 2077 lives up to expectations as well!Low standards much?Lmao no.. just no.. stop it@Octane I would like to see more games in the future have that sense of realism as well. After playing TLOU2 with it’s full on realism and crazy detailed physics, I would like to see more games move in this direction. It’s not a dealbreaker, by any means, but if the technology can offer it up, why not? 8/10 is maximum for this game.
AI is stupid, only hit high damages.
Story is drama in some parts, and they are unnecessary.
Anyway, still better alot than the last of us 2Brilliant game, i'm totally in love with this game. Nothing new but a perfect mix of all the best what keeps me playing. It drives me to discover everything Great review Robert you really catch the essence and overall feel of this game while outlining the more annoying downsides at the same time. One aspect that took me by a pleasant surprise was the wind directing you to your next location instead of a mediocre line or marker it really adds to the overall atmosphere and is a peaceful alternative. One part of this game which did annoy me at times was the combat system at first glance it looks advance but it is not you use ¼ stances again specific styles and that’s it, I played the game of the hardest difficulty all the way through and overall it was either one shot them or get one shot if I wasn’t in stealth. Boss battles were also aggravating as even with damage reducing and HP increasing armour, I would still get one shot by unlockable and undodgeable instant attacks. Although what really made this game for me was the captivating scenery from the vivid range of colours presented by the cherry blossoms to the vast open fields of flowers and captivating sunsets which can be seen from the top of the mountains. The only other game to come close to the beauty and fun of Ghost of Tsushima is The Witcher 3 for me.

Ghost of Tsushima,John-Paul Jones,PlayStation Universe,https://www.psu.com/reviews/ghost-of-tsushima-ps4-review/," John-Paul Jones / July 14, 2020Ghost Of Tsushima PS4 Review – Look, you need to know that the combat in Ghost of Tsushima is absolutely stunning and fulfilling in ways that other developers just haven’t been able to quite master. It’s simply brilliantly empowering stuff that makes you feel like a Samurai and yet, beyond such seemingly surface fulfillment and being a reliable metric for any action adventure romp worth its salt, it serves Sucker Punch Productions‘ deeper ambition to fashion the sort of relatively po-faced, fantasy-free video game take on Samurai cinema that has been sorely missing for a while now.As a sprawling adventure that brazenly wears its Samurai cinema inspirations on its digital sleeve, Ghost of Tsushima succeeds grandly both as an ode to the classic movies and also as a compelling, character driven odyssey on its own terms. As Jin Sakai, the young heir to the well-respected Sakai clan of Samurai, players must cut a vengeful bloody swathe across the island of Tsushima as Jin seeks to repel the Mongol invaders, avenge his murdered family and restore honor to his clan. It’s the sort of classic yarn that fans of Akira Kurosawa and his legendary lead actor, Toshiro Mifune, will warmly recognize and embrace.Arguably nowhere is this commitment to getting the aesthetic and feel of Samurai cinema right better epitomised than in the Kurosawa Mode. Officially signed off and endorsed by the Kurosawa estate, Kurosawa Mode not only decks out the game in a monochrome filter and ramps up the wind and ambient natural effects (honestly, you’ve never seen so many falling petals in your life), but it also strives to emulate many of the more nuanced filmmaking techniques that the legendary Japanese auteur employed during his heyday too, such as a curved lens, reduced FOV and more.Once into the game proper and akin to a Samurai reflecting upon the rigours of his life through an elegant Haiku poem, it’s certainly fair to say that Ghost of Tsushima demands your patience, at least initially. Split into three acts which correspond to a portion of Tsushima Island turn, Sucker Punch’s latest certainly takes a little while to get going and in its first act, struggles to distance itself from the distinctly shopworn open-world template that Ubisoft has so reliably recycled over the years.Related Content – Best PS4 Exclusives – Amazing Games That Everyone Should PlayThere’s no getting away from it – Ghost of Tsushima is very much a contemporary open world adventure and with it, carries a lot of the design baggage that have served to inflict a kind of fatigue upon those in which the novelty of venturing from point to point and indulging in the same gameplay loop has since worn thin. As a direct result, though Ghost of Tsushima does employ some wrinkles to distinguish itself from seemingly similar offerings, how you feel about it will ultimately depend on how much you love Samurai cinema and whether or not that will be enough to mitigate being saturated with open world games as we currently know them.As such, you can expect to run a broadly similar and familiar gamut of activities that you might see anywhere else, such as clearing out enemy outposts, collecting craftable ingredients, reaching hard to reach areas for precious loot, attacking roaming foes and more besides. That said and as mentioned previously, Ghost of Tsushima does have a few tricks up its patterned sleeve to freshen the formula up a little. The first and most widely known of these is the Guiding Wind mechanic, which pushes the player towards known objectives or, if no objective has been specified, another point of interest that might be close by.Another neat bit of design that Sucker Punch have wrought here is the manner in which they deal with the game world map. A world away from Assassin’s Creed Odyssey’s clutter-orgy of icons, Ghost of Tsushima instead employs a fog of war style approach with its map, where new areas, locations and activities only appear as you physically make your way into that area. In practice, this makes the idea of tackling the game’s wealth of side quests, activities and collectibles far less intimidating than it otherwise would be, whilst also encouraging freeform exploration. Other developers thinking of designing open world experiences of this ilk should take notice.In terms of those activities which are dotted around each of the three maps, Ghost of Tsushima largely does a good job of incentivising the player to spend the time necessary to find and complete them. Hot springs provide Jin with a boost to his maximum health, while bamboo stacks allow our hero to top up his Resolve (more on this in a bit), which aids his success during combat. Elsewhere, though the numerous shrines in Tsushima provide handy charms to buff Jin’s abilities, it’s really in the Tomb Raider esque platforming style challenges that these side activities prove to be the most compelling.Of course, this being a game about Samurai and Mongols and many, many sharp swords, there’s a whole heap of combat in Ghost of Tsushima and happily, I can report that it is among the best I have ever experienced. Indeed, what’s surprising about Ghost of Tsushima’s combat is just how layered it all is.Tapping directly into the veins of classic Samurai action, players are given an option to confront their enemies head-on with a ‘stand-off’, where like a gunslinger tickling the hilt of his gun in anticipation of a quick draw, Jin lightly holds onto the handle of his sword in preparation to deal with an on-rushing foe. By releasing the triangle button at just the right time, Jin can get an instant kill and by placing the appropriate points in the right skill tree, he can extend that streak further still to multiple enemies, often laying waste to a small group of bad dudes in seconds.Despite how shallow the standoff mechanic seems, there is a fair chunk of a nuance to it too. While less hardy foes will blindly rush you and be cut down like swaying corn stalks, more competent adversaries will not only be much faster in attacking you, but they’ll feint too in an attempt to get you to draw prematurely, causing you to lose massive amounts of health in the process.When you nail a perfect standoff and vanquish multiple foes with a single strike each, the feeling of satisfaction is absolutely incredible and more than that, winning at a standoff also sets you up well for the conflict ahead as it is fully restocks your resolve, too. Honestly, it’s the sort of stuff that after watching the likes of Seven Samurai, Yojimbo and Mifune’s Miyamoto Musashi Samurai Trilogy, I thought we would never see realized in a video game in this sort of fidelity, and yet here we are. Sucker Punch Productions are in fact magicians, it would seem.Once the fight kicks off properly, it isn’t long before you settle into the flow of Ghost of Tsushima’s moment to moment combat. In a fashion not dissimilar to FROM Software’s Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, there is a premium placed on parrying, with a perfectly counterattack at the correct time dealing an unholy amount of hurt to your enemies that often results in an instant kill.There’s a trick to this though. While regular attacks can be countered, some enemies will attempt to strike Jin with highly damaging attacks in which the window for a counter is extremely small, as evidenced by a silver-blue glint coming off their weapons. Equally, many enemies have unblockable attacks too, requiring Jin to do an evasive roll or backwards hop in order to avoid serious damage and it’s in the later enemies which mix up all of these attacks that the player is presented with a true challenge.Another design element that Ghost of Tsushima shares with Sekiro is the stagger mechanic. Here, if Jin pressures a foe sufficiently with a steady stream of attacks, he can break through their guard and start doing real damage to them. Where things get a little more complicated though is in the multiple stances that Jin can use, since each enemy can only really be properly staggered if you’re in the correct stance. It takes some getting used to for sure, but in the heat combat switching between each of the four stances mid-flow can be super satisfying also.In keeping with its dyed in the wool Samurai cinema stylings, Ghost of Tsushima leans into the romanticism of the genre with its highly intense duel scenarios. Subtle, spectacle stuffed encounters where players must overcome a singular and extremely challenging foe, these duels unfold against the often idyllic backdrop of a shower of blossoms, against a waterfall and just about every other classic Samurai duel setting you can think of.As much as Jin wants to be an honorable Samurai and a credit to his clan, he soon realizes that in order to defeat the Mongol hordes who abide by no such code, he must try and win by any way he can – regardless of how it affects his code of honor (more on that later). In practice, this results in Jin being able to employ a number of tricks and gadgets during battle in addition to his trusty katana.From using bows, quickly flung kunai, black powder bombs and much more, Ghost of Tsushima presents players with a surprising number of creative ways to end the fight – though such tricks are not available in the otherwise honorable duels, for obvious reasons. Beyond such tools and shortcuts and by completing the corresponding side quests, Jin can also learn a series of ‘mythic techniques’ that are super devastating unblockable attacks, but the use of each one consumes his resolve and it’s here that Ghost of Tsushima reveals another layer of its sophisticated combat system.Resolve is essentially a finite resource that can be used to heal Jin or to use the aforementioned mythic techniques, but in doing so, the player must consider how best to use it during a fight; creating a neat risk/reward dynamic in the process. To replenish his resolve, Jin can successfully complete a standoff, defeat foes in combat or assassinate enemies – and it’s that last point which brings us to the polar opposite of Ghost of Tsushima’s confrontational combat mechanics.Brilliantly, you can avoid direct confrontation altogether and go full ninja if you want; silently stalking the Mongol horde from the rooftops before dropping down upon them with an airborne assassination, or carving your way through a group of them with a chain assassination technique. Certainly, when you’re sprinting across rooftops, crawling under huts, silently killing enemies with blowpipes and generally being something of an horrific ninja bastard, Ghost of Tsushima starts to feel like the Tenchu remake that we never got.At the core of Ghost of Tsushima’s narrative is the notion that honor is paramount and that no matter how bad the Mongol forces are (spoiler – they’re very, very bad), a Samurai should never give up that code regardless of the adversity standing before him. Instead, a Samurai should face every enemy head-on and not stoop to using subterfuge or any other kind of clandestine approach in order to win the day and it’s that very same system that Mongols turn against the Japanese; exploiting their unwillingness to do what is necessary in order win.Jin, who studied the Samurai code extensively under the rigidly traditional Lord Shimura, who not only doubles up as his uncle but also as the former ruler of Tsushima, finds himself at odds with his upbringing, the man he wants to be and everything he must do in order to ensure the survival of his people. And it’s here, in that thunderous conflict between tradition and necessity that Ghost of Tsushima forms a ruthlessly efficient storytelling hook, as Jin must turn his back on everything he’s ever known in a heart-wrenching attempt to break the back of the Mongol invasion.Beyond its central theme, the cast of characters in Ghost of Tsushima are a largely stoic and stuffy lot – though that’s to be expected. From honourable Samurai, to roguish thieves, coarse ronin and even half dunk/half insane sake merchants, it’s certainly fair to say that Ghost of Tsushima gleefully plumbs the depths of Samurai cinema character archetypes. Though again, this serves to dovetail nicely into Sucker Punch’s ambition to create a video game ode to the Samurai cinema classics of yesteryear – and it’s an ambition that the Washington based studio pulls off with commendable verve and aplomb.Indeed Jin himself feels like an amalgam of classic Samurai cinema heroes, at once coming across with all the fire of Mifune’s Sanjuro, while at the same time extolling the humble stoutness of Hiroyuki Sanada’s Twilight Samurai. He’s an eminently likeable sort who strives to do the right thing but finds himself in conflict with his traditions and beliefs at every turn – fashioning him into quite the unexpectedly compelling protagonist in the process. Something else that should be keenly noted is just how refreshing it is to have a Samurai game that plays it straight and avoids letting fantasy elements bleed into either its design or story. More of this please.Ghost of Tsushima is also a fantastically and handsomely made effort too. Though it follows so soon after the stellar technical showcase of The Last of Us Part 2, comparisons with Naughty Dog’s latest are perhaps unavoidable but are also deeply unfair as the two PS4 exclusives each have very different visual design goals. For a start, Ghost of Tsushima renders a massive open world and it does so in slavish service to the Samurai cinema setting that Sucker Punch strives so very hard to emulate.And what a beautiful world it is too. There is a scene early on where two Samurai face off in a makeshift arena as red maple leaves gently shower and scatter everywhere according to the frenzied footwork of the combatants, while the superb lighting and shadowing work that Sucker Punch have done with the game make practically every second a photo capture worthy moment. Whether it’s Jin galloping on his horse through a swaying sea of pampas grass, or quietly writing a haiku while the sun slowly sets, bathing the world in a gold-copper glow, Ghost of Tsushima excels at creating these sorts of natural showcases like no other title out there.On the flipside, the character models don’t quite equal the jaw-dropping world that they exist in. While Jin and other major characters are detailed nicely enough, less important characters are not. Another slightly disappointing blemish to Ghost of Tsushima’s visual presentation is that the lip syncing is engineered around the English dub, rather than Japanese audio, which if you’re playing the game in the other wise super authentic Kurosawa mode, is a touch disappointing as it detracts a touch from the overall keenly felt sensation of authenticity.At well over 50 hours long and depending on the depth of your open-world fatigue, so too will your opinion of Ghost of Tsushima similarly oscillate. Ably mitigated by my own boundless affection for Samurai movies and the riffs on the iconic auteurship of Kurosawa and his genre contemporaries, I was able to quite happily look past the more shopworn aspects of Ghost of Tsushima’s open world design DNA simply on account of just how thoroughly Sucker Punch have managed to nail the look, sound and feel of the setting.With the combat being truly best in class stuff too, in addition to the surprisingly compelling story and cast of characters, there is a lot to love about Ghost of Tsushima, but ultimately your mileage will vary on your saturation of the open world design that is threaded through every aspect of its creation. For me though? Ghost of Tsushima is the fantasy-free, Samurai Tenchu hybrid with the sort of absolutely heart-stopping, fist-pumping ending that I’ve been waiting so long for. Here’s hoping that this is the last time we see this sort of standard open world template though, because as Jin himself soon discovers, often it’s best to just move on and evolve.Ghost of Tsushima releases exclusively on PlayStation 4 on July 17, 2020.Review code kindly provided by SIE.Ghost of Tsushima elevates the existing open world adventure template with a fantasy-free Samurai adventure that deftly pays loving homage to the Samurai cinema of old. While your mileage may vary according to your level of open world fatigue, Ghost of Tsushima undoubtedly remains not only one of the best open world romps money can buy and a stunning PlayStation 4 exclusive, but also Sucker Punch Productions finest effort to date.

Ghost of Tsushima,Christopher Byrd,Washington Post,https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/reviews/ghost-tsushima-striking-samurai-fantasy/,"This article was published more than 2 years agoGhost of TsushimaDeveloped by: Sucker PunchPublished by: Sony Interactive EntertainmentAvailable on: PlayStation 4Though “Ghost of Tsushima’s” charismatic characters and intricate combat are a significant draw, what first kindled my admiration for the new open-world RPG set in 13th-century Japan is its respect for poetry. Early in the game, Jin Sakai, the samurai hero of the story, encounters an old man sitting on a rock who advises him to take up the art of haiku. The anonymous poet makes a practical case for its utility, telling Jin that haiku can help a warrior clear his mind of internal strife and find equanimity.Curious to take him up on this advice, I led Jin to a nearby overlook — with a view of the forest in the distance — where he sat down. Using the right thumbstick of the controller to pan the camera back and forth, I was able to focus Jin’s attention on specific parts of the landscape by pressing the X button, and compose a haiku: “Whispers through the trees/Protected from the harsh sun/A sturdy defense.” In all my years of gaming, this was the first time I helped the protagonist in an action game reflect on the theme of serenity.“Ghost of Tsushima” is a game that abounds with such nifty elements. Rather than depend on an unsightly compass, or a mini-map, on the screen for navigation (as is typical for most large-scale open world games), you can swipe your finger across the touch pad to rustle up a breeze — the Guiding Wind — to point you in the right direction. In fact, you can discover points of interest in the world without consulting a map at all. From time to time a golden-colored bird or a fox will cross your path. Following them will lead you to convenient locations such as shrines or hot springs where Jin can pray or bathe to increase his stats. Details like these help connect the player to the world in a way that feels more or less organic, and I expect other developers will crib some of these innovative features.Though it is often said of the best open-world games that the environment is like a character itself, the cliche is borne out in “Ghost of Tsushima.” Set during the time of the Mongol invasion of Japan, this visually stunning samurai epic tells the story of Jin’s quest to repel the invaders who, at the start of his journey, wipe out most of his fellow samurai and capture his uncle, Lord Shimura, the leader of the region. For much of the first act of the campaign, Jin focuses on raising an army to help him free his uncle. Along the way, he encounters Yuna, a no-nonsense thief. Over time, she comes to exert great influence on his life. She counsels him that to defeat the Mongols, he will have to put aside some of his samurai ideals, such as always confronting enemies head-on rather than taking “the coward’s way'' and sneaking up on them from behind. She also seeds an idea among the peasants that Jin is a ghost or an avenging spirit whose destiny will lead the haggard population to victory.I enjoyed watching Jin grapple with the need to loosen his own moral framework. The story skillfully cuts back to scenes from his youth where his uncle instilled in him the value of the samurai code. All of the main characters I’ve encountered so far have interesting backstories that show how the circumstances of their lives shaped their perceptions of the world. This is an easy heroic fantasy to fall into if one has a weakness for samurai tales.As Jin makes his way across the island, he meets all manner of foes, including dual-wielding swordsmen and wrathful spirits. There is a fairly deep combat system to learn, but this is balanced by generous quality-of-life features. For example, you can adjust the difficulty at any time, even midway through a boss fight.By defeating a set number of Mongol leaders, Jin can increase his repertoire of sword poses. Each of the four stances — Sun, Wind, Water and Moon — are useful in particular situations. Water stance, for instance, is effective against shield-bearing foes while Wind stance is good for handling pikemen. Switching between stances requires one to hold down the right trigger and press one of the face buttons on the controller. Doing so slows down time so there is rarely cause to panic even when juggling different types of foes. (It’s worth mentioning that on a number of occasions, I found it relatively easy to exploit the enemy AI, outside boss fights. Crawling beneath an elevated house, for example, is a good way to lose pursuers.)By defeating enemies, Jin builds up “resolve,” which is represented by small yellow circles in the lower corner of the screen. He can tap into his resolve to heal himself or perform special moves, which can be acquired by tackling the game’s supernatural or Mythic Tales. He can add to his stock of resolve by visiting stations where he can practice his swordsmanship by trying to strike through a row of bamboo branches with a single slash. Doing so requires one to input a chain of button presses in a short amount of time, the catch being that once one begins the sequence, the visual prompts vanish from the screen. I found that the easiest way to do this was to close my eyes and use my memory rather than look at the screen; I like it when a game flirts with meditation.“Ghost of Tsushima” is a vast game. I have poured at least a couple dozen hours into it but have much left to see. I suspect it will keep me enjoyably busy until the leaves fall from their trees and the next console cycle begins.Christopher Byrd is a Brooklyn-based writer.

Ghost of Tsushima,Justin Clark,Slant Magazine,https://www.slantmagazine.com/games/review-ghost-of-tsushima-lacks-ambition-but-resounds-with-poetic-verisimilitude/,"The game has the look of a thoughtful samurai epic, but the façade flakes under scrutiny.Despite the game being about as far as you can get from a story set in 13th-century Japan, there’s a quote from Mass Effect 3 that kept echoing in my head throughout the 40-plus hours it took me to complete Ghost of Tsushima: “Stand amongst the ashes of a trillion dead souls, and ask the ghosts if honor matters.” It’s a wonderfully poetic line of dialogue, from a game that’s every bit as concerned with how people fight a righteous war, and how much tradition and legacy and optics play a role in that.Poetry can be wrung from human attempts to justify horrific but necessary actions—it’s just that, aside from the occasional line of dialogue like the aforementioned one, video games as a medium are often lunkheaded when it comes to deploying poetry. Bless Ghost of Tsushima, then, for trying to do so. Sucker Punch’s latest has a rich, painterly beauty that places a premium on silence, and on the way its systems treat swordplay, creating environmental systems that bring awe to even the most mundane scenes. And the game very much explores the relevance of honor in a world that requires the wetwork of bastards. Quite often, Ghost of Tsushima suggests poetry in motion, but it’s still playing in a space that relies too much on imprudence for mass appeal.That foolishness was baked into Ghost of Tsushima right from the conceptual stage, as this is a game about Japanese culture and traditions that doesn’t have a single Japanese person credited as a writer or creative director. It’s a problem somewhat mitigated by how many Asian creatives were still involved in its making, but this is still a game that caters to players who’ve maybe seen Akira Kurosawa’s Seven Samurai and aren’t likely to do a double take while their character composes (largely meaningless) haikus some 400 years before Matsuo Bashō was even born, or being told that a particularly murderous Japanese woman had to teach the Mongols, of all people, how to properly use a bow and arrow. Nonetheless, if you’re willing to extend the good-faith exception to Ghost of Tsushima and judge it not for its historical accuracy, but for its true aim of delivering a lurid, pulpy tale of samurai vengeance set in one of the most strikingly beautiful open worlds ever crafted for a video game, you will find that it’s a ringing, if pointedly unambitious, success.The game is set in 1274, as the Mongols, during their first invasion of Japan, raid their way across the tiny island of Tsushima. Our hero, Jin Sakai, and his uncle, Lord Shimura, are the first to try their hands against the invaders, but led by Khotun Khan, a soft-spoken but hulking, brutal warlord, the Mongols lay waste to the island’s best samurai—save for Lord Shimura, who’s held hostage, and Jin, who’s left for dead on a beach until a thief named Yuna nurses him back to health. Determined to get his uncle back by any means necessary, Jin adopts a few tactics frowned upon by proper samurai warriors, and makes a name for himself across the countryside as the Ghost, defending the weak and striking fear into the hearts of his enemies.You could be forgiven for thinking that sounds more like the stuff of Batman than of the code of Bushido, but it’s difficult to deny that that game makes it feel really good to play as a samurai caped crusader. It’s gratifying to wander beautiful watercolor valleys and approach marauders with steel in the eyes and hands, taking them down with extreme prejudice. And, in general, the combat is exquisitely simple, for basically forcing players to match their sword style with that of their enemies at the push of a button, and for the way the game’s forgiving parry system leads you to harshly punish enemy mistakes. Ghost of Tsushima’s most thoughtful and well-executed element is its Standoff mechanic, where pressing a button within a certain distance invites a group of enemies to send their best warrior for a face-to-face quickdraw, which is quite literally predicated on the visceral release of tension, of letting go of the attack button and opening an enemy’s neck.The game largely follows the open-world action-adventure playbook to the letter, with all the map exploration, base-clearing, and collectible hunting that implies. On its face, that’s disappointing, especially given that Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice was more ambitious on that front. But that’s also a game that breathlessly hinges on survival and has no interest in giving you power and exhilaration. Sekiro is out to kill you, whereas Ghost of Tsushima is literally and figuratively guiding players to follow where the breeze takes them.Across this game, Jin takes up the sword not just for the scattered resistance fighters attempting to force the invaders off their land, but in the name of farmers in search of their dead families, warriors looking to avenge their fallen comrades, dying family members looking to clear the enemy out of their ancestral cemeteries, and just straight-up bloody revenge against a horde of bandits. Alluring little side stories dot your path to the next major objective, and as you’re constrained by the limits of having to travel such long distances by horseback, the game gives you plenty of opportunity to get lost—all the better to let its beautiful and tranquil approach to storytelling wash over you. The basic bones of Ghost of Tsushima are open-world tropes, but they hold up thrilling little dimestore tales that could have been pulled from a collection of Lone Wolf and Cub manga, and those tropes are executed with a deliberate elegance that’s rare in the big-budget game space.It’s frustrating, then, how often the game pulls the reins back on our joy, to remind us that we’re somehow playing the role of a samurai wrong. As much as dissonant ludonarrative guilt usually grinds up against the sheer glee of stabbing an enemy in the back here, it’s especially unfortunate when one of the lovingly rendered assassinations triggers a cutscene with Lord Shimura reminding Jin how he promised never to do that same exact thing. But for what it’s worth, the best elements of the story also seem self-aware of such hypocrisy.For one, the first samurai you ever see on screen attempts to face Khotun Khan face to face, with honor, and the warlord retorts by setting the man on fire. Later, when Jin finds himself playing dirty against Khan’s forces, resulting in an aftermath that would be horrifically grisly if it wasn’t against proven monsters, Jin proudly states that he did what had to be done to crush the enemy. Throughout, you probably won’t regret anything, and the story will, by and large, take your side over strict samurai doctrine. It’s made abundantly clear that this is a fight that requires monsters, and aside from two very story-specific missions, you’re allowed to confront the enemy in whatever way you see fit, with no long-lasting effects on the game world itself.Then again, why even attempt to instill guilt on the player at all if there’s no imperative to change the way you play the game? Even The Last of Us Part II has the sense to use the player’s own bloodlust against them, as a means of underlining how emotionally tiring and spiritually numbing it is. The guilt over becoming the Ghost, and all the grotesquery that implies, is the crux of Ghost of Tsushima’s story, but it’s a non-issue until the game sporadically decides it is one, admonishing us for using stealthy, ninja-like tactics but giving no impetus to want to stop doing so. It’s not until the emotionally complex epilogue that regret means anything for more than a few scant minutes at a time, and plopping the need for regret in the middle of the game’s most magnificent and cathartic moments of savagery comes across half-hearted at best.That’s a byproduct of Ghost of Tsushima not pushing the envelope far enough away from its open-world ancestors. The things that would rush the game toward maturity—a firmer handle on history, a more in-depth exploration of the deeply stratified and elitist samurai caste system, or making Jin’s defiance of his uncle’s teachings a more proactive thing in the player’s hands—are largely left underdeveloped. Instead, like many big-budget prestige games, this one settles for “that primally satisfying violence you’re doing is bad.”That Mass Effect 3 quote is a good summation of Ghost of Tsushima, but there’s a much more poetic one enabled right from the options menu: a visual filter called Kurosawa mode that renders the whole game in grainy black and white. You can even turn on the Japanese language track for an extra hint of verisimilitude, and some particularly strong performances from the voice cast. But no matter how excellent those performances are, or how much the visuals suggest deleted scenes from Rashomon, it’s hard to ignore that the characters’ lips are in sync with the English dub, and that the subtitles fail to convey what the Japanese actors are saying. Which is to say, Ghost of Tsushima has the look of a thoughtful samurai epic, but the façade flakes under scrutiny, revealing that it serves Western blockbuster tastes and tenets above all. It’s a game that so desperately wants to be 13 Assassins but more times than not ends up looking like The Last Samurai.Sony Interactive Entertainment did not respond to our request for review code.

Ghost of Tsushima,Billy Givens,We Got This Covered,https://wegotthiscovered.com/gaming/ghost-of-tsushima-review/,"  Few games manage to meet the wild expectations set by the hype train that precedes them, often leaving players feeling underwhelmed when they finally get their hands on a new title and find that it’s essentially the same thing they’ve played so many times before. I tend to assume the latter, instead, so when a truly special game comes along, I can be unexpectedly swept off my feet and treated to a mind-blowing journey. And that’s exactly what Ghost of Tsushima has achieved by masterfully melding every facet of its gameplay, story, and visuals into a gorgeous, gripping adventure unlike anything I’ve ever played. It has not only exceeded my expectations for what AAA games should be – it has redefined them altogether.Ghost of Tsushima centers around samurai Jin Sakai during the first Mongol invasion of Japan. When the majority of his clan is killed during the initial attack, Jin is forced to regroup with scattered survivors and build a new army to fight back and save their home of Tsushima Island. And while there is a wider story of war and widespread destruction, this is largely a personal tale of Jin grappling with survivor guilt, familial insecurity, and the realization that saving his people may come at the cost of his core principles. It’s easily among modern gaming’s most compelling narratives, and it’s made even better thanks to stellar writing and voice acting, which includes options for English or Japanese languages.Whereas a game like Assassin’s Creed often loses me early on with a seemingly endless number of faces, names, and locations to memorize in order to understand its larger plot, Ghost of Tsushima is easy enough to follow, despite introducing dozens of meaningful supporting characters from various clans and ways of life. This is mostly because the story doesn’t burden you with history lessons woven into needlessly lengthy conversations. You learn what you need to know through simple, realistic dialogue from memorable and relatable characters who aren’t there to bog you down in hours of exposition.Instead, that exposition is sewn into the fabric of the experience during every moment of gameplay. We personally witness the outcome of the Mongol invasion through homes turned to ash, displaced survivors in scattered camps, beaches littered with dead bodies, and invading ships sailing the open waters on the horizon. Tsushima Island is a ravaged place, and we’re forced to endure and survive while we assist those left standing alongside us.And yet despite all of the chaos and destruction, the island may be the single most beautiful locale in any game I’ve ever played. The attention to detail is staggering, and I found myself consistently overwhelmed by the way thousands of vibrant leaves ride the wind, or how a sunset casts just the perfect light on dense, wide-stretching fields of pampas grass, which sway realistically in the breeze on a stormy afternoon. It’s an unrivaled masterpiece in visual artistry that has to be seen to be believed, and I’m blown away by developer Sucker Punch’s ability to bring this world to life with so much exquisite detail.I’m thankful that the game has made the most of such a stunning world by almost completely doing away with a HUD outside of combat, giving you the opportunity to remain fully immersed in the island’s breathtaking eye candy. The choice to eschew a mini-map and traditional waypoint system altogether allows navigation to feel more pure, calling upon the player to look to nature to guide your way. Golden birds fly by tempting you to follow them to secrets, smoke in the distance gives clues as to where encampments might be, and gusts of wind subtly guide you in the direction of your selected objectives. Such contextual navigation is so captivating that going back to old-fashioned open-world mini-maps in other games is going to be a drag.This dedication to making everything feel organic and cohesive reaches to the game’s story and quest structure, too. Optional missions are usually relatively quick, self-contained stories, and they only occasionally amount to a simple enemy encounter or fetch quest. They’re typically thoughtful, intimate tales of love, loss, and moral ambiguity that have Jin directly connecting to his people through his service, and they act as important world-building tools that reveal the devastating effects that the Mongol invasion has had on the residents of Tsushima Island.Ghost of Tsushima uses the remainder of its exploration, resource collection, and upgrading to further create a sense of time and place by expanding on the authenticity of Japanese and samurai culture. Jin’s multitude of historically accurate armor sets and weapons visibly improve upon upgrading, lending a sense of credibility to their newly acquired extra defense or damage capabilities. Even something as basic as leveling up your resolve – a resource that builds during combat and allows you to heal or perform special abilities – requires you to visit special places, stack bamboo shafts, and slice through them just as samurai did while training so many years ago.You can stop at peaceful spots like river banks and hilltops to reflect and craft haikus that provide you with headbands to wear, or you can climb treacherous mountain cliffs to find shrines which grant you charms to augment your abilities. Maybe you’ll be greeted by one of the game’s many adorable foxes, and follow it to a statue that you can pray at to earn additional slots to place those charms, or a bird will lead you to a hot spring that raises your maximum health. The game respects your time all the while, having none of these smaller events take more than a few minutes to complete so that you can get on with more pressing matters – like bloodshed.Years of training in the ways of samurai has taught Jin to fight with a code of honor, but with limited resources and people, he’s faced with the realization that he either has to learn to fight dirty or die at the hands of the invading army. Early on in the game, an otherwise unwinnable scenario forces you to learn the ways of stealth and assassination. It serves to complicate Jin’s lifelong internal struggle with his own mixed emotions toward samurai ideals, but in terms of gameplay, it grants you access to a sizable suite of new tools and options with which to take on your foes should you wish to stick to the shadows.Luckily, Ghost of Tsushima is pretty liberal with how you handle objectives. With the exception of a few forced stealth sections, encounters throughout the game are littered with opportunities for you to tackle them however you see fit. You can waltz in and engage a hoard of Mongols head-on like the badass samurai you’ve always been, or you can slink around slitting throats and shooting arrows from afar like the ghost you’ve learned to embrace. You can even combine elements of both by using your katana along with tools like smoke bombs and throwable kunai to get the upper hand in large crowds.While I found a healthy balance between the two gameplay styles, I definitely enjoyed active fighting a good deal more due to the utter thrill of parrying, dodging, and visceral katana slices. The combat feels like an entrancing dance as you weave together light and heavy attacks that result in sprays of blood and gurgling victims, all while Jin remains precisely as calm and calculated as you’d expect a samurai to be. It’s both visually and tangibly mesmerizing, and I never grew tired of the gory spectacle.Four quickly swappable stances — you’ll unlock these one-by-one as you progress through the game — give you an advantage against different types of enemies. As you get more comfortable with the controls, it becomes a breeze to switch to a water stance to give you the leg up against shielded Mongols or take on a stone stance so you can better handle a swordsman. Considering the large variety of enemy variations, switching between stances becomes more and more imperative as the game wears on, leaving you with little choice but to adapt or suffer the consequences.That said, Ghost of Tsushima isn’t a prohibitively difficult game on its normal difficulty, but combat still requires patience, knowledge of your foes, and mastery of your expansive kit. You’d be forgiven for initially feeling overwhelmed by the sheer number of different attacks, upgrades, and tools at your disposal, but they’re doled out slowly as your journey unfolds so that you have time to learn one thing before another is provided to you. It’s worth praising, too, how the developers managed to fit such an extraordinary amount of actions on a controller with limited buttons while still making them all feel intuitive.I completed the story and every additional goal Ghost of Tsushima has to offer in approximately 40 hours, and I’m still playing it just to take in each and every little detail Sucker Punch has included in its marvelous recreation of Tsushima Island. In a generation filled with exceptional titles, I can’t think of another experience that has been this consistently enrapturing and authentic, managing to be a remarkable achievement in every category in which games are judged. It’s a lovingly-crafted adventure that transcends its medium to be a shining example of video games as art and it’s a hell of a swan song for the PlayStation 4.This review is based on the PlayStation 4 Pro version of the game. A copy was provided by Sony Interactive Entertainment.Ghost of Tsushima is a riveting tale complemented by infinitely fascinating combat, inventive navigation mechanics, and arresting visuals, effortlessly earning itself a spot as one of the absolute best games released on the PlayStation 4."
