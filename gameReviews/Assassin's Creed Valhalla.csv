Assassin's Creed Valhalla,Tom Phillips,Eurogamer,https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-11-04-assassins-creed-valhalla-review,"Worthy of passing to the next generation.There's a Viking belief that the paths we walk are predetermined, and that the threads of our lives are already woven like strands in a collective tapestry. Where your own thread encounters others, even where it ends, are points in history already sewn together by the Fates. But the Vikings also believed in an idea of free will, in the possibility to see the path prophecy might have chosen and the ability to resist it, to fight for your own destiny and the destinies of those whose lives you might touch. Such ideas run through the brilliant narrative of Assassin's Creed Valhalla and the life of its heroine Eivor, to lift this beautiful game into a saga for the ages. A Viking-set Assassin's Creed is a perfect setting for a series which has always been obsessed by the ideas of order versus resistance, of Assassins versus Templars (or again here, in this third chapter set in ancient times, the Hidden Ones versus the Order of the Ancients). It's also a perfect setup for whatever kind of Assassin's Creed game you're looking for - one which involves some wonky sci-fi shenanigans and fun mythological elements or simply a 60-hour Viking tale about knocking English heads together. Valhalla protagonist Eivor is a very likable Viking, a level-headed conqueror suddenly set on a path for England in search of a new home and in support of her clan. There was always going to be a tension between the popular view of Vikings as only raiders and pillagers rather than the settlers they were also - but Eivor's story and search for her own brand of peace smooths away this tension as much as possible. Over the course of her quest around the kingdoms, her task is to unite more than it is to divide - something underpinned by your regular returns to the settlement of Ravensthorpe, a place you'll help grow into a home for a diverse cast of characters. It's not perfect - smashing up monasteries simply to build huts in your hometown and only slaying soldiers, rather than monks, is pure video game logic - but as far as Valhalla's charismatic and wonderfully dry main character is concerned, Eivor does enough to carry the story through. Much has been made of the option to play Eivor as either male or female - a first for the Assassin's Creed series - and in particular of Valhalla's default choice which has the game pick this for you at specific points. With hindsight, knowing the narrative reason for this and seeing its overall impact on the vast, vast percentage of the experience, this option is actually the one I'd recommend - at least until the game swaps who you're playing as for the first time, or it finally clicks for you as to why it does. Suffice to say this option never impacted my attachment to the Eivor I played as across the majority of the game, and it is not the situation some had expected, where your immersion could be broken by a constant ping-pong back and forth. Your version of Eivor - their life, their choices and their relationships - is never detracted from, something that had been a valid concern. This option also has wider - and ultimately, I believe, positive - implications in the struggle to see better female representation in the Assassin's Creed series - something pushed for by Ubisoft's own developers as well as fans, especially in a game that is still overwhelmingly being marketed with its male option front and centre. Eivor's story thread involves a prophecy she will eventually betray Sigurd, her brother and clan leader, something initially as unthinkable to her as the idea their collective glories won't earn them a place side-by-side in Valhalla. Their bond is strong, forged amongst family tragedy and the need to survive in new lands, but slowly the threads binding the siblings begin to fray. There are many hours of story and several key characters that play a part in this, and while it's a tale best left to be unravelled by yourself as much as possible, it's a changing relationship that is well paced. As Eivor, I was the one journeying the land to form alliances and grow our settlement while Sigurd was off messing around with Basim, his new assassin buddy. Whenever Sigurd disappeared off-screen for several hours, I would wonder what he was up to, and when he popped up again, I wouldn't always like what I heard.Eivor's path towards this reckoning is one she walks alongside the mysterious figure of Odin, someone she has a peculiarly close connection with. The Viking god has a prophecy of his own to struggle with: the legend he will meet his maker on the apocalyptic day of Ragnarok, in the jaws of the giant wolf Fenrir. Ubisoft has already shown glimpses of Valhalla's mythological realms, which Eivor can visit via a dream-like connection, and it's in those you will find out much, much more about Odin's role in the story, the parallels between him and Eivor, and the connection between the two. It's smartly-plotted stuff, couched in just the right way so it never feels too out of place, while acting like a mythological story add-on woven directly into the base game. For those who enjoyed the more experimental and varied environments found in Odyssey's excellent Atlantis expansion, Asgard and Jotunheim are built in much the same vein. Finally, it's worth mentioning what's going on outside of the Animus, where there's a quick conclusion to the ongoing story of Layla Hassan, the character you played in the modern day sections of the two previous games, Assassin's Creed Origins and Odyssey. It's 2020, the pandemic is real, and on top of that there's another newly-prophesied threat to stop, similar to the impending solar flare back in the series' Desmond era. As ever, the answers lie back in the past and specifically, in Eivor's story. Can this trio of characters - Eivor, Odin, Layla - unpick the threads of their fates? That is the story Valhalla tells and ultimately answers in a more cohesive way than the splayed story threads of Odyssey's own trio of plotlines (and for those who just want to play the historical stuff, rest assured that remains the overwhelming focus). But while there are similarities to Odyssey in the shape of Valhalla's story, there are some key differences in how it is told. I had expected Valhalla to stick to the formula of Ubisoft Quebec's very popular predecessor, but the Origins team at Ubisoft Montreal has come up with something much closer to its own previous Ancient Egypt-set chapter. Where Odyssey offered branching storytelling and quests with a cascade of narrative outcomes, Valhalla's story is noticeably more linear, with few places to really exert your own decision-making and control. Each of its many map regions holds an arc with several main missions and perhaps a secondary objective, but no side-quests whatsoever. Indeed, in what feels like a regression even from Origins, you'll simply run across fleeting world events, which amount to quick interactions with NPCs. Valhalla's winnowed quest structure feels like a decision made to provide a more focused tale - one that is never left to wander all over the Mediterranean, but that instead directs you to specific parts of England, one at a time, before reporting back to your settlement for a debrief. Each region you visit feels like a feature-length episode of a good TV show, with guest stars that often recur further down the line. The focused plot twists and heartbreaks in Valhalla's tale often hit emotional highs Odyssey sometimes struggled with amongst the sheer weight of storytelling spread all over its world, while Eivor's journeys further afield to Vinland, Asgard and Jotunheim are well integrated into direction of the main narrative rather than being left for players who still want more after the main quest is done. Still, it's a disappointment that the flourishing RPG-side of Assassin's Creed has been impacted, that Valhalla does not hold much room for meaningful choices, and that the few dialogue options on offer give little more than quickly-forgotten flavour. Eivor is a great and memorable heroine, but one I rarely felt I was forging my own version of, as I had with Odyssey's Kassandra.One antidote to the lack of side-quests is the impact of your settlement, and the time you'll spend getting to know its growing community. For those who remember Assassin's Creed 3's frontier village, the vibe is very similar - and, ultimately it feels closer to that than the kind of RPG hub where everyone has something new to say every time you visit. Still, every so often, a new quest will pop up involving one of your villagers, and typically these slice of life stories offer an enjoyable palate cleanser from the drama of the main campaign. You'll go hunting or sightseeing, sometimes to be rewarded with an unexpected new ability or item as a result, or other times just to get closer to a character who might otherwise be a vendor. Some of these characters can be romanced (there are a few options for flings outside the village too), and some can become a permanent partner for Eivor. It's a step up from the fleeting romance options introduced in Odyssey, but it still feels mechanical. And while one particular romance option does impact the game's story - one of the few times I felt able to see something of my own version of Eivor play out - this thread still felt abrupt.Otherwise, your settlement features a bustling population you can mostly ignore, unless you need their services or access to one of the game's various systems they control. There's a blacksmith who can upgrade gear quality, boat workers who can trick out your longship, or hunters who reward you for slaughtering wildlife. Assassin's Creed Origins fans will recognise a familiar face once again providing quests to let you grind out items from the game's paid cosmetic packs. Other characters here have even less to do - the initially interesting Hidden One named Hytham, for example, or Roman fanatic Octavian, both essentially act as places to dump collectables you find when exploring the open world. I love having a settlement with so many familiar faces in it, I just wish there was more for them to do.Beyond the settlement's walls, England awaits. Valhalla's version is the ultimate Saxon pastoral fantasy, one of roundhouse huts and crumbling Roman ruins set amongst flowering meadows, dry stone walls, forests, fens, and fields. Every surface feels embellished, from the fronds of moss on the stones Eivor climbs, to the cave systems regularly hidden behind towering waterfalls. It is often astonishingly pretty, particularly around golden hour, or as the evening mist sets in, moonlight filtering through trees. I could write pages about how this game replicates the feeling of the English countryside, the flourishes that can be found as you explore, the dirt which gets caked onto Eivor's boots as she stomps through the fields, or the snow kicked onto her clothes while adventuring in colder climes. (And, as a local, the sight of an early Norwich, the inclusion of Seahenge, the legendary Black Shuck and the ability to see seals on the north Norfolk coast felt like East Anglian fan service.) Between England, Norway, Vinland, Asgard and Jotunheim, Eivor has an astonishing breadth of landscapes to explore, and while size comparisons are always crude, Valhalla's world is one which altogether feels equal to Odyssey's scope. More importantly, perhaps, it is spread out in a way that feels more manageable, more varied, and more enticing. Few story arcs passed by without me getting majorly distracted by several different things along the way, and while location types are not always unique, each generally features a clever bit of puzzling to find hidden loot, or an interesting layout of enemies upon which to test my battle skills. Early chapters in Valhalla's narrative skew towards a strong Viking flavour - raiding with your longship, castle assaults and the like - that are later balanced to some degree by the game's cities: dense areas that encourage you to spend several hours at a time scurrying around rooftops well away from your Viking crew and longboat. These are, of course, relatively small when compared to the floor space of the city-set games of the past. Still, they will make early Assassin's Creed fans feel very much at home in terms of the gameplay on offer: investigation-style activities, treasure hunts, rooftop assassinations, and even the series' first tailing mission in what feels like years. Vinland, meanwhile, offers the traditional 'let's put the main character somewhere completely different with none of their usual gear' section, while not walling Eivor in there for however long it takes you to complete its arc. Fans of Assassin's Creed 3 are the ones being treated here, with treetop parkour and long sections voiced entirely in Native American language. (Oh, and eight years later, the kayaks which got cut from that game are finally now usable.)Valhalla slowly builds up Eivor's abilities, though I never got to the point where I felt as powered up as Kassandra in Odyssey (even if the lore nerd in me acknowledges Kassandra was able to wield an essentially-magical artefact to do so). Still, combat feels refined, far more bloody, and meatier overall now with three gauges to keep an eye on (health, stamina for things like dodging, and your special ability bar). Valhalla offers a sprawling skill web, nodes of which you'll unlock at regular XP milestones, in order to access numerous passive abilities. Meanwhile, Books of Knowledge found within the game's world gift specific abilities you can choose eight (four melee, four ranged) to have active at any one time. The best of these are the ones that spice up the variety of options available to Eivor while stuck in the middle of fights, such as the skills to stomp on prone foes, or pick up and throw discarded weapons, as well as the risky but fun super-assassinate move which lets you one-shot foes while undetected if you complete its time-sensitive mini-game. I liked combining this with the thrown axe double assassinate skill to get two super-assassinations at a time. There's also an option buried within Valhalla's options menu to switch on automatic one-shot assassinations - a fan-requested feature, interestingly included here despite its description warning players this is not how Ubisoft intends the game to be played. There are several other changes from Odyssey that initially take some adjustment. Your raven drone has been significantly nerfed from the eagles of the past, and no longer lets you automatically tag items or enemies you're after (you can manually tag three, but in an enemy-dense area this is not a lot of help). It's a frustrating change that impacts the ease at which you can stealth through larger combat zones, and it  results in more detections by enemies you otherwise have to keep pinging using your fiddly R3 button Odin Sight. Fall damage is back, negatable up to a certain extent but no longer fully escapable. Gear is now permanent but upgradable - a change I found left me less likely to swap between items after pumping resources into a build that worked well enough. And while it's nice to be able to take the weapons you began with to the story's finale, finding base level items in the open world even in the late game can often be underwhelming. While we're talking annoyances, we should also talk about bugs. For reference, I'm playing Valhalla on a retail Xbox Series X, and with the launch day build of the game available when the game releases tomorrow. At the time of writing, the one major bugbear I have is with its screen-tearing, which usually occurs in mocapped sequences when there are multiple characters moving around on screen, though sometimes also appears in busy areas of general gameplay such as assaults within the interior of a castle. I've spoken to others with similar experiences and know Ubisoft is aware of the problem, though the suggestion I got for a fix did not solve the issue. In the grand scheme of things, these are minor annoyances in a vast experience, and while there changes from Odyssey to adjust to, I also know some of these will result in a mechanically more traditional entry that may be welcomed by some. Indeed, as both Quebec and Montreal teams continue to alternate on releasing Assassin's Creed games, it is perhaps only natural the two build on each other's accomplishments while keeping their own styles - and there is so much to enjoy in Valhalla, a game that simultaneously feels a worthy wrap-up for the series' recent forays into ancient history, a strong first entry for next-gen consoles this year, and one which lays important groundwork for the franchise's future.It's this future I'm thinking of as I reflect on the series' recent past, and on a painful year for those affected by a culture of problems within Ubisoft. Valhalla is the work of many hundreds of people - not just its former creative director who, as far as I can tell, no longer holds a place in Valhalla's credits. It is the work of many of the same people who created Origins, and who wanted Aya to have a more prominent role there, not just the studio heads and editorial team who thought otherwise. And it is the work of developers who recently reached out to the ACSisterhood fan initiative, to include their community within the final game.
Just over two years ago, I reviewed Assassin's Creed Odyssey and recommended it thoroughly, while still looking forward to polishing off its remaining parts. Two years on, I feel like I'm at a similar point with Valhalla. Since then, the already enormous Odyssey has grown bigger (I still play it every week), and the same will also be true of Valhalla. The series' first free seasonal content will arrive before Christmas, bringing new abilities, missions and yuletide items to your Viking settlement. Similar updates will follow through every season of 2021, separate from the game's upcoming paid-for Ireland and Paris expansions, and the now traditional Discovery Tour mode to follow. Before all of that though, Valhalla already feels complete. It is a Viking saga which does at times struggle a little in reaching its destiny, and in its efforts to evolve the series has made some sacrifices to tell a stronger overall story. But it wins through, in the end quite easily, as it continues the Assassin's Creed saga for a new generation.You're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!

Link assassinscreed.com (opens in new tab)Assassin's Creed Valhalla is my favorite Assassin's Creed, which is saying something considering it's a series that spans 23 games. It builds on the already excellent RPG foundations laid by Origins and Odyssey, but with meaningful improvements that iron out many of the frustrations I had with both games. Case in point: Not once during the 60-hour story was I told to stop and level up a bunch before I could take on the next quest. That also means Ubisoft isn't selling optional experience boosts, either. Thank god.What really stands out to me, though, is how much better Valhalla is at telling an engaging story that twists and turns according to my decisions. In Odyssey, my choices sometimes felt arbitrary or confusing, but Valhalla does a great job of introducing characters, concepts, and themes, and then forcing me to decide how Eivor, the main character, relates to them. When one of my beloved own clansmen betrayed me and tried to take my life, I had no choice but to kill them in self defense. But I agonized for almost a full minute over whether to let them grasp their axe with their dying breath or kick it away, denying them entrance into Valhalla. I had come to love this character and their betrayal was upsetting, but does that justify denying them an eternity in heaven?What really impresses me, though, is how consistently great the story is throughout the entire adventure.Set during the Viking Invasion of England, the story follows Eivor and her adoptive brother Sigurd, two fierce Norse warriors chasing glory. Like Odyssey, Eivor can be played as either a man or a woman, but what's great is you can now switch between them freely to test which one suits you instead of being locked into that choice from the outset. Whichever Eivor you play as, the story unfolds in mostly the same way. Sigurd was supposed to be made a local king, but the unification of Norway under King Harald leaves him two choices: Bend the knee or leave. Unwilling to give up his dream of ruling, Sigurd convinces Eivor and much of his clan to abandon Norway and sail to England so they can violently carve out a new future.The anchor of this story is my settlement, called Ravensthorpe, which expands slowly over time as I gather new resources and construct new buildings. Like Dutch's camp in Red Dead Redemption 2, the settlement is my home base that I return to frequently in between quests. New buildings unlock new upgrades, like a forge so I can enhance my equipment or a brewery so I can host feasts that give me a temporary buff to my stats. As the settlement expands, it draws new characters, sidequests, and even the opportunity for romance. When huntress Petra asked me to help her look for her missing brother, for example, we ended up accidentally tripping on some magic mushrooms we found and chasing forest creatures instead. Like any good trip, we bonded and became lovers a few dates later.Even though many of the characters aren't as fully realized and vivid as in Red Dead Redemption 2, I love how Valhalla's settlement encourages me to get to know my clan. Instead of completing side quests for random strangers I find while exploring, like in Odyssey, I'm helping my blacksmith find a wife, or my museum curator settle a feud. Each one is a narrative thread that, woven together, tells the collective story of the Raven clan.Most of the story is concerned with what's happening outside the borders of my settlement, however. In order to cement a permanent place in England, Eivor and Sigurd have to negotiate alliances with the various Viking tribes (and the occasional Saxon king). This is all centered around an Alliance Map, where I choose which region I want to venture to, participating in a somewhat self-enclosed series of quests to win the favor of whichever faction happens to be there.At first this structure seemed too templated and isolated, but once the story gets going characters from one region will pop up in the story of another, giving a nice sense of continuity between these otherwise independent chapters. What really impresses me, though, is how consistently great the story is throughout the entire adventure, even as it takes astounding detours to places far beyond England and Norway. That's something I can't really say for any other Assassin's Creed games, including Odyssey.It takes a while before it all starts to come together, but Ubisoft does a great job juxtaposing my relationships with Sigurd and the rest of the Raven clan with the much more epic sagas as I wage war on Picts with the legendary Halfdan Ragnarsson, establish puppet kings with Ivar the Boneless, or trade veiled threats with Aelfred, King of Wessex. All the while, dialogue choices poke and prod the rigidity of Norse culture and traditions with surprising nuance. It's hard to explain without spoiling specific moments, but Valhalla has some wickedly knotted moral conundrums. There were a dozen or more times I stared at dialogue choices, completely stumped over which option was right.There are still some moments where Valhalla feels like a bad Game of Thrones episode, though. Entire armies show up undetected at a moment's notice, and characters will inexplicably change sides in a conflict just to reveal they're actually a part of the Templar order—the overarching villains of the Assassin's Creed mythos. These cutscenes are relatively few and far between, and ultimately this is a game about two warring cults reliving historical simulations to uncover mythological artifacts in the modern day—a bit of cheese is expected. But, and I can't believe I'm about to say this, Valhalla even makes Assassin's Creed's sloppy overarching meta-narrative interesting again. Without spoiling anything, the final two hours are a whirlwind of revelations with implications that stretch all the way back to the first game. God help me, I actually want to see what happens next.Raiding feels like a shallow feature clumsily stitched onto the rest of the game.I love that the Norwegian invaders are portrayed as so much more than vicious barbarians, but it also ignores more troubling aspects of that era of history completely. It feels like a wayward extension of Ubisoft's feeble reluctance to admit its games have political messages.Take raiding, for example. To gather resources to expand my settlement, I have to pillage Christian monasteries dotted along the various riverways of England's different kingdoms. The first few times I did this, it was exhilarating: My soldiers stormed the town, hurling torches onto thatched-roof cottages, slaughtering the guards, breaking windows, shattering pots and crates, and helping me kick down doors to get at more valuable loot. But god help you if you kill an unarmed clergyman, even by accident. Kill too many and it's game over. Burning their entire lives to the ground, however, is totally OK. I'm not saying Valhalla should gleefully reward you for butchering Christians, but including a hard rule against it feels like Ubisoft intervening just to wag a finger in my face. It's even stranger when I start a quest with a Saxon lord who completely ignores the fact that I pillaged every church in his lands on the way to meet him. It makes raiding feel like a shallow feature clumsily stitched onto the rest of the game rather than something incorporated into and accounted for by the story. Ubisoft could've invented a narrative reason why Eivor doesn't kill innocents or just made priests really good at dodging thrown axes when they're fleeing for the hills. Instead I'm given a warning message that completely pulls me out of the moment. I have a similar problem with Valhalla's Assaults—the big set piece castle sieges that typically act as the climax of a given regional questline. I'd never expect Ubisoft to go to the pains of simulating a full battle from start to finish, but the illusion of participating in one is paper thin. I'll use a battering ram to smash down the castle gate only to find my own soldiers are inexplicably already inside the castle and locked in never-ending mock combat with enemy soldiers. There's no sense of a battle having an ebb and flow, and so long as I complete my objectives the fight will progress in my favor.Both of these issues would be a lot more frustrating if combat weren't so much fun. The system is similar to Odyssey's in a lot of ways, but much more satisfying. For example, I can now dual-wield any two weapons, changing my combat style while also giving me access to special moves unique to my offhand weapon. Playing on a harder difficulty, I immediately favored the traditional axe and shield for the extra defense. But then I unlocked an ability on Valhalla's skill tree that let me dual-wield two-handed weapons. What a game changer.Instead of sporting a measly axe, I'm holding a two-handed battle axe in one hand and a massive spear in the other—or I can hold two spears and be extra stabby, or two shields and be extra shieldy. It's so much fun discovering all of these combinations. And no matter what weapons I choose, I know I'm going to be both horrified and amazed at just how artfully Eivor can use them to separate people from their limbs.It's hard to overstate just how gnarly some of the finishing movies are. I've repeatedly knocked enemies down and then impaled them on their own spears, or chopped their hands off as they raised them to defend against the axe I was about to lodge in their skull. There's even one where Eivor sticks an axe in a guy's face and then punches his head off. It's exactly what you'd hope for in a game about Vikings.Of course, stealth is still an option, but it's quickly becoming the most antiquated part of Assassin's Creed—if only because so little of it has changed. Valhalla brings back some cool features like being able to blend into crowds to avoid guards and creating distractions to draw them away, but I'm often frustrated by how shitty the AI continues to be. Guards are dumb, and you can easily lure them into bushes one after another to assassinate them, and when one does spot you it feels like every guard within five miles immediately knows where you are. These are the same problems I've had in every Assassin's Creed, sure, but they're still annoying. At least Valhalla is more willing to let me forgo stealth entirely in all but a few quests. Being a sneaky Viking doesn't feel appropriate, anyway. On my i7 8700 and RTX 2070, I'm getting 60-70 fps using 1440p and high settings. There's occasional dips, but overall I'm impressed with Valhalla's performance. It's absolutely gorgeous, too.Like most Ubisoft games, though, this might not be your experience. Other members at PC Gamer had to really mess with options for a long time just to get stable performance, and Valhalla demands a beefy system if you hope to get remotely good framerates. Even with top-tier hardware, expect to spend some time messing with the different options and a few hiccups. If your CPU or GPU are a few generations old, you'll have to make some compromises.The combat isn't all just flash, though. There are 23 different human enemy types that each have their own distinct weapons and combat styles, which makes fights feel dynamic and often quite challenging. It's more varied than any other Assassin's Creed. Rogues will kick dirt in your eyes to blind you, while Ceorl's will swap weapons with dead allies, 'Berserkirs' will pelt you with thrown axes while they run you down. Knowing the attack patterns and timing of these enemies takes patience and skill.Fortunately, Eivor has more tools than just the weapons she wields. While exploring, special books can be found that unlock new abilities, like being able to set your weapon on fire or a harpoon you can use to yank enemies off cliffs. This, coupled with a skill tree that recalls Path of Exile—hundreds of nodes that offer incremental stat boosts mixed with bigger ability unlocks—makes customizing Eivor really fun.This all feeds back into the open world exploration, which remains largely untouched from Odyssey saved for a few improvements. The map is still littered with icons in typical Ubisoft fashion, but you can (and should) turn that all off in the options so that you can explore without signposts everywhere. Most of the stuff you'll find is new equipment and treasure you can take back home or use for upgrades, but I also found hidden caves with challenging puzzles, secret boss battles, and weird little one-off quests that are often bizarre and sometimes hilarious. One time I happened upon a Viking who didn't realize he had an axe lodged in his skull. He asked me what he should do so I offered to remove it, and he died instantly. That was it. Quest completed, I guess?Valhalla succeeds on so many levels that it's easy to forgive the times when it doesn't.These activities all reward you with skill points you can spend in the skill tree. But, like I said earlier, Valhalla doesn't use this as a way to gate your progress through the story. Different regions still have power levels you have to match if you hope to survive the enemies there, so you can't go anywhere you want right away. But aside from doing a little exploring, I mostly blitzed through the story without ever feeling forced to go off and do something else to level up.These little improvements go a long way in making Valhalla more inviting and fun than Odyssey. Assassin's Creed's transformation into a full-blown RPG hasn't been the cleanest one, especially as features like stealth feel left to stagnate while other aspects get so much better. But Valhalla succeeds on so many levels that it's easy to forgive the times when it doesn't. It's an enormous game, and it'll probably take me another 20 hours to finish everything I still haven't completed. I honestly can't wait.Bloody and captivating, Valhalla is Assassin's Creed at its best.With over 7 years of experience with in-depth feature reporting, Steven's mission is to chronicle the fascinating ways that games intersect our lives. Whether it's colossal in-game wars in an MMO, or long-haul truckers who turn to games to protect them from the loneliness of the open road, Steven tries to unearth PC gaming's greatest untold stories.

Assassin's Creed Valhalla,Nick Gillett,Metro GameCentral,https://metro.co.uk/2020/11/10/assassins-creed-valhalla-review-ragnarok-n-roll-13571014/,"Ubisoft’s open world Viking adventure is one of the biggest multiformat releases this Christmas but how does it compare to previous entries?Assassin’s Creed is a franchise that’s been around long enough that it’s starting to run out of historical eras in which to set its almost annual instalments. Valhalla returns to the series’ temporal roots with a trip back to the Dark Ages, this time in ninth century Norway and England rather than the original’s Jerusalem, although this outing also brings along a number of the game’s more recent innovations to help keep you busy.Starting in a snow-covered but jolly Viking village, the bonhomie is short-lived, as the settlement gets raided, your character’s parents and their friends slaughtered, and your protagonist taken in by a friendly neighbouring king. Not shying away from the fact that Vikings made slaves of their captured enemies, it still tries to portray them as an honourable people despite their love of a good pillage.Your first choice is whether the game’s protagonist Eivor is male, female, or if you want to leave it up to the Animus (the device that lets modern humans play through large stretches of historical people’s lives) to switch Eivor’s sex at critical moments in the story. We played as a female Eivor, but that’s entirely optional and seems to make only cosmetic differences to the game itself.Apart from that complication, Valhalla is in almost all ways Assassin’s Creed business as usual. On a sprawling map you’ll once again need to climb high points to ‘synchronise’ new chunks of the landscape, revealing monasteries and villages to raid, treasures to discover, and what the game calls ‘world events’.Those aren’t quite side quests so much as minor incidents built around often pretty offbeat characters and their problems. The franchise as a whole tends towards relentless poker face, and world events are really the only place it manages to display a sense of humour, as you chat to the various weirdos who either need help with something or weakly try to rob you, letting you lay waste to their unfortunate bandit buddies.In recent Assassin’s Creed games you had access to an eagle that was effectively the drone in Ghost Recon, letting you scout the landscape, highlight bad guys, and spot loot pick-ups. This time around you have a raven, and it no longer auto-targets enemies. For that you’ll need to get in close and use your Odin Sight, the refreshed name for Eagle Vision from the earlier games.The net effect is that you can no longer conveniently scope everything out from a distance, before sneaking forwards and mopping up enemies with your bow. You now need to plunge into the thick of things to find and eliminate guards and spot treasures, some of which can be extremely well hidden. This often demands some environmental problem solving, smashing crates to slither through gaps or dropping heavy boxes on weakened boards to open underground tunnels.Fighting has now changed significantly. Battles have a weightier feel, and no longer are you encouraged to be stealth-only. Raids, a major facet of being a Viking, favour all-out attacks where you charge in bellowing, rather than creeping in using your bow and hidden blade. That means mixing parries, dodges, and shield-based defence with light and heavy attacks to overcome often quite large groups of enemies. It’s not quite the Souls-Bjorn it would like to be, but it’s a more interesting system than recent games.That’s not to say stealth doesn’t also play a part though. Taking down outposts solo is still a mainly quiet affair, ducking into shrubbery to avoid detection, picking off foes when nobody else is looking, and whistling quietly to attract single guards so you take them down without causing an alert. Valhalla also sees the return of social blending from the early Assassin’s Creeds, where instead of out-and-out hiding, you can pull up your hood and sit on a bench or shuffle along with the locals.This being a very long time ago, the Templars are still prototypical, calling themselves The Order of the Ancients. Their chiefs and the zealots that make up their rank and file become your targets, in a campaign to rid England of their vile influence. Initially they’re impossibly tough, with armour and attacks that so massively outclass anything you’re capable of that there’s no point even trying, but soon enough you’ll unlock sufficient upgrades to be able to turn the tables.Skill points arrive in pairs, letting you open up nodes on a Final Fantasy X-style skill tree, that remains invisible until you unlock neighbouring branches. Although initially that feels unnecessarily confusing you soon realise that the order in which you unlock stuff doesn’t really matter that much. Yes, you can favour attacks over stealth if that’s the way your Eivor likes to do business, but eventually you’ll end up with similar bonuses anyway as you gain access to more and more of the tree.Separate from that are abilities, which you acquire through reading special books. Each has a single upgrade level unlocked by finding a duplicate book, and you’ll often have to do a good bit of puzzling and exploration to locate them in their underground cellars, the entrances to which are barred, forcing you to find alternative routes underground. It’s an interesting way of adding challenge without simply throwing in legions of extra enemies.Along with crowd blending, Valhalla also sees the welcome return of the assassin’s hidden wrist blade, although this time it’s upgradeable and often isn’t enough to kill tougher enemies in a single strike. For basic cannon fodder it’s more than enough however and remains a satisfying and silent way of dispatching guards without anyone being any the wiser.Beyond the moment-to-moment jobs of raids, assassinations, and treasure hunting, there’s an extensive meta game in which you use pilfered supplies to build and upgrade your English settlement. That gives you access to better weapons, a more pimped-out longboat, and Jomsvikings, the Assassin’s Creed equivalent of Dragon’s Dogma pawns – computer-controlled allies that you hire out to other players online.You’ll also need to build influence with local clans, helping them out by razing their enemies, returning recently captured strongholds to them, and generally being a good neighbour. It helps add a little shape to what might otherwise feel like a somewhat formless enterprise, which despite its variety, still amounts to little more than a bunch of disparate tasks.Whether all this makes you salivate with anticipation or feel tired inside is largely a question of where you stand on the question of Ubisoft open world games. Ghost Recon, Far Cry, Watch Dogs, and Assassin’s Creed now share such obviously similar DNA that if you like one, the chances are you’ll enjoy the others – but the opposite is also true. Anyone sick and tired of mildly repetitive, sprawling open worlds will find every single thing they hate in Valhalla.Still, if you’ve got a hundred hours to kill, and enjoy spending time wheedling your way through a recalcitrant underground entrance, or toying with distractions like tactical dice game, Orlog; competitive drinking from animal horns; or Flyting, the historically accurate insult-based viking rap battles, then Assassin’s Creed is a game of rare size and scope.The game offers an ultra-stylised take on its historical settings, the blood red sunsets and god rays of Norway, and the gold-infused greenery of an England that really never was, but as in feature films, where everything’s turned up to 11 for extra visual impact, it really works, with almost every scene looking like a Turner painting. As a backdrop to its larger-than-life characters it feels like the right decision.The PS5 second phase is going to be worse than the first - Reader’s FeatureGames Inbox: Is Halo a dead franchise?Why is Horizon Forbidden West so boring? - Reader’s FeatureThis wouldn’t be a Ubisoft game without its share of glitches though and unfortunately the PlayStation 4 version has plenty. Speech that pauses or stutters, controller vibration that keep going on uncontrollably during cut scenes, or a civilian walking on the spot atop a guard tower. Even the load screens aren’t safe, with Eivor occasionally appearing with slanting grey bars connecting her with the ground. None completely ruins the game, but they do undermine the atmosphere.So for better and for worse, Valhalla is every inch an Assassin’s Creed game. It’s huge, varied and mildly disjointed, but also rich, satisfying, and frequently great fun. The FromSoftware inspired battles are a distinct improvement and Valhalla has got some decent mini-games, if that’s your cup of tea, but it also suffers from manifold glitches at launch. With a bit of luck they’ll be patched up in due course, but as it stands this is a game that falls a few metres short of true brilliance.In Short: A vast and multi-faceted trip through a stylised Viking life, with a new fighting system, manifold mini-games and diversions, and untold glitches. It’s Assassin’s Creed to its core.Pros: The mix of stealth and battle charge raids makes a nice change of pace, with combat more exciting than usual. It looks beautiful throughout and it’ll keep you out of trouble for weeks.Cons: Many bugs. The open world is large and relatively empty, a problem exacerbated if you turn down the HUD settings. Conversational choices rarely seem important and side missions feel flyweight and inconsequential.Score: 7/10Formats: PlayStation 4 (reviewed), Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, PC, and StadiaPrice: £59.99Publisher: UbisoftDeveloper: Ubisoft MontrealRelease Date: 10th November 2020 (19/11 on PS5)Age Rating: 18Email gamecentral@metro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter.

Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy.Assassin’s Creed Valhalla has a tailing mission in its main campaign. A very knowing one, full of complaints from Viking Eivor at their target’s speed, but a tailing mission nonetheless. But why start here in a review when there is a sprawling Mercia to celebrate with a raised horn of mead? A frankly ludicrously beautiful world of rolling hills, mystical snowy castle ruins, and the eventual ability to dual wield a longsword and a gleaming axe bigger than most of the inhabitants of your settlement. Oh, and the fact that you can ride a giant wolf instead of a horse, who’ll come lolloping into view at the press of a button and growl with a satisfying low rumble not unlike a truck engine...   It's because that tailing mission is important though, vital even. Don’t worry, there’s only that one but it’s important to address straight away that Valhalla has managed to perfectly rekindle the fires of the traditional Assassin’s Creed experience. One where hay is key and endless ropes stretch helpfully across villain-filled streets. And yes, it’s lit these embers with a torch and a roar. #JustPillagingThings? Release date: November 10, 2020
Platform(s): PS4, Xbox One, PS5, Xbox Series X, PC
Developer/Publisher: UbisoftIf there have been any complaints about the sprawling RPG-osity of both Assassin's Creed Origins and Assassin's Creed Odyssey, it’s that the AC bloodline has been watered down, sacrificed on the altar of narrative decision making and endless loot. Assassin's Creed Valhalla effortlessly brings the two concepts back together, marrying the art of the assassination (complete with a gratifying gory ‘hidden blade vision’ addition) with grand castle sieges with volleys of arrows, shooting down drawbridges with a satisfying thunk, and the unmistakeable glooping of boiling oil. A Hidden Ones Bureau is one of your earliest constructions in your settlement. As ironic as an Assassins symbol hanging outside a building on a shop sign is, this is a world where you can go contract killing and finding clues with your hood up, but also arrive at monasteries with the echoing war bellow of your horn, readying your axes for some serious, not to mention exhilarating, beheading. But how does it manage to do this? Put simply, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is huge. With the biggest campaign of an Assassin’s Creed game so far - I clocked in at 63 hours to take over the war room’s alliance map and see the finale - this is a saga worthy of the poet Eivor and mead-drenched tales around the campfire for the centuries to come.To remain entirely spoiler free, I’ll just say that Eivor’s Raven Clan arrives in 9th Century England, settles down in a peaceful wooded area, and decides to make alliances across the tumultuous Mercia - which feels a lot like arriving in a tantalising Viking theme park. Taking over one unique area at a time feels like a natural way to progress through the story, forging friends and enemies, and building an understanding of the power struggles that keep Mercia so divided. The hunt for peace really isn’t so peaceful, even if you do occasionally decide to stay your blade. Each region has its own distinct geography, spanning from the picturesque barren shores of Cent to the pleasant pagan Hobbity greenery of Glowcesterscire. Every journey in Valhalla feels incredible, whether you’re letting your longship do the hard work and taking in the panoramic view option, or hoofing it over the countryside with Jesper Kyd and cos swelling atmospheric score in your ears. The cities too, especially the bustling and tightly-packed Roman Lunden, make for perfect reminders of AC cities of yore. These are worlds of verticality and pillars with nods to AC Brotherhood and more than a hint of air assassination. Which, brilliantly, are possible even with high-level enemies.Unlock a skill in the sprawling skill tree called Advanced Assassination and a mini-game will pop up every time you press the assassinate button, giving you a chance to get a moving marker in a zone to finish the deal. It’s a perfect way to balance old and new, meaning boss battles can be dodged entirely if you play your blade right but there’s no reason to worry if you just want to embed axes in limbs. But more on that in a bit. Known as ‘arcs’, each region’s story comes with the decision making that Odyssey defined, and your actions can have serious consequences. Accuse the wrong Saxon of treachery or install the wrong Ealdorman and your poor decision making will come back to haunt you or y’know, stab someone in front of you. On the whole, this is satisfying with some pleasantly unexpected twists. The brilliant Eivor’s word is law and while some decisions seem clear cut, others are much more morally murky. Quest wise though, sometimes it can be a little unclear where you’ll find clues to back up your decisions and the default ‘explorer’ setting will mean constantly sending your raven skyward to check your next blue-highlighted section of the map. It’s very occasional but feels like a misstep in an otherwise confident system full of all manner of ultra varied quests.No Creed game has been badly written but the Vikings setting has added a glorious insult game to the mix - tottering teat sucker anyone? - and Valhalla’s script is hidden blade sharp. A warrior called Ivarr is a particularly entertaining standout character with no patience for peace and a comedian’s tongue. The conversations with Odin too in some surprisingly dark cinematic Viking versions of the traditional ‘white room’ make for some troubling viewing. Combo the best written Creed with the addition of a charisma bar to unlock extra useful conversation options and things get interesting. Flyting opportunities, or Viking rap battles, can be found in most towns, demanding quick thinking and a penchant for rhyme. It’s not easy at first but you’ll get there in time…  But the heart of Assassin’s Creed Valhalla isn’t in its quick insults, it’s your settlement and the relationships you form there. And yes, some of them are romantic but don’t expect the sprawling romance options of Odyssey. Eivor’s bedroom opportunities are less throwaway but equally fun. This collection of buildings starts out small but do enough raids and steal enough supplies and you can gradually build a full-on village. Repeated trips home to Randvi to report your progress and checking in everywhere makes for a compelling loop that’s constantly rewarding. Everything you collect can be brought back. Hidden One Hytham - yes, I see you, Ubisoft - takes the medallions of the Order of the Ancients members you bring down in exchange for powerful abilities, the hunter's hut is ready for your spoils, and there’s even a museum for Roman Artefacts, meaning that even your most distracted of open-world activities will always give you a digital pat on the back. The settlement evolves throughout the campaign too, letting the decisions you’ve made influence its inhabitants. This means that even if there are really only two main endings, your settlement arrangement and longship crew can be very different from everyone else's. This is your community and it constantly feels like home to tell your stories of war. You can even make it your own aesthetically with sections for custom decorations. Why can’t I get skull piles like that in IKEA, eh? One other major addition is Valka, your seer, who with the help of a potion can take you to two mythical universes. Incredibly, these are almost the size of Odyssey’s DLC realms, beautiful and, in one case, packed with wish fulfilment, but a surprising addition in an already vast world.  The settlement too is the only place you can properly spec your weapons and gear, with blacksmith Gunnar upgrading each piece from superior to flawless and then up to mythical. It’s here where Valhalla breaks the trend of the previous two Creeds where we were drowning in weaponry and gear, constantly dismantling for loot. Instead, specific armour pieces can be found in chests across the world, each with their own playstyle benefits. Each piece can be levelled up with iron and you’ll be juggling rune slots to make the most of your combat style. It initially feels restrictive after the bounties of Origins and Odyssey but quickly feels like each piece suddenly has value and each upgrade is a decision to ponder. Do you spec everything up equally or build yourself a mega axe? Speaking of axes, Valhalla’s combat is significantly evolved. A dual wield system means Eivor can defend with a shield while raining down light and heavy attacks with an axe, but equally can pop another axe or hammer in their left hand. No-one is queuing up here to take a swing at you with Mercia’s wide range of enemies all attacking at once, meaning knowing when to dodge and use up precious stamina or parry is vital. Whether you’re facing bannermen or, my own personal nemesis, pikemen with spears, breaking down defences is constantly an enjoyably hefty challenge. The new ration system too means no refilling health, which can often go badly wrong if you aren’t holding enough mushrooms and a band of enemies get nasty. It’s a great balance of challenge and skill, making stealth a valuable and thankfully now viable option if you’re not ready for the fight.  Remember though. This is a Viking game. A history of warriors written in blood and as the saga goes on, every skill point upgrade and ability means the combat only goes from strength to strength. The skill tree is frankly intimidating, stretching enticingly off on unseen strands hidden under a fog of war. But level up and you’ll reveal the ability to throw dropped weapons at foes, freeze time for a matter of seconds with a perfect dodge and roll over an enemy’s back as they use their unparriable rune attack. Suddenly combat situations become perfect opportunities to combo your favourite skills, and it’s a relief that you can fully respec your skill tree to make sure you’re heading in the right direction. You’ll know that when you’re gleefully watching yet another animation of Eivor annihilating a heavy enemy with their own weapon.  Then though, there’s everything else and the wonder of this world. Watching the sunrise over a standing stones puzzle, gleefully running your wolf alongside surprised deer in lush forests, building cairns at the top of a mountain pass, destroying cursed objects hidden in echoing caves deep below the ground. This is an Assassin’s Creed game - are you even playing one if sometimes you stand on things instead of standing next to them? - but this is another glorious realm of possibility. An intimidatingly huge, atmospheric world of mysteries to solve but now with even more opportunities. There’s also an intriguing central mystery with a frankly catnip lore ending for longtime AC fans and some WTF moments for everyone else. Stronger, bolder, and with a welcome reintroduction of the best bits of the older games, Valhalla is a roaring bloodied success with a true heart. Reviewed on Xbox Series X where we experienced occasional screen tearing in busy and built-up areas.Louise Blain is a journalist and broadcaster specialising in gaming, technology, and entertainment.

Assassin's Creed Valhalla,Joe Juba,Game Informer,https://www.gameinformer.com/review/assassins-creed-valhalla/assassins-creed-valhalla-review-a-saga-worthy-of-song,"The Assassin’s Creed franchise draws people in for many reasons. Over the years, it has provided stealth-focused infiltration, stylish encounters, high-seas adventures, and other elements – but not always in equal measure. Each installment hits different sweet spots for different players with varying degrees of success, but for the first time in the series, the balance feels perfect in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla. With its engaging combination of combat, open-world exploration, crafted story content, and settlement management, this Viking saga is an epic with a little something for everyone.Though Valhalla embodies a fascinating evolution for Assassin’s Creed, you don’t need any familiarity with the franchise to appreciate the tale of Eivor and the Raven Clan’s incursion into Anglo-Saxon England. It’s a massive story with small beginnings, following your Norse hero’s attempts to forge alliances in hostile territory. Eivor’s effort to create a new home brings together a variety of compelling loops that capture the adventurous Viking spirit; you can hunt legendary animals, track down new pieces of gear, or ride your longship down the riverways. Every time I left the clan’s settlement of Ravensthorpe, I had to choose between multiple tempting paths. This wealth of enticing options made me feel like a warrior at a feast with more delicious mead and meat than any one person could ever consume. Valhalla’s open-world content is deliberate and purposeful; apart from an overabundance of collectibles, nothing feels like unnecessary padding. Special world events called “mysteries” are the best example of this approach, replacing traditional sidequests. Mysteries aren’t generic objectives like “kill the bandits” or “loot the chest.” Instead, they are authored scenarios that may present specific challenges or simply tell funny stories. For instance, I had to fight an old man who lamented his own undefeatable punching skill, count an ever-changing number of stones, and steal a piece of valuable art from a snob. Mysteries are short and contained to small areas, so they are more like fun diversions than logged quests you feel obligated to finish. But you should finish them anyway, because they are well-written and memorable, adding surprising flavor to the characters and the world.Brutal combat is a hallmark of the Viking legend, and it’s an area where Valhalla builds upon the solid foundation of its predecessors. The sheer god-like power of your hero has been toned down compared to Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, but Eivor is still a powerhouse . Fights feel like chaotic melee brawls rather than elegant dances of death; this can make some encounters feel too unfocused, but they also have a grounded sensation, with lots of clanging metal and splintering wood. Eivor can easily take on a crowd of foes, and the variety of different enemy types keeps you thinking just enough to keep the fray from devolving into button-mashing. The one-on-one boss fights are less consistent, sometimes straining the mechanics beyond what they can comfortably accomplish.  A huge skill tree and an array of abilities give you plenty of freedom with how you build your character, with a good selection of passive and active bonuses that allow you to bend or break the usual rules of engagement. You find and purchase different weapons – swords, flails, spears, etc. – and equip them in each hand to find a combination you like. I spent a lot of time dual-wielding huge axes thanks to a skill I bought that lets you hold two-handed weapons in a single hand. When I got overwhelmed, I fell back on my desperation tactic: using sleep arrows to incapacitate enemies mid-fight, then closing in for the assassination as they drifted off to sleep. It’s not exactly the most honorable path to victory, but it is hilarious and effective.Eivor’s exploits are all fun individually, but I’m most impressed by how they all interact harmoniously. You get cool new gear and abilities through exploration, which makes you more formidable in combat. That means you can hunt more powerful members of the Order of the Ancients or raid villages in more dangerous regions for valuable supplies. Your accomplishments in the world feed back into your settlement, and managing Ravensthorpe is one of Valhalla’s highlights. It is deeper than the base-building in previous installments, and the structures you build have major effects. Building a barracks allows you to create a Viking lieutenant you can share with your friends, while erecting a home for the seer lets Eivor delve into strange visions. Most new facilities come with some additional feature or quest, and I enjoyed seeing my humble collection of huts gradually grow into a thriving town.Ravensthorpe is where you consolidate your power, but much of your time is spent exploring the countryside. The stone castles and foggy swamps of 9th-Century England don’t have the same magnificent splendor of Ancient Greece or Egypt, but they are still full of secrets and picturesque scenes. Alongside some time spent in Norway (and other areas), this backdrop gives Valhalla its own colorful and earthy beauty. The narrative is smartly broken up into location-based arcs as Eivor attempts to win friends in different regions. This provides the satisfaction of completing many separate stories, all while working toward your larger goal of prosperity for the Raven Clan. Some larger threads (which I won't ruin here) connect these tales, and I like how they are standalone sequences with their own payoffs. I never needed to grind in order to advance the plot, and I also appreciate how Eivor never gets bogged down with too much talk. While you can choose some dialogue and make a few important choices, you aren’t constantly navigating conversation trees, which keeps the story moving in each territory. However, don't expect to reach the saga's finale quickly; I played for over 70 hours, and that's without taking a completionist approach to exploration.The content and design of Valhalla are the best the series has seen in years, but the technical frustrations are disappointingly familiar. I encountered several companion A.I. bugs, creepy child NPCs who were adult-sized, and quest-givers who wouldn't talk to me – all alongside other graphical and audio glitches. Objectively, I can't deny these problems are jarring and inconvenient. But on a practical level, none of them are severe enough to significantly dampen my enjoyment; the consequences usually aren't any worse than reloading an autosave and losing a few minutes of progress. I'd rather not deal with those issues, but the failures are light when weighed against the heft of Valhalla's successes.  I loved 2018’s Assassin’s Creed Odyssey (especially after its post-release support), but that love was always tempered by a desire for improvements. I wished the content felt more carefully curated. I hated grinding to progress the story. I got sick of managing an inventory bloated with loot. Assassin’s Creed Valhalla addresses all of those issues and more, creating a rewarding experience at every turn, whether you’re pursuing the main narrative or hunting down treasure. I'm sure Valhalla is not the perfect Assassin’s Creed game for all players, but it is certainly my new favorite entry.My time playing Assassin’s Creed Valhalla for review was spent exclusively on Xbox Series X. The graphics look great, and the faster loading times should be an immediately relief to anyone who has played an Assassin’s Creed game in the last seven years. However, I also hit occasional framerate drops and persistent screen tearing. These technical trade-offs prevent Valhalla from being a standard-bearer for the next generation of hardware, though aspects of its performance remain impressive.Other Game Informer editors have been playing the current-gen iteration on PS4. They are reporting longer loading times, as well as scattered performance issues in the game's audio, graphics, and animation. Considering all those factors, playing Valhalla on next-gen systems is the way to see it at its best, even if it doesn't run flawlessly.

    Jordan Ramée
   on November 9, 2020 at 3:01AM PSTAssassin's Creed Valhalla fully embraces the series' heritage. The 12th major Assassin's Creed game shows a keen awareness of the history and gameplay innovations of the saga, and it feels like a love letter to the franchise as a whole. This makes the game a far more rewarding experience for longtime fans, though newcomers can still enjoy Valhalla's combat, emphasis on exploration, and mystery-driven narrative without years of time spent in the Animus.In Valhalla, you once again play as present-day protagonist Layla Hassan, who's still a bit shaken up after the unfortunate events at the end of Assassin's Creed Odyssey's second DLC, The Fate of Atlantis. Understandably ostracized from her old team, she's now partnered with fellow Assassins Shaun Hastings and Rebecca Crane. The trio find themselves facing the daunting task of needing to save the world, and their only clue as to how is a mysterious message of unknown origin that contains coordinates to a grave. With no other leads, Layla hops into the Animus machine with a DNA sample taken from the skeletal remains, allowing her to relive their life in the distant past. This time she'll be Eivor, a Viking who lived during the ninth century.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

However, its modern-day plot is the most focused it has been in years. There's a clear and present danger, and a nice setup for the throughline of the game's campaign: the concept of fate.However, the same care is not extended to Valhalla's secondary main character Layla, whose arc in this game concludes in a way that doesn't feel earned. For a game all about fate and the consequences of trying to break free of it, Layla ends up feeling like a passenger more than the driver of the story. Given the lack of evolution in her character over her multiple appearances, her defining quality has become the bull-headed nature she exhibited in Origins and Odyssey. Thus, her characterization in this game seems all the more contradictory, leaving the modern-day storyline with a bit of an unsatisfying feeling. Thankfully, Layla isn't Assassin's Creed Valhalla's primary main character, and Eivor more than picks up the slack when it comes to story.Eivor is portrayed as female in the Assassin's Creed Valhalla: Song of Glory comic, which feels like a more natural choice for the character, so that's how I played them. However, you can choose to play as a male version instead, or have the Animus choose for you, which changes Eivor's gender at certain points throughout the campaign (and you can switch among all three options whenever you want). A Viking raider, Eivor is a leader of the Raven Clan alongside her adopted brother, Sigurd. At the start of Valhalla, Eivor has a vision that foretells she will meet a terrible fate. Before she can make proper sense of the more minute details of the vision, however, Sigurd decides to leave Norway for England, prompting her to follow. The two reestablish themselves but find their new home is now located at the centerpiece of several wars. Sigurd sets out to ally with each of England's four kingdoms (Wessex, Northumbria, East Anglia, and Mercia) in order to carve out a safe plot of land for the clan, leaving Eivor behind to oversee their growing settlement and only calling on her when he's in need of her strength or cunning intellect to put the final touches into securing a new alliance.Thus, Valhalla's story plays out over a series of self-contained narrative arcs--a first for Assassin's Creed. By talking to Sigurd's wife, Randvi, you can choose which of Sigurd's leads to pursue next, which kicks off a two-to-three-hour story. Upon completion, you return to Randvi to report on what transpired, invest any collected resources into the settlement, and then pick the next narrative thread.This structure works both for and against Valhalla's story. Once an arc is done, it's done--certain characters can come back in later arcs, but that very rarely happens. This opens up Valhalla to several different types of storytelling styles as well as different stories. It's not one large campaign of subsequent events but many events that loosely tie together--it's like Valhalla is divided into dozens of large-scale side quests. To the game's benefit, this means that if a specific narrative arc has characters or gameplay you don't necessarily enjoy--like, oh, I don't know, searching for some annoyingly hard-to-find environmental clues in order to figure out who amongst your group is a traitor--you know that once the arc is over, you're likely never going to have to engage with that pocket of England ever again. The story will soon move past that arc and then largely act like it never existed, giving you new characters to meet and mission structures to engage with. However, this works against the game too, as anything you like won't last either.The biggest detriment of the self-contained arcs is the somewhat shallow supporting cast. Because characters typically only stick around for a few hours, there isn't much time for development. And where there is any, it's rushed. I've seen a stalwart man who stubbornly maintains that the pagan Danes should be forced to believe in God change his tune after a night of drinking with Eivor and being kidnapped. Now, don't get me wrong, I can buy into someone changing who they are, but to see your entire set of morals do a 180 in a matter of hours defies belief. Rapid shifts in perspective and principles like this occur in other places throughout the campaign too, and they're usually just as unbelievable. Romances, especially, suffer for this. Unlike Odyssey's Kassandra/the other guy, Eivor can enter into long-term relationships with certain characters, regularly visiting them for dates and smooches. It's all very shallow, though, and, save for one (which I cannot talk about but holy crap the audacity of it makes it wonderful), they don't have any meaningful impact on Eivor's story.Eivor is the one who bucks the trend for Valhalla's paper-thin characters. We spend nearly 70 hours with her, so she does have a well-written character arc that's allowed to evolve at a believable pace. Eivor's primary motivation is to avoid her fate. Though her actual character is already established--she is a brash warrior and quick to anger, but also loyal to her clan, cunning, and a poet at heart--you get to push and prod at her thoughts and actions. Eivor wants to avoid being remembered as a shameful traitor, and you get to influence how far she's willing to go to ensure that outcome.The decisions you make determine how others--especially Sigurd--view Eivor, which can result in slight alterations to how certain arcs (and the campaign as a whole) end. They're small changes that avoid outright redefining the timeline of real human history, instead focusing on giving you the room to somewhat shape Eivor into your desired protagonist. For example, incorrectly deducing the identity of a traitor in one of the later arcs caused one of my allies to ultimately be shot, seemingly gravely so as I never heard from them again. Your decisions can impact gameplay too; for instance, after sparing one of the early game bosses, the man rewarded me for my kindness by telling me how to prevent Eivor's name from being added to the list of targets that the wandering Zealots hunt. Had I killed him, I would have never learned this information, and the group of some of Valhalla's most dangerous and powerful enemies would have hunted me throughout the rest campaign.Though Eivor is the only character that really benefits from it, this storytelling structure works out for Valhalla. With a main campaign that clocks in at 65 hours, dividing Valhalla into more digestible two-to-three-hour stories helps you get through the whole thing. There are clear stopping points in the campaign, which help pace the story so that it's not immediately jumping between too many high-key set pieces in short succession or going long stretches with nothing happening. Its pacing still isn't without its issues--Valhalla takes way too long to get to the more exciting and intriguing, nuanced arcs. I remember thinking, ""Oh, wow, this game is actually starting to get really freakin' good,"" and then seeing I was already 15 hours in. Once it hits its stride with memorable arcs and more things to do in the settlement, Valhalla starts to exhibit the kind of confidence you'd expect in the third go at the new open-world RPG style of Assassin's Creed, but it just takes a long time to get to that point.Initially limited to a choice of only a couple of alliances to pursue, your options of possible missions quickly balloons after the first 15 hours, with Randvi giving you several points of interest on your map. The game does encourage you down a pretty specific path--you may have four possible alliances to go after but maybe only two are within areas that match your current power level, for example. And the game doesn't give you every possible alliance at once. You're usually given them in batches of two to four, and get a new batch when the current one is complete. There are exceptions--you get some alliances early on that are located in very high power level areas, showcasing missions you should be working towards, not jumping at immediately. But this is more a suggestion than direction. You can go after alliances well above your power level if you want. As far as I can tell, you can go anywhere on the map as soon as you establish your settlement in England, even if the story isn't pointing you in that direction yet. Your attack damage and health will just be lower than what is advised. But even that can be fun. I've gone after a few alliances where Eivor would die in one or two hits from the high level enemies, pushing me to really learn the exact timing needed to dodge and deflect attacks. Regardless of what order you choose, you'll eventually make some sort of alliance with or conquer every part of England before the campaign is done. None of the missions that Randvi brings you are optional--you'll do all of them eventually.Eivor's lasting impact, or the potential for it, is an effective driving force to carry you through to this end. Figuring out how a random Viking from the 800s will save the world in 2020 is an intriguing proposition, especially since Valhalla does such a good job laying breadcrumbs of knowledge and small revelations throughout its runtime to keep you chasing the answer to that question. The game quickly lays out that it's who Eivor is and what she ultimately does that is important, but then deftly sets up several possibilities. Eivor begins to become a respected leader and partner to Randvi in overseeing the settlement, an almost legendary warrior when acting in Sigurd's name and securing alliances, and an Assassin as she hunts for the Order of Ancients (precursors to the Templar Order) alongside the Hidden Ones (precursors to the Assassin Brotherhood). All the while, she tries to piece together the true meaning of her visions alongside Valka, the Raven Clan's seer, who talks Eivor through her emotional and mental turmoil. All of these plotlines mix together to form Valhalla's main campaign, informing Layla (and by extension, us) as to who Eivor is, while providing the clues needed to put together how everything in the franchise adds up. I love that, even once it's shown its entire hand, Valhalla doesn't actually explain everything. It just gives you pieces that are there to put an answer together.There's actually quite a bit of Assassin's Creed Valhalla that isn't explained, and the game is better for it since there's just so much to discover. For example, several characters and notes comment on the Hidden Ones existing in England years prior; you're told the group had six bureaus but that's about it. There are no waypoints and no direction for where to find one. And until you actually stumble upon one, it's not even really clear that you can find them. You know how I've found a few? Deductive reasoning. I opened my map, looked at the places I had visited, and thought like a Hidden One based on my understanding of them from previous games. The group likes to operate near cities of prominence, and since I knew they had last been in England when Rome ruled the country, I looked at cities built in the shadows of Roman ruins--specifically ones that seemed to have small buildings near the outskirts of the city. Within an hour, I found three bureaus. Inside, I discovered pieces of Hidden One armor--my favorite piece that I've found thus far is a cloak that gives Eivor the cool-looking beaked hood that's traditionally worn by the protagonists of the Assassin's Creed games.Valhalla trusted me to think like an explorer, to put myself in Eivor's shoes as she navigates and attempts to understand this new, unfamiliar world. The game's take on ninth-century England feels like an actual world to explore, which is a manageable task since you'll largely be sticking to contained areas for a narrative arc, then moving to a new location for the next one. Valhalla is the first Assassin's Creed game in a while where the main campaign saw me explore nearly the entire space. There are still plenty of pockets I've only sailed by and haven't actually walked through yet, but I finished the campaign feeling I had a solid grasp on the world I had explored. This is still a Ubisoft game that's packed with waypoints to follow for the main campaign and side missions, but in Valhalla, they're also designed to encourage you toward discovery--and the game has such wonderful, heartbreaking, hilarious, and intriguing things to look for. Sometimes, it's merely gameplay items like the aforementioned Hidden One's hood, but it can just as often be something that's technically useless but goes a long way towards filling in the gaps of what's happened in England prior to Eivor's arrival. If I weren't playing through the game for review on a deadline, my final playtime for Valhalla would have been much higher. I wanted to go off the beaten path more often than I had time for.Though Eivor is characterized as a bit of a lone wolf, her journey across England won't always see her travel alone. The easiest way to reach the furthest corners of England is sailing along the country's vast system of rivers and swamps via longship. Valhalla doesn't really do naval combat (you can shoot your bow from the ship to snipe soldiers on the shore); instead, your ship is primarily a means of transportation. It also livens up an otherwise lonely adventure--you can ask your crew to sing or tell stories. There's something so relaxing and peaceful about sailing through the grassy countryside of Mercia or past the ice-covered mountains of Northumbria as your clan of fellow Vikings bellow out a song.As much as I enjoyed discovering what England had to offer, there is one aspect of exploration that is a little grating: puzzles. Valhalla has several types of puzzles, the most common being obstacles that block your path. Sometimes it's a lock that needs a key or a barred door where you need to shoot the plank keeping it shut. And sometimes it's racing around an entire castle for several minutes screaming, ""Where's the f*****g pot?"" in what seems like a tedious search for the one flammable oil jar that you need to pick up and slowly walk to the crumbling wall or floor you have to blow up. This kind of puzzle is a momentum killer--the most deadly assassin of them all.It's in combat that you find the most agency in how you shape Eivor. Earning skill points allows you to invest in the constellation-like skill tree, further buffing Eivor in the Way of the Raven (stealth combat skills), Way of the Bear (melee combat skills), and Way of the Wolf (ranged combat skills). The constellation of lines twist and turn on one another, allowing you to easily double-back and invest in more than one tree, while also having different branches of each tree cross over for more interesting build opportunities. You can respec Eivor's skills at any time for free, allowing you to easily reshape her if one combat style isn't to your liking.Regardless of where you put your skill points, Eivor is a badass raider who dual-wields weapons with a frenzied intensity. Valhalla encourages you to fight aggressively. Eivor doesn't regenerate health, and your healing rations are limited, so it's in your best interest to end fights as quickly as possible by assassinating an opponent or disrupting the tempo of their attacks with powerful strikes, counters, or blocks. Button mashing will deliver you to an early grave; strategically playing to your strengths is the only way to succeed against tougher foes.You can also fight enemies with social stealth, a former core mechanic of the Assassin's Creed franchise that hasn't been seen since 2015's Assassin's Creed Syndicate. When entering cities where Eivor isn't a trusted face, she dons a hood and wraps a cloak around herself. Choosing to drop the hood, sprint, bring out your weapons, climb structures, or do pretty much anything that an average person wouldn't do will draw attention, especially from those who want to kill you. This is used to great effect in some of the more tense story arcs, where Eivor is hunting members of the Order of Ancients in cities that the group or an enemy king controls, forcing her to stick to crowds, parkour across rooftops, utilize drunks to cause a distraction, and blend into the scenery until she can close in on her target and shank them with a hidden blade.However, Eivor's parkour mechanics aren't as good as those seen in some of the previous games (Assassin's Creed Unity still reigns supreme in this regard), so Eivor can feel a bit clunky when trying to stealth. It's frustrating when you accidently jump to your death because Eivor didn't quite snap to the next rooftop, or you are noticed in a crowd because--without a way to force Eivor to walk slowly--you push the thumbstick just a centimeter too much and send Eivor into a suspicious jog. I'm overjoyed to see social stealth return to Assassin's Creed, but since Valhalla's controls sometimes work against you, it occasionally feels like it would be easier to announce yourself and kill everyone in the vicinity instead. And if you want to do that, that's fine--Valhalla does not immediately fail you for being detected.Although the Assassin's Creed franchise will no doubt continue, there is a real sense of finality to Valhalla's main campaign. Valhalla brings together dozens of narrative threads--enough context is provided for newcomers to understand the general gist of what's going on, but even longtime fans may want to refresh themselves on the lore of the previous games to get everything out of Valhalla. It references nearly every mainline game in the franchise to tell you how they all connect, unifying a series that has largely felt separated into two distinct halves: the Desmond-Miles-saves-the-world era and the newer, more directionless one of 2013-2018.There have been so many lingering threads since Desmond's death, and only more have been created with the introduction of the Sages, new Pieces of Eden, the origins of the Assassin Brotherhood and Templar Order, and the now fairly convoluted modern-day storyline. Valhalla resolves all of this in an incredibly satisfying way. It does for the series what Assassin's Creed III did back in 2012: It clears the board while also paving the way for something brand new.Despite its strong connection to past games, Assassin's Creed Valhalla is more than capable of standing on its own. It takes a little while to build momentum, but when it hits its stride, Valhalla is a confident Assassin's Creed title that takes a few narrative risks which, as a whole, pay off. Eivor is a good hero with an identity that drives the mystery behind the main narrative, and she shines in the self-contained arc structure of Valhalla's story. The supporting cast may not shine as brightly, but it's easy to forgive that when exploring England and discovering new nuggets of worldbuilding is so rewarding.Assassin's Creed Valhalla is featured as one of the best PS5 games.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"
Assassin's Creed Valhalla,Nicole Carpenter,Polygon,https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/11/9/21554755/assassins-creed-valhalla-review-xbox-one-ps4-ps5-xbox-series-x-pc,"Filed under:Myth and reality blurred in a world that’s rich with mysteryTo die with an ax in hand is a glorious death, or so the Vikings in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla say. You’ll have that ax with you in the afterlife, on Odin’s great hall and on the fields of an everlasting battle. So much of pop-culture Viking history centers around battles and raiding, and so does Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, but as the title suggests, the more important part is in what comes after, the mythology of death.This is also a complex saga of friendship, honor, and gods that the Norse people believed in. These are what life in Valhalla is ruled by, all at once by ax and by fate. It’s a world largely seen through the eyes of Eivor, a stoic Norse warrior (or drengr, as the Vikings would say), who acts as the protagonist in Ubisoft’s latest historical, open-world game. Valhalla is a long, sprawling saga of a game, one that blends myth and reality in a world that’s rich with mystery.The backdrop to Eivor’s personal complexities is the Viking expansion into England, as she and her brother break off from their father’s rule to invest in a new land. This, of course, is where a lot of the killing comes in; the expansion into England is complicated by a largely intolerant group of Anglo-Saxons that controls much of the area. But this area of England, now called Raventhorpe, is also a lush world of wildlife, stunning scenery, and a growing community knotted by complicated relationships.Eivor’s story begins with an early memory: At a celebration with her family and another Viking clan in Norway, Eivor’s father Varin asks her to present a gift to King Styrbjörn, a symbol of allyships between their separate clans. It’s at this time that another clan, led by Kjotve the Cruel, attacks. The battle ensues before Kjotve offers Varin a second option: for Varin to give his life so the rest of the clan could live. Eivor’s mother, Rosta, protests, willing Varin to fight, but he chooses to die — and Kjotve kills them both, and the battle continues.Polygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences.

Her father’s choice is deemed a cowardly move by many, including Eivor; other characters continually insist that her father died without honor. As if it were a betrayal. It’s after this point that the player is asked to choose who to play, before the animus glitches out and Eivor and Sigurd (now her brother by adoption) return as adults journeying off to England with a new, mysterious friend who is part of a hidden order.Like Assassin’s Creed Odyssey before it, Valhalla lets the player choose between a male or female character, but there’s a third option: Let the Animus choose. Whatever you choose, you’ll play as Eivor — just with changes in how she’s presented and the pronouns used. I chose the female Eivor, though letting the Animus choose is a weird option, where the game will decide at different points to switch between the two versions. This happens for mysterious reasons that are explained by the modern-world framing device, which is a confusing storyline about how modern-day people access historical memories from people of the past. It’s a spinoff of the larger story that’s present throughout the franchise’s history, a battle between Templars and Assassins — two powerful organizations that control large parts of the world — both of which have different visions of how the world should work. To me, the modern-day framing is confusing and I like to ignore it. Moving between those two worlds has always been jarring, so there was no way I was going to let any part of that — the Animus — chose my character for me.

  Ubisoft has said that both genders are considered “canon” for the game, because of the choice option. But because there is really no difference between the options — aside from looks and voice — it feels hollow, especially given reports of how female Assassin’s Creed characters have routinely been sidelined as main protagonists. The perception from Ubisoft’s executives in the past, according to a Bloomberg report, was that “female protagonists wouldn’t sell” — something indicative of a larger sexist culture at the company. It’s worth noting, too, that Valhalla’s development occurred during a tumultuous time for the global company, as dozens of people have accused staff members at Ubisoft, including some of its high-profile employees, of sexual misconduct and sexual assault, including accusations against former Valhalla creative director Ashraf Ismail. In June, Ubisoft began an internal investigation into allegations of deceptive infidelity on the part of Ismail, and in August, Ismail was fired.It’s impossible for me to play this video game, let alone review it, without considering the environment and company culture at Ubisoft, especially given how Ubisoft has apparently perceived its female characters, a perception that goes back far into the franchise’s history. For instance, in 2014, former Ubisoft creative director Alex Amancio notoriously told Polygon that an Assassin’s Creed game couldn’t have a playable female assassin because “it was really a lot of extra production work.” And so when I think about Valhalla and its character options, I wonder how much of this “both genders are canon” thing plays into the history of women in Assassin’s Creed.It feels complicated to grapple with, especially since I love how Eivor is portrayed in Valhalla. The way she struggles with her family history and her own destiny is fascinating, and her relationships mirror that complexity. She’s contemplative, cunning, and viciously defends her clans; she’s a true drengr. And that’s interesting in itself, because drengr is a gendered term, typically used to describe a “bold, valiant, worthy man,” according to Richard Cleasby and Gudbrand Vigfusson’s An Icelandic-English Dictionary.I like that this title is applied to her throughout the story without care for gender. It presents her not as an “exceptional” female character, but an exceptional character — almost an idyllic world where sexism is not as ingrained as it is in ours. Even as much as I like this characterization of Eivor’s power, I wonder if it’s less of a statement and more a result of the gender option, and how the story doesn’t change between the two.Either way, I like Eivor — especially because her role is one that’s rooted, too, in actual history. Some scholars of early northern European history suggest that, in this culture, gender was seen as more complex than the male/female binary: “Is this a culture in which ‘sex’ per se is irrelevant and ‘gender’ is everything?” medieval studies scholar Carol J. Clover asked in Regardless of Sex: Men, Women, and Power in Early Northern Europe. “Or is it a culture that simply does not make a clear distinction but holds what we imagine to be two as one and the same thing?”Valhalla is securely a role-playing game with a stealth influence, instead of the other way around. It allows the player to enact both large-scale battles and quick assassinations while hidden within a crowd. The Vikings, too, introduce their own expression of stealth in their raids, where narrow longships sneak up to encampments to attack without warning. Eivor has an assassin’s blade, a gift given to her from Sigurd. Hers, though, is not hidden — she wears it atop her cloak, because she wants her foes to see their fates in her weapon.And oh, the foes she has. Though some Danes, as the Saxons call them, live in peace with the Saxons, there’s a lot of turmoil, and the core gameplay loop of Valhalla has Eivor “pacifying” different regions in England. Each of these different regions is presented as its own little saga, a contained package of storylines that (sometimes) end with an allyship in hand.These quests are quite varied, with a bunch of different activities to partake in. Combat design allows the player to choose a methodology in their attack. For instance, I’m more of a brute-force kind of player, one who always announces a raid before bursting through a monastery’s doors. Stealth plays a role occasionally and when necessary, but most of the time, the game lets me play how I prefer: I’d rather cause chaos and deal with it than spend time planning out an attack. The beauty of it is that there are options, as is natural with an open-world game like this.Most of the time, quests involve doing a favor for someone in charge of any given region — whether that’s driving off Saxon invaders or releasing captured fighters. It sometimes means helping people that Eivor doesn’t quite like, a sacrifice in gaining security for the Raven Clan. There are choices to be made throughout these different regions, and though the regions are like contained sagas, the choices do overlap.Valhalla isn’t a game that presents a particularly nuanced system for choices, though. This is still a case of whether you want to be a dick or be nice. (Eivor’s choices always feel like they’re guided by a sense of honor, whether that’s good or bad.) I found, though, that sometimes the simplest decisions made me feel most conflicted, like whether I should let a shitty dude hold his ax while he’s dying.Completing these objectives is how the storyline moves forward, but it’s also a way for Eivor to earn skill points and level up. With each power level, new parts of Valhalla’s ridiculous skill tree open up. Frankly, the full tree is overwhelming, and I started out just by clicking random things because I simply couldn’t make a choice. The good news is that once I got used to the game and its systems, I felt more confident going back and wiping my skill tree clean to tailor it more to my play style. Because the world is open, there’s essentially nothing stopping me from heading to an endgame-leveled region and trying to take something on. Will I succeed? Absolutely not. But can I try? Valhalla lets me.Like Polygon’s Simone de Rochefort wrote in her Valhalla preview earlier in the year, the Assassin’s Creed franchise has been tangled up with religion since the beginning. But more recently, Assassin’s Creed Origins and Assassin’s Creed Odyssey have started incorporating myth and more varied ancient beliefs into the story. Myth is once again central to Valhalla, and myth and reality in the game are closely intertwined. So much so that the boundary between them barely exists.Odin, Frejya, and Valhalla are just as real to Eivor as is God to the monks whose monasteries the Vikings ransack. You can see this throughout the world, whether it’s in the otherworldly quests or the more mundane ones.One of my favorite regions was one in which Eivor joined a community celebrating Samhain, a Pagan harvest’s end festival that likely influenced our modern conception of Halloween. Residents of a large settlement that’s split in the middle by a small river have decorated it all with turnips and lanterns. They give Eivor a costume to wear, the traditional Mari Lwyd costume with an animal’s skull, and tell her to knock on doors reciting poems for treats. It’s a night of mischief and celebration, which is a nice break from the violence of Viking life. (Of course, that all changes come the next morning.)

  There’s a real joy in watching this stoic, serious woman gallop around town like a kid would — incessantly giddy about what she’s collected. Despite how frankly goofy it is, it humanizes Eivor and fleshes out the world she lives in.The Samhain festival is more grounded than some of the other mythological questlines, where the boundaries between the worlds of humans and of gods are more complicated than in previous games in the series. Though the gameplay in Valhalla certainly feels familiar, the aggressive blur between reality and fantasy is a fascinating exploration of Norse mythology and belief. It’s something that’s always felt present in the franchise, but it’s more fully realized in Valhalla. In some ways, I wish Valhalla focused more on the mythology and belief systems at play in the game, and less on the “pacification” of England. The Norse community becoming enmeshed into English land is a key part to the story of the Viking expansion of England — which makes it a key part of the story for Eivor and her brother Sigurd. But that’s at the expense of pushing away the narrative of Eivor and Sigurd’s weird relationship to themselves and to myth, in favor of conquering castles and ruins. I understand the desire to make an open-world game, one that’s long and immersive and in a world that feels like you could live in it forever. I like that there’s a lot to do. But there were large swaths of time where I simply forgot about Sigurd and my clan as I went off in search of monasteries to raid for silver.Valhalla’s most intriguing story is one about faith, honor, and family, but it’s buried inside this massive, massive world stuffed with combat and side quests. That balance is not always ideal, but I’m glad, at least, that it forces me to spend more time seeking out interesting things in the game’s world.

Assassin's Creed Valhalla,Zack Zwiezen,Kotaku,https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-valhalla-the-kotaku-review-1845615415,"Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla, a huge game made during a pandemic and with its own studio and parent company in crisis, is a game trying to do some difficult things. The first Assassin’s Creed in two years, and the 12th major Assassin’s Creed overall, it is the work of creators who are trying to honor the franchise’s past while charting its future. They’ve tried to change the formula for open-world games overall. And they’ve taken a stab at portraying the dubious morality of Viking conquest. What’s shocking is that Valhalla nearly always succeeds at these things, creating an impressive game that stands above many other contemporary open-world adventures. Like the previous Assassin’s Creeds, Valhalla is a third-person open-world adventure featuring stealth action and lots of murder. And like those games, it features two storylines. One is set in the modern-day, including characters and narrative elements that have been around since the 2007 original. That story of Assassins fighting Templars involves ancient pre-human civilizations, secret wars between shadowy groups, and powerful artifacts of old. The other storyline—the one you spend 95% of the game playing—is set around 875 AD, when Vikings and their clans left Norway and explored and conquered parts of England and Europe.In the modern day, you play as Layla Hassan, a researcher introduced in 2017’s Assassin’s Creed Origins who continued to star in the modern day sequences in 2018’s Assassin’s Creed Odyssey. Layla and her crew of Assassins are trying to stop the world from ending, and they’ve traveled to the final resting spot of a special Viking named Eivor. They believe that this Viking and his or her past may hold the secret to saving the modern world from disaster. To experience Eivor’s history and story, Layla enters the Animus, a device that allows people to re-live the lives of people from the past, using their DNA memories... or something. It’s just magic science mumbo-jumbo, don’t think about it too much.Once in the Animus, you take on the role of Eivor, a Viking warrior whose parents were killed when they were young. . Eivor is raised by Styrbjorn, the clan’s king and essentially becomes siblings with the king’s son, Sigurd.Players can choose to control a male Eivor, a female Eivor or take a third option that alternates between the two. I chose the female Eivor and didn’t really think about my choice much after that. Because the game is written to support those genders, it’s never featured in any quests or dialogue. It means Eivor is treated the same, man or woman, which is nice but also feels like a missed opportunity.The game begins in Norway, where players first lead Eivor in a quest for revenge. Soon, the game is about politics. Eivor and Sigurd become fed up with the king and his decisions about how to rule. They recruit their friends to join them in departing Norway and sailing to England. Once in England, Eivor’s mission is to help her clan build a thriving settlement in a new world, while exploring and fighting to create allies across all of England.This setup gives all of Valhalla a compelling, consistent sense of purpose and momentum. In not only the main narrative, but also the gameplay and progression. It gives Valhalla more structure than previous Assassin’s Creed games, which sometimes meandered for hours before finding the plot again. In Valhalla, nearly everything you do feeds into this narrative of exploring, conquering and building allies with other kingdoms.For those who haven’t played the previous games, Valhalla should be easy to follow. While there are references to other games, the bulk of Eivor’s story is separate from the series’ meta-narrative. Only the end of the game, which I won’t spoil here, seems to expect knowledge of the franchise’s modern-day storylines, with so many cross-references that even a longtime fan like me was checking a wiki to sort it all out.“A Viking’s Life For Me” Open-world-action-RPG-stab-a-thonThe world, the narrative structure, big battles, gorgeous vistasSome wonky stealth gameplay, handling of Viking historyUbisoft MontrealNovember 10PS4 (played), PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Stadia66 hoursValhalla’s biggest and most interesting addition to the Assassin’s Creed formula are its Kingdoms. These are large sections of the map ruled by various kings, lords, bishops and noblemen. As Eivor, you decide which of these kingdoms to focus on. You spend a few hours talking to people there, figuring out how you can forge an alliance with this kingdom. Sometimes it involves working with the king in charge. Other times, you’ll be tasked with overthrowing a monarchy or helping a young king learn how to lead and survive his enemies. Each kingdom took me two to four hours to complete and felt like a season of a TV show. Kingdoms are separate from the main overarching plot of Valhalla, which involves Assassins, relics, secrets and powerful enemies hiding in the shadows. But they still move Eivor and your clan’s story forward. And like a good TV show, these seasons regularly end with a narrative climax that feels satisfying.These kingdoms are where the game tries to balance who Vikings were and how brutal they could be as they invaded foreign lands. Players spend a lot of time in this game working with local communities and towns, helping them and learning from them. But you also spend a good amount of time raiding churches and fighting wars against locals and invaders. Eivor seems to understand that what is happening isn’t always fair or nice to the English who call this land home. She comments directly about this and at times shows remorse. However, she never stops expanding her clan and raiding. Ultimately, Valhalla tilts its sympathies toward the Norse fighters. They show them as courageous, but bloodthirsty warriors and invaders who are willing to burn a church down for silver. Yet they also show the compassionate side of them and emphasize many Vikings’ desire for a new life, free from oppressive kings and never-ending war. Of course, they ended up in England, a land filled with oppressive kings and never-ending wars. The more things change…While kingdoms and their self-contained quests are the biggest and best change to the Assassin’s Creed gameplay loop, there are other changes that address shortcomings from the formula introduced with the franchise-changing Origins and its successor, Odyssey. While those games were big, open, and felt better to play, a lot of repeated side activities and quests also made them at times monotonous and repetitive.Valhalla strips some things down and rearranges others. Side quests are very different. Gone, for the most part, are the lengthy sidequests of Origins and Odyssey that could take players on a multi-step journey through a large section of the game’s world. Instead, the map in Valhalla is filled with smaller, quicker, and more varied activities and quests to do and see. Sure, there are still random people to help out there, but their problems are often smaller and don’t involve trekking around the map. For example, on a mountainside in Norway, I found a Viking who was sleepwalking and needed me to help him back to his camp. In England, I stumbled upon some nuns who were trying to escape the country and who needed protection. One of my favorite encounters involved a Viking couple who felt their relationship was dull and boring. So they asked me to break things and start a fire in their home so they could feel the passion again, like when they were younger and fought in battles side by side. (Spoilers: It worked.)These encounters don’t clog up your quest journal. You find them by exploring down glowing dots on your map. What you find usually only takes a few minutes and sticks to one small area of the world, like a house, a tree, a camp or a river. Because of this, I felt compelled to finish them whenever I happened to find one in the world.In other open-world games, I would find myself avoiding some side content because it was just more hours of busywork. But in Valhalla these tiny encounters kept me playing long past my bedtime, and not because I wanted some new weapon or gear, but just because I wanted to see what new mini-story I was about to encounter.Valhalla also deviates from some of the tedious aspects of Origins and Odyssey with its streamlined loot system. While you do find new gear and weapons in the game, it’s much more limited. You won’t be collecting thousands of bows and helmets just to sell them. Instead, there is a set amount of gear and weapons in the world, and once you find them you won’t find them again. They don’t just drop off enemies, either. Instead, they are always found at the end of quests or in specifically marked spots on the map, often involving the completion of an environmental puzzle. The key benefit of this change is you won’t spend dozens of hours fiddling with inventory management, allowing you to focus on gear you like and level it up using materials you find in the world.Don’t be mistaken, this is a big Ubisoft game, so there is still a lot of content in the world for you to find and complete. It’s just more varied and interesting. Gone are the thousands of enemy bases and treasure chests seen in Odyssey. Instead, you have strange puzzles to solve, cursed lands to cure, and small stories to experience. The overall effect of this is that I found myself losing hours of playtime just exploring the world, curious what new thing I might find or puzzle I might discover over the next hill. It’s very easy to spend hours and hours in this game before you even realize it, and rarely did it feel like a grind.While many fans enjoyed the previous games, some, including myself, felt the franchise was forgetting its origins and disliked that it had become less focused on stealth and assassinations. Valhalla isn’t a full return to the more classic stealth-focused Assassin’s Creed games, but it’s clear the developers wanted to bring back some of that classic action in this new game.So, pretty quickly into Valhalla, you receive a hidden blade from a pair of Hidden Ones (a.k.a. Assassins before they called themselves that). Eivor herself isn’t an Assassin, but she does learn a few tactics from these two Assassins, including how to use the blade and how to blend in to hide in plain sight. The main tool for doing this is a hood, which players can equip when they enter cities where Vikings aren’t welcome. With this hood, you can carefully walk by enemies without them noticing you, blend in with crowds, or chill on a bench with a random civilian. These are all stealth options that have appeared in previous games, and it’s nice to see them return in Valhalla, even if it doesn’t always work. Sometimes I thought I was safe to kill someone and then the whole town was still alerted to me. Other times I would try to assassinate someone, but the game would bug out and I would be left exposed in the middle of a large crowd of angry guards. This kind of jank has always existed in Assassin’s Creed games, so if you were able to put up with it before, you should be fine. But it is worth mentioning that these issues—and issues with climbing up walls or missing jumps—are still present. They’re series staples, too, I guess.Another returning feature in Valhalla is the ability to grow and improve your own personal settlement. This works similarly to the Villa in Assassin’s Creed II and your homestead in Assassin’s Creed III At the start of the game, the settlement is nothing more than a few tents and an old longhouse on a hill filled with bandits. As you build it up, new characters start to appear and some of them have their own stories and quests you can complete if you want to learn more about your clan. Additionally, you can unlock new features, like the ability to help the Hidden Ones take down targets, a way to customize your longship, or the ability to catch and sell fish. Most of this stuff isn’t vital to finishing the game, but it does help make your clan and their home feel more alive and personal. I built that tattoo shop. I helped create that farm. And when bad things would happen to my home or the people who lived there, I felt more invested in helping make things right or getting revenge.The main way you build up your settlement is by completing raids. Raiding in Valhalla is all about you and your clanmates attacking and pillaging large monasteries that can be found all over the map. Each monastery has treasure and resources to plunder, though you’ll have to fight through large groups of enemies to reach it, and you’ll need help from your fellow Vikings. These raids, while fun, are another example of Ubisoft trying to walk the tightrope between portraying Vikings as invaders and settlers. For example, the game doesn’t force you to be hostile. You can actually just walk around these monasteries while wearing your hood and avoiding guards. And if you do decide to blow your Viking attack horn to start a raid, you can’t freely kill monks or innocent people who are running for their lives. Doing so will cause you to fail the raid. Even if you spare the innocents and only attack churches, you are still burning homes and churches to the ground and stealing their stuff. The main excuse the game provides is that the monasteries are run by corrupt bastards. It’s historically accurate that Vikings raided, but for those not comfortable living out the fantasy of being a colonizing invader, raids will most likely leave a sour taste in your mouth. For me, it left me with mixed feelings about Eivor and her clan. I still liked them and cared about what happened to them, but I couldn’t shake this nagging feeling in the back of my mind while they laughed and cried, that they also murdered and pillaged.After over 60+ hours of playing Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla, I was surprised by how well it was able to innovate while bringing back classic elements, like social stealth and settlement development. I wish there was a bit more sneaky-sneaky action here, but was glad to at least see an increase from recent games. Valhalla also does a good job portraying the Vikings as deadly invaders and lost settlers looking for a new life.The changes Valhalla brings to the franchise feel as great as a warm hearthfire during a cold winter night. The game’s developers have crafted a world that is wonderful to explore, that soaked up hours and hours of my day before I noticed It. The changes to how the game handles loot and questing, for example, make it a nicer experience to play. Overall, it feels a lot of care and thought went into making Valhalla feel less like a checklist of things to do and more like a world to organically experience.This might not be what longtime fans who miss the more stealth-oriented games wanted, but for those looking for a big, open-world that isn’t boring, there aren’t much better than Valhalla. "
Assassin's Creed Valhalla,Reid McCarter,USgamer,https://www.usgamer.net/articles/assassins-creed-valhalla-review,"A fantastic historical setting is once again weighed down by all the cruft we've come to associate with Assassin's Creed.This article first appeared on USgamer, a partner publication of VG247. Some content, such as this article, has been migrated to VG247 for posterity after USgamer's closure - but it has not been edited or further vetted by the VG247 team.Partway through Assassin's Creed Valhalla, the game's Norwegian protagonist, Eivor, stands over a wounded English opponent. The man has been betrayed by his king, a leader with slippery morals who was willing to sell out his most loyal follower in the hopes of grasping for the power he's in the process of losing to the Vikings occupying his kingdom. Eivor is given a choice: tell her enemy that he's been betrayed by his lord and allow him to live with that awful knowledge, or strike him dead so his last thoughts are that he met his end in service to a leader who valued him as much as he valued his patronage.While a familiar enough kind of binary, Eivor's decision is inflected with the cultural struggles of the era Valhalla hopes to capture: kill the man and he dies a warrior's death, soon to be fighting and feasting in Valhalla until Ragnarök comes; spare him, and he's given a different kind of mercy, born again to live a life that will no doubt be filled with struggles. Glory or mercy; pagan or Christian salvation—whatever choice Eivor thinks is right reflects a cultural and spiritual outlook that will always be at odds with its alternative.In scenes like this, Valhalla is at its best. It portrays a nuanced understanding of what we can imagine might have occupied the minds of a character like Eivor during the tumultuous end of the ninth century, at the height of the Scandinavian Viking Age. After leaving her home in Norway due to the drastic changes in life brought about by King Harald Finehair's unification of the burgeoning nation, Eivor and her foster brother Sigurd arrive in an England wracked with the disorder of the Viking Great Heathen Army's invasion less than a decade earlier. With the Scandinavian colonists having firmly established themselves by the time Valhalla opens, Eivor arrives in an England whose competing Anglo-Saxon kingdoms are largely conquered and in general disarray.She and Sigurd lead their followers to an abandoned camp, begin making contact with other Vikings as well as pliable Anglo-Saxon leaders, and the shape of how Valhalla plays out starts to become clear. From her camp's great hall, Eivor can survey a map of England and find regions (marked by a suggested ""power level"" analogous to her own experience level) where locals need her support to solve a problem. Selecting one of these locations kicks off a chain of missions, called, in proper Viking fashion, ""Sagas"" that basically function as a short story contained within the overarching narrative. Eivor heads to the region and, like the two most recent, RPG-flavored Assassin's Creeds, Odyssey and Origins, ends up fighting enemies, investigating areas filled with books and bloodstains that glow green with a click of the right thumb stick, and running back and forth a whole bunch to talk to various characters.  Between essential tasks, she can climb fortress turrets, mountains, or church steeples to make treasure locations and side-stories pop up on the map, which quickly cover the formerly blank space like a rash. From here, as in the past, Eivor can find places to hunt wildlife for equipment-upgrading materials, search for new weapons or armor, and complete brief tasks provided by ancillary characters. All of this will be immediately familiar to anyone who played Odyssey or Origins. Despite minor tweaks to the series' equipment system, which is thankfully scaled down from the loot deluge of its predecessors, as well as the combat and exploration—Eivor can now blend in with crowds, as in older Assassin's Creed games, though enemies detect her quickly enough that it's only occasionally useful—everything is very much the same as it was in the last two entries to the series. In keeping with bringing back some of the older mechanics, Valhalla's role-playing focus is lessened, too. A saga set in Wessex may show a skill level number far above the player's own, but this doesn't mean that the area is off limits until Eivor has leveled up enough. While Valhalla doesn't do a great job of explicitly explaining this, even the ""highest level"" parts of the map can be accessed when Eivor's own level is far lower. The enemies are simply tougher in these cases, as if a built-in difficulty slider has been increased a notch temporarily. But though these kinds of changes may seem like substantial ones, they ultimately do little to make Valhalla feel like a real departure from Assassin's Creed Odyssey or Assasin's Creed Origins. Instead, they mostly cut out a bit of the time-wasting level grind and equipment swapping that existed before, streamlining the old style of design by snipping away some of its fluff.  It's not all a retread, though. New to Assasin's Creed Valhalla are flyting competitions—poetic exchanges of insults that, in practice, only require the player to recognize basic rhymes and meters in a list of options. Eivor can also play a (pretty good) dice game, competitively drink horns of mead, and funnel resources gathered by pillaging locations throughout England into the building of a settlement, wherein she can change her hair and tattoos, upgrade equipment, host stat-boosting feasts, and get up to other kinds of busywork, essential or not. Most importantly, Eivor can also raid monasteries and abbeys by guiding a crew of warriors along a network of English rivers in her longship.Raiding in Valhalla is as thrilling (and vaguely horrifying) as it sounds. It involves Eivor and maybe a half dozen warriors storming a location defended by varying numbers of Anglo-Saxon soldiers as bells ring, guttural basso profundo singing plays on the soundtrack, and hapless priests, nuns, and peasants try to flee their homes. Ornate chests containing church relics or other valuables can be pushed open by Eivor and another Viking. They knock through barred doors and carelessly shove the lids off reliquaries, leaving corpses twisted under stained glass windows and flames roaring atop the wattle and daub roofs of sacred and secular buildings.These raids eventually become predictable and rote with repetition, but for a time they accentuate the horrific brutality and cultural ruthlessness that characterized so much of the Middle Ages. In them, the mystery and mutual suspicion of people of drastically different understandings of the world erupts into bloody violence. Elsewhere, Valhalla achieves a more subdued, but eerie sense of alienation in Eivor's travels across a gorgeously rendered vision of ninth-century England. The rolling sunlit hills, lush green valleys, and wide fields bursting with harvest-ready crops capture the natural beauty of the British Isles, while ancient, pre-Saxon monuments, northern mountain ranges thick with snow, and gloomy primeval forests are appropriately haunted and foreboding.   The characters Eivor meets on her travels, for their part, alternate between welcoming and threatening. Eivor is a flat character—at least when played as a woman; Valhalla allows players to choose between a female or male Eivor during its introduction. She's a raspy-voiced blank slate, interested only in doggedly pursuing whatever task's laid out for her. Her personality isn't defined by much other than that bland kind of video game morality that's divorced of any discernible ideology other than a righteous anger at the evils of her enemies. In comparison with Origin's Bayek or Odyssey's Kassandra—the latter of whom is so well-written that she single-handedly makes up for an otherwise meandering plot—Eivor is a remarkably bland lead.Luckily, she's surrounded by an exceptional cast. Valhalla's England is populated by important historic figures, like Alfred the Great, King of Wessex and eventual King of Anglo-Saxon England, and Guthrum, the Viking leader who signed an agreement with Alfred that established the Danelaw region while introducing (largely) peaceful relations between Viking and Anglo-Saxon. It also presents a distinctly human version of characters whose stories are often shrouded in the myth-making of the Scandinavian saga-writers. Ivar the Boneless and his brothers, Ubba and Halfdan, children of the half-legendary Ragnar Lodbrok, are brought down to earth in Valhalla's story as realistically mortal military commanders and politicians. Aside from them, the memorable personalities of the bit players who feature in the game's many ""sagas,"" enliven stories of perilous diplomacy, cultural uncertainty, and war. Christian and pagan traditions—whether Norse, Celtic, or otherwise—butt up against one another again and again, animated by characters whose hopes for the future of the Isles is influenced as much by their spiritual beliefs as material desires.  As with most everything in Valhalla, though, the game's self-imposed Assassin's Creed trappings hamper these successes. The saga structure is a smart way to define the sprawling narrative through discrete chapters, but even with it lending shape to the story, Valhalla is simply far too long, overstuffed, and burdened by the series' legacy. More than a few of the sagas feel like side missions that have been extended a bit too far, their inciting incidents and narrative arcs repeating plot points about cultural suspicion, power struggles, and struggles between old and new religions that have already been made elsewhere.The game hardly benefits from their inclusion, either. A non-thorough playthrough took a bit less than 60 hours—a length felt most when extraneous segments gave the impression that the game was about to conclude two or three times before it decided to wrap up (or, more rudely, fizzle out) for real. I should note here, too, that Valhalla crashed to the home screen on an Xbox One S twice during review and several times corrupted save files, leading to one or two hours of lost progress. These problems haven't recurred since a pre-release patch, but it's hard to say whether that means they've been fixed completely. Thankfully, aside from the occasional sludgy camera movement in bigger cities and during larger battles, the game looks remarkably good on an older console and runs well enough for those not in a hurry to buy a new system. Beyond all that, Valhalla sags for the same reason as so many other Assassin's Creed games: it's too long and there's too much cruft in it. The sense of place established by the beautiful landscapes and soundtrack are interrupted by the appearance of glowing mini-map icons on the top of the screen indicating a nearby treasure or side-mission characters yelling their same request for Eivor's help on loop. They render the world utilitarian and, if completed in the midst of a story segment, temper the urgency and mess with the pace of the plot at hand.This has been a consistent problem in Assassin's Creed since its second entry. Each stunningly detailed historical diorama entices players with the promise of exploring the past before cluttering these depictions with far too many distractions. The series gives audiences explorable recreations of 18th-century Paris, 16th-century Constantinople, and vast swathes of Ptolemaic Egypt, but, as if worried that coupling these locations with an engaging story isn't enough, cover each location with the open world game equivalent of really persistent carnival barkers. Rather than rethink this style of design, Odyssey, the most recent Assassin's Creed, indulged it even further. Its ancient Greece was lousy with side activities, and its story was told at a loose, lazy pace that, despite its strengths, suffered too often just from going on far longer than it needed to. Valhalla, with its generally strong saga stories and exceptionally realized landscape, suffers from this issue more than most simply because what's being tampered with would obviously be so much stronger without distractions.Worse, the larger fiction of the Assassin's Creed series, with its Templars and Assassins, Isu civilization, and unremarkable 21st century cast, pops up time and time again to interrupt the far more interesting historical plot. These elements all feel like barnacles on the game's plot and design; vestigial concepts whose removal from the series are long overdue, and nowhere is it clearer how much they drag the series' historical fiction down than in entries like Valhalla, which otherwise succeed so well.So many of the game's characters struggle with how to live (and think) in an era of vast political and cultural upheaval. They see the future as a frightening void that could end up pagan or Christian, Viking or Anglo-Saxon, filled with opportunity or made miserable by scarcity and persecution. These ninth-century characters mainly end up doing best when they embrace the uncertainty of their moment in time, focus on the basic human values that matter most to them, and hold onto those decisions as they head forward into the chaos of a world in flux. If Valhalla took the lessons it so often teaches through its story and was similarly flexible in design, it would be a much better game for it, whether it needed the Assassin's Creed surtitle slapped in front of its name or not.
ConclusionAssassin's Creed Valhalla's vision of ninth-century England is a beautiful place to explore, populated with a great cast of characters who make up for the bland new protagonist, Eivor. Nevertheless, the tired overarching story of Templars and Assassins, and a design ethos that overstuffs the setting with side activities, add unnecessary bloat and distractions to the experience. Valhalla's a solid action-adventure game that does well to capture the turmoil of its historical era, but it's weighed down by the increasingly ponderous legacy of the series it represents.You're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!

ASSASSIN’S CREED VALHALLA REVIEW FOR PS4, XBOX ONE, PC, PS5, AND XBOX SERIES X.Assassin’s Creed Origins was an origin in more ways than one as it went through the beginnings of the Brotherhood and marked a new start for the series as a whole. Odyssey expanded upon that refresh to a fault and now Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is the third iteration of this modern RPG formula. Vikings may be a promising starting point, but Valhalla is aimless and bloated beyond recognition, making for a dull and par for the Norse installment in the franchise.Ninth century Europe does have its bright spots though. England and Norway are lush in their own ways; the former full of trees and greenery and the latter covered in white frost. HDR does wonders for the game, especially as the sun washes over the landscape or sets in the distance. Brightly colored longships and longhouses also benefit from the same treatment, albeit in a different way as it brings attention to the lovingly created items from Norse culture.Although beauty does not override how uninspired the actual world is. England may be visually appealing but forests and rolling hills grow stale rather quickly as they repeat over and over across the vast landmass. Many, many open-world games — including 2018’s Assassin’s Creed Odyssey — are filled with a similar type of terrain, plainly displaying how unoriginal and tired such open fields are. Valhalla’s fields are even more open and empty than usual, too, because of how few cities decorate its land and offer a chance of pace. The time period explains why this is an unfortunate reality, but that does not excuse it. Norway and Asgard are more unique but are unfortunately such small parts of the game.England does not earn its scale and only wastes the player’s time as they ride back and forth between missions that are similarly mind-numbing. Valhalla, even on its insultingly easy Pathfinder exploration difficulty, asks very little of the player. It leads them by the nose from objective to objective, offering little in the way of actual exploration and discovery. Players are almost never rewarded or encouraged to figure things out or experiment. Almost everything important is marked and incredibly straightforward, keeping the player’s brain a constant, near-vegetative state as they do what the game tells them.Open-world games are slowly starting to embrace creativity and Valhalla’s overbearing grasp on the player and lack of tools is suffocating in comparison. More freeform goals with multiple acceptable paths and a rich, reactive world would be a thoughtful step forward in modernizing the series. Railroading players down one path and not leaving much room for freedom squanders its potential and makes the game feel like it was ripped out of an open-world design document from 2013. Valhalla doesn’t step into the current era and quickly grows stale because of it — a negative aspect that compounds when compared to its two recent and remarkably similar predecessors.While Valhalla doesn’t venture into much new territory, it does at least combine the combat styles of both Origins and Odyssey, utilizing the defensive posture of the former while simultaneously holding the aggressive nature of the latter. Even with the needlessly obfuscated and obtuse skill tree it comes with, the mix of styles creates a solid balance as the stamina-dependent defensive side keeps it from being mashy while the ability wheel adds more options and some much-needed visual flair. Enemies come in multiple shapes and sizes and their varying strategies stave off repetition.Repetition can set in if players find some exploitative killer strategy, which is all too simple. Some abilities and attacks can be linked together and looped in such a way that can repeatedly stagger the most intimidating Vikings and turn them into the shame of their clan. And when effective strategies like that are so easy to find and even easier to abuse, it weakens the entire combat system and all of the options it holds. Delving into the dual-wielding system or wealth of unlockable powers is a hard ask when two axes and the slam can kill nearly everything with ease.Stealth doesn’t even have a bright side and is dramatically downplayed in Valhalla, a sad truth that is symbolized in how protagonist Eivor wields the iconic hidden blade: on their forearm for all to see. Options are too limited (even more so than Odyssey) and thus limit how you can play with the environment and the enemies. And as such, the basics of shooting arrows and waiting in waist-high bushes becomes the all-too-boring norm that has grown monotonous over the years. The new cloak sections attempt to bring back the social stealth from the first game, but they’re also overly restrictive and too slow. Vikings make for lousy assassins and that conceptually makes sense, but the gameplay shouldn’t suffer because of that incongruent comparison.Bad AI puts a hamper on stealth in multiple, sometimes conflicting ways. Enemies bounce between being completely braindead to having the eyes of an eagle and the all-knowing perception of a god. They’ll detect you through walls and across a field with their back turned as often as they’ll fail to see their buddy drop dead right next to them. Friendly AI can be similarly stupid as allies can get hung up on simple tasks like helping you open up a chest or following you down a ladder.Part of this may be due to the game’s shaky technical foundation. While patches are said to be coming, Valhalla is prone to crashing and the occasional glitch. Text can continually reappear, models could have trouble popping in, lips might not sync, and other polish-related issues can give the impression that the game isn’t as complete as it should be; something that is harder to justify given its borrowed foundation. Long loads are in a different category of technical shortcomings, but still drag the game down as it can take multiple minutes to load a save and dozens of seconds to load into a cutscene or vendor menu.Valhalla already asks a lot of the player’s time as it is a ridiculously long game, dwarfing even Odyssey and its elongated hour-count. Length isn’t an inherently damning prospect, but it has to be earned and Valhalla does not come close to earning its 60 to 70 hours for a multitude of reasons.A lot of its follies stem from its storytelling style that focuses on smaller, two-hour side stories over one overarching one. These side stories, or arcs, lack any sort of theme or message and only pantomime drama that it usually doesn’t bother setting up well. Solving an area’s drama yields that area’s trust and while the details change, the relatively low interest level hardly does as most characters, Eivor included, aren’t always the most memorable faces, despite the mostly well-written dialogue. It’s all clinical setup done in such a short amount of time.Most of the arcs are forgettable in a vacuum but even more so once taken in the grand scheme of things as there barely is a grand scheme at all. Eivor heads to England seemingly on a whim to “pacify” the land, create a settlement, and buddy up with the local kingdoms. Racking up alliances has no endgame; it is the endgame. The best RPGs, like the best television shows, know how to make strong, individual narratives in each episode that also contribute to the bigger picture. Valhalla’s lack of a bigger picture further robs these already uninteresting chapters of the meaning since it all feels aimless without something gluing them all together — an issue that gets exponentially worse as the game drags on and on with more and more purposeless side plots.But even Eivor’s loose main goal is troublesome because of how the game glosses over the inherent issues that come with violent expansion. Moving into a new land and killing the natives to grab their property deserves justification or some examination, something the game couldn’t be less interested in doing. Having control over what kind of Viking Eivor is would not only inject some woefully-needed player agency in the narrative, but it would also offer fertile grounds for such commentary. Having to deal with your consequences of your bloodthirsty reign or non-violent methods seems made for an RPG like this.The villages that Eivor and their crew burns down and picks clean are seemingly filled with poor, innocent people that likely don’t deserve such a fate. Eivor is the villain and, in many cases, reasonably so. Even the British soldiers aren’t properly demonized enough to explain away killing them on sight in their country. Such a premise is ripe for examination or critique, but the game just treats it as a fun mechanic that you shouldn’t think too hard about.Assassin’s Creed Valhalla should serve as a learning experience like Assassin’s Creed Unity, the last installment that forced Ubisoft to rethink its approach. Valhalla’s unnecessarily inflated hour count, limited stealth mechanics, disconnected story, and overwhelming sense of familiarity all point to a series once again on the decline because of its inability to focus on its strengths. Obsessing over playtime and Content™ at the cost of innovation and depth puts Valhalla‘s ability to actually get into Valhalla in question, as it doesn’t quite earn the kind of glory that only the best Vikings achieve.Game Revolution reviewed Assassin’s Creed Valhalla on PS4.

Assassin's Creed Valhalla,Brett Makedonski,Destructoid,https://www.destructoid.com/stories/review-assassin-s-creed-valhalla-609154.phtml,"darkAbout 35 hours into Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, I unlocked the “Silent Viking” achievement for killing 10 consecutive enemies without alerting anyone. It really drove home how different this Assassin’s Creed is from all the other Assassin’s Creeds. In previous games, maybe Origins or Odyssey, I would’ve methodically dismantled entire fortresses and earned that same achievement within the first few hours.Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is indiscreet and inelegant. It’s a brash spectacle that’s more interested in glorifying the toils of war than with quietly subduing and destabilizing the enemy. It’s more Viking than assassin, so much that Valhalla feels out of place in the Assassin’s Creed lineage. It’s a wayward-growing branch on the family tree.Assassin’s Creed Odyssey was the Least Assassin’s Creed Game Ever two years ago to great effect. Valhalla strayed too far to its own detriment.Assassin’s Creed Valhalla (PC, PS4, PS5, Stadia, Xbox One [reviewed], Xbox Series X)
Developer: Ubisoft Montreal
Publisher: Ubisoft
Released: November 10, 2020
MSRP: $59.99The Vikings are going to England! After an extended prologue in Norway, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla protagonist Eivor and his/her brother Sigurd take on the Saxons in England. (I played as male Eivor, so, in the name of simplicity, let’s just use he/him pronouns for the rest of the review.) It’s a beautiful land, and the Vikings intend to take every square inch of it.That’s the real impetus for this entire tale. Assassin’s Creed Valhalla trades a compelling plot for all-out conquest. The Vikings are Hel-bent on forcefully annexing the entirety of England, making it their home and taking over the land. The entire game is literally about expansion for the sake of being bigger. In that sense, this is the quintessential Ubisoft game.To that end, each of England’s distinct regions tells its own narrative. Eivor needs to curry favor or overthrow whoever reigns in each area in order to forge a Viking alliance. Assassin’s Creed Valhalla ends up feeling like a collection of mini-stories instead of a grand overarching epic. Certain threads pop up to string the whole thing together, but it’s a largely disjointed plot and usually only serves the immediate cause.It’s a problem because Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is a very large game and it often feels as though there’s nothing irresistible enough to keep pulling you along. It extends beyond the critical path. There’s a tangled web of Templars who need assassinating (exactly like Odyssey‘s Cult of Kosmos) but there’s no fascinating side plot that’ll leave you wondering who’s at the head of it all. There’s a thematic bent toward Norse mythology, but it’s not apparent in the overworld; that stuff seems to be mostly confined to interactions with a single resident at your base camp.The combat — and there is a lot of it — is generally excellent. Valhalla carries over the same combat system from Origins and Odyssey, a straightforward iteration of the From Software-style light-and-heavy stamina-based attacking. It also continues the trend of outfitting the protagonist with a suite of abilities that hinge on an adrenaline meter. It’s good that the fighting is fluid and fun because Ubisoft really quadrupled down on the number of frays you’ll find yourself in.However, Ubisoft also scaled back almost everything else from the way it was represented in Odyssey. Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is much less of an RPG. Eivor doesn’t feel as though he’s given much autonomy over the story’s direction, and the dialogue choice conversations fall short of making an impact more often than not. The gear system has been significantly stripped down, as the equipment Eivor receives is mostly found as semi-major rewards for exploration. In my view, saving us from juggling dozens of not-special piece of gear is nothing short of an improvement.Similarly, the leveling structure has been overhauled. Gone are the days of an overall character level, instead replaced by a total count of the number of skill points earned. Every time you fill the progress bar, Eivor is awarded two skill points to spend on a gigantic sprawling constellation map of perks. It’s mostly minuscule gains to facets of gameplay (health, light attacks, melee resistance, etc.) but there are also abilities mixed among each cluster of skills. It’s a fine enough system, although it usually seemed like I wasn’t speccing toward any sort of build because most of the skill points just went toward increasing the behind-the-scenes numbers a tiny bit.This renewed approach to leveling also means that there’s no real grinding required due to mid-game level gates. The regions of England each have their own suggested power level but that’s a soft gate to discourage tackling something that’s meant for later-game stuff. Through the main campaign and moderate side-questing, you should be properly equipped to keep progressing without any major detours. Ubisoft also learned its lesson from Assassin’s Creed Odyssey and isn’t selling an XP-boosting microtransaction this time. (Although, to be fair, I beat Odyssey without that time-saver and always felt like the controversy was overblown.)Even though I wasn’t especially enamored with the narrative design or the gameplay loop, I still found a lot to like throughout the rolling hills of England. Some of the more interesting parts of Assassin’s Creed Valhalla are hiding among the many encounters in the open world. These world events are little two-minute distractions that tell a quick story. Finding a cat lady, and letting the felines chase away the mice in a field. Helping a man toss all his possessions off a cliff before he stuns you and throws himself off the cliff. Sometimes it’s simpler like going on a magic mushroom trip or destroying a cursed object. These interactions are when Valhalla is comfortable getting weird for a little bit, and they’re among the best this game has to offer.While Assassin’s Creed Valhalla falls into a rote routine, it isn’t without its exclamation-point-worthy “Holy shit” moments. The story crescendos at certain junctures in ways that inject life into this long romp. Odin overseeing a late-game death sequence left me stunned. A mid-game battle atop a cliffside is among my favorite sequences in any Assassin’s Creed.But I also found myself making excuses for Assassin’s Creed Valhalla until I couldn’t any longer. It mimics the Odyssey formula but takes a step backward in almost every way. It sacrifices story for scale. It’s designed to discourage stealth in favor of epic battles. It’s true to the Viking experience, but it isn’t true to the Assassin’s Creed experience. That’s why it comes off feeling like the least essential game in the whole series. Impressive in some of its accomplishments, but inessential all the same.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]AlrightSlightly above average or simply inoffensive. Fans of the genre should enjoy them a bit, but a fair few will be left unfulfilled.

Signup for a Free AccountAlready have an account? Login NowValhalla improves on Odyssey with more focused design, but not all battles are won.There was a time when open-world games often went with the bigger is better mentality. The size of the map was a pre-release selling point. Ubisoft embraced this mentality on several occasions, but quality will always win over quantity and, with Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, Ubisoft dialed back the former and poured more focus into the world and gameplay systems. It was a move that paid off repeatedly in their latest installment of the Assassin’s Creed franchise, but not all Viking warriors go to Valhalla.Assassin’s Creed Valhalla kicks off with players meeting a young version of the main playable character, Eivor, whom they'll get to know better as they experience the game. Eivor is celebrating a Viking alliance with family and friends of the Raven Clan, but after things go south and Eivor’s family is betrayed, the young Viking is attacked by a wolf. This is where players can choose between a male and female Eivor, or if they want Valhalla to decide based on current circumstances at any given time. The decision of whether to play as a female or male Eivor can be changed throughout the experience, which is a nice move by Ubisoft.Fast forward several years and players are in control of Eivor as an adult and must play through a prologue with some tutorial moments scattered in. The first hour showcases Eivor’s Raven Clan life, plus systems like sailing, raiding, gear management and acquisition, the skill tree, and more. The story pushes forward during this time, with Eivor and her adopted brother, Sigurd, seeking revenge on the Viking that betrayed her family years ago. When this business is handled, Eivor, Sigurd, and the Raven Clan set sail for England to build a new settlement for their people.Valhalla really gets going once Eivor arrives in England and the game’s systems start to open up. The clan’s settlement is started, and players must secure resources to build additions and upgrade the living situation for everyone. Just about every part of Valhalla runs through the settlement, which gives it a real sense of home and helps keep all systems connected through this hub. Building Gunnar’s Forge gives Eivor a place to enhance weapons and armor. The Trading Post is a spot to buy or sell items. The Barracks allows for the creation of a Jomsviking and crew management. Customizing the longship can be done in the Shipyard. There’s even a Hunter’s Hut for managing all the Legendary Animals, and a Hidden Ones Bureau to track the Order of the Ancients, a similar system to the cults from Assassin’s Creed Odyssey. There are more buildings, several of which enhance the Feast buff. A Raven Clan Feast will give Eivor some boosted stats when out in the world.The settlement isn’t just about function, though. As new buildings are added the aesthetic changes, giving the vibe of an established community that’s thriving. There’s a sense of accomplishment in building up the settlement, and because it’s connected to so many other aspects of the game, it made me want to get out into the world and swing my axe. Ravensthorpe – my settlement – was a great launching point for my adventures, and it was never far from my mind.Once the settlement was established it was time to head out and gather supplies to build it up further. I hopped in my longboat, asked my crew to sing a song, and enjoyed the peacefulness as we sailed along England’s narrow rivers looking for trouble. In this case, trouble meant a raid, an event in Valhalla where Eivor and her crew can attack a monastery, or several other types of settlements.It’s a lot of fun to raid with a full Viking crew. It provides a unique gameplay experience to attack with a hoard of warriors. If a member of Eivor’s crew falls, they can be revived, and they are needed to help force open doors and chests. Opening chests during a raid is how supplies are acquired to build the settlement. It’s a frantic experience that serves as a reminder that Vikings aren’t often friendly to strangers, although it stops short of encouraging players to kill unarmed priests.Raiding isn’t the only activity, obviously. Most of my time was spent at least toying with the idea of pushing the story forward in Valhalla. I would go where the quests led, but the pull to explore was greater here than it was in Odyssey for me. While the overall narrative in Valhalla was fine, it was never the primary force pushing my decisions on what to do next. The exception to this was a series of quests centered around Eivor's destiny, which I won’t detail in the interest of avoiding spoilers. Generally, though, I was more focused on tracking down collectibles and exploring hidden areas.Valhalla is full of unique places to explore and fun things to do. There are random world events that can be hit or miss. A mini game called Dice or a sort of Viking rap battle known as Flyting are solid distractions. Legendary Animals are there to hunt, Zealots roam the land looking for a fight, and Flying Paper with cosmetic designs floating through the air can be snatched up using Eivor's parkour skills. Many more activities riddle the land and offer meaningful rewards, ensuring players won't get bored in Valhalla. While the main story never really pulled me in, I quite enjoyed some of the characters and nods to Viking lore and Norse mythology. Some quests had me genuinely invested in spending time with the NPCs featured in them, and I think anyone with even a bit of interest in Norse mythology or current Viking pop culture will enjoy Valhalla.The real strength of Valhalla, however, is in the focus that has gone into the world and the systems within it. Valhalla feels much smaller than Odyssey, but there’s less dead space. There’s a good pace to moving around and finding places to explore. It’s a breathtaking game on the highest PC settings – as is expected after Odyssey – and the entire world is enhanced by a beautiful soundtrack that never feels overpowering but always manages to complement the moment perfectly. While I wouldn’t say Valhalla is on the same level as some open-world superstars, it’s a massive upgrade over the hollowness that was felt in Odyssey.As I explored the world, I began to find gear and collectibles, unlocking abilities and skill points to craft my perfect Viking build. Every one of these systems works better in Valhalla than the last few Assassin’s Creed games.There is much less gear in Valhalla than Odyssey, but that gear is far more meaningful. For starters, it all drops near the same base level, but the ability to enhance it and upgrade it is improved. Enhancing gear at a forge can improve its appearance, add slots for runes, and expand its potential to be upgraded. Upgrading gear or adding runes is done from the inventory. What this means is that gear found early in the game can be upgraded and maintained throughout the entire journey, instead of having to replace a weapon every five minutes when picking up a new one.Valhalla has also re-worked how skills and abilities are handled. Abilities, which are generally devastating moves used in battle, are now found by locating a Book of Knowledge in the world, which are often hidden away in caves and behind small puzzles. The skill tree now features both stat nodes and passive fighting moves, but not abilities. Players will now earn skill points in the world and, when spent in the skill tree, will improve their overall power, and allow them to take on more difficult challenges. The skill tree itself is presented as an astronomy map, and never once did I find it tedious to explore or build out my skills. The skill tree's fluidity in use is driven home by that fact that it's free to re-spec Evior’s skills at any time, or even take back single nodes without penalty to spend those points on different upgrades.The gameplay core concerning the skill tree, weapons and armor, abilities, and power feels great. It pushes the player to get into the world and discover what’s on offer, while at the same time allowing for wild build experimentation without punishment. The focus, not unlike in God of War, is on the world and the things to do in it, not on the grind.Unfortunately, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla has it issues, and some are more prominent than others. The big one for me was the game’s performance on PC. According to Ubisoft’s own specs guide, I could easily run the game on Enthusiast, but my experience was riddled with massive frame drops that at times rendered it unplayable. Ubisoft deployed a patch that seemed to have cleared up most – if not all – of the issues, but PC buyers should do their homework before diving in.I wouldn’t call it a weak point, but the combat in Valhalla didn’t do much for me. Dual wielding weapons is cool, as are some fighting moves and abilities, but combat was always just something I had to endure to push the story forward or allow me to explore the area for collectibles and loot. It’s not bad, and even has a few shining moments, but I also wouldn’t say it’s a step forward from Odyssey. The stealth gameplay remains strong and fun, but the nature of Viking warriors means there’s less sneaking and more yelling than previous games.Rounding out my concerns are the instances where I was annoyed by the writing and voice acting. Early in the game I found a world event that was supposed to be funny in a sexual way, but played out as crude and poorly executed. I was also referred to as if I was male on several occasions, even though my Eivor was female. I enjoyed the performance by Cecilie Stenspil as the female Eivor, but some characters from the supporting cast were poorly portrayed. There’s an art to putting humor into games that fit a darker tone, and I don’t think Valhalla pulled it off with consistency here. Most of these issues were scattered about, but when they pop up it can pull a player from their immersion.Assassin’s Creed Valhalla took a lot of great steps with its gameplay systems and fresh focus on a more robust open world. It hooked me on building my perfect Eivor through meaningful gear and by connecting the gameplay loop to character evolution in a fluid manner. The smaller world feels fuller thanks to better pacing and spacing. The plethora of unique and fun things to do while on the path generally tie into the Raven Clan’s settlement, which helps to keep the experience fluid and connected most of the time.It’s a shame that more care wasn’t taken to remove some of the silliness in the writing or to improve on the hit or miss voice acting. The combat doesn't feel like it's taken a step forward and, in fact, combat in Odyssey felt tighter. I'm still worried that the PC performance issues aren't entirely behind me, but I suspect those will get addressed in future updates. Ubisoft is known for their fun open worlds, but it appears that experience and previous stumbles have seen them take big steps forward, making Valhalla one of their best Assassin's Creed games in recent memory.This review is based on a PC digital download code provided by Ubisoft.

					Bill Lavoy posted a new article, Assassin's Creed Valhalla review: Dining with the Gods 
					Good to hear that it's improved but sounds like as always with Assassins Creed games its not perfect. Still looking forward to playing it on Series X hopefully the performance on consoles is a better story.				
					Yea , I’m sure I will still enjoy it. Hopefully my series x ships soon so I can check it out.				
					I went from having to play the game on Medium settings for a full week to being able to get smooth performance on the settings I should. They patched out most, if not all, of the issues. I only had one major performance issue after the patch. I think it'll be perfectly fine on console.				
					Interesting. So the world is better but combat is off a bit. Kinda the reverse of the evolution in Origins and Odyssey...?Will be picking it up for PC and not worried about  the hiccups you had. 				
					The combat is okay, but I found parrying and dodging more satisfying in Odyssey. There are also a lot of battles in Valhalla, so you are sort of forced into combat often. It was fine, but not great for me.				
					I know you picked female actor but did you try the male one, are they both good? 				
					I think it doesn't matter since the game swaps your gender at various points (from one review I read anyway).				
					That is only if you choose that option 				
					I think (and I could be wrong) if you choose the split gender option at the beginning it will change gender at various parts of the game automatically. But if you choose 1 gender at the start of the game, you can switch at any time during the game when you choose.				
					Yeah that's my understanding of how it works as well				
					Briefly, and the actor did a fine job, but I took to the female actor's work quickly and stuck with her.				
					I liked the actress for Kassandra from Odyssey so I was leaning for the female actress again, plus I believe I have some unfulfilled fantasies of being a Viking warrioress from my youth :).				
					Hmmm, so if I was just meh on Odyssey, chances of me liking this are slim 				
					If you aren't into Assassin's Creed games, or at least big into Vikings, there's not much here to change your mind on the series. It's similar to Odyssey in many ways.				
					I wonder, is performance eon XSX better than what I'd see on an 8700k w/ 1080ti?				
					Yes   				
					Not great, not bad. It'd be fine if it didn't hitch constantly. 				
					Are you guys already playing on XSX??				
					Ubisoft+ on PC in Aus.				
					I... Answered in regards to the 1080ti. Sorry.				
					No worries, I know people have been getting shipment confirmations for their XSX's, I was wondering how jelly I should be. Mine is sitting in my costco order history, neither shipped nor charged, in some sort of limbo from which I hope it soon escapes. 				
					The IGN reviewer said its running at 4k and 60 Fps (or almost always) on the XSX.https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-valhalla-review 
					I'm so looking forward to playing an Assassins Creed in 60fps this should make it the best Assassins Creed ever just on that.				
					[deleted]				
					I really wasn't feeling this game, and then I saw this bit from the GB QL about mounts... I gotta have this game. https://youtu.be/TWkAmjzj93s?t=4583 
					Spoilers: You can ride a giant wolf! 
					[deleted]				
					Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu				
					I preferred this part - https://youtu.be/TWkAmjzj93s?t=4889 
					Reviews seem to indicate that it plays great on console and like shit on PC.  Ugh... I'm so glad I spent $700 on a piece of hardware that is about as good as half an XBsX.  Great.  				
					With there now being five Xboxes (OG, S, X, Series S, Series X) with very different speeds, and three Playstation (4, 4 Pro, 5) targets, and an almost infinite number of PC targets, it's going to bog down a system that's already been overtaxed, and add COVID to the whole process.  The game systems all have to ship with a disc that kind of works, where the PC is all digital and they figure their users are used to this bullshit.   That's basically why I buy the consoles. They're less than just a video card, and they seem to have a better out-of-the-box experience.  :P 				
					Welp, XSX it is then... 				
					Also, proper HDR (not through Windows)! 				
					[deleted]				
					Not to rub it in, but the series S is capable of running watch dogs legion at upscale 4k, 30 fps with Ray tracing. Not bad for $300.https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21556197/xbox-series-s-ray-tracing-watch-dogs-legion 
					Yeah I kinda think on console launches you get the best value and best optimization with games from consoles. Don't get PC graphics cards on console launch years, give it a couple years and the PC graphics cards will be twice as quick as the consoles for cheaper anyway. 				
					Ugh, ""Assassin's Creed Valhalla PC performance thread | ResetEra"" https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassins-creed-valhalla-pc-performance-thread.322018/Definitly going XSX				
					Is the Ubi store the only place to buy the game?  Usually GMG might have a pre-order bonus or sale price but they only sell Odyssey apparently... weird.  So... that's the only other place I can think of that sells new digital games.   I should save my money and spend it on more parts for my computer to make it almost as good as a console half the price... 				
					Yeah, looks that way. Even the gray market sites are at full price. 				
					The Epic store has it as well, but I don't see much point buying there.				
					Yeah no. It'll still requite Ubisoft Connect to play it anyway. Also Ubisoft Connect unlocks the game tonight at midnight eastern time (9pm pst) while EGS doesn't unlock till 11am tomorrow. That might not matter to some, but I plan on staying up late tonight! 				
					Unlock time doesn't affect me as I'm still playing WDL, and going slow on it until my new CPU shows up this weekend/next week.				
					Can get 20% off with the ubi points thing if you have any.				
					it says you can't use the 20% for pre-purchases tho =(				
					yeah not only that but you can't use it on new release games which Ubisoft considers to be anything released within a month, I believe. 				
					I totally cashed out my points for a coupon... wonder if I can use it on in game currency to unlock the ... launch day dlc ( /sadface) 				
					Something stupid that I wish multiplatform games would do. In the PC graphics settings I would love there to be a ""PS4/PS5/Xbox/etc"" mode. Mostly just for curiosity sake, but also there are times when I wonder if I should have just bought the game for my PS4 thinking it would have run better haha. 				
					That's not stupid at all, I'd love to have that

Before I go into everything about Assassin's Creed Valhalla—the writing, the action, the open-world jank—I want to offer an unusual preface. Basically: Gosh, I like this game.It's a rare earnest turn for me, especially when I'm talking about open-world Ubisoft games. I try to find a fair-and-balanced way to talk about their hours of gameplay, and I respect the heck out of how their multi-studio teams slam together so many moving parts into a giant, playable romp. But personally, I can get bored with them—same fetch quests, same ho-hum mechanics and checklists, year after year. After playing only a few hours of these games, I feel less like an adventurer and more like an errand boy or girl. None of their high-end rendering or historical references can change that feeling.Yet the Assassin's Creed series has been evolving into AC Valhalla's shape for some time, which we last saw from the character-driven surprise of 2018's AC Odyssey. This year's model is undeniably messy and imperfect, and it doesn't surpass Ghost of Tsushima as my favorite open-world romp so far this year. But it earns my recommendation for getting enough things right—and doing so with more nuance than a phrase like ""a more RPG-like Assassin's Creed"" implies. 









Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla                                                



From $50 at Amazon


From $60 at Epic Games Store

We're now roughly 7,000 games into the series, so if you don't know the basic drill, check any of our older AC reviews. In short: once again, you control a ""chosen one"" warrior in a real-world historical era, as dramatized for the sake of a video game. You're occasionally interrupted by a modern-day plot about researchers who dive into ancient warriors' DNA to wage war against a global, generations-deep conspiracy theory. This offers enough wacky plot hooks for anyone invested in the series. But mostly, you're back in time juggling a mix of open-world traversal, stealthy Spider-man crawls around massive historical sites, and all kinds of murder.In AC Valhalla, this formula lands in 9th-century England, where you're cast as Eivor, a high-ranking warrior in a band of Norse Vikings. This historical angle obviously means more beards, axes, and mentions of Odin than in any AC game before, which I can get down with, but the plot also hinges on the real-life immigration of Viking bands to begin new lives in other nations. This does something new for the AC series: it creates a home base. Eivor and her brother Sigurd have their hearts set on winning over England's ""unpacified"" kingdoms with equal parts diplomacy and pillaging, and both angles are helped by a central base for recruiting, resting, and gathering strength.

Sure, growing your home settlement (named Ravensthorpe, after your clan's affinity for ravens) amounts to a glorified menu system. Gather enough in-game resources to build a fishery, for instance, and you get access to the game's fishing mini-game. Other buildings do everything from adding cosmetic options to unlocking quest lines. But unlike the home bases found in older entries like Assassin's Creed II, this one has much more personality and unlocks brand-new gameplay features—and makes me wish we didn't have to wait so long for Ubisoft to toy with the concept again. It's nice to have a hub that always welcomes your hero with open arms, full of town-specific NPCs and past adventuring companions alike, and it fits into the game's expanded emphasis on narrative.Speaking of: if you were to think of AC Valhalla as a cable TV series' single, lengthy season, you'd land somewhere between SyFy and AMC, and closer to the latter. Its reams of dialog and cast of voice actors deliver about as well as you might expect from over 30 hours of primary and secondary quests. It's perhaps easiest to compliment the game's narrative by way of elimination: one character, who appears in modern-day flash-forward sequences, is a travesty in terms of voice acting and dialog. I point that out because her misstep is the only glaring example I can think of in a cast of hundreds. Everyone else receives ample breathing room to establish traits, quirks, and motives, often broken out in mid-mission dialog passages or optional Q&A moments, and I appreciated how each in-game ""chapter"" of quests (usually two to three hours of adventuring) introduces and establishes at least one interesting character, if not a few.I am also compelled to praise the game's Viking-proud propensity for vulgar and sexual banter. Ubisoft's narrative team was given full rein to let men and women alike revel in the brutal realities of battling as a Viking and celebrating with booze, dance, and outright sexual thirst as appropriate (though always with words, not with awkward polygonal sex). AC Valhalla is a rousing success in terms of going rated-hard-R with its dialog without coming off as sophomoric or leaning on punching-down humor.Plus, roughly every hour in this game, you'll be treated to a shouting match between two very angry people—sometimes two blood-stained warriors, but more satisfyingly between a fighter and an impish noble—that calls for a battle to the death. The trash talk that plays out in these encounters is somehow always brutal, vulgar, and darkly hilarious. That this quality doesn't waver by the game's end is a testament to Ubisoft's Viking interpretation of ""yo momma"" fights. After seeing reports about Ubisoft woes in terms of management and HR, I have to wonder if lower-rung Ubisoft developers used this game's pre-battle face-offs as a way to subtweet at their bosses. If so, I hope it felt as good for the devs to record these lines of dialog as it was for me to listen to them.That dialog is meaningless without an enjoyable game attached, and AC Valhalla gets just enough right to keep you mashing away at a controller for dozens of hours. Much of that boils down to the usual AC open-world formula of quests, combat, puzzles, and mysteries, which Ubisoft has honed to a mostly steady sheen. But I was surprised by the way one major tweak to the games played out: emergent missions.Your average on-foot march, horse ride, or longship charge through the Dark Ages will include some form of organic interruption. Ubisoft knows where you're likely to go in terms of valleys between massive mountains or direct paths between primary mission objectives, and it uses obvious visual and audio clues to nudge you toward passers-by in need of help. That's not anything new in this genre, but oftentimes, such an interruption dumps a new ""quest"" and list of objectives into your pause menu. Like, ""I'm on my way to install a puppet king, and you need me to go to which five chapels to interrupt impure marriages, m'lord?!""AC Valhalla is careful not to interrupt your noble journey in such a manner. Instead, the people you meet along your path offer one-and-done requests, which you complete in the vicinity you find them in. As an example, if you run past a crowd of children while holding two axes and looking determined, those children will lose their minds—you're the closest thing to Lebron these kids are going to see on an average, disease-filled day—and ask to play with you. Sometimes, this will turn into a makeshift game of hide-and-seek, which makes you flex your arsenal of sneaking moves. Other times, they'll want to pantomime war games, so you'll ""fight"" wooden dolls staged nearby.""Nearby"" is an operative word: side-quest objectives, with very few exceptions, do not derail your primary progress or make you fast-travel to another part of the map. But Ubisoft is also mighty clever about what these tasks entail. With less distance to travel, the side-quest tasks you're given do not light up as icons on your map or appear as vague clues in a text sidebar. Instead, you'll get a spoken prompt from the questgiver, then look around their vicinity to find and resolve the objective. Here's one of my favorite examples: early on, a young man says he seeks to engage in an honorable battle; your hero suggests that the man fight a woodland creature as a baby step into such battle-hardened glory, and he agrees. At this moment, you hear some wolves in the distance, and if you run to them, they make chase. The idea: lead the wolves to the man so he can battle them. (This is... not exactly how the quest plays out, but I'll leave its resolution unspoiled.)With these side quests, Ubisoft's quest developers break the mold of the average open-world quest—and seem to openly have fun doing so. Primary objectives, after all, still require romping through massive cities, epic battles, and ""defeat three warlords before you continue"" kinds of sprawl and movement. You'll still check your map for icons and guidance to accomplish those, but since side quests are designed that much differently in AC Valhalla, they can be much quirkier by default—and in ways that don't turn out annoying or tedious. Like the time I had to carry a guy's barrel of apples down a half-mile stretch of road and... nothing else happened. On one hand, this quest toyed with my expectation that carrying apples would devolve into, say, a fight against a bear (which it didn't). On the other, the narrative team took advantage of my rapt attention to host an odd conversation, beginning with a man's love for apple orchards and ending with a sweet conversation about differing religious beliefs. How about dem apples?Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

Assassin's Creed Valhalla,Alex Donaldson,VG247,https://www.vg247.com/2020/11/10/assassins-creed-valhalla-review-a-slow-burn-that-flourishes-into-a-rewarding-experience/,"Vikings have enjoyed another pop-culture renaissance, with high-profile TV shows in the form of The History Channel’s Vikings, and the BBC & Netflix co-production of the adaptation of ‘The Saxon Stories’ series, named The Last Kingdom. Both shows stray from the traditional idea of Vikings that we were all once taught while growing up; There aren’t any horned warriors in sight, they don’t just run after innocent people, butchering them in the process. Instead, both show Viking culture in a different light, one that is more contemplative between their moments of bloodshed and conquest. Enter Assassin’s Creed Valhalla.The game has had a rocky road to release, including the game’s creative director being fired earlier this year, following multiple investigations into allegations of harassment and abuse at Ubisoft.You play as Eivor, who, along with his ally, Sigurd, sail to England in search of a new place to call home after having refused to bow to a new, young king in Norway. You arrive, set up a small community named Ravensthorpe, and are immediately swept up into the well-trodden ground of the Viking Expansion of England around 865 AD. This period of history has since been mythologised countless times, originally in The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, and old Norse tale, The Saga of Ragnar’s Sons. This period of history is especially messy, so it was the perfect place for the creators of Assassin’s Creed Valhalla to introduce our band of Vikings into the mix.In true Assassin’s Creed-style, you’ll get to know and meet famous figures like Ivarr the Boneless and Ubba Ragnarsson, after clearing up the mess left by the Great Summer Army. The plot sees you battle with yourself as you meet the challenges of leading a new settlement, and controlling the balances of power across the kingdoms of England. These stories are dotted throughout England, where you’ll interact with a number of kingmakers, as the scales of power begin to dramatically shift.This is done incredibly effectively, with Eivor pledging to different realms across England, which sets you on different story arcs to tip power in your favour in those areas. You do start to connect with the names and faces in the game, which are equally interspersed with quieter, character-driven moments in between the heavy politics and action setpieces. There are also revelations to be found in the game that left me completely slack-jawed, but I really don’t want to spoil that for you.It’s a compelling story, with twists and turns through the narrative to keep you hooked, and stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the likes of The Last Kingdom and Vikings. Though, your player-character Eivor is just your run-of-the mill ‘brute with a heart of gold’, but as you play, the more Eivor grows and develops into a compelling protagonist, with some shocking moments that we’re not about to spill the beans on.Unfortunately, the near-enough incomprehensible “real world” plot of the Assassin’s Creed franchise continues. Luckily, those moments are still few and far between, but equally bring absolutely nothing to the table when it comes to my enjoyment of the game. At this point, does anyone still really care about it when there’s a whole, much more engaging world to explore and think about? 
 
Make no mistake, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is enormous, and very much follows the traditional Ubisoft mould of littering the map with things to do and places to explore until your legs fall off, including the trademark Assassin’s Creed towers. However, some efforts have been made to change up the status quo, with small environmental puzzles, ‘mysteries’ in the world that break up exploration, and quests back at Ravensthorpe that let you get a little closer to your crew.There are more emergent events that you can stumble upon, too. One of my favourites early-on in the game was about giving a soldier who had just returned home a wash, after he stank out the house, claiming that being covered in poo, and shooting poo-covered arrows gave him an edge in battle. These are dotted about in the game, and are never added to your quest log, giving you an incentive to take a wee break from the near-endless exploration. It would have been nice to be a bit more grounded in the world of Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, with a stronger focus on the stories of the ordinary folk who live there, but there have been clear efforts made so you get an idea of what life might be like in Anglo-Saxon England.During the course of the Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, you’ll hear a distinct mood encompassing the journey, this is in-part due to Ubisoft bringing stalwart musician Einar Selvik on board, ex-drummer of the seminal black metal band Gorgoroth, and a founding member of Wardruna, who frequently have songs featured on the Vikings History Channel show. It’s exceptional work, and only deepens the immersion you feel at key moments throughout the game.When it comes to combat and enemy encampments, Valhalla does manage to break the cycle of the traditional stealth-infiltration loop that was seemingly copied and pasted in every inch of Odyssey’s map. Instead, we have ‘Raids’, which are sieges on settlements or encampments that you’re able to activate when you’re in the area. When you initiate a raid in an appropriate area, you’re able to tackle all the enemies in that encampment head-on, with a band of raiders that you can recruit and select by your side. The raid ends when you’ve collected three pieces of loot that are scattered in the encampment. 
 
For the most part, these are all straight-up melees with large groups of enemies, with nary a hint of strategy behind it. The same mechanic is carried forward in certain moments in the main story, where you’re able to make use of a battering ram. It would have been nice to see other elements make up raids in the game, but the sheer feeling that you get from it is exhilarating. Your reward for completing raids are precious resources to help you upgrade your encampment at Ravensthorpe, and you’ll be needing to do them fairly often. But it never really gets very old, thanks, in part, to the strength of the combat in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla.You’re able to fight in a few different styles, choosing from stealth, ranged and melee approaches, with appropriate skill tree upgrades as you go on, like every other AAA game made in 2020. However, I found the most fun pretty much ignoring any semblance of subtlety or stealth, and attacking-head on with two axes in hand, making quick work of enemies along the way. With a range of different weapons and abilities that you can find while exploring the world, the options you have available to you are impressive. While it’s certainly not a Dark Souls-level of slowness to combat, there is a deliberate pace and balance to your swings, arrows and skills, which are all managed with stamina and adrenaline meters, making it feel weighty, deliberate and satisfying.Gear and skills are tied to combat ability, with gear progression specifically taking a bit of a backseat this time around, with armour and weapons being significantly scarcer than they were in previous games. This essentially forces you into spending your resources into levelling up gear at local blacksmiths, getting you invested early with your character build. This is definitely a welcome change in comparison to the dull, loot-treadmill approach of previous games.It takes a while to really warm up to Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, and 15-20 hours in I wasn’t quite as keen on it as I am now; but that’s thanks to the game holding up, and actually giving you more as you play, in terms of plot, world, activities and getting to uncover the mysteries hidden deep within the game. It breaks some of the chains that the series was shackled in when it comes to design, while also boldly owning its own identity, too. It might not be The Witcher: Wild Hunt, or specifically do anything that breaks the wheel when it comes to open-world game design, but Assassin’s Creed Valhalla gets you invested. It's a slow-burn that takes its time to show you its true colours before flourishing into a rewarding, meaty game that’ll keep you engaged over the winter months.Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla comes to PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series S/X, PS4 and Stadia on November 10, and to PS5 on November 19.

Assassin's Creed Valhalla,Brandon Adams,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/assassins-creed-valhalla-review/,"Assassin’s Creed Odyssey was a long game, and Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is no different in that regard. I’ve put in well over 70 hours at this point, and I have yet to cross the finish line. That’s still a healthy amount of time, and I’ve seen just about every major system the game has in play (assuming there are no 11th hour surprises). So, while I have yet to officially roll credits, I’ve got plenty of thoughts on Valhalla.Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is a dense game. Much like the last two games in the franchise – Origins and Odyssey – Valhalla is a massive open-world RPG stuffed to the gills with content. Valhalla is perhaps a larger game than even Odyssey, though I’d argue it has a better variety of activities on offer and its side-stories are better integrated with the main narrative. It’s certainly not an experience you should try and storm through in a week though, unless you hate sleep.Valhalla is infinitely more enjoyable than the gigantic Odyssey. Assassin’s Creed Valhalla’s England remains a huge area to get lost in, though Ubisoft mercifully saw fit to not map out the entire damned island. It’s a touch absurd I need to breath a sigh of relief they didn’t, yet after Odyssey featured the entirety of Ancient Greece it was a concern. Size wasn’t the only issue with Odyssey’s map: it was filled with similar, routine activities. There’s plenty to love about Odyssey, but I can’t fault anyone who bounced off the game only after a few hours of play.Valhalla starts off on a better foot. The game opens with Eivor in Norway, which is a whole open-world segment in and of itself. After a brief introduction in which Eivor rescues herself and her crew from capture you’re set free to explore Norway as you see fit, and are introduced to Assassin’s Creed Valhalla’s improved selection of world activities. Instead of populating the map with a litany of question marks to identify every little lootable item or event, Valhalla has a color-coded set of orbs that represent Wealth, Mysteries, and Artifacts.Each category is tracked separately on the world map, and standard chests filled with basic upgrade items like leather and iron are divorced from the total completion count. You can zoom in all the way to find and locate these caches of materials, but Valhalla thankfully doesn’t tie them to zone completion. Norway has a healthy selection of each, and it’s here in the cold white north you’re able to sample a little bit of what’s on offer before setting sail for England proper.Until you approach an orb you won’t know what it is, category aside. In a way this change promotes curiosity and exploration in a way that Odyssey and Origins question marks never did. You never quite know what you’re going to get, and the wider selection of activities on offer means you’re often finding new things to experience out in the world. Wealth markers are a bit of an exception, since these are largely key upgrade items (armor, weapons, and ability books fall within the Wealth category, but the materials are far more common to stumble upon).You’re not clearing camp after camp after camp, performing the same checklist of tasks at every single pip on the map, which was a problem Odyssey found itself repeating. You could find a pile of stones to build a cairn out of, a parkour puzzle that leads to a fancy new bearded axe, or one of Valhalla’s many quirky “side-quests”, otherwise known as world activities. Rather than fill your quest-log to the brim with side-quests, Valhalla’s world is sprinkled with a smattering of quick, one-shot vignettes that can be completed in roughly ten minutes or less.The majority of these are utterly bizarre, and provide some much needed levity. Not all of them are winners (one involving viper eggs uses my favorite MMORPG trope of all time: random drops), but they’re far more enjoyable than the smattering of tired, soulless side-quests found in previous games. Throw in flyting (viking rap battles that improve your charisma and open up dialogue options) and the dice-based Orlog, and you’ll find yourself with all sorts of distractions out in the world.Speaking of more enjoyable, the loot is no longer a deluge of similar items with slightly better stats. Valhalla smartly opts for quality over quantity, and each item you can equip is unique. You can use the items found from Wealth markers in the world to either upgrade your favorites via the blacksmith, or improve their stats overall. This new approach works in large part because Valhalla has dropped the more traditional leveling system found in Origins and Odyssey.Power is the name of the game in Valhalla. Functionally it’s not all that different from traditional leveling, but Valhalla’s balance is far better under this new Power system than it ever was with a proper level cap. Your Power doesn’t matter much while in Norway, but once you leave and establish your settlement in England you’ll find the nation broken down into different zones that all have recommended Power Levels. Yes, level-gating makes a return, though it’s a little more flexible here.Whenever you “level” in Valhalla you’re granted two skill points, and once you spend these in the expansive skill tree your Power Level increases. Scaling seems to be based a round a +/-30 window in Valhalla, so a Power Level 60 Eivor can tackle content that’s recommended for Power Level 90. The main narrative rains skill points down upon Eivor’s head, so players worried we were going to have a repeat of Odyssey’s controversial experience gains can rest easy. You can easily pursue just the main story and keep pace.The skill tree is a mechanical improvement over the Odyssey’s, though it’s also a bit boring. Eivor doesn’t merely gain improved stats from “leveling”: every incremental upgrade to your melee, health, defense, etc. is node within the skill tree, all linked together under three categories. Bear is for melee-focused vikings, Raven stealth, and Wolf ranged. You can respec for free at any time, whether you want to reassign a handful of points or remap the whole tree, which opens the door to more creative play. Nothing too groundbreaking here, but it works well enough to provide a better sense of progression.The majority of active combat abilities are learned from books tucked away throughout Valhalla (under the Wealth category), meaning the skills left-over for the skill tree are mostly passive. On the one hand, the skill tree when paired with the streamlined equipment allows for better build diversity and more playstyles. On the other, grabbing a +13 increase to health isn’t exactly the most riveting of upgrades. That said, progression does feel snappier thanks in large part to how liberally Valhalla throws skill points at you, so even those more rote choices start to feel like tangible improvements quickly over time.Combat feels the exact same as it did in Odyssey, even with the added Stamina bar. You’ll block, parry, and dodge between light and heavy attacks, and as you unlock adrenaline bars you’ll weave in those aforementioned combat abilities. Stamina does make combat somewhat more deliberate, but since it’s easily replenished from successful light attacks it’s remarkably easy to ignore in general combat. During one of Valhalla’s many boss battles Stamina comes more into play, as you are forced to dodge or parry your way to victory, but the combat’s weaknesses truly come into the fore during these encounters.Inputs still feel delayed and mushy, everything feels floaty, and attacks often lack any sense of impact. It can still be fun (wielding a giant two-handed claymore in one hand and a giant great shield in the other is perhaps my favorite weapon combination ever, though dual-shields come close), but it overall devolves into a button-mashing affair where each swing of Eivor’s weapon feels like it’s cutting through empty air, not Saxon flesh.The so-so combat isn’t enough to rob many of Assassin’s Creed Valhalla’s various activities of their guilty charms. I will never grow tired of smashing the “Raid” button whenever I float near a village or monastery Eivor and their crew can plunder. The fortress assaults that show up in the story are simple, yet I won’t lie and say I didn’t enjoy felling scores of Saxon and Briton forces as my viking horde pushed the line with a battering ram. Combat may not be the greatest, but the encounters outside boss fights still have their charms.Combat is okay overall, but stealth is far improved. One-hit assassinations make a return (either via a skill in the Raven portion of the skill tree, or a permanent toggle in the Gameplay menu), as does social stealth. 9th century England is littered with settlements and villages that are not openly hostile towards Eivor, but they are wary of the towering Dane. Donning your hood allows you to slink past guards relatively unnoticed, though you can always join a procession of monks or grind some wheat to drop any unwanted attention.The A.I. isn’t always the sharpest or most consistent, however. Sometimes they’re just not as aware as you’d logically expect, as you stab a sentry and drag their corpse into a bale of hay while their buddy watches. That’s at least comical in some regard, because you can whistle and lure the idiot into the same trap. It’s when the A.I. develops a sixth sense for your presence that stealth gets annoying. By and large this wasn’t a common issue, but for every blind guard who somehow failed to witness their buddy getting murdered by the hay-viking there were two that would spot me a mile away from behind cover.The story is the best we’ve seen from the series since Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag, with a more focused script that flows more succinctly across the game. In Odyssey, the Misthios was on a simple quest to find their family (at least at the start), but the tale often felt like it was plodding along. Valhalla’s story is even longer than Odyssey’s, but thus far it’s been a far, far more entertaining lark. The larger narrative is bolstered by the various zone arcs that make up the bulk of Valhalla’s narrative, and each introduces a cast of characters that are eminently more likeable than anyone I met in Ancient Greece. These arcs all come together in interesting and cohesive ways, and the story constantly feels like it’s moving forward.Even the actual side-stories that are tied to the main narrative, similar to Odyssey’s First Civilization and Cult of Kosmos arcs, are better woven into the plot. I won’t go into spoilers here, but I will say the Cult system does make a return and it isn’t nearly as bloated. You’ll still have to hunt down clues for some of Eivor’s greatest “hits” list, but the main story does a better job integrating this system within the narrative. It feels less like a separate side-activity that just so happens to have a major impact on the plot, and more like a natural extension of Valhalla’s tale.Valhalla being an Assassin’s Creed game means there’s some Isu and Modern Day crap to deal with, though I love how the former has been handled. I actually love all the First Civilization insanity, with their Apples of Eden and seeming omnipotence, but their arcs have always been either relegated to ham-fisted plot-twists, or reserved for later DLC. Valhalla weaves the First Civilization storyline into the main narrative in a more alluring and compelling way than any previous Assassin’s Creed game before it, and the story is all the better for it. This aspect of the game is best left unspoiled, but suffice to say I much, much prefer this approach over Odyssey’s, and you should unlock the seer in your settlement as soon as possible.As for the Modern Day arc with Layla, well, I can either take it or leave it at this rate. While I may love the better integration of the Isu and actual mythology with the main story, I’ve grown weary of the tale set in modern times. Part of this is largely due to how Ubisoft has made this arc optional. Another is how much of it takes place in “cross-media” content like novels and comics, meaning I have to play catch-up with every new Assassin’s Creed title. I just . . . I just don’t care anymore. My opinion on this may change by the end of the game, who knows, but I’m far more interested in Eivor’s tale, the continuing proto-Assassin v. Templar plotline, and Isu stories.As for the Modern Day arc with Layla, well, I can either take it or leave it at this rate.But, I have to be blunt: Valhalla’s story is substantially longer than Odyssey’s. Because Ubisoft has better integrated all these once disparate elements into the main plot the story takes upwards of 80 hours to clear. Throw in all the side activities, weapon upgrades, and events tucked away in England, Norway, and elsewhere, and you have a game that exceeds Odyssey in length. It may not be as large a game in scale, but it’s a substantially denser experience.Look no further than your settlement, which is upgraded over the course of Valhalla. It grows from a longhouse and some shanty tents into a sprawling hub where you’ll return to pick up new story quests, upgrades, and cosmetics. The settlement is a reflection of how far you’ve progressed in Valhalla, and mine is sitting at tier 5 out of 6 after 70 hours of play. Again, Valhalla is perhaps the densest game in the Assassin’s Creed franchise.It’s also nearly the buggiest, though Unity gets to keep that crown. Perhaps it was the COVID-19 pandemic forcing the team to work from home, but holy Hel does Valhalla have a plethora of small, inane bugs. A.I. pathing straight-up breaking is the most notable and frequent (making the “Play Dead” ability largely useless), but I’ve seen boats floating tens of feet above water jittering in the breeze, peasants jet-skiing across lakes and rivers via their faces as their arms and legs twitch about, and have fallen through the map and lost nearly an hour of progress three times. This was with the day-1 patch mind you. Assassin’s Creed Valhalla often struggles under its own weight, and while none of the bugs I encountered were game-breaking (falling through the world a handful of times aside), they were frequent.Performance was equally concerning. On an Xbox One X the game tries to maintain 30 frames-per-second, but it often hovers just below that mark. Screen-tearing is constant, and audio frequently cuts out. Facial animations easily shift between good and uncanny within the same cutscene: there’s just a lot of jank here. I get it, this has been a hard year for game development, but the quality-assurance teams clearly needed some extra time with Assassin’s Creed Valhalla. I’ll update this review with my Xbox Series X impressions once my console arrives Tuesday, but I’ve heard even there the game struggles to maintain a solid 60 frames-per-second, which is one of its major selling points on the new console.And that’s where I’m sitting at the moment. I know the end is in sight, but damn me is Valhalla a dense game, denser than even Odyssey. It doesn’t feel as monotonous or repetitive as Odyssey however, making the longer runtime something I enjoy rather than loathe. In many ways it’s been my favorite game in the series since Black Flag launched seven years ago. England and the other areas are a joy to explore, the skill point oriented Power system makes “leveling” feel less like a barrier than it did before, and the emphasis on unique gear and builds has allowed me to lean into a handful of different playstyles.But, by Thor’s hammer, is the game janky. Bugs plague the experience, performance is mediocre, but at least it’s pretty! Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla takes all the previous systems introduced in Origins and Odyssey, and streamlines them into a more focused experience. The game may have some flaws, and it’s a shame to see the combat remains mediocre after all these years, yet Valhalla is easily the best entry in the recent trilogy. Grab your axes and shields: it’s time to go a-viking!
Attack of the Fanboy / GAME REVIEWS / Assassin’s Creed Valhalla Review"
Assassin's Creed Valhalla,Mick Fraser,God is a Geek,https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/assassins-creed-valhalla-review/,"10 November, 2020You can’t play as many Ubisoft games as I have through the years and not be familiar with the “Ubisoft jank”, that phenomenon where an otherwise great game is plagued not by a poor story or bad design decisions, but by a seemingly endless parade of bugs and glitches. Most recently, Watch Dogs: Legion suffered this fate, but it has been a recurring problem in Ubisoft’s franchises forever, and Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is no different. From two-headed Vikings to disappearing NPCs and catapulting corpses, Valhalla runs the gamut of technical glitches. And the fact that they haven’t in any way undermined my enjoyment of the game is testament to what a great job Ubisoft Montreal have done in all other ways this year.In fact, a lot of those bugs were probably unavoidable for a number of reasons, but primarily because Valhalla might be the densest open world game I’ve played. It’s a common complaint in the genre that a world is too open, too empty, just great big fields of nothing connecting activities. This year’s Ghost of Tsushima boasts one of the busiest I’ve seen, but Valhalla tops even that. Fears that this would end up being bigger than 2018’s Odyssey will likely be proved true, but as with Kassandra’s and Alexios’ Greek adventure, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is heaving with things to do.Thrust into the fur-lined boots of Eivor Wolf-kissed, your opening hours in the icy northlands of Ryglfylke, Norway, will be spent finding your feet. Perhaps deciding whether to be male or female, which you can switch at any time thanks to an anomaly in the Animus, or whether you’re going to be loyal to your elder foster-brother Sigurd, or in it for yourself. Without a hint of exaggeration, I had been playing for five hours before I saw the game’s title card, and by then I was well and truly ready for what lay beyond it.Valhalla is the (almost) mature form of what Assassin’s Creed has been attempting to evolve into since Black Flag: a true open world RPG built on player choice and player freedom. By the time you sail away from your beloved Norway to begin a new life of pillaging and conquest in England, you’ll understand all of the systems and details you need to progress – at which point Ubisoft Montreal begin to throw more at you every few hours.Most of it is nothing new, if we’re honest. You’ll chase down pages caught by the wind, which this time contain cosmetic designs for your tattoos and hair instead of shanties; you’ll come across high level mercenary knights in the wild who’ll hunt you down if you get too close, a la Odyssey; you’ll listen to your crew sings songs and tell rybald stories as your boat cuts swathes through the water, and you’ll use your hidden blade (this time worn on top of the wrist purely because Eivor is such a stone-cold badass) to slay members of the Templar Order hidden across the vast map.But you’ll also raise an army with which to raid Monasteries for silver and supplies, turn a few huts on the riverbank into a bustling village, challenge fellow warriors to drinking contests and hunt ancient legends through the Fens. You can take part in flyting (rhyming) contests that improve your charisma, and solve world events and mysteries to strengthen Eivor’s bond with the land. I’ve often said that it’s the protagonist that makes an Assassin’s Creed game succeed or fail as much as the setting, and Eivor is a solid candidate. Played female, she moves between being coldly calculating and a fiery force to be reckoned with; played male he’s as quietly savage as Vikings’ Ragnar Lothbrok and as charming as The Last Kingdom’s Uthred of Bebbanburg. There’s a soul to the character who, in classic Assassin’s Creed fashion, has no idea of their own fate or why people seem to flock to them.The story as a whole is pretty compelling, as what begins as a quest for vengeance becomes something much more as Eivor and Sigurd sail to England to carve themselves a new life from mud and blood. Sigurd’s newest travel companions, Basim and Hytham, hail from the Brotherhood of Assassins, and it is they who induct Eivor into their ranks to help track down a sect of Templars who have seized positions of power in Saxon England. Or, at least, that’s what they tell you. Although, it’s not simply the plot that impresses, but your place in it. Ubisoft throw many decisions at you throughout the story, and are often clever enough not to reveal the repercussions until much later, preventing all but the most dedicated from save-scumming until they get the better outcome. These decisions impact many things from your allies and enemies, to whether characters live or die, stay in England or sail away forever. It’s a personal story in all the ways that count, and Eivor is a sound protagonist to experience it with.They’re also brutal, which is probably to be expected. The combat in Valhalla feels deliberately less nuanced and tactical, trading Odyssey’s cautious approach for a chain of blistering assaults on your unfortunate foes. Eivor can wield a number of weapons from axes and swords, to hammers, flails, two-handed great-axes and sharp daggers. They can even wade into battle dual-wielding shields if you like and the combat is built for a multitude of combinations.Fights are fast-paced and satisfyingly violent, with finishing moves that damn near rock the screen. The onus is on beating an opponent to their knees and going for a Stun Attack, which will often finish a fight there and then. With a standard light, heavy, parry, evade set-up, the combat is nothing we haven’t seen before, but with added Viking. Even light blows come down hard, and a variety of unlockable abilities and special skills steadily form a lethal, vicious arsenal with which to defeat your enemies. Of course, you can choose to go the stealthy route if you like, surveying the area with your raven, Sunin, before sneaking into an encampment and despatching enemies from the tall grass – but as with Odyssey before it, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla likes to watch you dance. A predictably dizzy camera can often be a minor hindrance during larger-scale fights, but it’s nothing game-breaking.To match the vast map, you’ve a vast skill tree, filled with dozens and dozens of nodes to unlock with skill points. Each node will increase an attribute such as Health, Stealth Damage or Bow Range, while every few will unlock a new finisher or special move that can be mixed in with your combat repertoire, such as the ability to quickly switch dual-wielded weapons from hand to hand in order to vary your attacks. Each node you unlock increases your overall power level, which is what determines which Shires of England you can survive a trek through and which you’re better sailing around or sneaking across until you’re tougher.And it’s worth exploring everywhere, too. While the familiar vantage points return from which you can survey the surrounding lands and synchronise Layla’s memories in the present, Ubisoft Montreal have littered the map with things to find. From little settlements and enemy outposts to hidden collectibles, environmental puzzles, amusing side-concerns, bounties to hunt, side quests to embark on, treasures to track down and legendary beasts to hunt for great rewards.The gear system has been toned down considerably since Odyssey, with equippable loot found much less frequently. Instead, the focus is on finding the materials necessary to upgrade each item you come across, altering the appearance at your blacksmith and improving the stats yourself by using up your supplies of metal and fabric. As a result you spend less time sifting through vendor trash and more time switching gear to suit a specific style. Armour sets are divided into Wolf, Bear, and Raven classes, offering bonuses to ranged, melee, and stealth skills respectively, with further bonuses conveyed for wearing half and full sets. Graded from basic grey through bronze, silver and gold levels, your armour choice is as important as using the right combination of skills and stats.As you raid and adventure, you’ll bring home supplies and materials with which to build your settlement. Each level you raise it will introduce new residents and new opportunities for buildings such as a shipyard, tattoo shop, merchant, stables and barracks. The latter also allows you to create your own Jomsviking, a soldier-at-arms who can be summoned by other players like a Pawn in Dragon’s Dogma, and will bring you back a tribute each time they’re used.Even after 20 hours, I was discovering new things in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla. Secrets and Easter eggs, or new activities, characters and stories. The world, too, is stunning, and just as in Watch Dogs: Legion I found myself grinning from ear to ear when a character mentioned a place that’s just down the road from me in the real world. From the snow-draped crags of Norway to the gilded hills and shimmering rivers of Mercia, Valhalla’s world begs to be explored, more than once giving me pause to take a screenshot or simply marvel at the level of detail. Ubisoft Montreal might have crafted their most beautiful setting yet, and every moment I spent in it gave me something new to admire.But, predictably, such a dense open world comes with its fair share of issues and even playing on PC with a GeForce RTX 2060 card, I had to fight with the graphics settings to maintain a stable framerate even when the in-game performance monitor was telling me it was stable. There’s so much going on here, from reflections in puddles to flocks and herds and packs of wildlife, staggeringly beautiful sunrises and battles with upwards of twenty combatants and a few dozen screaming NPCs, that I often experienced heavy stuttering despite what the framerate counter said that didn’t go away until I restarted the game. A pre-release patch fixed a lot of my issues, and further patches are promised, but it’s worth mentioning.I also had a few problems with the enemy AI in general. For the most part they aren’t clever, and will often mill around or stand still during combat. The background fighting is mostly there for effect, of course, and it does it’s job – especially during Assaults when you have to take upon the battering ram as the armies clash around you – but it can break the immersion a little when the identikit enemies stand still or can be seen fighting with empty air. I’m sure it was done better in Odyssey, though my memory could be playing tricks.Technical problems aside, I have no substantial complaints about Assassin’s Creed Valhalla. I’ve loved every minute of it. Whether or not it’s objectively “better” than Odyssey is hard to say, as deep down they are very similar games, but where I began to lose interest in the Twins’ story, I haven’t in Eivor’s – even the modern world Abstergo stuff is kept to a minimum but still compelling enough to follow, and the Layla character is still a million times more interesting than Desmond Miles. Your mileage will vary based on your tolerance for the Ubisoft Checklist, but fans of the series, the era, and open world RPGs in general will be easily swept away by the currents of Valhalla’s beautiful and brutal world.Superb setting
Brutal, satisfying combat
Compelling story
Incredibly dense world
Great cast of charactersSo many technical bugs
Enemy AI is inconsistentDespite some worryingly customary bugs, Assassin's Creed Valhalla serves up a treat for both series fans and RPG afficianados. Eivor is a great protagonist, while rural England and the snowy climbs of Norway provide some of the best adventuring in the franchise to date. Your home for all your videogame needs.

But while the graphics are as gorgeous as they come, the gameplay is decidedly last-gen. Once again, you’ll take control of a warrior who finds himself embroiled in a battle between two secret societies at a pivotal point in history. Once again, you’ll assassinate a few dozen high-profile targets and unravel a big conspiracy. And once again, you’ll explore a truly enormous world that starts off interesting, and gets repetitive the longer you play.If this sounds damning, it shouldn’t — not entirely, at least. Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is still a fun game, and a perfectly good way to dive into your new console this fall. (Although it’s also available on current-gen systems and runs just fine, for those who aren’t ready to take the plunge yet.) The combat system is both nuanced and enjoyable, the world has plenty of mysteries worth exploring and the central story is pretty good — even if the Assassin’s Creed connection is not immediately apparent.If Assassin’s Creed Odyssey left you wondering whether the formula would get another much-needed shakeup, Valhalla’s answer is a contented shrug. But at the very least, Valhalla is no worse than the games that came before it — and there’s always some value in the franchise’s meticulous historical tourism. Read on for our full Assassin’s Creed Valhalla review. Assassin’s Creed Valhalla delivers one of the settings that fans have been requesting since the early days of the series: the Viking Age. You take control of Eivor: a prominent son (or daughter) in a family of noble Danes. He and his brother Sigurd set out to establish a settlement in England for honor and glory — and to distance themselves from the ambitious King Harald back in Norway. Once there, Eivor learns about an ancient cult that could threaten England’s stability, and it’s up to him (and his clan) to sneak, fight, explore, build and raid his way to victory.As in previous Assassin’s Creed titles, there are three main components to gameplay: Combat, stealth, and exploration. And, as in Origins and Odyssey, stealth takes a definite backseat to the other two. You’ll spend a ton of time in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla riding your horse across the fields or piloting your longship through the rivers of medieval England. The map is huge (although not quite as staggeringly large as Odyssey’s), and objectives are spread pretty far apart, so get ready to take in a lot of (admittedly gorgeous) scenery along the way.Exploration has both its charms and its frustration. As you traverse the English countryside, you’ll come across three types of side activities: artifacts (collectible doodads), wealth (powerful weapons or abilities) and mysteries. The first two are pretty straightforward, and collecting them gets tiresome early on. You can only raid so many camps or solve so many small environmental puzzles before you start to wonder whether you really need that legendary axe or Roman artifact.Mysteries, on the other hand, represents some of the best of what Assassin’s Creed Valhalla has to offer. These side activities aren’t the simple fetch quests or combat challenges of Origins and Odyssey. Instead, they could be just about anything, from instigating a mock raid by lighting a cottage on fire, to eating hallucinogenic mushrooms and solving brainteasers, to proving your wit in Viking rap battles. (This is a real thing. It’s called “flyting,” and it’s probably the best recurring side quest in the game.)As such, a lot of exploration is repetitive busywork, but a significant minority of it comprises challenging, creative quests. I’d often want to make a beeline for the mysteries in each new area, then begrudgingly remind myself that Wealth and Artifact quests were also vital for earning experience and equipment.As you might expect from a game about Viking raiders, combat takes center stage in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla. You can equip a variety of weapons, from battle axes to spears to bows, then take on large groups of enemies with your light, heavy and ranged attacks. You can collect special abilities from Wealth sub-quests, learn passive abilities by gaining experience and prioritize your favorite types of skills and equipment as you level up. For the first time in the series, you can also dual-wield weapons if you wish to forego a shield — although you’d better be extremely confident in your parry timing.Combat is fairly similar to Origins and Odyssey, with an emphasis on fast attack, parries and dodges, particularly when dealing with large groups of foes. However, this time the camera pulls back a little farther than before, and enemies don’t have quite as much HP, making combat more manageable and streamlined.I found the experience a little easier than the last two games (particularly since if you do a lot of side content, you’ll almost always be over-leveled for the main quest), but there are two mitigating factors. First, your healing options are limited, meaning that a few mistakes early on can cost you an entire battle. Second, your stamina (which you use for both heavy attacks) is limited, so you can no longer dodge indefinitely. Parrying is more vital than ever — which is why maybe it wasn’t a fantastic idea to make the “dodge” cue red and the “parry” cue an extremely similar orange, but you’ll learn to tell them apart over time.Combat is varied enough to stay interesting, especially since you’ll encounter many different enemy types, each with different strategies. But this time around, mass combat is where the real fun is. Unlike the simplistic, repetitive Conquest Battles in Odyssey, Valhalla prompts you to raid camps and monasteries up and down the waterways of England. Since every raid target is different and no two store their wealth in the same place, each raid presents a challenging and dynamic experience. The rewards are also absolutely vital: materials to help build your settlement.Another semi-new feature in Valhalla is Ravensthorpe: Your home settlement in England. By collecting materials and investing them in local businesses (a fishery, a brewery, a tanner and so forth), you can improve your settlement, which gives you access to new customization options and quests. It’s not terribly dissimilar from building up your villa back in Assassin’s Creed II, but the end goal is more varied than just making money.If you thought that a pulse-pounding Viking warrior fantasy doesn’t exactly square with a measured stealth game about surgically removing key targets, you may be disappointed to learn that you guessed correctly. While stealth is still very much a part of Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, it’s taken a backseat to open combat again. In fact, if you don’t want to use it, it’s almost never necessary — and if you get good enough at open combat, stealth honestly doesn’t even save you that much time or trouble.There’s not much to stealth, mechanically speaking. Press a button to crouch; stay quiet and out-of-sight to avoid alerting enemies; sneak up on them from behind or above to assassinate them with the series’ iconic hidden blade. Most enemies will go down in one hit; a select few can’t be assassinated outright, but it’s much less of an issue than it was in Odyssey. More difficult targets may also require a short timing minigame. If you build up Eivor with stealthy skills, it’s a viable way to play, but the game really does orient itself around open combat, whether it’s raiding a monastery with your crew or fighting one of the game’s many difficult bosses.Speaking of character progression, it’s a little more interesting here than it was in Origins or Odyssey. Rather than just choosing skills and automatically becoming more powerful, you’ll have to pick and choose which abilities and stat boosts you want. You need relatively little experience to level up, and each level confers two “skill points,” which you can use to unlock various nodes on a huge board. These nodes might increase your melee resistance, or your stealth damage, or your affinity for a certain type of equipment, so there’s a lot of leeway to optimize Eivor to fit your playstyle.Certain nodes will unlock new areas of the board, so leveling up is always a tug-of-war between “This skill could be useful” and “I wonder what that skill could reveal.” (If you’ve played Final Fantasy X, it bears more than a passing resemblance to the Sphere Grid.) It’s an organic and satisfying way to customize a character.The year is 873 CE, and the Danes have never been more powerful. But they’ve also never been more divided, as the eager young King Harald of Norway points out when he attempts to unite the warring clans. Wishing to forge their own kingdom rather than swear fealty, Viking brothers Sigurd and Eivor gather their townspeople and set off for England. There, they hope to establish their own Dane settlement among the warring Saxon kingdoms.In terms of Eivor’s personal story, it’s all pretty compelling stuff. The friendship between Eivor, Sigurd and Sigurd’s wife, Randvi, provides a strong emotional core, and there are lots of interesting side characters who show up in each new chapter. The conflict between the pagan Danes and the Christian Saxons is rooted in real-world history, and it’s interesting to follow how the two groups get along — and how they don’t.The only big drawback to all of this is that the connection to the ongoing Assassin’s Creed mythos is pretty tenuous for a large chunk of the game. Eivor is not an Assassin (or Hidden One, since the “Assassin” moniker is still a few hundred years off at this point), nor does he especially want to join their ranks. He wears his hidden blade openly and agrees to hunt the Order of Ancients (the proto-Templars) only because Sigurd made a few Assassin friends during his travels.An Assassin’s Creed game where stealth is secondary and the main character is only tangentially associated with the titular group can work, as Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag demonstrated. But Black Flag also had an extremely deep and detailed ship combat mechanic to fall back on; Valhalla is the usual gameplay loop, but without an explicit Assassin connection.There’s also a modern-day section where you’ll play as an Assassin named Layla, who was also our POV character in Origins and Odyssey. The sections themselves are just there to give the historical story some context. There’s a decent mystery at the center of Layla’s story, but you probably won’t think about it too much between interludes.Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is supposed to show us what the PS5 and Xbox Series X can do when it comes to cross-gen games. It’s entirely possible that the next-gen version of Valhalla looks amazing; they weren’t available during the review period, however, so I’ll have to judge based on a PS4 copy, played via backwards compatibility on a PS5.The good news is that the game is beautiful, either way. From the mountains of Norway to the rolling hills of England, the landscapes are rich and varied. Before all is said and done, you’ll find your way through meadows, forests, marshlands, military camps, towns, churches, monasteries and even some more exotic, spoiler-laden locations. The rich color palette and detailed textures make the game pop, particularly when you’re exploring a green area on a sunny day. (Since this is still England, a lot of the game takes place in gray, dreary weather, and that’s OK, too.)The sound design is also top-notch, with spirited performances from Magnus Bruun and Cecilie Stenspil: Danish actors who voice the male and female versions of Eivor, respectively. When you sail your longship down English rivers, your crew will regale you with stories or play Scandinavian tunes. Even just the range of accents in the game, which vary from Dane to Dane and Saxon to Saxon, depending on your exact region, is impressive.At the time of writing this Assassin’s Creed Valhalla review, I’ve sunk about two -dozen hours into the game, and I’m willing to go back for more. I enjoy the combat system, the story and the sense of exploration. At the same time, the fact that I’m probably only about one-quarter of the way through gives me pause. This game has a ton of stuff to do; some of it is fun, some of it is tedious, and I sometimes wonder whether the balance is favorable.Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is an easy enough recommendation for series fans who want to find out what happens next, or next-gen buyers who want a meaty open-world title for their first PS5 or Xbox Series X foray. Still, it’s hard to shake the feeling that Assassin’s Creed, as a series, has had much more interesting, inventive and focused games in the past. Now that the Origins/Odyssey/Valhalla trilogy is complete, it’s probably about time for another big shakeup.Marshall Honorof is a senior editor for Tom's Guide, overseeing the site's coverage of gaming hardware and software.

Please try again Tetris Effect: ConnectedScore: 8.5/10  Platform: Xbox Series X|S (reviewed), Xbox OneDeveloper: Resonair, Monstars Publisher: Enhance Release Date: November 10, 2020 ESRB: ETetris Effect, which launched for PlayStation 4 with support for PlayStation VR back in 2018, dragged the decades-old puzzler kicking and screaming into the modern era, updating graphics, effects, music and modes to create a dynamic conundrum for just about every mood, from chill to frantic.This new Xbox edition keeps everything that made the original one of the best puzzlers in years (except the VR part, which it turns out is pretty unnecessary) and adds a heaping helping of multiplayer to the mix.Playing online or in the company of family and friends (the latter in happier, non-pandemic times that await us in the future, of course), multiplayer includes a pair of innovative modes that see groups of three people working together to battle a “boss” — either human or AI — by clearing lines and eventually fusing their matrices together so that all three can drop blocks across an expanded grid.It also includes a variety of one-on-one matches, including a classic mode that eliminates contemporary Tetris features, such as the ability to drop blocks instantly, hold pieces and continue spinning tetrominos once they’ve landed — an ideal way, we found, to put parents back on even footing with their speed-gaming offspring.All this, plus some truly hypnotic 4K graphics and terrific music, including a beautiful reimagining of the original Tetris theme. It’s a must for puzzle fans.Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold WarScore: 8.0/10  Platform: PlayStation 5 (reviewed), PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Windows PCDeveloper: Treyarch, Raven Software Publisher: Activision Release Date: November 13, 2020 ESRB: MConfession: I’m the weirdo who plays Call of Duty mostly for its short but usually spectacular solo campaigns, and this one doesn’t disappoint.Set in an impeccable rendering of the early 1980s, when tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union were at their peak, the 2020 entry in Activision’s perennially popular war shooter series embraces its titular descriptors, sending a group of international spies on a series of patently illegal operations with the blessing of none other than that of the Gipper himself.You can even tailor the game’s protagonist to have a variety of questionable traits — including violent tendencies and unpredictable behaviour — which will impact the story in subtle ways.The action is a bit less focused on big battles than other Call of Duty games, with elements of stealth and even lockpicking thrown into the mix. But it’s still just as unflinching — and often as controversial — as you’d expect, with scenes that allow players to do things like choose whether or not to murder dodgy folks rather than capture or release them.Online play, meanwhile, is as slick as ever, supporting cross-platform play and rewarding players who put in the time to learn the maps, develop class loadouts that play to their strengths, and work in cooperation with teammates when called for. Expect more chaotic combat with match support for 12-on-12 and a new Fireteam mode that allows up to 40 to take to the field together.Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War does very more-of-the-same in places — it’s the franchise’s 17th instalment, after all — but when a formula has been so fine-tuned, it’s hard to expect the developers to monkey around with it too much.Watch Dogs: LegionScore: 7.0/10  Platform: Xbox Series X|S (reviewed), Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Windows PCDeveloper: Ubisoft Toronto Publisher: Ubisoft Release Date: October 29, 2020 ESRB: MWatch Dogs: Legion delivers an uncanny vision of a near-future London in which shadowy entities have implemented familiar technologies to watch and control the population. Ubisoft’s writers use this setting as a platform to take a firmly progressive stance on political matters ranging from privacy to immigration.This milieu plays into the game’s most daringly original mechanic, which is that you can play as pretty much anyone you see in the city. There’s not one central protagonist, but instead the population of an entire city fed up with the thumb under which they all live. All you need do to recruit someone is walk up to them and start a conversation. Once you’ve helped them with a problem, they’ll join the resistance and become a playable character — often with their own unique skills and gear, depending on their career and knowledge.It’s a neat idea that opens up interesting options in how you go about missions. For example, a recruited construction worker can blend in with people on a construction site rather than going in guns blazing. Plus, you get the sense that the whole city is alive with individuals of endless diversity, and each seems to have their own little story.The problem, unfortunately, is that something feels missing without a true hero character with a deep backstory and lots of personal demons and vendettas to drive the narrative forward. The only real constant is a snarky AI that helps all resistance members and acts as a sort of guide and conscience.Playing (pre-release) on Xbox One we experienced a chuggy frame rate and several crashes, but our experience on Xbox Series X has been smooth as butter. More than that, London rendered on next-generation consoles is pretty as a picture, with beautiful lighting effects that include puddles on its wet roads that perfect reflect the city and its gorgeously overcast sky.Demon’s SoulsScore: 9.0/10  Platform:  PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Windows PCDeveloper: Bluepoint Publisher: SIE Release Date: November 13, 2020 ESRB: MWith its ingeniously labyrinthine environments, extraordinarily challenging stamina-based battles and sadistic punishments for dying, From Software’s Demon’s Souls for PlayStation 3 was a decidedly love-it-or-lump-it affair. But it turned out there were enough who loved it that it would become the first game in an entirely new subgenre of action role-playing games in which players willingly and masochistically subject themselves to incredibly tough combat while chasing a rarified sense of satisfaction.Now, more than a decade later, the original game has returned, completely remade to make the most of Sony’s next-generation hardware.Yes, it’s pretty. The medieval-inspired fantasy world is beautifully rendered in 4K with jaw-dropping vistas and delectable little details. And yes, the developers have found fun ways to make use of PlayStation 5 tech, such as using 3D Audio to give us a better sense of where off-screen monsters lie in wait, and leveraging the DualSense controller’s sophisticated haptic feedback to make us feel every clink and clank of metal meeting metal.But the real draw here remains, as it ever was (or wasn’t depending on your gaming proclivities), the tense, gritty, nerve-wracking combat. Slowly making your way through a castle, a hollowed out mountain, or a twisty maze of high cliff paths, terrified of what might be around the next bend and all that you might lose should it kill you, is as compelling now as it was 11 years ago. The controls are tight and empowering and enemies tough but fair. The key, as always, is to have patience and learn from your mistakes.Demon’s Souls isn’t likely to convert many new players to this kind of game design, but fans of gruelling but gratifying game experiences are in for a treat.Sackboy: A Big AdventureScore: 7.5/10  Platform:  PlayStation 5 (reviewed), PlayStation 4 Developer: Sumo Digital Publisher: SIE Release Date: November 12, 2020 ESRB: EIf you’re among the many gamers who spent more time just enjoying the creative level design and unabashedly upbeat vibe of the LittleBigPlanet games rather than actively creating and sharing content using its game editing modules, then Sackboy: A Big Adventure is tailor made for your tastes. It drops all the make-your-own-game stuff and simply offers, as it name suggests, a great big platforming adventure in a fully 3D world — a first for the series.It’s easy to get distracted with all the fun PlayStation 5 wizzbangery Sony injected into this one. You can use the system’s new Activity Cards to check your progress on specific levels and jump straight into them from the Home screen, as well as access tidbits of help throughout the game. And there’s no question it looks great, loaded with textures for objects like sponges and cloth that look so real and detailed you’ll want to reach into the screen and run your hand across them.But these next-gen bonuses eventually fade into the background, leaving us to focus on the game itself, which — happily — is a lot of fun.It doesn’t take a lot of risks. You’ll run around a little hub world choosing visiting shops and choosing levels filled with various running and jumping challenges, plus some signature Sackboy moves involving tugging, pushing and hanging onto stuff. But it’s well executed and wonderfully easy to just sit down and play for 20 minutes here or there.Plus, the action is set to a buoyant soundtrack filled with music that perfectly matches the family-friendly hijinks. Don’t be surprised if you find yourself humming these tunes long after you stop playing.Dirt 5Score: 7.5/10  Platform:  Xbox Series X|S (reviewed), PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Windows PCDeveloper: Codemasters Publisher: Codemasters Release Date: November 10, 2020 ESRB: E2020 marks the first time in a decade that Microsoft’s popular series of Forza racing games has taken a year off (strange timing, given the launch of Xbox Series X|S), leaving a car-sized hole in the game release calendars of driving aficionados.Happily, gearheads can still quench their lust for dust this fall with Codemasters’ Dirt 5, a straightforward arcade-style racer that looks lovely running on next-generation hardware.Car games have always been used as platforms to show off the potential of new consoles and this one is no different, delivering photorealistic rides with sophisticated lighting effects that include near-perfect reflections of the gorgeously muddy, hilly, icy environments through which the game’s rally cars can be found careening at break-neck speeds.Indeed, it’s the thrilling sense of velocity paired with an accessible interface — this is a game in which, with the right assists turned on, drifting almost takes of itself — that makes it so easy to move from one race to the next through an otherwise pretty basic career mode. It just makes driving feel fun.There are also other ways to play beyond the career mode, including local and online multiplayer, a trick-based Gymkhana mode, and the ability to create and share your own short tracks.It may not be as deep or sophisticated as many other modern racers, but Dirt 5 is nonetheless an entertaining outlet for engine revving on Xbox Series X or PlayStation 5. Assassin’s Creed ValhallaScore: 8.5/10  Platform:  Xbox Series X|S (reviewed), Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Windows PCDeveloper: Ubisoft Montreal Publisher: Ubisoft Release Date: November 10, 2020 ESRB: MWhen we look back on the launch of this generation of consoles, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla –— perhaps the most ballyhooed third-party game made for both PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S — is bound to hold a prominent place in many gamers’ memories, if for no other reason than that they’re likely to spend somewhere north of 60 hours working through its huge story.Set in the 9th century and focused on the notoriously aggressive Viking expansion tactics of the era, it provides us with an enormous, sumptuous world filled with fascinating historical personalities, locations and political turmoil. In turns educational and entertaining, exploring England as an invader and doing things like discovering the legacy of famed Viking warrior Ragnar Lothbrok is rarely anything short of exhilarating.Players take on the role of a young Viking named Eivor — whose gender identity can be chosen by the player — intent on serving revenge to those who killed their parents. But the plot grows far beyond these humble beginnings as our hero — who, as customary for the series, is actually just a construct of memories accessed by a modern-day protagonist using a fictional device called the Animus — gradually becomes aware of the ancient and complicated conflict between the ideologies of control and freedom that has driven Assassin’s Creed lore since its inception.It doesn’t take any particularly daring risks compared to its two most recent predecessors, Assassin’s Creed Origins and Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, but it does refine the formula established by those games. Combat is quicker and more brutal, befitting the types of warriors involved, but still offers options for tactical planning as well as some exquisitely animated choreography.The franchise’s famous environment traversal mechanics — essentially parkour — are similarly streamlined yet no less satisfying, thanks largely to the undeniable compulsion the game instills in players to keep moving to see what lies beyond the next ridge or river. Exploration is a driving force.And, of course, it looks phenomenal and runs smooth as an oil slick on next-generation hardware. Players looking for a substantial game that shows off the graphical capabilities of their new systems that will keep them busy well into next year won’t be disappointed in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla.Yakuza: Like a DragonScore: 7.5/10  Platform: Xbox Series X|S (reviewed), Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Windows PCDeveloper: Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio Publisher: Sega Release Date: November 10, 2020 ESRB: MQuick Yakuza primer: Sega’s epic crime syndicate series focuses on flashy gangsters involved in violent antics within Japan’s seedy underworld, featuring action-packed brawls, loads of side quests and mini-games, and limited sandbox design. Characters are known (and oddly beloved) for their corny dialog, yet most entries somehow still manage to tell propulsive and memorable stories led by an antihero worth rooting for.Yakuza: Like a Dragon, the eighth game in the series, embraces most of these elements — particularly in some of its sillier character exchanges and broad range of mini-games — but takes a big detour when it comes to combat, which is now turn-based rather than real-time.Players take on the role of new protagonist Ichiban Kasuga, a gangster who finds himself embroiled in a somewhat melodramatic series of illicit events involving the Arakawa crime family. We control Ichiban — and several of his associates — in tactical brawls, where the action pauses between moves, allowing players to select character-specific attacks in a manner similar to traditional turn-based role-playing games. Most fights aren’t particularly long or overly complicated, but they often take a bit of tactical thinking. More importantly, they represent a breath of fresh air in a series that’s been growing a bit long in the tooth.It helps, too, that the whole game has been optimized for Xbox Series X|S. Building architecture and city streets aren’t as impressive as in some other next-generation launch games, but character models are mesmerizing, detailed all the way down to the stitching patterns on clothes.This one definitely won’t be for all tastes, but players with a penchant for Japanese culture and a love of tactical combat are bound to find a little slice of criminal soap opera heaven in Yakuza: Like a Dragon.GodfallScore: 6.5/10  Platform:  PlayStation 5 (reviewed), Windows PCDeveloper: Counterplay Games Publisher: Gearbox Publishing Release Date: November 12, 2020 ESRB: TOur recommendation of Godfall comes with more caveats than other games on this list, but a specific subset of players is bound to have a great time with Gearbox’s quirky “looter-slasher.”It’s set in a flamboyant fantasy world reminiscent of Asgard as presented in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, filled with impossibly shiny alien metals and too-bright colours that, if nothing else, show off the impressive processing prowess of the PlayStation 5. And its characters, a collection of superhuman warrior avatars battling mythical monsters in an attempt keep a man named Macros from acquiring the power of a god, are majestic in their madly elaborate suits of plated mail.Members of Godfall‘s development team have a history with Bungie working on the Destiny games, and it can be felt in the combat and design. Players may be using swords and shields instead of rifles and rocket launchers, but they’ll quickly fall into the familiar routine of fighting small groups of enemies en route to big boss encounters, collecting a never-ending stream of weapons and gear ranked by rarity and completing random objective quests while grinding to gain experience, resources and, of course, more loot.It grows repetitive, but the dodging, blocking, parrying, slashing combat — while a bit overly complicated at times — should prove challenging and gratifying enough to keep fans of this sort of game moving forward. The slightly gaudy next-gen visual spectacle is just gravy.Marvel’s Spider-man: Miles MoralesScore: 8.5/10  Platform:  PlayStation 5 (reviewed), PlayStation 4Developer: Insomniac Games Publisher: SIE Release Date: November 12, 2020 ESRB: TIf there’s an essential PlayStation 5 launch game, this is it. Not just because it was built to show off the console’s advanced graphics, 3D audio, and new DualSense controller features, but because it’s a lot of fun and tells a great story, to boot.It marries the world of Sony’s hit PlayStation 4 game Marvel’s Spider-Man with that of the animated film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, introducing us to a broad cast of interesting, likeable characters as our titular hero takes on the task of protecting Manhattan while “the other Spider-Man” goes on a European vacation. It’s jam-packed with funny, heartwarming, wholesome scenes and dialogue.And it’s a pleasure to play. Swiftly and effortlessly swinging through corridors of New York skyscrapers is exhilarating, and the combat choreography is stunningly cinematic. If it weren’t for the repetitive nature of some side activities — such as tracking down loot stashes and saving civilians — it would earn must-have status.As is, it’s still the best game to show off PlayStation 5’s potential to players of all ages — especially if you want to have a terrific time in the process.Financial Post Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion and encourage all readers to share their views on our articles.

Assassin's Creed Valhalla,Alice Bell,"Rock, Paper, Shotgun",https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/11/09/assassins-creed-valhalla-review/,"For better or for NorseAssassin's Creed Valhalla starts in Norway, spends most of its time in 9th century England, and even has some optional detours to the present day or mythical Asgard if you fancy it. But the latest entry in Ubisoft's used-to-be-annual franchise about stabbing your way through history just kept making me think of Texas, for two reasons. The first, and most obvious, is Texas as in ""everything's bigger in"". Valhalla just feels like it has more of everything. The map is huge, with each area having its own mini-saga of warring locals and power struggles to complete to get them on side. There's a whole menu of evil Templar agents to hunt down, a la Assassin's Creed Origins and Odyssey. There are themed gear sets to collect and upgrade. There are side missions a-plenty, ranging from stealing clothes from nudists, to tripping on mushrooms, to collecting Roman artefacts. And stealthy assassinations are back, too. Valhalla is daunting and messy, but it's also a pick 'n' mix of all the best bits from the series. With cool Viking haircuts thrown in.




Watch on YouTube    
The plot, such as it is and such as you'll need or want to pay attention to it, follows Eivor the Viking and his/her (you can switch gender whenever you like) adoptive brother Sigurd leave the overcrowded, wintery shores of their homeland and pitch up in Mercia - basically the midlands - looking to make their mark and carve out a new home. Tensions rise as Eivor does, er, basically all the work at both, while Sigurd becomes ever more convinced that he is an all powerful, fated ruler. You can throw in Eivor having some dreamquest visions of Asgard if you're feeling saucy.The England of Assassin's Creed is summer cusping into autumn, so you get to gallop across grasslands full of flowers, but also get mud and rain and orange leaves. And it's also very transient. Towns and settlements change hands a lot, hamlets burn down and are built again. That's the other reason it made me think of Texas. The one and only time I have been to Texas I was in San Antonio. I walked past a tour learning about the history of the downtown area of the city, and overheard ""... this hotel was built in 1979..."", which made me laugh. And Valhalla does feel similarly unmoored from history, or at least unmoored from a comfortable, recognisable one. Most other AssCreed games have had something a modern player can lodestar to a bit. Ah yes, the coliseum. Or the pyramids. Or Notre Dame. Valhalla is set in England but, in fact, it isn't, because England didn't exist yet. Cities like Norwich and Oxford and Leicester are there, but not as we know them. The most permanent landmarks are leftovers from Ancient Rome, and ones that no longer exist in the same form today. It's all in flux, and it's a curiously unrecognisable setting to me in comparison to, say, Watch Dogs Legion. And on this lump of wet clay stamps Eivor, in their big size nines. They're a very charismatic protagonist, whether you choose male or female Eivor. They're pragmatic, if tending towards violence, uncomplicated and extremely confident. But they also have a few poetic words of wisdom ready for any situation, be that crowning the new king of a region or rescuing a tame wolf at the behest of some lying children. The adventures and comedic japes they get into are very varied, and I remain delighted that this time Ubi have handed me a lot more trust than in previous games. Quest markers are comparatively few. One early mission involved rooting out a traitor by figuring out which boat belonged to whom, and where it had ended up - and I got nary a marker to tell me where the clues where. I had to, if you can imagine, listen to and remember what people said and follow up on it. I felt like Columbo with a big blonde plait. Marple with an axe. Eivor is also fucking massive, much like my beloved Kassandra, as are most of the Norse in the area. This is especially compared with the teeny Saxons. It's a wonder they ever pick fights with the Vikings, although I understand that they probably have mixed feelings about me, a giant warrior who burns down their churches for no real reason other than to steal everything in the area.You quickly enter what we may call the ""core loop"" of Valhalla: at your new settlement Ravenholme you pick a region to forge an alliance with. Ride over, meet with the locals, and usually depose whoever is currently in charge and replace them with your own man - a Saxon willing to work with the Vikings, perhaps, or a Dane whose been hanging around the area a while. The culmination of this is usually an attack on a big fort.Raids are, like a girls hockey team playing an away game and absolutely smashing it, jolly good fun. You and your mates run around yelling, bashing people with heavy sticks and trying to take as much ground as possible. Combat is fast and often confusing, with blocking and parrying returning and given more importance than ever. You have the option to mix and match your main and off hand with whatever weapons you like. I favoured the shield and axe combo that you start with, but there are flails, hammers, big swords. You can even double shield it if you want. This does mean that melee combat is unavoidable at times. You can tilt Eivor towards melee, ranged or stealth, but really you're going to need to put a chunk into melee. There are levels where you're called upon to save or assassinate a target, and it feels like an early AC game as you sneak around with your hood up, being all casual as you find a way in to a storehouse or a church. But if you don't pour some levelling effort into melee, you're going to have a harder time.You level your Eivor with skills and abilities. The former are passive, unlocked on a big star map not entirely unlike a Final Fantasy Sphere grid. Mostly these give you things like buffs to different damage types, but you can also unlock things like a mighty stomp that smashes a stunned enemy. Abilities are active. Big moves you can dust off in a fight, like throwing loads of axes all over the place, covering your weapon with grim poison, or weaponising your raven pal to attack (that being the thematically appropriate replacement for an eagle this time). Abilities are unlocked by finding and looting special books that impart the secret knowledge of e.g. firing like a bajillion arrows from your bow all at once. These are hidden off the beaten track around the map, or in monasteries and settlements you can raid. And here everything loops back around on itself like an ouroboros with tattoos and a longboat. Or possibly, an ouroboros but specifically the snake that eats the world from Viking myth. There are many, many parts to Valhalla, but they manage to all link into one another in a way that just about works, but is difficult to explain if you're not actually playing it right now, as we speak. Like riding a bike where even the frame and the handlebars are in motion. Don't stop, or think about it all at once.You level up by exploring and fighting, yeah? But unlocking skills is what increases Eivor's power level, and different regions are soft gated by that. So, too, are monasteries and abbeys to raid, which is where you get the raw materials you need to upgrade your settlement and gear, the latter of which makes you better at fighting and the former unlocks extra side quests like killing templars or hunting legendary animals like Black Shuck. And there are only so many monasteries per region...This does result in some janky bits. There are the usual NPC bugs you expect from any game of this size, and I sometimes saw grass floating above the bridge it was supposed to be on. But there are also just bits where things don't quite make sense. I had a conversation with a guy who said he'd never heard of Norway, and then ten seconds later told me that Norway was twice the size of Mercia. One side quest I came across was an old Viking raider living in self-imposed exile on an islet. He asked me to stop by his old house if I was ever in a certain town. That certain town was about 500 yards away. But this game is huge, with so many moving parts that some are bound to collide into one another, and there are other details that work and are fun to notice, like a kind but impractical noble slipping as he climbs into a boat, or the fact that you can buy horses named after the deadly sins and they have livery to match the theme. Valhalla is so complex that it's a poor entry point if you've never played an AC game before, and it's not killer content all the way down. You're as likely to run into a fetch quest where you have to kill shitloads of hares as you are a little vignette about two families arguing over crops. But you know what? For fans of the series it's really entertaining. It might not set the world on fire, but you can set some virtual bits on fire yourself if you want. I think running towards an abbey with terrible purpose, yelling ""KILL CHRIST! AND BURN HIS HOUSE DOWN!"", is the energy a lot of people want right now. I dunno how well that would play in Texas, though.You're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!

Assassin's Creed Valhalla,David Flynn,GamingTrend,https://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/snacks-fit-for-odin-asassins-creed-valhalla-review/,"The reign of kings has come to Norway. The Jarls of the land have all decided to place their fealty in the hands of one man. This causes a split in the Raven Clan, with some accepting the new rule while most follow their former prince to greener pastures: England. After establishing their small settlement of Ravensthorp, they seek to establish peaceful relationships across the four kingdoms, whether that means installing their own kings or just helping their new neighbors with their troubles.In Assassin’s Creed Valhalla you are put into the soft calfskin boots of Eivor, a Viking warrior-poet who helps lead the charge into England for the Raven Clan. You’ll choose whether Eivor is male, female, or you can let the Animus decide. Surprisingly, this selection is not permanent, allowing the player to switch to the other DNA stream at any point, letting the Animus decide will even swap at some moments automatically. You can customize your Viking aesthetic from your gender all the way down to Eivor’s hairstyle and tattoos. Customization is a bit of a theme in Valhalla.Storylines in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla take a very different approach than its predecessors. There is a central thread that runs throughout, but stories are more told in a saga format. Vikings would frequently sit down and tell exaggerated stories about how they once bumped into Odin in battle, or how one time Freya came to them in their bed. These roll out as more individual storylines with a beginning, middle, and end, letting you experience the game in chunks. It’s a bit like playing several, bite-sized RPGs in one. At the center of all these arcs sits Ravensthorp – your settlement. The last step of every single quest chain will have you return here, and you can use your spoils to build new facilities, homes, and even decorate the town as you like. This is also the only place you can change up your look and upgrade your gear, and it always feels good to come home, giving the game a more unified feel than Origins or Odyssey.You can tackle these arcs in just about any order you wish, though you will probably save the more difficult areas for later on in the game. There is a ton of freedom in progression here. After the opening hours in Norway, you can essentially go anywhere and do anything you want. I generally tried to keep myself on track for the main story to finish in time for this review, and the emphasis is definitely on “tried”. Sailing my longship through England’s rivers would frequently be interrupted by seeing something or someone just off the riverbank I wanted to check out, and all of these distractions are well worth your time not only for the rewards but also simply for the fun of them. While the main plot takes itself mostly seriously, the side quests are anything but. You can help an old woman find some eggs so she can pollute the city with her rancid farts, assist some nuns in beating up bandits, reassure a little girl that her father will return before the last leaf on her tree falls, and then shoot said leaf to the ground. And all of what I just described is in the first area. There is so. Much. Content. In this game to discover and you can do it on whatever platform you like. Ron Burke was playing the game on his PC, only to discover that once installed on his Xbox Series X his save was readily available to be continued.One of the things I enjoyed most about Valhalla is that it doesn’t feel like I’ve visited a Goodwill for weapons every time I hit a new town. Instead, and much like the way real-world Vikings would, you maintain and upgrade weapons. Deciding your fighting style is less about numbers and more about how an axe and shield feels in your hands. Danish long axes, spears, daggers, and even dual-wielding shields are all not only possible, but viable. Much of this comes from the way that skills are doled out. Each level you simply gain 2 points to allocate in the Final Fantasy X sphere grid-like skill tree. You begin in the center of three trees, each aligned with the Raven, Bear, and Wolf much like gear, and work your way out by purchasing stat upgrades or abilities.Vikings look to the stars for their guidance, so it’s no surprise that it’s where they draw their power. As you level up you are given two skill points to allocate. Looking skyward, you’ll see familiar constellations with each point unlocking stat improvements and core skills like being able to stomp a downed opponent, or chain assassinate foes in stealth. Beyond the skills that descend from the stars, you’ll want to seek out Books of Knowledge. Solving challenging puzzles you’ll find books that contain the skills that are mapped to your face buttons. Examples of these powers are throwing a barrage of axes, charging into a foe and beating them senseless on the ground, or my personal favorite throwing a grappling hook in them and jerking them into walls or their comrades. Not all of the abilities meshed well with my playstyle, but those that did were extremely satisfying to use.Taking these skills into the field showcases the absolute brutality that Vikings brought to the battlefield. Finishers ravage your opponents, beheading them, smashing their head between two hammers, or stomping their skull into bits, just to name a few. Odyssey had solid combat, but it’s clear that the team has worked hard to tighten this system up, while adding a few new tricks to make it fresh. When targeting enemies with ranged weapons you’ll spot glowing red or yellow weak points that can be used to turn the tide. Pinning a well-armored foe to the ground with a well-placed arrow lets you rush in for a brutal critical (and often fatal) attack. Combat overall feels more weighty and precise, while keeping you on the offensive. Your ability to attack, parry, and dodge are all governed by the stamina meter – run out and certain actions will be much slower or impossible. However, landing a light attack will replenish a portion of your stamina meter, so you may want to break your opponent’s shield with a string of heavy attacks, finish them off with light attacks, then use the adrenaline gained from that to take out another in one shot.Your choice of weaponry will greatly affect your combat abilities as well, you can go for the traditional axe in one hand and shield in another or using a larger, two handed weapon, but I found the most fun in dual wielding. We’ve already mentioned you can use two shields, but you can also take axes, flails, or hammers in hand(s). Using two of the same weapon type is ideal, since you can make use of both in every swing, but you can put whatever you want in whatever hand you want as well, later on there’s even a skill to allow dual wielding two handed weapons. The weapon in your main hand will determine your basic combos, while what’s in your off hand will let you perform a secondary attack by holding the left bumper. It’s a lot of fun to experiment with weapons, until you realize that the penalty for using two different weapons is just too great. I’ve stuck with dual axes for most of my playthrough, but as of writing I’ve yet to find a second flail or hammer to maximize those playstyles.Vikings (which in a historical context is actually what the people did, not what they were called) have a reputation as being fierce warriors who destroyed everything in their path, but there’s more to their story than that. Many just wanted to carve out their own slice of life. That said, they tended to carve that slice out of the neighbors. Raiding churches for their silver and artifacts yielded the supplies needed to firmly plant their feet. Assassin’s Creed Valhalla embraces raiding completely, allowing you to sail up to any settlement and initiate an attack on it to liberate their precious goods. Hauling back these supplies lets you upgrade the settlement, attracting more settlers and building opportunities. Carving your own place in the world makes the whole thing feel more alive.The gigantic open worlds you’ll be exploring likewise feel very alive. Whether you travel the Swan Roads, the regular roads, or off the beaten path every inch of Valhalla is teeming with life and secrets to find. Your compass at the top of the screen is your guide to points of interest in the world, and the specificity of the information is determined by your exploration difficulty. Combat, Exploration, and Stealth difficulties can all be adjusted separately. Combat and Stealth are self explanatory, but different exploration difficulties will allow you to see things on the compass such as a marker’s distance or automatically marking the nearest undiscovered location. I went with the hardest option for each of these, and I would recommend you at least pick the hardest for Exploration, called Pathfinder. The world is just so vibrant that I feel you would be selling the experience short on anything less. There are innumerable side activities in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla. Competing against other Vikings in mead drinking challenges, playing an ancient board game called Orlog, or going fishing because every good RPG needs to have a finishing minigame. The best thing, however, is “Flying”. Flyting is the act of using wordplay to attack your opponent using a rap battle-esque call and response. If you’ve played a Monkey Island game, you know exactly what to expect.This is tied directly to a new stat to build — charisma. In some conversations, you can choose to turn on the charm to bring someone to your way of thinking if your charisma stat is high enough. For example, early on you need to bribe a fellow Dane for information, but with your charisma at level 2 you can negotiate down to half of what you would have paid otherwise. So not only is flyting a ton of fun (and a good way to earn silver besides) it’s extremely useful if you want to save time or money or even avoid bloodshed.If you would rather engage in selective bloodshed with, say, a small blade attached to the forearm, stealth is almost always an option. Skulking around in shrubbery is the same as always, but actually doing the dirty deed has been improved greatly. Previously, enemies you couldn’t assassinate in one shot would still give you a big critical hit, but now there’s a small quick time event which does allow you to instantly kill them and remain in stealth. As someone who prefers this approach, this is an absolute godsend, finally allowing me to pick off entire enemy camps or even fortresses, then calling in my raiders to finish the job.The most interesting addition to stealth isn’t something you do, but rather places you go. As a Dane in England, there are several locations where people already distrust you aptly named Distrust Areas. In these zones you’ll quickly be attacked for suspicious activity of any kind such as walking too fast, so you need to keep your hood up, blend into crowds, or stick to rooftops if you don’t want the entire city guard coming after you. You can no longer mark enemies with your bird either, only using the pulse-like Odin Sight to make them visible through walls at a close range, so stealth overall is more involved and, as a result, more interesting.While I don’t want to spoil any of the story, there are some interesting choices to make along the way, it for the most part avoids the frankly uninteresting overarching story of the series. I was only taken out of the Animus once to reintroduce Layla and the gang, and never again until the credits rolled. Personally, I’m not invested in the Assassins and Templar conflict anymore, and even when I was it was mostly in passing interest, and I wouldn’t mind if they just dropped the modern day storyline entirely. The gimmick has worn out its welcome, and I’m glad the developers have been focusing more on what they do best and seem to be more interested in – creating a fun, fictionalized version of history to run around in. I really appreciate both the accuracies and intentional inaccuracies here, like women actually having agency and being prominent characters instead of… well, real history. While I haven’t found any major queer characters, Eivor themselves can be queer in certain ways. As previously mentioned, you can change their gender between male or female at will, but you can also romance a few characters as well regardless of your gender. Personally, I like to think of my Eivor as an asexual trans woman who’s more interested in hitting things with her axes than kissing. It’s great that you’re given this amount of freedom, but more can always be done to accommodate even more people. For example, fashion slots for gear (including lower tier versions, which are lost upon upgrading) or, dare I ask, a non-binary option. Still, as it is, Valhalla goes above and beyond to make sure all types of players can enjoy themselves.As always, there are a wealth of accessibility options available. You can rebind every single action on both keyboard and gamepad, for example I chose to rebind the Stomp attack to X instead of R3. You can invert all kinds of axes, turn off blood and/or nudity, adjust the intensity of vibration, and change the size of every element of the interface, from icons to text. You can even turn on a text to speech function or enable a noise when Eivor walks into a wall. I am a sighted individual, so I don’t know exactly how useful options like these are, but I do know that hard of sight players are often not thought of at all in game development and it’s nice to see these considerations taken.I am lucky enough to be able to clearly see and hear the world of ACV, and it is drop dead gorgeous, even on low settings with my aging GTX 970. You can see the pretty for yourself in our 4K footage (thanks Ron!) and I would highly recommend headphones to experience the detailed soundscape of England. The music, while I wouldn’t listen to it on my own outside of the game, set the mood extremely well whether you’re exploring the rolling hills of Grantebridgescire or raiding a monastery with your crew. The sound effects are likewise incredible and help immersion immensely, nothing gets me into a game like various boots on floorboards sound effects, weirdly enough.Unfortunately, Valhalla isn’t perfect. While the game runs surprisingly well on my old graphics card, apart from frame rate dips in populated areas like Lunden, I frequently encountered strange clipping issues where Eivor would become one with a pillar I was pushing or shafts of light flickering through solid walls. The biggest technical issue is the game’s horrendous pathing, the follow road option would sometimes take me in the direction opposite of my tracked quest and quest important NPCs would get stuck on walls or just stand in one place. I’ve also encountered about three crashes to desktop, all in the late game. Most of these can be fixed simply by reloading the game, and thankfully it saves frequently so I only ever lost a minute of progress at most. Hopefully these can be ironed out in future patches, but what won’t be ironed out is the cash shop, where you can purchase armor, mounts, and even items to skip content like exploration for real world cash. This feature still feels gross and manipulative as it has in the previous games, but it’s easily ignored apart from an advertisement on the main menu. Don’t support these practices and hopefully it’ll go away.Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is the best open world RPG this year.

			Ubisoft's quasi-historical adventure finds its way to 9th century England... and provides the best Assassin's Creed game in a decade
		I don’t know, you wait for what seems like years for video games to pitch up in England and two come along at once. Ubisoft has found fertile ground on these shores with Watch Dogs Legion and now Assassin’s Creed Valhalla. But while one in a dystopian view of near-future London, Valhalla takes the quasi-historical series to the verdant 9th century wilds of the entire country. A chance to indulge in your Viking fantasy, beach your longboat on the shore of the river Trent and raid pesky Saxon monasteries with an axe in hand and Norse brethren at your back.Ubisoft has done some raiding of its own to build Valhalla, adapting ideas and philosophies from other games in order to refine its own. In its sprawling naturalism, shifting countryside and off-piste distractions is the influence of Red Dead Redemption 2, it looks to invoke Breath of the Wild’s constant sense of exploration and there is even a smattering of Sekiro in its approach to combat.Valhalla can’t quite match its inspirations --that would be some feat indeed-- But there is the tremendous sense of lessons learnt, weaving improvements into its own tapestry. But the biggest influence on Valhalla is Assassin’s Creed itself. This is the game that marries the vibrant stealth-action of its earlier entries with its more recent RPG trappings. It’s not just because the hidden blade returns. Or that you can swan dive from battlements into the conveniently placed hay bales below. Or even that you have your own hub --Ravensthorpe-- to build and maintain in an echo of Assassin’s Creed II’s Monteriggioni.These all help, but it is about its broader, more organic sense of adventure. Origins and Odyssey were fine games that breathed new life into the series, but more mechanical RPGs coming to terms with a new identity. Valhalla seems far more comfortable with itself. And the result is the best Assassin’s Creed game in a decade.Eivor helps too; a brusque, smart and entertaining companion. You can choose to play Eivor as male or female, with the default being a third option that very occasionally swaps them up in a narrative conceit tied to the game’s brief and infrequent modern day sci-fi interludes. Though for the majority of this ‘canonical’ choice, Eivor is a woman, and it feels difficult to imagine it was intended any other way. Even if Ubisoft’s marketing team has a penchant for her more hirsute alter ego.After a lengthy prelude in the snow-swept wilds of Norway, Eivor and her head-strong brother Sigurd go a-viking to England. The goal is a simple one: conquest. By espionage, diplomacy or simply giving Englishmen a good kicking, Valhalla has you sweeping through our fair country and conquering counties one by one. Starting from the base of Ravensthorpe in the Midlands, your gaze spiders outwards. North towards Jorvik and south towards Lunden and Canterbury, a predictably vast expanse of land with an intimidating amount of stuff to see and do.Being an Assassin's Creed game, the map quickly becomes peppered with icons and waypoints. Yet Valhalla manages to be far more organic with its exploration than more recent entries. In between following the main story's simplistic but diverting thread of brisk pillaging, it is easy to venture into the verdant countryside and find yourself drawn off the beaten path to a Roman ruin or suspicious crypt.Treasure is hidden in tricksy alcoves you must figure out and navigate. Ancient Order goons are there to be tracked down and assassinated. Mad Vikings and Englishmen might need your help burning their own house down, for instance, or there are mini-games of flyting (Eivor is a talented poet) and drinking challenges (and a fine quaffer of mead). It's not as if previous Assassin's Creeds were bereft of things to do- and there is still a sense of information overload at every turn-- but it is more of a pleasure to lose yourself in what feels more like discovery than checking things off a list.An early story mission is a decent indicator of this, where you are tasked with finding a traitor in your Viking midsts. You hunt out evidence, talk to suspects and witnesses and then must come to a fatal decision without much in the way of hand-holding. Playing Viking detective was not something I expected to do during Valhalla, but it is a game that --while following much of its traditional template-- is capable of surprise.Perhaps more expectedly, you will spend much of your time as Eivor smashing things with an axe. Combat has the medieval heft you might want from 9th century skirmishes, taking great swings with two-handed weapons, dual wielding blades or packing a shield in your off-hand. It is generally fairly simple stuff, but takes a leaf out of From Software's book which allows you to wear down an enemy through parrying before executing a brutal finishing blow. It doesn't have the variety to entirely sustain itself over the course of the game --even as you loot new weapons and unlock new abilities in Valhalla's sprawling skill trees-- but it is rarely less than satisfying.It particularly comes into its own during more sprawling battles with your Viking pals at your side. Story arcs within the game will typically come to a head with a grand assault on a fortress, smashing in gates with a great battering ram and careering through enemy armies. There are also raids scattered throughout England, with you pillaging monasteries for supplies crucial to building up Ravensthorpe amid the sound of crackling fire and the bellowing of your Viking horn.It is a good thing that the more direct form of scrapping works well as the stealth element is not quite so successful. Eivor finds herself with the assassin's hidden blade for sneaky stabbing and is able to cloak herself to hide her vikingness from suspicious Saxon guards. But such espionage crumbles all too easily, with keen eyed guards seemingly able to spot you from miles off, leaving you to do it 'the Viking way', as Sigurd would say.Fortunate, then, that Valhalla's ‘Viking way’ is a splendid thing indeed. It may not pierce all of its targets and rough edges remain. But its willingness to learn from others, while plundering its own gilded history means that Assassin's Creed is ever closer to being the game it has long threatened to be.Assassin's Creed Valhalla is out now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S (version tested), PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Google Stadia and PC"
Assassin's Creed Valhalla,Tom Bramwell,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/nov/10/assassins-creed-valhalla-review-ubisoft,"PS4 and PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series, PC; UbisoftThe weather’s as bad as ever, but this smart, inventive and witty open-world game is a veritable Viking feast of adventureIt’s been a wild ride this year, but you can always rely on Assassin’s Creed to lighten the mood. Let’s see what those zany historians at Ubisoft have cooked up for us in the excitingly named Assassin’s Creed Valhalla … Peterborough, is it? Norwich in the dark ages?I have nothing against our beautiful cathedral cities, rolling plains and park-and-ride services, but after 12 months of Brexit, Covid-19 and forest fires, plus the cancellation of the Eurovision song contest, I was hoping for something a little less Tough Mudder from this giddy, quasi-historical, action-adventure series, which previously had us gallivanting around Atlantis.For the first few hours, you’re thrown into the icy political drama of ninth-century Norway, where Viking warrior Eivor runs around snow-blasted islands having stern conversations about the future of her clan. (You can play as a male or female version of Eivor, or have the game swap between them at intervals. I went with female Eivor.) This extended prologue plays out a bit like a Scandi Phantom Menace, and, after a while, Eivor and her brother Sigurd give up and decide to build a new life in England. It’s for the best.Everything improves when you get to England (apart from the weather). Eivor and Sigurd establish the settlement of Ravensthorpe, then strike out into Mercia, East Anglia and beyond to forge alliances. Inevitably, this means riding around picturesque countryside (or sailing down rivers in your longship), solving people’s problems, collecting loot, and climbing churches, cliffs and Roman ruins.Ancient Egypt and Greece were easy to enjoy, whether you were tunnelling under the Sphinx or hanging from the chiselled penis of a Zeus statue, so the dark ages have their work cut out here. But, while this vast playground is less showy, it soon starts to feel more rarefied. Points of interest on your map are intriguing – a locked building that must be clawed open with a bit of lateral thinking, a man selling an elixir that promises instant wealth, or a piece of cloth that happens to be wafting above a parkour obstacle course. I’ve got used to autopiloting around vast, open-world games tidying up icons on the map, but this feels more like exploring again. There’s repetition, sure, but also novelty.There are plenty of little villages to ransack, but these are now treated as Viking raids, where you beach your longship in the mud, blow your horn, and set off to do some pillaging. Fighting people hand-to-hand is the usual mix of dodges and parries, but there are nice additions such as dual-wielding that alter the rhythm of combat. There are ludicrous numbers of special attacks to unlock and add to your repertoire, and these are now tied to exploration as well as levelling up, which is a neat change. It’s harder to hide in bushes, marking enemies before silently dispatching them, but it’s a testament to the strength of this new approach to fighting that I forgot about that fairly quickly.While the game sends you far and wide, the spoils of battle are most useful back home in Ravensthorpe. Reminiscent of Assassin’s Creed II’s beloved Monteriggioni, here you can build a blacksmith’s, a Hidden Ones assassins bureau, a hunting lodge, a Gregg’s and plenty more. (OK, maybe not the Gregg’s.) New buildings and settlers allow you to do new things out in the world, and Ravensthorpe is also where you turn in collectibles for rewards. There are a lot of decent quests to pick up here from friends and travellers, and as usual it’s the cranks and weirdos who make for the best fun.Eventually, I wandered back on to the critical path and started doing story missions. My litmus test for open-world story missions is whether I pull out my phone whenever a cinematic begins, and I certainly did with this game. Eivor is likable enough and the story of her Raven clan is full of twists and turns, but we’ve been on this kind of journey a bunch of times already. If you want a Norse mythology game with real heart, play the latest God of War.Never mind the stuff you watch – it’s the things you end up doing in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla that are most compelling. At one point you’re told to identify a traitor in the ranks, so I steeled myself to run between map markers and watch bad acting, but instead found myself sleuthing around Cambridgeshire, interrogating people and checking alibis. At one stage, my wife walked in and asked me what I was doing. “I’m looking for a yellow boat! Help me find the yellow boat!” I imagine it makes a nice change from seeing me doomscroll on the couch.Assassin’s Creed Valhalla takes a while to get going, but don’t be disheartened by its mirthless opening, because the smart, inventive and witty open-world game you’re hoping for is lurking somewhere over those gloomy hills and dales. Can we have our next assassin holiday somewhere sunny again though, please, Ubisoft? Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is out on PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series S/X and PC on 10 November, and on PS5 on 19 November; £51.99."

Here’s how it works.Assassin's Creed has been a yearly franchise since Assassin's Creed 2 in 2009 all the way up until 2015 with the launch of Assassin's Creed Syndicate. After years of complaints that the series has grown stale, Ubisoft skipped a year before releasing Assassin's Creed Origins in 2017, what was its biggest departure from the series' formula to date, leaning more towards an RPG than ever before.Ubisoft once again skipped any new Assassin's Creed release last year, but it has a lot less to show for it. Assassin's Creed Valhalla feels very much like Odyssey, which itself felt like a reskinned Origins with an emphasis on personal choice. Luckily, minor changes do impact gameplay in a big way, so it's not a complete rehash, but for as long as Valhalla's main story is, you'd think there would be more depth.In a year where COVID-19 transformed how game developers work, it's hard to say what Valhalla may have looked like in a normal world. As it stands it's a great game, but one that I think could have done more to differentiate itself from its most recent predecessors. Everything from the gameplay loop and the way characters interact with the world around them feels recycled.Bottom line: Assassin's Creed Valhalla provides a gorgeous playground to explore with excellent combat. Though the story seems unnecessarily long, it's a fun Viking tale mixed with the series' own flare and sci-fi elements.Much of the leadup to Assassin's Creed Valhalla was spent with Ubisoft explaining that your Viking clan sailed for England after war ravaged Norway, but it didn't at all play out like I expected. Instead of fleeing because of war, you flee because of peace. Eivor and their brother Sigurd are not happy that their father has pledged loyalty to a new king who means to unite the country, so they go to England to seek glory of their own. Going to England isn't so much about settling a new home, but about conquering new land — again, the opposite of what I was led to believe from Valhalla's marketing.Valhalla strikes a good balance between the historical sections and present day.The story in England is fairly linear. Sigurd and Eivor work to create and strengthen alliances in its various kingdoms, which mostly plays out as follows: help the Danes depose the current king or find friendly Saxons to help depose the sitting king. Either way you mostly end up with the same result that ends in an assault on a castle. There's some politicking involved, but I found much of the territory arcs to be ""rinse and repeat,"" swapping out characters and locations for largely the same sequence of events.There came a point maybe 20 hours or so in when I didn't feel like I was making an impact in any meaningful way. With Sigurd off securing alliances and Eivor doing the same, I spent my time running from territory to territory, assaulting castles and burning supply stockpiles to overthrow whoever was sitting on the throne. It didn't seem like there was any narrative incentive to do so other than ""conquer more than."" I don't know what my end goal was.It gets more interesting once you come to learn how The Order of Ancients (Templars) have been pulling the strings behind the scenes and what they know of the Isu (the ancient species at the heart of the series). As controversial as these sci-fi elements are to the franchise's fans, they make the story so much better here. So much so that I would have liked to see more from it.Ubisoft has struggled to balance the historical sections and the polarizing modern day narrative in Assassin's Creed over the years, succeeding to varying levels of affect. I think Valhalla strikes a good balance, giving enough content for modern day fans to enjoy while not distracting too much from the historical sections fans love. You can leave the Animus at any point once you progress past the opening of the game, and there are some fun Animus Anomaly parkour challenges that play into the series' sci-fi elements and lore.Speaking of lore, mythical worlds like Asgard and Jotunheim are explorable after you unlock the Seer at your settlement. They offer a breath of fresh air to break up the landscapes of England, as beautiful as it may be. I know some were concerned about Valhalla's take on these myths given the success of God of War, but it's done so differently here that the comparisons are moot.While I'd love to say I know how the story ends, I actually haven't been able to complete the game yet. That's how long Valhalla is. I've tried to get through it as fast as possible for this review, taking some detours to increase my power through raids and side objectives and whatnot, and even after 40 hours the end isn't in sight. That's a good thing for some people, but a big problem for others. Assassin's Creed Valhalla may have gotten rid of the bloat from side quests that plagued Odyssey, but it's no less full of cthings to do.Assassin's Creed Valhalla brought back two beloved features in the franchise: one hit assassinations with the hidden blade and social stealth, and it's all the better for it. Assassinations have been a staple of the franchise since its inception, so to see it slowly disappear from the series the past few years was disappointing.Assassin's Creed Valhalla brought back two beloved features in the franchise.To make these assassinations less overpowered, you now have to unlock an ability in your skill tree that allows you to kill any enemy by completing a quick time event if they would be too powerful to one-hit kill otherwise.Combat is now more varied with the addition of new enemy types that change the way you approach battle. I tended to default to my hack and slash method of swinging my axes to brute force my way through enemies, but I couldn't do that all of the time. Enemies with large spears will throw them at you, knocking you down from afar and leaving you vulnerable to other attacks. Heavy brutes might swing maces, so you need to wait for an opening and strike quickly. When other enemies have an unbreakable shield, you'll need perfect timing to dodge out of the way and deal a blow from behind.As for its raids, those range from interesting and fun to very underwhelming. The best raids are the castle assaults you'll complete at the end of a territory arc because they usually require specific objectives to beat. The regular raids found throughout the world are just some heavily guarded monasteries and other areas where you'll need to clear out the guards and open a few chests with the help of your raiding party.Raids range from interesting to underwhelming.Your raiding party will also sail with you on your longship, which I found myself never using more than I needed to for missions. Without naval combat, the only incentive to use your longship is quicker travel, and I found it was just more fun to use my mount to cross the country, especially when I could run into world events and other hidden treasures. You can't escape raiding though when you need resources to upgrade your settlement. By upgrading your settlement you'll unlock new missions and gain access to different activities, like fishing. I didn't find the settlement system to be anything special, but I did like having a home base I could come back to if I wanted to upgrade my gear and rest between main missions.Try as Valhalla might, its attempt to forgo a traditional levelling system in favor of ""power"" doesn't work as I believe it intended to. Territories are now labelled with a recommended power level for Eivor. If you're only around 90, you don't want to be travelling to a territory with a power level of 160. It's a soft ""level gating"" that keeps the story and gameplay mostly linear. You're technically free to explore England to your heart's content, but you probably shouldn't. I would have much rather seen Valhalla do away with power/level systems entirely or have it so that enemies scale to your power to an extent.Even though I don't think the power system did enough to fix the inherent issues in effectively soft level gating territories, I do like how it changes the skill tree and affects your gear. Your skill tree now diverges into three branches: Wolf, Raven, and Bear. The more you invest in one branch, the more you can improve gear aligned to that same animal. For instance, because I'm equipped with all Raven-aligned gear, I get bonuses by investing more heavily in that branch.Valhalla also drastically reduces the number of weapons and armor you'll find throughout the world, favoring upgrading, which can help make weapons unique instead of relying on levels to denote their worth. It's quality over quantity. The current axe I'm using right now happens to be the one I started the game with. I've been able to upgrade it enough that it's better than any other weapon I've come across. This holds true for any piece of gear you find. It'll never become obsolete so long as you upgrade it with the right resources.I said this in my earlier preview of Assassin's Creed Valhalla, but the game itself runs a bit rough. There's frequent screen tearing, visual glitches, animations clipping through one another — if there's a visual issue, it likely came up. Some of these are about what you'd expect if you've played Origins and Odyssey, but they felt more prevalent in Valhalla. At one point I needed to restart a mission because Eivor froze mid-air when I was trying to jump onto a ladder. I ran into other issues as well, but those were fixed in an update.Regardless, I still wouldn't say any of these made the game unplayable. It's not like it crashed on me or stopped working or anything like that, but these annoyances popped up time and time again to rear their ugly heads.Because I played on an Xbox One X, it's hard to say if some of these issues will persist on Xbox Series X or PS5. I'm inclined to believe at the very least there won't be as many visual glitches, but that may be wishful thinking on my part.Assassin's Creed Valhalla combines the best aspects of the franchise into a saga that may be too long for its own good. Little changes like the hidden blade assassinations, social stealth, and a new power system go a long way to revitalizing its gameplay, but I'm not sure that's enough for some people.Despite some pitfalls, Valhalla is a strong game with plenty to enjoy. It features a beautiful world to explore, interesting mythos, and engaging combat to keep you on your toes. If you were looking forward to Assassin's Creed Valhalla based on everything you've seen leading up to its release, I don't think you'll be disappointed._Assassin's Creed Valhalla will release on Nov. 10, 2020 on Xbox One, PS4, PC, and Stadia.

Assassin's Creed Valhalla,Rob Larkin,Gaming Nexus,https://www.gamingnexus.com/Article/6211/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla/,"The Assassin's Creed franchise is one of my more beloved series of games. I was floored by the first game: the innovative gameplay, the incredible representation of the Middle East in the Crusader era, even the way plot interwove between past and present felt so fresh. It was such an exhilarating gaming experience. That first time you wind through a crowd, stalking your prey, clamor up to a vantage point and time your strike, and soar through the air and pull off an aerial takedown of a Templar target; there are few moments in all of video games that stand out so breathtakingly.Assassin's Creed II came alone and basically did everything from the first even better. The few warts the freshman effort did have were airbrushed out of existence by the second. It also introduced an exciting new multiplayer unlike any other game on the market and raised the ante of the plot and locale with the intrigue and intimacy of the narrow avenues of Renaissance Italy. The game kept moving from strength to strength from there, even if it did forget how to count with AC III coming three sequels after II. Not everything it tried to pull off was done perfectly, some of it wasn't even a good idea (*cough cough* Den Defense), but the core loop of running and knifing as a member of a loyal brotherhood pitted against its eternal enemies across time and the globe was always a treat, a highlight of the gaming calendar. Five major games in to the series, and a few mobile offerings on the side, we finally hit Assassins Creed III, thoroughly concluding and wrapping up the franchise's plot lines both past and present. The gameplay is still satisfying and fresh, and Revolutionary America presents an outstanding backdrop to continue to embrace new elements, notably the open world of the rugged colonial wilderness and, even more importantly, the sea. It is after AC III that the game itself kind of stands on the precipice. It's unclear where to take it from here. It's unclear whether it even should be taken anywhere. Yet, the game was the most pre-ordered in Ubisoft history, and had sold over 12 million copies within a few months after release. So of course a sequel would be incoming, and it would be both the best and worst thing all at once.Because in Assassins Creed IV: Black Flag we got both what was probably the single best game of the entire franchise, and at the same time we completely lost our way with plot and gameplay. While the sea was just a minor element in III, Black Flag embraced it as a core mechanic. Not just the gameplay, but constructed the whole theme and feel of the world around sea shanties, naval battles, and even whaling as a mini-game. And while the game overall was a triumph, what went out the window were the core elements of the Assassins Brotherhood itself. Narratively, no longer was years of devoted training required to reach the technical skill of an elite Assassin. Apparently now all you have to do is chase down an existing brother while half starved on a deserted island and knick his little knifey thingy. We threw reason out the window so we could helm a frigate and shoot cannons. It was worth it for the sheer joy Black Flag gave us, but it set a dangerous precedent. Seven years later, these precedents of III and Black Flag, the open world and the departure from any semblance of grounded narratives, have come home to roost in Assassin's Creed Valhalla. We've traded our Jackdaw for longboats, and expanded the Nordic fjords and English countryside to epic proportions, but I can't help but wonder if we lost our Assassins in the exchange. Valhalla tries desperately to toe the line in between a classic Ubisoft open world game and the next iteration in the Assassin's Creed franchise, but there are many ways those two ideals are at odds with each other. Narratively it doesn't make a lot of sense. Early on in the prologue our protagonist, Eivor Wolf Kissed of the Raven Clan, meets up with two of the Assassins Brotherhood and they gift him a hidden blade. He (or she depending on whether you chose an interchangeable Male or Female Eivor) spins it around to the outside of the forearm, brashly proclaiming he has no intention of hiding such a magnificent gift. The Brotherhoods are a subtle group, operating in the shadows across time. Vikings are not subtle characters, yet somehow can effortlessly transition to master assassin with a gift and an offhanded lesson here or there. Much of the rest of the plot is spent shoehorning an Assassin's backdrop behind a very Viking foreground. I didn't find the recipe very convincing. A few hours into the game the Prologue concludes with Eivor and his brother, the trusted leader of the clan, off to England to raid their way into their own fortunes. On the front foot the game is nearly all Viking with an assassin's blade as his wrist. As the plot progresses, the Assassins and especially their eternal rivals, the Templars, grow more and more into focus. However, by the time the Assassin'ing really picked up, I was already entrenched in my disappointment at the ways it had affected the Viking'ing.United by a common enemy or not, the game still spends the majority of the time feeling like an open world Viking game, and it's a good time. The focus is on exploration, raiding, settlement building, forging alliances, and dipping into the mythic lore of the Norse. The game never really diverges from its foundation as a historical sim, as much as it desperately wants to embrace the supernatural. Psychotropics and classic tie ins to the Assassin's Creed canon of gods and angels try and explain away the less reality-based portions of the tale, but throughout you can tell where the game cries out to break free.There are some obvious tributes throughout the game world from the Vikings television series but even more so I thought from the BBC series The Last Kingdom. But in game play I kept feeling this homage to God of War, only confined to doing so with the restrictor plates on. Maybe I was biased when the first time I picked up what essentially is a special ability, it was an axe throw—something you spend more than half the game in God of War executing. But I couldn't quite shake that God of War feeling because, simply, the best parts of the combat, that range of special abilities that can be mapped to certain button combos and need a recharge to perform just felt so Kratos-esque. While the main combat play is a little clunky—you mostly dodge, black, counter, light strike, heavy strike—the special moves are the facet that really starts to open things up. But here is where the mismatch of the raiding, warring, rooting tooting Viking and cold, calculated, shadows of the Assassin spanning space-time who needs to uncover the hidden secrets of every last corner start to wear at the seams binding the two. To unlock these special Viking combat abilities we must first test the exploration of the Assassin, as they are all hidden away in collectibles: books at the bottom of some dungeon or behind some locked door. It feels like a missed opportunity for the normal progression of the Viking. We do not learn or level up our abilities through the skill tree or some other Viking method, they exist to be found about in the world of the Assassins collectibles. There is a skill tree, but it widely is used to raise stats like attack and defense and unlock more passive abilities, not change the nature of combat. The end result of the overall combat system is satisfying, even if I do miss the high-flying exploits of Assassins past.There are times it shows its warts like when storming a fortress: caught in the middle of an epic battle, tearing down the ramparts and barging in the gates, you run head first into a thrall of soldiers guarding the inner courts only to be engaged, calmly, one at a time, as they rotate through their challenges only after you've dispatched the last. It's not so much the combat that is lacking as it is the singular nature of the way the AI engages. It's like the SNL skit where all the ninjas talk about how, instead of attacking Bruce Lee one at time, maybe they should try all attacking at once. Same logic applies. But then the lack of fluidity in combat, and more importantly the mostly unnecessary stamina meter that limits fluidity would be put to the breaking point. Combat ends up functional and enjoyable, but much like the mysticism of the plot lines seems to lose something trying to hard to tether it to a reality with stamina and limitations on a more free-flowing dance like the Batman Arkham series enjoys. There are also plenty of noticeable quality of life improvements throughout the game. Horses, longboats, and all the trappings that make the world easier to traverse are themselves easy enough to wield. And where they aren't, like in docking a ship or trekking a long distance, they have buttons mapped to automate the deed. A long press of triangle when near that dock will snuggle it right up alongside. A long press of square sets your steed or ship on its way to automatically follow the road or channel, and a long press of triangle will even self-navigate it to whatever is marked on your map screen as the destination point. If you need to get from point A to point B, either there is a fast travel option or the game will not make that a slog for you, unless you really want to chance getting lost in points C, D, E, and F along the way, and often you will. So much of the core of the game is this world-building epic Viking tale, and oh what a wonderful world there is to tell it. Ubisoft has been doing open world games for a while now, and this is as fine an example of their expertise in the arena as any. The locales heave with the breath of life. The fog rolls in over the squidgy swamps. Ruins of a forgotten Roman past dot the landscape and tower above the trees. Churches, farms, settlements, and even cities build out the population and fill up the whole thing with character and storytelling in the many, many side quests and tasks to engage in or ignore. Wildlife teems in abundance. But because we still have to inject some assassin'ing in there to earn use of the title, we can't really stretch our legs and let loose going full Viking in this playground.But whereas the way the Viking world is tethered to that of the assassin, and is unable to let loose; the assassin world is also burdened by this expansive, beautiful, yet ultimately restrictive open world. For me, the key elements of the assassin part of the game requires the density of cities as its playground. That's why Venice and Rome and Milan and Istanbul made for such iconic locations. They combined historic landmarks you can visit to this day and be inspired by the recreation both in and out of the game; but also race along the rafters above the marketplaces and chase down your mark to finally ascend down with that epic killing blow. So much of the part of Viking raider pits you as a stranger in a strange open land, unwelcome and out of place in the few locations where you can really let your assassin flag fly.  There are other ways these two worlds mix like oil and water. For example, the game is littered with exploding barrels, the tropiest of gaming tropes to begin with, and they stand out as one hit kill boxes of pure frustration. This is never more prevalent than in one of the earliest missions, a raid on a fishing village, where you have to burn down supply wagons. Each wagon is bordered by both exploding barrels and enemies. So if choose to go Viking and actually engage the enemy, prepare to die over and over again as stray arrows from friend or foe absentmindedly strike the barrels. If the explosion didn't obliterate you, the fire that engulfs your body surely will in mere seconds. It's like a Sisyphean trap, an endless loop of burning away and giving you one open world, but forcing you into one path to complete the task because of the limitations placed when the other world collides, because why on earth do we even need exploding barrels in this Viking world? Well, because the AC open world begs for exploration puzzles and collectibles that don't really add anything to the Viking experience. But in this AC world, we need to tear down destructible walls and only an exploding barrel trope will do. Speaking of collectibles, the narrative weight of the Viking experience takes a hit as it freely allows you to jaunt back and forth between Norway and England, lest players get locked out of trophies for progressing too far too fast. Weighty decisions to move the plot forward have no real consequences when I can fast travel back to the fjords to pick up a missing flying piece of paper. This busywork is all well and good when placed in terms of glitches in the AC matrix, but is another data point picking at the seams of the Viking life.To be fair, these are only moments where the clash becomes a head on collision. Incidents that stand out, but that are only fleeting when compared to the normative experience of raiding and running missions and exploring. The vast majority of the playtime is not spent in frustrating loops, but in enjoyable gameplay, in options to push the main story or get lost in endless side quests, in that choice between following the marker point on the map or dallying off into so many distractions that might uncover any of a number of treasures in gear, supplies, or even storytelling. And so the story goes, two games sharing one space, often at odds with each other, up until the point where you are pulled forward to the present day bits because apparently we still have to do that in Assassin's Creed games. Look, it’s not just that the present/near-future day interludes in between main story chapters are boring and badly paced, they’re poorly acted and shot too. No one plays this game to jump into a walking simulator when the modern blokes we all stopped caring about many sequels ago jump out of their VR tanning booths. We've wrapped up the Assassin's Creed present and near-future plot lines in previous games haven't we? Continuing to dip into that well is unnecessary. Why not just drop those sections entirely, add a little voiceover for continuity, and embrace what makes the games great—not keep trying to force feed plot lines that have nothing to do with 99% of the game and that I can't imagine anyone is still paying attention to. I would rather play Abstergo Creed where we are just randoms walking into a VR amusement park to connect with past lives than have to sit through any more of these side plots that just serve as MacGuffins to give us an excuse to connect to past lives.  I'm not trying to detract from the whole package of Assassins Creed Valhalla. This is still a good game, but it is only good and not great because it borders on the edges of two better games that are at odds with one another. This worked in Black Flag because I rolled my eyes at the inane plot and was having too much fun on the Jackdaw and in the multiplayer to care. But in Valhalla, there is no multiplayer and the clash can't be papered over because of the way this wide open England creates too much space for the Assassin to flourish and the tenants of the Assassin keep limiting they way the Viking could conquer. However, when the Viking is conquering and the Assassin does find those spaces to perch, each presents itself well and leads to some exhilarating stretches of play in an immense and beautiful playground. There is so much to do here between the main plot, the many side quests, and all of the nooks and crannies to explore. The path is well laid out and you're never without options to pursue and choose to pursue at your own pace and discretion. There is so much the game does well and does right and that cannot be lost in this review. I just think the restrictions the game places on itself by trying to do too many things in one package prevents it from fully realizing its own potential. * The product in this article was sent to us by the developer/company. First picked up a game controller when my mother bought an Atari 2600 for my brother and I one fateful Christmas.   Now I'm a Software Developer in my day job who is happy to be a part of the Gaming Nexus team so I can have at least a flimsy excuse for my wife as to why I need to get those 15 more minutes of game time in...

Assassin's Creed Valhalla,Michael Harradence,PlayStation Universe,https://www.psu.com/reviews/assassins-creed-valhalla-review-ps5-the-definitive-way-to-experience-this-viking-epic/," Michael Harradence / November 24, 2020Assassin’s Creed Valhalla PS5 Review – Having spent dozens of hours immersed in Ubisoft‘s Viking simulator on the PS4, I was immediately impressed by just how stunning the game looks and runs on the PS5. While it’s not quite the massive overhaul that some other titles have received, the added horsepower afforded by Sony’s bulky telly box makes this without a doubt the definitive version of Assassin’s Creed Valhalla. Be sure to read our Assassin’s Creed Valhalla PS4 review to get a better idea of the overall game itself.Related Content: Sony PlayStation 5 – The Full Hardware ReviewFirst off, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is a breathtakingly gorgeous game at times, as was the case on the PS4 anyway. In fact, it’s a testament to the current-generation version of the game’s graphics when I found it hard to really notice any standout advantages of the PS5 version. The fact is, Valhalla looks gorgeous on either platform.Still, the sharper 4K resolution (whether that’s upscaled or native, we don’t actually know, but honestly, I’m not fussed at all) gives the game a polished shine that accentuates the already jaw-dropping vistas and impressive water effects as you soak up Dark Ages England.As mentioned in my initial review, the characters aren’t anything special, but it’s the environments that really standout; indeed, PS5’s extra technical muscle only further cements this opinion.One of the most egregious issues of the PS4 version of Assassin’s Creed Valhalla was the load times. Whether it be booting up the game, using the fast travel function to navigating menus, load times were pretty bad, and this is something that the PS5’s SSD has rectified.Firing up the game is now considerably faster and you won’t be forced to muck about in the loading screen for ages, while fast travelling to locations across the map is quicker too, ensuring you can get to where you need to go pretty sharpish. Menus are almost-instant, too. All of this makes for a much more seamless and enjoyable experience, as the loading screens aren’t anywhere near as intrusive or tiresome as on PS4.To be more specific, booting my save file on the PS4 version takes about 45 seconds until you’re actually able to get into the action. On PS5, this takes just 20 seconds. Meanwhile, using fast travel on PS4 resulted in 50 seconds of loading time, whereas on PS5, it makes you wait just 25 seconds – impressive stuff.Another obvious advantage of the PS5 version of Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is the frame rate, which runs at a buttery-smooth 60 FPS. This isn’t just limited to when you’re walking around or sailing on your longboat; the increased frame rate remains steady even during heated bouts of combat, such as during raids or in crowded towns and settlements.As such, battles feel far smoother and at times more responsive, with every swing of your axe and shield block executed with precise, fluid motion. Travelling is also infinitely more enjoyable as you glide over glistening waters or soak up England’s sumptuous countrysides on horseback. The best bit? I didn’t see any major signs of slowdown during my time with the PS5 version.Crucially, the next-generation version of the game removes many of the bugs seen in the PS4 version. I encountered no instances of getting stuck on the scenery, annoying glitches, or times where soldiers would stand still in one spot and pivot like a ballerina. Yes, really, that happened on PS4.That’s not to say there are no technical hiccups left, but it’s such a marked improvement over the PS4 version that it makes the game more enjoyable and keeps you immersed in the experience.Overall, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is best enjoyed on the PS5. Any remaining niggles I have with the game aren’t related to the performance of the game on the console itself, but rather, are intrinsically linked to the core fundamentals of the game.Dodgy accents and some annoyances with grinding aside, this is the definitive version of Ubisoft’s Viking opus and a must-have for Assassin’s Creed fans.Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is now available for PS5.Review code provided by publisher.Assassin's Creed Valhalla on PS5 is the definitive version of Ubisoft's epic Viking title. With a sharper resolution, silky-smooth frame rate and a reduced number of bugs and glitches, Sony's new console offers a more seamless and enjoyable platform to experience this mammoth, engrossing open-world game on.

Assassin's Creed Valhalla,Robert Ramsey,Push Square,http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/assassins_creed_valhalla,"GuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpAssassin's Creed Valhalla2020 7.4Game RatingUser Ratings: 637Our Review: Scroll DownThe raven's callVersion Reviewed: EuropeanAssassin's Creed Valhalla was a disappointment on PS4. Plagued by a constant and unending stream of bugs, an otherwise great open world adventure was held back on Sony's last-gen console. Thank the Norse gods for PS5, then. The new system improves Valhalla massively, to the point where we could actually sit back and enjoy the game's intriguing storylines without having to worry about characters falling through the ground at random.In this review, we'll be highlighting how Ubisoft's latest runs on PS5. If you're looking for a more in-depth analysis of gameplay systems and mechanics, be sure to check out our Assassin's Creed Valhalla PS4 review.Right, first thing's first: Valhalla looks fantastic on PS5. The lighting, the visual effects, the colours — everything looks more vibrant and detailed. It also runs at a silky 60 frames-per-second, giving the entire experience a smoothness that greatly benefits playability. Combat — though still a little bit rigid — feels so much better. Other actions, like climbing and even taking part in drinking contests, feel way more responsive.And then there are the load times — or lack thereof. Valhalla often took over a full minute and a half to load a save, or fast travel to a completely different location. On PS5, loading your progress from the main menu takes about seven seconds. It's a jarring improvement. We had gotten used to getting a drink or checking our emails while waiting for Valhalla to load — now we barely have the time to take a bite from a biscuit.It's not just the more obvious load screens that fall to the power of the PS5, either. When striking up a conversation with a character, Valhalla would sometimes cut to a black screen on PS4, as if the game was trying to keep up. On PS5, all of these little interactions are instant, as are the transitions between gameplay and cutscene. It's a truly seamless open world on the current-gen machine.But what about the bugs? Well, we're delighted to report that the experience is nowhere near as buggy on PS5. You literally couldn't go ten seconds without seeing some kind of visual cock-up on PS4, but here, you'll get the odd wonky animation and that's about it. To be clear, Valhalla isn't bug-free on PS5, but it's still an immense improvement.The bottom line here is that it's now far easier to become immersed in what is a very good open world RPG. Ubisoft's recreation of 9th Century England is, at its best, quite breathtaking. When the lighting's just right and you look up to see the fields, forests, and mountains stretching on forever, it's easily one of the most striking open worlds in gaming.And visuals are important when you're spending over 100 hours with your Viking pals. Valhalla's map may not be as colossal as the whole of ancient Greece in Assassin's Creed Odyssey, but it's the incredibly long main story that demands so much of your time. It's a gigantic game, but at least it'll keep you busy throughout the PS5's launch period.As we wrote in our PS4 review, Valhalla's structure is what sets it apart from its immediate predecessors. Yes, it still boasts an open world that's packed with side quests and optional activities, but the emphasis on main story missions — spread out across numerous Norse and Saxon kingdoms — gives the game a kind of focus that Origins and Odyssey, in all of their bloat, simply didn't have. Most importantly, this allows the game's wider cast to actually make an impression. In both its writing and its storytelling, Valhalla is a clear cut above what's come before.Assassin's Creed Valhalla really comes together on PS5. Near instant load times combined with silky smooth performance make it a joyous open world excursion, complete with an engrossing main story. What's more, the countless bugs that plagued the PS4 version of the game have, for the most part, been squashed. This is Ubisoft's best ever attempt at an open world RPG in the vein of something like The Witcher 3, and while it is still a little rough around the edges, Valhalla leaves its mark as a top tier entry in the Assassin's Creed series.Great 8/10Scoring PolicyReview copy provided by UbisoftPlease note that some external links on this page are affiliate links, which means if you click them and make a purchase we may receive a small percentage of the sale.

When he's not practising combos, he's usually getting lost in the latest 100-hour RPG, or, y'know, replaying The Witcher 3.Comments (67)Well I've never played an Assassin's Creed game in my life, so I might check this out.Sounds good to me, look at how many games there were with crap last-gen ports in previous gens so there was bound to be a few this time round! Perhaps once I finish Unity, Syndicate, Origins and Odyssey, I’ll have a PS5 by that point!@HotGoomba___Rebrand Really?  Picking this up on Wednesday, can't wait to travel across England in 4K, 60fps!After 30+ hours this is my least favorite Assassins Creed game@shogunrok. Would you say the UI feels outdated compared to ghost of tsushima which i really think set the benchmark for this kind of experience.Great review, and i am really excited to play if i get it for Christmas. Although i will probably still be getting killed on loop on demons souls by thenIt's so damn buggy on PS4 that I've stopped playing. I might redownload on PS5 when I get one next year!Can't speak for the ps4 version but I've seen alot of bugs in the ps5 version. I've had to restart 3 missions because of various glitches. Don't get me wrong, it's absolutely fantastic but I'm gonna wait until it's patched up a bit more.I'm still playing odyssey (almost platted) and i just bought origins on the black friday sale..will buy this for the ps5 when i get my console...soon i hope.@Rob_230 Maybe a little. It opts for that kind of Destiny-style cursor-based UI, but it's a bit messy. I agree that Ghost's UI is really nice and clean, but then it doesn't have quite as much to keep track of.If anyone's got any questions about the game or the review, just let me know and I'll try to answer.If you're looking for more in-depth criticism of the gameplay and story, definitely check out the PS4 review we did: https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/assassins_creed_valhalla@ShogunRok thanks Rob. That sounds like a fair response. Ahh well, not long till i can try it out for myself 🙂 thanks again!@ShogunRok Good review!How are the raids? Are you actually plundering settlement and murdering the people on it (you know, ransacking the churches and clergy for valuables), or does to dial back the Vikings when it comes to killing innocent people?@HotGoomba___Rebrand I highly recommend the Ezio trilogy, Black Flag and Unity to start with@stefan771 I actually enjoyed III more than Black Flag going through them recently. Rogue’s been way better than I expected as well.The light is a bit all over the place for me and a lot of England has this haze to it where things look washed out at times and others super vibrant. Game is beautiful though. Most of this is just minor nitpicks from me.It's going to be a while until I get my hands on a PS5 so was tempted to treat myself to this for Christmas but what with the PS4 version being so buggy and only having finished Odyssey (a game that didn't actually have that many bugs all things considered) in June I guess I'll have to go for something else instead.Thinking Final Fantasy VII and/or Ghost of Tsushima. How do both games run on a base PS4?N.i.c.e. assassins creed is always good.another game to the collection.word up sonI liked the game and the world and building my own base camp, stories were ok. Hated the combat wich until about 20 hours in is boring and tedious, outfits were uninspiring and a bit samey. Overall a bit of a step down from Odyssey. 7/10 imo.@Col_McCafferty I wish u a buggy Christmas lol. But yh wait for the PS5 for Valhalla. Tried to play it on PS4 Pro in bedroom and its a nightmare constant crashes, Bugs galore, Loading times make Bloodbourne look good. PS5 version is night and day mate.@Col_McCafferty I played the first 3 or 4 chapters of Final Fantasy VII on the base PS4 and it ran perfectly fine, in fact I didn't actually notice much difference when going onto the Pro version.According to business insider:""One UK-based group named CrepChiefNotify(a scalping group) managed to snag just under 3500 PS5 units across its members and pre-orders, giving it stock that not even major online retailers can currently compete with..""Loving every minute of it. Both me and my son, who watched me platinum Odyssey, were excited to see the tie in with the last game. Love that continuity.Loving it so far. The combat's a bit weird, though. They tried a bit more of a Dark Souls lite direction with Odyssey, especially as seen in R1 and R2 being attack, but still had the really easy parries from previous ACs. In this one they've tried to go for a more limited parry and have added a stamina meter that goes down from various things (though not running, thank god) so it's even more DS-like now. That said, I find it confusing why parries don't seem to work sometimes and enemies seem to randomly get hyper armour and ignore your attacks. At least they seem to have stopped putting in enemies that takes about 50 hits to kill. I do find it oddly hard, though. I died 3 times to the first boss - that means I've died more times to that one fight than I have in several hours of Demon's Souls.picked up the PS4 version for £40, hopefully can get the free upgrade working, might play this before Cyberpunk@Jaz007 You actually auto-fail missions if you kill 3 innocent people. It's a bit weird since it's not like as soon as someone picks up a weapon to defend themselves they become morally okay to kill. It's even more strange when you consider you could kill everyone apart from kids in Odyssey. I'd stand on rooftops and throw torches at people to set them on fire. I piled up peasant corpses in fountains. Yet now I'm a viking I can't throw a cheeky axe at a monk?@Matroska be cool for a AC game to have a good or evil path. It is the perfect game for that.Good to hear! I'll pick it up sometime early in the new year, hopefully patched up and a wee cheaper.never been AC fan so I cant really comment, but to me, it looks like same old UbiSoft *****. Seems a lot repetitive. Basing this on what I see on Twitch and also from me playin The Division. No thanks. No time for this bollocks.@Col_McCafferty both ghost and FF7 ran perfectly on a base ps4 for me. The console got quite noisy though so i would recommend headphones.I had a few texture issues on FF7, but it was rare and the internet blew it out of proportion. Game may have been patched since tooLoving it. Took a break to finish Miles Morales. But got back into it pretty easily. Keep doing one last thing before bed - never ends well the next morning for work.Ubi is on a roll with AC. I now have hope for FarCry next year.@parvaz1 Same here I have never played any AC game, there are so many now that at this point it would be a waste of time to jump in. I do hope everyone that likes the series is enjoying this one ✌️How does it compare to the tv show Vikings? If it contains brutal fights and sloothy women, I'm in.I have Valhalla already installed but I'm not starting it before I'm done with Spider-Men And by done I mean platinum trophies Glad to hear it's not nearly as buggy as the PS4 version!@Matroska Yeah, that is weird. Vikings weren't so nice as to auto-fail if they killed three monks when raiding a monastery. Like, we're a Viking more than anything else, let go of the random animus restriction. They should have taken a page out of the train robberies and money lending missions in RDR2, just with more killing and less redemption. Especially since we already have choices and consequences, why not let us decide how to brutal the raids are? it's simple history.@Jaz007 Yeah it's like @Matroska said. Raiding and pillaging monasteries is a big part of the game, but the game doesn't like you killing innocents. It's perfectly fine to take their belongings, burn their homes to the ground, and slaughter all of their livestock, though!The game tries hard to paint vikings in a more positive light than most other media. And while it does kind of work — you get a decent amount of insight into some viking customs and beliefs — it's not exactly accurate to history.That said, there are times when Eivor feels like the lesser of two evils, rather than being a straight-up hero. For a lot of the story, he/she is quite aggressive and will do anything for the betterment of the clan — even if it means manipulating people or forcing them into submission.But yeah, bottom line is it's still a bit weird to be playing as an often ruthless viking clan and then being told ""hey, if you kill one more peasant, it's game over!""I'll most likely get this on PS5 when/if I manage to get one soon.Who's better acted, male Eivor or female Eivor and are they worthy enough to polish Kassandra's spartan boots?Game needs optimization badly. Running smoothly on next gen consoles and only top tier pcs is bs.Now they just need to get the upgrade from PS4 to PS5 working.@ApostateMage I tried both and honestly, I think male Eivor is way more nuanced and nice to listen to. It's obviously personal preference, but I'm really not a fan of how female Eivor sounds. You can swap between them at will, though, so you can always experiment.And I think Eivor is definitely up there with Alexios/Kassandra. Eivor's not quite as jolly (the game in general isn't anywhere near as jolly!), but he/she has more emotional depth, I think.Ubi has done a great job here with a high resolution at 60fps. The game runs very well and is a great sign of things to come. If Ubi can do 4k (dynamic, but super close most of the time) at a solid 60fps, with such a massive game, other developers have no excuse.A note to Push Square: it may be a good idea to paste in the parts of the reviews going forward for cross gen titles that are not distinct to the PS4/PS5. I think when people search for Assassins Creed Valhalla PS5 review, they are not going to want to read two full reviews to get your full take on things. Just a thought.Its a buggy broken mess,the quest right at the beginning of the game when you get given a certain item is broken I had to reload a previous save 3 times before it decided to run its course,I've had floating heads,a ghost crew where the oars where moving by themselves and various other annoyances, the hdr is messed up and I have had to make a profile on my TV just for this game,the main character is poorly textured compared to the one on the inventory screen so much so its quite jarring and the skill tree looks amateurish and cluttered compared to other games of this series,I've put it back in its box until ubisoft fix it as it has the makings of a good game its a shame half of it looks rushed,oh well back to demons souls.@Deadhunter @Medic_Alert Same plan here! Hoping to see Valhalla Gold/Complete be priced at $30 or cheaper by Black Friday 2021...so I can wait until BF 2022-2023 to pick it up for $15-$20 lol.@HotGoomba___Rebrand If you played one every 3 years you have played them all.Thanks the the PS5's new 'time played' details I can confirm this is the first AC game I've managed to play more than a couple of hours. That should be put on their marketing.....""Finally played for more than a few hours and didn't delete it - StonyK""This might just be my first AC since revelations. I'm happy about the focus on main quests and less filler.But as with all Ubisoft Games, wait a few weeks and it'll be flooding the bargain bins and 2nd hand shops. By then most all bugs will be ironed out as well. Not playing full price to beta test.Over 40 hours in the game and besides a few textures pop, I have not found much bugs on ps4-pro. Story is not the greatest and i have played all parts the series but it has some good moments. It's a fun game. Only dislike I have is how far away from the 'assassin' part the series is drifting.The game seems good, interested in this when I have ps5 early next year 😃I started the game on hard and the combat definitely does take getting used to. Barely an hour in so far and have died multiple times, 2 hits from a boss and you're done. I need to get gud. 😳I'm in no way a programmer, so please take this in the spirit of interested curiosity it's meant. I thought bugs were a programming issue and nothing to do with the available power? I'm not getting many bugs on my PS4, but I know it's had a few patches, so I thought that the reason.Well I have started it about 8hrs in and just arrived in England. finding it a bit hard to get into so far don't know why. Combat seems a bit weird atm. It does look nice though, going to keep playing it today and hopefully something clicks and can get into it. Loved origins and odyssey so don't know why I can't get into this was really looking forward to it. Hopefully it clicks today otherwise might wait a bit and play something else and come back to it another time.Also I dont know if it's just me/ this gets easier as I get used to the game but I really struggle to identify health bushes and other point of interest. Unless they are really obvious like wealth.And that's even after using Odin's sight.@HotGoomba___Rebrand Same.. new to the series myself. Not sure i want to dive in at this price point with risk of not liking it. I wish there was a demo to try first before i buy.I will get it when i get my PS5 then it probably has a nice pricedrop.In own pretty much all AC games bar the first. I liked Origins and Odyssey but I think this is showing its age now and in need of another refresh.Odyssey was for me personally far too big and I still have a lot to do.I’d have been more likely to pay £10 for a next gen patch for that game, than £60 for Valhalla.If I pick this up, it will be for “free” as part of Ubisoft’s version of Gamepass on PC. Sooner that service is rolled out to console the better.Combat takes a while to get going? weird I thought it was great from the get go. Mentor armor, Fafnir/Fyrd spear, Poison build for the win!@JapaneseSonic Assassin Creed games are mostly whatever genre of history you like. If you like anything to do with Vikings you'll love this. Odyssey was a great one as well but I never beat it. IMO Valhalla by far is the best AC.@JapaneseSonic yea I do like the long games, just been playing a bit more now, it's starting to click I think. Norway was a bit bland nothing much there England seems a lot better and building base looks good. So hopefully get into it properly now.Enjoying this so far, got mine of shopto for £48.No bugs or issues, but is the controller light supposed to be off in game?@JapaneseSonic no doubt, now just waiting for Cyberpunk XDI am years behind on Assassins Creed. I was so excited about the first game and found it to be a massive disappointment, so I never really looked at any of the sequels, until Assassins Creed III of all things came out, and for some reason I was really interested in the TV commercial footage of it.So I went back to catch up, but the problem was I've never really wanted to play more than 1 a year and get series fatigue. I finally made it to Black Flag last Christmas, but decided to skip over Unity and Syndicate and just started Origins. Wow! This is the game I imagined the first one being. For the first time ever, I feel like it can be a proper stealth game.If we think of Valhalla as this gen's black flag, I hope we don't get the sort of flawed gems that are Unity and Syndicate that we got last time before the 'real' next gen games came with Origins and Odyssey.I found it really hard to get into this time round, but I think it's more to do with completely falling in love with Kassandra who was a snarky beyotch. Eivor is a lot more subdued to me. Also playing as male this time round as the female character seemed a little bland to me this time round. I've done three areas in England and starting to really enjoy it now. Wanted to romance Soma though and haven't been able to. Enjoying the fishing and hunting. Also love Sigurd a LOT, assumed he was going to be an a-hole so pleasently surprised by that.Anyone else think thier male Eivor looks completely different to the Eivor on the cover.Whoever wrote this review must be high.Don't think I can trust any more AC games. The last 2 are horribly boring.Very pretty, but typical tiresome open world stuff that gets boring quickly@HotGoomba___Rebrand great games odyssey, AC2 and blackflag my personal favsBest assassins creed since number 2 and its amazing on PS5.

Assassin's Creed Valhalla,Randy Kalista,Gaming Nexus,https://www.gamingnexus.com/Article/6203/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla/,"A blond-haired, blue-eyed Scandanavian is the man, the myth, and the legend behind Assassin’s Creed Valhalla. It’s Beowulf writ large. It’s Hulu’s Vikings TV Series: The Game. And, if I’m honest, it’s the only Assassin’s Creed I’ve really been waiting for since 2013’s Black Flag.After 13 years of the Assassin’s Creed series, it’s easy to forget that every Assassin’s Creed is somebody’s first Assassin’s Creed. So here’s the gist. If you want something more in-depth, you’ll have to consult a wiki, because I don't have the word count to explain it all. But it goes something like this: Since the real world of science fiction writers collectively decided in the early 21st century that “time travel is lame,” Ubisoft invented a time traveling concept which doesn’t technically use time travel. Instead, there is a modern day component and a historical component to each Assassin’s Creed video game, with two time periods literally strung together with DNA strands.In the modern day (or at least near future), there is a snarky hacktivist group that is bent on exposing the evils of a Google-like super corporation. That evil corporation is trying to acquire an ancient relic that will let them, I don't know, rule the world. The hacktivist group, on the other hand, is the balancing force preventing that from happening. There’s a device called the Animus which allows this not-time-travel to happen so that, in Valhalla, we get to visit Norway and England, torching the shire and looting churches in the 9th century. It's the early 870's AD—the year is only three digits long—which leaves plenty of artistic license for Ubisoft to play with.So, we good? All the sci-fi gobbledegook is window dressing. All the historical action-RPG stuff is the meat and potatoes of Assassin’s Creed. While the hacktivist-slash-super-corporation stuff is integral to the series, we’re here for the Vikings. And boy is there a lot of Viking stuff to do. More than you’d think.Because while it’s true that “history is written by the victors,” it appears the opposite was true for the Vikings in real life. The Scandinavian nations that began sailing west to England, conquering and settling (""pacifying"") portions of it, weren’t in the habit of writing much down while they were going about the business of conquering and settling. Instead, it was the conquered peoples of England, etc., that did most of the writing. Even back then, sex and violence sold well, so those are the stories that emerge out of the Age of Vikings for this Northern European people group.While Valhalla doesn’t say, “The Vikings did nothing wrong,” it certainly capitalizes on the narrative that raiding and pillaging was only a piece of the Nordic pie. In fact, in-game, I'm not even sure there's any benefit to lighting thatch-roofed huts on fire. It certainly recreates the Viking aesthetic, but it's not like you're racking up more experience points for smoking out the hamlets. Regardless, Valhalla attempts to fill in the other blanks of what we ultimately know of Viking culture and society.For instance, I came home in Norway, immediately lost a drinking contest, sat down for a bard’s tale, my head lolling to the side, mouth gaping open, as my blurry-eyed drunkard tried to ingest a strangely forgettable tale of Norse mythology. I then stepped into what I think was a Viking rap battle, basically, by “flyting” against another rhymer throwing disses at me—while I geared up to ruin this man’s whole career. Then I was rolling a weirdly complex game of dice against a gambler chilling outside the jarl’s hall. I relieved him of about 200 silver coins.Beginning right off in Valhalla, a daring rescue turns into a fitful tale of revenge. You play as Eivor, a male or female Viking that you can swap between at will throughout the story. Eivor is frustratingly handsome and/or beautiful. BroViking’s voice is smoky like beef jerky, while femViking tries too hard to use her Big Girl Voice. Forcing too much speech to come from the diaphragm doesn't mean female Eivor is a bad voice actor, but it made me opt for male Eivor more often than not. Either way, your tattoo choices, hair colors, and sick Assassin’s Creed-style weapons and armor have you looking formidable from the get go.Likewise, in top Assassin’s Creed form, the world is a wonder to behold. Sometimes you’ll ride off into a color-drained night, with even the moon a featureless monochrome in the sky, and the green drapes of the Northern Lights will hang down like a veil from the Milky Way. Sometimes you’ll ride over trackless hills in the snow, or follow a trail that is only one set of footprints going up, and one set of footprints coming back down. Those footprints might take you past a bull elk that tosses you 20 feet up into the air with the man-sized coat rack he’s got on top of his head. That might also be the first time you have to hit the reload button, too. By the way, push down on your D-pad and you’ll find the quicksave button hiding under there. Assassin's Creed can be something of a cake walk. That is, until you reach those intentional difficulty spikes lurking around the map.All the things that make this a very Assassin’s Creed game are here. You’ll see a sharply inclined peak with a single tree at the top and you’ll think to yourself: I know exactly what to do here. You’ll see a snowy bale of hay at the foot of a tower and you’ll instinctively make that leap of faith like it requires no faith at all. You'll see treasure icons pop up all over the cartography and not even have to be told to pop that lid and get that loot. And you'll bring all your gamepad's triggers and buttons to bear on your enemies' faces with an entire skill tree that branches outward like a sky chock full of constellations. It’s sad that such a signature move, the leap of faith, is taken for granted. I’m guilty of doing that, too. I’m trying to chase that parkour high in photo mode, and I can almost get there, but a circling camera and a hawk’s cry aren’t quite enough to stir the old Assassin’s bones in me that I know are there, lying dormant. I’m looking for Valhalla’s sleeping giant. The thing that refreshes this whole series for me in one deep breath. But I’m not finding it in those leaps. They lack the drop in my stomach they used to create.And another staple of the series, the wristblade assassinations, aren’t doing it either. Don’t get me wrong, I’ll yoink a dude into a pile of hay and shank him for breakfast. Or I’ll leap off the top turnbuckle and drive that shwing right into an Englishman’s neck. But it hits too softly here. You don’t feel the blade going in anymore. You just sort of float on top of an enemy, and your blade sort of floats into them. It’s a weird thing to get wrong in a game that’s been doing this for over a decade now. Both of those actions are crucial in Assassin's Creed gameplay. But in Valhalla, I'm unconvinced. I don't know if it's bad camera angles, a lack of camera shake, or slightly lagged sound effects, but none of it hits the way it should hit.The options menu is deep and wide. Teams upon teams of people put together accessibility options that I’m, admittedly, privileged enough to never really need. But the menus are likewise deep and wide for explorer-type gamers like myself. I count nearly 20 different individual pieces of the HUD that you can deactivate. I can turn every second of every minute of gameplay into a screenshot. It doesn’t matter what the save game file tells me, I know that probably half of my hours were spent in photo mode. Adjust the focus. Greater depth of field. Vignette the borders. Add some noise to the hyperactive number of pixels smoothing everything over. Being an in-game photographer while playing Assassin’s Creed is a blessing and a curse.The interminable gameplay loop is good, even when you’re just exploring, doing seemingly nothing at all. Fill your satchel with berries for rations. Take your axe to some iron ores that chime like Nirnroot. Climb to the top of a peak so sharp it looks like an advertisement for Ginsu knives. Trade war stories with a guy that’s got an axe stuck in his head. Pillage some lovers’ hut so they can get their kink on. Blow your goat horn and raid the local Hobbiton. Perch atop ancient Roman ruins for a lovely panoramic. Slap some leather and iron together to bolster your blade's stats.Pluck that bowstring, wield that hammer, beef up your ration bag, and yes, try out that two-shield fighting style you heard the developers talking about. Full Captain America times two. Then build up your settlement in England, constructing, among so many other shops and farms, an armor smithy to embolden your weapons loadout. But run with your tail tucked whenever a Crusader comes around. You’ll know what I’m talking about when the game suddenly turns into Dark Souls and all those killer finishing moves you’ve been perfecting suddenly don’t have a snowball’s chance in Helheim.The open world is indeed a wonderful work of art here, with sprawling English countryside and unforgivingly steep Norwegian fjords. This isn’t a one-to-one recreation of either, but Valhalla hits the high points of each, relying on historical documents and archeological digs to come up with a goodly portion of what's built here. Though it turns out, even after all their research—and by its own admission—Ubisoft is sometimes only accidentally correct in what it's rebuilt. But: fair enough. It’s been a few centuries. The historical record will only get you just so far when it comes to the Vikings, remember. And as much as my heart beats for this romanticized Viking romp, there are some things that didn’t feel right: not just the pillowy wristblade kills and floaty leaps of faith.There are inexplicable shifts in location during the opening chapters. Like raiding a village to the southwest with my brother, when the very next scene has us, without explanation, at a village to the northeast. I know that’s where the story wants to take me next, but there is a huge disconnect as to how I physically reached that point. Not sure why Ubisoft couldn’t trust me to make the few kilometers by boat over to that new spot. I’m not the most hardcore gamer, but I know how to follow a waypoint, is all I’m saying. They do it a few times and it’s needlessly disorienting. The fighting is sometimes bad up close. Nowhere does this become more obvious then when you’re simply trying to bash open some crates for loot. Especially when you’re indoors, it can become impossible just to bash a box or clay pot, with Eivor swinging for the fences but batting .500, maybe. Or that time I was fighting a zealot, took a spear through the chest, was teleported 100 feet away and 100 feet in the air, then summarily dropped to my death. Or all the times Senu, my raven, my eyes in the sky, would target lock something on the map, only to have that locked target disappear. Or the time I had to replay a mission involving a nudist sect because the mission objective wouldn’t trigger properly upon completion. I swear, that’s the only reason I played the nudist mission three times. Honest.I could go on about those errors, but none of them were gamebreakers. Technically the nudist mission was, yeah. But the rest of Valhalla plays out so wonderfully, and takes so many world-building cues from The Witcher 3 and Red Dead Redemption 2, that that stuff is forgivable in the grand scheme of things. Valhalla is all about family ties, brotherly love, and sibling rivalry. It doesn’t touch the level of drama introduced in, say, God of War’s father-son struggles. But Valhalla’s first major side quest was a full-on investigation of treachery within a Danish ally’s inner circle. That mission went from a retaken settlement, to a fog-laden swamp, to a secret underground tunnel, to interrogating folks around the shire about what they'd seen or hadn't seen the night of a devastating internal attack. And I’ll tell you what: by the time I had to settle the investigation and point my finger at a culprit and say, “That’s your bad guy,” it wasn’t a gimme. It wasn’t a no-brainer. I had to put some thought into that case. And I was still nervous I might be pointing out the wrong person in the lineup. I didn't save scum that part. I may never know if the imposter is still among us.On a more micro scale, there are so many small details that I do still take for granted in an Assassin’s Creed. How your footfalls match the angle of ground you’re standing on. Frosty breath in the cold. Dripping wet and shivering when you climb out of glacial waters. The trenches you leave when walking through deep snow. The snow caked onto your boots when you reach the muddy road. The mud that washes off your boots in the rain. All of these things add up to a world worth hundreds of hours to explore, even if none of it takes center stage.You can milk the narrative, speaking to every single person in the jarl’s longhouse like you’re checking off a side quest. Or you can get through the talky bits, guns blazing, as it were, skipping over that pesky narrative arc and troublesome character building. Me? I’m in the milk-it-for-all-it’s-worth camp. But you can sail right on past all of that if you want, easy peasy.The modern day parts of Assassin’s Creed are as inevitable as they are inescapable. Sometimes it feels bogged down. Especially when you’re digging through dozens of desktop files on a laptop, reading through weirdly dry expositions about “what is reality?” and so much talk of “the simulation within the simulation.” It can come off like an unwelcome conversation with Elon Musk who’s about two hits away from telling you how The Matrix is real.The main story is the overarching epic of the Raven Clan. That’s you. Those are your people. It hits the bullet points in the history books. But the small, succinct, optional side quests are where the fun storytelling happens. These are very human moments—and often very funny ones—doing the show-don’t-tell part of the narrative very well, portraying people’s thoughts and feelings on stuff that would otherwise be relegated to a codex entry.I have to pay Valhalla the highest compliment a reviewer can pay it: I don't want to write about it, I just want to play it. This series has its sweet spots dialed in. It really comes down to whether or not you love the time period and the set dressing. I love this time period. I love this set dressing. And Ubisoft more or less just follows its own recipe here. I'll be dipping my horn into this barrel of mead all winter.* The product in this article was sent to us by the developer/company.Randy gravitates toward anything open world, open ended, and open to interpretation.

When Assassin’s Creed moved away from its legacy open-world systems and adopted more RPG elements in 2017’s Origins, it felt like the start of something special, but only a half-step in its intended direction. 2018’s Odyssey moved much closer to that vision with many more successes than failures. Now, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla puts it all together and delivers the best RPG experience the Ubisoft series has seen yet, while telling a story that feels more freeform and full of life than all that came before it.In 9th century Norway, the Raven Clan departs from home and arrives in England and quickly overtakes a village by force, as Vikings do. This new settlement, deemed Ravensthorpe, becomes your hub of all life in the new country. Building it up one building at a time gives you direct control in how you approach Valhalla, and you can largely construct them in any order you’d like.There are over a dozen different ally tents, shops, and other areas to construct, and each one opens up new questlines and gameplay elements such as fishing, hunting early Templars (Order of the Ancients), or even holding feasts for your entire clan that will leave protagonist Eivor’s skills buffed for the toughest foes.With the ally map, Eivor and another of her clan’s leaders can commit to forming new bonds across the land. You’re fish out of water in England, so to survive, you’ll need new allies, and each new region you find yourself in introduces new arcs that play out like seasons of a years-long TV series. You can choose your own direction here too for a good while, provided you adhere to some suggested level thresholds. Valhalla connects the disparate pieces much better than even Odyssey, which I’d felt is the best game in the series. Now, it’s hard to say.There’s something to be said about the sheer size of Assassin’s Creed Valhalla. While the map of England appears substantially smaller than that of Greece or Egypt, it’s much fuller. New “World Event” side quests play out like Stranger missions in Red Dead Redemption 2, where you’ll routinely happen upon interesting new faces, sometimes several times over across their own mini-sagas, in stories that enrich the world around you and often tie directly into other activities you’ll want to do anyway.In my travels, I fought alongside a band of nuns armed only with their fists and the will of their God, played make-believe with a group of kids only to discover they were imagining a world where my clan is brutalized, and stole a crate of clothes on standby from a nudist colony. These and other stories don’t play into the main quests, but they color the world and make it hard to leave a region without substantially clearing the map.Assassin’s Creed Valhalla offers better RPG development mechanics than ever. A web-like skill tree allows players to incrementally improve Eivor’s power level into the 300+ marker. There are three basic trees, and the skills reveal themselves gradually as you progress down them. You’ll always have a few skills within reach, and along the way you’ll make Eivor stronger, faster, or sturdier across disciplines of ranged, melee, and stealth combat. Leveling up occurs often and doles out a pair of skill points each time, allowing players to chart their own paths.There are fewer adrenaline-draining abilities in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla than in Odyssey, which is for the best. Another change for the better is that you don’t unlock ability points; you find the abilities in the world by reading Books of Knowledge often tucked away in crypts and other environmental puzzles.Each ability can be found in two places, so when you find it again, you upgrade that ability. There are still plenty to choose from, but I love this approach because it doesn’t feel like you’re leaving so much behind. Builds can be customized down to the minutia without the game feeling like it’s thrown more at you than you could ever utilize.These abilities are a part of an improved combat system that doesn’t rewrite everything from the last few games, but instead adds satisfying wrinkles. Best of all is a new way to use ranged combat where enemy weak points are highlighted, and hitting them can cripple opponents and leave them vulnerable to devastating finishing blows. Gone are the spears, swords, and tridents, and in their place come axes, hammers, and, my favorite, flails. Each brings its own custom finisher that reminds you that Eivor, while malleable during various story beats, is unwaveringly fierce.Overall, the combat feels grittier than before, and it matches the world’s overcast skies and sometimes driving rain. When the sun peeks through, England has some beautiful sights to behold, but the people inhabiting it are often brutish and unforgiving. It’s an interesting backdrop in which to insert players and allow them to rise above these base instincts — or, just as validly, not.Despite all this player agency, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla will still bottleneck you when it wants to. There is an extended arc that feels out of place and dragged out, and it soured a lot of my early experience. It rips Eivor away from her clan, away from the story that was, until then, moving along so impressively, in favor of something that feels secondary to what really matters.On the other hand, the modern-day sections, which have largely felt stuck in place for the last several games, feel more important in Valhalla than in recent entries. It’s always a bit jarring to exit the Animus and play again as Layla, but I didn’t dread it this time because the story finally finds its rudder again.Regardless, if an 80+-hour game releases as polished, exciting, and engrossing as Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, a few pacing problems are acceptable. A lot of Eivor’s life feels new to the series too, making this game one of the easiest recommendations of the year. Viking Raids are fun new combat missions that reward you with major rewards that directly affect your settlement and reveal new activities.Eivor’s story is both personal and pivotal to the modern-day saga, giving way to yet another standout hero for the series to celebrate. It’s a game of many hits and very few misses, a body of work that exemplifies the series’s evolution.Since nearly all the various trinkets and relics and map markers have meaningful purpose, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is a rare open-world game where virtually every activity feels worth doing. Like Eivor scaling the snow-covered mountains of Norway, Valhalla achieves new heights for the RPG era of Assassin’s Creed, and I’ve never been more excited to see where the series goes next."
Assassin's Creed Valhalla,Jason Rodriguez,PC Invasion,https://www.pcinvasion.com/assassins-creed-valhalla-review-pc/,"Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is the twelfth major installment in Ubisoft’s flagship open-world, action-adventure series. Indeed, after reviewing Assassin’s Creed Odyssey back in 2018, I have been eagerly looking forward to what this latest offering in the franchise has in store. After all, how often do you get to play as a viking, right?In many ways, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla succeeds in delivering an amazing experience, and it’s one that should satisfy long-time fans and newcomers. However, there are a few issues that might become problematic during your playthrough. Assassin’s Creed Valhalla follows the story of Eivor the Wolf-Kissed, a Viking warrior from Norway. While I chose the female Eivor, you can freely switch between the male or female versions when you please.During the prologue and first act, Eivor seeks revenge on the leader of a rival clan. Eventually, she and her sworn brother Sigurd have to leave their home and set sail for England. The merry band even includes Basim and Hytham, two members of the Hidden Ones/Assassins Order, allowing Eivor to learn their tricks of the trade.Aiming to gain a foothold in Anglo-Saxon territory, Eivor is tasked with building and growing a settlement. You’re presented with several options that can be constructed such as an item shop, blacksmith, stables, shipyard, barracks, and more. The facilities you complete unlock additional quests to help you learn about your settlement’s inhabitants.Likewise, you’ll gain additional mechanics and features. For instance, the barracks lets you create your personal Jomsviking. This avatar can equip the same gear you own, and they can be recruited by other players. Should they become a part of another player’s raiding crew, they’ll return to you with some bonus silver.To continue growing your settlement, you’ll have to raid the English countryside. Indeed, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla lets you prey on hapless foes by burning villages, sacking monasteries, and capturing plunder. Just watch out, because you’re not allowed to kill a lot of civilians. That’s probably the antithesis of being a Viking.Then again, we have to consider that the game is set in 873 A.D., many years after the sons of Ragnar Lothbrok — the leaders of the Great Heathen Army — laid waste to the forces of Northumbria, Mercia, and East Anglia. As such, it may be a time period when the Norsemen and Anglo-Saxons were locked in a struggle, but many had also grown used to trading. In a few cases during the story, a semblance of friendship or respect exists between different cultures, tribes, and peoples.Speaking of the antithesis to being a Viking, it’s a reach to call this an Assassin’s Creed game — emphasis on the “assassin” part. Given that Vikings would announce their arrival by blowing a horn, we know that they weren’t prone to sneaking around. There are even missions when characters complain about hiding in the bushes instead of carving a path of bloody carnage.Still, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla manages to blend this concept well enough with the usual Hidden Blade/assassination gameplay we’ve come to know. My only gripe here is that civilians don’t really do much. Sure, they scream and yell when you murder someone in the streets. But guards that are further away won’t bother you.If you don’t like the silent but deadly approach, you can always head into the thick of the fighting. Assassin’s Creed Valhalla‘s combat truly shines here, because attacks and animations are fast-paced and fluid. You can quickly parry or dodge a strike, stagger a foe, and then launch a vicious combo.If an opponent’s defense breaks, you open them up for a finishing move. The animations themselves are different depending on the soldier’s archetype. For example, a spear-wielding warrior might find that polearm lodged in their belly. Meanwhile, a Goliath (who loves throwing you around) would get choked until they collapsed. Make no mistake, if Origins and Odyssey focused heavily on the action, then Valhalla takes it up a notch due to its multiple engagements and battles. There are even sieges in the game.Combat is complemented by two factors. The first is that every weapon type has its own attack pattern and combo, so using a flail would be vastly different from swinging a claymore or ax. Your playstyle would vary if you’ve got a two-handed weapon, a one-hander and shield setup, or when you’re dual-wielding.  You can even dual-wield two heavy weapons (or two shields).The second is that the skill tree has numerous nodes that give stat boosts, passive perks, and active skills. My favorites tend to be the “Stomp” and “Battleground Bolt” skills. The former is self-explanatory — you stomp on a downed opponent to deal tremendous damage. The latter, meanwhile, lets you throw a dropped weapon like a Hollywood action hero. Oh, and these skills are also separate from the abilities you obtain by finding tomes. Thanks to the aforementioned weapon types, combos, counters/finishers, abilities, and calling on your raiding party, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla‘s combat is extremely flashy, unbelievably satisfying, and ridiculously fun.If there’s one glaring flaw that the Assassin’s Creed franchise is known for, it’s that it has become too formulaic and repetitive. Make no mistake: if Assassin’s Creed Valhalla‘s combat and assassinations excite you, then the game’s mission progression system will become extremely tedious.When starting the arc or “saga” in a new region, Eivor’s first quest usually involves meeting an NPC. Then, you walk or ride with that character as they give you extra details. Next, there’s a quick skirmish (maybe against a dozen opponents or some wild animals). That’s followed by more exposition and several short quests. In some cases, there might even be a crime scene recreation, as if you were watching CSI: Jorvik. All of your efforts culminate in major siege battles, and these too follow a typical pattern. When this is completed, you pick another region.There were a few minor issues, too, such as some slowdown when swapping between a gamepad and a mouse and keyboard setup during regular gameplay. Additionally, a few quests were bugged, though they could be fixed by reloading an autosave. Moreover, mounts could sometimes get stuck and be unable to jump down off a ledge (you need to gain momentum and have them galloping at full throttle first). Perhaps the most glaring bug I encountered was related to the Thousand Eyes Shop (akin to Odyssey‘s Oikos of the Olympians). Although I was able to interact with the vendor early in my playthrough, I eventually realized that I could no longer talk to the NPC after some time had passed. This locked me out of purchasing items via the opal currency (this game’s version of orichalcum). I’ve even finished dozens of arcs and upgraded my settlement’s level to no avail.If you don’t want a tedious and tiresome campaign — one that can take roughly 40 hours for the main narrative alone — then you might want to mix things up with the distractions that Assassin’s Creed Valhalla offers. Norway and England both have huge maps for you to explore (and there are other areas which I won’t spoil here). These regions have collectibles that the series is known for. You could find new equipment, settlement supplies, upgrade materials, extra skill points, sidequests, and more.There are also standing stone puzzles to complete, deadly beasts to hunt, infamous bosses to take down, and many other side activities. Oh, and let’s not forget your assassination targets, the members of the Order of the Ancients, and zealot followers. Some of them are encountered during storyline arcs while others are found as you’re freely roaming the land.Likewise, there are minigames for you to try out. You could bet on the drinking minigame or engage in “flyting,” a Medieval rap battle of sorts. The latter even increases your charisma which opens up new dialogue options.There’s also Orlog, a game of dice, with some magic thrown in the mix. I must say that I loved playing this and collecting the various God Favors from defeated opponents. Think of this as something akin to The Witcher‘s Gwent or Final Fantasy VIII‘s Triple Triad.In the end, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla manages to surprise, owing to a new level of immersion. As you sail along pristine rivers and craggy shorelines, raiders boisterously share stories and tall tales. While completing quests, people compare and contrast their Norse pagan faith and Christianity. There are so many references to ancient rituals, cultural practices, and traditions that you’d feel that these characters and beliefs have come to life. In relation to that, legendary personages such as Alfred the Great, Harald Fairhair, and Ivar the Boneless get their time to shine.Furthermore, as mentioned in our technical review, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is visually stunning. Just be forewarned that it might be a little demanding as well. Using 4K resolution, my Nvidia GTX 1070 Ti GPU and Intel i7-7700K CPU could only manage 30 FPS with custom settings. Nevertheless, from the frozen fjords of Norway and the green pastures of England to other places you might visit, the sights and sounds are marvelous to behold. Everything seemed so picture-perfect that I often found myself in awe of my surroundings — I couldn’t stop using photo mode to capture moments. Once again, Ubisoft has crafted a truly captivating world. Plus, you can switch to “follow the road/river” and cinematic mode to sit back and relax.Although I did have a few qualms with how the missions/arcs were structured, towards the end, I felt that the entire journey in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla was remarkable. I won’t spoil how Eivor’s tale unfolds, but it truly is an epic Viking saga.Assassin's Creed Valhalla's mission structure can be a little tedious at times. However, it still manages to exhilarate and excite thanks to its wonderful visuals, vivid landscapes, side activities, and brilliant combat mechanics.About Us

Assassin's Creed Valhalla,James Paley,COGconnected,https://cogconnected.com/review/assassins-creed-valhalla-review/,"We want a lot out of our games these days. It’s not enough to just run around, stabbing people in the neck with a tiny wrist blade. Now we need base building, fishing minigames, rap battles, coastal raids, skill trees, and the ever-present crafting mechanics. I’m unclear if we asked for this or what, but Ubisoft has graciously provided this gameplay buffet all the same. This has become the new standard for Assassin’s Creed games. Let the player want for nothing. Yet, none of these endless systems feel properly explored on their own. Instead, we are left to fill up on tiny bites of a dozen different ideas. You can still make a meal out of that, however. Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, to extend the metaphor, makes for a sumptuous buffet.A most important disclaimer beforehand: I haven’t properly played an Assassin’s Creed game since the first one. This will be my second foray into the world of sneakin’ and stabbin’ since 2007. So a lot of the juicy historical context is absent from my experience. That said, the history of the series is baked into the bones of this beast. Every newly-introduced gameplay mechanic is layered atop the others, so that your core loop is festooned with systems. You can assassinate foes, go on raids, go fishing, build your village, engage in flyting/rap battles, fill out a massive skill tree, slowly uncover a vast conspiracy, complete random side missions, do some fight clubbing, hunt for treasure, or complete the main narrative. This isn’t an exhaustive list, either. This is just what I could remember off the top of my head. And that’s kind of a problem.This has been, as I understand it, the new burden of the AC series. Fans were looking for something new, so Ubisoft started adding features. Every successive release scoops up and retains more of these features, leading to a map UI choking on clutter. None of it feels especially shallow, or flawed, but it does feel like a lot. On a mechanical level, these endless options are fine. They run well, they’re neatly implemented into the larger gameplay loop, and they’re terribly compelling. But there’s enough of them to be distracting, too. I had to make an executive decision early on, that I wouldn’t get sucked up in side dishes unless they were critical to my continued progression. And while they’re mechanically compelling, it feels antithetical to your immersion to have this fiery warrior take several hours to save up for a new fishing hut. If nothing else, Valhalla demonstrates how difficult it is to engage with all these activities without slamming the brakes on your forward progress.My Assassin’s Creed history lessons have taught me that these games never launch without a meaty fistful of bugs. This was no exception, though said bugs were pretty tame. Sure, some dialogue stuttered, a few textures fought to catch up, some frames were skipped, and a crash or two occurred, but it mostly ran just… fine? This is prior to a day one patch, by the way. You, the reader, might see none of what I’m describing here. We’ve come a long ways from the days of faces not showing up in cutscenes. The flaws are so minimal that I forgot about them until the game crashed. Even then, I was quickly lost in the rhythms of play once more. No, the bugs ain’t bad at all, this time around at least.Viking raids and stealth combat make for weird bedfellows. While Ubisoft is no stranger to grafting discordant ideas on one another, this particular combination feels especially uneven. Certain missions will let you choose between the two paths, and they’re not equally weighted. At least for me, blowing on the raider’s horn held infinitely more appeal than sneaking in the back door. Which is not to say that I never used stealth! It’s just a lot of fun calling all your viking buddies to come burn down buildings and split necks like birch trees. More than ever, the stealth mechanics feel stapled on. They’re still rock-solid from a technical perspective. It’s just that the old Norse setting and the plentiful RPG trappings make stealth activity feel extraneous. What good is the back door when you’re so good at breaking down the front one?As for that front-door approach, Valhalla excels at its execution. Your comrades are pretty self-reliant, content to charge up and start cracking skulls with next to no prompting on your part. You just tell them to raid and off they go! They’ll even set fire to the buildings and help you open enormous treasure chests. If you’re lost in the middle of an assault, you can follow one of the protagonists to the next objective. Only when you’re fighting bosses are you on your own. Beyond that, your squad is a reliable and useful tool during raids and big battles. You can also fiddle with the difficulty to an impressive degree. Fights, stealth, and exploration are all set to separate difficulty settings. For someone like myself, who often gets tripped up by stealth sections, this is a real boon. Apparently, you can even make high-level assassinations a sure thing, though I haven’t tested this for myself.The flexibility in difficulty extends to other areas, as well. The skill tree is big enough to be imposing, which could lead to some tough choices. Thankfully, you can reset your skill points at any time. Who wants to agonize over which branch to choose? Try them all, why don’t you? Maybe prioritize health over attack this time around, see where that leads you. It’s a valuable freedom, especially for a game of this size. You can even swap your character’s gender whenever you want, if the female or male version of the story is getting dull. It’s nice to know I can go from a burly assault type, to a still-pretty-burly stealth build, whenever I so desire.This same freedom of choice and flexibility is what ultimately pins Assassin’s Creed Valhalla to the wall. This is an experience composed of morsels, dozens of fun things pressed into one. The core gameplay loop is just a series of smaller loops, none of which really come out on top. Every element is pretty good, but not quite great, on its own. But those bits still add up to a lot of fun had over a lot of hours. Without the first-hand historical context provided by the bulk of the series, I can’t be certain about this game’s intended audience. Perhaps the fanbase wants exactly this kind of game. Perhaps Ubisoft has given hardcore fans the best entry in over a decade. All I know is that I had more fun than I was expecting, while still being cognizant of the game’s weird, cluttered assembly on full display. I’m padding through the dark, a tourist reading placards to seasoned scholars. In spite of this, I feel confident that fans and newcomers alike will have a pretty good time here.***A PS4 code was provided by Ubisoft***Developer: Ubisoft MontrealPublisher: Ubisoft"
