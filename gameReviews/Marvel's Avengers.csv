Marvel's Avengers,Vikki Blake,Eurogamer,https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-09-08-marvels-avengers-review-not-super-enough,"True believer?For every one thing to love about Marvel's Avengers, there's something to cancel it out, as though it's a shiny machine that's been meticulously crafted by clever people in white coats and clipboards to neutralise every last drop of enjoyment. It doesn't matter what great ingredients you feed into the mouth of the machine - a loveable lead, perhaps, or a stellar voice cast - because by the end of it, the device works to counter every one of those positives with something irritating or frustrating. The result is a curiously bland, neutral experience that's neither terrific nor terrible but masterfully straddles both in a way that's quite frankly astonishing.To make matters worse, there are many times - usually within the mostly satisfying single-player campaign - when Marvel's Avengers isn't bland at all. Kamala Khan - aka Ms Marvel - is adorable, and her story, if a little predictable, hits all the beats you'd expect from a tale set in such an iconic universe. The combat is fine, if unrefined. The visuals are fine, if unremarkable. The looting is fine, if a bit useless. The environments are fine, if a bit repetitive. The gentle loot puzzles are fine, if shockingly simple. But fine isn't going to keep you here, is it? Fine isn't enough to make more demands of your time and money. And that's the problem. The single-player campaign is easily the game's strongest draw, offering an enjoyable, if rote set of missions that follow Ms Marvel's transformation from nerdy fangirl to bonafide superhero as she works to unite the posse after they disband, having been unfairly blamed for a catastrophic event. She joins the fight to clear their name and rescue the unsuspecting Inhumans snatched from the city streets, working to take down the villainous AIM organisation and its hordes of murderous robots along the way.Mechanically and visually the adventure is perfunctory. It's a tad rough around the edges, as though a lack of time or money - maybe both - prevented that final glossy spit-shine of polish. That's not to say I didn't enjoy myself because I very much did at times, but the Marvel's Avengers machine is too bloody good at counteracting the good bits by serving up something that will annoy or frustrate, too.Take, for example, the mission ""Starktech Outfits"". You're rocketing towards the exhilarating climax of the single-player campaign. It's been tense and exciting, and while the places you visit typically vary in name only - the AIM architects seemingly hail from the IKEA school of identikit design - there's no denying that you're getting close to a final showdown with the Ultimate Super-Villain antagonist... and then you're thrown into a tedious resource-gathering mission. It's not even that you've had these missions before - you haven't. But it's now, when you're around 90 per cent done and itching to take on the big bad - this is when Marvel's Avengers throws in a fetch-quest to gather electronic components from robotic corpses. While the enemies concerned aren't hard to find or destroy, there's currently no way to replay story missions, either, so there's no way to revisit an area where you've encountered them previously. Instead, you have to hop onto the War Table, pick a stray side quest you've yet to complete, and hope you'll find them. All momentum is shattered, leaving you frustrated and uncertain on what the hell you're meant to do next.Worse still, it's about as stable as a one-legged stool. I've had times where the dialogue is wrong, overlapping, or not playing at all. I once played half a mission seeing only the outline of Black Widow's skull and the backs of her camo-cloaked eyes. I was forced to buy gear from a new vendor - using up all my resources in the process - only for the item to never make it to my inventory. I didn't notice much stuttering and slowdown at the beginning, but the further into the story you go - and the more enemies that swarm on-screen - the more problematic it becomes. I've also had two hard crashes that forced me to reboot my PS4 Pro, and several occasions where loading hung indefinitely - an issue made all the more unbearable given how long Marvel's Avengers loading screens are anyway. Once, my co-op partner was stuck in the loading screen's helicarrier for a protracted period, yet could hear Hulk grunt and stomp around if he hit ""X"". That said, when I do get the right dialogue in the right places, good grief, does the diamond-tier voice cast show. It can't have been easy for them to come into a franchise as well-known and beloved as Marvel's cinematic universe and perform as such established characters, but even with the cheesy script, the voice work is impeccable. Troy Baker's contemplative, softly-spoken Bruce Banner is a particularly memorable performance, and one that's possibly my favourite of his to date. But while the game quite rightly ensures you spend time with every hero on the roster - and successfully unifies a single control scheme for multiple characters, which can't be easy to pull off - I came to loathe missions that forced me to play as Iron Man or Thor. Aerial combat is clunky to the point of frustration, while vaulting and parrying, too, are a little hit and miss. Combat is melee-based with a handful of ranged and special skills thrown in, and it's okay - even enjoyable at times - but the extensive skill trees don't add as much to the mix as you might hope despite each hero's bespoke abilities.Levelling up gear is useless to the point of disbelief - there is so much of it, there's little point boosting the power of anything until well after you've completed the campaign. Unlike Destiny - from which Marvel's Avengers' seems to draw much of its looter-shooter inspirations - there's no cosmetic benefit, and barely a tactical advantage, either, which makes you wonder why there are vendors or factions in the first place. Mission objectives are recycled to the point of tedium, and while upping the difficulty boosts the challenge and rewards, this leaves some encounters feeling peculiarly imbalanced. My favourite moments have been with a co-op partner at my side, times when we've synchronised attacks to wail on the same bad guy simultaneously, but the game fights at every turn to prevent me from doing that, too. You'll need to get through a couple of hours of the solo campaign before you even open up the War Table mission-select screen, and despite the fact your single-player missions are often populated with AI companions, you can't replace one with a friend. It's such an antiquated approach, and an odd design choice for a game seemingly so well-suited for co-op.Similarly, I don't understand why you're forced into a simulated HARM combat tutorial when you start the multiplayer mode, Avengers' Initiative, given the game all but insists you complete the solo campaign first. Why would anyone need another basic combat tutorial after finishing the 12-ish hour single-player content? It doesn't make sense. As for the microtransactions? I know there's a disingenuous trend of publishers deactivating the most egregious offerings until several weeks post-launch when people like me have already scribbled up our thoughts, but right now the offerings on Marvel's Avengers' marketplace truly are ""just"" cosmetic, and... well, dull, quite frankly. I don't particularly like the Hero Pass system - the individual battle passes locked to each hero - and like many of the game's live-service aspects, they feel inelegant and obtrusive, stapled onto a frame that didn't need it and can't properly support it. But the passes do offer some additional hero-specific missions, which are pretty enjoyable, so... I don't know. They're inoffensive right now - all six starting heroes boast ""free"" hero passes - but it'll be much harder to recommend future ones that want your real-life money (I know that completing a pass essentially ""refunds"" you the cost of it, but I'm not sure how feasible that is for most. We'll see, I guess.) As a live-service game, you can expect lots of tweaks and changes as the weeks morph into months, but having magpied so much from those kinds of games it's left with little identity of its own. Despite the promise of its campaign, its endearing cast and impressive voice work, Marvel's Avengers is an unoriginal and uninspired affair that falls sadly short of what it could have been - what it should have been.

Here’s how it works.A well-told campaign and story do their best to mask a rather scrawny service game beneath.PC Gamer's got your back 


Our experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you. Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware.As the Marvel’s Avengers campaign ends, to be replaced by samey missions, it reminds me of the dual identity of so many superheroes. Avengers straps on its tightest, glossiest spandex for the campaign and dazzles with its moves, but once that adventure ends and it returns to the daily grind of a multiplayer-oriented endgame, it blurs into the crowd. Inoffensive, yet indistinguishable but for its famous superhero superstars.The frustrating thing about Marvel’s Avengers is that for the first few hours, you see hints of what it could have been—a visually spectacular and satisfying adventure—but then a functional, unoriginal loop of missions takes over, and you realise that that’s the actual game you’ll be spending most of your time with.The campaign offers a simple story, following future Ms. Marvel Kamala Khan as she seeks to reassemble the Avengers following a disaster that creates a wave of new superheroes labelled as ‘Inhumans’. You’re pitted against floating-head-with-tiny-limbs, MODOK, who’s intent on wiping out all Inhumans with the help of AIM’s Scientist Supreme Monica Rappaccini and her army of robots.A pretty regular Marvel setup then, and beautifully written, animated, and voice-acted throughout. I found myself actively looking forward to the cutscenes and snippets of in-game banter.The relationship between Bruce Banner and Kamala Khan unfolds beautifully. Banner’s unsure body language and mix of irritation and avuncular care he shows towards Khan—whose chirpy teenage optimism is just what 2020 needs—is a masterclass of voicework and mocap. It also elegantly addresses the fact that, to a 30-plus curmudgeon like me, the fresh-faced Khan can be kind of annoying, but her convincing character arc soon gets me completely onboard.Given the amount of big names the campaign has to introduce, it’s understandable that not all the relationships get the same level of attention, but each character still entertains as you bring the Avengers’ floating command centre back to life. The villain MODOK, with his pustulent, hypertrophic head that seems to swell up with every scene, is brilliantly brought to life. The performance turns one of Marvel’s goofiest-looking heroes into a memorable, eerily soft-spoken villain.However, once you’re aboard the Avengers’ Chimera ship, it becomes a little too obvious that you’re being roped into the publisher’s long game. You walk around on deck as your Avenger of choice, picking up time-limited challenges from vendors, buying gear using real or in-game currency, and using a map to freely drop into missions set across several biomes around the world. Some you do solo, others you do alongside up to three other Avengers, who can be controlled by AI or online players. I’d play with others where possible, and it speaks to the simplicity of the missions and combat that there’s not too much need for communication or a balanced squad.I did get to play online alongside Hulk wearing a Hawaiian shirt and fedora though.I’ve been reading a a little bit about performance problems on PC, but can say that my experience has been mostly stable. There were a couple of odd bugs during the campaign that forced me to restart the game, and multiplayer matchmaking has been very slow from my experience, forcing me to give up after minutes of waiting multiple times.The combat is a curious mix of classic brawler moves like juggling, suspended aerial attacks and light-heavy combos with the counter-and-dodge-based style of the Arkham games (there’s even a move where you jump over a shielded enemy’s head to break their shield). Little icons on the edges of the screen tell you how close a missile or laser is to blasting you away, while enemy melee attacks are telegraphed by coloured circles, which let you know whether to dodge or parry them. Get enough attacks together, and your rage meter fills, letting you unlock spectacular special moves like Iron Man summoning his Hulkbuster mech, or Ms. Marvel turning into a long-limbed giantess resembling a wacky waving inflatable tube girl.The icons give you a lot to think about while filling your screen with a confetti of mechanised enemies and special moves executed by your fellow Avengers, and it doesn’t always feel like you—or even the game itself—can keep up. A couple of dozen hours in, I’ll still often dodge instead of parrying when the enemy attack circle is white (dodge for red, dammit!), and that all-important telegraphing of enemy moves isn’t entirely consistent, and the camera’s a little too close for comfort - great for ogling Hulk’s slabs of back muscle, not so great for managing space in a scuffle.Playing as the speedsters of the group, Ms. Marvel and Black Widow, feels much better than Hulk, whose lumbering style doesn’t sync well with the already slowish animations and floaty jumping physics. High-flyers Iron Man and Thor, meanwhile, definitely offer a buzz as you can freely swoop into battle from way overhead of your buddies. Unfortunately finer aerial maneuvering and attacks are fiddly and much weaker than melee. It may be fun to fly, but the action’s really on the ground.But in a game so much about fan service, there’s something to be said for making each superhero feel unique, even if that is at the expense of balance. The characters move and attack just like you remember from the movies or imagine from the comics, right down to the disinterested way Hulk toe-pokes chests open. During these little moments, and amidst the on-screen muddle when you string together a bunch of counters and executions before letting rip with a hero’s special move, the superhero fantasy successfully shines.The bigger problems come later. Missions may be set all over the world, but levels themselves are sparse expanses of snow/forests/city where you hunt for crates hidden in metal bunkers guarded by faceless robots, before proceeding to complete a main objective—destroying a few structures, or holding onto some control points, Battlefield-style. The game tries to spruce things up with awkward platforming segments and hunts for SHIELD stashes (essentially a slightly better stash among endless stashes), but they’re visually ugly and unvaried, in stark contrast to the elegantly animated and designed superheroes that run around them.Also, for some reason the ‘Power’ level required for various missions is all over the place, greatly restricting the amount of missions you can tackle. I was quite up for a boss-fight mission that SHIELD offered for their daily challenge (which improves your faction rank with SHIELD, which lets you buy locked-off gear yada-yada), only to find that I was dozens of levels below being able to do it. These are the kinds of things that can be smoothed out over the coming months, but as things stand a good chunk of the endgame remains level-gated.Back aboard the Chimera, the metagame of daily challenges, endless gear upgrades (with daily ‘specialty’ items) and missions becomes particularly noticeable post-campaign. Without the more bespoke campaign-specific missions and story to break them up, the monotony begins to set in, and while there is an obsessive feedback loop to repeating missions, upgrading your gear, and improving your character in perpetuity, you don’t even get to see these gear upgrades. The only aesthetic changes are different costumes, which are a hard to find, and otherwise locked behind higher levels and real-world currency.There’s nothing too egregious about the microtransactions, which are purely cosmetic and also include emotes, nameplates and execution animations, but there’s nothing particularly satisfying to work towards in the endgame either.Perhaps a fleshed-out single-player campaign will never be enough to satisfy Avenger's marketing aims. The story is worthy of Marvel’s movie canon, but it’s too short and ends up being a shiny wrapper for what’s currently a rudimentary game-as-service.  This comes with the caveat that it’s just getting started, and there have been plenty of online-oriented games that started slowly. There’s enough button-mashy mileage in the combat system, especially as new heroes get introduced as DLC, but it’s the mission design and loot loop that let it down. It's just not strong or varied enough to justify the long-term investment the game wants from you.Not that justification beyond a 14-hour campaign and 'it’s your favourite superheroes and they look amazing' is needed for a day one purchase, based on the game’s early sales. But if Marvel’s Avengers wants to keep loyalists sweet and expand its player-base, it needs a lot more flesh on its vibranium skeletal armature. If only the game could carry some of its narrative prowess from the campaign over into the endgame.A well-told campaign and story do their best to mask a rather scrawny service game beneath.Robert is a freelance writer and chronic game tinkerer who spends many hours modding games then not playing them, and hiding behind doors with a shotgun in Hunt: Showdown.

Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy.The Marvel's Avengers marketing campaign and its multi-weekend beta buried the lede, guys. At the core of this loot-based, cosmetic-heavy, live-service game is a fantastic, roughly 12-hour campaign full of pathos, personality, and yes, a lot of punching. If you're surprised by that, you're not alone - I was shocked to complete the now all-too-familiar opening scene and dive into a captivating campaign centered around the perfect protagonist. So shocked, I didn't want it to end.If Marvel's Avengers is an Iron Man suit, Kamala Khan is its arc reactor, propelling the story forward and providing necessary emotional torque. She should have been featured in the marketing materials far more than she was, because she really is *the* Avenger in this game. Her story and the simultaneous story of the Avengers we know and love overcoming failure and crippling self-doubt in order to reassemble is a rock-solid one (and I dare say better than one or two of the Avengers films). Check out our review video below:But it's what comes after the campaign that causes Marvel's Avengers to stretch at the seams until it bursts. There’s simply just too much - too much insignificant gear and confusing numbers, too many rinse-and-repeat multiplayer missions that are full of too much punching and kicking enveloped in too many pulsing, over-saturated colors. Each side mission is like a souped-up Honda street racer that went overboard with extras - neon lights, glowing gauges, explosions, reflective metal, and pithy catchphrases slapping against your ears like a surplus of bumper stickers on a rear window. With Marvel's Avengers, there's a tight, emotionally resonant campaign… and then there's everything else. Like Kamala Khan struggling with her new Inhuman identity after exposure to Terrigen mist, this game can't figure out what the hell it is.In Kamala Khan, Marvel's Avengers gives us a beloved character not yet seen outside of the comics - that she's a Pakistani-American teenage girl dealing with social ostracization because of her Inhuman status only makes her story more relevant and poignant. Using her as the hub from which the plot spokes extend works well.Kamala opens the game at an Avengers event, where she takes a stand against some gatekeeping assholes, meets a few Avengers In the flesh, and shows off her pure and plucky nature. It's immediately after this warm, tingly opening that you're thrust into the A-Day tragedy - the same part from the beta. Once the ""Test Drive the Avengers"" portion is over, you're back in Kamala's world - let it wrap around you like a warm blanket that will be abruptly ripped off of you in your sleep. It's a shame that this isn't a standalone Kamala Khan game with fun (playable) cameos from other Avengers. While the rest of the team is played to uncanny valley perfection by a veritable who's-who of iconic VO actors, it's their interactions with Kamala that humanize them and make them unique characters outside of - but still tangential to - the MCU. Bruce Banner (Troy Baker) sees Kamala (Sandra Saad) as a problem to offload on someone else before seeing her as a peer with more courage than him. Tony (Nolan North) relishes her willingness to laugh at his one-liners, and gives her an early superhero costume pep talk that involves a promise to jazz up her burkini. Natasha (Laura Bailey) openly hates kids, but ends up giving Kamala her own version of a stunted, broken approval speech. And Thor (Travis Willingham), well, he remembers her from A-Day, which is honestly quite touching. Each one of these heroes has a moment where they need reassurance and validation, and Kamala rises to the occasion, reassembling the Avengers both physically and emotionally in a surprisingly good campaign - surprising not only because it's great, but because no one really knew it existed in the first place.Once you wrap up the core campaign, Marvel's Avengers' cracks begin to show - and those cracks become chasms faster than you can say ""assemble"". As someone who doesn't play live-service loot games or min-max until I’m blue in the face, I chose to focus on the initial story first before returning to the myriad side missions, HARM room training options, and the daunting task of navigating menus with bad UI. This proved to be an issue, as my endgame was a confusing one.Marvel's Avengers' post-game content is convoluted, to say the least. After completing the story, I couldn’t figure out how to get back to the Avengers’ ship because of the confusing UI and was stuck at the War Table until I reset the game. But upon getting back to the War Table, I'm greeted with (brace yourself) a few locations from which to choose, within which several mission options pop up for various types of missions for me to select (including faction quests, Drop Zones, Iconic Missions, Villain Sectors, and more). Then I'm thrust into a pre-match menu with various heroes and their various gear to pick from, upon which I'm dropped into a mission and immediately told that I have unequipped higher-level gear available. Are you exhausted? I am. And while Marvel's Avengers was certainly marketed as comic book Destiny, it wrongfully assumes half of its player base understands the myriad numbers thrust at them, or cares to pick through the heaps of gear trash they discover during the samey post-game missions. There's no justifiable reason for making an Avengers game centered around gear, except that the live-service, battle-pass friendly game with legs beyond its launch date is trendy right now. Which Avengers other than Iron Man and Black Widow are known for being sluts for gadgets? The fact that you craft in order to level up Hulk's muscle fibers to make an insignificant upgrade to his power level (which, BTW, is different from his hero level) means nothing to me, and I'm sure it means nothing to his angry green ass. Even when I tried to get on the loot treadmill and tediously break down my lower-level gear to make one of nine different crafting currencies that would enhance my higher-level gear, there was no discernible difference between the old gear I broke down and the gear I had just tinkered with. There's not even any aesthetic change (that's saved for cosmetics only), so you're just squinting at slightly different Black Widow belt buckles that each have convoluted cards touting their abilities. These are then presumably equipped under her existing uniform. What is the point?But what is it actually like to step into the Lycra of your favorite superheroes? Marvel's Avengers' button-mashing combat can feel fun and sometimes it can even feel like you can master that button-mashing to make certain heroes OP - with other heroes, however, it's an unenjoyable beat-em-up. Black Widow and Iron Man are two standouts, with extensive skill trees that let you stack cool new moves as you progress. Iron Man's flight feels just as good - if not better than - the Javelins in Anthem, and as I levelled him further I was able to add some seriously sick moves to his arsenal, including one where holding triangle while flying sends him shooting forward, criss-crossing lasers out of his hands. Black Widow is especially fun and fast and her skill tree evolves to a point that you feel like you're playing her in an MCU scene: Widow dashes forward and drop-kicks a mech, quickly gets to her feet and fires a grappling hook at a hovering droid that sends her careening towards it, whereupon she lands a front flip kick on the droid, drops to the ground, and fires a pistol at a mounted turret. Sick.Both Widow and Iron Man's ranged abilities make the endless mounted turrets that Crystal Dynamics jams into every mission a bit less irritating - if you're playing Hulk during a turret section, you'll be forced to rip up concrete from the ground and huck it at them individually, which gets old when there are six or so mounted to a damn building. Speaking of Hulk - his lumbering gameplay style doesn't jive well with the game's combat speed or its noticeably floaty physics. He feels nailed to the ground in almost every mission, and is largely unfun. Thor has a similar problem for me, in which his weightiness doesn't feel properly ironed out, while Kamala Khan is light and fun to play as, even though her moves do get stale. With the promise of DLC heroes down the pipe, it's easy to imagine how characters like Spider-Man and Kate Bishop will keep the combat feeling somewhat fresh - even if the post-campaign missions are staler than day-old shawarma pita. Does the promise of new heroes on the horizon mean this game has long-term legs? Unless there are some serious changes made to jazz up the post-game missions, it's hard to imagine anyone except for the gear-obsessed playing this in six months. There are also quite a few bugs skittering about Marvel's Avengers that Crystal Dynamics can and should address in future updates. Hulk seems perpetually buggy whenever he's an AI teammate - he froze while hanging from a wall in the HARM room twice, and there were several times when he flat-out refused to be revived no matter how long I stood in the little ring around him. I encountered several audio bugs, including one that had Kamala loudly shouting ""WOO"" in perpetuum until I triggered a cutscene, and one in which the Gear menu remained glued to my screen during a SHIELD faction mission. Sometimes it feels like the game is struggling to keep up with itself, like a Terrigen reactor on the brink of exploding.Marvel's Avengers has a glittery and joyous core campaign that manages to stack up to modern-day Avengers stories. Its gameplay is varied enough between heroes that there are shining stand-outs and ones that belong in the bin. But its chintzy game-as-service portion takes up too much time and bandwidth, ultimately crippling its chances of being a great game.Reviewed on PS4, code provided by the publisher. Alyssa Mercante is an editor and features writer at GamesRadar based out of Brooklyn, NY.

Marvel's Avengers,Andrew Reiner,Game Informer,https://www.gameinformer.com/review/marvels-avengers/marvels-avengers-review-a-powerful-superhero-experience,"Like the rampaging Hulk and his transformation into the brainy Bruce Banner, Marvel’s Avengers is a game of shifting personas and experiences. Developer Crystal Dynamics delivers a powerful superhero showcase that taps into each Avenger’s unique abilities to light up the battlefield in thrilling ways, but when the dust settles, it slows down to show a softer, human side that is every bit as engaging, placing a character you wouldn’t expect in the central role.Crystal Dynamics makes a huge gamble right out of the gate, delivering the message that even though the name Avengers is on the box, this is actually a story about a young girl named Kamala Khan – a huge fan of the super team.The opening moments show Kamala at an Avengers convention, geeking out when she meets the likes of Captain America and Black Widow. Kamala’s viewpoint as a little kid is a refreshing change of pace, and her excitement is likely in line with the player’s, showing an appreciation for these awesome heroes. It’s a fun way to kick off this story, but I was shocked by just how little screen time the Avengers get in early parts of the campaign. They are hardly featured within the first three to four hours of play, but it oddly works.The focus this time is instead on Kamala’s origin story and her growing into the role of Ms. Marvel. This coming-of-age tale is beautifully penned with some legitimately touching moments along the way. Even as she is learning about her powers, Kamala shows us she’s no slouch in combat, using a wild set of fun shapeshifting moves to pummel foes. While combat is the central hook, a good portion of Kamala’s gameplay is distinct and consists of frantic platforming.Ms. Marvel grabs onto ledges, tumbles when platforms crumble under her feet, and barely survives every big leap – all elements that recall Crystal Dynamics’ previous work on the Tomb Raider series. Kamala is even pushed to use stealth in a few sequences to sneak past AIM robots that serve MODOK, another character that is realized in awesome ways and is developed thoroughly from start to finish.The platforming action is differentiated by a superhuman element, allowing players to use Ms. Marvel’s stretching abilities to propel her great distances and feel like a hero. These sequences, while impressing with the level destruction often on display, are repetitive in their steps, and fail to deliver a true sense of danger. They do, however, aid the narrative and help Kamala further develop into the game’s most dynamic character. It’ a game about the Avengers, yet the true star isn’t part of their ranks. I love that the story takes chances to keep you off-kilter, all with a satisfying amount of narrative pay-off.When Ms. Marvel meets the Hulk in her attempt to reunite the team, the entire game structure transforms. It moves from linear, story-driven sequences to a hub format filled with deep RPG systems and a world map with a dizzying array of single-player and cooperative missions. I didn’t like hoofing it in the hub world to talk to various vendors, but the map is nicely designed and gives you all of the info you need before jumping into new critical-path missions or side activities.At this point in the game, Kamala Khan’s story remains strong, and is joined by mini-arcs for each of the Avengers. Crystal Dynamics did a nice job creating scenarios tailored to these heroes’ unique abilities.The Hulk is the unstoppable monstrosity you’d hope, smashing enemies and environments to bits. Thor’s Mjölnir absolutely wallops enemies, and each swing feels like it is delivered by a god. I also enjoyed the shield antics of Captain America (who doesn’t get much screen time for good narrative reasons), and the acrobatics of Black Widow. All of these heroes have great cinematic moments backed by huge gameplay setpieces. I don’t want to spoil any of them, but one cool sequence has you frantically running as the environment rotates around you. Crystal Dynamics also keeps you on your toes by challenging the norm for many of the heroes, putting them in situations where they may not have their gear or are wounded.Iron Man is the only character that I didn’t find enthralling. His gameplay isn’t bad, but it’s tedious; his ranged attacks aren’t much fun, and his close-quarters melee isn’t as impressive as the other heroes’. Nolan North’s performance as Tony Stark is good – his voice and delivery work – but the jokes are overdone, sounding like a one-liner machine on the fritz.All of the characters share similarities in button mapping, but feel distinct when it comes to combat and moves. Light and heavy combos abound for each hero, and are a blast to use. Each character also has a nice solution for ranged or airborne targets. The dodge, block, and parry systems are put to good use against almost every AIM enemy type, though your foes don’t have much variety.Every encounter and success feeds into an experience point system that allows you to level up and earn new abilities. Avengers offers a surprising amount of depth in this field. You can’t really spec out a hero differently than their base potential, but you can add extra moves to combos, speed up cooldowns on ranged attacks, and make each character more lethal in certain ways. There are over 100 abilities for each character. It’s a rewarding system that will keep you playing for a long time.Most of the critical-path missions are nicely designed and offer up plenty of rewards, but the same cannot be said of some of the side activities. For example, some assignments consist of destroying a just few things, so the mission is over almost as quickly as it began; I think I spent more time in the pre-match lobby (which can take time to load and find other players) than actually playing. You also get some odd control-point missions, which push you to stand on a spot to claim it, almost like Crystal Dynamics was thinking about competitive multiplayer ideas and just decided to use them here instead. The control missions are easy with other players at your side, but can be maddening with A.I., which rarely try to claim spaces.The heroes are better when they are united on the battlefield. The cooperative play is exceptionally good. Most environments are wide-open spaces that allow a full team of four to clobber enemies in style, and you can also up the difficulty with your friends to get better rewards and make the battles more dynamic.You are pushed to earn better gear to raise each of the heroes’ overall power ratings, which you need to tackle harder missions. You may have a power rating of 12, yet need 50 to stand a chance in a particular side mission. Crystal Dynamics clearly has played some Destiny, since the loot system, various currencies, factions, and hub world are nearly identical in concept.Most of the gear you gain isn’t shown cosmetically, and the influx of items makes the experience drag. Getting a +1 spinal cord for Hulk is just weird, and does +1 really make a difference? Sure, the loot makes heroes more potent, but it just isn’t fun to collect.Outside of legendary items, the one category of loot that is instantly satisfying is costumes. Crystal Dynamics loaded up on different outfits for each hero, and a lot of them are great nods to Marvel’s comic books. Getting the costumes either requires grinding to earn currency (of which there is an unnecessarily confusing variety), making progress on the Challenge Card (Avengers’ equivalent of a battle pass system), or getting a blueprint to fabricate.Nothing really comes quick in Avengers. I wouldn’t call the process a slog, as I had a good time playing missions with friends. However, it goes slowly, making it seem like the structure is designed for you to spend real money to progress faster.Crystal Dynamics wants you to play this game for years to come, and Avengers has plenty of content to keep you engaged at launch, but replaying missions on higher difficulties to get better gear won’t be enough down the road. It doesn’t have the competitive hooks of similarly designed games like Destiny. A steady drip of new stories and missions will be needed along with the announced heroes. Avengers is in great shape right now, dazzling with its story and action. I’m hooked on the end-game content that is available now, and I want to see just how powerful these heroes can become after leveling them completely.Avengers, assemble! You have a great game to play!

Marvel's Avengers,Laura Kate Dale,Polygon,https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/9/4/21422679/marvels-avengers-review-ps4-xbox-pc-stadia-campaign-multiplayer,"Filed under:A game trying to be many things at onceMarvel’s Avengers isn’t the game I expected.  Marvel’s Avengers is a big budget, Ms. Marvel-focused single-player game that just so happens to have the main cast of the Avengers along for the ride. It eventually pivots to try and become a Destiny competitor after the story is finished, but that story-focused campaign is a much larger part of the overall experience than I had imagined. The game’s latter, live-service portions do show promise, but the road between the game’s two halves is currently very rocky.Players are given two choices on the game’s main menu: campaign and Avengers Initiative. The Avengers Initiative option allows players to skip the game’s plot missions entirely and jump straight to the multiplayer, loot-grinding content. The game warns against doing this, however, and I agree.Besides, the single-player campaign is where I had the most fun with the game, by far.  Kamala Khan’s Ms. Marvel is the protagonist of Marvel’s Avengers, contrary to the game’s marketing, demos shown at trade shows, and even the game’s beta last month. The single-player campaign is her story. Khan is basically an over-excited, nerdy teenage fangirl with a bit of an Avengers obsession. Khan is our audience surrogate, someone just really excited to see the Avengers doing cool stuff, and who wishes she could be involved too. She’s a fanfiction-writing teenager who jumps and squeals with joy at seeing her heroes in person. She’s also a Pakistani-American Muslim, with a dorky, overprotective father and her own culturally relevant perspective on moral duty.What makes Ms. Marvel work as this game’s main character is that she hasn’t really been explored in the Marvel Cinematic Universe yet, and has space to have her own narrative arc here that doesn’t feel like it’s treading on the toes of those movies. While the rest of the Avengers all have roles to play in the game’s story mode, most of them are stuck on the periphery. It’s assumed that you already know who these heroes are, and what they’re all about. She’s only the character who gets to have an arc, and grow, and develop as the game progresses, outside of the game’s villain.The plot set up for Marvel’s Avengers is basically a take on the Inhumans story from the comics. Due to a disastrous event seemingly caused by the Avengers, a bunch of regular humans unexpectedly develop super powers all across the American West Coast. Some of these are beneficial, and some of them are people catching on fire uncontrollably. The Avengers are blamed, these new “inhumans” are treated as inherently dangerous, and the AIM corporation takes on the task of tracking down these newly created super-powered individuals. It’s not a matter of if AIM will come for an Inhuman, but when.

  The single-player campaign is largely a simplistic power fantasy. Some missions have you play as specific characters, but you’ll often be able to pick from any characters currently present in the story to play as. Here are a few waves of robots, so smash them apart with a mix of light and heavy attacks mixed with dodges. Maybe an occasional enemy will have a shield, you might have to do a ranged attack on a turret, or you will on occasion have a boss fight that requires more thoughtful combat, but the single-player encounters are about feeling like a cool, powerful superhero. It feels a lot like playing a Marvel-themed Dynasty Warriors game at its best moments; you’re powerful as hell and are let loose to mow down waves of enemies that don’t stand a chance against you. Get in, let nothing stop you, get out.A big part of this simplicity is due to the fact that even by the end of the single-player campaign, you’ll have barely scratched the surface of most characters’ upgrade skill trees. As you play through the campaign or post-game missions, you gain experience in the background, occasionally earning skill points to spend on new abilities. While some abilities are locked behind leveling progression, you’ve usually got multiple upgrade options available at a given time, spread across different aspects of your character. There are separate upgrade trees for light attacks, heavy attacks, ranged attack, and special abilities, with upgrades ranging from new combos, to attacks that break through new kinds of defenses.Kamala Khan is basically our window into life as an inhuman. Very early in the game she’s on the run, judged as being dangerous simply for who she is, despite not having actually done anything wrong. Considering her character is a Muslim living in modern day America, she makes for an interesting window into the struggles of the Inhumans, with a perfect motivation to want to try and change things when even the Avengers have given up. She knows what it’s like to be seen as dangerous just for being herself, but she’s also idealistic and optimistic, and that really helps keep the core “the Avengers disbanded” narrative from getting too hopeless. The single-player campaign in Marvel’s Avengers is occasionally a little bit predictable, but the story managed to keep me on my toes even in the moments I could see a plot twist was on the way. Even when I knew something was coming, I never quite knew what it would be. I don’t want to spoil who the game’s main villain is, for those who have avoided spoilers thus far, but I will say I very much enjoyed that the game made use of one of Marvel’s more ridiculous and over-the-top characters for this story. They went with a villain who the MCU has not yet touched, and did a great job bringing them to life.The campaign in Marvel’s Avengers is around 12 hours long, and I was honestly surprised by how separated it felt from the game’s eventual live service content. If you are only interested in picking up Marvel’s Avengers as a single-player, action-adventure and dropping it as soon as that’s done, you can totally do that. Sure, you will have to put up with the game constantly reminding you with on-screen prompts that you’re not using the highest level gear for your character, but that’s about it. While some plot-based missions take place in environments I would revisit in the post-game content, a decent percentage of missions are crafted experiences, designed for specific characters and integrated into the plot in meaningful ways. Missions like sneaking through a memorial park to outrun the shadowy organization AIM, putting Iron Man’s suit together while under attack, or outrunning the Hulk in a crowded and unfamiliar space delivered compelling action, especially in the context of the wider narrative. The story mode isn’t simply plot painted over multiplayer maps, in other words.

  By the end of my time with the single-player campaign, most of my characters were level 10, out of a current level cap of 50, with probably two-thirds of their combat abilities not yet unlocked. Most of your coolest attacks, and most of the attacks designed to deal with more complex enemy patterns, are likely to elude you during the single-player campaign, and it feels like enemy difficulty is set to match that experience. The story mode is more about putting you in cool situations, rather than giving you a glimpse of the mechanically coolest things each character can do.But the most notable issue during my playthrough was a series of technical bugs, glitches, and performance issues. From multiple cutscenes where a hero’s hair or face failed to render, to a level where voice clips were stuck playing on loop, a game-breaking crash when walking through a door, to a faction rewards alert filling up my screen during an emotional late-game cutscene, I was frequently shocked by the number of unpolished edges in the game. Most of these issues were manageable, they just felt at odds with the game’s ambition. But overall, I thought the single-player campaign was enjoyable. From watching Kamala wrestle with feeling inadequate when suddenly thrust into working beside her idols, to the way the designers slowly reveal how bad things are getting for the Inhumans, and the small, joyous road trip interactions to the dramatic action set-pieces, it feels like a very human experience. Considering how much of the plot is centered on reducing the humanity of the Inhumans, it feels important that endearing human interactions are at the core of the story.So, once you’ve finished playing through the single-player campaign, how is the endgame  content? Well, the game has promise, even if the transition between single-player and live service is off-putting. When you initially finish up the game’s campaign, players are given a variety of missions to tackle, some more plot-based than others. While there is a continued story to explore once the credits have rolled, it is a far less guided affair, with a much less urgent sense of pace. A new villain is introduced without much fanfare, the reasons you’re sent on missions become more generic, and everything feels noticeably less structured. My first few hours after the credits rolled felt like I had been taken from the power fantasy and thrown into content I was under-leveled for. It was weird seeing The Hulk suddenly being taken out by a handful of basic enemies because their stats were higher than mine. I hadn’t yet unlocked the new moves and attacks I needed to make the transition into the post-game’s higher-challenge missions, and the first few hours soured me on the experience until I had time to adjust.Many of the post-game missions take place in identical buildings, placed into differing overworld locations. Every underground vault where I have to hack terminals to access resources has an identical interior. Every AIM base I infiltrate features the same three corridors leading to a large encounter space. You’ll be expected to visit the same location in two back-to-back missions and believe it’s actually two separate locations, because that’s what your mission briefing told you. Missions in the post-game all feature a fairly similar structure. Get dropped into a big overworld map, go find some optional loot chests if you feel up to it, defeat a wave of enemies guarding either a door or a mechanism that needs to be destroyed, maybe stand on some glowing squares to hack a computer, beat up some more enemies, repeat. It’s formulaic, and the kind of experience that lives or dies by you having fun with the moment-to-moment combat, outside of any plot motivation you might have for being there. When it’s working well, the fun is in seeing how quickly and effectively you can steamroll a room full of enemies. Then you get rewarded with some upgrade resources, or a new piece of gear, or some credits toward a new outfit, and continue.

  I stuck with a single character for a while, tackling the same handful of plotless missions over and over, focused on unlocking more of their skill tree, and eventually the post-game difficulty settled down a little. I don’t tend to picture third-person brawling games this way, but I had to level grind a little, and unlock some more moves, before playing the new story content felt manageable. New gear for all your heroes is plentiful, but ultimately feels a bit meaningless in the early post-game missions. Sure, I can get a new ribcage for The Hulk (yes, the Hulk gets new bones as mission rewards for some reason), break down any hulk ribs that have a smaller level than my current gear, then use resources from those broken down ribs to raise the level of my best set of ribs, but the act never feels like it’s making me more powerful. Moving from a level-22 belt for Thor, to a level-28 belt rarely makes any impact I can notice in the heat of battle. Some gear has specific bonuses, such as resistance to certain damage types or buffs to some attacks, but the bonus amounts are so small in the early post-game it’s tough to feel their impact.The gear system seems bolted onto the experience, without much care for how it connects to the narrative, or these characters. Beyond leveling up to get new moves, which does make me feel more powerful, I don’t feel any great excitement yet when stumbling on rare, high-level loot.Marvel’s Avengers works well as a flashy single-player action-adventure if that’s all you’re looking for, particularly if you’re already a fan of Ms. Marvel, and I can see value in picking it up for that alone. I’m a bit skeptical of the live service aspect’s ability to keep me grinding for loot once I hit the level cap, or finish the story-themed post-game missions, but now I’m over that initial hurdle, it is kind of fun to bash waves of enemies with friends.On a good day, Marvel’s Avengers is a multiplayer Marvel-themed Dynasty Warriors game, and if you’re in the right mood, that’s a decent way to spend some hours, and we don’t know where the team will take it from here. On a great day, it’s a strong single-player outing for one of my favorite under-appreciated superheroes. Whichever of the two you’re hoping for, there’s fun to be found here, if you set your expectations right. While the multiplayer may not have come out the gate swinging, there’s room for it to level grind a little over the coming weeks, and hopefully become more impressive at some point down the line.Marvel’s Avengers is out now on Google Stadia, PlayStation 4, Windows PC, and Xbox One.

Marvel's Avengers,Mike Fahey,Kotaku,https://kotaku.com/marvels-avengers-the-kotaku-review-1844999094," There are many things I do not like about Marvel’s Avengers, one of the best comic book video games I’ve played. I don’t like grinding missions to earn more powerful equipment so I can take on more difficult missions. I don’t like my heroes’ inventories slowly filling with junk until I have to pause the game and spend 30 seconds dismantling useless garbage. I don’t like having to pick up faction missions in two different social spaces separated by minutes of loading. I don’t like spending five minutes traveling to a mission location only to have the game lock up completely, forcing me to restart. I don’t like endlessly repeating the same handful of boss battles against foes a full team of seasoned Avengers should be able to make short work of. But none of that can top the feeling of Thor’s hammer slamming into a robot’s metal body, Captain America’s shield flying true, Iron Man’s rockets hitting home, the Hulk’s Earth-shaking rage, Black Widow’s sting, and Ms. Marvel’s shapeshifting fists and feet. In the heat of battle, even a battle I’ve fought a dozen times, the sheer joy of being one of Earth’s mightiest heroes drowns out all of those little irritations. When I play Marvel’s Avengers I am a superhero. That’s exactly what I wanted out of Crystal Dynamics’ third-person comic book adventure. It helps that the game’s story campaign is basically a 10-12 hour superhero onboarding process led by one of the best new comic characters in decades, Kamala “Ms. Marvel” Khan. The Inhuman teen with her stretchy powers and boundless optimism is the perfect bridge between fans and heroes, being both herself. Without Kamala, there’d be no Avengers. The game opens on A-Day, a special event celebrating the esteemed super team. A young Kamala Khan is there, hoping to win an award for her Avengers fan-fiction, when disaster strikes. While the Avengers are distracted by an attack on San Francisco’s Golden Gate bridge, the experimental Terrigen reactor powering the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier serving as a fairground for A-Day overloads. The resulting explosion takes up a large portion of the city and seemingly causes the death of Captain America. Losing their leader and blamed for the disaster by the public, the Avengers disband. Five years later, teenage Kamala Khan stumbles across information suggesting the A-Day disaster was a setup. Transformed by the Terrigen mists into the shapeshifting Ms. Marvel, Kamala sets off on an adventure to bring her heroes back together to face the ever-growing threat of evil science organization A.I.M.Kamala is the heart of Marvel’s Avengers. Her enthusiasm and dauntless spirit are what drive the player as they slowly re-assemble the disassembled super team. I wasn’t as excited to unlock Iron Man or Black Widow as playable characters in the campaign as I was to see how Kamala reacted to them. The narrative isn’t quite as charming when the focus shifts to the more established heroes toward the second half of the campaign. As entertaining as Stark and Banner’s bickering is, I miss having my stretchy young hero by my side, providing her newbie hero perspective. Fortunately, the main narrative sticks the landing perfectly. I’d explain how, but that would be telling. The campaign is broken up into a series of missions. Kamala and the growing roster of the restored Avengers set out from their helicarrier base, attempting to thwart A.I.M.’s evil plan to harvest Inhuman powers to create an army of super androids. They’re dispatched to either high-tech A.I.M. bases, free-roaming wilderness areas dotted with A.I.M. installations, or the odd cityscape crawling with A.I.M. goons. There’s generally a main objective, like infiltrating a specific base, with a bunch of optional objectives achievable along the way. It’s up to the player to either make a beeline for their goal or wander about hunting for more powerful gear and other rewards before each mission’s main event. There’s a lot of re-use of terrain and locations going on, but that’s not painful until the post-campaign mission grind kicks in.During the campaign, I was too busy embiggening, smashing, thwacking, bashing, shooting, swinging, and flying to care too much about repetitive scenery. Fighting in Marvel’s Avengers is delightfully brutal. Punches and kicks have tangible impact. One can almost feel the recoil from Iron Man’s missile launchers. Being a third-person game and not an overhead affair like the Marvel Ultimate Alliance games, the action here is intimate and immediate. I haven’t felt as cool playing Captain America since 2011’s Captain America: Super-Soldier, the Sega game everyone forgets. And while I wish this version of the Hulk had the wall-scaling ability of the brute from 2005’s The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction, I understand some sacrifices have been made to balance this team-based adventure. It wouldn’t be nearly as fun if every mission started off with Iron Man rocketing directly to the objective, so he has to fly slowly. It bugs me a little as a comic book nerd, but I get it. ""Some Assembly Required""Squad Goals SimulatorBeing the Avengers. Fighting as the Avengers. My new best friend, Kamala Khan. Endgame grindy bits, the odd lock up. Crystal DynamicsPlayStation 4 (played), Xbox One, PC, StadiaSeptember 4, 2020Played campaign to the end of the main story and beyond, 69 percent complete. Played dozens of multiplayer missions. Leveled up Thor because Ari Notis wouldn't stop talking about that one Thor mission. What I really love is the different play styles within each individual character. In co-op, I have teamed up with players who charge into battle with Iron Man, flailing away with their fists and the odd laser blasts. My Iron Man is specced for missiles, so I like to hang back and rain down destruction. Were I more of a team player, I could spec my Ms. Marvel to have multiple charges of her heroic healing ability. I am not, so instead she kicks a lot more ass. Were Marvel’s Avengers just the campaign with a little co-op play and some character-specific side missions thrown in for good measure, I’d be perfectly satisfied. Crystal Dynamics could have stopped right there, maybe thrown in a bit of story DLC, and I would be the happiest Avengers fan ever. I’m still pretty damn happy, but I’m not a huge fan of the Destiny/Anthem-style multiplayer endgame. Once the campaign is over, you’re left with the “Avengers Initiative” post-campaign. It’s here I have to start travelling between the game’s two social spaces to pick up faction missions, grinding reputation so I can earn more powerful gear. Both the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier and the hidden base of the Inhuman resistance host faction coordinators who offer daily missions and assignments players can complete to earn faction reputation. The interface for accepting these missions gives me serious Destiny vibes. Meanwhile, missions are doled out via the war table. It’s a holographic map table filled with mission icons that would feel right-at-home in Anthem’s Fort Tarsis.See the icons with check marks beneath them on the map? Those are missions I’ve already completed. They are also missions the game would like me to repeat at higher difficulty levels for greater rewards. I understand there are folks out there who crave these sorts of grindy service games, but that’s not me. I’m almost jealous of my more games-as-service loving coworkers for getting more out of the game than I do.But I have gotten plenty out of Marvel’s Avengers. I’m still playing on a regular basis, not to level up my characters, but to enjoy the thrill of cutting loose as my favorite heroes. I’m looking forward to future character additions and the narrative missions they will bring. Some of the game’s character-specific side stories plant seeds that I’m really hoping come to fruition in future downloadable content. I’m also a huge fan of collecting alternate costumes, though not so much that I’d pay real money to do so. Even without its occasional glitches and hiccups, Marvel’s Avengers is no Spider-Man PS4. But Spider-Man PS4 only gives players the experience of playing as one superhero. That’s relatively easy. Avengers does a damn good job of bringing six wildly diverse superheroes to life, somehow making wielding the power of a literal god as satisfying as being a normal human shooting robots in the face with a pair of pistols. And there are more heroes on the way, including not one but two bow-and-arrow-sporting Hawkeyes. I can’t wait to take down a robotic tank with a piece of wood propelled by a taut string.Marvel’s Avengers isn’t the best comic book game out there, but it’s certainly the best team-based comic book game I’ve played. It’s not simply that it gathers iconic heroes together and lets me become them, but that each one of them is equally enjoyable. When the first couple of minutes of any session is spent picking out which character I want to play as, something has gone wonderfully right, which makes overlooking all the little things I don’t like that much easier. Marvel’s Avengers becomes a different game once you wrap up the campaign. Though the…When you think of the Avengers, you think Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Iron Man, and Black Widow,…Marvel’s Avengers, officially out today for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, send players directly…There’s a cloud hanging over Marvel’s Avengers.

Mack Ashworth 
MARVEL’S AVENGERS REVIEW FOR PC, PS4, XBOX ONE, AND GOOGLE STADIA. Following the sensational Endgame movie, the excitement surrounding the Avengers is surely at an all-time high. It seems like the perfect opportunity for this new Marvel’s Avengers game to swoop in and capitalize on the hype. Give the players Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, and Black Widow, throw in Ms. Marvel to keep things fresh, and let them play superheroes together. Sounds like a damn good time to me!Unfortunately, Marvel’s Avengers goes too far off-track to be saved by its heroes, resulting in a mostly functional, yet disappointing loot-based brawler. After 10 hours of campaign gameplay and 10 more hours of multiplayer, it’s time to get into it.Marvel’s Avengers’ campaign starts strong, with the fun introduction of superhero fan Kamala Khan attending an Avengers event in San Francisco. Our protagonist is a finalist in a fanfiction competition, which leads to her meeting the Avengers. She awkwardly interacts with the different heroes and it’s easy to fall in love with her wide-eyed enthusiasm. It’s also great how the heroes are aware of their comic book presence and influence, though this unique element is quickly dropped.After an optimistic beginning, chaos soon strikes San Francisco which spells disaster for superpowered beings, pejoratively referred to as “Inhumans,”  including the Avengers who end up broken and separated. Soon after, the player regains control of the now-stretchy Kamala Khan (Ms. Marvel) as she works to find the Avengers and fight back against a new enemy. Sadly, this new enemy is pretty boring by Marvel supervillain standards, backed up by lieutenants who aren’t much better.It’s unfortunate that, after 2-3 hours of promising content, where the focus is on a single or pair of characters, the game takes a jarring turn with its four-player missions that are filled with repetitive objectives. You have to endure 5-6 hours of clearing rooms and defending points with little in the way of exciting context before the final mission eventually pops up. This finale thankfully pulls things back to the more linear, focused mission design with cool set pieces, acting as a reminder of the game’s strong start, but it’s too little, too late.It’s as though another developer took over the reins partway through creation — which may have actually happened, given the “five core studios” working on this title — before giving them back for the story’s ending.Visually, the game looks serviceable. There are moments when you do want to stop and use the included photo mode, mainly during combat where the particle effects can get wild, but these are few and far between. It’s the environments that ultimately let the presentation down with the limited mix of barren wastelands and science lab corridors blurring together and rarely looking interesting.Animations can also get a little funky and bug out at times, to the point of evoking memories of jankier, pre-Arkham superhero games. It should look and feel like a step forward, but it doesn’t. Iffy animations paired with samey enemies and outrageously contrived objectives make Marvel’s Avengers feel behind where a 2020 game should be.Navigating the messy menus is a chore made worse by poor loading times. Even between tabs, there’s a hiccup while everything gets ready. Those poor loading times extend to the load screens, where you have to wait for an age for missions to get started. This is made worse when searching for players or trying to successfully invite friends.Using the “4K” option on my PS4 Pro, I found the 30 FPS limit to be more preferable to the inconsistent “Performance” mode. While the game was largely stable for the most part, there were moments of clear slowdown when large groups of enemies appeared onscreen. I fear for those playing on lesser hardware like the base PS4 and Xbox One, and look forward to the more stable performance on the next-gen versions.Despite the outrage aimed at the Marvel’s Avengers cast of heroes not looking like the Marvel Cinematic Universe actors, I found it pretty easy to get used to the character models and the voice actors. Sure, it’s initially jarring to see Iron Man replaced with a Robert Downey Jr. lookalike rather than the man himself, but that soon wears off. While they remain pretty flat personality-wise, in combat they all start to shine as you level them up and unlock new skills.Initially, combat feels like a step backward when compared to top-tier brawlers like the Batman: Arkham series or Marvel’s Spider-Man, which focus more on rhythm and timing. You don’t get that fluidity in Marvel’s Avengers and it can be frustrating to see your character going against your input. However, this game does lead to some satisfaction further down the line, as you learn more skills that can devastate the opposition and enhance your survivability. It’s just a shame that those initial levels are spent less like a hero and more like a coward, playing on the defensive and searching for health drops.While characters can feel a little samey at the start, the vast number of abilities to unlock eventually make them unique, with distinct roles. Playing as Iron Man, I know that I can fly around and take out pesky drones at the start of a fight. As the Hulk, I can deal big area-of-effect damage and juggle enemies in the air for the rest of my team to keep combos going. Once leveled up, Thor goes from being a God of War‘s Kratos wannabe to a big-damage thunder god with his own awesome combos and tricks.I’m sure Captain America, Black Widow, and Ms. Marvel can also dish out some tough love, as I’ve seen teammates use them to great effect. Of course, I’ll need to level them up myself to know for sure. Despite having 20 total hours played, I’m still far from getting everyone up to max level and a high Gear Score. The grind is pretty real and currently requires players to cycle through the same missions over and over again as the most efficient way to progress. Sure, other content is coming in the future, but it’s not here yet.Unfortunately, though the combat eventually becomes pleasing, there is little variety in the enemies you face or the areas you fight in. Mission modifiers can alter the challenge but rarely do they make the missions more enjoyable. In fact, they often make missions more frustrating, like the modifier that buffs incoming ranged attack damage! Combat in the tighter-focused story missions shines brightest, I feel, but it just doesn’t scale well when more friendlies and enemies are introduced.In a perfect scenario, matchmaking would work every time and you would get three other capable players whose heroes synergize well with your own choice. You’d combine efforts to stagger enemies and take them out in a coordinated assault. This rarely happens, however, with matchmaking often refusing to fill my party for one reason or another, and so A.I. characters take control. The friendly A.I. isn’t so bad and will revive you when you go down, but for an online co-op experience, there is bizarrely little in the way of actual online co-op.Quick Match can help you find other players, but you can only do that as a solo. My party of two couldn’t use this feature, which meant searching for players and usually only finding one person. This was tested during the launch weekend, but I still struggled to pull together full player parties.It also seems like the level scaling is a little out of wack. I had a low-level player join me and the game appeared to average out the mission level. So I would find the level very easy, while the other player found it incredibly difficult. That was a poor experience for both of us.So what about the loot in this loot-based brawler? The truth is that, until the extreme endgame, I rarely thought about it. I would just hold a button to automatically equip whichever items had the highest number assigned to them and then carry on playing. Gear drops don’t change your character’s appearance, either, making them even more forgettable.There are some interesting qualities to the loot in the buffs they provide and how they counter certain enemy types, but it means spending more time in the dreadful menus when I’d rather just be enjoying the combat. Of course, you can’t do that without equipping bigger-numbered Gear to do more damage, so you have to succumb to the notifications and interruptions.Gear Score is just so out of place in Marvel’s Avengers. It makes a bad first impression when it pops up in the Campaign and that stays with you until the true endgame grind, where you get Legendary Gear that can significantly shake up the way a character plays. A clone of the loot grind found in Destiny, The Division, and Anthem feels out of place here, resulting in convoluted systems that end up hindering the experience.What’s confusing is that there are also separate outfits that are purely cosmetic. In a perfect world where microtransactions haven’t influenced gameplay and overall player enjoyment, it would be these outfits that have different effects tied to them. Gear wouldn’t be a thing that players needed to worry about, as they could instead just equip Iron Man’s freeze-protection suit or Black Widow’s super stealth suit, or whatever. Then your teammates could identify your playstyle and skills by seeing what you’re wearing for a simpler, more streamlined experience.$60 gets you the base game. Then there’s a Marketplace where you can spend real money on expensive cosmetic items. Frankly, most of them look pretty generic and boring to me, to the point where it suggests a lack of creative freedom in regards to how developer Crystal Dynamics was able to use the Marvel license. Considering the number of different looks each character has had over the years, there are some incredibly plain additions here that don’t have fun with the Earth’s Mightiest Heroes.There are some interesting skins and nameplates locked behind each character’s “Challenge Card,” which acts like a Battle Pass. These are free for the included six heroes, but future characters’ Challenge Cards will be $10 each. Then there are vendors that you can buy Gear and cosmetic items from, but their prices seem extortionate and I’ve mostly avoided them. Gear vendors are a waste until the very end when you’re more desperate for certain Gear types, while cosmetic vendors just seem to be waiting for whales with money to burn.At the time of writing, a week after launch, the promise of new characters just means an even bigger grind to me. Thanks to Reddit and YouTube, and certainly not the actual game itself, I’ve worked out how to level up quickly. This endgame gameplay loop is unfortunately just a case of replaying the same short missions over and over. Once you’re at the soft cap of 130 Gear score, you’ll then need to use vast amounts of resources earned from missions and dismantling to boost that Gear further. This is all to prepare yourself for content that isn’t out yet.Midway through this grind, I found myself wanting to revisit some of the more linear, story missions and grab some collectibles. I was surprised and saddened to find that you can’t do that. (Collectible hunters will still be able to find missed collectibles in boxes during co-op missions.)Marvel’s Avengers is an identity crisis of a game. Moving from some excellent linear missions that capture Marvel fandom from the point of view of the fantastic Ms. Marvel, to a sudden smattering of seriously generic co-op missions featuring the most boring of enemies defending the most tedious of objectives, made me feel like I was moving between two entirely different games. Throw in the ultimately forgettable story populated by a handful of B-tier named supervillains, and this superhero game quickly descends into monotonous mission grinding for lackluster loot.In another timeline, this would have been a wholly linear experience, tightly paced with a fun narrative that focused entirely on Ms. Marvel’s growth as she sought out the different Avengers in exciting locations, both on Earth and off-world. This could have been complemented with an entirely separate co-op experience.Despite my criticisms, I do feel that there is at least a foundation for something better here. The heroes themselves become much more fun to play as you level them up and you do feel superpowered as you land a bunch of combos. So the combat is solid enough, and if the developer can use post-launch patches and content drops to add a wider variety of multiplayer missions, with more interesting objectives to complete, as well as more enjoyable enemies to fight, and more exciting rewards to earn through less of a grind or offensively high price tags, then I think Marvel’s Avengers has a shot at being a “Games as a Service” title that I’d like to eventually revisit. That seems like a monumental, get-all-six-Infinity-Stones-and-defeat-Thanos size of a task, though.Marvel’s Avengers was reviewed on PS4 Pro with code provided by the publisher.6Mack is slowly grinding his way to Level 100.

Marvel's Avengers,Chris Carter,Destructoid,https://www.destructoid.com/stories/review-marvel-s-avengers-601487.phtml,"darkAfter some time with the live version of Marvel’s Avengers, I realized that it had a lot to prove.Now that I’m finished with most of the content that the “1.0” edition has to offer, it still has plenty to prove.Marvel’s Avengers (PC, PS4 [reviewed], Xbox One)Developer: Crystal DynamicsPublisher: Square EnixReleased: September 4, 2020MSRP: $59.99So with the character factory that is Marvel, you might be wondering: “who’s in it?” Well, look directly above!Ms. Marvel is the charismatic star that leads back into the light, with Hulk, Iron Man, , Captain America, and Black Widow tagging along for the ride. Kate Bishop and Clint Barton are arriving after launch, with Spider-Man (exclusive to PlayStation) and more to follow. Straight-up, it needed another character at launch: not dangled as free eventual DLC. We’ll talk more about the homogenized cast later.As far as the narrative is concerned, Ms. Marvel does a decent job of trying to carry it on her shoulders with her wide-eyed approach to superheroism, but doesn’t manage to fully hold up all of the baggage involved. The voice acting, to put it mildly, is alright. There are some veteran actors in there, with Edmund Kingsley pulling off a spot-on JARVIS, but several (like the bro-ey Cap) simply do not work or allow you to be drawn into the characters in any meaningful way.The campaign, which is a roughly 10-hour separate component from the Destiny-like live service mode (more on that later too!), is all over the place. It’s a very linear and guided affair, that at times feels held back by the confines of the MCU or Marvel guidelines. No, it’s not directly based on the MCU (MODOK is in it after all), but it’s very clear that Square Enix, like other developers, is leaning hard into the appeal of the blockbuster film franchise.Part of the issue is that it’s almost solely focused on one faction that isn’t all that menacing. The Inhuman saga was always a polarizing aspect of the comics, and it’s front and center here, as are plenty of AIM robots. Putting Ms. Marvel at the focus was a smart move; Sandra Saad’s vocal performance serves as a proxy for the player, as we witness the nuances of each Avenger. Seeing her perspective (including the wonderful Avengers convention intro) is great. Walking in guided tunnels to slowly re-acquire classic comic book characters like currency, not so much.Even at 10+ hours, the campaign is slow-going. It might be ages until you get to play the hero you want, who may or may not actually meet the fantasy of said hero. The drama of the tired “outlawed superhero” angle is just not enough to justify this approach. For as many approval bodies as this likely had to go through at Marvel proper and Disney, it might be the best that Square Enix could do though, given the circumstances.When the game opens up a bit and allows you to embark on sandbox missions, it gets way more fun. There’s more room to screw around and strut your super stuff when you aren’t stopped every minute or so by dialogue or cutscenes that show cool confrontations but don’t actually let you play them outside of sparing QTEs. The Destiny comparison became more apparent the more I played it, as there’s even objectives like “protect the area” with restricted respawns and other action-centric goals tied to loot.Surprisingly, this is really where the game shines for me: where Marvel’s Avengers soars past its aggressively average presentation with the moment-to-moment slugfests. Loading up into a multiplayer mission, any mission, and seeing Hulk leap across your screen from one side while you fly around as Iron Man is a treat. Messy or not, this is some classic Marvel beat ’em up action come to life in the modern era.I don’t use the phrase “arcade-like” lightly, as the combat system could use more refinement. Breaking it down, everyone has a dial-a-combo with light and heavy attacks. Holding down the heavy button usually charges up some sort of smash that breaks shields, but you also have the option of dodging or triggering three specials (one of which is an ultimate ability). It’s very clear that the framework started as an homage to the Arkham Asylum series, but it never really blossomed from there.Heroes have some unique characteristics — especially when you level them up and gain skills — but the combo system for the most part remains constant and is the tie that binds them. Thor can throw his hammer and recall it. Iron Man can hover and shoot repulsor blasts. Hulk can grab people and fling them around. I can see where they were going with everything, as a few specials like Hulk’s Thunderclap look cool and feel true to the comics. But in-between those sessions where you’re beating up things and smiling, it can fall flat when everything you’re fighting is so homogenized.As enemies, AIM robots solve the “problem” of The Avengers straight-up murdering too many humans (you don’t have the “Spider-Man safely webs up all of the baddies after throwing them off a roof” solution here), but AIM never truly feels formidable. Whereas the Ultimate Alliance games weren’t afraid to get weird and throw all sorts of strange oddities at you at all turns, Marvel’s Avengers feels comparatively safe. Even in multiplayer, it can lead to a lot of “have I been here before?” gut feelings.I also dabbled in the endgame and I’m not exactly inspired to keep going. Battle passes, which are doled out for each individual character — free for the starting lineup but $10 for each DLC addition — are slow-going and feel like a grind. There are only a few vendors available in the endgame, and gear (which often lacks personality) and resource acquisition are similarly grindy. Several outfits are outrageously priced and low in quality.When Avengers isn’t getting in the way of itself with its tacked-on campaign, it’s a bit of silly arcade fun. If a lot of these concerns are answered via post-launch patches and the DLC characters are fun to play, there’s plenty of room for improvement with Avengers. At launch, it’s not going to wow everyone. Maybe Marvel wanted this out as soon as possible, but it could have used another delay.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]AlrightSlightly above average or simply inoffensive. Fans of the genre should enjoy them a bit, but a fair few will be left unfulfilled.

Marvel's Avengers,Donovan Erskine,Shacknews,https://www.shacknews.com/article/120164/marvels-avengers-review-excelsior,"New to Shacknews? Signup for a Free AccountAlready have an account? Login NowMarvel's Avengers combines the iconic heroes with one of gaming's hottest genres. Our Review.Thanks to the MCU, the Avengers have gone from being a really cool comic book team to one of the most beloved properties in the pop culture pantheon. With the rise in prominence of these characters, so have fan expectations risen when it comes to new adaptations. Developed by Crystal Dynamics and published by Square Enix, Marvel’s Avengers looks to take everything that fans love about Earth’s Mightiest Heroes, and assemble it into something special. The story in Marvel’s Avengers is entirely new and unique, not deriving from any past films or graphic novels. Centering around Kamala Khan, Avengers superfan, we get an outside look at the beloved superhero team. Visiting the Avengers Helicarrier for A-Day, an event celebrating the opening of the Avengers’ west coast HQ, Kamala gets to meet the heroes that she idolizes dearly. In true comic book fashion, things quickly go awry.  An attack on the city sees several structures destroyed, as well as a large loss of civilian life, including that of a certain hero. During the attack, the Terrigen Crystal is destroyed, spreading an Inhuman infection across the population. Five years later, and the Avengers are now defunct. After being blamed for the tragic events of A-Day, the groups’ activities are outlawed. Many civilians across America have been infected with the Inhuman disease, granting them undesired powers. And the mysterious AIM organization has stepped forward, promising to develop a cure for the Terrigen mist disease.Five years older, we jump back into the life of Kamala Khan. A bit more mature and with some newly acquired powers (thanks to the events of A-Day), Kamala is obsessed with clearing the Avengers name. She goes on a journey to reassemble Earth’s Mightiest Heroes, and uncovers some dark secrets along the way. The campaign in Marvel’s Avengers is a terrific adaptation of a beloved property. It’s packed with emotion, drama, and twists, without ever feeling like a ripoff of the MCU or one of many classic comic book runs. One of my greatest concerns going in was that Crystal Dynamics would nervously follow in the footsteps of something we’ve already seen, but they instead tell their own new and unique story.Kamala Khan is what really anchors the narrative in Marvel’s Avengers. Choosing Kamala as a protagonist, rather than Iron Man or Captain America, allows players to experience an Avengers story from a fresh perspective. In the game, Kamala is so filled with hope and determination in a world that’s completely given up on itself, which rings so true to the character. The role is taken to the next level thanks to an excellent performance from Sandra Saad.Kamala’s journey finding and recruiting members of the Avengers is a fun ride. The character interactions feel so accurately portrayed. Many of the Avengers are cold and standoffish to one another, but are considerably kinder and more understanding of Kamala. Working to clear the Avengers’ name while also discovering the truth behind the events of A-Day makes for a worthy addition to a long list of Avengers stories.The combat in Marvel’s Avengers feels like a highly-polished brawler. I often found myself spamming attacks and plunging into crowds of enemies and just wrecking shop. This would be a pretty standard, serviceable combat system, but the heroes themselves is what takes it above and beyond. Just like the story accurately adapts and represents the personalities of the Avengers, the combat is pinpoint accurate in depicting each of their independent fighting styles. Fighting 20 enemies as the Hulk is entirely different than battling the same group as Black Widow. Hulk can pick up enemies and repeatedly slam them into the ground, or use them as projectiles to stun and damage others. Black Widow, on the other hand, lights things up with dual-wielded pistols, able to quickly jump in and out of the action with her grappling hook.A personal favorite of mine was Thor. Swinging Mjölnir around and nailing enemies feels weighted, and incredibly satisfying. Thor also has the ability to throw and recall Mjölnir as he pleases. The combat in Marvel’s Avengers is able to work because each hero feels uniquely defined, with their own independent skills and abilities. Once the campaign is complete, players are urged to take their skills online and battle alongside others. Titled “Avengers Initiative,” this is where Marvel’s Avengers is meant to live on as a live service. Players can engage in a variety of missions that range in difficulty, rewarding the player with gear that they can equip and upgrade their heroes with. While the mode is alright in its current state, there is some work to do in order to make Avengers Initiative a must-play experience. Upon completing missions in both the campaign and multiplayer modes, players will receive gear that they can equip to their heroes. Gear provides statistical bonuses to attack and defense as well as other specific traits, such as increased damage for signature attacks. Gear comes in six qualities: common, uncommon, rare, epic, legendary, and exotic. A character’s gear loadout will increase their power level, allowing them to properly take on tougher missions.The process of completing missions, earning gear, and leveling up is a satisfying gameplay loop, but it lacks that wow-factor of the campaign and combat. The UI feels extremely convoluted, with a seemingly countless number of menus and submenus to dig through. You’ll often realize that you’ve got gear that you didn’t know about, because it's over in an entirely different inventory menu because your current slots are filled. Or, that you haven’t upgraded your ultimate ability because you’ve got to flip through pages to find that skill tree. There’s a solid, much easier to understand experience in there, but it feels like Crystal Dynamics isn’t quite there yet.I also experienced issues trying to queue into matches and play with friends, as we would freeze standing around the War Table, or the game would tell players that a character is locked, that isn’t. Luckily for Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics, most of my issues with Avengers Initiative are entirely fixable. Once you’re actually in a mission, working alongside friends, you see the charm of Marvel’s Avengers’ multiplayer. Charging into a massive wave of enemies and dealing some damage as a unit just feels epic. It’s the exact level of over-the-top action that you want from an Avengers game. I did experience some framerate drops when playing on PS4, but luckily nothing that made the game feel unplayable. What really impressed me when playing online was the way that you can organically combine the unique abilities of a character with other heroes to work together. For example, when playing as Thor, I threw Mjölnir at an enemy flying around in a jetpack. He was immediately slammed to the ground, unable to move from beneath the godly hammer. My friend, who was playing as Captain America ran over and began to attack the defenseless enemy with his shield, making for an easy kill. When playing as Iron Man, you can call down the iconic Hulkbuster suit. However, Iron Man doesn’t necessarily have to be the one to enter the suit. In one instance, Iron Man called down the suit, and the Hulk jumped into the Hulkbuster, letting him take advantage of all the suit’s bonuses. It’s moments like these that will sell you the multiplayer in Marvel’s Avengers, as it did with me.Marvel’s Avengers impresses with a well-written, dramatic campaign. From a gameplay standpoint, the combat is as fun and satisfying as one could hope for in a title based on the superhero team. Though the online live service aspect is bogged down by overly complicated menus, systems, and matchmaking woes, there’s still a fun experience underneath. Crystal Dynamics and Square Enix deliver a perfectly adequate adaptation of an iconic property with Marvel’s Avengers.This review is based on a digital download code provided by the publisher.

Marvel's Avengers,Diego Perez,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/marvels-avengers-review/,"I have a lot of conflicting feelings about Marvel’s Avengers. After finishing the campaign and getting two of the game’s six heroes to the current power cap of 150, I’ve experienced the highest of highs and the lowest of lows with this game. Marvel’s Avengers is not a particularly great game, but it’s one I haven’t been able to stop playing. Following in the footsteps of spectacular solo superhero releases like Marvel’s Spider-Man and the Batman Arkham series, Marvel’s Avengers has incredibly tough shoes to fill, and despite countless issues, it still manages to deliver on the superhero team-up fantasy that every comic book fan dreams of.There are two games at the core of Marvel’s Avengers. There’s an Uncharted style linear campaign filled with endearing character moments and action-packed setpieces, and then there’s a live service Destiny style co-op game focused on loot and gear. These can mostly be enjoyed independently of one another, but one side clearly wins out over the other. Marvel’s Avengers is not a single-player action game with tacked on live service elements; it’s a live service game with an exceptionally good single-player campaign. That’s an important distinction to make here, because your expectations going into Marvel’s Avengers will drastically affect your enjoyment of the game.Marvel’s Avengers easily has the best story out of any live service game I’ve ever played. That’s not an incredibly high bar to pass, but I was very surprised by how engaging the Avengers campaign actually was. In the weeks leading up to release, I was sure the game’s cast would be nothing more than MCU knockoffs. However, by the time the credits rolled, they ended up becoming some of my favorite renditions of these characters in any medium. It can be difficult to not hear Nathan Drake when Iron Man cracks a joke during a fight, but Nolan North knocks it out of the park as Tony Stark. The same can be said for the rest of the group, especially Troy Baker’s Hulk and Laura Bailey’s Black Widow. This is a unique take on the Avengers team that I can’t wait to see more from. Surprisingly enough though, the main Avengers aren’t the most compelling part of the story.Kamala Khan is this game’s secret weapon. Despite being an Avengers game by name, the Avengers campaign is for all intents and purposes a Ms. Marvel game. Not only is she the protagonist of this story, but she’s also the game’s most interesting character by a mile. Her growth from fangirl to fully-fledged hero is the campaign’s driving force, and her interactions with each of the Avengers and other supporting characters never fail to elicit a smile. It’s refreshing to see a major Marvel property incorporate a relatively new character in the grand scheme of things, and I cannot wait to see more from Kamala as the game grows and new heroes come into the fray.Kamala Khan is this game’s secret weapon.There cannot be superheroes without supervillains, however, and Marvel’s Avengers takes another risk in this department by going an entirely different route than most would expect. Rather than using a well-known antagonist from the MCU or other major Marvel movies, Marvel’s Avengers features MODOK as the primary villain of this story. Unfortunately, MODOK and the others from AIM aren’t especially compelling villains. They’re well-acted and performed like the rest of the characters, but they’re so blatantly evil that it can be difficult to empathize with them or even find them all that interesting in the first place. Nearly all of the character development in this story is reserved for the six playable characters, and it’s a bit disappointing that the villains felt throwaway in comparison.As Kamala works to reassemble the Avengers team and take down MODOK, you’ll play through several single-player missions that would feel right at home in any other big-budget superhero game. From the opening A-Day mission to many other setpiece moments, there is no shortage of excitement in the Avengers campaign. These tightly designed levels are the highlight of the campaign, but the live service nature of Marvel’s Avengers unfortunately rears its ugly head during the story. In between most big levels, you’ll be sent on what feel like side quests where the Avengers need to rescue Inhumans or gather supplies for their next big mission. These missions are there to introduce War Zones and other mission types that you’ll be interacting with later in the online part of the game, and they bring the pace of the single-player campaign to a screeching halt. The wide-open areas these missions take you to are clearly designed for multiplayer and they lack the tight level design or narrative stakes of the main missions. These are definitely the low points of the campaign, and they can be mind-numbingly boring at times.Combat in Marvel’s Avengers starts out deceptively simple. When first starting out with a hero, you’ll only have access to a few basic attacks and not much more. Once you reach the level cap though, things get much more complicated. The beta severely misrepresented this game’s combat. All six playable heroes have diverse movesets to learn and master, and some characters even have different weapons to swap between mid-combat. Black Widow has different guns she can equip and Iron Man can swap between repulsors, lasers, and rockets for example. Slowly unlocking each character’s full moveset and learning what they’re capable of is one of the best parts of Marvel’s Avengers.Each character is based on the same template, but they all feel radically different from one another. They all have the same controls and attack types, however, which makes transitioning between the six of them a breeze. Even though Hulk feels way different from Ms. Marvel, I was able to easily switch back and forth between the two without having to relearn a specific control scheme or playstyle. This ensures that you won’t feel too out of your element when trying out a new hero or if you need to swap characters to play with a friend.Each character has three pages of skill trees, but you end up having everything unlocked by the time you reach the max level. Certain skills have three options you can choose from, and this is where you can really make your character your own. You can specialize any hero any way you want, and when you synergize your skills with the right gear, you can create some pretty crazy builds. If you want to play a melee-focused Iron Man, you can do that. If you want to play a ranged Hulk, you totally can. It’s remarkable not only how different the heroes feel from one another, but also how different two versions of the same hero can be between players.Combat is surprisingly deep and challenging once you have access to a character’s full moveset, but there are certain aspects of it that can be frustrating. Ranged enemies are incredibly annoying to fight, and they can take you down in just a few shots. This wouldn’t be that big of an issue there weren’t a hundred things going on at once in Marvel’s Avengers. You’re constantly juggling multiple enemies and there are always particle effects and other clutter all over the screen, making it very frustrating when you get sniped mid-combo for half your health bar. The Avengers also feel way too weak. They get staggered and interrupted all the time while not being able to do the same to enemies. Challenge and difficulty are nice to have, but many things in Marvel’s Avengers just feel frustrating or unfair.It’s remarkable not only how different the heroes feel from one another, but also how different two versions of the same hero can be between players.After the campaign comes to a close, you enter the Avengers Initiative, which is the game’s multiplayer component. This is just a fancy name for the post-game, although the post-game in Marvel’s Avengers is a bit more complex than most. There’s technically an entire second post-game “campaign,” although it lacks much of the narrative focus and tight design of the actual single-player campaign. It mainly serves as a means of onboarding you into the endgame and unlocking some new mission types. You’ll run War Zone missions, defeat villains, and wrap up any Iconic missions for each of the six heroes you may have missed in the campaign. The main difference here is that you can play these missions with a group of four, and this is where the meat of Marvel’s Avengers is.Co-op play is the main draw of Marvel’s Avengers, and most of the game’s combat is designed around it. Those wide-open areas introduced during the campaign feel much better with a team of real players, and mindlessly beating up bad guys is much more tolerable with friends. Still, the game becomes incredibly repetitive very quickly at this stage. Without much of a story to follow or any real motivation to keep pushing you forward, the game quickly boils down to fighting the same few generic robots in the same handful of identical rooms and hallways. Even the War Zones, which have optional points of interest to explore for gear and loot, quickly become routine as you make your way toward the same set of question marks that spawn in the same locations every time.The game quickly boils down to fighting the same few generic robots in the same handful of identical rooms and hallways.Hives are one of the endgame activities in Marvel’s Avengers, and they exemplify this problem perfectly. Hives are essentially challenge gauntlets that send you through a number of floors with a specific objective on each one. There are so few objective types in this game that you will perform the same task multiple times in the same Hive. You can only “defeat the elite AIM team” so many times before it becomes mind-numbing. The co-op missions in this game have some of the worst level design I’ve seen in a long time, and fighting Synthoids in the same hallway for the twentieth time can get excruciatingly boring. The only thing that kept me going was the desire to hit the level cap and unlock all the moves for my characters. You have to really enjoy the combat to be able to put up with the onslaught of monotony.After hitting max level with your character and reaching the current power cap of 150, you enter the Avengers endgame. Like most games of this type, Marvel’s Avengers will live or die based on its endgame, and it is very poor in its current state. Right now, the endgame consists of running Villain Sectors and Hives to try and get gear with great perks. Considering gear does not have any effect on your character’s appearance, its worth is based entirely on the perks it has. While these perks are largely useless for the majority of Marvel’s Avengers, they start mattering at the endgame, and they can actually have a significant effect on your performance. I went from hating the fact that gear is not cosmetic to loving it by the level cap. This way, you can use whatever gear you want while still rocking your favorite Iron Man suit or Thor outfit.The problem with gear is that there just aren’t enough perks to keep things fresh. Every item you get starts to blend together in a mess of numbers and percentages. There is nothing to chase after. There is exotic gear to be found, but it’s functionally the same as everything else you’ve ever picked up. The percentages on the perks are just a little bit higher, and in some cases, regular legendary gear is just as good. Exotics in Marvel’s Avengers are nowhere near as exciting as those found in Destiny or any other similar games. Unless you really care about crafting the perfect build and min-maxing your characters, there is very little incentive to keep playing past the level cap.You can use whatever gear you want while still rocking your favorite Iron Man suit or Thor outfit.There’s also a shockingly small amount of content to run through. As I mentioned above, Hives are one of the main endgame activities in this game, but they get repetitive quickly and can even feature repeated objectives during the same mission. Villain Sectors are the other main endgame activity, pitting you against a powerful boss, but these are disappointingly few in number. There are only two villains in total, Taskmaster and Abomination, and the other Villain Sectors just feature generic giant robots as bosses. Even counting these robots, there are only four Villain Sectors in the game right now. There’s just not a whole lot to do in Marvel’s Avengers in its current state. Now, more content is on the way very soon, with AIM’s Secret Lab coming sometime in the next few weeks followed by Kate Bishop and Hawkeye with their own stories and missions, but the mission pool at launch is immensely underwhelming.This game really needed six more months in the oven. There is an unacceptable amount of bugs and glitches, and I keep running into new ones the more I play. Character models sometimes don’t load in, voice clips repeat endlessly, the subtitles don’t match what characters say sometimes, the list goes on and on. Visual and audio bugs that don’t affect gameplay are one thing, but there are also a ton of glitches that directly affect gameplay. Unlocked skins and outfits have been disappearing and reverting to their locked state for many players, myself included, and sometimes deciphering a pattern to unlock a new skin just makes the pattern disappear. Exotics are dropping at level 1 power for a lot of people. Currencies of all kinds have been disappearing from inventories. Hero Challenge Cards aren’t progressing for some. I have fallen through the world more times than I can count. This game is buggy to the point where it actively affects my enjoyment of it, and it really needs several big patches.Somehow, despite all the bugs and despite all the problems, I’m having a blast with Marvel’s Avengers. It’s not necessarily a great game, but it’s a good one. As long as I can live the day to day of an Avenger, walking around the Helicarrier and running missions for SHIELD, then I’m happy, and I imagine a lot of Marvel fans will be too. Unlike Marvel’s Spider-Man or the Batman Arkham games, Marvel’s Avengers is not particularly great at any one thing. Instead, it’s just okay at a lot of things. That’s all it really needs to be though. The promise of an ever-expanding Marvel universe has me excited for the future of Marvel’s Avengers, and the game in its current state is just engaging enough to make me want to keep playing in order to prepare for upcoming content.
- This article was updated on September 11th, 2020 Attack of the Fanboy / GAME REVIEWS / Marvel’s Avengers Review"
Marvel's Avengers,Mick Fraser,God is a Geek,https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/marvels-avengers-review/,"September 4, 2020When Crystal Dynamics and Square Enix first revealed their new Avengers game, I wasn’t sure what to think. The gameplay looked more than passable, but those faces, those voices… The character models made me weirdly uneasy, like I was looking at bad waxworks. No, worse, like my 5 year old was showing me drawings he’d done of his favourite heroes and I had to nod and smile so as not to discourage him. The beta went some way towards getting me onboard, reassuring me that even if I couldn’t get fully used to the faces, at least the gameplay was my kind of nearly-mindless grind. Now, having spent some considerable time with Marvel’s Avengers, I can honestly say the faces don’t bother me anymore. I’ve been having a blast.There are caveats to that, of course. Lots of them. This is a game with many flaws, none overly damaging, but very few that are totally ignorable either. And yet at the same time it seems to have achieved what it set out to achieve. It could have done with a few more months in the proverbial oven, and the endgame needs some work, but on the whole Marvel’s Avengers is a pretty good time.The campaign centres around the events of A-Day, when the Avengers failed to prevent a catastrophe that resulted in their public admonishment and disavowal. It also left many people altered on a genetic level, exhibiting powers like the X-Men mutations. One such is teenager Kamala Khan, known in the greater Marvel universe as Ms Marvel (no relation to Captain). An Avengers mega-fan at A-Day to submit her fan fiction comic, she is caught in the blast and subsequently develops the ability to stretch and reshape her body like Mr. Fantastic.Unable to accept the fate of her favourite heroes, Kamala has spent the last five years trying to prove that the Avengers were not to blame and that the company who stepped in, AIM (Advanced Idea Mechanics) is not what it seems. Before long she’s on the quest to reunite the Avengers, defeat AIM (led by the Scientist Supreme, Monica Rappacini and supervillain MODOK). This results in a solid 8-ish hour campaign that sees you flitting between Kamala and the Avengers in both story and side missions.I say “solid” because the campaign is perhaps the most consistent element in Marvel’s Avengers. While most of the missions are a straight mix of running, jumping, and brawling, it remains enjoyable throughout, helped along by some surprisingly watchable cutscenes. The character models take a while to get used to, but the writing is good, doing an admirable job of replicating the personalities of each Avenger as presented in the MCU. The banter is believable, the jokes and jibes mostly hit the spot, and whenever it takes on a more serious tone the actors do a commendable job. The guy behind Bruce Banner in this game is especially worthy, as is Kamala Khan. Despite being a bit of an over-the-top fangirl in the opening hours, she begins to mature as the story progresses, and by the halfway point I had warmed to her completely.Every mission involves a certain amount of combat against multiple enemies. Big mobs are the order of the day, and whichever Avenger you choose to play as the action is satisfying and cathartic, even if it is way too messy at times. Enemies, scenery, particle effects, explosions, and debris fly around you like you’re at the centre of a hurricane, and when you add other Avengers into the mix, either AI or player controlled, the framerate can tank hard. It rarely lasts long and didn’t ruin anything for me, but it definitely struggles at times.Perhaps Crystal Dynamics’ biggest triumph is nailing the feel of each Avenger. Concessions have been made for the sake of balancing: if you could literally wreck everything and be nigh invincible as the Hulk or Thor, why would you play as Black Widow? Watching Hulk get smacked about by relatively puny robots is a bit weird, but this is a video game after all. The synergy between characters would also be a lot more impressive if only you could see through the sparks and shrapnel during fights, but it’s endlessly satisfying to stun an enemy with Nat’s Spider Bite right as Hulk thunderclaps them into oblivion, and Iron Man being able to summon and then allow someone else to pilot Veronica is a very cool touch.If Avengers has a major problem right now it’s the endgame and multiplayer. The Avengers Initiative mode is pretty bare bones, and part of that is down to the poor rewards and lack of variety. It’s good you can unlock character-specific loot, but cosmetics are still locked (and we’ll come to that shortly) and the missions are so repetitive that it’s hard to keep playing for sustained periods. More focused, Destiny-like Strike missions or even more dynamic objective lists would help a lot in the multiplayer missions. At present, most missions are just you beating enemies snotless while holding control points or rescuing hostages.Thankfully, the campaign is great, mixing in a decent variety of mission types with a few interesting one-offs thrown in. Iron Man has a few of my favourite sequences, speeding through bullet hell gauntlets or fighting against a raging storm to break through the atmosphere, and the boss fights might be long affairs but they’re mostly pretty fun. None are overly taxing, but they make good use of the available space and force you to use your character’s powers to succeed.Each Avenger has three powerful Hero abilities that can be modified as you upgrade them. Assigned to the left and right triggers, with the Ultimate ability requiring both, these are designed to turn the tide in a scrape. For instance Kamala, can restore a percentage of her health with one skill, while her Ultimate causes her to “embiggen” and do way more damage. Iron Man can call down Veronica with his Ultimate, while Widow pulls out a bo-staff and goes ham, using her other abilities to cloak herself or shock the enemy. Each ability is intrinsically tied to a specific character, which adds another layer of personality to each.Because it’s 2020, Square Enix have seen fit to drop a great big bone of contention in the middle of an otherwise fairly tasty salad, by giving each character a Challenge Card. This looks very much like a battle pass for every hero, which has caused all kinds of controversies, but as MTX models go, it’s not the worst. To clarify, this is roughly analogous to saying a small turd isn’t the worst thing you could find on your pillow of a morning, and I’m not condoning MTX models in any way. But honestly, the one in Marvel’s Avengers doesn’t seem too problematic so far.Essentially each character in Marvel’s Avengers has daily and weekly challenges that award points, and these points unlock boxes on the Challenge Card containing nameplates, emotes, takedown moves and, crucially, outfits. The initial six heroes are all unlocked at launch, meaning you can earn their “Premium tier” rewards by spending points alone, but for additional heroes you’ll need to spend 1000 Credits to unlock this Premium tier. Credits can be earned by completing the already unlocked Cards, or of course, you can spend real money if you want to speed up the process. As it’s for cosmetics only, you really don’t need to do this.The only issue I can see so far is that earning these points takes a long time. After some rough calculations I’d say the average person could maybe complete a Challenge Card in 3 or 4 weeks, but again, these are optional extras that you’re not obligated to unlock. And there are outfits rewarded in the story or purchasable from an in-game store using virtual currency that you earn by completing missions and opening loot chests. It ain’t that bad, folks.What is bad, currently, is the loot game. Gear feels like an afterthought most of the time, and I find myself opening the menu and holding L2 to automatically equip the best gear without reading what any of it does. I’ve seen screenshots of people unlocking “Elite” gear in the endgame with some very cool effects and synergistic buffs, but I’m not at that level with any one character yet and may not be for a while. Not only does the loot not alter your appearance, but it has a bunch of stats and numbers on it that don’t seem to have much impact on the gameplay. Live service RPGs seem to unanimously struggle with getting loot and power levels right (Destiny 2 is undergoing a bunch of changes for Beyond Light three years after launching, and The Division 2 is… Wait – is The Division 2 still a thing?), and Avengers is no different.Had Crystal Dynamics taken a bit more time to iron out bugs and glitches, and had the monetisation and ridiculous pre-order bonus nonsense not been thrust front and centre during the marketing phase, Avengers would be weathering a lot less flak right now. It’s a great game held back by a bit of a wonky engine and an aimless multiplayer mode, both of which will be fixed in due course, I’m sure. The campaign, though, is brilliant – particularly if you’re a fan of the source. Yes, the faces take time to get used to and I for one am not happy that Hawkeye has been pushed to the back of the bus at launch, but despite its flaws I’ve had a great time with Marvel’s Avengers – and I’m not done yet.An exciting campaign

Marvel's Avengers,Joshua Wise,VideoGamer,http://www.videogamer.com//reviews/marvels-avengers-review," Posted in Reviews
It’s only right that Marvel’s Avengers should begin with a celebration. The opening of the supergroup’s West Coast headquarters is in full swing, in San Francisco, and the frenzy, as thousands gather, praying for a glimpse of shield or hammer, is akin to the ribbon-cutting of a new shopping mall. Above this baying horde cruises Kamala Khan, an incessant young girl who dreams of one day being the kind of masked slugger capable of such effective franchising. She has been jetted in from Jersey City, as a finalist in a fan fiction competition, and she is told, after playing a Thor-themed arcade amusement, that, “Almost worthy is still pretty good.” It goes without saying that, when the stars swoop onto the stage, the parade is apocalyptically rained on. The question is: between our costume-wearing, worthy overlords and the tech-infused forces of protest—whose leader later argues that he “only wants to free us from being at the mercy of the powerful”—who do you root for?The answer, of course, for the Marvel-mad will be easy, and the occasion of the game’s release will be akin to its early minutes—a matter of fevered worship. Short of that, the first thing we might do is applaud the fact that Marvel’s Avengers exists, that it can be bought and booted up, and that there is fun here to be had. After finishing the single-player story and a slew of online multiplayer skirmishes, I felt just as I did in 2012, reeling from the cinema, having watched The Avengers, and wishing to congratulate the director, Joss Whedon, not merely for shepherding a functioning film to our screens but for shunting and scraping the gigantic moving parts of a machine into place—and not having it topple into tedium.So how has the developer, Crystal Dynamics, done it? First, there is the plot, which provides an army of robots, called Synthoids, ripe for conscience-free wrecking. The action resumes five years on from the fateful events of the opening, given the calendar-darkening designation of “A-Day,” which saw, in order of narrative importance, (a) the breakup of the Avengers, having been blamed for the disaster, (b) the leak of a superpower-spreading mist, and (c) the deaths of thousands. A shady organisation called Advanced Idea Mechanics, A.I.M. for short, has sprang up, promising a solution to the problem of the “Inhumans”—those suffering from being newly super. One such sufferer is, wouldn’t you know it, Ms. Khan, who, buoyed by her father Abu’s advice—“‘Good’ isn’t a thing you are. It’s a thing you do”—attempts to reunite the Avengers. Second, there is the structure: the campaign is parcelled out in a series of missions, granting you control of each hero, all of which entail travelling to a location and, abiding by Abu’s ethos, beating the shit out of whomever we find there.The beating is, by and large, decent enough. You have a light and heavy attack, three charge-up specials, and a dodge: hardly what you’d call advanced idea mechanics, but it provides both chew and crunch. Freshly junked Synthoids crumple into fiery parts, and your human foes are zipped into custard hazmat suits, heightening their resemblance to punching bags. It won’t fully satisfy, in terms of weight and whip, those who enjoyed Spider-Man or the Batman: Arkham games, but there are sufficient fireworks—whether launched from Iron Man’s palms or lashed down from the heavens by Thor’s hammer—to entertain.And part of the fun, indeed, is in switching things up. Kamala’s abilities are the sort you might contract after being bitten by a radioactive rubber band; she can elongate and expand, ballooning her fists into elastic wrecking balls and warping out of harm’s way. Captain America and Black Widow are more traditional brawlers, armed with long-range options; she with pistols, he with Frisbeeish shield. Iron Man possesses the properties of a bipedal Jump Jet, while Thor and Hulk opt for all-out wrath. The gulf of difference between characters can be leapt in a single, short bound, with no drastic divergences; they all must occupy the bet-hedging space of centre stage, as if ready, at any moment, to peel off and pilot their own solo projects.The test, for Marvel’s Avengers, was always going to be if it can match Ms. Khan for sheer stretchability, and keep the endgame going after the credits. Hence the gear, strewn throughout the levels, which you collect and cluster onto your chosen fighters, the better to buff their strength, speed, and, presumably, their aptitude for cooking, sewing, suit-washing, and other domestic duties. To my great shame, I lack the rapacious passion that might fuel the ongoing search for more; my enthusiasm went about as far as holding the “Equip Best Gear” button. By way of further longevity, Crystal Dynamics has served up a stream of multiplayer missions, and thus raised the question that hangs, like a cloud, over the A-Day of the game’s launch. Is there enough here—be it objectives, motivations, or variety—to spin out over an open-ended span, to wage an infinity war against the likes of, say, Destiny 2? I am doubtful, but that may prove foolish in the face of a rapt fanbase, and what game can’t be suffused with long-term joys, when you have friends, headsets, humour, and beer? When it comes to online multiplayer games, “good” isn’t only something they are; it’s something you do.What I can conclusively report is the sterile feel of Marvel’s Avengers. It’s a shame that the art direction, by Brenoch Adams and Josh Bapst, shuns the possibilities of not only the comics but of other Avengers-boasting titles, like Marvel vs. Capcom and Marvel: Ultimate Alliance. If you’re hoping for hues and muscles as bursting as bubblegum, you’re in for a dispiriting time. The characters here seem to have been plucked from an unlicensed browser game, sidling just close enough to the actors in the movies while ducking the watchful glare of any Hollywood patent attorneys. Take Hulk, for example. We get Bruce Banner, in rimless spectacles and plumb-coloured shirt, played, with shuffling timidity, by Troy Baker—the prevailing effect of which is that you end up really missing Mark Ruffalo. And, when he bulges free of his clothing, he isn’t even that green—more a bruised yellow-brown, like a seriously pissed-off banana. What gives? It made me miss the old Ang Lee design: the violent pop of those purple trunks, and the radioactive snot-green of his skin. It was worth putting up with the incredible sulk of Eric Bana just to get a peek.Meanwhile, Nolan North, as Tony Stark, clamps on the same armour of quips that Robert Downey Jr. wore to shield himself from seriousness; only, North’s is clearly the Mark I version, its humour core running at half-capacity. Laura Bailey does her level best with a bland Black Widow, while Jeff Schine and Travis Willingham, Captain America and Thor, respectively, can’t bottle the lightning of their big-screen counterparts. And Sandra Saad, who voices Kamala, is sidled with a character who constantly narrates every nervous second of her life. The other problem is that the plot, written by Shaun Escayg and John Stafford, frets over the fate of a world that it isn’t willing, or interested, to depict. No inch is given to the grime of surface living. We get snowstruck wastes, a parched, canyoned sweep of Utah, and the Pacific Northwest, which, with its tree-mounted metal platforms, looks more like Endor.When we are served up an urban sprawl—Manhattan, no less—we find it bare. Iron Man is told that “AIM has evacuated the city due to heavy Inhuman activity,” and he replies, “Sounds like an excuse to experiment on dangerous technology.” Sorry, Tony, it sounds like an excuse for a risk-free romp through streets as fabricated as the Synthoids that patrol them. The whole thing made me crave those moments, in Spider-Man, where you would catch the subway and sit in the sweaty fug of your fellow New Yorkers. Call it heavy human activity. The air of artificiality isn’t helped by the chirring of visual bugs and, on the base model PS4, severe framerate dips. Supposedly, the game is targeted for the Xbox One X and the PS4 Pro upwards, into the next generation—future-proofing at the expense of the present. These gripes, I expect, won’t bother those gripped by the prospect of continuous Avenging, who will frantically anticipate the raft of new heroes being piped in via DLC. Power to them. There may well be the feeling of a missed opportunity here, but no matter. Almost worthy is still pretty good.Developer: Crystal DynamicsPublisher: Square EnixAvailable on: PlayStation 4 [reviewed on], Xbox One, PC, StadiaRelease date: September 4, 2020To check what a review score means from us, click here.

Price: Free for owners of Marvel’s Avengers ($40)
Genre: Multiplayer action/adventureMarvel’s Avengers: War for Wakanda has the same charms as the base game — and the same problems. This free expansion to Marvel’s multiplayer action game adds Black Panther as a playable character, as well as a substantial story campaign and a handful of new multiplayer missions. The price is right, and Black Panther is a welcome addition to the roster. But War for Wakanda can’t do much to change the fact that Marvel’s Avengers can be a confusing, tedious experience that tries to cram single-player adventures into a game designed around a multiplayer core.While War for Wakanda is probably worthwhile for dedicated Avengers fans who are in the mood for some new content, it’s a tougher sell for more casual fans. Since the expansion is free, you have nothing to lose by checking it out. But if you haven’t touched Avengers since you completed the campaign last September, War for Wakanda will probably remind you why.If you haven’t played Marvel’s Avengers before, it’s an action/adventure game where you control a variety of Marvel superheroes, leveling up their skills and gear as you go. There’s a single-player component, where you guide the characters through an original story, and a multiplayer component, where you team up with other players to run more difficult missions for better equipment. Each character has a markedly different play style, with unique skills and items.For a more detailed breakdown of gameplay, you can check out our original Marvel’s Avengers impressions. The basic premise hasn’t changed in War for Wakanda, but the cast has. Rather than Ms. Marvel, our point-of-view character this time around is Black Panther, aka King T’Challa of Wakanda. When recurring bad guy organization Advanced Idea Mechanics (AIM) attempt to invade his technologically rich African nation, Black Panther teams up with the Avengers to oust the villains.The big highlight here is Black Panther himself, who represents the game’s ninth playable Avenger. (Previously, the roster comprised Captain America, Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Black Widow, Ms. Marvel, Hawkeye and Kate Bishop.) Unlike the last two downloadable characters (the Hawkeyes), Black Panther is a melee hero, focused on technical combos, precise parries and building up energy for devastating attacks.Black Panther’s central conceit is his “Intrinsic energy” bar, which allows him to store power as he successfully blocks attacks. As he levels up, he can channel this energy into powerful attacks, which may involve pouncing on foes, launching himself off of nearby walls or smashing through an enemy’s guard. Black Panther’s abilities feel true to the character, and help set him apart from any Avenger we’ve played as before.The trouble is that while Black Panther is a well-designed character, Marvel’s Avengers still just isn’t that much fun to play. The more technical skills are often not worth the effort when light and heavy attacks almost always suffice. Furthermore, no matter what you do, you’ll have to contend with needlessly large enemy health bars and swarms of foes that overstay their welcome by a considerable margin. After pummeling an unremarkable marksman or robot into submission for the hundredth time, I started to wonder what kept people coming back to Marvel’s Avengers, anyway.The answer must be “the multiplayer,” since it’s admittedly satisfying to pick the character who suits you best, hone your skills with friends and eventually get the best possible “version” of your Avenger, complete with your favorite classic costume.However, that’s not really what the single-player experience feels like, and War for Wakanda is primarily a single-player affair. (Although, to be fair, you can play through the whole story with up to three friends.) Just like the previous story campaigns, the levels in War for Wakanda feel like they were designed for multiplayer matches, even when it’s to their detriment.In most War for Wakanda levels, Black Panther and three other Avengers land in the middle of a lush jungle. They traverse a needlessly big, open-ended battlefield, occasionally stopping to fight enemies or pick up better gear — if they feel like it. The story objectives almost always boil down to “reach this waypoint” or “solve this embarrassingly simple puzzle.” The repetitious rainforests, cliffsides and ancient temples don’t add much of a tactical challenge, save that you’ll occasionally have to do a bit of imprecise platforming.Occasionally, though, you’ll have to put up with a truly hellacious set piece: a battle against one of AIM’s gargantuan FUSE drills. To call these encounters “excruciating” is somehow an understatement. While fighting off hordes of enemies (most of whom have ranged weapons, and can fling you across the battlefield like a noisome insect), you’ll have to target the drill’s weak points, some of which can shoot fire or lasers at you. You’ll then have to jump up a series of floating platforms, which usually ends with an enemy flinging you to the ground, where you’ll have to start the tiresome process all over again. If you employ AI companions, they usually don’t follow your lead; if you fail, you have to start the whole FUSE section over again.The real kicker, however, is that the game requires you to do this twice.The “story” part of the story campaign is also a bit of a letdown. Perennial B-list Marvel villains Ulysses Klaw and Crossbones lead a team of mercenaries into Wakanda and attempt to plunder the company’s Vibranium stores. Black Panther and his royal court, as well as the Avengers, fight back. That’s about it.If you pitched the most generic version of a recognizable Black Panther arc, it would sound something like War for Wakanda. The story has no twists or turns to speak of, and doesn’t do much to advance the ongoing AIM arc that’s carried Marvel’s Avengers so far.I do have to give the game props for its characterization of Black Panther, however. While the recent movie sanded off some of T’Challa’s rough edges, the game remembers that he has a dark side. At his best, Black Panther is noble and proud; at his worst, he’s suspicious and arrogant. War for Wakanda portrays both sides of the character, although it doesn’t have enough depth to really explore either one.War for Wakanda looks very good, at least on the PS5. The country of Wakanda, and the capital city of Birnin Zana in particular, positively pop with Afrofuturist details. Wakanda is a colorful place, from its azure skies and verdant rainforests, to the reddish browns of its ancient tramways. You can also collect plenty of cool Black Panther costumes and profile images.The music and sound effects get the job done, but I had mixed feelings about Black Panther’s voice. Christopher Judge is a fantastic actor in shows like Stargate SG-1 and games like God of War (2018), but as T’Challa, his accent is inconsistent, and his performance can be expository. Admittedly, this might also be an issue with the underwhelming script.Marvel’s Avengers: War for Wakanda is neither better nor worse than the main game. It’s still a cool showcase for some beloved Marvel characters. It also still can’t quite decide whether it’s a single-player game with optional multiplayer missions, or a multiplayer game with a single-player onboarding section.While the protagonist and setting both work to War for Wakanda’s advantage, neither one improves the overall Avengers experience that much. Then again, the expansion doesn’t cost anything extra, so you’ve got nothing to lose but your afternoon.Marshall Honorof is a senior editor for Tom's Guide, overseeing the site's coverage of gaming hardware and software.

Marvel's Avengers,David Flynn,GamingTrend,https://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/new-place-same-issues-marvels-avengers-war-for-wakanda-review/,"The country of Wakanda has sealed its borders for many years. The current ruler and Black Panther, king T’Challa, protects his people from those who want to steal their technology or Vibranium. However, when an AIM faction led by Ulysses Klaue attacks they’re forced to team up with the Avengers to stop this invasion. War for Wakanda is Marvel’s Avengers biggest update yet, with new drop zones and a brand new character in the form of Black Panther. We’ve already gone over the basics in our preview, so let’s get down to brass tacks. T’Challa is a ton of fun to play with his ability to pounce and unleash devastating aerial combos. Even still, I found myself becoming disinterested in the combat which is an issue Avengers has continued to struggle with.Despite Black Panther’s fun moveset and adding something unique to the roster, combat still lacks any impact. The sound design is pitch perfect, the animations look great and hard hitting, so why do my eyes glaze over when playing this game? I think it may have to do with how your character and enemies react to attacks. Foes are either easy to stun lock or just continue to do their thing, and dodging their fire or even getting hit only leads to a moment of down time before you’re back to mashing square. Despite having vastly different abilities, all the characters’ playstyles boil down to mashing one button over and over. It leaves the game feeling stuck between the simplistic elegance of a brawler and the depth of a character action game.The developers are continuing to make improvements to the game. It certainly feels better than the last time I covered it and the clunky menus have seen a fantastic overhaul, but they’ve still got a ways to go until the game continues to hold my attention for longer than it takes to finish the single player. It’s a shame, because the new content here is by far the best the game has seen since launch. Traveling through the new areas in Wakanda often involves puzzle or platforming sections which are a lot of fun and mix things up to keep these longer missions interesting. In fact, the platforming bits with Black Panther double jumping and running on walls makes me desperately want a solo game focusing on his cat-like abilities. The single player story presented here will take you to some neat locations, including a beautiful Wakandan hub to buy gear, cosmetics, and set off on new adventures from. It does end up feeling a little bland, however, because it’s clear that Klaue poses no threat to T’Challa until the final boss fight; it’s only his hostages and force fields that prevent the king from kicking his butt. I do like how much focus is placed on our new hero, which allows the Avengers to serve more of a support role. Still, it’s an enjoyable introduction to Wakanda and a big step in the right direction for Marvel’s Avengers. Marvel’s Avengers: War for Wakanda introduces fantastically designed new areas with a dash of puzzles and platforming to mix things up. While the combat still has a long way to go before it remains interesting, this expansion is worth checking out for Black Panther’s skills.—David FlynnSee below for our list of partners and affiliates:One of the longest running independent gaming news, reviews and culture sites on the web.The thing that is magical about the Wizarding World isn’t the magic – it’s...by Ron BurkeThe world is going to end.

Marvel's Avengers,Ron Burke,GamingTrend,https://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/great-campaign-so-so-multiplayer-imperfectly-balanced-marvels-avengers-review/,"With 81 years of content ready and waiting to be explored, it’s a real wonder that we’ve not gotten a 4-player adventure game in the Marvel Cinematic Universe before now. THQ tried and failed, and the Avengers movies came and went without so much as a peep. Now, Square Enix is stepping up to the plate with Marvel’s Avengers, a game focused on 4-player cooperative play with years of planned updates and free roster expansions. Where does this game fit into the Marvel universe, where does it stand at launch, and what can we expect in the future? There are a lot of questions to answer, so let’s get started.The first question that is likely top of everyone’s mind is what kind of game is Marvel’s Avengers. Well, that answer is a little more complicated than I expected at the outset. First and foremost, Marvel’s Avengers sports a fantastic all-new single-player campaign told from the perspective of Kamala Khan. Khan, who will ultimately become Ms. Marvel, starts the game as a very young girl obsessed with the Avengers. She’s written a fanfic story that got her an invite to A-Day — a celebration of the Avengers and everything they stand for aboard one of S.H.I.E.L.D.’s helicarriers. While attending this event, a brutal attack hits the heart of San Francisco, causing massive death and destruction, and the Avengers can do nothing to stop it. Now, five years after the events of A-Day, Khan stumbles onto a plot that will need the combined powers of the Avengers once again — if she can find and reunite them.The campaign will take a dozen or so hours on normal difficulty (there are four levels to choose from) and is easily the best part of what Marvel’s Avengers has to offer. By wrapping the storyline around Kamala Khan’s perspective, the game picks up a slick growth arch. She has to lean into her newfound powers as she reassembles the Avengers to take down AIM. Due to her fanfic background, she knows enough about the Avengers to roll with the punches but still feels like a new recruit that has to earn her stripes. Kamala is an absolute fangirl for the Avengers team, but you know what they say — never meet your heroes.This game is, at its core, a looter-beat-em-up.Without power diving deep into spoiler territory, the plot is essentially a new take on the Inhumans comic arc. The Avengers are seemingly responsible for a disastrous event that causes humans on the west coast to develop powers. As these powers can range from awesome to awful, humanity immediately turns on the team, driving them into exile for five years. As Advanced Idea Mechanics, or AIM, steps in to help track down and “help” these new “Inhumans,” one has to wonder, what’s in it for them?One of my favorite parts of the campaign is that the team at Square Enix settled on foes that haven’t been repeatedly retread countless times. If you’ve managed to stay in the dark, you’ll be surprised. If not, you’ll be happy to know that the team has handled the main villain with a great deal of care so as to not allow the story to drift too far to the ridiculous. Kamala’s irreverent and grounded humor is fantastic, and the writing really shines through. A great example is Kamala and Bruce having to take an impromptu road trip which sets up a fun culture clash sequence over song choices and Slurpee sounds.The problem with the campaign is that, despite this game being designed for multiple people, you can only tackle a handful of missions together. Put simply, once you’ve unlocked a second character, everything afterwards should be able to be run with at least one friend. Unfortunately, that’s not the way the campaign is designed. You’ll have to play the missions in the campaign solo, except for the occasional mission at the war table listed as “multiplayer”. Undoubtedly this is done to control the narrative, but nobody is out there saying “I wish I could run every other mission in Halo in co-op.”There are some other occasional oddities in the critical path on the campaign. One example might be that you’ll play three to four hours of story-driven missions, ending up at a central hub where you can tackle virtual reality training. These start off by teaching you how to play as the Hulk — something you’ve done in several extended missions prior to this. Similarly, there are things that I wish were better explained. What is valor, reliance, intensity, particle damage, and why do I need any of it? Sure, Pym particles shrink enemies, but does that mean I do more damage to them, or that they do less damage? I’m sure some min/maxer out there can explain it in infinite detail, but this is something I’d expect to learn from the game, not from a FAQ.It seems like the bigger games get, the more, (the more, the more, the more) repetition, (repetition) we hear, (hear, hear). It doesn’t take long before you’ve heard every flavor voiceover from every hero at least a dozen dozen times. This is less problematic in the scripted single player game, but when you embark on any off-path mission you’ll find yourself groaning at Jarvis and Tony most of all.The combat in the Avengers is easy to pick up, and a challenge to master. Attacks are split between light and heavy, with modifiers if you hold a button longer or simply tap it. Combinations can be unleashed with sequenced button presses, and a well-timed dodge or block can mean the difference between a tough fight and masterful control over your chosen Avenger. Adding powers to the mix lets you play your character your way. It’s simple enough for a more casual player, but deep enough to transcend mere button mashing.Power progression is a tricky thing in a game like Marvel’s Avengers. If Hulk can SMASH, how do you make him smash less? The leveling system and three tabs of powers is how. At level 1, your character can do most of the defining things you’d expect. For example, Iron Man can fly, shoot repulsors, and beat down enemies at close range, and Hulk leaps across the battlefield at increasingly further distances, able to unleash his rage for additional damage. Tucked away behind the leveling system lies the rest of the powers that help Tony go from rookie suit pilot to high-powered combat flight jock, or lets Hulk smash even harder. Using Tony as the example, you can pick between focusing on your repulsors, lasers, or rockets, or you can work on your three “Hero Powers” (think Ultimates), defensive capabilities like a projectile shield, or adding a dive attack to his arsenal. It’s very likely you’ll have only a few of these skills unlocked by the time you close the books on the campaign, leading directly to the multiplayer.All microtransactions are cosmetic.First and foremost, if you are worried about the microtransaction portion of Marvel’s Avengers, don’t be. While it is a “games as a service” title, Avengers only has cosmetic offerings. The “Units” (seriously, that’s the best name we could come up with?) you collect can be used for new skins, nameplates, and different finishing moves. There are no pay-to-win elements anywhere in the game, though you can pay to skip forward in faction vendor loyalty level to buy new cosmetics. Even still, as the game is not competitive in any way, there’s little point to this beyond the looks you can bring to the field. At present, you can get a new character skin for 7000, nameplates for 500, and emotes for 1250. Amazingly, playing the game for 30 hours I barely collected just above half of what I needed to get a single new skin, so the grind is steep. Cosmetics rotate every week, just like they do in other GaaS titles. It is baffling, however, that you can’t preview any of them before you buy them from the vendor (though you can in the cosmetics menu, which makes this more strange) — this feels like an oversight.Sharing much in common with games like Destiny 2 or Diablo 3, there is a wealth of loot to grind through in Marvel’s Avengers. Your character has four equipment slots, and three artifact slots to occupy. Each of these equipment types carries different faction alignment possibilities, including Pym, Shield, Stark, and others. These can provide bonuses like having a critical light attack finisher trigger a short-term defense buff, or reviving a fellow hero granting a boon to all other heroes. Like Destiny, you’ll have to grind out faction assignments to level up your faction vendor access.With a game built around loot collection, that loot has to be interesting. Like other looter-shooter style games, these come in vendor trash all the way up to legendary classifications. Normally, this means you feel a sense of progression, with your first legendary being a momentous occasion, and every one after that being equally as exciting as they are indeed rare. Here, I had a full array of legendaries which were replaced quickly by rares, and then replaced again by epic. The “rarity” of loot is broken as gear seems to be sprinkled about with little regard to whether it’s exciting or not. Normally grey has no perks, green has one perk, epic has two, and legendary has three, but in Avengers you’ll find almost any gear with anywhere from zero to three perks, regardless of rarity. While you can deconstruct equipment and manage your loadout mid-mission, when the gear never stops dropping, it starts to lose its value, devolving into a numbers-chasing game rather than meaningful equipment for your Avenger.The world of Marvel’s Avengers is seemingly built programmatically with a tile system. The game appears to take level components from several different pools, combining them to create a level set. The problem is that, after about 6 hours, you’ll have seen every tile. You’ll begin to recognize the same hallways, caves, factories, and laboratories, as well as the mechanics that are tied to them. By way of example, there’s one part of the factory where you’ll break four reactor nodes stuck to the four corner sections of the area. The enemies and their powers may change, but the objective is almost always the same.Square Enix has promised exclusive War Table events that’ll be available for a limited time. I’ve not seen any pop up as of yet, but they are also promising major updates every month. The first major update has been announced as adding Kate Bishop and Clint Barton, aka two flavors of Hawkeye. Recent leaks suggest far more adds to the roster, including fan-favorites like Black Panther, but we’ll have to wait and see.There are a wealth of skills to unlock and deploy.There are secret vaults hidden randomly throughout your missions (and by hidden, I mean you’ll immediately know where they are by just tracking down the GPS signal) that have a challenge before they give up their precious loot. Fighting through some tougher foes, as well as a puzzle solving detour, you’ll gain access to a bunch of materials you can use to upgrade your equipment, as well as a few crates. The rarity problem still exists, as does the tile and puzzle repetition, making these vaults less rewarding than they should be.I want to take a moment and really recognize the art team behind Marvel’s Avengers. After the initial reveal they doubled down and worked hard to make this game absolutely gorgeous. Every aspect of the game is lovingly crafted fan service. Sure, the characters aren’t the actors who’ve played them for the last two decades of movies, but that’s an unreasonable ask. Instead we get some of the most iconic voice actors bringing them to life. The facial animations are top shelf, and the whole thing looks beautiful. Watching the interminably long credits shows that there are about as many companies and artists that worked on this game as worked on Avengers Endgame, so it’s no surprise that it delivers the goods on visual quality.The original release date of Marvel’s Avengers was May 15, 2020. Here we are four months later, and despite the delay, there are entirely too many bugs in the current build of the game. I’ve run into a bug where the cursor stops being responsive, I’ve had the start button stop working, attack buttons cease to function until I died, if you look at one set of comics there’s a chance you won’t be able to view the rest, my wife and I have fallen through the world a few times, and stun effects make the screen blurry and then it sticks that way. I’ve been bounced out of more missions with my friends than I can count (and you cannot rejoin once booted — the game is not drop-in, drop-out), I’ve also had the game crash and tell me I don’t have enough resources whilst running a 2080 Super — I kinda doubt that’s accurate. The list goes on — audio voiceover drops out on occasion, reminders to visit faction vendors you can’t reach, “hold X to open” stuck on the screen, dailies aren’t resetting, multiple crashes to desktop, half a dozen full system locks, people’s hair disappears and reappearing, and several missions where my wife ended up with two Hulks on her team. During the final two missions of the campaign we crashed to desktop a staggering seven times. There are also plenty of the usual jittery havok bugs, and none of this list even begins to address the framerate problem.Running bleeding edge hardware — a 2080 Super and a 2080 Ti, an 10th Gen Intel processor, and 32GB of RAM, this game will chug into the mid-teens without rhyme or reason. It doesn’t happen in the same place every time, it has nothing to do with the amount of polygons on the screen, and it always seems to happen at the worst possible moment. During the final two levels of the campaign, we clocked the framerate in the single digits an innumerable amount of times. Even in the day and age of ship now, patch later, this is simply unacceptable.There are a few hiccups around balance that rear its head to spoil the fun. At present, you’ll occasionally run into issues where you can be one or two-shotted by enemies that are at the same power level as your character, or lower. I’m not sure if it’s a bug (it seems entirely possible given the list above), but occasionally you’ll have non-elite enemies seemingly able to outpace the damage output of their elite counterparts. It can make for some frustrating engagements and frequent retries, even on Easy difficulty level. Moreover, you’ll then step into the next room to face a boss and they’ll be such a pushover that you’ll have to scratch your head.I’m somewhat belaboring the point, but there are some design faults that cause heartache. At present, Black Widow and Iron Man have no way to destroy cracked doors with chests behind them, though everyone else can. Worse, when you do throw the beatdown onto a boss and you are blessed with a legendary loot drop, you can kiss it goodbye — loot on the floor when a mission ends, stays there. Seeing a legendary on the ground to be left behind as Jarvis pats you on the back for a job well done feels like faint praise indeed. Adding 30 seconds to the mission to let me collect my rewards, or simply throwing it in the overflow vault would have solved this problem.We do need to take a beat and talk about the AI, as the Avengers are not all built the same. Hulk is an absolute beast on the battlefield, as you’d expect, but he’s also my most steadfast ally for revives when controlled by the AI. Tony Stark on the other hand will happily let you bleed out, and Kamala is only marginally better. That said, I’ve also seen every single one of them, and occasionally enemies, fall into a deep trance where they stand still and contemplate the secrets of the universe, absorbing damage with a stupid grin on their face. Most of the time they’ll kick back to reality and go about their business, but sometimes they’ll just stand there and watch you die. It’s the circle of AI life, I suppose.Here’s the worst thing with ALL of the items above — they should have been (and probably were) caught in testing. Unfortunately, the beta was used more as a marketing tool to drum preorders than it was to get valuable feedback. 8.5 million people played the open beta, but there’s no way the team could have digested, much less acted on, all of that data. Literally every single one of the items above could have been addressed by having Marvel’s Avengers come out at the end of September rather than the beginning.The trick with reviewing titles with Games as a Service components is that we are essentially playing a prologue. These games are rarely feature rich, balanced, or content complete on launch. Some do a fantastic job of evolving over time, building out massive worlds full of lore, loot, and adventure. Unfortunately, for every Sea of Thieves, Diablo 3, or No Man’s Sky, you also end up with Anthem, Fallout 76, or the original Destiny. Lack of content updates, predatory loot boxes, and punitive grinding can turn off players quickly. Thankfully, the cosmetics-only approach for Avengers prevents the loot box problem, but repetitive battles, objectives, and mechanics are still an issue. Unfortunately for Marvel’s Avengers, the experience of Anthem (mine included as I rated that title based on its potential instead of what was in the box — a mistake) has made all of us leery. As a result, it’s difficult to assign the game any level of numeric score as it could be very, very different in two months’ time.Once you’ve completed the campaign (the game discourages you from jumping into multiplayer without having ticked that box, and I concur) you’ll be able to embark on two dozen or so missions to get you started. The best of these are the iconic missions as they are story-based outings for each of the characters to further their adventures. Sure, they re-se some set pieces, thus suffering from the same repetition we see in the campaign structure, but the added storyline and voice work will pull you in. In addition, there are a number of side missions to boost your gear and power level. The current cap is 150, though there is little reason to grind that out at this point other than wanting to hit higher difficulty levels.There are a lot of mechanics that allow you to stretch your multiplayer missions that much further. There is a fabrication machine that lets you craft cosmetics you find in the world. Vault mission can drop DNA keys that can give you additional goodies — if you can find them. Some missions will have exceedingly high power levels, so you’ll have to run and re-run missions at higher difficulty levels to tackle those. At this point, Square Enix is promising major updates every month, so you can also just wait for new content and enjoy the natural progression at that point — that’s my plan, anyway.Easily the most frustrating part of Marvel’s Avengers is that there is an incredibly fun game in here. Four people teaming up as the world’s greatest heroes is an absolute blast — when it works correctly. Fighting AIM with your friends is more fun than I expected, and the framework for something amazing and infinitely expandable is here — it’s just currently buried under a pile of bugs.With a great campaign, and engaging (albeit repetitive) multiplayer, Marvel’s Avengers is a fun title with cosmetic-only games as a service components bolted onto it. The innumerable bugs hide what could be an amazing and ever-expanding universe -- I just hope the team at SquareEnix is up to the challenge.

Marvel's Avengers,Tom Hoggins,Telegraph,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/features/marvels-avengers-review-hope-ailing-superhero-game/,"
			Avengers 'service' game is struggling for players, but punchy combat and a strong campaign give it a fighting chance of revival
		Far from being the slamdunk it should have been, Crystal Dynamics punchy take on Marvel's Avengers -that ubiquitous band of superheroes- has travelled a more troubled path. Much of its apparently grind-tastic approach to video games --basing its loot-based multiplayer on the likes of Destiny-- left the watching world cold in the run-up to release. A curiously soulless and overwhelmingly corporate cash-grab was the impression. Something not assuaged by a fairly clumsy beta. And now, just a month after release, it finds itself struggling to keep its players invested.After a period of reflection, it's clear this Avengers game -while not free of feature creep and significant structural issues- is more finely crafted and comes with a good deal more heart than its early showings let on. Tellingly, most of this comes through in its initially unheralded single-player campaign. A flashy if short-lived narrative that makes the bold choice of putting Kamala Khan -aka Ms Marvel- at the centre.As an Avengers superfan, Khan finds herself at A-Day, a celebration of the merry band that goes terribly wrong after a supervillain attack. By teatime, Captain America is presumed dead, the other Avengers are vilified and scattered to the wind, while scores of citizens are marked as 'inhumans' after they develop superpowers of their own. Kamala is one of them, able to stretch and reshape her limbs to grapple across city rooftops or give bad guys a good bashing with a giant fist.Five years later, amid a totalitarian takeover of the US by robotics company AIM -which has requisitioned all of Tony Stark's fanciest toys- Kamala has made it her mission to track down the Avengers and set things right. She is a thoroughly engaging lead, both resolute and wide-eyed at seeking out and meeting her heroes. Her own excitement upon meeting The Incredible Hulk and co translates to the player, who in turn gets a new superhero to bash AIM's robots in with. Kamala is a teenager riven with self-doubt and a certain degree of naivete, making her the perfect foil for the downtrodden and bickering Avengers. The game has genuinely smart flashes in its narrative as Kamala helps piece the broken team together against the backdrop of a dystopian America brainwashed by AIM propaganda.As you hop around the globe, taking part in different missions and able to switch between heroes (almost) at will  the game revolves around its combat. It's a well-executed brawler, with a real sense of connection and definable differences between each character. Ms Marvel has speed and range as her limbs fly. You feel Hulk's thunderous movement and swinging cannonball fists as they connect (and picking up fodder and swinging them around never gets old). As Iron Man you can hover around the battlefield firing off missiles or sweeping into a thruster-propelled dive. Black Widow's mix of martial arts, dual pistols and grappling hooks are impressively versatile. Thor's hammer Mjolnir connects with shuddering force.In this sense, Avengers provides what many of its fans might be looking for. And, at times, when the narrative hits its notable peaks Avengers turns into the kind of thrill-ride its cinematic cousins are famous for. But (anyou knew there was a 'but' coming) the problem is that this feeling is too fleeting. And often pushed aside by the things that Avengers doesn't get right.Its campaign succeeds despite of some of the mechanics of a 'service-game' creeping in rather than because of them. It left me longing for an Avengers game more dedicated to its campaign --made with obvious flair from the studio that successfully rebooted Tomb Raider-- than the long-term multiplayer that follows.The idea is, presumably, to lock you into its cycle to keep you playing the game's apparent raison d'etre -the Avengers Initiative- after the campaign credits have rolled. It isn't long before you are bombarded with different item vendors, a bewildering array of buffs and items to equip and a never-ending volley of daily quests to smash X amount of robots in Y amount of time.There is nothing inherently wrong with this approach, of course. And despite the early negativity, you can see how a long-running co-operative game can fit the Avengers ethos. Each player taking their pick of a tooled up superhero to missions around the globe in a constant battle against emerging villainous threats. That part works. But less so the  elements transposed from games like Destiny and The Division.Each hero finds different tech that can upgrade things like melee and ranged abilities, like finding a new weapon to equip with different buffs. But because the Avengers move-set is carefully curated and set, any change to Iron Man's arc reactor or Hulk's spinal implants makes no tangible difference beyond making health points fly out of bad guys at slightly higher numbers.It is a fundamental misplacement of what makes loot games work. Finding a new powerful weapon in Destiny brings a frisson of excitement because it can have an entirely different look and feel. You begin to develop favourites that you cannot bear to part with, even when the shinier toys with higher stats arrive. There is none of that here, with cosmetic suit changes handled as separate unlocks of full outfits.(Some of these are brilliant, by the way, with Crystal Dynamics artists clearly having a lot of fun. But it would have been nice for costumes to develop more naturally through play than they do.)It makes the multiplayer endgame feel a little hollow. Hopping between missions and smashing robots up before moving onto the next one and repeating. Having had a blast with the campaign, the Avengers Initiative was a familiar grind that I quickly lost interest in. And one that many others have too, with a recent report claiming that concurrent players on the PC version has already dipped below 1000. Which is, in no uncertain terms, a disaster.For Avengers to entertain any thought of survival as a service game, then, there is a huge amount of work to be done. Most games in the area falter in their early days, if not necessarily to this extent, and there is the kernel of something good here, with strong combat and definable superheroes that are fun to stomp/fly/bound around with. With new heroes on the way to bolster out the roster, if Crystal Dynamics can find a way to hone the game closer to its strengths than its borrowed weaknesses, there may be hope for the Avengers yet. Otherwise the decision to compromise its otherwise solid campaign in the pursuit of all-consuming longevity could prove fatal."
Marvel's Avengers,Lou Sytsma,COGconnected,https://cogconnected.com/review/marvels-avengers-dlc-review/,"Marvel’s Avengers launched last September and the reaction was, being generous here, mixed. At launch the game was lacking in certain features such as multiplayer and was plagued with technical issues. Six months later most of the technical issues, though the previous console gen is still having problems, have been addressed but it maybe too little, too late. The window of acceptance may have passed this game by.It hasn’t helped that promised content has arrived late or not at all because technical fixes had to be done first. So promised DLC like Spiderman, on the PlayStation, and Black Panther have to yet appear. What has been delivered since last September is a technical patch, which includes PS5 upgrades, as well as DLC for Avengers Kate Bishop and Hawkeye. So the Avengers team rounds out to date with Captain America, Ironman, Thor, Black Widow, Hulk, Ms. Marvel, Kate Bishop and Hawkeye.In the original game release, the single player campaign told the origin story of Ms. Marvel aka Kamala Khan. The story is the strong point of the game. Probably because it has so much comic lore to draw from. The single player mode is the best way to play because the AI in this game is bad. Not just the enemies but more importantly, your allies. The game is set up around creating a team of four members. But quite often, your mates hover in the air, contributing little to fights and berating you for not doing better. You can get through the missions just as well playing solo.Of the two Season 1 DLCs the Kate Bishop one is the better of the two. Her story is more engaging. You get to play out her origin journey and how she meets and becomes part of the Avengers as a means to find Hawkeye. It is also slightly longer than Hawkeye’s story. Kate’s story takes about two and half hours whereas Hawkeye’s is only two hours.The Hawkeye DLC is underwhelming compared to Kate’s on several fronts. He has very little interaction with the Avengers and his power suite is pretty much the same as Kate’s. Both have bow and arrows for ranged attacks and swords for melee. The problem for Hawkeye is Kate was released first and she’s quicker and more nimble. Playing Hawkeye is just a less enjoyable tank. Finally, from a storytelling perspective, the Hawkeye DLC has no true ending. It’s just part one of a story that you have no idea of how and when it will be continued. Perhaps it’ll be in the Black Panther DLC but given Hawkeye’s prominence in the story, think Flash in Flashpoint, that doesn’t seem likely.While the roster has been expanded, the core gameplay remains unaltered and the DLCs are merely add-ons rather than bringing new things to do. Neither introduce any new enemies. It’s more AIM robots and the same missions: clear out AIM bases and/or shutdown AIM servers coupled with uninspired level designs as most of Hawkeye’s DLC takes place in the Wasteland. As the name suggests you’ll find yourself traversing boring stretches of sand in which cookie cutter enemy bases are sprinkled about. The gameplay already felt repetitive in the first campaign and the DLCs just deepen that rut.Multiplayer works now but you may have trouble finding companions to play with. That’s not a good sign for longevity. As usual, your experience depends on how well your live companions work as a unit. It should be noted that multiplayer is cross platform-enabled so if you hook up with a PS4 player steel yourself for return to long load times via elevator scenes.On the positive side a March patch addressed many of the technical issues. The PS5 upgrade offers the benefits in graphics and load times. The data transfer speeds of the PS5 continue to shine with their SSD turbocharged glory. The initial load of the main menu comes in at a nifty four seconds with the PS5 versus for the 24 for the PS4. The express load times really show their speedy goodness when you have chosen a mission. You’ll barely have time to blink as another mere four seconds pass by and you’re into the action. With the PS4 you’ll be tempted to take up knitting as it takes over an agonizingly long minute to accomplish the same thing.Two graphic modes are available to choose from: the Highest Performance 60 FPS mode and the 30 FPS/4K Quality Mode. Resolution in both modes is handled dynamically with the performance version using the checkerboard solution. Both modes target 4K with the Quality Mode hitting the 4K target more often than not. The performance mode scales a lot more ranging down to 1440p, especially during big action scenes.Both of these solutions use higher quality textures which lends to a much cleaner and sharper image compared to the PS4. This higher quality is noticeable in the liberally applied particle effects during battles. Weapons, character powers, and explosions all look great and there is less screen shimmer when moving around. The Performance Mode takes some quality cuts when handling shadows and water. This is also true for Depth of Field and Motion Blur. All of these look much better with the Quality Mode. In addition, the Quality Mode has enhanced environment destruction effects.Most importantly both modes do a superior job of meeting their respective frame range targets. The Quality Mode is a near locked 30 FPS while the Highest Performance fluctuates a little more usually when switching from in-game graphics to cinematics. The only time you’ll see in-game dips is when you Hulk Smash everything in sight. In terms of fluidity the performance mode wins handily as input response is just so much quicker and smoother at 60FPS. As usual it’s the preferred way to play.While playing the game, there was one thing that stood out to me that points out to a fundamental design flaw, however. As a service, game balance is a tantamount priority. Every game character must feel balanced against the others. This works fine in a new property like Destiny but not for such a well known entity like the Marvel Universe. It just plain feels weird that in a given battle situation the Hulk and Hawkeye possess the same offensive and defensive power levels. There’s no way the Hulk should be staggered by an attack from a single enemy redshirt as if he were a puny human. Yet that’s the path Crystal Dynamics has chosen to follow. It’s a concession you may be able to accept but it doesn’t work for me. I would have much rather seen game missions tailored to take into account Marvel character attributes.On a PS5 the game looks great, plays well, and loads up quickly. However, none of that can overcome the uninspired level design and lack of enemy variety. So despite the technical improvements, the game has not become more fun to play. The two DLCs add characters whose power sets are too similar. The main saving grace here is that the campaign stories are interesting enough to warrant a playthrough in solo mode. Unless there is some major gameplay tweaking Marvel Avengers doesn’t look like it will assemble to become an ongoing gaming service. To sum it up, I came for the gameplay but only stayed because of the story.*** PS5 code provided by the publisher ***Developer: Crystal Dynamics, Edios MontrealPublisher: Square Enix"
Marvel's Avengers,Sammy Barker,Push Square,http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/marvels_avengers,"GuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpThor-t it would be betterVersion Reviewed: EuropeanRepublished on Wednesday, 13th July, 2022: We're bringing this review back from the archives following the announcement of July's PS Plus Extra, Premium lineup. The original text follows.Marvel’s Avengers’ biggest mistake is that it wants to be a game you can play forever, without offering the variety to sustain such ambitions. Its cast of characters – spanning household names like Captain America and Iron Man – all have entertaining combat suites, but once you’ve reassembled Earth’s ultimate God Squad across the ten or so hour campaign, you’ll be left repeating the same activities over and over with no obvious, ahem, endgame.The title has improved immensely since its original PlayStation 4 launch, adding two new characters and mission branches, as well as a 60 frames-per-second option on PS5 which transforms the flow of the gameplay – but it still relies far too heavily on uninteresting objectives, which see you protecting designated strongholds while fighting off samey foes. All of this is in pursuit of strength-enhancing gear, which doesn’t even change your appearance.Played in co-op with friends or strangers the action is undeniably intense, although it can look grainy on Sony’s next-gen console. There’s excellent support for the DualSense controller, with the triggers rattling and shaking under your fingertips as you execute larger-than-life attacks. And the story, which revolves around the elasticated Kamala Khan, has its fair share of tender moments – but the package as a whole simply doesn’t have the density it needs to realise its potential.There will be case studies written about this release in the years to come, because it should have been a sure-fire slam dunk, and yet it feels like a missed opportunity. Make no mistake, the title has got better – and with the announcement of Black Panther, developer Crystal Dynamics remains committed to iterating on it for the foreseeable future – but as we alluded to in our Marvel’s Avengers PS4 review, there’s a disconnect between the promise of this product and what it actually offers right now.Not Bad 6/10Scoring PolicyPlease note that some external links on this page are affiliate links, which means if you click them and make a purchase we may receive a small percentage of the sale.

I would have put in a lot more hours if it was a linear experience like to Tomb Raider.Its a good game..just not great..its a shame really as no matter how many improvements are made its always going to get the rough end of the stick..The reviewers' constant emphasis on the extra missions is simply annoying. Yes, they are most certainly boring and they lack variety. I somehow still enjoy them because the action is incredibly satisfying, but I can see why most people don't like them.By constantly talking about the endgame, you ignore the excellent campaign and the decent free DLC. If anyone is on the fence, if you have the chance to play the game, stick to the campaign and forget about everything else. You will most likely greatly enjoy the game. So get it when it's cheap and worth the campaign alone?it reminds me of one of the Tekken games being criticized for an extra story mode it had, which didn't play well, but the core games was still superb. Why focus on that when you can simply ignore it?I still think it's stupid for SE to make this multiplayer loot-based game rather than full single player games like spider-man and jedi fallen order. Which sells very well btw 😕I finished the story on ps4, may go back and try it on PS5 but the grind is keeping me away. Especially now theyve altered some of the level progression. Will say its not a bad game by any means and would say to pick it up when its cheap like i did (£21). Honestly its the voice acting that erks me the most. Not that they are bad voice actors its just the same voice actors you hear in every game. I dont mind Nolan North or Travis Willingham so much but Troy Baker need to learn he can play background roles once in a while. As for Laura Bailey, kinda sick of her. There are many talented female VOs out there, basically same issue as troy.Anyways rant over, would also give this game 6/10@naruball ""Why focus on that when you can simply ignore it?""That defeats the entire point of analyzing any piece of art, and, in the case of Avengers, those repetitive missions are the bulk of what Square and Crystal want you to do when you're done with the story. The story mode isn't how SE wants to make back their money. It's these grindy endgame things that are the meat and potatoes of Avengers. They are why the devs proudly proclaimed this as a live service back at E3 2019. And, as many have pointed out, the endgame being crap is a big reason why this game bit Square in the ass financially. You can't ignore something like that. Why would Sammy and other reviewers ignore what defines this particular game?@naruball Because the game is designed around it. Even the campaign — which I agree is enjoyable — has several missions that are designed around its multiplayer, endgame content. You can't tell me that, structurally, you think the campaign would be the same if they'd originally designed a Tomb Raider-style Avengers rather than what we got.I like the game, too — a 6/10 is a good score! — and I agree that it's been improved since launch, but there's still flaws in it, and a lot of them stem from what they were actually trying to do. Which is to make a ""service-style"" game.I would consider getting this just for the campaign, but I'm already sick of Khamala from the initial demo and the game seems to largely focus on her.The game is a next gen Ultimate Alliance and it really should be played that way. It is about teaming up to fight some bad guys and having fun with the combat. A lot of people and journalists speak ill of the missions in the multiplayer, and I really don't get it. At that point, people are asking way too much from Marvel Avengers. The little missions you are given just serve to tell you where to go and augment the combat, and that's all it needs. If it had more complex objectives then the game would really be overloaded like everybody thinks it is now. Every game doesn't need everything and it cant have anything.The question and the review basis should come from is it fun, and how much work was put into it. If you don't want a game that is fun because of combat and combos, then Marvel Avengers is not for you. They advertised the multiplayer as the game and basically threw in a campaign, and that campaign is as basic as it can get for Marvel, so I REALLY don't understand why everyone praises it. The game should be looked at and reviewed as a multiplayer game that included a campaign. Because there is other great super hero story games out there, people just keep complaining that they didn't get another one. I liked Ultimate Alliance and I like Marvel Avengers, this is made for me to enjoy. If you cant enjoy it because you want more story, then you came to the wrong game. The game not having YOUR gameplay style in it does not make it a bad game.It's a shame to have such a great license and not put in the effort to make as great a game as possible. Not sure if the studio wasn't up to the task or if the publisher just wanted to cash in. Either way, it's a shame for Marvel.Oh man, that tagline got me. Thor-t 😂😂😂😂The review nailed it. Greed sunk this game. Who on Earth thought it would be a good idea to make this a live service rpg instead of an entertaining single-player romp?I was definitely on the fence about this game on PS4 but I’ve been hearing about the improvements. If I do get this it seems like the PS5 version is the way to go. I just need to get a darn PS5. I remember @naruball saying that campaign is at least worth the play though before.@JoshuaTChandler It’s not just the core objectives themselves that are the problem though, it’s the fact that you’re fighting the same enemies in the same environments. I also think the core combat of the cast is fun, but it needs more variety across the board — not just in WHAT you’re doing, but also the locations/enemies/etc.Hasn’t this game cost square Enix a £60 million loss?Should have focused on solely being a single player game.How do you ruin the freakin avengers?@naruball Damn you are like super hellbent on getting the other 98% of people who abandoned the game on Steam to come back lolIt's literally just a stripped down Ultimate Alliance with all the crappy monetary practices of live service games and a campaign that wastes its opportunity to use the wider Marvel Universe in its story outside Inhumans I don't care about, and an emphasis on generic A.I.M. robots instead of actual Marvel villains who show up for a single mission and then disappear with no fanfare like Taskmaster and Abomination@JoshuaTChandler Nah. Ultimate Alliance had a roster like 3x the size and actually delved way deeper into Marvel's mythos instead of trying to act like a desperate advertisment for who was relevant in the moviesThis game WISHES it was Ultimate Alliance. It's more like if the Marvel roster from MvC Infinite got their own gameI’ve been playing the game with friends and we’ve had tons of fun with it. I’ve not played the solo campaign yet because of the fun the multiplayer has been providing. That being said, the game could’ve been so much better but it fell right into the theme most licensed games fall into; “They’ll buy it because they know it.”Treat this game as a single-player game with continuous story updates and you’ll be better off.@TheFrenchiestFry if this were even 3/10 of Ultimate Alliance it would be 50x better.@naruball Its just how you look at a game a review is always something personal. Lets be honest this game would have been much better as a singleplayer game. It would not surprise me if it was build that way and a higher up suit thought no it needs too be a liveservice. As for Tekken 7 i really missed the character specific endings aka Arcade mode.@get2sammyb Good point the mediocre enemies plus environments were a big letdown for a lot of people. I think a lot of people where expecting something totally different something less mediocreIt's constantly on sale for under $20 bucks and that's well worth the campaign, and if you have a friend or two the game is a blast. Does get old quick though, but it's fun for a good week or two.This game is horribly underratedI've been enjoying it since I started playing it with the update (my first time). The marketplace is too pricey and I get tired of being in the same places a lot, but it's fun and I'm looking forward to more additional content. I couldn't care less about multiplayer. I don't like playing with other people 😆@Ryall Agree 10000%I personally really enjoyed it and have got the Platinum twice now for both versions. It definitely plays better on PS5 and by Thor those load times are astoundingly fast compared to those never ending slow mode showcases and elevator rides. Granted, it’s a slight annoyance when a multiplayer game is slowed down by cross platform but I’ve had a tonne of fun online considering I generally avoid online multiplayer. Thor is definitely still the best character by far whilst Hulk is kinda ***** but Hawkeye is surprisingly cool and with Black Panther on the horizon I’ll definitely be playing more. Yes, it’s repetitive and grindy but focus on the positive and there’s definitely enough to entertain with an ace campaign and some great combat. As for the revamped XP decision I honestly didn’t feel it affected things much. If anything it meant I hit Hero 50 and Power 150 at around the same time whilst giving me time to test out each new move and thus learn characters more than when I was spamming 5-10 skill points I’d amassed without knowing!How many times do I need to hack a computer or smash a generator? The game play loop blows.This game is an embarrassment.Meanwhile Nioh 2 complete edition has hundreds of hours (at least) of loot based action straight out of the box with no micro transactions or anti consumer rubbish, as well as far superior gameplay.@JoshuaTChandler Next gen MAU? Dude MAU3 with its DLC has over 50 playable characters from all corners of Marvel including a few playable villains as well like Thanos and Loki. It also has way more bosses like from all corners of Marvel and multiple locations from all corners of Marvel. I like Marvel's Avengers but its no where near the quality of any of the MAU games, it has deeper combat sure but its let down by a terrible live service model with barely any content, boring loot and over-priced MTX.I still regret paying full price, but sadly it's too late for me to get a full refund, and I can't be bothered trying to sell it.At least the PS5 upgrade was free, but I shall be waiting until all DLC is released before I resume playing the main story.@RBMango it doesn't matter what Square Enix wants you to do. You can choose to play the game any way you want. Just like some people only play the campaign of COD, even though it's mainly a multiplayer game.@get2sammyb I've played most of the campaign and don't see your point about ""has several missions that are designed around its multiplayer, endgame content."" Can you give me some examples? Or even one. Because nothing springs to mind.hi guys has this game an offline player campaign , or is it like that dc universe game purely online?thank you in advanceThe campaign was really good in my opinion and if they'd left it at that it would of been fine. Advertising it as a co-op multiplayer is what has done the damage, yes the combat is great fun with friends but the actual multiplayer 'endgame' missions called 'Hive' are played in single player only. Its just totally bizarre why they didn't make the hive missions multiplayer especially when you have AI teammates?! They definitely missed a trick here.Tried it on PS4 and it was alright but that's it, not interested in playing it on PS5 though. I'll stick to the Ultimate Alliance games, Ultimate Alliance 3 is a particularly good game.Just completed the main game after purchasing this for £20, which I’d argue is still too much for this the ultimate ‘meh’ game.They should have called this game pushsquare as that’s all you do in this game! Pushsquare to punch, pushsquare to open doors, pushsquare to open crates.The graphics are great, the storyline is ok. Leading with Kamala was a good idea story wise but she’s not a mainstream name like Thor or Ironman so can see why people complained about her inclusion.The levels are dull, the missions are dull, the RPG elements are dumb. In the middle of a fight I can stroll over and go looking for a crate to upgrade my bracelet by 1 point. I must have missed that in the MCU films!Everything is solved by punching, there are no puzzles, no other game elements absolutely nothing radical or revolutionary. Crash bandicoot on the ps1 had more interesting gameplay!The skins (which are truly awful) have to be bought, yet in insomniac Spider-Man they’re free if you go and look for them.This was truly an ultimate example of wasted potential that should have been handed to rocksteady or insomniac.You play as Thor, Ironman etc for a max of 2 hours each! Nowhere near enough time to unlock any skills or special moves or even care about your character or their motives. Black widow is terrible to use, her pistols do absolutely zilch.It's a fair review though personally I thought the campaign was worse than Sammy here. I'd give it 5/10 at most, if I was being generous.The worst criticism I have is that you almost never feel like a superhero. That power fantasy that gaming is so good at delivering is hidden behind a loot/grind mechanic, bullet sponge enemies designed around multiplayer and mindless bots to fight. It makes you feel pretty weak at most times, almost like Superman (excuse the DC x Marvel crossover) is fighting with Kryptonite in his worn-over pants.By the end of the game i'd unlocked barely any of the skill trees, skins or other upgrades for any characters. It's all cynically designed around grind and MTX... but doesn't even have an engaging enough loop to entice you to keep playing.This is all obfuscated behind some beloved characters, excellent production values and a few too many lens flares.There are still a few really nice moments (no spoilers) and I liked Kamala and most of the cast, it just failed at the one thing superhero games should deliver... being a superhero.Honestly there are many better games to use your time on and many better games that deserve your support. This doesn't, or we will see more of it's like.@themightyant I couldn't disagree more with the second paragraph. Playing as Thor, for example, makes you feel like an absolute God. He's incredibly powerful, even against strong enemies. I felt the same in the campaign when he first appeared, i.e. that he's leagues ahead of the rest of the team.@naruball I said ALMOST never felt like a superhero. That Thor moment was one of the few where you did, it was a great entrance. But those moments were few and far between for me. Then you return to mindlessly swinging at rinse and repeat droids with almost no visceral feeling to any attacks. Combat is so floaty like you are fighting with wet noodles.Honestly I went in late, for free, and with the very lowest of expectations yet still hated it.Regardless there's room for multiple views if you felt differently, that was just my 2 cents.

Marvel's Avengers,John-Paul Jones,PlayStation Universe,https://www.psu.com/reviews/marvels-avengers-review-ps5-a-worthwhile-upgrade-that-benefits-from-the-passage-of-time/," John-Paul Jones / March 24, 2021Marvel’s Avengers PS5 review. When you look at the totality of issues that Marvel’s Avengers had when it originally launched (and for sometime after), it’s pretty clear that other than some framerate drops here and there, that a lack of technical sheen was hardly among them. Quite simply, the issues which have plagued Marvel’s Avengers since its release are those which have troubled every live service game since their inception – namely content and the lack thereof.With more than six months on the clock since its somewhat troubled release back in September 2020, Marvel’s Avengers PlayStation 5 debut is certainly something of a different proposition than it was last year. More than just a prettier take on what PlayStation 4 owners have already been playing, Marvel’s Avengers delayed PS5 release also brings it with a multitude of bug-fixing updates and some much needed additional content too. For a more detailed critique of Marvel’s Avengers core systems and mechanics, we would encourage you to swing back to our original PS4 review of the game.First though, the new stuff. Befitting the newer and much more powerful hardware that is hosting the experience this time around, Marvel’s Avengers now looks much better than it ever did on either PS4 or PS4 Pro. Though the resolution mode dishes out a crystal clear 4K presentation with some additional environmental details to boot, it’s in the performance mode that Marvel’s Avengers on PS5 really shines.As has been the case for many titles that have unlocked a smoother framerate on PS5, playing Marvel’s Avengers on Sony’s latest console represents a significant improvement over what either the PS4 or PS4 Pro consoles are capable of. Though Marvel’s Avengers on PS5 doesn’t always rigidly stick to its 60 FPS cap, it is so much smoother than what we’ve had before that the game simply feel better to play on account of the improved responsiveness and far fewer instances of slowdown during busy battles.Of course, there are drawbacks with choosing performance mode over resolution mode. The first being that don’t have the same sharpness as you do in resolution mode and while this isn’t really an issue for much of the game, it’s still a noticeable drop in resolution and one that is keenly observed in the menu text which becomes sadly more blurry as a result. The other drawback is the general drop in texture detail and environmental destruction too, but to be honest both of these drawbacks still aren’t enough to negate the sizable advantages that the performance mode provides in terms of sheer smoothness and improved responsiveness.Further Reading: All PS4 Games That Perform Better On PS5Beyond the obvious visual improvements made in the PS5 version of Marvel’s Avengers, the arrival of Earth’s Mightiest Heroes on PlayStation 5 also brings with it the expected DualSense features too. The pad rumbles duly as damage is both given and taken during battles, while the adaptive triggers provide a palpable feeling of tautness and resistance when unleashing ranged attacks. It’s nothing especially ground-breaking, but it’s certainly nice to have it all the same.Of greater impact though are the loading times. Practically instantaneous, loading up a campaign mission or shifting from one location to the next has never been more effortless and it’s telling that the only times you have to wait is in when you’re connecting with other players online.And then we come to the game itself. As I’ve already alluded to earlier in this review, Marvel’s Avengers arrives on PlayStation 5 with more than half a year’s worth of fixes and updates applied to it. In reality, this means that many of the bugs, glitches and game-breaking issues which troubled the game during its launch on PS4 last year are simply not there anymore.Equally in that same span of time, Marvel’s Avengers has also received two fairly chunky slabs of content in the form of the ‘Taking A.I.M’ and ‘Future Imperfect’ DLC expansions which introduced us to Kate Bishop and mentor Clint ‘Hawkeye’ Barton respectively. Though the promised Spider-Man content remains some way off.Now, while the much needed injection of content is welcome and arguably essential to the success of Marvel’s Avengers lest it fall to the same fate as EA’s Anthem, it remains to be seen just how constantly Square-Enix and developer Crystal Dynamics can keep the content faucet running. As such, because content roadmaps can never explicitly guarantee anything, we could fall into that same rut where the game is being starved of content. Being optimistic though, we have the new Black Panther content due before the end of the summer, so at least if the content roadmap is delivered upon then players should find themselves suitably satisfied.Perhaps the main problem with Marvel’s Avengers though, is that the developer is struggling to get out of its own way somewhat. Sure, the proposed content roadmap is enticing and well-timed for the game’s PS5 debut, but the changes to level balancing where it takes longer to level than it did previously, smacks of naivety and padding, which is the last thing that newcomers to the game would want to experience. Additionally, an unnecessarily convoluted save transfer process between the PS4 and PS5 versions of the game doesn’t help matters either.In the end though, actually taking control of Marvel’s superheroes proves to be as intoxicatingly enjoyable as it ever was. Freshly embellished by the PS5’s DualSense shenanigans, throwing Thor’s hammer or pulling off a quadruple repulsor attack combo has never felt better. Furthermore, Marvel’s Avengers single-player campaign still manages to enthral with the improved visuals applying an opulent sheen to one of the more enjoyable story campaigns of recent years.With much improved visuals, a solid gameplay core (other than some questionable levelling design decisions), some much needed additional content and a fairly ambitious DLC roadmap laid out before it, if you’ve been waiting to play Marvel’s Avengers, now is the time to get stuck in. The game is in much better state than it was at launch; let’s just hope that the golden content faucet doesn’t suddenly turn off anytime soon.Marvel’s Avengers is out now, with a free PS5 upgrade to owners of the PS4 version.Original code kindly provided by PR.Though Marvel's Avengers makes a superhero-sized splash on PlayStation 5, this is still at its core the same game we had back in September 2020. That said, the improved visuals and passage of time both mean that Marvel's Avengers on PS5 is essentially now the definitive version of the game, boasting much more responsive gameplay and a wealth of bug fixes and quality of life improvements. Though no amount of extra pixels or DualSense features can transform the game, the fact that Marvel's Avengers is actually enjoying a fairly steady stream of worthwhile content should be reassuring to those who have been sat on the fence for the superpowered caper. In short, if you've been sitting Marvel's Avengers out, now is the time to jump in.

Marvel's Avengers,Nathan Carter,Gaming Nexus,https://www.gamingnexus.com/Article/6179/Marvels-Avengers/,"When the Avengers was first announced, I was extremely excited. Then we got the first gameplay video and I was...confused. That confusion went on for months, pretty much up until they released the first War Table videos as to what exactly we would be doing in this game. After seeing the in-depth videos a few months ago, I was still a little apprehensive. After finishing the campaign and putting in more hours into the multiplayer it seems my fears were in fact true. While the story of the campaign is compelling and great, everything else about the game is repetitive to the point where it feels like this game was sent out unfinished. First things first: the campaign was great, I'll give them that. The story starts off with you following Kamala Khan, a Marvel fangirl who becomes a finalist in a fan fiction contest and gets to meet all the Avengers at a fan convention. Of course this doesn't go completely as planned and San Francisco is attacked. Thanks to the arrogance of the Avengers, however, they end up destroying the entire city, killing thousands of people and infecting the remaining survivors, Kamala included, giving them super powers. Those with superpowers become ""Inhumans.""The story skips ahead a number of years and still follows Kamala as she is trying to escape capture, experimentation, and execution at the hands of the main antagonists, AIM. AIM are essentially heroes in the eyes of the general public and the Avengers are seen as terrorists. Now, while the story is great, there is a big problem with the structure of the game. It's perfectly fine for story reasons that you don't have all the Avengers at the start, but it takes way, way too long to assemble the entire team.The first five or six hours of the game have you playing as just Kamala and then the Hulk. Only then do you get access to the mission selection screen called the War Table. Even then you won't get all the Avengers unless you rush all the main story missions. But once you do finally start getting the Avengers, the story starts getting really good. Even though I found her incredibly obnoxious, it was nice to see the underdog story of Kamala go from fangirl to pretty much being a member of the Avengers herself. For spoiler reasons I won't give any details for the post-game story, but unfortunately it's not as compelling or as fun as the main campaign. That's because at this point you realize just how repetitive the missions are. And it's not just the objectives either, its the maps themselves. If these missions involve infiltrating an AIM lab, then get ready to experience some deja vu because AIM, like Wal-Mart, likes all of their locations to pretty much look exactly the same with copy-paste layouts and hallways.Most objectives are Domination style maps where you have to hold points while preventing the enemies from taking them, freeing hostages or destroying enemy equipment. It's fun the first few times but gets really old after a while. Marvel's Avengers just launched but this is going to be one of those games that will probably need a re-review years down the line. Unfortunately I can only review what I have now—and what we've got is just okay. Not terrible, not amazing, but it could have been so much more than what it currently is.As for the gameplay itself, playing as each of the Avengers is incredibly fun. I would say that's the most important part of the game. Each of the Avengers feels different enough with their own special skills and abilities that if things start to get old you can switch characters for some variety. Thor and Iron Man are my favorites. Hitting enemies with Thor's hammer never gets old and Iron Man's rockets can completely clear out entire groups of enemies in seconds. Leveling up the characters gives you points to use on their skill trees which lets you unlock new attacks and special moves. After finishing the campaign, however, this is also where you see the cracks forming.With this kind of game the missions are meant to be replayed multiple times. On each stage you can find gear and resources for each character. Each character in the game has four different gear slots which all increase or decrease their stats. You can also boost gear with resources you find around the maps. I actually like the gear system as it allows you to create various builds for each character. For instance there are some gear pieces that will raise your melee damage but reduce everything else. So you could essentially build Hulk as an all out tank by giving him gear that boosts all his defense. The only disappointment here is that there is a lot of cool looking gear you can pick up but it doesn't change the look of your character at all. Speaking of looks, each character in the game has their own free battle pass and there is no premium track. The battle pass will give skins, takedowns, gear, title cards and currency.However, I have a problem with these and it's how you gain levels for each character. I played a lot of Ms. Marvel and Thor, and when I went to check their battle passes, I realized I'd made no progress. That's when I also realized that the only way you can make progress on each characters card is by completing challenges. You get two daily challenges and two weekly challenges. I get that the battle passes are free but, come on, we don't get any progress for just playing like other battle passes do? Then of course, as this is a service game, there are microtransactions and a store where you can buy new outfits and emotes. Now, I understand games like this need a constant flow of money coming in to be able to produce new content. That's fine but the prices here are just outrageous. We are talking almost $15 for a single Legendary skin and like $12 for a Takedown. Ridiculous.On the technical side of things the game looks and sounds great. I do find it kind of funny, though, that all the Avengers look and sound just enough like their MCU counterparts without crossing the line to where they would have to pay the actors loyalties. The game really feels like an MCU movie with fantastic cinematic battle sequences full of intense action and sequences.While the game looks and sounds find, the way it plays is another story. There is a major problem with the horrific performance once the level gets cluttered with enemies. I played on a base PS4 console. With some games, you may get some slowdown and it's not really a big deal. With Avengers, during big fights, the framerate completely tanks to unacceptable levels. It looks like you are watching a slideshow. This isn't something that only happens a couple of times. It happens all the time. Marvel Avengers has potential. The campaign was great but if this game is going to retain players it's going to need a steady stream of content—and fast. As of now, there isn't really much to do after finishing the campaign except for grinding out the same repetitive missions and objectives over and over again. And the absolutely unacceptable frame rate issues need to be fixed immediately. As it stands now, the campaign is great, and playing as each of the Avengers is fun, but the game just offers too little post-campaign content to warrant continued play. The performance issues are just unacceptable for a AAA game of this caliber. It's clear that this game should have released later in the year or delayed for another year. It really feels like this is yet another game shoved out the door while saying, ""We'll fix it later.""* The product in this article was sent to us by the developer/company.I have been playing video games for as long as I can remember.

Marvel’s Avengers by Crystal Dynamics and Square Enix is a game that could have impressed back during the early days of this console generation. However, the title’s hodgepodge of mechanics seems tiring at this point. There are some bright spots in this game, but every aspect seems undercooked. And at worst, some even feel at odds with themselves.The story is where the game shines the brightest. It focuses squarely on Kamala Khan, and her youthful enthusiasm really injects some much needed personality into the somewhat soulless gameplay. The story starts off with a younger Kamala as she witnessed the events of A-Day. As the events of the game play out, Kamala really grows as a person, figuratively and literally. It’s great to see her idolize the Avengers as a young girl and then find her place within the world as an Avenger. While the pacing isn’t perfect, you feel a real sense of character progression with her.While I praise the game’s story, the actual campaign structure leaves a lot to be desired. There are some really great set pieces here and there, but in-between you have these dull open-world maps where you traverse between enemy outposts until you end up where your primary objective is, which is usually… a bigger base in the form of an enemy laboratory.The entire enemy stronghold game design, popularized this generation by studios like Ubisoft, isn’t inherently a bad thing. Ghost of Tsushima had a similar structure, and I enjoyed that game very much. But while Sucker Punch’s game had stellar art direction and great fast travel functions, the open areas in Marvel’s Avengers just feel lifeless. At one point during the campaign, I stopped going to the outposts and went straight to the objective. The loot placed at these outposts wasn’t enough to incentivize me.That’s a problem because Marvel’s Avengers’ hook is its loot and gear system. The gear comes in five ascending tiers, starting from Common all the way to Legendary, and each Avenger has four primary slots for gear. Different pieces of gear can come with different kinds of perks. You may have a piece of loot that decreases the amount of damage taken when at a certain percentage of health or another that can add damage to a specific type of attack.While these effects can add nuance to the gameplay, they always feel quite underwhelming. This is because none of the hits you land really feel like they’re making an impact. Sure, stringing together combos is definitely possible, but many times you’re going to get hit by a rocket or laser off-screen, thus completely interrupting your attacks. Even as the Hulk, I feel as if I’m hitting with the force of a wet paper bag. Enemies take a while to go down, and there are usually a lot of enemies coming towards you at once.It doesn’t help that these enemies seem to love using unblockable attacks as often as possible, which are indicated by a flashing red circle. Most of the time I try to hit them out of it, but they’re somehow impervious to any sort of hitstun.I feel like Marvel’s Avengers’ mechanics are working against each other here and the game is confused on what it wants to be. The introduction scene of the game’s campaign, as well as the ending, features some really cool cinematic moments. But throughout the campaign, it’s burdened with all of the game-as-a-service elements.Each Avenger has a skill tree that’s reminiscent of a single-player role-playing game and provides a sense of progression. The loot mechanics just don’t need to be there though and at times feel like a complete mismatch with the game. Additionally, there are only about three or four battles in the whole campaign that involve fighting actual Marvel supervillains, which is pretty disappointing for a superhero game.Looking at Marvel’s Avengers as a multiplayer game, I’m not sure how the loot really compels me to keep grinding. The user interface takes heavy inspiration from Destiny’s, but unlike in that game, there are no cosmetic changes with new gear. Part of the draw of Destiny’s gear is that each has a distinctive look and players can form their own identity through how they appear. I just can’t see that here.I believe that’s the consequence of working with one of the biggest IPs in entertainment. I wouldn’t be surprised if any outward cosmetic changes would have required Square Enix to get the approval of the corporate overlords at Disney. Given all the administrative complexity and the amount of time that would take, electing to go with just skins and non-cosmetic gear was probably the easiest route.There are some smaller annoying details too. Marvel’s Avengers is pretty buggy. During a particular boss battle, if I chained together two specific attacking abilities, my game would always crash. Also during the campaign, if you fail a stealth section or fall during a set piece, the game has to load up the area again. The load times on my PlayStation 4 Pro are excruciatingly long and add insult to injury.I will say, however, that the game can be fun when playing with friends. Coordinating strategies with human players is much more fulfilling than depending on the ally AI to help wipe out enemies. Your AI teammates are actually pretty dependable though. If you get downed during battle, you don’t have to worry all that much about whether or not they’ll be able to revive you: They will. They also do a good-enough job keeping enemies distracted and busy.Square Enix heavily marketed the title as a games-as-a-service affair, so a long road is ahead. With a substantial amount of new content in the future, as well as some variety in mission objectives, Marvel’s Avengers could be worth a player’s time and effort. At the very least, the roughly 8-10 hour campaign is worth experiencing if only for the amazing portrayal of Kamala Khan. Right now, though, you may want to steer clear until more updates arrive.

Marvel's Avengers,Liam Croft,Push Square,http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/marvels_avengers,"GuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpMarvel's Avengers2020 6.0Game RatingUser Ratings: 38Our Review: Scroll DownGuardians of the GaaSVersion Reviewed: PS4 Pro / EuropeanRepublished on Wednesday, 13th July, 2022: We're bringing this review back from the archives following the announcement of July's PS Plus Extra, Premium lineup. The original text follows.If anything, Marvel's Avengers has become the victim of its own marketing cycle. Pitched under the Games as a Service banner, loot to grind for, repeatable missions, bounties, daily and weekly tasks, and microtransactions are all very much a part of this superhero undertaking. However, it is also so much more than that. Crystal Dynamics has shied away from showing off its latest single player campaign prior to launch and that's a real shame. It is far and away the best thing about Marvel's Avengers.Yes, pre-release marketing might not have made it clear, but what the California-based studio decided to do after Rise of the Tomb Raider does indeed feature a narrative-driven campaign. You do not need to team up with other players online, you do not need to invest any extra cash beyond the initial $60 price point, and you do not need to grind for better gear to see the story through to its conclusion. This is a traditional experience that lets you ignore its online trappings completely until the credits roll.And the star of the show is Kamala Khan. It might be a story about the Avengers, but Ms. Marvel is the protagonist. After the superhero task force is framed for a devastating attack on San Francisco, the Inhuman of Pakistani American origin takes it upon herself to reassemble the Avengers and take the fight to AIM — the corporation who benefited from the downfall of Marvel’s larger-than-life characters. Khan believes she has found a piece of evidence that proves the Avengers were not complicit in the destruction of SF and will stop at nothing to get it in the right hands.What follows is a 15-hour, globe-trotting campaign packed full of the sort of action, set-pieces, and quips you would expect out of any typical Marvel movie. Hulk, Iron Man, Black Widow, Thor, and Captain America (of course he isn't dead) all have their moment in the limelight, but the narrative keeps on coming back to Kamala Khan. Despite one too many convenient coincidences, the instantly lovable character becomes the driving force behind nearly every story beat and the high-octane battles in-between. Much like her comic book debut, Ms. Marvel stakes her claim for the lead role and never looks back. She's an absolute triumph of a superhero.Better yet, there's a star-studded cast of voice actors on board to support the newcomer. Troy Baker is at the point where any of the characters he plays sound exactly like him, but he does a good job of fulfilling the bumbling role of Bruce Banner. Nolan North, meanwhile, captures the witty, stuck-up persona of Tony Stark to a tee.And although these personalities might be the reason you were on board with Marvel's Avengers from the very beginning, it's the combat that will have you coming back for more. Each of the six characters play differently from one another, and along with three different skill trees for each, you can customise them to fulfil a variety of different roles. Everyone covers the basic light, heavy, and ranged attacks to quickly turn this into a third-person brawler, but there's hardly any button mashing to be had. Combos can be struck up at a moment's notice, takedowns leave most enemies for dead, and both support and damage-minded abilities leave behind a wasteland of destruction.There's a genuinely deep set of mechanics to explore here — both on a surface level in the pursuit of quick-fire action and the ability to personalise your chosen superhero's build. It was never going to beat the Leviathan Axe from God of War, but there's a distinct level of satisfaction to be gained from throwing Captain America's shield and watching it bounce between enemies, dealing damage as it goes. In full motion, it's outstanding to watch.What might be even more impressive, though, is that Crystal Dynamics really has managed to make the six superheroes feel and play differently from one another. Iron Man can take to the skies and reign terror down from above with Repulsors, Black Widow is a silent assassin with the Veil of Shadows ability that turns her and anyone nearby invisible, and Hulk plays the classic role of the tank. Kamala Khan, Thor, and Captain America all feel like they fit somewhere in-between these three extremes, but there's enough nuance to ensure they don't all play the same.Enemy variety isn't so up to par, however. The forces of AIM largely consist of robots that lack the brainpower to do much more than run at your mighty fists and meet their untimely demise. Some come equipped with shields while others pin their hopes of safety on jet packs, but their attacks remain much the same. It can make combat feel a little mindless sometimes, relying on the player to bring about some creativity. Even the boss fights are few and far between. Those that are there are particularly impressive, especially in the final few hours of the campaign. However, given the comic book universe Crystal Dynamics has at its fingertips, it is surprising to see so few of its villains realised in video game form.Outside of brawling, Marvel's Avengers even channels its developer's previous efforts with set-pieces that wouldn’t look out of place in the rebooted Tomb Raider franchise. You will find yourself making great leaps as Kamala Khan, wall running as Captain America, and kicking Iron Man's suit into overdrive to beat an in-game timer. These moments are a welcome break from combat, despite how enjoyable it may be.And then the credits roll. This is the point where many players will lose interest in Marvel's Avengers, but even those looking for a replacement to Destiny 2 might not find what they're looking for. The endgame content is lacking beyond belief at launch, simply put. A couple of new mission chains do open up, some even with their own unique cutscenes, except they simply serve to reinforce the fact that you will essentially be repeating content from here on out.Clones of previous boss fights serve as daily quests, War Zone missions use the exact same interiors and environments from mainline assignments, and objectives become staler than ever before. Even the more open-ended levels with optional tasks to complete are recycled over and over again. It gets to the point where quests send you to the exact same place multiple times, but try to disguise it as a different location entirely despite re-used assets and environments.Now, this is nothing new for these types of experiences — Destiny did it and so too does The Division 2 right now to some extent. However, never has it been so blatantly obvious. Stripped of its narrative stakes and engaging dialogue, the gameplay of Marvel's Avengers relies on its combat so heavily that you start to see it crack under the pressure. As good as those fights are, the game is going to need something more if it hopes to retain a player base months after launch. It feels like the world has moved on from repeating the same levels over and over again for an insignificant statistical upgrade to your character.We mention stats because the loot you are picking up has absolutely no affect on the look of your chosen superhero. It's a baffling decision because it strips the loot system of any creativity, instead limiting it to the minor boosts items come with. As such, equipping a new exotic piece is completely unexciting as it claims to affect what's under the hood rather than decals visible to the human eye.It doesn't have anything even remotely close to Destiny's Gjallahorn moment, and the only ways you can unlock new skins revolve around luck, grinding, and microtransactions. The game's equivalent of a Battle Pass hands out outfits for free, but you're limited by how much progress you can make each day. Meanwhile, the in-game marketplace sells legendary skins for roughly $15 apiece. That's a pricey proposition indeed, but it's up to you decide if that is particularly egregious or not. What we can say is that cosmetic customisation is not one of the title's strong points.And so we find ourselves in the same position that so many Games as a Service have been in before — the endgame of Marvel's Avengers is lacking at launch, but with the promise of long-term support, it could look completely different in a year's time. Multiple superheroes have already been confirmed to be free additions down the line with even more expected after that. We don't know what the Crystal Dynamics project will look like this time next year, but at the point where you are being asked to make a $60 investment, it doesn't live up to expectations.One thing the developer will absolutely have to address, however, is the game's shocking framerate. It targets 30 frames-per-second but rarely achieves it in combat scenarios as the screen becomes littered with action, enemies, and debris. The PS4 Pro doesn't seem to be able to keep up with what Marvel's Avengers is putting out, forcing the frame rate to plummet into the teens on a worryingly regular basis. If anything, the upcoming PlayStation 5 version should do wonders for the title.That doesn't excuse the copious amount of bugs and glitches present at launch, though. From hard crashes that force you into restarting the game through to comedic flaws which see Thor glitch all over the place as he attempts to fly, it has the lot. Enemies become suspended in mid-air, weekly challenges don't actually reset, a game-breaking bug ruins any enjoyment in HARM Rooms, and jarring transitions between gameplay and cutscenes can ruin any immersion. It's definitely not the best state to release in, that's for sure.Marvel's Avengers' least advertised aspect turns out to be its greatest asset, and it's exactly what hardcore fans were craving the most. The story and everything that comes with it is a real highlight, allowing the exceptional Kamala Khan to take the lead and bring with her enjoyable combat systems and fun parkour. The shocking framerate, along with bugs and glitches, should be fixed in the near future, but it's what the game has you do after the credits roll that quickly becomes its biggest downfall. Marvel's Avengers has a single player campaign that thoroughly excites, surprises, and delights. What follows brings it crashing back down to Earth.Not Bad 6/10Scoring PolicyReview copy provided by Square EnixPlease note that some external links on this page are affiliate links, which means if you click them and make a purchase we may receive a small percentage of the sale.

That's all I, and many others who care mostly about the single player content, wanted to know.""The game's equivalent of a Battle Pass hands out outfits for free, but you're limited by how much progress you can make each day.""Yay more garbage designed to frustrate you into coughing up cash for crap cosmetics. Aren't live services just wonderful?I just finished the single player campaign last night and really enjoyed it. Not going to bother with all the multiplayer crap. Just going to pretend it doesn't exist!The single player campaign really interests me, but all of the post-game stuff looks horrendous. I think I'll get it when the price has been slashed a bitReally balanced review @LiamCroft. Enjoyed the read and it has led me to believe that I'll wait for price reductions before having as I have zilch interest in the GaaS but the campaign sounds fun.@Rudy_Manchego Thanks! I absolutely think it's worth picking up for the single player alone when it's half price or thereabouts.I've only had time to play a few hours of the story but so far the narrative is so good it makes it worth the purchase for me (But I'm a big Kamala fan). I'd say it's better then any of the marvel movies just in terms of story.I also find the combat really satisfying and think that will be enough to keep me coming back to grind. It reminds me a lot of a Kirby or Mario game, where the action of just controlling your character feels so good that's it's just enjoyable to run around and play just because it's fun do.I kinda wish you could buy a story only version at a reduced cost that cuts out all the 'games as a service', multiplayer and end of game grindy stuff because thats all id want from this. The rest just feels like a way to try and bleed my wallet dry at every given opportunity.I'll pick it up when it's sub-$30 for Kamala, though the endless onslaught of robots is disappointing. I even got tired of fighting them in the beta. The call of cosmetics would have had me more interested in the multiplayer, honestly. That truly was a dumb decision.I might play the single player bit one day if it's on sale but I'm not bothering with the open-wallet surgery multiplayer rubbish.I'm happy to be wrong about this one. Kamala is the best. I'm an X-Men fan, and didn't really know much about her outside of Inhumans Vs X-Men, but she instantly likeable in this.I haven't touched online still so, meh. Don't care about that.Thank you for adressing the technical state of the game. I wrote in the WRC Review that I would really appreciate if you guys could go more into the technical side of the games and you guys listened, so thank you very much!This seems to be the general consensus, although 6/10 is better than I was expecting so perhaps it is worth picking up after a really massive price drop.I’m intending to play this on PS5. Hopefully the digital foundry types will do an analysis to tell me whether that would fix the problems.@RBMango Not just cosmetics, but also hard to acquire resources that help upgrade gear. THAT part is annoying... I can leave the dress up roleplaying to the kids, I just wanted the resources that are locked behind a paywall.@LiamCroft Yeah think I might.The crazy thing about this GAAS backlash is that if they had released a 20 hour solid campaign and then charged for regular story based DLC with new or existing characters, I'd probably be quite interested in playing more of the same and pay for it.@ohhaime I’m gonna let you in a little fun part. Once you get to the last mission and Tony gives out Starktech outfits... pay close attention. Kamala has the absolute best line in the whole game and it had me rolling. I won’t spoil it, but just pay extra attention to the cut scene.Very well written article, shares about the same sentiments as I have... but... I’ll add one more con.CON: Can’t replay campaign missions. Warning for those who haven’t finished the Titan mission. FIND THE BOX that gives you a DNA unlock key, you’ll need it later. I don’t know how I missed it, probably because Jarvis kept screaming to hurry up and probably some timer or something... but so far, have had to leave several other boxes locked and unopened because I missed that one key.So take away the lifeservice and some extra polis and it would have been great.@Lodogg3323 Oh God, I didn't even know about that.Considering the frame rate issues, I guess I'll wait to play it on ps5. By then it will undoubtedly cost less than it does now.But wait, I thought that live services only made games better and more enjoyable...I’ll get this at a price drop.I just can’t be bothered with this uninspired GaaS game.@LiamCroft great review, very well written and very fair. I've only dipped in and out of this game, because truth be told, I bought it for my Marvel obsessed kids. My 10 year old got the platinum for Spiderman, and has been playing this game not stop for the past few weeks. He loves it, and says it's just as good as Spiderman. Neither of us have played the online content yet, but my son has completed the main story and is now playing the extra content. It's funny, but as you say it's very repetitive, I found the exact same thing in Spiderman's extra missions. But my son is enjoying the extra content more than the Spiderman ones. I guess we'll see how the online stuff goes in the next few months, and see how he likes that. I'm not a big online person, so I can't comment on that. One thing I will say, the promise of more characters (especially Spiderman!) has my son super excited for the future of this game. So although I think the 6/10 you gave is probably very fair, I'd have to give it an extra couple of marks due to the experience of someone who the game was totally aimed at, and their aim was spot on!At £50 it’s just not worth it for a relatively decent 15 hour campaign. At this rate it’s basically a Call of Duty game.From what I have read, the game also seems to have some dialogue issues.@Jakovasaur In all fairness he does write:""And so we find ourselves in the same position that so many Games as a Service have been in before — the endgame of Marvel's Avengers is lacking at launch, but with the promise of long-term support, it could look completely different in a year's time.""https://www.gosunoob.com/marvels-avengers/dna-key-locations-and-farming/I may have been wrong on DNA keys... I’ve only been playing 4 days, mistakes are bound to happen.Seems like a balanced review. On the whole I do look forward to playing the campaign. The bugs and frame rate issues are little disappointing but I assume much of that will have been addressed by the time it's on sale.One thing I will say is this new trend of rushing an unfinished game seems to reward restraint at launch. I can't see that being a winning strategy unless devs are confident they'll recoup in the long term through monetization. Still seems counterintuitive to me though.Didn't they said there will be NO PAID content?@djlard No, Crystal Dynamics said that additional characters and all the gameplay elements that come with them will be free.I'd go 7/10. My issues are the interrupted attacks. I hate that, because we can't interrupt the a.i. and I don't like having to play other heroes to level them..i with it was more like ultimate alliance where they still level up if the cpu controls them.Could have been another P2W Mobile Game imp.That's all.Yep great campaign and really worth playing. As for the live service side i find it fun but lacking, really though the biggest issue right now is the sheer amount of bugs what range from minor to major to gamebraking to game ending.Good, I hope this game fizzles out deserves it with their console exclusive characters ***** any game and company that does that.got the score it deserves. fair review.@Lodogg3323 you get dna keys every time you compleat villian sector. I've used quite a few so far.For me it's a 8I have a lot of fun with this game@W0rl0ck I’m doing something wrong, still don’t have one... I’m sure I’ll figure it out and it’ll be something so stupid and obvious...Edit...Ok. Face meet palm... under Objectives, under Missions... ok... got it. I’m blaming Spidey’s girlfriend for that one. 😜🔥🌿💨@Lodogg3323 You can pick up 2 villian sector missions each day, 1 from the shield agent and one from the inhuman agent This review is awful. Stop defending this crap game. You obviously sold your soul and getting paid by the devs to defend this. Please no one take this review serious and please whatever you do DO NOT BUY this game.First of all the User review on this site says the exact opposite of what you're saying. So its funny your own website/fanbase disagrees with youSecond how is the combat and boss fights good? Its literally just a button smasher. Super easy too as you can create super OP builds. This game is no challenge at allThird. All the enemies are street thugs or robot AI. How is that good variety?Kamala Khan isn't necessarily a BAD character but she shouldn't be the main character in a Avengers game. Marvel has hundreds of heroes and villains and so many unique side characters, the comic book Avengers had over 20 heroes! We are all drawn to a separate character, and each of the heroes has brought in so many fans and money to the franchise. So really there is no singular factor or character that can define the Avengers as every Avenger contributes to the franchise itself. Its true arrogance for developers to FORCE one Avenger down everyone's throat and make them the MAIN Avenger. Avengers isn't an Anime like Naruto or DBZ, there is no ""chosen one"" or protagonist, so why did it have a main character at all? It should have just let us play with whoever we wanted from the start or just let us customize our own hero, that would have made the game much more successfulAlso how is the story good when we all know the ending? Obviously Cap ain't dead and of course the big baddie is an idiot who loses at the end. Lol nothing interesting or complex about that at all. Whats the point of the whole beginning arc of the Avengers disbanding if their going reunite after a single mission? Its not like there was any real stakes and we know the good guys won't die.I just destroyed All of your pros. Its a ***** game. Stop defending it Liam!Better than I expected, If the single player content increases over time I may well look into it down the line. Next gen should solve performance issues we should hope and give them time to squash the bugs. But it looks more like a £20 quite weekend buy than anything to get excited by@ReadytoDestroy I think you'll find this sites community is perhaps a little more mature than expecting childish rants from both its writers and commentors. A little respect and maturity to engage with those who may not agree with you goes a long way in life@W0rl0ck Part of one is a sabotage and my IronMan is 14/44 and I never did the Harm training and now it’s sooooo hard. I’ve spent the last however long it’s been just trying to get past that 3rd wave. Smh...@ReadytoDestroy dude. You’re harshing the vibe.@ReadytoDestroy Well at least you're living up to your username 🤷I also hate this game and I still think that's a fair score for what the game has to offer. I think a delay and a severe reduction in microtransactions would have made this game decent.I guess TL;DR version goes:Play it as single player and you’ll be happy. Play it as looter game and you’ll hate it.I don’t care about the multiplayer component and so far have a lot of fun with the game.I’ll be looking forward to more story content.I did not expect such low ratings. I pre-order it and nothing I can do about it now, just to enjoy the game as much as possible. I love superhero movies and games and I bought the game without hesitation.@ReadytoDestroy you destroyed nothing no matter what you tell yourself.Can you imagined if this is a full single player story games with no gaas and all of the budget for the games development is 100% go to the single player part? I think it will have the chance to be the best selling superheroes games of all times I think this is a really fair review, well written and some great points. The campaign is a huge attraction, but i'll be patient for the bugs to be fixed.@ReadytoDestroy what a gem of a comment. had a good laugh. thank you, sir.Couple of friends have been playing for the last few days and convinced me to play with them. We've been looking for a new coop so I used my $5 off monthly coupon and picked it up. Played last night with them for a few mins. It was fun will probably dig into the campaign next week and just hop in on some missions with them till I can find real time.I was on the fence about picking this up as I'd heard the single player is really good, but I just don't like the look of Kamala as a character. I mean, being stretchy? It's like buying infamous and having to play half the game as Delsin's friend who has the unique power of long arms.It's a game about the avengers, I want to play as them not focus on some unknown fangirl, no matter how well done it is.Slinging Cap's shield and running around as the God of Thunder is extremely fun, it just sucks that the end game content doesn't live up to the res of the gameThis is a truly fair review! I was unable to cancel my pre-order but despite owning the game now, I will be holding off until next year when all of the DLC should be out.I refuse to play thru an incomplete game.The single player campaign sounds like great fun.Think I'll wait for a) a price drop and b) for the game to be out of beta though.It's a fair review though personally I thought the campaign was worse than Liam here. I'd give it 5/10 at most, if I was being generous.The worst criticism I have is that you almost never feel like a superhero. That power fantasy that gaming is so good at delivering is hidden behind a loot/grind mechanic, bullet sponge enemies designed around multiplayer and mindless bots to fight. It makes you feel pretty weak at most times, almost like Superman (excuse the DC x Marvel crossover) is fighting with Kryptonite in his worn-over pants.By the end of the game i'd unlocked barely any of the skill trees, skins or other upgrades for any characters. It's all cynically designed around grind and MTX... but doesn't even have an engaging enough loop to entice you to keep playing.This is all obfuscated behind some beloved characters, excellent production values and a few too many lens flares.There are still a few really nice moments (no spoilers) and I liked Kamala and most of the cast, it just failed at the one thing superhero games should deliver... being a superhero.Honestly there are many better games to use your time on and many better games that deserve your support. This doesn't, or we will see more of it's like.

Marvel's Avengers,James Paley,COGconnected,https://cogconnected.com/review/marvels-avengers-review/,"Superheroes are a tough genre to tackle in any medium. They come with decades of context, a tangled web of canonical development, and some truly dedicated fans. Marvel’s Avengers is in an even tougher spot for a couple of reasons. Marvel heroes have never been more popular, and this is actually two games. Sort of. The multiplayer is such a separate beast, in both execution and anticipation, that some powering up will be required first. But how about that campaign?The story revolves around Kamala Khan and her journey to becoming Ms. Marvel. From her humble beginnings as a superfan, to her awakening as a superfan who is also an Avenger, you’re there every step of the way. At first, I was thoroughly annoyed by Khan’s enthusiasm, but she grows on you. Throughout the campaign, you cycle through each of the heroes, with Ms. Marvel taking center stage. Overall the writing is perfectly adequate, though there are a handful of touching moments. On the other hand, get ready for a parade of Movie Moments re-packaged for this story. Actually, let’s take a moment to address the MCU elephant in the room.Marvel’s Avengers can’t quite decide how much like the MCU it wants to be. All of the outfits, the technology, and the characters feel achingly familiar. It’s like a drumbeat of deja vu, running below the actual soundtrack. Some similarities are a given, but there are little things that feel a bit uncanny valley. Iron Man’s suits look, and sound, exactly like they do in the films. The MCU’s habit of never referring to people by their actual superhero names unless absolutely necessary also continues here. Some of this is just a symptom of the comics and the movies slowly syncing up. Which is fine! But for fans of the films, a lot of this game will perch on the tip of your tongue.Combat! The old pun and punch dance, long a staple of superhero stories, is writ large all over this game. All of my fights fell into two categories: ‘easy’ and ‘eventually changing the difficulty setting to easy.’ Sometimes you can just mash and bash your way to glory, while other fights require a cruel amount of finesse. Plus, in order for the game to be balanced at all, a flattening of power is essential. This means that, for example, Hulk and Black Widow have very similar stats. The upside is that you can pick favorites without any reservations. I still stayed well away from anyone without a healing function, however.Everyone has a wide variety of moves they can use, but there are also some (enormous sigh) RPG elements to digest. This rears its head in the form of loot and level grinds, which both feel rather bloated. The gear you acquire does nothing to distinguish itself, though it makes for a comprehensive Arrow Comparison Engine. If you’re very into min-maxing, you can get downright granular about who’s equipped with what. Excess gear can even be dismantled for resources, which pairs nicely with your tiny inventory space. The level grind is top tier terrible, for several reasons.Every character comes with their own Challenge Card. This is leveled up along with the actual character, using a different set of points and experience. While you don’t have to max out their Challenge Card, you gain enough points from doing so to afford a set of character DLC – whenever that starts coming out. Aside from new characters, most of what you have to grind for is cosmetic gear. If there’s amazing high-level gear to work towards, I haven’t encountered it yet. In other words, you’ll be cycling through a finite number of missions an infinite number of times, all to eventually get more characters and costumes. As someone whose grind-based satisfaction comes from cool-ass loot, this sounds awful. Finally, there are microtransactions to navigate. But these are only monetary shortcuts for those characters and costumes you don’t want to grind for. And since grinding for those things constitutes the whole post-game experience, you don’t need to indulge. In fact, you absolutely shouldn’t.On the subject of bad times, I feel obligated to mention that certain elements are presently in need of patching. Pop-in occurs from time to time, small animations fall out of sync, and there are some framerate issues. I am playing the game on a regular PS4, which might explain why things got so choppy towards the final mission. I’m hesitant to let these minor technical troubles impact the final score, but they need to be pointed out. If you’re sensitive to such things, maybe give this one a patch or two before picking it up.While the superhero genre is loaded with expectations, I had none before picking up Marvel’s Avengers. I’ve seen every movie, but I haven’t read an actual comic book since the 90’s. Even so, my final judgment hinges on that multiplayer experience, which I’ve so far gotten very little of. All signs so far point to a long, grueling slog of a post-game, but I could still be surprised. At least the campaign is a bouncy romp, assuming you find the difficulty setting you’re comfortable with. There’s a healthy mix of gameplay spread between every character, so you’re never too inundated with someone you’ve just discovered is the worst. The game shoehorned in a couple of stealth sections for some reason, but they were quite brief. Fights are a joyous cavalcade of special effects and flying bodies almost 80% of the time. Although my ultimate verdict is weeks of multiplayer away, the first slice of this cake is a tasty one. Even casual Marvel fans would do well to keep Marvel’s Avengers on their radar.***A PlayStation code was provided by Square Enix*** Developer: Crystal Dynamics, Eidos MontrealPublisher: Square Enix"
Marvel's Avengers,Eric Hauter,PlayStation Universe,https://www.psu.com/reviews/marvels-avengers-ps4-review/," Eric Hauter / September 5, 2020Marvel’s Avengers PS4 Review – Marvel’s Avengers is a much better game than anyone was expecting. Much of the early word on the game was negative – from last year’s E3 reports of “floaty” combat, to hot takes from the recent betas yammering about the game not having enough structure or variety. Until reviewers finally got their hands on Avengers (on the same day as the folks that purchased the Deluxe Edition), the gaming community seemed poised for an Anthem-style pile on. If I am being honest, I was still hoping for the best, but my expectations for Marvel’s Avengers were quite low.But to give the community credit, the zeitgeist on this game turned around very quickly – within hours of the first folks taking a swing at it. Give gamers a good game, and we react in kind. I’m happy to see the gaming press eat a little humble pie if that means I can report that Marvel’s Avengers is actually very fun – with a great single-player campaign and some serviceable (if somewhat confusing) endgame content. Folks, we have a winner here, and it makes me excited to see where Crystal Dynamics can take the Avengers in the future.Perhaps the most brilliant move the creators of Marvel’s Avengers made was to put relative comic book newcomer Kamala Khan front and center. Seeing the events of this game through her eyes gives Marvel’s Avengers a freshness and optimism that I simply was not expecting from my time with the beta. Kamala brings out the fan in all of us, and her shameless love of the Avengers makes it feel okay to put your jaded opinions aside and simply geek out on spending time with these characters.The opening act of the game – which I won’t spoil here – is utter brilliance, introducing us to our main characters in a way that at once humanizes them and convinces the player to set aside their MCU prejudices concerning the character design. The folks making this game have captured the spirit of these long-time characters, and comic book fans – who endure artist changes all the time – understand that the faces and costumes don’t matter, it’s the essence under the surface that counts. This game knows the souls of the Avengers and the moment that realization dawns on the player is early and powerful.Before long, the events depicted in the beta take place. An earth-shattering accident occurs (seemingly the fault of the Avengers), killing thousands and converting many others into Inhumans, newly minted superhumans that may or may not have control over their powers. The Avengers are disbanded in disgrace. In the panicked public discourse that follows, the Inhumans are declared to be menaces to society. A powerful new organization – Advanced Idea Mechanics – rises up to help gather the new superhumans and contain them. Spoiler – AIM is an organization of authoritarian turds.Kamala Khan has become an Inhuman and is secretly working behind the scenes with dreams of eventually joining a mysterious rebellion to resist AIM. One thing leads to another, and she realizes that she must re-assemble the Avengers to fight AIM and affirm the rights of Inhumans to not be persecuted and killed. The rest of the game follows Kamala as she tracks down the Avengers one by one, infecting them with her optimism and sense of responsibility, and bringing them back into the fold. This is a great hook for the game, allowing for some serious twists and fun reveals.The performances – Kamala’s in particular – are rock solid. Tony’s breezy jokes that cover up his insecurities with bravado, Bruce’s quiet brilliance, guilt, and wit, Cap’s stoic heroism, the way that none of the other Avengers touches Natasha – ever. All of that is baked into the DNA of the game. But Kamala is the standout character here – an instant star standing out in this group of luminaries. Her geeky enthusiasm is utterly infectious, earning her a spot in the top tier of Marvel characters for fans less familiar with her comic exploits.The player spends time playing as each of the heroes, often in spectacular set-pieces rivalling anything in the feature films. The intro that players received to each character in the beta was just the tip of the iceberg – there are far deeper training sessions built into the structure of the game. Each character plays in a unique way while using similar enough controls to keep the player from being completely overwhelmed. Tony flies, Black Widow shoots, the Hulk hulks, and all of this is done in an intuitive enough way that the player never feels befuddled by the control scheme.Of course, the deeper the player gets into the game, the more the character paths diverge. Each character has an enormous skill tree – most of which you won’t even touch during the campaign. Characters earn XP under the hood while you play, typically receiving a skill point or two to invest after each mission. Skills unlock new moves – or power up old ones – which in turn unlock new strategies for each character. I’ve been focusing on Hulk in the endgame, and his move set is now so far beyond what he started with that I haven’t done a basic combo in ages.Layered on top of all of this is Marvel’s Avengers loot system. Each character has four basic loot slots to fill. During the campaign, it is usually safe enough to simply press the “equip best loot” button and break everything else down for resources. But by the time you venture into the post-campaign content, you will need to start paying more attention to what you are keeping and getting rid of. Each piece of loot can be levelled up individually by spending the various materials you find all over the place, meaning that valuable gear can stay valuable for more than a few levels – if you want to invest in it.Marvel’s Avengers endgame content mostly consists of a loot grind, but a fun one. Finishing the campaign is a bit overwhelming, as the postgame unlocks to reveal a confusing sprawl. Figuring out what to do next can be a bit of a chore, as the player instantly realizes that they are severely underpowered for much of the content available. The campaign makes you feel powerful. The endgame reveals that you are not.Much of the problem I had with the endgame centred on the very weird UI the player navigates to select new missions. Activities are ostensibly selected on the Avengers holographic war table, but quest lines are tracked elsewhere in the character UI. This led to me selecting activities and questlines that I wanted to pursue in the character UI and then having no idea how to find them on the war table.But once I got it all figured out, the game began to flow again for me nicely. I settled into the power grind, enjoying jumping into missions with friends and random other players. Most of the endgame missions are fairly same-y, but there is plenty of room for this aspect of the game to expand. There are five or six basic mission types which you will encounter pretty quickly. But running these missions is still fun, and of course, playing superhero with friends is a blast. The game scales encounters so the weakest team member is viable, which makes higher-level characters feel truly super.Though there is some variety in daily supervillain hunts and a few story missions after the campaign, I would love to see further storylines expand past the AIM storyline and into other corners of the Marvel Universe. The five AIM outposts that you repeatedly raid will get old very quickly, so I’m hoping that we see the group venture to other locales as the game grows.There are a zillion different ways to expand and enhance your characters in Marvel’s Avengers, each carefully constructed to keep the player coming back for more. Beyond the faction grind and loot hunt, each character has a “Hero Challenge Card” to pursue. Think of Challenge Cards as Battle Passes. Each hero has daily and weekly quests they can pursue in order to unlock points – which in turn unlock tiers of cosmetic rewards on their Card. This is some slow-going stuff. By the time I finished the campaign, I had unlocked around two tiers on each hero’s card – out of forty.Hero Card rewards range from nameplate decals to full skins, but also include stuff like emotes and takedown animations. Cosmetic items of this sort can also be purchased from faction vendors, which is the primary reason to pick up daily faction quests.Of course, some skins and other cosmetics are only available as microtransaction purchases. But it is with relief that I can say that those skins and cosmetics are the ONLY things available as microtransaction purchases. There is zero nonsense hidden in Marvel Avenger’s business plan. No power enhancers, or XP boosters anywhere in sight. You pay your money, you get your Joe Fixit skin, simple as that. This is utterly unnecessary to enjoy the game and easily avoided.I think that it’s pretty clear that I’ve enjoyed my time with Marvel’s Avengers. But I don’t want to give the impression that there isn’t room for improvement. I ran into some pretty severe bugs and performance issues while playing the campaign (surprisingly less so during multiplayer).Interestingly, the game’s performance seemed to get worse the further into the story I got. About eight hours in, I started noticing framerate drops, particularly during dramatic cut scenes. An hour or two later, those framerate issues crept into the gameplay. Then, about an hour before the game’s finale, everything went entirely to crap in a whirlwind of malfunctions.I won’t bore you with the details, but this complete breakdown of Marvel’s Avengers functionality was impressive in its scope and variety. Big games have bugs, particularly at launch, but this was one of the most extended sequences of a game slowly breaking down that I’ve ever experienced. It was like watching a very, very slow train crash. Interestingly, when I was telling the story to my PSU colleagues, one of them reported having the exact same experience in the exact same spot. A hard reboot cleared things up, but still, wow.I’ve also had some problems wrestling the camera into giving me the angle that I want when it clearly has other ideas (try leaving the war table on the bridge of the Chimera and running upstairs; you’ll see what I mean). And I’m not super enthused about some of the platforming/wall running sections of the campaign, which seem designed to kill players over and over again just to make them sit through an extensive load screen.But let’s be real. Many online games are unplayable during the first week after launch, so by comparison, Avengers is in remarkably good shape. And none of this can distract from the fact that Marvel’s Avengers is one badass game. All of these issues can be quickly patched out, and the bottom line is that Marvel’s Avengers has good bones. A great deal of meat can be added to this structure, to the point where Avengers will eventually be a sprawling epic of a game. Hell, it already is pretty epic.I don’t have a “home” game that I return to over and over again. Some people play FIFA or NBA 2K. Some get deeply into Destiny or escape into Call of Duty every year. I bounce from game to game, finishing the campaign, doodling with multiplayer, and moving on. I believe that with Marvel’s Avengers, I have found my game. This game will move to PS5 with me, and continue to grow in the years to come, and I am here for it. I can hulk, and hulk, and hulk some more. The feeling of screaming and smashing stuff is absolutely glorious. Marvel’s Avengers is a keeper.Marvel’s Avengers is now available on the PlayStation Store and at retailers everywhere.Review code kindly supplied by the publisher.With a stellar campaign and set pieces that rival anything in the MCU, Marvel’s Avengers already delivers a ton of value. But add on the endless multiplayer and future characters, and this game is poised to be a classic. Some early bugs distract from the fun, but the bones of the game are solid. Marvel’s Avengers is an amazing achievement.

Marvel's Avengers,Andrew Farrell,PC Invasion,https://www.pcinvasion.com/marvels-avengers-review-we-could-be-heroes/,"A fair number of games nowadays want to be a live service. Keep the players coming back with cosmetics and new content from time to time and there’s a lot of money to be made. While I don’t care much for that way of doing things, few licenses are a better fit for it than Marvel. It’s easy to be skeptical of another live service game that’s carefully designed to separate fans from their money, but Marvel’s Avengers is a good game all on its own. With the promise of years of support and new heroes and missions being added at regular intervals, it’s hard for me to not be at least a little excited by the prospects of seeing the game grow.Unless you’ve been living under some kind of magic rock, you know what Marvel’s Avengers is about solely from reading the title. You play as Earth’s mightiest heroes as they battle evil with all sorts of awesome powers and tools. Specifically, the game is set in a separate continuity from the comics and movies. It concerns the fallout of the famous Terrigen gas release that created the Inhumans. The Avengers are blamed and go their separate ways, only for a young Inhuman by the name of Kamala Khan to be spurred into action to try to get the band back together.It’s a very typical plot, but the writing, acting, and cutscenes are so enjoyable that I didn’t even care. The campaign is extremely well put together with a lot of clear reverence for the source material and characters. Stark is as humorously smug as always, Bruce Banner’s conflicted nature is effective, and Kamala’s earnestness and self-reflection root the story in a surprising amount of pathos that helps make it an excellent Avengers tale. Even if you don’t care for all the gear and skill points, there’s still plenty here to enjoy for Marvel fans.The campaign of Marvel’s Avengers plays out in a mostly standard way. It’s a linear set of 19 main missions broken up by optional side missions focusing on specific characters and routine missions that you can play for experience and loot. That being said, there’s an impressive amount of variety to the campaign. You mostly just beat dudes and robots to death, but there are plenty of platforming sections and some mighty impressive set pieces here and there. You’ll even see a stealth section or two, plus there’s always exploring the Chimera (the Avengers’ helicarrier) between missions.The story in Marvel’s Avengers isn’t especially long, but there’s a good amount of stuff to keep you busy before you jump into the post-story mode. Campaign missions are typically focused on narrative, while the others are in line with what you’ll see in games like Warframe and Destiny. Typically, you’re either dropped directly at a facility where you’ll fight your way to a room where you’ll need to hold points to build up a meter before your enemies do, dispatch certain enemies, or destroy specific objects.It’s all simple, yet effective. There are several areas where these missions can take place and they offer wide outdoor spaces that are fun to stretch your legs in (sometimes literally.) There’s a metropolitan city area, the tundra, a lush forest, canyons, and the like. The environments are typically gorgeous, with great use of textures and foliage. Cutscenes, characters, and their animations are similarly effective. Marvel’s Avengers is a AAA game after all, and it certainly looks the part. At any time you can use a spatial awareness feature to check for nearby points of interest which often include gear chests, strong enemies, and you can even find your way to hidden vaults.None of this would mean much if the combat wasn’t any good, but Marvel’s Avengers is a lot of fun, even if it keeps things mostly simple. I was hoping for it to be a full ARPG, but it only really goes half-way. Each character has light and heavy strikes that can be mixed together, sometimes to form their own special combos. Holding the attack buttons generally offers different moves as well. Holding the heavy attack for most characters charges up an even stronger heavy strike that typically breaks an enemy’s guard. Characters can also dodge and even fly if they’ve got the capability to do so.The ARPG mechanics are more on display with character abilities. Everyone has three and they’re typically very handy when it comes to turning the tides of a tough fight. However, they’re less like typical ARPG skills and more like supers, similar to how character abilities work in Warframe. You’re not going to be constantly cycling between them, much to my chagrin. They naturally vary in usefulness from character-to-character. There are also specific abilities that make use of a meter, and these vary wildly too. Hulk’s makes use of his rage, which does extra damage and heals him, while Ms. Marvel makes herself larger and stronger. Iron Man’s is used as a stun parry that immobilizes foes. The characters play very differently in a lot of respects like this.The enemies are all guys and robots and the latter break apart in amusing ways. Enemies can be fairly tough too, as I found myself dying more than expected during solo campaign missions. Although Marvel’s Avengers feels and plays a lot like a beat-em-up at times, you do need to pay attention and especially watch out for ranged enemies who are more than happy to consistently take potshots at you. Whenever a hero runs out of health, their team members can revive them simply by standing close by. You can have three AI companions with you if you want, but playing with other people is obviously very much encouraged, as your AI teammates don’t really focus on objectives much at all.There’s also tons of loot, as you’d imagine. Each character has four main slots that equipment can be placed in. Everything can affect damage, defense, and abilities, plus they often have bonuses. As characters level up, they earn skill points that can earn them new moves and are used to further improve various statistics and whatnot. You can also get components from boxes and dismantling unneeded gear that you can use to buy new gear or cosmetics from vendors. You can supplement all of this by doing a faction’s daily quests to try and keep yourself flush.As for the PC port, Marvel’s Avengers is a bit of a mixed bag. I played it on an AMD GPU and had a surprising amount of problems. I’ve had crashes during cutscenes, after completing missions, and my entire PC got crashed once just from clicking play in the launcher. One of the most persistently annoying issues I’ve had is that the video will stop moving during cutscenes while the audio continues for a bit before the whole thing freezes. This usually results in me waiting half a minute or more for the game to right itself. Early on, I had some stuttering as well, which somehow resolved itself despite the fact that I didn’t see a patch. My colleague on an Nvidia GPU had hardly any trouble outside of occasional frame drops, however.As for the game, though, it’s just getting started. New heroes and missions are already set to start pouring in soon and I’m looking forward to trying them all out while continuing to level up the six that are already included. Anyone looking to stomp some enemies and collect loot with Marvel heroes will find a lot to like here already. At its core, Marvel’s Avengers is a fun, flashy time that will likely do very well. They better add Wolverine at some point, though.Marvel's Avengers is a very entertaining game that makes great use of its characters. The PC version gave me some problems and many others are having similar issues, but it's an enjoyable time with a lot of value.About Us

Marvel’s Avengers is a game at war with itself. From the moment you drop into the game’s main menu, you’re presented with two main options: Campaign and Avengers Initiative. Campaign is where you’ll get the cutscene-fueled and setpiece-filled Avengers main storyline, featuring Kamala Khan aka Ms. Marvel reuniting the Avengers to take on the threat the AIM poses to society. Avengers Initiative is the loot-centered multiplayer mode, focused on grinding up character levels and replaying a variety of missions in order to turn your post-campaign team of superheroes into an all-powerful squad that can take on any challenge. Yet it’s weird to me that these options are separated when they are the same game.There are numerous examples of loot games both good and bad, ongoing and evolving online experiences designed around repeatable gameplay loops that have had their share of growing pains. The Destiny franchise has been a rollercoaster ride of potential, The Division famously made a military third-person shooter into a Diablo-like loot-based co-op game, and BioWare’s Anthem is perhaps one of the highest profile failures for a game in this category. Marvel’s Avengers evokes the three of these games and more, for better and worse. But as Kamala Khan’s father tells her, “Good isn’t a thing you are, it’s a thing you do.”The Marvel’s Avengers campaign weaves its story somewhat awkwardly with the loot-based gameplay, but its 10 hours or so are thrilling. Focusing on Kamala as an Avengers superfan who becomes one of them is the ultimate player fantasy. She is quite literally us, a vehicle for the player where we don’t have to cast aside disbelief to become a billionaire genius, super spy, or literal god from another realm. That process of onboarding casts this superheroic team in a whole new light as she gathers the battered and broken team back together. Her comments during fights about how cool it is to be fighting with the Avengers is just what all of us want to be saying. It balances a level of cheesiness that could have been and manages to be quite endearing instead.It’s also great to see a character like Kamala front and center in the story. Her Muslim roots aren’t shuffled to the side either, becoming a key part of her costume design and mentioned multiple times in conversations with other Avengers. And yet it also never felt like Crystal Dynamics was just trying to check a box. Who Kamala is became a natural part of the Marvel’s Avengers story in a way that’s quite rare for games to balance so well these days.﻿Exciting setpieces accent critical parts of the campaign, and the game world evolves around you to show the progress you are making. From the main menu adding to the roster of heroes you bring together (and showing what cosmetics you’ve customized them with) to the main base of operations going from flightless to fully functional Helicarrier, it seems to be a small glimpse into the way Avengers wants to grow. The story isn’t particularly surprising or full of unexpected twists. One main beat is pretty obvious if you know what you are looking for—though arguably done in a way that did end up surprising me at least a little.The campaign acts a bit as a “tour of heroes,” as well as an introduction to many of Marvel’s Avengers’ main concepts, though some heroes play a much more main role while others don’t get much attention in the main story at all (looking at you Thor). The story does continue post-campaign though, with iconic mission chains specific to each hero and another  set of storylines that starts setting up the world of Avengers to be, but these missions focus much less on overt story via cutscenes and setpieces, instead tasking players with starting to engage with the long-term aspects of the game in a bigger way.Though Marvel’s Avengers came out about two weeks ago, this is a game meant to last for the long term. We wanted to give it ample time to settle in before coming to a “final” verdict, or as final as any verdict can be for a game that will be different just months from now. And that meant really engaging with the endgame loop, loot grind, and myriad systems that Marvel’s Avengers has in place.In the campaign, Avengers is something of a typical brawler. Each character feels moderately different, but for the most part they have largely the same abilities based on light, heavy, and ranged attacks, with support and assault-centered special moves and a super attack, each on a cooldown. Post-campaign, however, these characters really start to come into their own as you level them up and fully unlock each of their kits. Every five to ten levels makes the character feel fundamentally different to play as, ramping up their capabilities and providing options for players to tailor each of their play styles. By the time you hit level 50, you’ll barely recognize the character, so different are they to the underleveled heroes we used in the campaign. It’s this process of hitting 50 and spending a good amount of time with each Avenger that makes them feel unique, empowering the fantasy that each specific hero entails. It’s an element poorly communicated up front.Then comes grinding for gear and building your Power level, something I am all too familiar with from games like Destiny 2 and The Division 2. The biggest issue withe Marvel’s Avengers for me so far is that loot has yet to feel really special. There’s no gear that stands out to me as a must-have piece. Despite appearing on your character as a holographic image on the equip screen, none of the loot actually makes any difference at all to each character’s aesthetics, something that’s a huge draw for other loot based games. I understand this limitation may have come from Marvel. Cosmetics are relegated to full outfit changes that can be unlocked, purchased, and equipped. But it makes loot feel largely meaningless without a visual reflection of the gear you are earning. I’m not sure what the optimal solution looks like here; how to combine the current outfit based cosmetic system and make loot have a visual impact, but I think Crystal Dynamics needs to provide a bigger incentive for people to grind for cool stuff rather than just to make the numbers go up.The other issue is that Marvel’s Avengers is currently lacking any kind of true endgame challenge for players to even gear up for. It’s missing the equivalent of Destiny or The Division 2’s Raids. Its current set of mission offerings is a smattering of disorganized nodes on a world map that probably mean nothing to the average player. Each of these loads you into samey environments without the notable setpieces from the story to brawl against a bunch of AIM baddies. Objectives here and there may change, but I really wish these felt less like procedurally generated forests and generic high-tech facilities and more like curated experiences. The overall endgame loop is fun enough, but the “why” of it all has yet to present itself.To be fair, The Division didn’t start out with Raids (and its first one was a bad grind against a bullet-sponge boss) and Destiny was initially a letdown for a lot of players before the Vault of Glass Raid opened up a world of possibilities for the franchise, but Marvel’s Avengers needs to lean into its longterm loot-based plans and start defining the challenges that players will undertake. The alternative is what we saw happen to Anthem, which lacked any real kind of endgame challenge or chase for players to enjoy. New characters, story, and locations being added down the line is great, but you have to give players a reason and a place to use these characters at their full power in a way that challenges everything they’ve learned and grinded gear for. Perhaps that’s coming, but it’s something the needs to be communicated soon.In fact, the entire post-campaign Avengers Initiative side of the game feels a little bit undercooked, a series of great concepts based on other loot-based games that makes it clear Crystal Dynamics has some lessons to learn. Games like The Division and Destiny have had years of growth and evolution and development. By comparison, it’s clear that Marvel’s Avengers is just starting out down this path. It’s a canvas of possibility, but the real test will be seeing what they end up doing with it. The community is already issuing tons of feedback about quality of life issues that need fixed. Crystal Dynamics has already addressed a number of them through updates since the launch of the game. And there is at least a future roadmap of support in place, right now focused primarily on adding characters with new story missions and locations.What really saves the whole thing is that Marvel’s Avengers is so much damn fun to play. Yes, I smirk and sigh a little as I descend into yet another mapping of high-tech hallways that mirrors the last mission I played. And sure, I’m getting tired of seeing the same forested areas that hide another AIM facility, but I forget all about that when I call in the lightning as Thor, wallop enemies with giant fists as Kamala, or chuck enormous chunks of the ground as Hulk. Again, particularly as these characters level up, the game arguably gets immensely more fun to play even as there’s less to actually do and see.Monetization is also present in Marvel’s Avengers, but it hardly feels like a focus at all. Yeah, there’s a marketplace of cool stuff you can buy for real money, including emotes, nameplates, outfits, and finishers, but it’s presence feels firmly relagated to the background. You almost need to actively seek it out in order to find it. This comes along with individual heroes’ battle-pass-like challenge cards, which can be finished by completing challenges or paying money, offering a series of hero-specific cosmetics, but again, the whole system feels supplementary in total. It’s never in your face, and if you want to ignore the whole monetization and cosmetics side of Marvel’s Avengers, you easily can. Which is probably a good thing, given how expensive some of the hero outfits are.One of the biggest things I can’t help but wonder about as I play on PS4 is what the PS5 version will offer in comparison. It feels a bit like the current generation of consoles also holds Marvel’s Avengers back, to some extent. I’m certain Marvel wanted a broad install base here, but the game could have really benefited from another delay to launch alongside next-gen consoles. Playing on a standard launch PS4, I’ve encountered numerous performance issues and bugs, though consensus among the community seems to indicate it’s not just limited to playing on a launch PS4. I’m extremely curious to know how the next-gen version of the game will perform. And remembering that we’re just two weeks into a game meant for the long haul, I’m curious what Marvel’s Avengers will look like by next-gen launch, by six months out, or by this time next year.For all of my criticisms, Marvel’s Avengers is still a game I can’t wait to get back to playing. While there’s a lot of work to do, it gets one main thing right: it’s fun to be an Avenger. Crystal Dynamics captured this incredible feeling of being a superhero and distilled it into a digital environment. Combat is deep and nuanced, with far more complexities and character than your traditional superhero brawler. Right now, Marvel’s Avengers is a bit rough around the edges, but “good isn’t a thing you are. It’s a thing you do.” If Crystal Dynamics can smooth performance and squash bugs, as well as build out a more compelling endgame experience, it has a lot of potential to be one of the most memorable and replayable loot brawlers of this generation and next.Marvel’s Avengers review code provided by publisher.

Home » Reviews » Marvel’s Avengers Review – Part AssembledMarvel’s Avengers caught me by surprise for two reasons. First, how in the heck has it taken this long for a ‘true’ Avengers game to come to market? And second, how did it end up like this? Marvel’s Avengers is a game of two halves, and neither are anything special.The Avengers have always been about kicking bad guy ass, together. In that sense, the ‘Avengers Initiative’ aspect of the game should be what resonates with fans most. It gives players a rotating selection of missions to take on alongside friends, as one of six Avengers (including Kamala Khan). To reach this, though, the game advises you to play through the campaign first. Not just because it acts as a nice tutorial, but because Avengers Initiative contains spoilers for the campaign story. So, like I assume most other players did, I hopped into the campaign first.The campaign follows the story of Kamala Khan (Ms. Marvel) during her teenage years. She’s full of pep and has a contagiously feel-good demeanor to her, owed in no small part to the exceptional voice casting and delivery of the cliched dialogue. Across the board, the voice acting is exceptional, with the likes of Troy Baker coming in to give Bruce Banner’s lines a witty, intellectual feel. The actual dialog could have been a little less corny, but this is a Marvel game after all, so it all kinda fits with the source material.In terms of the storyline itself, again it’s got its highs and lows. Following the events of A-Day, which saw the Avengers blamed for a terrorist attack that wasn’t their doing, Kamala embarks on a quest to get the Avengers back together, clear their names, and put an end to the mysterious and villainous AIM organization. It’s got twists and turns, but none of them will ever truly catch you off guard. In the words of Kamala Khan, ‘good isn’t a thing you are, it’s a thing you do,’ and unfortunately, Marvel’s Avengers doesn’t actually do anything all that well. Despite a strong story and voice acting, when it comes to the gameplay and general performance, that’s where things start to really go downhill.Gameplay largely focuses on controlling Kamala (or another Avenger) as you progress through a series of frequently re-used levels, button-mashing your way through hordes of enemies. You clear a bunch, pick up any loot, push on and rinse repeat. You may sometimes have objectives such as protecting civilians or Inhumans or preventing AIM bots from accessing terminals while Jarvis is doing his own hacking, but it all ends more or less the same way.The same enemy types are reused time and time again, the ‘vault’ move (to get around the back of and expose shielded enemies) and parry systems seemingly decided when they wanted to work — more often than not they didn’t — and sadly some of the most anticipated heroes to play as… just aren’t that fun to play.This is particularly true of Thor and Iron Man, whose aerial controls just feel cumbersome. Trying to fly around the combat ensuing below while firing off repulsor blasts or hurling your hammer into someone’s face just doesn’t feel natural, and quite frankly proves to be pretty tricky. The roster woes don’t end with Stark and the God of Thunder, either. Black Widow, despite being one of the more enjoyable, fast-paced melee characters, has underwhelming special abilities (which recharge over time). The Hulk feels clunky, though admittedly is great fun to go smashing stuff with, and Cap falls into the same category as Black Widow more or less.That’s not to say that none of them are enjoyable to play as at all. Some fun can be had once you invest time and plenty of skill points into one superhero. Time spent getting to grips with the nuances of their combat style and abilities. Kamala Khan stood out to me as the most enjoyable character. She has a handy healing ability, ‘High-Five’ sees her arm stretching out to swat enemies in the face, and her ultimate sees her super-stretchy body grow in size, increasing damage and health temporarily as a result.As my time with the campaign came to a close, it threw in a seemingly pointless StarkTech Outfits mission that’s simply a fetch quest for resources obtained by defeating certain enemy types. The enemies are neither difficult to find nor defeat, but the fact this first instance is thrown in literally a matter of missions from the end of the game, it feels like nothing more than a desperate attempt to pad out the campaign’s duration.It’s in a similar way to the side content in the campaign, too. Simply put, these are uninspired rehashes of the same missions you’ve been completing as part of the main story questline. The exceptions to these are the ‘Iconic Missions.’ Each member of the Avengers has their own series of Iconic Missions to complete, and tend to be far more enjoyable and intriguing in narrative than the rest of the bland side mission offering.Then we reach endgame, and boy is Avengers feeling weak on that front. Once the campaign’s wrapped up, the Avengers Initiative kicks in, and it feels like barely anything changes. You’ve no longer got story missions to complete, but instead have to plod through the monotonous missions types, dealing with the repetitive combat and reused environments. You can get some extra Icon Missions by leveling up each Hero Card, however, but be prepared for a serious grind. You can play them all the Avengers Initiative friends, which is at least a positive over the campaign, but there’s little new in terms of content to keep you excited and playing Marvel’s Avengers to grind your characters out to Hero Level 50 and 150 Power.For some, this grind will be a welcome challenge, but for others including myself, I just wasn’t enthused about pouring more time in.That’s arguably Marvel’s Avengers biggest problem. In a world where the likes of Destiny 2 and Borderlands 3 rule the roost of looter shooters with tight, compelling gunplay and an abundance of end game content, character customization and frequent content drops, Marvel’s Avengers falls short. The campaign’s got enough to warrant a purchase for Marvel fans, but the persistent game world doesn’t feel like it has the legs to run with the big boys just yet.That’s not because Crystal Dynamics have done a particularly bad job. In fact, Avengers feels incredibly close to something like Destiny 2 in terms of the various systems it has in place. The problem is, they’re just not quite as good. Take the feature that enables players to power-boost their Gear. This should, in theory, allow players to take Gear with preferred abilities and rolls and power it up to a level that allows you to use it in tougher missions.But depending on the rarity of the piece of Gear, you can only level it up a maximum of 10 times. The system works against itself here, and the message that ‘gear is valuable.’ It’s confusing, and this lack of explanation is prevalent throughout the game in many of its systems, including the in-depth team synergy mechanics that come as part of the multiplayer, if you’re willing to commit the time to it.Marring the entire experience, though, are the performance problems. Whether it’s a dire framerate on PS4 Pro, cutscenes completely glitching out, subtitles not matching up with the dialog at all — as if someone changed the voice work last minute and forgot to change the subtitles from the previous lines — and insufferable load times, you’ll find them in Marvel’s Avengers. Marvel’s Avengers left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I’m sure the campaign will be enough to keep some fans happy, but this was pushed as a Game as a Service (GAAS) that offers a persistent world with something to do. That may be the case, and I’m sure Crystal Dynamics will do a great job of releasing content down the line, but the core gameplay’s simply not good enough to make me want to play any more of it.If you’re looking for an Avengers campaign and nothing more, you may enjoy what Marvel’s Avengers has to offer, especially if the performance and be polished up with post-launch patches. But if you’re looking for another persistent world looter shooter, there are far, far better options out there right now. Marvel’s Avengers is only just starting its journey with plenty of content due to release in the future, but right now it’s a tough sell.Review BlockFairCopyright © 2022 GAMURS Group

Marvel's Avengers,Darryn Bonthuys,Critical Hit,https://www.criticalhit.net/gaming/marvels-avengers-review-aim-less-grinding/,"I’ve spent the last week smashing AIM murder-bots to powers with nothing more than tattered jeans and gamma-powered rage, I’ve knocked homicidal scientists out of the air with a magic hammer, and I’ve shrugged off laser beam blasts with patriotic skill honed on the tough streets of Brooklyn. Marvel’s Avengers has been an exhilarating experience when all the pieces come together, but it has also been a frustrating exercise in AAA gaming in its most unfocused state possible.Make no mistake, there’s a genuinely great game at the core of Marvel’s Avengers, one that should further pave the way for the video game multiverse that 2018’s Spider-Man started. At the same time, for every good idea that Marvel’s Avengers introduces to the genre of a superhero power fantasy, it’s also held back by parasitic live service elements.The recent open beta for the game didn’t do any favours, serving to only highlight these flaws that threaten to overshadow the game when it manages to be bloody brilliant. Marvel’s Avengers isn’t just a story about Earth’s mightiest mortals dealing with the consequences of their hubris when it leads to the calamity known as A-Day.It’s the origin story of one of the most beloved new characters in Marvel Comics, Kamala Khan AKA Miss Marvel. Crystal Dynamics knew that they’d have a main event player on their hands with the fan favourite character, and her story is what drives the narrative of Marvel’s Avengers. In her, players have the perfect point of view character, a hero whose idealism doesn’t veer into the realm of naivety as she learns that even the greatest of heroes, aren’t infallible.She’s adorably dorky, honest in her fandom and she’s an absolute blast to play as, using her Inhuman polymorphing powers to stretch out of danger and deliver a P-Klap that borders on legendary. And she’s not the only character you can play as! Thor is a heavyweight brawler with ranged options thanks to Mjolnir, Black Widow is Tomb Raider with unlimited ammo and insane aerial techniques, Iron Man is a glass cannon who strikes best when it’s from a distance, and the Hulk is a tank with power to spare provided that you get to grips with his more subtle skills.There’s also that one guy whose name rhymes with Acting Retina, who’s basically a hard-hitting pugilist with agile defensive options who would be right at home if he hopped into a Devil May Cry game. I can’t stress enough just how much fun the Avengers are to play as, especially when you spend time learning their tricks, finding the right combination for how to use their powers and growing them throughout the course of the game.I may have started with Iron Man, but I’m currently loving the heck out of the Hulk, as Bruce Banner’s alter-ego is more than just some dull pathetic ape in the eyes of the world. Being able to crack the very mantle of the planet, grab enemies and use them as a makeshift club as you ragdoll them into submission, never gets old.You can even play around with skill loadouts, pumping experience into skills that range from basic melee combos through to upgrades for your Intrinsic powers, further hone them in the specialisation sub-branch and go beyond that with the Masteries that each hero can take advantage of. With each hero having 50 levels of character to earn and skills to pump the fruits of your grinding labours into, there’s a lot to do in terms of focused busywork.And that right there, is where Avengers drops the hammer.When Marvel’s Avengers works, it absolutely slaps the bonnet of a SHIELD tank and tells you just how much fun you’ll fit into that baby. Skills you unlock don’t just return your hero to fighting fit form, they complement the rest of your team. When used correctly, they make for cinematic action sequences that feels like it was ripped straight out of the comic books and Marvel Cinematic Universe. You’re ripping AIM synthoids apart, protecting your team and adding to a flow of combat that is an absolute joy to take part in, in the rare instances when everything fits together.But those live service elements, those horrible and pervasive distractions that turn a fun romp into an unappealing jaunt across a mere handful of levels, just can’t be ignored. I can’t shake this feeling that developer Crystal Dynamics had a plan for a brilliant single-player campaign, that publisher Square Enix decided to toss out the window and shoehorn grinding elements in for the sake of longevity.On the one hand, you’ve got a story that hits the right notes for an Avengers tale, nailing the characters and their personality with a confident swagger and a humble appreciation for who these heroes are. There are moments of fist-pumping jubilance, especially at the end of the short ten hour campaign, that rivals the portals scene from Avengers: Endgame. Those moments in Marvel’s Avengers, when I’m controlling living gods, fighting iconic foes and watching all hell break loose around me, are some of the finest gaming experiences I’ve ever had.But getting to those moments is an absolute slog. If you’re not traipsing around an AIM base that is slightly different from the last one you explored, you’re being distracted by constant messages from JARVIS about some barely better loot being in another corner of the map. Heck, the loot in Marvel’s Avengers, the one element that should keep players invested, doesn’t even feel that interesting to pursue at all.Granted some of them do have great perks, but they’re rarer than an alternate universe that contains a Deadpool who isn’t annoying. The numbers on this gear feels superfluous at best, items for random body parts that exist purely because some sort of loot ‘n boot mechanic had to be shoved in, creating a hard barrier to several activities instead of organically allowing players to experience campaign missions and sidequests.Every mission eventually devolves into a button-mashing slog as well, because for all the great character design and abilities on offer, Marvel’s Avengers is a crapshow of awful encounters as well. Characters are easily staggered by trash mobs who’ll appear from nowhere to interrupt you in the middle of a combo, I can barely focus on one enemy at a time without some random AIM beekeeper shooting me with magic seeking rockets, and the game does a terrible job of communicating to you when you’re in trouble.I’m not against being swarmed by enemy forces so that there’s a challenge to enjoy, but all the hard work to invest time and effort into a character so that they’re ready for Inhuman-hunting murder machines is thrown out of the window when the screen devolves into a mess of particles, explosions and blurry action. Often, I genuinely have no idea what’s going on at any given time due to all the chaos.What should be a superhero wish fulfillment power fantasy is further undone by general sloppiness, at least on the base PS4 version that I’ve played. Certain elements take too long to load, the character menu screen is a godawful collection of submenus that could stand for Thanos to come in and snap his Infinity Gauntlet fingers to reduce it by 50% and leave it perfectly balanced.The cribbing of Destiny 2’s homework is just obscene, you’re besieged by unhelpful tips and told to go do a character tutorial after you’ve spent two hours with them. I’ve attempted to lift Thor’s hammer in his room with the other characters and watched them struggle to pick up air as Mjolnir activates a cloaking spell, I’ve had to restart missions because apparently the AIM synthoid I just punched must have pissed off the Molecule Man in a previous life and has now been merged with a nearby wall.On my PS4, the game drops frames into the singles region when the action gets too hot and stutters like King George VI before he gives a speech to Britain. Above all that, Marvel’s Avengers just feels average in the moments between the main campaign, a soulless example of live service gaming that will be a testament to how chasing a bandwagon is never a good idea.I’m not even certain what the endgame is here, or why people will care once the first-week FOMO has faded away. And yet, I’m still holding out hope that Crystal Dynamics can salvage this game. It’s far from the mess that Fallout 76, No Man’s Sky, and Anthem were at launch, and like at least two of those examples, I want to see the Tomb Raider developer build more on this platform and be left to their own devices.Last Updated: September 9, 2020

The Beta was as dull as Hawkeye’s wife’s dish water. I jumped back into Spider-Man just get the taste of this Destiny poser out of my mouth. Such a awesome game. You actually feel like a superhero on that.

Guess I must be one of the few that’s loving the game and only problem I really have is the camera spin bug which I hope they patch soon. Don’t get me wrong there are a few other annoying bugs but they don’t happen as often as the camera spin.
Darryn how far are you on the campaign completion? After the SP campaign is finished at 56% there’s still a ton to do with MP campaign missions. Busy with Sage focusing on them and the iconic hero missions.

I am actually really enjoying the game myself. Still way in the beginning but this thing runs like a dream on my pc. But I guess each to his/her own.

Marvel's Avengers,Justin Clark,Slant Magazine,https://www.slantmagazine.com/games/review-marvels-avengers-forces-you-to-run-the-games-as-a-service-hamster-wheel/,"Everything truly good in Marvel’s Avengers is compromised by its mercenary feature set.With Marvel’s Avengers, Crystal Dynamics has managed to do what many reviews, screeds from established film directors, and anti-mainstream voices couldn’t: They’ve made me question my devotion to the titular superheroes. Namely, whether there really is nothing more to the latter-day iteration of the Avengers than fighting robots in between spouting Whedonesque dialogue. But, then, all it took was an afternoon of revisiting how they’ve been portrayed in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, comic books, and beyond across the last decade or so to see that Marvel’s Avengers alone does a disservice to the legacy of its superhero characters by making it seem as if they’re saving the world with empty promise.While the characters here largely take their visual cues and personalities from their portrayals in the MCU, you won’t know them from their faces, voices, and histories. That isn’t a problem in and of itself, except that Marvel’s Avengers doesn’t do the legwork of endearing them to us. And because they feel like strangers, it’s impossible to buy into the way they’re put at odds with one another after Captain America meets his demise and S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Avengers are blamed for the cosmic explosion that killed him, as well as the mutations that occurred in many of those who were in the blast’s range. Much of the game involves trying to put the band back together to stop the evil A.I.M. corporation from capitalizing on the world’s new state of chaos.The bones of a good, old-fashioned, linear action game are evident here. Brawling is a straightforward affair, with each Avenger’s special powers mapped to the shoulder buttons. Traversal feels right, with every superhero having their own snazzy method of getting around, from swinging on wires to clinging to and bouncing off walls; characters like Iron Man and Thor can even fly around the battlefield at will. Pity, then, that the battlefields often get too chaotic for their own good, choked with explosions, lasers, and exploding machine parts. The camera is sometimes a source of struggle. Level designs are bland, generic industrial wastelands surrounded by empty wilderness, and many of your objectives for each level have no sense of urgency. Worst of all, the game’s obscenely long load times make retrying a stage feel extra aggravating.Crafting a sturdy Avengers beat ‘em up, a modern-day spiritual successor to the classic Captain America and the Avengers arcade game from the early ’90s, is a noble aim. Which is to say, the aforementioned flaws aren’t a deal breaker, except that Marvel’s Avengers doesn’t make its stages feel vital to its story, nor does it deliver truly memorable high-stakes surprises or introduce creative or well-known foes into the mix. Had it delivered on all those fronts, the game wouldn’t have been too far removed from the breezy, top-down action titles in the Marvel Ultimate Alliance series. And if Marvel’s Avengers doesn’t, it’s because it’s too beholden, a la Destiny, to a live-service model—more interested in ensnaring than entertaining the player.The core gameplay mechanic of Marvel’s Avengers doesn’t hinge on making players feel the exhilaration of saving the world, but on the allure of amassing stuff. The only real way to proceed in the game is by constantly collecting more and better gear for each character, upgrading their stats, and adding to a preposterous list of currencies, resources, and random junk that you need to, yes, keep upgrading. And all of that is worse here than it is in Destiny, because at least the new items that you collect in that game can change the parts of a character’s costume or the way a weapon fires; even a basic mission nets quite a bit in rewards. By contrast, none of the gear you collect in Marvel’s Avengers even changes the way a character looks. The only way to do that is to grind through stages and complete a character’s challenge card, and if you rightfully start to feel the snail’s pace of your progress, you can always just buy the cosmetics with real world money.When the game, on its normal difficulty, starts to ramp up to the point where three hits from an enemy decimates your lifebar, there are no patterns to learn or strategies to change. What you feel instead of determination is the urgency of having to find another mission to take on and grind for better numbers, and the motivations aren’t strong enough to justify repetitive tasks for paltry rewards. Yes, there’s the base gratification of watching those numbers tick up, but with little else going on between its ears, Marvel’s Avengers feels creatively bankrupt. And while this sort of monotonous grinding typically makes it easy to just loathe and ignore a game, there’s collateral damage involved in completely writing this one off: Kamala Khan.Kamala is already one of the best things to happen to Marvel Comics just by being who she is: a 16-year-old Pakistani Muslim female superhero whose ethnicity, culture, and religion aren’t played to inspire controversy or feed into easy stereotypes. And even then, those aspects aren’t the whole of who she is. At least, all those things don’t outweigh the fact that she’s also just a dorky superhero stan living out her wildest dreams after she gets super powers. Somehow, despite all the despicable trappings of games as a service, everything special about her in the comics has made it into this game. She’s the star here, the one who decides to bring the Avengers together again, who wrestles with the implications of what to do with her power. She believes, without question, that she has to use it to face down the various injustices around her. As opposed to almost every other major hero in the game, she doesn’t lack for nuance. The game makes room for a moment in which she implements a burkini into her superhero outfit, as well as foregrounds her pride in knowing that she belongs with the Avengers, while also not ignoring that she’s still a kid who makes huge tactical mistakes.Kamala is this game’s heart and soul, joyfully written and lovingly and enthusiastically performed by Sandra Saad. Much of the story centers on her presence and actions, and even as a playable character, her polymorph powers are by far the most blissfully fun mechanics in the game. As such, it’s easy to imagine what Marvel’s Avengers could’ve been completely about: the focused, straightforward story of a girl coming to grips with who she is, what she’s capable of, and where she fits among Earth’s Mightiest Heroes as she defies an evil corporation who wants people who look and act like her dead. That story is there in Marvel’s Avengers, but unfortunately it’s one that’s swept aside often and awkwardly by wheel-spinning missions that exist only to teach players how to run that import-free, gear-garnering games-as-a-service hamster wheel of missions, never reaching a place where your job is ever done. And the fact that players must suffer that to experience one of the best crafted characters in gaming this year makes Marvel’s Avengers all the more infuriating.There’s an oft-repeated mantra in Marvel’s Avengers that goes, “Good isn’t a thing you are; it’s a thing you do.” And it’s one that’s recited in a game where doing good largely means “smash more robots” and “open more glowy chests.” Everything truly good in Marvel’s Avengers is compromised by its mercenary feature set. Live-service engagement is ultimately its guiding principle, and that’s a principle that’s never been heroic.This game was reviewed using a retail copy purchased by the reviewer.Justin Clark is a gaming critic based out of Massachusetts.

Marvel's Avengers,Josh Harmon,EGM,https://egmnow.com/marvels-avengers-review/,"Fittingly enough, Marvel’s Avengers translates both the best and worst of comic books into game form.Though I’d never purport to be a diehard fan or expert, I’ve read comics on and off since I was a kid. I loved exploring the characters and worlds, mainlining the imagination of creators and artists from action-packed splash pages straight into my brain. Heroes weren’t just paragons of virtue, but complicated figures with surprising depth and emotion.But the thing that ultimately kept me from converting into a Real Comics Person™ was the nagging sense that I wasn’t actually reading stories in the traditional sense. Stories end. Comic book stories, by virtue of the medium and the business, continue on forever, layering more and more complexity, stretching and distorting characters and ideas past their limits until the inevitable cancellation or continuity reboot.When you first boot into Marvel’s Avengers, you’re firmly in the territory of that first part, all the stuff I love about comics. The campaign, which offers a surprisingly meaty experience, focuses on a simple, usually well-told story with a real human core. After an apocalyptic incident in San Francisco destroys the city and imbues average people who carry the Inhuman gene with superpowers, the government forces the Avengers to disband. Five years later, an Inhuman girl named Kamala Khan—soon to become Ms. Marvel—sets out to reassemble the Avengers to save the day from a new threat, a megacorporation called AIM that seeks to wipe the Inhumans off the face of the Earth.As you journey through the campaign, you get to meet and play as multiple heroes. There’s Kamala, with her power to stretch and enlarge her body, along with the familiar lineup that I’ll assume needs no introduction: Thor, Captain America, Iron Man, Hulk, and Black Widow. Each hero each feels both distinct and, for the most part, true to their abilities from the comics and movies. In both writing and gameplay, the goofy, optimistic Kamala is a definite standout. Iron Man, by contrast, is a bit of a letdown. But they’re all decent, and the mostly linear single-player levels make good use of each character’s combat design to build engaging encounters with a few memorable moments. If this is all there was to the Marvel’s Avengers, you’d be reading a very different review.Are there issues, sure? The game is admittedly a little rough around the edges. It crashed probably a dozen times throughout my playthrough, and twice I was forced to restart from a checkpoint after enemies I had to defeat to progress spawned on the other side of a door where I couldn’t reach them. Once the game glitched out and started looping the same half-second of audio for a few minutes, after which everything was silent for the remainder of the mission. And the missions in the campaign can be a bit uneven—the more open, sandbox-style chapters feel like obvious filler, lacking the handcrafted care of the story’s bigger moments. In particular, they rely heavily on simple, repetitive objectives like standing in glowing shapes on the ground while a meter fills up. As I said in my earlier preview, these would be fine as game modes in a competitive multiplayer game. In single-player or co-op, however, they don’t really do much for me.But where Marvel’s Avengers truly falters is in aping the thing I hate about comics: This is a game that wants to go on forever. I’m talking, in case you haven’t been following the prelaunch coverage, about the games-as-a-service component, called Avengers Initiative, that you’re funneled into after beating the story. While there is some loose narrative backing—and even a few cutscenes—linking this material together, it’s mostly a matter of repeating the same missions over and over to level up your heroes and earn better gear. Unlike the campaign, all of this content is available to play in co-op, but given the focus on those sandbox levels, it’s also much less compelling.Being forced to replay content, in my case, made me actually realize how many underlying gameplay and design issues the campaign’s story razzle-dazzles into the background. For instance, if the game is designed around co-op, why is it so hard to strategize and communicate in these open levels? There’s no ping system like Apex Legends, and it’s hard to keep track of where other players are at any given moment. Even if you use a microphone, side objectives are only given question mark icons until you get very close, so you’re forced to organize your group by calling out the rough distance and direction of each objective you want to explore. In a linear game, you’d be able to get by. In a game with these open levels, it’s extremely half-baked design.Plus, the simple act of getting around the sandbox levels is universally dull and drawn out. You’re either leaping forward in tiny, decidedly un-super jumps—especially out of character for the Hulk—or you’re flying around absurdly slowly. There’s no fun in traversal, so it becomes dead space in gameplay, another thing to endure.Even the once-fun combat becomes a chore when you’re forced to do it so often. The lack of depth starts to grate, and at high levels success becomes much more about managing your abilities and cooldowns than it does actual twitch skill or reading your opponents. Given that gear is much more reliably rewarded from chests and completing missions than random drops from enemies, I eventually started just running past fights. On a transactional level, they weren’t worth the time or effort.After you’ve completed all the mission chains and watched the final cutscene, this repetitive grindwork is all there is to keep you invested. It’s what you’ve been working towards all this time. And the endgame underlying it is just simply not enjoyable enough to sustain itself long-term.I don’t want to get too far into the weeds here, but here’s the basic gist of progression: First, there’s an XP-based level progression, with skill points and ability tries. This is all fine and standard, and you never feel bogged down waiting for new things to unlock. On top of this, there’s a Power Level for each hero, determined by the gear you have equipped. For most of the game, you simply equip higher level gear as it drops randomly, in chests around the maps, or as rewards for completing missions. The gear levels appear to be randomized to be somewhere from slightly higher to slightly lower than what you’ve currently dropped. Plus, you can spend resources you’ve collected to bump up the power level up to 10 more times, with loot in higher rarity tiers offering more potential upgrades.All this changes, however, once you get to around level 130. No gear drops above that number, and any upgrade past 130 now requires a special resource called Upgrade Modules. While it’s frustrating that you literally need hundreds of Modules to fully upgrade all your gear, there are at least a few guaranteed ways to earn them. I actually found I could make progress quickly by starting a mission, racing over to a chest I knew had Modules, and then quitting out to restart. That’s obviously not the intent of the designers, but it smoothed out the grind enough that I was able to mindlessly chip away at a good pace.But once all your gear is at 140, things get worse still. The only way to actually get a hero to the max level cap of 150 is by upgrading one of the handful of Major Artifacts you’re awarded throughout the game. And to do that, you need an even rarer resource, Polychoron, which you can only get by finishing mission chains (which can’t be repeated for the same rewards, and will therefore eventually run out), or by accomplishing daily objectives handed out by the game’s two factions. These only refresh every 24 hours, so eventually you reach a hard cap in how much you’re allowed to earn—around 16 per day, as best as I can tell. To get my Major Artifact—and therefore my Kamala Khan, currently stuck at level 149—up to max level, I need 60 more Polychoron. That means it’ll take multiple days of waiting behind an artificial time gate to make the only real progress I still can with this hero.Even more annoying is the fact that, while any Major Artifact you unlock is shared between all heroes, the upgrades you give it are not. If I want to get another hero to 150, I’ll need to do this Polychoron grind all over again, time gates and all. In fact, it’ll take me much longer on future heroes, since I’ve already spent all the rewards from completing mission chains. Unless I’m missing something major, there’s no way to leverage progress on one hero or piece of gear to speed up the progress on another. Heck, if I decide I want to swap out a single, already leveled piece of gear, I’m going back to the Upgrade Module grind. I feel locked into choices I made days ago because it’s so inconvenient to try out anything new. I’ve actually earned a few Major Artifacts, but given the dozens and dozens of Polychoron I’ve already poured into the first one I unlocked, I’m too demoralized to start over. I’ll never actually know if they’re a better fit for how I play. I hate that I feel beaten down and discouraged from experimentation. I’m not building the hero I want to. I’m building the one that’s the path of least resistance in the face of hostile design.This whole process is so annoying that I actually broke one of my personal rules: I spent $50 on in-game currency, just to skip a bunch of levels on different heroes’ battle pass–style “Character Cards” to get the Polychoron rewards nestled in there. Even that wasn’t enough.What makes the entire exercise feel extra pointless and artificial is that you’re not being meaningfully rewarded. Because almost every activity in the game scales enemies’ levels up with yours, you never really feel like you’re getting more powerful. If anything, fights at higher power levels seem to take more time, not less. What good is doing 15,000 damage per hit if your foes now have hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of hit points. That’s not a game. That’s a treadmill.Listen, I get that the endless grind is part of the appeal of games like this, and there are moments when I see the allure, even in Avengers. Ultimately, though, it’s just far too extreme. In a game where you’d realistically only want to level a single character, this exact design approach might be acceptable. But this is a game with six different heroes at launch, and more planned to arrive in quick succession as the game continues. If I don’t continue playing it like a full-time job, I’m never going to keep up. As a result, I don’t want to keep up.There are plenty of games I would be happy to play and replay forever, but that’s because those games are innately fun and varied in their gameplay loops, not because designers and in-game economists and moneymen from the publishers have all worked together to give me an infinite checklist designed to maximize engagement statistics and per-player spend on cosmetics. Even if the monetization isn’t aggressive yet, and even if all the new heroes and content coming down the pike is admirably free, many aspects of Marvel’s Avengers still just feel… icky. There’s something deeply, unavoidably cynical about a game that never ends, that uses all the “best” design tricks the industry has learned from mobile, free-to-play, and MMO games to hook its players for an indefinite commitment that keeps mastery and completion forever out of reach. Some of these problems, I should be clear, aren’t unique to Avengers. These worrying design traits are cropping up everywhere, no doubt in response to ballooning development costs and unsustainable player expectations. Still, the mismatch feels particularly extreme in a game about heroes, one whose central theme is that being good is meaningless unless you do good. Marvel’s Avengers, judged on the values expressed through its design, seems to believe that simply not being outright evil is enough. Good luck telling that story forever.All images: Square Enix, Marvel.Marvel’s Avengers squanders the potential of what might have been a fun superhero romp by grafting on an annoying, overly repetitive games-as-a-service component. Playing as the cast of heroes offers decent thrills, and the campaign tells an enjoyable enough story, but odds are good you’ll get bored long before you grind your way to the top.
