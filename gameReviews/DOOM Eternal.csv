DOOM Eternal,Giovanni Marrelli,IGN,https://it.ign.com/doom-eternal-xbox-one/167265/review/doom-eternal-la-recensione,"ItaliaQuattro anni fa, id Software ha dato inizio a un percorso che avrebbe portato la nuova fucina di talenti capitanata da Marty Stratton e Hugo Martin a re-immaginare un franchise leggendario come DOOM per il mercato moderno. Il reboot di DOOM del 2016 era riuscito a catturare l'essenza del gioco originale, partorito nel 1993 da un gruppo di giovani visionari, reinterpretandola sulla base di quelle che sono le esigenze e i gusti dei giocatori di oggi, ma manifestando un'incredibile conoscenza e rispetto per il materiale d'origine.Quella visione d'insieme raggiunge la piena maturità grazie a DOOM Eternal, sequel dell'episodio lanciato nel 2016 che riesce ad arricchire e impreziosire una formula di gioco apprezzata dai fan con novità che non tentano di rivoluzionare, bensì di perfezionare oltremisura la spietata danza di pugni, proiettili e uccisioni epiche messa in scena dal letale Slayer.LA VIDEORECENSIONE DI DOOM ETERNAL Oggi come nel 2016, il protagonista di DOOM è chiamato in causa per fare ciò che gli riesce meglio di ogni altra cosa: sterminare demoni, mettendo fine a un percorso iniziato a suon di pugni e doppiette nei denti con l'episodio reboot. Per poi iniziare daccapo, in quell'eterna lotta che condanna il protagonista a una vita di massacri.Se c'è un elemento che caratterizza maggiormente il sequel Eternal, è la rinnovata attenzione di id Software nei confronti del comparto narrativo. Nel lungo viaggio in compagnia del silenzioso ma brutale Slayer, ho affrontato una nuova minaccia che ha colpito la Terra in seguito agli eventi del gioco di quattro anni fa, tentando di debellare le forze infernali ormai presenti in massa sul pianeta. E tocca proprio al nostro protagonista liberare la Terra dai demoni e mettere fine all'invasione affrontando il problema alla radice, uccidendo i tre Sacerdoti Infernali che guidano l'assalto prima di concentrarsi sulla ""testa del demone"".Attraverso un mix di cut-scene, documenti collezionabili e dialoghi in-game, id Software espande il canovaccio di DOOM Eternal senza appesantire quello che è il punto di forza del gioco, il ritmo. Lo fa tramite uno stile narrativo intelligente e mai eccessivamente pronunciato: le scene forniscono un'idea del contesto ma non si dilungano mai troppo, lasciando al giocatore un attimo di respiro tra un combattimento e l'altro ma evitando accuratamente di smorzare il senso di velocità e frenesia che regna per tutta la durata della campagna.Quella di Eternal è un'avventura lunga, impegnativa e avvincente, che riesce a inserire nel contesto elementi di estrema rilevanza nella mitologia della saga DOOM (la razza Maykr e il potere Argent, le Sentinelle e l'eterna lotta tra bene e male) e, complice una serie di eventi inaspettati nella seconda metà della campagna, fornire una nuova prospettiva sulla storia del brand. Dimostrandosi ben più di un semplice riempitivo e riconnettendo il passato al presente, dando il ""la"" per un futuro radioso per la serie. Sempre che si possa intendere ""radioso"" un domani in cui la prospettiva migliore è di infilare una granata in bocca a un Cacodemone, s'intende.La storia di Eternal è funzionale a mettere in risalto quello che, come detto, è il vero protagonista di DOOM: il gameplay. Mantenute le idee e le peculiarità già viste e apprezzate nell'episodio del 2016, id Software ha deciso di aggiungere un po' di pepe creando un meccanismo che prevede il recupero di energia, armatura e munizioni sulla base di azioni specifiche, quella ""morra cinese"" che dà un'idea ben precisa del funzionamento dell'economia di gioco. Le uccisioni epiche danno allo Slayer un po' di energia vitale, l'uso della motosega permette di recuperare munizioni, incendiare i nemici con il lanciafiamme consente di ripristinare parte della propria armatura, che aumenta in caso di uccisione dei nemici colpiti.Soprattutto ai livelli di difficoltà più elevati, è impossibile portare a termine uno scontro senza una corretta alternanza tra i tre elementi succitati, dal momento che le risorse da cui attingere nello scenario non sono mai particolarmente generose e si finisce ben presto con l'esaurire munizioni o ritrovarsi in fin di vita. È importante dunque che si entri nell'ottica di affrontare ogni combattimento con una strategia ben precisa, attaccando i nemici più pericolosi senza lasciarsi prendere dalla fretta e sfruttando Imp o demoni più abbordabili per recuperare munizioni, armature ed energia vitale.Gruppi di nemici sono l'ideale per sfruttare il lanciafiamme e ottenere così un grande quantitativo di corazza, meglio se utilizzando la granata congelante (da alternare a quella esplosiva, ciascuna con un suo cooldown) per bloccarli in posizione e avere così il tempo di respirare, riorganizzando le idee in vista del bersaglio successivo. Più di ogni altra cosa, in DOOM Eternal è fondamentale non fermarsi mai e per alcun motivo: muoversi nello scenario, sfruttando la verticalità delle ambientazioni e i ripari naturali è di vitale importanza per sfuggire dalle situazioni difficili, sfruttando il salto e la doppia schivata per interrompere il contatto visivo e attaccare un altro avversario isolato.Se nelle prime ore di gioco si riesce a tenere testa agli avversari senza prestare troppa attenzione ai proiettili restanti o all'armatura, col passare del tempo si iniziano ad affrontare demoni più potenti e gruppi di nemici sempre più numerosi che costringono lo Slayer a non fermarsi praticamente mai, ma soprattuto a gestire le armi e abilità in base al tipo di nemico che ci si trova davanti. Come nel predecessore, anche in Eternal ogni nemico dispone di un punto debole e può essere sterminato in specifici modi, per cui diventa di fondamentale importanza per il giocatore osservare continuamente l'ambientazione, prestare attenzione all'eventuale spawn di nuovi nemici e non sprecare munizioni delle armi potenti per affrontare nemici che possono essere sterminati diversamente. In tal senso, alternare mod delle armi incluse nell'arsenale dello Slayer (ancora una volta intercambiabili con un semplice tasto e utilizzabili col grilletto sinistro) è importante per trarre vantaggio dalle specifiche debolezze altrui.Il team di id Software ha fatto un lavoro a dir poco notevole nell'introdurre nuovi nemici, come ad esempio la fastidiosa Flagellante, una creatura viscida che striscia lungo lo scenario e può eludere facilmente gli attacchi dello Slayer (ma che può essere arrestata con una granata congelante), o nel rielaborare vecchie conoscenze della saga come l'Elementale del Dolore, in grado di evocare anime infernali ma particolarmente sensibile ai colpi della balista. La varietà, in termini di avversari e demoni che incontrerete lungo il cammino, è uno dei maggiori punti di forza di DOOM Eternal ed emerge prepotentemente quando si tratta di affrontare le parti più avanzate della campagna o le stesse missioni della storia a un livello di difficoltà più ampio.Una parte importante dell'esperienza di gioco è di certo l'esplorazione dello scenario, che espande le meccaniche già viste nel gioco di qualche anno fa per dar vita a vere e proprie sezioni di platforming basate sull'uso di salto, doppio salto, arrampicata e schivata, nonché di particolari interazioni ambientali che danno vita a enigmi spesso interessanti, ma non sempre riusciti alla perfezione, e che risaltano di più proprio perché il resto, al contrario, è molto vicino a raggiungerla, quella perfezione. La colpa, se vogliamo, è anche di un level design che in alcuni momenti risulta poco chiaro e rischia di confondere il giocatore, rallentando un po' il ritmo dell'avventura (ma mai eccessivamente).In alcuni momenti, poi, si ha l'impressione che il sistema di controllo non sia sempre perfetto nel recepire gli input del giocatore, costringendo a ripetere più volte una specifica sezione e causando un po' di frustrazione. Nulla che non sia risolvibile con un po' di sano trial & error, grazie a un sistema di checkpoint molto buono che il più delle volte permette di ripartire dall'esatto punto di morte.Alcune fasi platform sono fondamentali per progredire lungo la campagna, altre invece sono del tutto opzionali: si tratta di quelle probabilmente più intricate, ma capaci di offrire le migliori soddisfazioni una volta portate a termine. Esplorando a fondo lo scenario, ci si imbatte in segreti come vite extra, cheat code o risorse necessarie per la progressione dello Slayer, ma la vera novità consiste in un sistema di sfide molto più avanzato del reboot, che premia coloro che decideranno di setacciare a fondo le ambientazioni con scontri ancora più impegnativi.id Software ha deciso infatti di alzare la posta in gioco introducendo, in alcune missioni della storia, delle sfide opzionali che metteranno a dura prova persino i più esperti: la prima tipologia, chiamata Cancello Slayer, consiste in un'arena separata accessibile solo dopo aver scovato l'apposita chiave nella mappa, e che ci proietta in uno scontro feroce contro nemici avanzati (tanti) e molto aggressivi. Completando un Cancello Slayer si ottiene una ricompensa particolare, da ""spendere"" nell'hub principale: ottenendone sei potrete sbloccare un'arma segreta che stamperebbe un sorriso a trentadue denti persino sul viso (o casco...) di un burbero come lo Slayer.La seconda tipologia di eventi opzionali consiste in totem nascosti con i quali potrete interagire per iniziare sfide a tempo: gruppi di nemici compariranno nei paraggi e dovranno essere sconfitti entro pochi secondi dallo spawn, pena il fallimento. Non essendoci un limite al numero di tentativi possibili, la vera sfida consiste nel capire il modo ottimale per affrontare i nemici sfruttando le risorse in proprio possesso, ma il risultato finale vale assolutamente lo sforzo.Già, perché come il DOOM del 2016 ci ha insegnato, lo Slayer può essere potenziato spendendo una serie di punti che guadagnerete completando i succitati eventi opzionali, ma anche portando a termine particolari sfide (ad esempio effettuando un'uccisione epica su una classe di nemici in particolare). Questi punti sono utilizzabili per potenziare le armi, ancora una volta caratterizzati da un sistema di due mod potenziabili progressivamente fino a raggiungere il grado di maestria (completando un'apposita sfida, o utilizzando uno dei Token Maestria nascosti nello scenario).Potenziare le armi è fondamentale per affrontare le fasi più avanzate della campagna, ma non è l'unico elemento su cui intervenire per prepararsi a ciò che verrà: il nuovo sistema di Rune consente di donare allo Slayer un massimo di tre abilità, che vanno dall'effettuare uccisioni epiche più rapidamente al rallentare il tempo quando il giocatore è in fin di vita, consentendo dunque di ragionare sul da farsi e procedere a una rapida fuga. Come nel caso dei punti per potenziare le armi, anche le Rune possono essere scovate tramite apposite sfide o l'esplorazione dei vari livelli, e possono essere cambiate in ogni momento dell'avventura dall'apposito menu.Diverso il discorso per l'armatura Praetor, che si basa su un duplice sistema di punti sbloccabili (ancora una volta tramite apposite sfide) e Cristalli Sentinelle per conferire al giocatore nuove abilità interessanti. I punti possono essere spesi attraverso cinque diverse categorie (dall'esplorazione all'ambiente, passando per power-up dei due tipi di granate), mentre i Cristalli Sentinelle sono scovabili in alcune missioni e si trovano generalmente in punti nascosti delle mappe. Spendendo questi cristalli, potrete come sempre intervenire sul numero massimo di Salute, Corazza e Munizioni trasportabili, ma è sbloccando entrambi gli slot di un singolo set che sbloccherete il vero potenziale di quell'abilità, incrementando il raggio di raccolta automatico delle risorse o velocizzando la ricarica del Pugno di sangue, una mossa che consente di sferrare un poderoso pugno capace di uccidere la maggior parte dei nemici in un sol colpo.Capirete che per ottenere il massimo da DOOM Eternal non basta sparare a più non posso finché non si esauriscono i proiettili, ma bisogna dedicarsi a esplorare e completare le attività secondarie per diventare più forti e massimizzare l'efficacia dello Slayer in combattimento. Quale migliore occasione di testare le abilità del cacciatore di demoni se non tramite i Livelli Master? Si tratta di particolari versioni delle missioni già completate nella campagna, impreziosite dalla presenza di tutti i nemici avanzati che incontrereste normalmente solo sul finire dell'avventura.Missioni che diventano improvvisamente molto più ostiche e costringono il giocatore a dosare alla perfezione i singoli elementi di gameplay, facendo attenzione a cambiare opportunamente i moduli delle armi per sbarazzarsi dei nemici più impegnativi e a gestire al meglio la geometria dello scenario per eludere continuamente gli attacchi dei nemici, tentando di restare in vita tra un'uccisione epica e un colpo di motosega. Al momento, id Software ha creato solo due Livelli Master (Complesso Arc e Base dei Seguaci, disponibile con il pre-order di Eternal), ma lo scopo è di continuare ad aggiungerne di continuo per mantenere vivo l'interesse attorno al gioco.Con il lancio ufficiale arriverà anche il sistema di Invasioni, che permetterà a un giocatore di irrompere nelle partite altrui, e sarà ulteriormente arricchito il sistema di sfide, che include tutta una serie di obiettivi da portare a termine per sbloccare nuovi elementi con cui personalizzare il proprio personaggio. A tal proposito, gli sviluppatori hanno fatto il solito lavoro magistrale nel riempire l'ecosistema di DOOM Eternal di un numero incredibile di oggetti.Da skin per le armi e il personaggio a pupazzetti dei demoni da custodire in una bacheca, da brani delle colonne sonore dei vecchi capitoli della saga a elementi estetici per personalizzare l'emblema, ma anche nuove schermate introduttive e pose vittoriose da utilizzare nel multiplayer: c'è letteralmente un mondo di contenuti da scovare in DOOM Eternal, elemento che farà certamente la gioia dei collezionisti (e dei nostalgici, ma non voglio rovinarvi la sorpresa!) che spenderanno ore e ore per ottenere ogni singolo segreto.Segreti che possono essere custoditi nell'astronave dello Slayer, hub centrale da cui potrete attivare Livelli Master o rigiocare le vecchie missioni, oppure allenarvi nell'apposita arena di addestramento, o ancora sbloccare alcuni segreti, rune e modifiche extra accessibili spendendo le Batterie delle Sentinelle, l'ennesima risorsa ottenibile esplorando gli scenari di DOOM Eternal.Di carne al fuoco, come potete vedere, ce n'è davvero tanta, ma è solo una parte di ciò che sarà l'esperienza finale di DOOM Eternal: parlo al futuro perché al momento di scrivere questa recensione, i server della modalità Battlemode non erano ancora operativi, ragion per cui in questo articolo non possiamo esprimere un giudizio compiuto su quello che sarà il PvP asimmetrico studiato da id Software. Nella nostra prova siamo riusciti a effettuare qualche sessione tramite i tutorial, divisi in varie tipologie e focalizzati sull'apprendimento delle mosse dei singoli demoni utilizzabili in questa modalità.Da quanto ci è stato possibile vedere, la Battlemode sembra essere un netto passo in avanti rispetto al multiplayer (trascurabile) di Doom 2016, con delle meccaniche interessanti (come la possibilità, per i demoni, di evocare dei minion con cui infastidire lo Slayer) che tuttavia necessitano di prove approfondite per essere comprese appieno.LA SFIDA IMPARI DELLA BATTLEMODEUna delle novità più rilevanti di DOOM Eternal è la rinnovata modalità multiplayer, che abbandona la formula precedente per offrire uno scontro 2 vs 1 mettendo due demoni estremamente letali contro uno Slayer potenziato al massimo.Leggi le nostre impressioni sulla Battlemode!Ciò che importa, però, è che anche in assenza di un pezzo forte come il multiplayer, DOOM Eternal risulta un netto passo in avanti rispetto a un'esperienza di per sé già ottima come quella dell'episodio lanciato quattro anni fa. Tutto, dalla portata della campagna single-player al feeling del gameplay, è migliorato al punto da sembrare un gioco estremamente diverso rispetto al reboot del 2016, pur mantenendo un'impronta tremendamente familiare. Ed è proprio questo il pregio di id Software, che è riuscita a non stravolgere quanto di buono fatto in precedenza arricchendo la formula di gioco con piccoli dettagli, finezze e i soliti tocchi di classe.Anche a livello tecnico, lo shooter si conferma eccellente mostrando i muscoli di un motore grafico granitico come l'id Tech della software house, capace di muoversi in modo incessante a 60 fotogrammi per secondo, non importa quanti demoni e quanti proiettili si muovono simultaneamente su schermo. DOOM Eternal è un gran bel vedere, con le sue tinte rosso sangue, le animazioni brutali ma sempre estremamente soddisfacenti, il feeling assurdo delle armi... e queste sensazioni non possono che essere amplificate da quello spettacolo di colonna sonora creata da Mick Gordon.Le musiche di DOOM Eternal sono di una potenza inaudita, aggressive e sempre pronte a enfatizzare i momenti nevralgici della storia. Il compositore è riuscito a mischiare sonorità dure e industrial mantenendo l'essenza del DOOM di quattro anni prima, ma raggiungendo nuove vette in termini di coinvolgimento. Perché vedersela con un Barone Infernale o un Razziatore (li ho odiati con tutto me stesso!) non sarebbe stata la stessa cosa, senza quella musica sparata a palla nelle orecchie.MODUS OPERANDI
Ho giocato a DOOM Eternal grazie a un codice digitale per Xbox fornito dal distributore, che ho utilizzato su Xbox One X collegata a una TV Samsung UE40ES8000. Ho portato a termine la campagna al livello di difficoltà intermedio in una ventina di ore (il gioco non include un contatore specifico), potenziando quasi completamente l'armatura Praetor e sbloccando tutte le Rune, per poi provare una manciata di missioni della campagna ai livelli più elevati. Ho speso qualche altra ora cimentandomi nei due livelli Master attualmente disponibili, per poi prepararmi alla Battlemode attraverso una lunga serie di tutorial in attesa che i server europei siano operativi.Migliorare il Doom del 2016 non era un'impresa facile, ma id Software ha dimostrato di essere perfettamente in grado di gestire un compito del genere sfornando un sequel spettacolare e ancora più ricco dell'episodio precedente. Tutto, in DOOM Eternal, è stato ampliato e perfezionato dagli sviluppatori al fine di mantenere quella frenesia, quel ritmo asfissiante nei combattimenti, quella costante necessità di movimento di un Doom Slayer oggi più in forma che mai. Al netto di qualche sbavatura nelle fasi platform, non sempre ispirate o pienamente efficaci, DOOM Eternal si conferma uno degli migliori sparatutto di questa generazione (se non uno dei migliori di sempre). Un progetto ambizioso che riesce a migliorare le meccaniche di gioco senza intaccare quel difficile equilibrio che il team di sviluppo aveva raggiunto con il rifacimento di quattro anni fa, infarcendo il tutto con una storia interessante e mai invasiva. Aspettando di capire che tipo di impatto avrà la modalità multiplayer sull'ecosistema, è tempo di lucidare la doppietta e iniziare l'eterna caccia di demoni.DOOM Eternal DOOM Eternal "

Link: Official site (opens in new tab)I just finished Doom Eternal and I'm feeling anxious and exhausted. I've kneed the underside of my desk too many times to count from tensing up. My hands are soft from sweating and my knuckles crack when I try to make a fist. Doom Eternal is a celebration of excess. Excess in sin, in violence, scale, speed, and volume. I've never played a shooter this intense and demanding. Doom Eternal also runs beautifully on a wide range of hardware and feels designed for a mouse and keyboard first. It's a modern classic, with a few caveats. Cheap deaths from getting stuck on geometry happen too often. There are six or seven layers of unnecessary progression. Doom's dark humor has mostly been traded in for deep lore and a high-fantasy cosmology. And the strain from a heavy focus on resource management is felt at every difficulty level. I worry that for some, it could be Doom: But Too Much. But ""too much"" works for me as Eternal's guiding light. The moment to moment combat is distilled panic rather than empowerment. I live for the fleeting moments my head gets above water within the hurricane of light and noise and extravagant violence, and I pull off a feat of accuracy and reflex I never thought I was capable of before. Doom Eternal is a tough teacher. A few hours in I'm getting by just fine, juggling half a dozen weapons, belching fire on the hordes to spawn armor to stay afloat, tossing grenades at every opportunity to stun and soften up the crowd. I'm dashing in and out of the action for the occasional Glory Kill to keep my health topped off, dodging projectiles and managing the arena, deciding, between breaths if I remember to breathe, which demons to attack based on who's currently kicking my ass the most. Late into the fight a marauder appears. This guy has an axe, a shield, and only opens up to damage if you counter a specific attack with a precisely timed gunshot. Blasting it with a rocket barrage does absolutely nothing. With this enemy design, Doom is asking me to stop shooting and moving so much. It's playing with the comfort zone I've built over decades of playing arena shooters. Now I have to let up on the trigger, to circle-strafe and assume the calm restraint of a Dark Souls duel. I hate this enemy at first, but then I get the hang of it after a dozen or so attempts. I've been playing these shooters since I was a teen. But Eternal isn't just asking me to get intimate with my keyboard's number row, it's challenging me to change playstyles in the middle of a classic Doom arena fight, to stop doing boxing and start doing judo. Managing resources, switching weapons, staying on the move, prioritizing demons based on the arena shape and current threat is plenty to juggle for most people, but Doom Eternal makes you change age-old habits too.Doom's guns aren't as subject to this complexity. The old gang is back again. Hello, combat shotgun. Hello, plasma rifle. Hello, BFG. With more opportunities to refill ammunition and heaps more arenas with ways to get airborne, the previously underutilized ballista gets heavy use as a railgun stand-in and stylish airborne demon deletion tool. Updated viewmodels reinforce each weapon's heft and sheen, and the gun skins rewarded for completing certain milestones are weird, but not unwelcome in a singleplayer game. Refined reload and firing animations imbue each with a sense of mechanical realism, especially the alternate firing modes, which have way more utility this time. But the guns haven't lost the fundamental character they had in Doom 2016. The big changes in Doom Eternal are in how it handles resource management. Farming armor from the same guy I'm dueling creates a give-and-take with enemies that isn't present in other shooters.Glory Kills still reward health for staggering a demon and finishing them with a special melee kill animation, but chainsaw kills, which drop ammo, are far more important for keeping your guns fed. Burning through every bullet takes very little time. Throw in the flame belch, a tool that lights demons on fire to make them puke up armor for a bit, and suddenly half of each fight becomes about juggling resources. I regularly had to dip out of Marauder fights to chase down a stray demon for ammo or health. Making your enemies your life-saving resources contributes to the overbearing tension of Doom Eternal. Chasing demons into a dangerously tight space normally isn't a great idea, except when it's the setup for a quick flame belch followed by a grenade or rocket. Every stray imp is a potential ammo cache, so keeping a few around just in case is a good plan, so long as you're willing to pay the annoying fireball tax. You have to confront these guys to stay alive, and it's rarely on your own terms.It was all overwhelming at first, frustrating second, and then suddenly novel and exciting. Yes, it makes zero sense that you light monsters on fire in order to get them to drop armor shards. But oddities like this feed into an exhausting, anxiety-inducing, thrilling-once-you-get-it vibe, and farming armor from the same guy I'm dueling creates a give-and-take with enemies that isn't present in other shooters.These more unfamiliar ideas could do with a bit more onboarding, and Eternal's current solution of spelling out how to beat every new demon (even bosses!) with on-screen explainers isn't exactly elegant. Trial and error is essential to Eternal's learning curve, which wasn't the greatest way to acclimate myself to the new ideas and systems introduced throughout its 15-hour runtime.But the ideas settle easier if you're packing any Extra Lives, literal old-timey 1UPs hidden around each level that keep the momentum going with an instant respawn. I only wish they weren't automatically spent with death, since I lost plenty from stupid mistakes. A prompt would be nice, because Doom Eternal's fights get larger, more complex, and more challenging than ever. I died so, so much. Turns out there are still plenty of novel ways to push my pointing and clicking skills. I wanted to spend more time soaking in Eternal's incredible settings rather than just shooting and dashing my way through them.Doom Eternal release date (opens in new tab): Everything we know

Weapon points, runes, secrets, sentinel batteries, suit upgrades, challenges, weapon mods, skins, weapon mod upgrades, weapon mastery upgrades—it's a lot. Too much, really, because Eternal places the bulk of these upgrades along the critical path. By the end I had almost every upgrade and without trying too hard to find them all, as if it's all an elaborate cardboard front built to make players feel good while ensuring they stay at pace with the steep difficulty curve.Secrets give a little incentive to stop and dig out extra upgrades and collectibles, but they're clearly marked on the map, and Doom Eternal's level design is extremely straightforward. I miss the mazes of old FPS games (or recent homages like Ion Maiden), where finding that last keycard or a hidden door was a big victory. Eternal's goal is momentum with little room for downtime. The ability to climb certain walls, dash in midair, and swing from monkey bars makes for some challenging navigation sequences, but I wanted to spend more time soaking in Eternal's incredible settings rather than just shooting and dashing my way through them. The new forms of mobility do shine in the arena, though, especially with how these fights scale up so quickly. It's Doom 2016 endgame stuff from pretty early on, and then surpasses that benchmark, adding tougher demons and even more waves and wild configurations of them, and then surpasses that mark again and again. The dash is essential for dodging projectiles, but even more so for map awareness. Dashing out of the fray and to a decent vantage point wins a split second to see what you're up against, and any chance to scan the crowd and prioritize a target makes a big difference. Those brief moments of respite allow me to land a nice scoped shot with the chaingun on an arachnotron's scorpion-tail gun turret to make them less of a threat, or freeze a slithering whiplash demon with an ice bomb so it holds still for a gun hug. Combat arenas vary from tiny, crowded shotgun gauntlets to huge multilayered jungle gyms. A favorite spans a bubbling river of fire, jump pads on every terrace of the elaborate blistery structures consuming a ruined city. Monkeybars jut out from walls all over that I can swing off of, making it possible to stay in the air for the majority of the fight. I don't have to touch the ground between gibbing a revenant with the railgun and grappling right up to the dumb grin of a cacodemon with the super shotgun's new meat hook attachment. My super shotgun's meat hook sets any demons it lodges into on fire, a cute touch.I cheated the game and didn't cheat myself. Doom Eternal is happy for me. Feels great.The arenas jive with the expanded mobility for a more expressive combat experience than 2016. If I want to do it, I probably can, as if there's an uninterrupted circuit between my brain, the mouse and keyboard, and the Doomguy. It's why getting stuck on Doom's occasionally jagged hell-geometry is such a momentum killer.It happened right at the end of my eighth or so attempt on an early boss. A strenuous arena fight with two Doom Hunters was almost over—I just needed to finish one off—but a smaller demon spawned in front of me and body-blocked me into a corner. Three seconds of standing still and I was dead. I think Doom Eternal knew something was up, because before I respawned a prompt popped up and asked if I wanted to put on some Sentinel Armor. It's a difficulty-bracing system that kicks in after a couple deaths and gives you a buff that decreases damage for specific fights. I took the offer and feel better for it because I probably would have stopped playing for a while otherwise. Between the variable difficulties—I pushed through on Ultra-Violence—and salves like Sentinel Armor and extra lives that help remove friction, Doom Eternal did an excellent job pushing me just beyond my limit without burning me out, despite the occasional unfair death.Doom Eternal is a challenging game, but it won't stop you if you'd prefer to take a breezy tour through metal album landscapes and demon guts. Cheats don't affect progression at all. You can clean up any collectibles (except Slayer Gates, an endgame challenge) and finish the whole thing as an unkillable machine. Just drop Eternal to its easiest difficulty and go cheat hunting. They're clearly marked on the map along with every other collectible. My favs: Party Mode and QuakeCon Mode. The former makes demons pop like confetti pinatas and the latter frames the action with a 'live' audience that cheers or boos based on how well you're doing. There's even a 'woo' guy. Paired with the classic center-screen gun perspective and a new option that gives Doomguy and his weapons their classic sounds, I'm having a blast whipping through the levels on a second playthrough, cleaning up collectibles as an immortal demigod in a well earned victory lap after my vanilla Ultra-Violence run. I cheated the game and didn't cheat myself. Doom Eternal is happy for me. Feels great.Eternal revisits plenty of old scenery, Hell and Mars included, but also goes to some unexpected locations with distinct architecture and color palettes. Doom 2016 was red and blue. Doom Eternal throws in purple and green and gold and grey. If there was any downtime in Doom Eternal, it was because I stopped between fights to soak in the scale and majesty of its vistas. Demons as tall as skyscrapers carrying hell barges around on their backs, swarms of dozens of cacodemons like gnats in the distance, ancient sentinel castles climbing mossy mountains into the clouds—Doom is a full on high fantasy world now, pages and pages of optional lore included. Doom Eternal feels like it was made for the PC first.Some of the natural humor is dulled as a result, but I still laugh every time I hear the cartoonish pop of a cacodemon's eye getting ripped from the socket. Besides, Doom taking itself this seriously feels like a joke of its own. I didn't really care much for the story anyway, even after reading every codex entry. Nothing was lost or gained. It's thematic dressing, an excuse for wack, outrageous settings and action sequences, BFGs, even B'er FGs, and so on. Musically, it's an evolution, not a reinvention. Mick Gordon builds on the Doom 2016 sound with chanting heavy metal choruses and a darker, black metal-adjacent vibe overall. This is still a very familiar energetic Meshuggah-inspired sound that I love, it just didn't cover as much new ground as I'd hoped. But without Gordon's signature sound, Doom Eternal would feel empty. The music is integral to the action, an undercurrent of energy to aspire to.In the new Battlemode it's possible to duke it out with other players, either as the slayer or a few demons. It's a multiplayer mode much more aligned with the spirit of Doom, but it wasn't available to try out during the pre-release period. PCG's Emma Matthews had a chance to try it in February and thought it matched the heart-rending pace of the singleplayer mode, it just isn't the main attraction here. We'll be sure to spend more time with it once the servers go live, but whether Battlemode is great or not doesn't change how worthwhile Doom Eternal already is. This is a pretty slick computer game, folks.Doom Eternal feels like it was made for the PC first, too. I had zero hiccups during my 15-hour playthrough. No crashes, no hitching, and I didn't have to bump a single setting down to get my framerate above 120 fps at 1440p. Granted, I have a juicy rig (RTX 2080, i9-9900K), but I'm still used to playing with post-processing junk to inch my fps higher. Our performance review shows Doom Eternal maxed out and maintaining 60 fps at 1080p on a GTX 1650, a $150 GPU. Doom is seriously an industry standout in this regard.Arenas are filled with dozens of demons at once, each one like their own bespoke muppet, each detailed and present in how they're put together and how they fall apart. The gore system breaks them up piece by piece, exposing gristle and bruised muscle and bones underneath. And Doom never skips a beat rendering all the demon bits and weapon effects and wild environments, my mouse whipping around so fast as if to dare it to all gum up. Nah. Anything less than perfect performance wouldn't do, because Doom Eternal is one of the most demanding arena shooters I've ever played, a game that teases out and hones every muscle memory committed to my right forearm and left hand fingertips since they graced a mouse and keyboard. It's bright and loud, hyper violent yet tastefully refined, and absolutely draining. I can't recall playing a shooter where sensory overload was one of the most common reasons for death. Doom Eternal is a ceaseless, panicked nightmare that pushes you to point and click with more skill and style than ever before. James is stuck in an endless loop, playing the Dark Souls games on repeat until Elden Ring and Silksong set him free. He's a truffle pig for indie horror and weird FPS games too, seeking out games that actively hurt to play. Otherwise he's wandering Austin, identifying mushrooms and doodling grackles. The most important shooters of the last 5 yearsBethesda rejects Mick Gordon allegations as 'distortion of the truth'Wordle hint and answer #665: Saturday, April 15By Phil Iwaniuk6 April 2023By Dave James5 April 2023By Kizito Katawonga4 April 2023By Jacob Ridley4 April 2023By Ian Evenden4 April 2023By Jorge Jimenez3 April 2023By Luke Winkie3 April 2023By Ted Litchfield31 March 2023By Robin Valentine31 March 2023By Katie Wickens31 March 2023By Dave James30 March 2023PC Gamer is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

DOOM Eternal,Edwin Evans-Thirlwell,Eurogamer,https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-03-16-doom-eternal-review,"Groundhog slay.""Story in a game is like a story in a porn movie,"" the original Doom's programmer John Carmack once wrote. ""It's expected to be there, but it's not that important."" A connoisseur of sleaze might object that story often makes for sexier porn - after all, story tends to involve chemistry, atmosphere, suspense and all the other emotions that distinguish intimacy from the act of banging together genitals to spark a human being. Still, if we're going to liken games to pornography, and assuming it's the more kinetic kind of pornography you're after, I heartily recommend Doom Eternal: a looping video compilation of oversized guns and fists plunging into squelchy orifices, spurting along at 60 frames a second.2016's accomplished reboot was already quite the debauch, its firefights punctuated by leering close-ups of skewered hellspawn, its heavy metal soundtrack always building to a crescendo. Eternal turns up the heat even further, allowing you to dash and flip your way around arenas that are newly fixated on the vertical axis. Dripping organs are wrenched out of, then stuffed back into, demon torsos; chargeable alt-fires scream for release; health orbs spatter the ramps and chokepoints like - well, you get the picture. The environments often look like the work of an adolescent H.R. Giger who's just got into AC/DC. Aside from silvery Protoss-ish fortresses and some seriously down-at-heel office blocks, you'll wander labyrinths of squirming flesh, using runes to unclench toothy sphincters and shearing pop-up tentacles in half with your shotgun. Some, of course, will soberly insist that all of this is just good, honest, videogame violence - clean, upstanding fun with absolutely no over- or undertones whatsoever. And to these people I say: when I am walking down the shaft of an enormous spear, straight into the pierced belly of a reeling, gaping titan, it is difficult to argue that there isn't some kind of metaphor in play. ""Rip and tear""? More like rip and splooge.Carmack's porn quote (which he has since qualified a little) epitomises the view that narrative in games is always an imposition, a foreign body carried over from film and literature. It's a view that has been roundly debunked. The thing is, though, Eternal does have a story, somewhere in amongst the parade of demon O-faces, and while that story is lightweight by Zenimax game standards, it feels hopelessly grafted on. Having thwarted Hell's invasion of Mars, the legendary Doom Slayer must purge Earth itself of diabolical interlopers, setting out from a gothic orbital station turned customisation hub to a series of ravaged cities, factories and temples that feel on loan from Gears of War. In the process, he must also tunnel back into a startlingly eventful past, sitting through flashbacks and wrangling with old allies.The 2016 game was a thrilling reimagining of the speed and ferocity of 90s Doom combat, but it also magnified Doom's narrative trappings, adding in cutscenes, audio diaries, codex entries and mid-mission dialogue - a curious reversal of one of id's key decisions with the original game, which was once planned to include a sizeable narrative component written by co-founder Tom Hall. Eternal adds yet more to the load, expanding the cast and redoubling the emphasis on lore.The cutscenes are now a mix of first and third-person, which means the Slayer is a fully tangible human being - one you can, moreover, trick out with unlockable outfits and weapon skins - rather than a pair of enormous fists twitching beneath your aiming reticle. He feels enclosed by the fiction, rather than, as Christian Donlan put it back in the day, like a man who is also playing Doom and who shares your resentment for anything that gets in the way. There's some effort to explain the character's superhuman prowess, with one scientist suggesting that you represent humanity's rage to survive, as opposed to humanity's love of making Cacodemons pop in slow motion. The Slayer even has a voice these days, though I think he strings together maybe five words in total. True, our man in green never looks happy with all the attention, stomping impatiently through cinematics while other parties monologue at his retreating head (if they're lucky, that is - the fate of most speaking roles in Eternal is to be ground up like tuna). Nor are you required to listen to the audio diaries, or dip into the codex. But these elements drag on you nonetheless, like the lakes of purple goop that stop you running or jumping in certain levels. They're a deflating reminder that you are no longer here just to indulge your baser instincts. Conversely, the developer's guilty awareness that people don't play Doom for the narrative means that when you do dig into the world-building, you'll find it to be scanty and by-the-numbers: a set of tired references to ancient races, legendary battles and fallen cities.Still, if visceral gratification is the goal, Eternal amply delivers. The combat is once again about ceaseless pivoting between attack and retreat, care of a raucous battlefield ecology which sees you ripping ammo, health and armour refills from your prey rather than just searching for medikits or finding somewhere to cool off. Stun a foe and you can execute them for a smidgeon of health. These executions double as windows of rest, with other demons easing off till you're done rearranging your victim's anatomy. They can also be triggered from metres away, warping you to the target without even the courtesy of a transitional animation, which means you can use them to escape or get behind a mob. Bisect demons with your trusty chainsaw, meanwhile, and you'll be rewarded with a geyser of ammo, restocking all your weapons in one dollop. You'll need plenty of chainsaw fuel to carve up the bigger demons, but you'll always have enough to carve up the smaller ""fodder"" demons, who spawn endlessly throughout each battle till the larger demons are slain. This hyper-aggressive resourcing style forces you to close the gap with foes who are, in any case, very good at running you down. Some, like the minion-summoning Archville, are closer to terrain hazards, but the underworld's legions are light on snipers or artillery; pretty much everybody, from the podgy Mancubus to the serpentine Whiplash, is hell-bent on getting in your face. It sounds like chaos, and often is, but there's a lot of science to Eternal's combat, and solid artistry to how the key variables are conveyed from second to second. Ammo, health and armour drops are colour-coded; staggered enemies flash blue, then orange when you're within striking distance. The game's audio is similarly readable, once you acclimatise to the roaring heavy metal soundtrack. You'll learn to follow the progress of the battle by ear - be it the tink of a cooldown gauge, the belch of a Cacodemon that has just swallowed something explosive, teeing it up for an execution, or the nasal howl of a charging Pinky.New variables include an ice grenade, mapped to the trigger, which lets you flash-freeze whole groups to interrupt otherwise lethal offensives. You can also light foes up with your shoulder flamethrower attachment, causing them to spit out armour parts and further motivating you to fight at close quarters when you're hurting. The most important change-up, however, is your newfound agility. Besides availing himself of launchpads, the Slayer can now perform aerial dashes, scuttle up laddered surfaces, swing from monkey bars and use a Super Shotgun-mounted grapple line to yank himself towards or past enemies. This encourages showboating reminiscent of anti-gravity duels in the sadly-forgotten Lawbreakers. You might grapple somebody, fling yourself past them while firing your shotgun pointblank, then double-jump to a monkey bar, hurling yourself at a stunned Pain Elemental, then drop neatly onto a launchpad while switching to your Heavy Assault Rifle so that you can carpet the arena in micro-missiles. The weapons are by and large entertaining rejigs of Doom 2016's offerings, with two upgradeable alternate-fires per gun that lend themselves to different tactics and different opponents. Your shotgun, for instance, can serve as either a sticky grenade launcher - useful when trying to shoot the turret off a Cyberdemon - or a buckshot-firing Gatling gun for crowd control. Inevitably, the charm of Eternal diminishes the further you travel from these firefights. Its grander story component aside, the game is slightly over-burdened with customisation systems. Besides tracking down weapon mods in levels themselves, you'll equip runes for perks such as slow-mo when you aim in mid-air, together with Praetor Suit upgrades such as the ability to suck in health drops from further away. There's a knack to combining Rune perks, especially when tackling ""Master"" versions of levels that have more punishing enemy spawn patterns, but the role-playing systems aren't novel, and the associated menu-diving bogs down a shooter that's at its best in the thick of the bloodshed.What really saps Eternal, however, is the predictable way the campaign once again breaks down into combat bowls and platforming stretches that feel like they've been stripped at random from Prince of Persia: Sands of Time. There are collectibles to unearth, some tucked in high alcoves or behind smashable walls, together with optional hidden battle chambers, but the alternation of shoot-out then jumpy bit then shoot-out is the same throughout. Boss battles are the biggest change of tune - the final clash is a doozie, a gruelling two-phase affair in which your nemesis looms over the layout like the world's angriest D&D player. But some of them are just annoying, a question of repeating a tactic to whittle down a health-bar. It's revealing that the game offers you a layer of all-but-indestructible Sentinel armour after a certain number of deaths, though Eternal's accessibility is otherwise refreshing: dropping the difficulty doesn't cost you anything in terms of progress, and you revert to the previous difficulty once the bossfight is over.It's worth remembering that old school Doom wasn't just a series of one-man massacres. It could be ominous and anxiety-inducing. It had monsters you could hear through walls, shambling about in the guts of the level, and concealed partitions that slid open without warning. It had a narrative, just about, but it didn't try to root the weirdness of its concept or spaces in lore, and its secrets were as much about enjoying the possibilities of virtual architecture as securing a power-up. It was a world of alarming corners and optical tricks that deformed and shifted simply because it could. For all its abundance of things to find, you don't get quite the same feeling in Doom Eternal. At times, it feels like the levels have been designed backwards from the completion screen, with its grocery lists of optional treasures and encounters. You might argue that 3D worlds are simply less surprising on the whole in 2020 than in 1993, but that's to ignore the work of countless Doom modders whose creations, made using id's original engine and tools, continue to startle and intrigue today.The missing link in this review is multiplayer, which is offline for the moment, but which already looks like a step up from Doom 2016's ramshackle online. It's a strictly asymmetrical affair, with one player starring as the Slayer while the others control one of five demon breeds from the campaign. As a demon, you can summon AI-controlled hellspawn with the D-pad, so victory is presumably as much about mob strategy as dealing damage yourself. Which sounds like a pleasant way to cool off once you've tired of the sweaty embrace of a campaign that, for all its breaking of Carmack's ancient maxim, has a shot at being one of the best you'll play this year. Still, Doom Eternal leaves me undecided. The game is fundamentally the 2016 reboot again with new props, and its dogged commitment to Doom's narrative universe is as baffling as the firefights are exhilarating. Is this really all Doom can be, nowadays - a cascade of collectables, unwanted cutscenes and the spectacle of a gurning demon face, forever?

Developer: id Software
Publisher: BethesdaMuch like its predecessors, Doom Eternal is a hammer-horror pantomime in which you are made an active participant. It is an elaborate and self-indulgent production, its violence so over the top that you can't help but smile as it spills out over the stage and under your feet. It's an utterly ridiculous and strangely endearing showing, warping your suspension of disbelief so extensively that you'll wonder whether you've crossed over to another dimension – to a world where the first-person shooter followed the archaic directions first outlined by Doom in 1993 without question instead of turning toward the teachings of Half-Life. The problem with this stage show is that the screaming has to stop sometime. The director is hoarse and is begging you to enjoy an intermission from the action. The bullet casings need to be collected, they tell you; the buckets of blood need to be refilled, the gore mopped up, and the guitars tuned back down to D. The cast of cannon fodder needs to take a breather as the next hellish stage is reset somewhere out of sight. You were moving too fast, and there's still a little story left to shout into your face. Doom Eternal is at its worst when it makes you slow down; it struggles to settle in silence. I can count the number of first-person shooters that can function competently as platformers on one hand, and Doom Eternal is not among them. Developer id Software has found itself caught, by attempting to straddle the line between inducing nostalgia and embracing evolution it has disrupted the conditions in which Doom (2016) was able to so effortlessly thrive. Doom Eternal routinely breaks the pace of its action by forcing you to stiffly navigate towering spaces at regular intervals. You'll do this by swinging imprecisely between monkey bars, scaling bland craggy walls, bouncing off of unstable platforms, dashing between spacious maws of death, and double-jumping to ledges with slippery collision detection. Doom's movement systems are tightly refined, designed to keep your crosshairs focused on fast-moving enemies amongst a backdrop of colourful chaos. These systems struggle when you're pushed to slowly and methodically scale the environment with little room for error to reach the next combat arena. It's levels like Doom Hunter Base, Super Gore Nest, and Mars Core that make up the bulk of the mid-game that are hit hardest by this design decision. These spaces are larger and more ambitious than anything the studio has committed to before with Doom, and they struggle to maintain momentum. ""As a prerequisite to progression, platforming only serves to introduce points of friction in an otherwise frictionless experience.""First-person platforming just about works for Doom when it is an optional extravagance – when you're off exploring for the myriad of optional collectable scattered throughout each of the missions – but as a prerequisite to progression they only serve to introduce points of friction in an otherwise frictionless experience. By the time underwater sections were introduced – slowing you down even further, with the added annoyance of mitigating radioactive damage thrown in for good measure – it starts to become difficult to resist the urge to put the controller down and walk away entirely. That all said, it's difficult to indulge in these tendencies when you're faced with the prospect of coming across another sensationally-realised vista or the opportunity to shove the Super Shotgun double-barrel deep into the throat of a Baron of Hell.  That's where Doom Eternal feels right, revelling in ultra-violence across some impossibly beautiful environments. The game has built on the core loop that helped propel its predecessor from mere revival-project to genuine revolution, its central gimmick always working to keep players moving and – critically – engaging with enemies. Glory Kills are still the star of the combat experience. Pumping enemies with enough bullets to reach a damage threshold will make them glow, indicating that you can do some graphic combination of: decapitation / goring / smashing / bashing / slicing / knifing / ripping / tearing (delete as necessary). These melee executions aren't just for show, they serve as your primary method of retrieving health. It encourages you to play Doom Eternal the way id wants you to play it. The studio wants you to be moving and shooting as quickly as you can, giving as much aggression back to the hulking monsters as they give to you. To succeed in Doom Eternal – especially once you begin to whip through the difficulty levels – you must get in the face of enemies and never back away from a tough encounter; there's no faster way to meet your maker than to engage in a half-hearted retreat, with victory earned by engaging with the relentless pace of the action on its own terms – backing off is never an option, carrying through with forward momentum towards piles of ammunition, red barrels, and, yes, fresh enemies to rip and tear through is the key to victory. If you aren't in need of health, you'll find that your Chainsaw can be used to chew through foes and retrieve ammunition, which is always in short supply. Your flame belch, a shoulder-mounted flamethrower, can burn enemies and deliver armour plating when shot, while Glory Kills also charge up your ability to deliver a devastating Blood Punch which eviscerates just about anything within your immediate cone of vision.  All in all, it's a killer cycle that only helps propel Doom Eternal's core combat to new heights.  Speaking of the core combat, it's been a long-standing rule that you judge an id shooter on the strength of its shotguns. Unsurprisingly, the studio has taken its penchant for building the best boomsticks in video games and outdone itself. The Super Shotgun is impossible to put away; it screams power with every shot, its weight and staggering punch as satisfying to use the opening hours of the game to the last.Weapons have always been at the heart of Doom, and Eternal is no slouch in this regard. You'll also find that each of the firearms can once again be upgraded throughout the game with Weapon Points, earned by completing in-mission objectives and chaos thresholds. Most weapons have two available modifications, each of which can be switched up with a simple button press, and offer an array of utterly ridiculous additional ways to turn demons to pulp. Exploring the environments will also help you earn Sentinel Crystals and Praetor Suit points which can be used to upgrade your armour, improving its utility and resistance, or upgrading your health, armour, and ammo capacities.  You'll want to invest in these upgrades and improvements early on, because Doom Eternal isn't afraid to beat your head against the wall until it's a pulpy mess. By the late game, Doom Eternal gets brutal, really pushing you to utilise all of your available abilities and weapons to get through its combat arenas in one piece. For the most part, Doom Eternal casts its action in locked-off combat arenas, pushing you to skirt through them at speed looking for the most violent lines of none-stop navigation. These spaces aren't as tightly designed as the ones featured in Doom (2016), which I believe is down to the increased verticality – id is desperate to get you utilising its first-person platforming systems, even in the middle of frantic fights – but they are still great to engage enemies in. That said, Doom Eternal does suffer because of some of its enemy design. The game is structured around escalating encounters – it introduces you to an enemy type on its own, lets you figure out the hook to slaying it, and then continues to throw a litany of them at you once. It's a potent design that keeps Doom Eternal feeling frantic at all times, with the game's aggressive and persistent AI ensuring that some of these creatures combine tactics to overwhelm you in some truly terrifying ways.  Combat arenas are usually a mixture of Heavy Cannon fodder – foes that can be quickly chewed up or smashed down for an easy burst of ammo or health – and larger, more punishing enemies that'll take a few runs around the arena to drop. This structure maintains momentum, and the relentless pace that the core ethos that the game is built on. Until it makes you slow down. Boss battles with health bars were a blight on Doom (2016), and while that isn't so much of a problem here, there are a handful of enemy types that bring play screeching to a halt. For Doom Eternal to work, it has to have you managing your time between multiple enemy types and constantly leaving you on the verge of being totally overwhelmed, constantly asking you to push your understanding of the movement and combat mechanics to the max. And in comes a Marauder (a brand new demon designed for Eternal) or a returning Archvile, Super Heavy enemies that are generally no fun to fight. The Marauder, in particular, only works to slow combat to a crawl. It's an enemy type designed inherently for one-versus-one encounters, and it doesn't work in the controlled chaos of the wider combat experience. Still, that's a small annoyance in an otherwise blistering FPS. If you can bite your lip and endure some routinely frustrating levels built around platforming, then you're going to have one hell of a good time with Doom Eternal. It's a fast, smart, and frantic shooter that seems to find real delight in testing your endurance. It's an outrageous and ridiculous pantomime where you are bound by blood to the unrelenting cadence of the action. Doom Eternal was reviewed on Xbox One XJosh West is the UK Managing Editor of GamesRadar+.

DOOM Eternal,Andrew Reiner,Game Informer,https://www.gameinformer.com/review/doom-eternal/doom-eternal-review-bloody-brilliant,"Rip. Tear. Celebrate. Doom Eternal is an FPS feast that bombards players with adrenaline-soaked excitement and ridiculous amounts of gore. In this direct continuation to 2016’s reimagining of Doom, developer id Software plays the role of angel and devil, empowering the legendary Doom Slayer with more might, while simultaneously giving the demons more hellish ways to inflict pain. This clashing of titans is a spectacle to behold. Explosions and guts soar across the battlefield as heavy metal pounds to the carnage. No matter who is left standing, the player is the beneficiary of the series’ best combat, which hits an exhilarating fever pitch.The Doom Slayer has always been powerful, but now he’s armed to the teeth with a truckload of gear. He’s carrying eight firearms and can call upon an awesome new shoulder-mounted launcher with a vast array of ammo types. Ranged combat isn’t his only means of destruction, though. The Slayer also has a blade that extends from his arm to yank hearts out of chests, and when things get dire, he can once again whip out the Crucible, which is basically a one-hit lightsaber. The selection of weapons gives players the tools to approach combat from a number of new vectors and change course on the fly, resulting in a deep and strategic experience that kicks like a mule.Given how many enemies stand in the Slayer’s way – not to mention the immense amounts of ammo needed to drop them – his weapons can be depleted in a flash, leaving him with nothing but a noisy chainsaw (which is also a blast to use, especially since it rewards him with ammo for every gun). The combat, as gory as it may be, is beautifully orchestrated, and once again embraces the “push forward” design, meaning you need to keep moving from enemy to enemy in order to survive. Slowing down or ducking behind cover will almost certainly bring death. Even as you dart across the battlefield, demons teleport to your location and you need to drop them quickly to advance to the next dance of death.With its new additions, Doom Eternal is a far more challenging game than its predecessor. That being said, it feels fair and manageable given the firepower you now pack and the numerous ways you can regain slivers of health. Part of the difficulty increase comes from the introduction of new enemy types. While the threat delivered by the pain elemental doesn’t quite live up to its name, the archvile is a serious nuisance that must be dealt with immediately. He spawns enemies everywhere, protects himself with a fire shield, and has a thick hide that can soak up ammo. Most encounters, whether against foes old or new, put up a decent challenge and can be deadly if you are sloppy in your execution.Many adversaries can take a beating, and you can now see it with your own eyes through awesome new cosmetic damage. Each shot picks away at their armor and flesh, and if they look like walking skeletons, they’re surely ready to meet the reaper. This is a fantastic way of showing mid-battle progress, and it looks great.When a foe is about to fall, you see it flash orange or blue, meaning you can execute them with a glory kill. These finishers are as gruesome as they are comical – one demon may be ripped in two, whereas another may have its head smashed into its chest like a whack-a-mole. Glory kills once again serve the role of a much-needed three-second breather that allows players to think about their next move (and also gain a little health back).Much like the 2016 game, the action runs smoothly and is all about pinpoint precision and exploiting enemy weaknesses. The controls are beautifully fashioned, allowing players to quickly switch weapons, toggle between their various firing modes, and dart across the battlefield like a high-flying trapeze.The gunplay may be the bloody centerpiece, but it is accented by greatly enhanced environmental traversal. The player can double jump, dash, latch onto walls, swing from poles, and even use a meat hook (which is fired from the super shotgun) to latch onto an enemy and zoom to its location. Some of these actions are sewn into combat, but when the last demon hits the ground, you will likely be tasked to use them to traverse hazardous terrain – complete with the spinning fireball chains from the Mario games. These sections are excellently designed, and require precise timing and trajectories. The platforming element also comes into play to solve environmental puzzles – perhaps to open a door or reach a new area.Some of these puzzles are flat-out silly and feel out of place in a game like Doom Eternal. The greatest killer in the cosmos apparently has to shoot buttons and push blocks to figure out how to open doors. To ensure players aren’t stumped for long, id even color-coded puzzle elements in glowing green, meaning you don’t really have to put too much brainpower into them. They are more of a nuisance than anything.Doom Eternal is overflowing with secrets to unearth; some are fun collectibles, and others simply flesh out the lore. The most important secrets are upgrades, and there are plenty to track down. Mods once again give your weapons special abilities that you switch to on the fly. For instance, the combat shotgun can fire sticky bombs or turn into a fully automatic weapon. These mods are clever and give each tool of destruction a decidedly different feel. You can also track down tokens to upgrade these mods, again giving you plenty of reason to explore the linear levels fully.The Slayer’s suit can be enhanced for both combat and cosmetic purposes, deepening the gameplay further. It even allows you to tweak the flow of play itself through runes. These powerful stones assist the player in everything from enhanced airborne movement control to slowing time at the brink of death, and much more. All of these upgrade systems make a huge difference.On the multiplayer front, Doom Eternal is a huge step back for the entire series. You can’t deathmatch, make your own maps, and the only option available at launch is an asymmetrical 2v1 experience called Battlemode. It’s basically a game of cat and mouse between a human-controlled Slayer and two human-controlled demons. The Slayer, who has all of his gear from the campaign, is the cat. The battles are frantic, and playing as demons like the Revenant and Mancubus is amusing, but there isn’t much meat on this multiplayer experience’s bones, and it pales in comparison to the series’ other offerings.From a combat standpoint, you couldn’t ask for much more from Doom Eternal. It roars with excitement, and just keeps getting bigger and better as it goes. Yes, it stumbles a little in puzzles, but players are frequently rewarded handsomely for making the efforts to crack them. Id Software made Doom relevant again with the 2016 game, and now the developer is clearly having fun showing players how wild this vision can get.

DOOM Eternal,Phil Hornshaw,GameSpot,https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/doom-eternal-review-in-progress/1900-6417432/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f,"Doom Eternal intensifies the battles with Hell's hordes by requiring you to constantly calculate the best ways to rip, tear, and stay alive.By 
    Phil Hornshaw
   on March 27, 2020 at 7:38AM PDTId Software's return to Doom in 2016 was a phenomenal update of the franchise's classic shooter formula. It was fast and intense, full of huge monsters and scorching metal tracks, modernizing the feel of the 1990s original while adding some new-school flourishes. Where Doom 2016 brought the original Doom into the present, Doom Eternal feels like a big step forward in making the franchise something new: It's a master class in demon dismemberment after the introductory course to ripping and tearing of four years ago. Like its predecessor, Doom Eternal makes you feel like a monster-shredding badass--not just because you're the strongest Doom Slayer, but because you're also the smartest.Doom Eternal is all about effectively using the huge amount of murder tools at your disposal. Health, armor, and ammo pickups are at a minimum in Eternal's many combat arenas, and the game instead requires you to earn these by massacring monsters in a variety of different ways. Stagger an enemy and you can tear them apart with a brutal glory kill, which refills your health; douse a demon with the new flamethrower and they'll start to spout armor pickups; or cut them in half with the chainsaw to grab some much-needed ammo.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Doom Eternal Video ReviewIn order to stay alive, you can't just run around blasting madly, expecting to tear through everything in your path; you have to run around blasting rationally to keep yourself at fighting strength. Keeping all your numbers up means continually rotating through your glory, chainsaw, and flamethrower kills while also making sure you're using the right gun for a particular job. Many of the toughest enemies now have weak points that allow you to snipe off their most lethal weapons, and you'll need to assess threats and knock them out quickly.At first, it seems like Doom Eternal provides an altogether unwieldy list of things to manage. Between all its weapons and tools, their various ammo counters, and your health, it can all become overwhelming. With so much to keep in mind at all times, it takes a bit to get accustomed to Doom Eternal. And constantly pausing the action to pull up your weapon wheel to check ammo counters and decide which weapon to use on the monster about to tear your face off can feel antithetical to Doom's run-and-gun, rip-apart-everything approach.Once you get the hang of it, though, all of Doom Eternal's many elements come together in a cascade of mayhem that makes you into the brainiest killing machine around. This isn't the kind of shooter in which your twitch reactions and aiming skills will carry you through; Eternal is a game in which you have to be constantly plotting your next move, executing a calculus of carnage to keep yourself alive and make everything else dead. Every moment is about analyzing the battlefield to find the next enemy you can stagger and slice apart for health or ammo, figuring out which enemy is your top priority and what guns you'll need to take it out safely, and where you need to head next in order to take the shots you need or keep the creatures chasing you from getting their own chance to rip and tear.The mental math of figuring out how to keep yourself alive is a big part of what makes the game fun, but it's the improved mobility that really lets Doom Eternal kick off a metal guitar solo and start shredding. Every big battle takes place in a multi-level arena adorned with jump pads and monkey bars that let you get around quickly, and you also have a double-jump and horizontal dash move for avoiding attacks and crossing distances. A few arenas have their irritations, especially those where it's easy to trap yourself in a tight corner or back over a cliff, but mostly, Eternal's level design provides plenty of opportunities to zip around like a bat out of hell, constantly finding your next target and assessing if you need to set it on fire, freeze it, cut it in half, tear it apart, or some combination of all of them. It all makes just about every fight feel like a speeding train seconds from going off the rails, with disaster only averted because you're so damn good at killing stuff. Once you get the rhythm of Doom Eternal, it becomes a brilliant extension of what made Doom 2016 so cool.Between battles, you spend your time using Eternal's mobility to navigate its sprawling, twisting levels, and to uncover myriad secret locations that hide upgrades and weapon mods. There's an even bigger emphasis on platforming than in Doom 2016, and puzzling through the environments to get around provides a welcome breather between fights. Some of the platforming can be a bit trying at times, especially when you need to clear big gaps to grab distant monkey bars or hit sticky walls you can climb. For the most part, though, navigating the environment is almost as much fun as smashing through Hell's armies. These portions are also pretty forgiving, thanks to the fact that falling into the abyss now only penalizes you with a small loss of health instead of instant death.The campaign took me around 16 hours to complete, and that included tracking down the vast majority of secrets and completing a lot of the optional fights that earn you additional upgrade points. Running throughout is a pretty involved story, which feels like a fundamental shift from the satirical, jokey tale of Doom 2016. Where that game put you in the Praetor suit of a Doomslayer who literally destroyed the radios trying to provide context for his endless massacres, Doom Eternal is much more self-serious, constantly spewing proper nouns and character names as if you're intimately familiar with all the actors leading Hell's invasion of Earth. Some of the humor of the last game remains, but the majority is all pretty tough to follow if you don't spend time reading through the many collectible lore drops scattered around every level. Thankfully, keeping up with Eternal's confusing plot isn't really a necessary component of enjoying the game.In addition to the main campaign, Doom Eternal also includes a multiplayer mode called Battlemode. It foregoes the more traditional deathmatch approach of Doom 2016, in which a bunch of players grab the Doom Slayer's weapons and shoot each other, for an experience in which one combatant takes on the role of the Slayer, fighting a team of two opponents who play as demons.The Slayer-versus-demons approach of Eternal's multiplayer helps maintain the puzzle-like feel of its combat, while ratcheting up the challenge by giving demons the ability to strategize and work together. Demons also have a bunch of special abilities--they can summon smaller enemies to fight for them, block the Slayer's ability to pick up loot for a short time to stop them from healing, create traps, or share buffs. Battlemode is an interesting take on Eternal's battles, requiring you to use all your skills against intelligent enemies as the Slayer and to execute coordinated assaults as the relatively weaker demons. Playing as the demons puts things at a slower pace but captures a different, more tactical aspect of the battle calculations that are central to Doom Eternal's gameplay.Eternal's multiplayer is a fun change of pace, especially with the opportunity to play as the demons, but its steep learning curve means it's a bit alienating to drop into, particularly if you haven't put significant time into the campaign. There's a lot to keep in mind no matter what role you take on in Battlemode, making it a tough multiplayer experience to get good at. The mode also doesn't add too much variety to the Eternal formula--for Slayer players, it's mostly just a more challenging version of Eternal's campaign. Taking on the demon role lets you try one of five different hellions, but while each plays a little differently, the gist of each is pretty much the same: Summon demons, shoot the Slayer. Battlemode is a nice diversion, but it's not the major draw of Eternal by any stretch, and the novelty of facing off against other humans doesn't add much to the game's underlying formula.Though it can take a bit to get the hang of it, the intricacies of Doom Eternal's combat, combined with its enhanced mobility and option-heavy level design, create a ton of white-knuckle moments that elevate everything that made Doom 2016 work so well. Its combat is just as quick and chaotic, but requires you to constantly analyze everything that's happening in order to come out victorious. Once you get the hang of the rhythm of Doom Eternal, it'll make you feel like a demon-slaying savant. Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"
DOOM Eternal,Chris Plante,Polygon,https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/3/17/21182306/doom-eternal-review-pc-xbox-one-ps4-stadia,"Filed under:Doom Eternal’s power fantasy is funny, playful, and a welcome breakHave you ever noticed how cop procedurals will signal that a messy-haired teenager is a real loner type by showing him playing a video game, sitting in a dark bedroom littered with junk food, the walls covered in heavy metal posters? The game itself (because we always get to see gameplay, even though the show clearly can’t afford good computer animation) appears to be a parody of violent video games, all disembowelment and close-range executions. The teen, played by a 20-something actor, manhandles his poor controller, suggesting the game is either astonishingly complex or the teenager is dumb as a rock. That’s Doom Eternal. All of it. The Mountain Dew and Cheetos. The Dream Theater albums. The hand-cramping controls. And the overwhelming sense that everybody involved is in on the joke, and having a good time. That lack of shame makes all the difference. Polygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences. When we award the Polygon Recommends badge, it’s because we believe the recipient is uniquely thought-provoking, entertaining, inventive, or fun — and worth fitting into your schedule. If you want curated lists of our favorite media, check out What to Play and What to Watch.When you play Doom Eternal (and you should play Doom Eternal), you will see a space marine running and jumping across blood-soaked torture chambers, while shooting, burning, freezing, chainsawing, and generally mangling demons. You move from point A to point B, killing everything in between. Sometimes you need a keycard to open a locked door. Most of the time, you simply need to kill something a little more challenging than the thing you killed in the previous room. The story picks up where Doom (2016) left off: Demons have overtaken Earth. You are a literal one-man army, on the path to becoming either a god or a killer of gods. Your quest to kill three space witches will take you from the aforementioned demon-infested Earth to a demon-infested Mars and back, with some pit stops at your space base, the Fortress of Doom, a hybrid space station and medieval castle floating somewhere (best I can tell) near the moon. Doom Eternal is like Doom (2016) but with greater scope and clearer intent. Doom (2016) infamously fell into development hell, with its developer, id, spending years reimagining the project like a person in a desert chasing after hallucinations before finally locating actual water. Doom (2016) felt like a game that happened despite itself. Doom Eternal, on the other hand, feels purposeful, like every team member had strived for one goal: to turn the magic of death-metal album covers into a video game. Friends, they did it.Everything is more “badass” (and I never say the word “badass”). The super shotgun has a grappling hook that can catch demons on fire. Badass! You can tell how badly a demon is injured by how much skin and muscle you’ve blasted off its skeleton. Badass! Instead of a pistol, you start the game with a shotgun. Badass!Developer id and publisher Bethesda have invested small mountains of money in cutscenes, but even our hero seems bored by them, never saying a word, literally walking through the cinematics, and cutting one-sided conversations short with the occasional bullet to the noggin. He doesn’t have time for all this fantasy lore baloney; he has evil to tear apart. His name is Doomguy. What else can you expect? My inner teenager has a soft spot for the aesthetic, but what makes Doom Eternal special isn’t what you see when you play, but what you feel. And what you feel ... it’s like dancing. The movement is a pleasure. With ease, I’m gliding across the floor and through the air, choosing the best steps to maintain momentum and grace, seamlessly swapping between partners that I twirl, toss, and gut like a fish. It’s a ballet, albeit drenched in viscera and set to crunching guitar riffs. Each room contains bounties of enemies, all of whom unload a variety of punches and smashing attacks, fireballs, and laser beams so quickly that you have no option but to run, firing from the hip at everything that moves. Weak enemies materialize with the regularity of a Slayer song’s drumbeat, which is actually a true blessing. Each demon is a living piñata, spewing health and armor energy when you perform a well-timed melee kill or light them aflame with your shoulder-mounted flamethrower — a new addition to the series. Finding the perfect rhythm of fire, bullets, and melee turns demons into humanoid sprinklers that spurt green and blue tokens, accompanied by a euphoric metallic sound effect that’s similar to a slot machine dropping coins.Rapidly, you meet bigger, stronger, and deadlier enemies that just so happen to be susceptible to whichever new weapon is waiting nearby. A sniper shot or a sticky grenade removes turrets off the spine of a giant, anthropomorphic brain. Heat-seeking rockets chase a teleporting hell ghoul. A turret shield provides a moment to catch your breath in the middle of a fight, while also peeling the flesh off a demon like an orange.On the surface, Doom Eternal is a callback to everything that led the gaming industry to form its own ratings board: a celebration of violence, a fetishization of heavy weapons, and a flirtation with the satanic arts. Under that surface, though, lies an intricate and outstanding feat of balance, an act of creative maturity that suggests years of experience in not merely making this sort of game, but making it look easy. Every option for violence in the game, every weapon and encounter, contributes to the action holistically, like an elaborate upgrade of roshambo. When it clicks for you — when you instinctively know to use a freezing grenade (also new to this entry) to slow a powerful demon, light a creeping horde on fire for its abundance of armor, send a flaming arrow into a flying beast, smash the flaming horde for health, and then cleave the original frozen baddie in half right before it thaws — you feel like Doomguy. And Doomguy feels like a god. It takes a lot of smarts to make something that often sounds stupid while feeling so exhilarating and mentally taxing. That dichotomy of great skill being applied to the absurd adventure of a demon slayer is precisely why I adore Doom as a series. It’s why Polygon named Doom Eternal’s predecessor, which was only called Doom, our game of the year in 2016. The series provides silly, meathead escapism while often concealing the engineering, craftsmanship, artistry, and risk-taking necessary to produce a game that looks this familiar, yet feels fresh.Doom Eternal stands apart from its contemporaries, the big, gaudy, self-serious first-person shooters like Call of Duty and Battlefield that demand instant, microscopic movements to perform headshots in order to survive against preternaturally gifted teens. Competitive players of those franchises grapple with each patch’s meta, while memorizing maps, angles, and weapon advantages. It’s a popular approach to AAA first-person shooter design, but for all the grand scope and spectacle, the “fun” of these shooters largely takes place down the sights of a gun. Only one weapon in Doom Eternal includes a traditional scope, and it’s an optional upgrade. Ammo can be found in the chest cavity of every enemy, so there’s no need to be precious about firing from the hip.In Doom Eternal, the “fun” is in the movement. Because you must restore health and armor with close-range attacks, moving in and out of scrimmages becomes the foundation of winning strategies. A double jump, a double dash, and a hook that pulls you toward its living target all allow you to establish your distance, as do environments sprinkled with walls, hills, tunnels, platforms, and monkey bars — all meant to be used for cover and escape, but also your own amusement.Despite having weapons that can bring instant death to an entire room, you can’t survive exclusively by playing aggressively, because one wave of enemies typically gives way to another wave, and then another. A good fight requires constant decision-making: which weapon to use against which enemy, what ammo to conserve, when to mine weak demons for health, and when to rip out the biggest enemy’s soul.Between the dozens of action set-pieces, id has added a bunch of platforming sequences that are fine. They’re just fine. Listen: In most cases, first-person platforming in video games feels like a crime, but I rarely felt frustrated when jumping across hundred-foot chasms at supercar speeds. For the most part, the platforming exists to showcase the gargantuan environments, moving the franchise far outside its roots in claustrophobic corridors. Doom Eternal understands scope, and is willing to go big to hammer home the fact that the demons are a legitimate threat to the planet, not just to a dimly lit moon base or spaceship.  The game struggles only when something forces you to stop.One stage in Doom Eternal’s midsection hews closely to the Call of Duty formula, favoring cramped, linear hallways and floors covered in purple goo that literally slows the action, preventing the all-important dashing and jumping. The recurring joke about demons being “mortally challenged” is a buzzkill, knocking the smile off my face every single irritating time it’s delivered. And then the final third of the game introduces swimming. On dry land, Doom Eternal is an improvised dance. Underwater, the game devolves into pin the tail on the donkey. Movement while swimming is stilted. It’s hard to see. And the only goal is to fumble about in search of the right glowing target to smash, hoping it will bring an end to the supposedly fun distraction. Late stages sometimes trade the skate park-style arenas of the early acts for large, simple open spaces larded with tons of boss-tier demons. On a few occasions, an adrenaline-fueled run came to a full stop when I found myself stuck between a few large enemies and the world’s geometry, unable to run, jump, or dash. I was stuck, helpless, waiting to die. One enemy, the Marauder, requires singular focus, more akin to a Dark Souls flavor of combat. This encounter would be fine on its own, but, like all of the game’s flaws, it brings the momentum to a joyless halt. Yes, the second half has its blemishes (or, to go back to our dancing metaphor, its missteps). And that’s reasonable. Doom Eternal has one of the strongest, leanest, and most confident first halves of any action game, or really, any big-budget game ever. But let me be clear: This isn’t the point in the review where I tell you the second half is a disappointment. It’s not. It’s great, and at times near perfection. You know, the times when it’s not asking me to swim in poisonous acid to unlock another door.I want to tell you more, especially about the developer’s generosity of design. All the cheat codes you can unlock, the toys you can collect, the fortress you can decorate and explore. I’d love to spoil all of it, but I won’t. You should discover the specifics on your own.Treat Doom Eternal like dessert — something to be savored, not hurried. When you have the rare moment between feeding one demon its own heart and breaking another demon’s arm and hammering the freshly protruding bone through the demon’s skull, take a breath to admire the engineering and artistry that makes your actions possible, how the world encourages playful movement, how the specific design of an arena and the placement of each enemy invites you to chain your violence in one ecstatic flourish. Always be moving, but never rush.Lee Ann Womack put it best: I hope you dance.

This followup to id Software’s no-nonsense 2016 revamp of that most seminal first-person shooter franchise takes a more-is-more approach to building on the brutal elegance of its predecessor. That means more mobility, more demons, more weapon mods and upgrades, more resource management… The list could go on and on, and frankly it's hard to think of a single aspect of Doom 2016 that hasn't been absolutely red-lined in this sequel.That kind of escalation is arguably appropriate for a franchise as over-the-top and self-awarely absurd as Doom, but there are just so many pistons and gears whirring away under the hood here that you sometimes start to feel them grinding against each other a little when the action heats up. But then, when all the machinery is humming along just right and everything works in harmony, Doom Eternal offers some of the most frantic and overwhelming shooter action in history.The 2016 Doom reboot, or reimagining, or whatever you want to call it, left such a profound impression on me that I can't help filtering my thoughts about Eternal through a direct comparison. The sequel picks back up with the same template--shoot demons to kill them, chainsaw them when you need ammo, rip them in half when you need health, double-jump and mantle away from them when you need breathing room--and then builds outward in every conceivable direction. There's now a flamethrower that works for armor the way the chainsaw does for ammo. You get not one but two types of grenades, concussive and freeze, that you can rapidly toggle between. Your basic melee turns into an area-of-effect ""blood punch"" when you charge it up with enough of the health-yielding glory kills. All of these have meters and cooldowns to keep an eye on in the corners of the UI.In addition, the two new elements that have the biggest impact on the flow of the combat are the double dash and the addition of weak points on heavier enemies that let you suppress their deadlier attacks. Much like the double jump, the dash lets you pop off two quick horizontal movements in any direction, on the ground or in the air, which has obvious implications for getting around the combat space quickly. And dealing with the weak points is crucial for threat management. Blowing off the mancubus' arm cannons or the back-mounted gun on the arachnotron, or shoving a sticky bomb down the gullet of a cacodemon, is an immediate priority whenever those enemies come on the scene, purely because of how dangerous those attacks are and how urgent it is to disable them as a result. Both of these are great ideas on paper that add to the variety of the action early on in the campaign (although the game does have a penchant for utilizing the air dash in occasional jumping puzzles that aren't really its strong suit).This full loadout of new and old abilities offers you an amazing range of tactical options in a heavy firefight, and in an ideal setting, such as the Slayer Gate challenge arenas that constitute the purest and most intense combat sequences in the game, they lead to a level of intensity that's above and beyond possibly any other first-person shooter I've played. I honestly found myself short of breath at the end of a couple of the Slayer Gates, after 10 frantic minutes of feeling like I was just barely hanging on before finally eking out a victory. But at the speed Doom Eternal runs at, it can be easy to forget you have some of those abilities at your disposal, or lose track of which ones are off cooldown, when the game is forcing you to make one split-second decision after another. The dash is fantastic for getting you around an arena quickly, but you can also find yourself dashing back into a corner without meaning to and getting boxed in by enemies, or dashing into one of the many monkey bars scattered around the levels, accidentally diverting yourself midair. And quickly popping off those weak point shots becomes a matter of survival the more enemies the game throws at you, which can cause things to spin out of control rapidly when you miss more than a couple of times.All this means that playing Doom Eternal felt like a series of highs and lows rather than the 20-plus-hour nonstop high I expected. At its best, the game is a breakneck, exhilarating, barely controllable dance of damage output, maneuvering, crowd control, and leapfrogging resource management, and it's so much fun when everything is working sublimely that it's all the more jarring when one aspect of it or another feels like it gets in the way. I suspect that some of this, especially the issue with weak points, comes down to the way I played Doom Eternal, which was on a PlayStation 4 Pro on Ultra-Violence (i.e. hard). That's also how I played through Doom 2016, and I emerged from that experience confidently declaring it one of the best shooters ever made. So I felt I had to apply the same benchmark to Eternal, which in the last handful of hours felt tougher to play well on a controller than its predecessor. Analog sticks aren't as well suited as a mouse to nailing the small moving targets (including literal headshots in a late-game boss fight) that you need to hit reliably to survive, and there are so many abilities and toggles mapped to face buttons that taking your thumbs off the sticks at the wrong time, and thus losing the ability to move or aim or both for even a split second, can be flat out deadly late in the game. That's hardly to say Eternal is unplayable on consoles, but I just felt more at ease with the game's specific mechanics and requirements in the hours I spent playing it on PC, even on Nightmare. Frankly I can admire the audacity of making a shooter so demanding that it almost feels like it requires a mouse at higher difficulties, and in hindsight that's how I wish I'd played it, but at any rate it's something to be aware of depending on your choice of platform.That's a lot of words about the pure combat experience of Doom Eternal, but there's a ton of other stuff built around that core action. There's now a hub area, which is a literal gothic-sci-fi castle floating in space, that you return to in between levels. This home base helps act as a wrapper for the game's numerous upgrade systems, which initially look like a lot to take in but are really no more complex or unmanageable than those in Doom 2016. Weapon mods (which there are more of) can still be upgraded and then put through mastery challenges to unlock their ultimate forms. Passive upgrades, which fall into two categories, enhance your movement, various damage resistances, grenade attributes, and so forth. And the runes from the previous game also return as a sort of perk system, letting you equip three really meaningful bonuses at any one time from a pool of things like a last-stand chance to regain some health when you ""die,"" increased range on glory kills, and slowing down time when you use a weapon mod in the air. To the game's credit, as punishing and sometimes irksome as I found some of the later levels, it did force me to reexamine the rune loadout I had settled into using for most of the game, and changing things up there made a big difference in how I got through a couple of the rougher spots.It still seems improbable even now, but somehow Doom 2016 had a hilariously self-aware story--about the corporate exploitation of Hell and the Doom guy's ferocious dispensation of divine justice--that felt like it walked a fine line between being extremely serious and not remotely serious. The key to that balance was the overt disdain the player character himself displayed for everything going on around him, but here, the Doom guy is a more willing and eager participant in a much wider ranging story that features demon priests, spectral warrior kings, a fallen interdimensional empire, and an array of other elements that feels like it's attempting to build up a quantity of elaborate, faux-Biblical lore. I did enjoy the game's take on the clash between Heaven and Hell and its unusual conception of a celestial host pulling strings behind the scenes, but what felt like a wry commentary on man's arrogance and greed in the first game has taken a backseat to straight up backstory here, an attempt to create something akin to a Doom cinematic universe which fills in some blanks from the previous game that I would have rather remained unfilled.One way that Eternal certainly brings it just as strongly as the 2016 game did is in the sights and sounds. Where the previous game's setting was pretty much limited to a generic sci-fi facility, the red sands of Mars, and a couple of expeditions into Hell, Doom Eternal sends you all over the place to multiple hotspots on the demon-occupied Earth, several locations in the interdimensional outworld, and deep into the bowels of Hell's most insidious strongholds. Eternal's art design feels like it recognizes and embraces its adolescent roots, and some of the late-game levels in particular offer some really gnarly, fire-and-brimstone depictions of infernal human suffering that land somewhere between Milton and Iron Maiden. The graphical fidelity is still top notch and the game still runs smooth as butter, even on consoles, and I have to give special credit to the location-specific damage tech in this game. Having enemies take damage exactly where you shoot them might seem like old hat these days, but Doom Eternal takes it to such an absurd degree that it really stands out when you peel big, meaty chunks of flesh off the bigger enemies with every blast of the super shotgun, and by the time you're almost done with bruisers like the hell knight, they can half look like a bloody skeleton still chasing you around. Focusing on that kind of tech feels like another fun throwback to the days of shooter engine one-upmanship, when games like Soldier of Fortune II put that kind of thing right on the back of the box.The previous Doom's multiplayer options were perfunctory at best, and here Eternal improves significantly with the new Battlemode, a round-based, asymmetric two-on-one versus mode with two players taking control of a demon, including the mancubus, revenant, and arch-vile, and the third playing as the Doom marine with his full bag of tricks from the campaign. Each demon type has a range of unique special abilities (some of which let you spawn other heavy demons in), and the arena is also populated with plenty of AI fodder enemies, which means the Doom guy player can really have their hands full. And both sides get to choose from a handful of perks as the rounds progress that enhance certain abilities or change the flow of combat. I found Battlemode more engaging playing as the Doom marine, though it seems like the more time you spent with the demons the more you'd get a feel for using their abilities to really muck things up for the third player. Throwing a couple of human players into the enemy mix is a clever way to further intensify the game's already complex and varied combat model, and I actually wouldn't mind going back to Battlemode now and then, which is more than I could say for Doom 2016's multiplayer.One thing I can say without reservation about Doom Eternal is that it's ambitious as hell. The devs at id weren't content to just pop out a new set of levels with one new weapon and a couple of enemies (which, ironically, is how the original Doom II came about). Instead they included an enormous roster of new ideas both obvious and unexpected, and took these additions and enhancements to over-the-top extremes. Eternal may not have quite the same purity of focus as its predecessor, but it's so relentless about throwing everything in its toolbox at you at a thousand miles an hour that it's often hard to stop and notice.

DOOM Eternal,Heather Alexandra,Kotaku,https://kotaku.com/doom-eternal-the-kotaku-review-1842471145,"2016’s Doom reimagined the classic shooter into a frantic but modern mold. The bloody escapades of the Doom Slayer were rife with bullets and guts. It was a grimy video game hamburger. Doom Eternal is bigger and bloodier, almost to the point of excess. It’s the same hamburger dipped into a vat of delicious special sauce. Except the serving size is so big that it’s hard not to feel a little sick afterwards.Nonetheless Doom Eternal is incredible. It is a hellaciously bold step forward from the soft-rebooted series that will satisfy even the stodgiest of old school Doom fans. If you want to rip and tear, there’s arguably no better place than Doom Eternal. It also wants to juggle too many balls. There are additions to the combat system, a slew of unlockable items, online multiplayer pitting man against demons, dozens of gun upgrades, a lot more ancient lore, and story connections to older games that offer surprising revelations. Doom Eternal operates on a single maxim: more, more, more. Much of this works, some of it is a harmless annoyance, and a few things are actively frustrating. The frustrating parts don’t prevent Doom Eternal from being a great game, but they are there. They show themselves with every tutorial pop-up, cosmetic reward, or late addition to the game’s fabulous but increasingly busy combat.Does it matter if most players are just here for violence and good times, as opposed to all that other stuff? Probably not. Doom Eternal lives by the strength of its shooting, and with a few notable competitors like Titanfall 2, there’s nothing that comes close to delivering this level of excitement. Doom Eternal is set two years after 2016’s Doom. Earth has been invaded by demonic legions who have wiped out most of the population. These forces are led by a strange angel-like being called the Khan Maykr and a trio of “Hell Priests” that are responsible for summoning and empowering the horde. The Doom Slayer, our ever-helmeted and mindlessly violent hero, returns to Earth to hunt down the Hell Priests and put an end to the invasion. His quest will take him through multiple dimensions and reveal secrets about the life he lived before he became a legendary warrior. Narratively, Doom Eternal has more going on than what came before. The lines between legend and reality become less blurred, and closely guarded secrets and plots get revealed in the process. Who is the Doom Slayer? What really fuels “argent energy,” the seemingly infinite power supply that corporations sought in the previous game, which the Khan Maykr also seems to covet? If you somehow wanted answers to those questions, Doom Eternal’s story will deliver them, and it will do so with a clumsy confidence.The premise is the same as ever: there are demons that need killing and countless ways for you to fuck them up beyond recognition. Doom Eternal contains the same core combat loop as 2016’s Doom. Wounding enemies will cause them to flash into a vulnerable state during which they can be annihilated with a “glory kill.” These astoundingly violent finishing moves, a canonization of Brutal Doom’s fatalities, cause enemies to explode in a burst of blood and health pickups. You dart around, injure enemies, zoom in, smash their skulls in to keep your health up, bust out and keep killing. It’s hard to understate how satisfying this core combat loop is. There is just enough strategy at play. Should I waste time weakening zombie fodder so I can get some easy health back or keep focusing on that Arachnotron chasing me? Should I use my chainsaw now, cutting an enemy in half and gaining ammo pickups in the process, or save it until I have enough gasoline to bisect tougher enemies in the blink of an eye? This satisfying loop congeals into something that’s both incredibly deep and mind-numbingly simple. Sometimes you methodically choose foes, sometimes you bust out your rocket launcher and blow everything into sticky goo.2016’s Doom combat was a straightforward but deliberate dance. Doom Eternal transforms it into an elbow-throwing pit mosh, building upon its core loop by adding on a variety of tools and tactics. These options are sometimes overwhelming. As more and more upgrades are unlocked, combat bloats with possibilities. It can be hard to track all your options when you’re getting bum-rushed by a Baron of Hell or blasted by a Mancubus. However, using these options to their full advantage can crank combat up ten to twenty points on the dial.First and foremost is the addition of the Flame Belch, a short flamethrower attack that causes minuscule damage but has one key benefit: any enemy lit on fire will generate armor when shot or killed. It’s easy to dismiss the Flame Belch as a useless gizmo when you first acquire it. Glory kills make health generation easy and while Doom Eternal is a more difficult game than its predecessor, the early levels are relatively tame. There’s not an overwhelming need for armor when you’re already incredibly mobile and can rip gargoyles in half for a health-restoring blood shower. As the game progresses, the Flame Belch proves more useful. Enemies grow more aggressive and their compositions hold dangerous elite monsters. Learning to douse minor enemies in flames and blow them into armor-granting bits becomes much more essential. It’s a welcome tool, although it does highlight what’s bound to be a point of conversation and contention between players: is there too much stuff?Because, to reiterate, there is a hell of a lot of stuff. In addition to the Flame Belch, players have access to frag and ice grenades that can blow up clusters of enemies or freeze them in place. Each weapon has two different variations that can be unlocked. The Heavy Cannon, a reliable machine gun, can fire miniature missiles or be used as a sort of sniper rifle. The Plasma Rifle can be upgraded with a powerful explosive wave ability or a lock-on microwave beam that blows enemies up when they die. There are runes to discover that unlock permanent powers, like the ability to slow down time when you aim in the air or increase your dash speed. Enemies have weak points on their body that are best handled by specific weapons and firing modes. Is that cacodemon opening their mouth? Better fire a grenade from your modified shotgun. That angelic priest is firing from a distance? You can instantly kill them with a Heavy Cannon precision bolt shot to their skull. Doom Eternal is awash in upgrades, modifications, and options that complicate the combat loop. On the one hand, these options grant players a variety of ways to deal with enemies. The possibility space is wider; you always have something available to deal with a specific threat and you’re given carte blanche to employ the tactics you want. This turns combat into a truly expressive experience, even if you’ll often find yourself relying on key tactics to deal with specific foes.  ""No, John. You are the demons.""Doom. Just Doom.Damn, the combat rules. Level design and pacing are improved over 2016's Doom. How about those Marauders?Please Collect Two More Suit Upgrade Points To Unlock The ""Disliked"" Sectionid SoftwarePS4 (Played), PC, Xbox One, Google StadiaMarch 20, 2020Completed in about twelve hours on Hurt Me Plenty. Immediately started a fresh Ultra-Violence playthrough and am enjoying immensely. That sounds good, right? It is, but these flourishes and additions don’t come without complications, and at times, Doom Eternal’s combat feels almost too busy. The core loop that drove 2016’s Doom to success is occasionally lost in all of the cooldowns, subweapons, and supercharged “Blood Punches.” The special sauce oozes over the hamburger so much that you sometimes lose the beef’s flavor. I expect some disagreement on this point, but while I never begrudged Doom Eternal’s additions, I’d be lying if I said that I didn’t occasionally lose track of when my ice grenades were off cooldown. This problem is fixed in the moments when Doom Eternal demands the most of the player. In choice encounters, you’ll exhaust all your dashes and double jumps, fling a grenade on Flame Belch’d enemies for armor shards and grapple into an enemy’s face with your super shotgun’s meat hook attachment. If you’re playing on the default difficulty, these moments of intense performance aren’t as common as they should be. Doom Eternal takes time before it diversifies the enemy pool; the opening of the game is particularly tame. I found myself craving the moments where I could unlock Slayer Gates, which are hidden challenges featuring devilish monster groupings with boss enemies thoroughly mixed in for good measure. If you’re a Doom aficionado, it’s best to crack the difficult up right away if you want to get the most out of the combat. Doom works best when it is mean. It shines brightest in the moments that it follows in the footsteps of WADs like The Plutonia Experiment, or even John Romero’s recent Sigil.All of this expressed in a single enemy new to Doom Eternal: the Marauder. Marauders are the most “modern” feeling enemy in the game, to the point that they could be right at home in an action game like Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. Marauders pose a unique challenge. Get too close and they will instantly blast you with their shotgun. Move too far away and they slice energy waves at you with their massive axe. When they want to be extra annoying, Marauders can summon a wolf-spirit to chase down the player. Their design bucks against the norm. Doom challenges are usually all about the player needing to be aggressive, but Marauders can only be attacked during key windows of opportunity, else they block everything with a powerful shield. Fighting one-on-one is busy enough. Drop one of these bastards into a horde and an encounter becomes truly difficult. Lord help you if there’s an arch-vile around who might revive fallen minions as well. Compared to older enemies like charging Hell Knights and soul-spewing Pain Elementals, Marauders feel over-tuned and arguably out of place. If Doom Eternal has “too many notes,” then these bastards are an entire symphony unto themselves. Nevertheless, it works..Bosses, on the other hand, never reach such lofty heights. This is especially true with the final two boss battles. There’s little strategy involved in them except shooting at a slightly bigger enemy, and while that arguably makes sense for Doom, the results are boring. The sights are grand and there’s plenty of blood bits, but it never feels as complex or gratifying as it should. Difficulty comes through waves of minions and hazards that limit where you can move. Instead of monumental battles with titans, these are confusing and messy showdowns with foes you don’t really give a shit about. You’ll die, sure, but rarely at their hands. Usually, a spare imp or strange angelic priest will swoop in through a blindspot. That’s Doom Eternal’s combat, for good and ill. Loud, busy, and excessive regardless of the consequences. You either fall in line or get gibbed.This is also apparent in the game’s multiplayer “Battlemode,” a one-versus-two match in which one player is the Doom Slayer and the other two play as demons. It’s often a fun challenge but the fact that Doom Eternal pushes this forward as the main multiplayer option and not simply a deathmatch mode is puzzling. In Battlemode, the two players who are demons get to team up with AI enemies so that the Doom Slayer can perform glory kills to earn health or chainsaw for ammo. But the chaos, while occasionally fun, started to bore me after a handful of matches. It’s another case where more doesn’t mean “better.” There’s also a Dark Souls-esque invasion mechanic—to be released in a post-launch patch—that will let players “invade” someone’s story campaign as a demon and try to take them out. That sounds cool on paper, and while I’m sure it might be fun from time to time, I also find myself scratching my head at it. To paraphrase my bud Adam Jensen: nobody asked for this. I admire the attempts to experiment with the Doom format, but I can’t muster any excitement for what that experimentation has ended up looking like in Doom Eternal’s multiplayer. Doom 2016’s deathmatch modes were met with derision on release, but sometimes all you want to do is drop into a free-for-all. The classics are classic for a reason. You can have your Battlemode, Bethesda. But I’d also like the option to simply jump into arena with some people and some fuckin’ guns, y’know?The idea of “more” somehow being better is the culprit behind Doom Eternal’s most exhausting decisions. . The things I like the least about Doom Eternal are the wrappings surrounding combat. On the mild end of the spectrum, that means the excessive upgrade trees and weapon modifications. Sometimes a shotgun should just be a shotgun. But in Doom Eternal, it’s all about the upgrades. This happened in 2016’s Doom as well, but there’s way more of it here. You’ll gain upgrades for your guns. You’ll gain upgrades to your power suit. You’ll gain upgrades for your runes. You’ll gain upgrades for your punches. There’s fast travel for exploring levels and a base to explore between missions. These additions feel unnecessary and sometimes pointless. I was never excited to find an upgrade hidden in a secret location. It always felt like a chore when I earned upgrade points or found energy cells to unlock one of the many locked doors in my home base. It’s one thing for Doom Eternal’s combat to churn with options; it’s more annoying when everything around it also feels so busy. For a game about blowing shit up, there’s a lot of menu navigation. In the worst cases, there are pop ups about how to unlock such-and-such feature and even messages on how to defeat bosses. Many of these notifications can be disabled, but the associated web of collectables, progression systems, unlockable skins, and bonuses is harder to ignore and it adds little that’s worthwhile to the experience.Doom Eternal’s story is muddy and not told well. World-shaking stakes and brutal displays of villainy mix with a presentation that is disjointed and assumes far more investment on the part of the player than will likely exist. While die-hard fans might be content to speculate about the true nature of cyborg scientist Samuel Hayden and the nature of Doom’s cosmology, the fact of the matter is that it’s just not interesting.Doom Eternal takes the lore of 2016’s Doom—which mostly entailed hazy religious texts and legends of the near-mythical Doom Slayer—and makes everything more explicit. It confirms a fan theory. The Doom Slayer isn’t just anyone; it turns out that he’s the hero from the original Doom, Doom 2, and Doom 64. Following those games, he wandered Hell until he was found by the Maykrs and eventually joined an ancient order of demon slayers called the Night Sentinels. The Maykr society faced upheaval and a mysterious hooded-man imbued him with otherworldly strength.What does all this lore add to the proceedings? It’s hard to say. Doom Eternal drips with an unearned self-seriousness. It bends and twists to weave a larger canon without any real purpose besides adding artificial weight to the story. Where MachineGames reimagined Wolfenstein’s B.J. Blazkowicz into a world-weary soldier and used its Nazi-packed setting to mix pulp and social commentary, Doom Eternal begs to be taken seriously without any real reason to oblige.You can’t have your cake and eat it too, and Doom Eternal shifts between far-out Heavy Metal hijinks and storied lore without combining the two into a coherent package. It’s easy to say that this doesn’t matter. After all, Doom’s all about the shooty times. But 2016’s Doom proved that it was possible to have all the zombie-smashing you wanted while weaving in a few interesting ideas. The Union Aerospace Corporation’s thoughtless dash to harvest Hell energy to fuel technological progress was tinged by real-life concerns about global warming, allowing Doom to develop a pointed if straightforward satire of corporate culture. Lore codexes filled with ancient legends of the Doom Slayer painted a meta-texual story about Doom’s cultural cachet. The franchise might as well be a religion to some players. Why not make that explicit within the fiction? Those things worked as spice adding a light but never superficial kick to a straightforward shooter story. Doom Eternal’s world of Hell Priests, ancient Betrayers and warrior orders ultimately feels hollow. It’s not silly or self-aware enough to take lightly. But I also can’t take it seriously and won’t let the grand twist of the Doom Slayer’s identity sucker me into thinking that there’s more going on here than there actually is.This said, the campaign itself is remarkably well-paced. The middle segments drag somewhat but Doom Eternal’s levels and world design ramp up in quality with each passing segment. 2016’s Doom had one glaring sin: it was too long and too drab. Dank steel hallways eventually gave way to Hell’s brownish tones and increasingly bloated combat encounters. Embracing the lore might not work for Doom Eternal’s narrative, but it works wonders for the world design. There are crumpling cities and demon-packed battles through strip malls, Hell valleys littered with wreckage of giant robots and aging titan corpses, a battle through space as massive laser cannons blaze through the stars, and forays into alien dimensions that feel lifted from Destiny. The levels are more imaginative and varied than what came before. In stark contrast to 2016’s Doom, the back half is actually far better than the start. Combat intensity peaks, guns shattering through ancient courtyards and demon sieged skyscrapers. Doom is a series full of iconic levels. Top tier level design and player-creation have allowed for its longevity, unlike other franchises that fizzled out over time, like Turok or F.E.A.R. . I’m happy to say that many of Doom Eternal’s levels—though far from competing with old-school classics—still kick ass. I won’t forget them any time soon.All of this is pulled together by some of the best sound design I’ve heard in a game. Shotguns blast with a chunking clunk, skulls split with slimey slices. Energy weapons rev and thrum with terrifying power, and demons screech with ferocious roars. Weapons in Doom Eternal don’t always have the sense of impact that you might expect, but they certainly sound as powerful as they should. Underneath all of this is a brilliant soundtrack by composer Mick Gordon. The low moments pulse with an uneasy bass and battles explode with intense guitar pounding. I appreciate Doom Eternal’s combat and often found myself enraptured by its vistas, but if there is a singular thing for which it should be recognized, it is the sheer quality of the soundscape.Doom Eternal’s philosophy is simple: make the most intense experience possible. That mostly works out. Combat, while occasionally busy, is sure to satisfy even the most voracious of shooter-mavens. The ripping and tearing is as good as it has ever been. There are a few sticking points— a shaky story that’s hard to engage with, the few moments when style trumps substance, a glitch here and there—but there’s no denying that the highs are among the highest you can experience in any first-person shooter. Crank up the difficulty, throw your elbows around, and embrace the chaos. From the deepest diehards to fresh-faced demon slayers, there’s something for everyone to enjoy. Blood, guts, music, mayhem. You might get the occasional bloody nose or interrupted by an unwanted tutorial pop-up, but there’s nothing else like it."
DOOM Eternal,Mike Williams,USgamer,https://www.usgamer.net/articles/doom-eternal-review,"
I just leaped at a pole, swung, span 180 degrees and fired a sticky grenade into a cacodemon’s mouth before hitting the floor. When it exploded I dashed forward, jumped, swung again, and stabbed that fucker in its bulging eyeball. All of this happened fluidly, in one smooth motion, in the space of a few seconds. So why, oh why, do I keep accidentally punching every computer terminal, door, and switch I see? In most games, interact being on the same button as something else would be a complete no-no. Remember jumping whenever you tried to open a chest in Dragon Age: Inquisition? Bad. No. Stop that immediately, developers. Stop it now. In Doom, it’s good actually. Hear me out... Interact is on the same button as punch in Doom Eternal, just as it was in Doom 2016, and it means you’re constantly smacking things by accident. I love it. It’s completely in character for Doom Slayer to punch inanimate objects like an angsty teen. In fact, at one point, the game gave me an achievement for punching a gate. That’s because id Software, for the most part, understands what gives Doom its own identity in a world filled with samey first-person shooters. Doom Eternal is self-aware - angry with a cheeky wink. Combat is about pushing forward instead of holding back, running at the thing that’s killing you and using it as a resource, taking what you need from its bloodied corpse... if those chunks of meat can be called a corpse. It’s about meticulously designed arenas that you can navigate backwards at breakneck pace, always shooting. Doom Slayer is rage personified - a mute Kratos, an agent of blind vengeance who doesn’t listen to anyone. He can punch a gate if he wants to. The game welcomes it. Hell, so does the gate. It’s an honour. This sequel is about delivering more of that stuff you loved, faster than before. You don’t even start with a pistol this time - there isn’t one. It starts with a short cutscene and you’re straight into Hell on Earth with a shotgun loaded and ready to go. Within the first hour, your shotgun has a detachable grenade launcher and a rapid fire mod, and you can freely switch between the two with a button tap. You also have an assault rifle, which itself has a scope and rocket silo you can swap out mid-battle. Then there’s your shoulder-mounted grenade launcher. The dial starts at 9 and turns up to 999, I need a doctor. Most of the weapons you find are floating pickups that you run over, automatically pick up, admire, then unload on a demon within seconds. It drip feeds new enemies, new tools, and new tactics constantly. Everything is faster than before.As well as your arsenal, there are a variety of runes you can equip to tweak your gameplay style, and you can have three active at a time. My preference is one that speeds Doom Slayer up after executing a Glory Kill - those gory finishers you can trigger after sufficiently damaging an enemy - another that allows me to snap to Glory Kill target from further away, and one more that slows down time if I hold alt fire in mid-air. These three runes let me dictate the flow. 

If I’m under assault, I can zoom-snap to a damaged target to take advantage of the invincibility frames of a Glory Kill more easily - as ever, these kills provide you with health that spills from your enemy’s mutilated body. Once I’ve done that, my movement speed doubles for a few seconds, allowing me to create some distance - fair warning, this game is fast anyway and this makes it feel like you’re controlling a Bugatti. When the speed throws off my aim, I can run into a bounce pad, fly into the air, hold alt fire, and rain down a missile barrage in bullet-time. The ability to control the pace adds a lot, giving you the space to put on the brakes and assess the situation on the fly: which demons to prioritise, where to aim, what weapon to use, and where to head to keep yourself out of the firing line without getting boxed in. It’s astounding how many different enemies there are, and how various combinations of enemy types change the feel of each encounter. Whenever you see a cacodemon flying nearby, your first instinct is to deal with it quickly. If they get close, they can corner you and tear at you with vicious bites. A single grenade in the mouth - either from your shotgun alt fire or your shoulder-mounted launcher - will prep them for a Glory Kill, but you might forget the other demons all around you as you adjust your aim to the skies. Fortunately, the new tool attached to the super shotgun, the meat hook, lets you take the aerial advantage yourself by grappling and pulling yourself towards an enemy. You can combine that with the aforementioned rune to slow time to a crawl, creating heroic moments where you take to the skies, time slows, you land a meaty headshot, and things instantly go back to seat-of-your pants mayhem as you land. The core gunplay of Doom has never felt as good as this. The new demon degradation system adds heft to each shot, with every bullet searing the flesh from your foes. Now we’re ripping and tearing, and not just when we’re splitting a demon in half with our hands. I also can not understate how satisfying the new sound effect is for exploding heads, like a kid popping their cheek with their finger. Pop! The sound design marries the gunfeel to extraordinary effect here, and this is backed by Mick Gordon’s ear-pounding soundtrack, now with added heavy metal choir. It all combines to put you in the zone, an all-encompassing experience that’s best enjoyed with headphones. Like those cacodemon gobs, each enemy has a weak point and you can reduce their effectiveness by taking advantage of these achilles tendons. Hop over a charging pinky, spin around and shoot its tail. Blast the guns straight off a cyber mancubus, or wade in with a Blood Punch, smack one, and strip its armour in one move. Snipe the turret from an arachnotron. Fire the plasma rifle to explode energy shields, damaging any dumb demon stood nearby. There’s a tool and tactic for each enemy type, as there was in Doom 2016, but now there’s more nuance to it - you have to switch your brain so you’re calculating kills like a murderous supercomputer. Even other new tweaks like the flame belch - a short burst of fire from a shoulder-mounted weapon - adds a layer to encounters. Set a group of enemies aflame and every bit of damage you do will make them bleed armour shards, topping you up. Glory Kills for health, flame belch for armour, and your chainsaw is right there to cut demons open for ammo. A new melee weapon called the Crucible Blade unlocks later on, giving you the chance to insta-kill most enemies, though it has limited uses and needs constantly topping up. The BFG also makes a return, though it’s now on the radial weapon menu rather than being this devastating smart bomb with its own dedicated panic button. This works fine for the most part, though the fact you auto switch to your last used weapon when you run out of ammo does occasionally lead to you accidentally firing it and wasting this rare resource. As well as expanding your arsenal, id Software has opened up the levels in Doom Eternal. Doom 2016 was criticised at launch for its predictable structure, where players moved from corridor to arena, corridor to arena. Here the arenas feel more organic, like part of an environment. They’re more open, more layered, and there are more routes through them and more environmental hazards to take into account. They are large enough and with enough routes through to feel boundless, yet still flowing. These spaces have edges, of course, but they fit into the environment in more natural ways. Portals, swing bars, and bounce pads make for interesting routes through them. And sometimes the game offsets those large arenas by spawning in a demon in close quarters, forcing you to adapt and think fast before the situation gets away from you. There’s much more visual variety here as well. You’ll walk across the weapons of long-dead titans, and into the chest cavity of a murdered giant. You’ll traverse lakes of molten lava, ascend to the heavens, look out into space, and see Hell on Earth both from ruined cities and the Arctic - literally Hell frozen over. Interiors are extravagant and interconnected, packed with fine details: statues with gold inlays, reflective materials shimmering in the light, elaborate door mechanisms, and mechanical contraptions snapping and whirring into place. It’s a visual step up, a Doom with a view. The story that plays out across this journey is also stronger. It lays it on thick with optional lore, there are many more cutscenes, and it gets across more of Doom Slayer’s character, tying modern Doom to its past and creating an expanded Doomiverse. You’ll travel to places with names like “Terrordome”, “Super Gore Nest”, and “Slimy Gut Land” - one of those is made up and I’ll let you decide which. You’ll solve puzzles, you’ll fight, you’ll jump, and - in the most misguided development decision I’ve seen in a while - you’ll swim. Let me get this out of the way: Doom Eternal does not need swimming sections. They are easily the low point of the entire game. They’re mercifully short and sparingly used, but swimming is clunky and annoying. There’s also points where you have to swim inside radiation where you can only survive for about ten seconds while wearing a rad suit. It’s not rad at all. It’s a word that rhymes with rad (it’s bad, to be clear). I also want to put the new tentacle enemies that pop out of holes in the ground on blast - they aren’t challenging, they’re just irritating. The platforming doesn’t get quite as much in the way as I feared, though there’s a fair bit of it. It helps to break up the action, but sometimes the richness of the environments makes it difficult to gauge where you’re meant to jump to, and the ability to double dash in the air means you often judge distances through trial and error. You don’t die when you fall, thank Satan, but there are some platforming sections towards the end of the game that might test your patience. It all goes a bit “it’s-a me, Doomio”. Other than that, I ran into a few minor bugs, like in one arena where the enemies would infinitely spawn until I reloaded a checkpoint (and this wasn’t because of a Buff Totem, which is a new addition that spawns enemies until destroyed, or an Archvile, which is functionally the same). I also got stuck inside some geometry once, and the final boss got locked into an animation so I couldn’t finish him off without reloading. That’s all I had over my 15 hours of playtime, however - Doom Eternal is buttery smooth, slick, and polished for the most part. Even loading screens are nippy. When you’re right in the thick of it, zipping around like a toddler after a pack of Smarties, efficiently and methodically laying waste to the hordes of hell at 900 gibs per minute, this is the strongest Doom has ever been. It’s the combat of Doom 2016 expanded in clever ways, built upon in layers, like the skin and muscles of a demon that you remove in chunks with each trigger pull. Playing it is like catharsis, a virtual wall punch for the modern age. Version tested: PS4 Pro - a review copy was provided by Bethesda.

Michael Leri 
Following up smashing success hasn’t been Doom’s strong suit. Doom 3, the long silence that followed, and the ill-fated Doom 4 are striking examples of the series being damned by its own past achievements. But the Doom Slayer kills damned things for a living and eviscerated that slump with the spectacular 2016 reboot; a surprising accomplishment that puts DOOM ETERNAL in the same hellish hot seat that has doomed others before it. Although instead of burning to ash in that hot seat, Eternal rips and tears it wide open, resulting in a more varied and streamlined version of the one the best first-person shooters ever created.Doom (2016) was such a landmark shooter for many reasons but mostly because of its gameplay. Adapting the 1993 mindset of the debut, the reboot was remarkably fast and pushed you to use your trigger finger and brain to kill and refill your dwindling resources as quickly as possible. The breakneck pacing (buoyed by the high and stable frame rate) meant that every fight had an improvisational feel to it since you weren’t afforded the time to sit back and strategize; your approach had to be decided as you were mere inches from the nearest horned hellspawn. It was like jazz, but with slightly more murder.Despite the Doom Slayer’s penchant for dismemberment, Eternal has left that beating heart of the franchise intact. Chaining shotgun blasts and guided rocket barrages while ensuring to frequently Glory Kill and rev the chainsaw to refill your resources is still the rush it was back in 2016. No other game has even come close to matching the near-perfect nexus of speed and strategy that this formula naturally has and, given the dearth of meaningful competition, is still an utter blast to perform every time.But without expanding upon that, Doom Eternal would be a poor sequel and instead of merely using a bigger scale as a cheap marketing bullet point, the game uses its newfound additions to improve almost everything. While the returning array of armaments has seen some worthy changes, the most substantial new inclusions are the Flame Belch, ice grenade, and Blood Punch. The Flame Belch mini-flamethrower is useful for burning armor out of foes. The ice grenade allows for better crowd control or combo potential. And the Blood Punch, once charged, turns your melee into a shockwave that is handy for instantly slaughtering groups of fodder and staggering bigger demons.ALSO: Doom Eternal and Animal Crossing fans share the strangest friendship on the internetDoom’s chess-like combat encounters are exponentially better when there are more pieces at play, especially when those pieces have distinct gameplay benefits. Choosing when to use what ability is just another quick decision you have to make that yields even more depth as you have to constantly remember what you have loaded and what’s on cooldown in the heat of the moment. The weapons also play a big role in this as the array of primary and secondary fires are more toys that feed both the bloodthirsty and analytical sides of your brain.Eternal intelligently forces you to use every part of your loadout, too, as none of your many tools has much ammo. Ostensibly, by slightly starving you of resources, you’re required to constantly hunt for what you need and switch up your playstyle in the process. It’s an ingenious way for the mechanics push the player to play the game at its best: laying waste to every demon while also not wasting any part of its arsenal.Doom (2016) only wasted one part of its arsenal: the crouch button. Id has replaced it with a dash that, when combined with the new monkey bars and the grappling hook on the Super Shotgun, make the already mobile Doom Slayer considerably more mobile. Cranking up the speed to 12 is more thrilling and demonstrates how Doom is better the faster it is played. While just an illusion founded upon Eternal’s higher speed, it almost makes the 2016 reboot seem slow. Almost.All of these mobility and weapon upgrades are also evenly spread over the game’s runtime. Carefully doling out these new toys repeatedly gives you something else to master and once you’ve grasped one ability or weapon, another is dropped in your lap or hidden behind a secret cracked wall. Masterful pacing ensures that you start as a badass and only get continually more badass until the final encounter, which is an engaging approach more games ought to steal.The enemies and level design put the Doom Slayer’s enhanced armory to the test and bring out its best parts. Eternal has a much larger array of demons and every one has a certain style and level of danger. Prioritizing threats and what instrument fits the job is Doom at its very core and having a bigger pool to pull from allows for an endless supply of fresh encounters.It never comes close to exhausting all of the possible permutations, something the remixed Master Levels (more of which are coming soon) effortlessly showcase. Eternal’s constantly growing lineup of monsters allows for some devilishly devious combinations, but that’s one of the game’s most outstanding assets. Through its various weapons, upgrades, abilities, and enemies, the game is designed in a way to never stagnate as there is always some way to rearrange its multitude of variables and create an original encounter.Environments contribute to this ever-cycling sense of originality and are the unspoken hero in and outside of combat. Stages have more intricate geography with interesting setups outside of the combat arenas. Climbable walls and the aerial dash make platforming more involving and are simple yet effective ways to break up each demonic skirmish. Nothing can top the shooting — and the other parts don’t try to — but it cleverly uses the mobility that’s integral to the shooting to make the other parts of the game even better.But it also looks different as Eternal shifts Doom away from the franchise’s safe places — Hell and Mars — and goes in some bold new directions. Mars and Hell are only sparingly done, but each have better, more involved vistas than any other entry in the series. It even goes outside of the normal red and orange hues, relying on bright purples, yellows, and greens that look like if Hell  vomited on an open cadaver after downing six bags of Skittles. The Cronenbergian, fleshy Hell and Earth fusions are still the haunting highlights, even if a small handful of the normal buildings within them are drab by comparison. While not bland or attratively grotesque, the other angelic and icy environments are striking in other ways and illustrate how solid art direction can successfully guide a game out of its comfort zone.Doom Eternal, through its hardcore art design and kinetic combat loop, is extremely metal and its soundtrack is the aural linchpin that ties it all together. Ambient tunes bubble with intensity, filling in the quieter respites, but then explode as Satan’s forces materialize and is the audio adrenaline that perfectly pairs with the onscreen carnage. Few games have such an intimate connection to their music, which stands incredibly well by itself, but is infinitely better in the game; a feat few titles in the medium can claim.Given all the banging metal and big fuckin’ guns, Doom Eternal sounds like it would have the narrative depth of the first five minutes of a porno. Instead, it tells an unobtrusive tale that doesn’t impede the gameplay and rewards those who pay attention. Scenes are brief and effective at conveying the necessary information while also pointing more lore-hungry players to the optional codex.Be it the journal, the cutscenes, or both, the game efficiently expresses the unexpectedly poignant themes of its plot along with the backstory of its world and protagonist. While other aspects like the soundtrack, weapons, and Easter eggs pay homage to past entries, its narrative might hold the most respect for its history without going overboard. It may lack a bit of the charming nonchalance of the reboot, but it’s still an effective example of economical, restrained action game storytelling.Doom Eternal has a lot in common with Doom 2. Both could never dream of matching the surprise or legacy of their immediate predecessor, but they each confidently expand on the historic foundations those games set. Using fast-paced first-person shooting as the framework, each sequel has wildly improved level design, a wider selection of demons to massacre, and a larger arsenal that come together to refine its core identity in the smartest, most respectful ways possible. However, Eternal is more ambitious than its 1994 counterpart, pushing even further and creating one of the best first-person shooters ever made in the process. The Doom Slayer has faced many nightmarish opponents and toppled them all, yet his greatest victory might be slaying the impossibly high expectations set by his genre-defining precursors.We’ve now gotten to extensively play Battlemode and while it doesn’t change the score, here are our thoughts.While Doom Eternal’s campaign is an experience that can stand on its own, it doesn’t have to. Battlemode, instead of a functional but dry assortment of deathmatch modes, pits two player-controlled demons against one juiced up Slayer. It isn’t just a throwaway mode like the reboot either, as it meaningfully adds to the game despite its occasional hiccups.Like Modern Warfare’s Gun Fight, it’s a more intimate affair that automatically dials up the action because there are fewer people to absorb the pressure. And given that it directly borrows so many of the mechanics from the campaign, it’s already filled with an excess of adrenaline. Playing as the Slayer is empowering because you can do almost everything an endgame Slayer can with most of the same upgrades, weapons, and abilities. Nothing gets lost in translation — a huge positive for a game with such strong solo mechanics — and using those single-players against real people is exhilarating.The demons are essentially all new but they’re still a blast to control. Each hellspawn has its own style (that you can master in the effective tutorials) and using those unique powers in cooperation with your demonic partner to squeeze the Slayer strikes a different type of rhythm that is similarly as engaging. Demons can summon other A.I. demons, too, as well as create healing bubbles or hazardous zones, depending on what of the two variants you pick. Each of the three people also get to pick an upgrade after each match, further introducing more strategic options.It’s simple yet still has plenty of depth, given all the possible ways to use your tools. Thanks to id’s work on the core mechanics, the micro gameplay loops are sound so it doesn’t need to lean heavily on upgrades or an array of loadouts. It just uses them to augment some of the best first-person shooting out there.Unlock systems can also help enhance any online game, but there aren’t many of them here, at least natively. A sizable portion of the cosmetics are exclusive to different editions, the Slayers Club, pre-ordering, timed events, playing the other Doom games, or some other weird extracurricular marketing campaign. While it’s fantastic that both halves of the game use the same skins and challenges, this leaves little in the actual game for regular people to unlock and thus a shorter metagame. The sheer unique concept of the mode carries it quite far — not every game needs Call of Duty levels of experience bars and unlockables — but a few more cosmetics to chase in the actual game would have been ideal.Its abbreviated metagame hook isn’t as much of a problem when compared to its bugs. The game will sometimes automatically empty all of your gadgets, blare the sound effects, not give you experience until well after a match, fail to put on the skin you chose, or lag without warning. Nothing damns Battlemode to the fiery underworld and many of these sound like something a patch or two could fix, but they stick out when the campaign is as sharp as they come. Still, both modes together make for one hell of a rewarding package that pay homage to the past while aggressively pushing into new territory.GameRevolution reviewed Doom Eternal on the PS4 with a copy provided by the publisher.10Michael Leri is ComingSoon's Senior Gaming Editor.

DOOM Eternal,Chris Carter,Destructoid,https://www.destructoid.com/review-doom-eternal-583021.phtml,"darkBack in 2016, Bethesda was following a policy that limited early review access to its games.Doom fell under said policy, which led to concerns regarding its quality, and whispers that Bethesda wasn’t confident in it. It only took five minutes of playing it, tops, for people to realize that wasn’t true, and that Doom categorically ruled.Bethesda didn’t make the same mistake with Doom Eternal.Doom Eternal (PC, PS4 [reviewed on a PS4 Pro], Stadia, Switch, Xbox One)Developer: id SoftwarePublisher: Bethesda SoftworksRelease: March 20, 2020 / Switch (TBA)MSRP: $59.99I don’t necessarily need a story in a Doom game, but Eternal‘s got one.The approach is a bit different and wholly old-school: less “uncovering a mystery” and more “rip and tear,” with the hellish motif front and center as Earth has already been subjugated by demons. There’s plenty of lore to read and some cutscenes available if you want them, but Eternal is very much content keeping action at the forefront. The gist is that you need to hunt down priests that have besieged Earth to save it, and hunt you will.Eternal‘s best beats involve the enhanced focus on the hero, the “Doom Slayer,” as well as the Slayer mythos as a whole and what makes him tick. His characterization of a badass that gets things done without being a stone-cold killer of men rules, as he never skirts the line of unlikability and radiates personality even if most of his dialogue consists of grunts. Beyond a very abrupt ending, the reductive narrative serves Eternal well.Gameplay is also equally urgent. One of my favorite things about the new Doom reincarnation (Eternal included) is how id Software once again nails the sense of speed. You get a double-jump immediately, you get double-dashing soon after, and it gets better from there. Eternal brings back the idea of wielding a (limited-use) chainsaw to recover ammo and ripping apart weakened enemies with “glory kills” for health, but adds in two other wrinkles: the “Flame [Thrower] Belch,” which burns enemies in exchange for armor shards, and a super punch of sorts that refreshes after glory kills.This leads to a rapid-pace self-sustaining economy of power-ups, where you periodically chainsaw, burn, or glory kill to keep your run going. If you saw, torch, and rip apart things correctly, you’ll always have a stream of health, armor, and ammo respectively without having to rely on pickups. It sounds confusing but it’s more natural and intense in practice, especially when you’re juggling a room full of varied enemies on a tougher difficulty setting. It’s still so refreshing to not have to manually reload.Those enemies, mind, also have more of a strategic overarching design. They have more pronounced weakpoints that encourage you to surgically take out enemies in specific ways, like shooting the tail off of a Spiderdemon to thwart its long-range capabilities, or throwing a grenade into a Cacodemon’s mouth to instantly trigger a glory kill prompt. It feels really gamey at first, but once you’re overwhelmed in a giant arena full of varied foes, trying to figure out the best way to approach each and every fight, it feels more justified. The only hiccup is when you annoyingly have to hunt down that one last demon until a critical path door opens.During my tests, performance was great on a PS4 Pro, consistently rolling along at 60FPS, with 10-second-or-less load times. I encountered a few moments of stuttering during cutscenes (but rarely during gameplay), and one stuck checkpoint that I needed to reload to trigger. That’s it. Everything is communicated on the HUD and accessibility options are available, including HUD alterations, even on consoles. When you add in more customization for the Slayer (like out-there rune passive abilities, returning weapon mods, and stat-increasing level-ups), it gets even more engaging.Once again maps feel acutely designed to provide a great deal of exploration while remaining pointed. Environments have a looser aesthetic, ripped free of the shackles of the mostly Mars/Hellscape motifs of Doom 2016: we’re galaxy-hopping now. Individual maps beg to be explored with the “fast travel” mechanic (which sounds stupid in a Doom game at first) that lets players jump to different points of a map right before its finale. In other words, it’s a way to grab stuff you missed before you leave and have to restart the entire level over.Despite the hardcore-looking veneer, things are loosened up a bit in general. You can swap difficulty settings at any time without penalty (with the exception of the permadeath settings, which are essentially different modes). Cheat codes are also available and do not disable progression. The game gets weird with select moments where you possess a drone of a demon and wreak havoc, and the campaign is still mission-based, as it traditionally has been since the start. A Fortress of Doom hub (which I call the “Doom Room”) allows for a bit of respite and a way to store your collectibles between missions, like a fun interactive “next mission” menu. It’s kind of like Mortal Kombat‘s Krypt but without the microtransaction baggage. You can of course go back into any completed mission for a 100% clear, and periodic “Master Levels” are available, which are remixed, tougher stages that give hardcore players a reason to run through them a third time. For disclosure, we did not have access to the multiplayer-centric “Battlemode” for this review outside of the brief tutorials, and as such it covers the single-player campaign.Doom Eternal keeps the strong foundation built back in 2016 intact, while adding some of its own panache in the process. I think we can officially declare that the last iteration wasn’t just a lone fluke, and that Doom is back in the shooter spotlight where it belongs.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher, covering the single-player portion of the game.]GreatImpressive efforts with a few noticeable problems holding them back. Won't astound everyone, but is worth your time and cash.

DOOM Eternal,Josh Hawkins,Shacknews,https://www.shacknews.com/article/116944/doom-eternal-review-one-hell-of-a-party,"New to Shacknews? Signup for a Free AccountAlready have an account? Login NowDoom Eternal ups the ante from Doom 2016 by adding platforming, new mechanics, and new gadgets. But is this sequel a worthy successor to the throne? Our review.Doom Eternal is by far one of the most anticipated games of the year. Following id Software’s huge success with Doom 2016, many old and new fans alike are looking forward to diving into the Doom Slayer’s next chapter. There’s a lot to digest with the latest entry in the series – from new mechanics and weapons to the return of some iconic demon classes – and Doom Eternal is one hell of a good time.Editors note: This review only covers the singleplayer campaign. We'll have an official piece on the Battlemode multiplayer soon.Doom Eternal wastes no time thrusting players back into the action. The world is on fire – quite literally – and demons are piling in from Hell. The earth’s population is falling drastically and it’s clear that there is only one man who can stop it all from happening. Enter the Doom Slayer with a flourish of the series’ iconic heavy metal music. There’s no extended build-up here. No slow-motion entry point like we had in Doom 2016. Gone are the days of the pistol; Long live the Combat Shotgun.This is one of the first big changes players will recognize between Doom 2016 and Doom Eternal. The infinite ammo pistol, which could come in handy during those dry spells when ammo was a bit tough to find, is gone. The Combat Shotgun is your basic weapon this time around, and you’ll find yourself coming back to it again and again throughout your playthrough.Other weapons unlock at standard progression points, with the Assault Rifle, Plasma Rifle, and even the BFG-9000 joining your arsenal as you make your way through the campaign. As always, you’ll find yourself equipped with more than enough to take down the demons in your way. Unlike previous Doom games, which allowed you to pick and choose your weapons a bit more, ammo does get a bit scarce at times in Doom Eternal, forcing you to move through your weapon wheel in ways you might not have before. Enemies now feature defined weakspots, which when utilized can completely turn the tide of battle in your favor.As someone who enjoys using the Combat Shotgun, and the explosive rounds that come with it, I often found myself having to move through the other weapons that I had available to me, as ammo can get pretty tough to find during intense fights. Still, the new platforming abilities, and the new dash mechanic made for a nice change of pace, giving you new avenues to get away from danger quickly if you found yourself struggling to stay alive.As far as FPS games go, Doom has one of the richest histories, with over 25 years across the series. Despite the success of Doom 2016, id Software needed to follow it up with something even bigger. To do this, new mechanics and even new enemies were added to the lineup to help freshen things up and throw some wrenches into the well-oiled cogs that made Doom 2016’s gameplay feel so good.The game still feels great with the new mechanics. Platforming works out well for the most part and adds some nice touches to combat – allowing you to swoop away using well-placed bars around the various combat arenas. These new mechanics also open up new areas of exploration, allowing you to move up and through levels much more efficiently. Unfortunately, Doom Eternal falls into the very pitfalls that most linear shooters do, where players are forced to learn to play the game the way that the developers intended.This isn’t a game that allows you to pick and choose where you want to go or how you want to approach situations. You are a murdering machine, armed to the teeth with weaponry, and you’re going to have to make use of it if you want to stay alive.Platforming isn’t the only new device you have at your disposal, though. The Meat Hook – which is attached to the Super Shotty – allows you to grapple onto enemies, pulling you directly to them. This is handy during some fights, however I found it pretty useless the majority of the playthrough, as I was much more efficient at disposing demon hordes while moving around constantly. Of course, players more well-versed in the dance of Doom might find more use out of it in their own playthroughs.The Flame Belch also adds a nice dynamic, allowing you to light enemies on fire as you battle around them. This creates little chunks of armor that fall off of them, allowing you to add some additional defense to your dance of death. I will admit that I wasn’t very good about making the most of this new device, but it did come in handy during tough fights with lots of enemies.Doom Eternal does a really good job of building off of the god-like view that has come to surround the Doom Slayer throughout the series. In fact, as you explore the world, you’ll find various audio logs and broadcasts that seem to correlate with this thought – that the Doom Slayer is some holy avenger sent to protect humanity. It’s a novel idea that works well, and as you dive deeper into the narrative that id Software has woven here, it all really comes together.I won’t spoil the exact nature of the narrative, as it’s something best experienced by Doom fans, but I was happy with the way that id Software brought everything between Doom Eternal and Doom 2016 together into a cohesive story. If you enjoyed digging deeper into the story behind the violence in the reboot of the series, then you’ll probably really enjoy the narrative direction that Eternal has taken.What makes Doom so special for me, is the game’s ability to just make you feel like an absolute badass. While other games have tried to capture that same feeling, none have ever done it as well as id Software has with Doom. Unfortunately, there are a couple of points in Doom Eternal where this feeling is ripped from you. In fact, one of the later boss fights of the game takes away that feeling entirely, as you’re left to scrounge around the map for ammo drops, all while dealing with enemies that take multiple shots to kill. It’s a huge takeaway from the mainstay of the series, and it made the entire fight feel like a chore instead of a challenge.Aside from that particular boss fight, though, the game does a very good job of making you feel like a force to be reckoned with. It’s a feeling that still feels great despite the 4 years that have passed since Doom 2016 revived the series.It’s very clear playing through Doom Eternal that the developers have designed it to be replayed again and again. While the normal battle encounters won’t change, the way that the levels are designed opens up a load of exploration once you’ve become more accustomed to the different mechanics.Slayer Gates and other secrets are littered throughout the world. These secrets include everything from Extra Lives to Cheat Codes that can be activated in Mission Select. There’s also the new Fast Travel function, which unlocks at the end of a level, allowing you to teleport back to key areas of the level to explore more. This all helps to encourage exploration and replaying of levels. If you were a fan of 2016's classic Doom levels, then you'll be disappointed to learn that I didn't come across any during my time with the game. They might be out there somewhere, but at the time of this writing I haven't come across any. All around, though, the exploration options in Doom Eternal are much greater than in 2016, with much larger levels and areas just waiting to be found.Furthermore, the game has taken a heavy approach to challenges. Not only will you find the level-wide challenges for weapon points, but you’ll also find weekly challenges that all count towards an overall season experience level. It's unclear how the developers plan to extend the content beyond this first season, but it does at least leave a road for Doom Eternal to grow much larger after release. The game also features a slew of skins that you can unlock to change how the Doom Slayer looks in the singleplayer and multiplayer modes, so if you're someone who enjoys loads of visual variation, you'll find plenty on tap in Doom Eternal.While Doom Eternal does a good job of building off of 2016’s success, the game isn’t without its missteps. The lack of any form of deathmatch feels weird – especially when you consider the part that the Doom series played in the birth of the game mode. The lack of any form of Battlemode access during the review process is also somewhat troubling, but we’ll have more on that particular mode after it becomes available at the game’s launch.As a whole, Doom Eternal is a solid game, and a great sequel. Unfortunately, it never goes beyond the scope that Doom 2016 set. While there are new mechanics and weapons, it just doesn’t offer that same sense of freshness that the reboot did. Platforming – while a strong addition to many parts of the game’s exploration – often feels heavy handed and forced. Some encounters require you to time dashes and jumps together.Sure, I appreciated the puzzle-like nature of some of these instances, but others left me slowly losing armor or health as I plummeted to my death because it wasn’t very clear which direction the developers wanted me to go. I often found myself wondering ‘can I make that jump?’ only to discover that I couldn’t because it wasn’t how I was intended to proceed.It’s very clear from playing through the entirety of the campaign that id Software has designed every encounter with a “right way” to play it, and going outside of the lines that have been drawn will cost you – whether it costs you a death, or just some health and armor, is all dependent on how quickly you learn to pull your crayon back inside the lines where it belongs.This review is based upon a PC review copy of Doom Eternal provided by the publisher.

					Josh Hawkins posted a new article, Doom Eternal review: One hell of a party 
					Great review, Josh. Glad you enjoyed the game!				
					THREE MORE DAYS UGGGH				
					Nice! 				
					[deleted]				
					I lol'd.				
					[deleted]				
					Yessir.				
					[deleted]				
					Definitely.				
					Yes. And it's worse than every other game we gave a 9, apparently. :)				
					Great review! I can't wait to play!!!				
					Not sure its my type of Doom. 				
					[deleted]				
					Not a fan of  ""going only where the developers want to go"" exploration route that many reviewers are commenting on. Doom to me has multiple paths and its up to you how you get to point a to point b.				
					How can a game built on keys to access parts of the map and backtracking be considered multiple paths?				
					I don't know, I'm going on what reviewers are saying compared to Doom 2016.				
					You said doom to you is about multiple paths, which makes no sense if you have ever played any of the doom games. 				
					Maybe he got his copy of Doom mixxed up with his copy of World of Warcraft.				
					Yeah even if you compare Far Cry to Doom3 one was extremely linear and one was the more open world game.  Never really considered Doom to be about freedom of choice on objectives.				
					Classic Doom (and 2016) had a critical path through the level. Get red key, open red door, get blue key, open blue door, exit. It also had copious optional content that was not on the critical path. D2M1 had a chainsaw, a rocket launcher, a shotgun, a pile of health globes, some armor and 2 combat encounters that were only available if you went off the critical path, and that map was TINY. So I guess it's not about having multiple paths, but about having the option to explore off the critical path that people are worried about. For what it's worth, the 2 reviews I read or watched mentioned that exploring for secrets is still in the game, and that doesn't sound remarkably different from what we had in previous Doom games.				
					Thats what I what. Its not like the typical call of duty experience.				
					Can I get a what what				
					This one is the same according to the lgr review 				
					So my issue was that the game is very much built around the overall flow that the developers have set out for it. Yes there aren't multipaths in the usual sense of it, but that wasn't what I was referring to. Doom is and always should be a linear experience. It just fits. My problem was that the developers have created this flow for combat and if you don't follow it, you're penalized. I felt that Doom 2016 allowed me to experiment more, where as Eternal was very much ""this is how you kill this. Do it this way or you'll run into issues"". Does that make more sense?				
					It does in that Hugo has stated it killed him when people weren’t playing Doom right, like you said, and then would complain that they only needed the shotgun to beat the game.  From what I gathered, your complaint is exactly what they were aiming for, they WANT you to play the game the way they designed it, not cheat it (essentially).   				
					Anyway, I haven’t played the game yet, you have.  I have no leg to stand on but am just going by what I heard from Hugo and what I understood of it.  				
					Oh yeah, for sure. It's what they wanted, and that's fine. I just preferred being able to play the way I wanted a bit more. The game is still great, just wasn't what I wanted from the experience. Might be exactly what others out there want (aside from the devs) and that's great. This is just one opinion out of many.				
					Right on 👍 I totally respect that.				
					If you like Doom and don't mind having to follow the flow a bit more than usual, then it's still a great game, and a great Doom game. But, if like me, you prefer being able to play 99% of the game using your favorite weapon, then you'll probably run into some issues.				
					The platforming stuff makes me question whether I should get it. I hate platforming. 				
					Wish they'd release it early. I bet they could.				
					The problem with day/date digital/physical releases is that the digital release isn't allowed to go out until street date per the contracts with physical retailers.  Not all retailers receive it early and have it stocked.  Some don't get it until the day before due to shipping and logistics issues.				
					Are there any physical retailers still open to sell it?				
					Hey!  You're that guy that does that daily pandemic map thing!  Cool!				
					Also, given the lock in at ho e for the next bit this will be one of the few times I pick up a new release game.  I usually wait for a deep discount awhile later.

While there are new mechanics and weapons, it just doesn’t offer that same sense of freshness that the reboot did. Platforming – while a strong addition to many parts of the game’s exploration – often feels heavy handed and forced. Some encounters require you to time dashes and jumps together.OH MY GOD! Some encounters require timing and skill!?  FuuuuuuuuuuuuAlso the review isn’t even complete as they didn’t get a chance to try out the new Battlemode or whatever its called and then complained there’s no deathmatch.  				
					[deleted]				
					When I think of Borderlands 3, I think of freshness!				
					Damn.  Reminds me of the time Jeff Gerstmann reviewed Half Life 2 and gave it an 8 point something and Halo 2 got a nine point something and people were losing their minds; “HALO 2 is better than HL2!?  Fuck you Jeff!“  				
					[deleted]				
					This one better allow quick saves or people are going to rage out.				
					Well it’s not their fault, Battlemode isn’t live until next week. DOOM 2016 didn’t even get pre-release reviews. Like the reviewers got the game same time as everyone else. Usually this is a warning sign that the game is awful but not this time. I think they seriously weren’t done with it and in this day/age of online patching they can just work up until the wire. And I’m ok with that if DOOM 2016 is the result. 				
					Yeah, I mentioned that we haven't touched Battlemode and would follow up with a piece on that once we can. That's a completely different piece of the puzzle. This review is based on the singleplayer. The lack of deathmatch is small, sure, and it isn't something I took off an entire point for. It was a small con that many of us on staff felt was worth mentioning. Encounters require timing. Right? how dare I be upset a game requires skill to be good at. I'm not.  I'm upset that the developers got heavy handed with the platforming because ""it's a new mechanic and its cool make them use it"". That's how it felt to me.  Did it still work out? Sure. But sometimes the jumps they wanted you to make required a wonky amount of timing to pull off, and sometimes jumps you thought you could make, couldn't be made at all. These are issues that all platforming games run into, and something worth calling attention to since the game focuses so heavily on the new feature.  
					There absolutely is no and will be no deathmatch. We already confirmed this fully. It's not even a point.				
https://www.shacknews.com/article/116948/bethesdas-pete-hines-defends-not-including-deathmatch-in-doom-eternal 
					Exactly.  So why complain about it?  				
					Because it is an id software game. They invented the mode.				
					And when is the last time a Doom game had good DM?  1996?  				
					Doesn't mean we can't want it. It's not like we took off an entire point for. It's still a valid complaint.				
					I suppose... It’s just something we weren’t expecting and if it were in there it would have been an amazing  surprise for sure.				
					Sure. This was just more of a passing ""it sucks it isn't there"". Not a ""this game sucks butts because no deathmatch"". It's fine without it, just would have been cool to have it.				
					It's okay. At least we have Quake Champions when we want to play deathma-- Oh.				
					OOOOOOOF. Too soon, David. Far too soon.				
					[deleted]				
					I mean Battlemode legit looks fun to me. It's not Deathmatch, but I'm kinda okay with that - I can get that already. I do want to give it a real shot. They're clearly aiming for making it a real competitive thing.				
					Sonic & Mario at the Olympics got a 9... Doom only an 8? Its the end of days! 				
					It’s almost like different people reviewed the games.				
					I know I was just joking. Didn’t mean to offend :( 				
					I CAN'T FUCKING WAIT.				
					Hate to be that guy but the video quality is bad although i have set it to the 1080p, also 30fps for a Doom game. Last but not least, playing Doom with a controller for a community that is PC centric				
					i found a different video with the first 10 minutes of the game, in 4khttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ6BnaE0Inc and its looking really good				
					Good review.  Seems like it’s safe to preorder.				
					Didn't Shacknews stop assigning scores to their reviews for a while? Does it turn out scores drive page views or something?				
					Metacritic drives traffic. Metacritic only accepts scored reviews.				
					Honestly, I see that in this game. In Call of Duty MW 2019 I pinged it for the same thing. The second you wander off a predetermined path you instant die.

For the most part, it succeeds. Doom Eternal returns us to the familiar feel of its run-and-gun predecessor, with just enough variety to keep the new game from feeling like a mere expansion pack. But a few changes throw off the game's flow so badly that they threaten to derail the whole experience.The story specifics in Doom Eternal are as wonderfully ignorable as they were in the previous game. Instead of fighting in Hell or on Mars, this time you take the fight directly to the demon-infested Earth, tearing through countless grunts to get to three demonic priests. You have to go through a series of plot points on the way to confronting each priest, but each one may as well read “[Insert mystical hell-demon gibberish].”We haven't been able to test console or Stadia versions of the game as of press time.Some short cut scenes try to build out your character's history and motivation a bit, complete with a lot of hard-to-follow proper names for demons and settings that will have no resonance for most players. You can pore through pages and pages of hidden lore if you want to get a better grip on all this, but I found it easier to just tune out. I was much more intrigued by the holographic displays and the loudspeaker voice-overs sprinkled through random hallways, all hinting at a vast propaganda regime trying to integrate human society with the demonic interlopers seeking to harvest their souls.Doom Eternal ever so slightly expands on the limited settings of its predecessor; our hero travels through ornate ancient castles, high-tech space stations, and ruined urban settings this time around. For the most part, though, the fiery reds and muddy browns that characterized the last Doom are present here, along with an overload of generic death-metal imagery that would put a 12-year-old goth’s sketchbook to shame.The basic gameplay loop hasn’t changed much in the last four years. That means fighting through massive rooms filled with all manner of demons, most of which will be familiar even if you haven't played Doom since the '90s. The weapons are largely familiar, too, right down to the unlockable customizations in “secondary fire” mode that let you transform weapon functions to your tastes. (I won’t spoil the reveal of one major new weapon late in the game, but I will say that it is ammo-limited, extremely overpowered, and nearly as satisfying as unleashing a BFG blast on an entire room of enemies.)Standing still for even a second amid the demonic onslaught means losing a significant chunk of your health and armor, so you're forced into near-constant motion as you use dashes, ledge climbs, and jump pads to dodge incoming fire and close-range attacks from the ground and above. Efficiently dealing with a single room's particular demon assortment is akin to a real-time resource management puzzle game. Each enemy type has its own particular vulnerabilities—which the game explains to you rather bluntly on your first encounter—so you have to switch weapons constantly to conserve limited ammo.This flying demon needs a grenade in the mouth to instantly explode. That one needs you to charge a powerful Blood Punch to remove its armor. Another has an energy shield that only a plasma rifle can penetrate. If you were hoping to pick a single favorite weapon and just spam it through the game, you’re out of luck.Meanwhile, you have to be aware of when your flamethrower is fully charged so that you can burn nearby enemies and make them drop some useful armor pickups. (Don’t ask me how this is supposed to make sense, even in the Doom universe.) And don't forget to tear up a few staggering, near-dead demons with a gory Glory Kill to get the crucial health pickups that you’ll definitely need to survive. Be ready to throw a quick grenade blast that will freeze a large group of demons and buy you some crucial breathing space. And keep your chainsaw handy to instantly turn one of the room’s more minor threats into a quick ammo restock.Still with me?Keeping all this straight in your head as you constantly bob and weave away from threats on all sides can feel a bit overwhelming, even for veterans of the last Doom. Stick with it, though, and things will eventually click. You will become a finely tuned stimulus-and-response machine, flowing through challenges that would have felt completely impossible just a few gameplay hours before. The action is balanced on the edge of going completely off the rails, with just enough health refills and areas of relative calm for a careful player to get their bearings before the next onslaught.(Doom Eternal also includes quite a few hidden one-up items that give you a single chance to continue a fight after a lethal mistake. Unfortunately, you don't get a choice when you use those one-ups, meaning you'll probably end up wasting at least a few on relatively easy battles with random grunts, rather than saving them for the crushing onslaughts you know are coming.)At times, Doom Eternal feels less like a first-person shooter and more like a modified version of a bullet-hell shoot-em-up, where you’re just looking for that small open space amid an ocean of threats. It’s a design that makes Doom Eternal’s firefights much more than mindless shooting galleries, and it keeps everything quite a bit more engaging than the usual pop-and-fire cover-based shooter.Between firefights, things get eerily calm as you work your way through Doom Eternal’s labyrinthine maps, which are sometimes too confusing for their own good. Even with the aid of a detailed in-game map, I wasted minutes at a time just trying to figure out how to get to the next glowing checkpoint. But this confusion is also put to good use, with dozens of hidden power-ups and collectibles in each level, some of which require real ingenuity to reach.There’s also a somewhat off-putting focus on first-person platforming challenges between the fights. At its best, there’s a bit of satisfaction to be found timing out the perfect combination of double-jumps, air dashes, and acrobatic swings off exposed bars in order to bridge a wide chasm and barely grasp an out-of-the-way climbable wall. At its worst, the game might inexplicably miss a double-jump input or fail to have you grab a ledge that was well within reach. The penalty for these failures is just a small loss of health and a bit of wasted time, but the system is just finicky enough to make the whole thing more frustrating than fascinating.The frenetic flow of most Doom Eternal fights is so tuned to perfection that it’s incredibly disappointing a bit more than halfway through the game when you run into a single enemy that threatens to completely break that careful balance: the Marauder.Unlike every other normal enemy in the game, the Marauder has a magical energy shield that instantly and completely blocks any attack you throw at it, including those thrown by the most powerful weapons in the game. The only window when the Marauder becomes vulnerable opens during a brief moment in a single attack cycle, when his eyes flash green and he lunges at you with a huge axe. Those moments—which require split-second reaction times and pinpoint aiming accuracy to take advantage of—only come if you maintain a perfect middle-distance range away from the Marauder. If you’re slightly too close or too far, he just pummels you with powerful attacks while you wait for an opening that doesn’t come.The catch in this case is that the game includes a built-in dynamic resolution scaler, designed to reduce pixel density on the fly to maintain a 60fps lock. But this is a barely noticeable issue. During particularly strenuous battle moments, an on-screen indicator estimated the total resolution dipping by 20 to 25 percent, usually for less than half a second. Otherwise, the resolution and frame rate remained pretty stable while pushing this game beyond its recommended settings level, and that bodes well for a variety of CPU and GPU combos in the wild.With every other enemy in Doom Eternal, the best defense is a good offense; if you get too carelessly aggressive, they’ll get aggressive right back and kill you before you can kill them. The Marauder, instead, hunkers down behind his perfect defensive barrier 95 percent of the time, all while threatening you with his own aggressive positioning and powerful attacks. More than being difficult, this feels downright unfair given the non-stop dodge-and-shoot patterns the game establishes before the Marauder’s appearance.It’s already annoying enough when the Marauder shows up as a lonely boss in a mostly empty room. As a one-off timing and positioning challenge, he might not be too bad. But then Marauders start to appear as ""just another enemy"" in a room full of pressing threats. Waiting for the rare openings where you can even get through a Marauder’s shields requires so much attention that it short-circuits the knife-edge, run-and-gun balance of the rest of the encounter. The only realistic option is to evade the Marauder completely while you kill everything else in the room, then face him one on one—by far the most frustrating part of any encounter.It feels a bit petty to focus on one annoying enemy. But when that one enemy is responsible for a good 80 percent of the frustrating moments I had in an otherwise well-tuned and fast-paced shooter, the situation is hard to ignore. (At least half of the remaining frustration goes to a single boss fight that features a similar hide-behind-a-shield turtling mechanic.) More than just a difficult speed bump, the Marauder is a challenge that feels antithetical to everything that makes the new Doom games what they are.Fortunately, Marauder fights remain rare enough that they can't spoil the wider Doom Eternal experience; they are more like an occasional sour note in an otherwise engrossing symphony. Even after 20 hours or so spent ripping and tearing through demon hordes, I’m still eager to go back and try some of the late-game master-level challenges and to search the maps for a few more hidden trinkets, which should keep me busy for a good while longer.After a long break, the new Doom formula still hasn’t worn out its welcome in Doom Eternal. Hopefully, we don’t have to wait four more years to get another helping.Editor’s Note: Bethesda was unable to make multiplayer servers available for testing as of press time. We will share impressions of these after launch.Verdict: Doom Eternal is a thrilling return to form and a high-water mark for fast-paced twitch shooting.

DOOM Eternal,Kirk McKeand,VG247,https://www.vg247.com/2020/03/17/doom-eternal-review/,"
I just leaped at a pole, swung, span 180 degrees and fired a sticky grenade into a cacodemon’s mouth before hitting the floor. When it exploded I dashed forward, jumped, swung again, and stabbed that fucker in its bulging eyeball. All of this happened fluidly, in one smooth motion, in the space of a few seconds. So why, oh why, do I keep accidentally punching every computer terminal, door, and switch I see? In most games, interact being on the same button as something else would be a complete no-no. Remember jumping whenever you tried to open a chest in Dragon Age: Inquisition? Bad. No. Stop that immediately, developers. Stop it now. In Doom, it’s good actually. Hear me out... Interact is on the same button as punch in Doom Eternal, just as it was in Doom 2016, and it means you’re constantly smacking things by accident. I love it. It’s completely in character for Doom Slayer to punch inanimate objects like an angsty teen. In fact, at one point, the game gave me an achievement for punching a gate. That’s because id Software, for the most part, understands what gives Doom its own identity in a world filled with samey first-person shooters. Doom Eternal is self-aware - angry with a cheeky wink. Combat is about pushing forward instead of holding back, running at the thing that’s killing you and using it as a resource, taking what you need from its bloodied corpse... if those chunks of meat can be called a corpse. It’s about meticulously designed arenas that you can navigate backwards at breakneck pace, always shooting. Doom Slayer is rage personified - a mute Kratos, an agent of blind vengeance who doesn’t listen to anyone. He can punch a gate if he wants to. The game welcomes it. Hell, so does the gate. It’s an honour. This sequel is about delivering more of that stuff you loved, faster than before. You don’t even start with a pistol this time - there isn’t one. It starts with a short cutscene and you’re straight into Hell on Earth with a shotgun loaded and ready to go. Within the first hour, your shotgun has a detachable grenade launcher and a rapid fire mod, and you can freely switch between the two with a button tap. You also have an assault rifle, which itself has a scope and rocket silo you can swap out mid-battle. Then there’s your shoulder-mounted grenade launcher. The dial starts at 9 and turns up to 999, I need a doctor. Most of the weapons you find are floating pickups that you run over, automatically pick up, admire, then unload on a demon within seconds. It drip feeds new enemies, new tools, and new tactics constantly. Everything is faster than before.As well as your arsenal, there are a variety of runes you can equip to tweak your gameplay style, and you can have three active at a time. My preference is one that speeds Doom Slayer up after executing a Glory Kill - those gory finishers you can trigger after sufficiently damaging an enemy - another that allows me to snap to Glory Kill target from further away, and one more that slows down time if I hold alt fire in mid-air. These three runes let me dictate the flow. 

If I’m under assault, I can zoom-snap to a damaged target to take advantage of the invincibility frames of a Glory Kill more easily - as ever, these kills provide you with health that spills from your enemy’s mutilated body. Once I’ve done that, my movement speed doubles for a few seconds, allowing me to create some distance - fair warning, this game is fast anyway and this makes it feel like you’re controlling a Bugatti. When the speed throws off my aim, I can run into a bounce pad, fly into the air, hold alt fire, and rain down a missile barrage in bullet-time. The ability to control the pace adds a lot, giving you the space to put on the brakes and assess the situation on the fly: which demons to prioritise, where to aim, what weapon to use, and where to head to keep yourself out of the firing line without getting boxed in. It’s astounding how many different enemies there are, and how various combinations of enemy types change the feel of each encounter. Whenever you see a cacodemon flying nearby, your first instinct is to deal with it quickly. If they get close, they can corner you and tear at you with vicious bites. A single grenade in the mouth - either from your shotgun alt fire or your shoulder-mounted launcher - will prep them for a Glory Kill, but you might forget the other demons all around you as you adjust your aim to the skies. Fortunately, the new tool attached to the super shotgun, the meat hook, lets you take the aerial advantage yourself by grappling and pulling yourself towards an enemy. You can combine that with the aforementioned rune to slow time to a crawl, creating heroic moments where you take to the skies, time slows, you land a meaty headshot, and things instantly go back to seat-of-your pants mayhem as you land. The core gunplay of Doom has never felt as good as this. The new demon degradation system adds heft to each shot, with every bullet searing the flesh from your foes. Now we’re ripping and tearing, and not just when we’re splitting a demon in half with our hands. I also can not understate how satisfying the new sound effect is for exploding heads, like a kid popping their cheek with their finger. Pop! The sound design marries the gunfeel to extraordinary effect here, and this is backed by Mick Gordon’s ear-pounding soundtrack, now with added heavy metal choir. It all combines to put you in the zone, an all-encompassing experience that’s best enjoyed with headphones. Like those cacodemon gobs, each enemy has a weak point and you can reduce their effectiveness by taking advantage of these achilles tendons. Hop over a charging pinky, spin around and shoot its tail. Blast the guns straight off a cyber mancubus, or wade in with a Blood Punch, smack one, and strip its armour in one move. Snipe the turret from an arachnotron. Fire the plasma rifle to explode energy shields, damaging any dumb demon stood nearby. There’s a tool and tactic for each enemy type, as there was in Doom 2016, but now there’s more nuance to it - you have to switch your brain so you’re calculating kills like a murderous supercomputer. Even other new tweaks like the flame belch - a short burst of fire from a shoulder-mounted weapon - adds a layer to encounters. Set a group of enemies aflame and every bit of damage you do will make them bleed armour shards, topping you up. Glory Kills for health, flame belch for armour, and your chainsaw is right there to cut demons open for ammo. A new melee weapon called the Crucible Blade unlocks later on, giving you the chance to insta-kill most enemies, though it has limited uses and needs constantly topping up. The BFG also makes a return, though it’s now on the radial weapon menu rather than being this devastating smart bomb with its own dedicated panic button. This works fine for the most part, though the fact you auto switch to your last used weapon when you run out of ammo does occasionally lead to you accidentally firing it and wasting this rare resource. As well as expanding your arsenal, id Software has opened up the levels in Doom Eternal. Doom 2016 was criticised at launch for its predictable structure, where players moved from corridor to arena, corridor to arena. Here the arenas feel more organic, like part of an environment. They’re more open, more layered, and there are more routes through them and more environmental hazards to take into account. They are large enough and with enough routes through to feel boundless, yet still flowing. These spaces have edges, of course, but they fit into the environment in more natural ways. Portals, swing bars, and bounce pads make for interesting routes through them. And sometimes the game offsets those large arenas by spawning in a demon in close quarters, forcing you to adapt and think fast before the situation gets away from you. There’s much more visual variety here as well. You’ll walk across the weapons of long-dead titans, and into the chest cavity of a murdered giant. You’ll traverse lakes of molten lava, ascend to the heavens, look out into space, and see Hell on Earth both from ruined cities and the Arctic - literally Hell frozen over. Interiors are extravagant and interconnected, packed with fine details: statues with gold inlays, reflective materials shimmering in the light, elaborate door mechanisms, and mechanical contraptions snapping and whirring into place. It’s a visual step up, a Doom with a view. The story that plays out across this journey is also stronger. It lays it on thick with optional lore, there are many more cutscenes, and it gets across more of Doom Slayer’s character, tying modern Doom to its past and creating an expanded Doomiverse. You’ll travel to places with names like “Terrordome”, “Super Gore Nest”, and “Slimy Gut Land” - one of those is made up and I’ll let you decide which. You’ll solve puzzles, you’ll fight, you’ll jump, and - in the most misguided development decision I’ve seen in a while - you’ll swim. Let me get this out of the way: Doom Eternal does not need swimming sections. They are easily the low point of the entire game. They’re mercifully short and sparingly used, but swimming is clunky and annoying. There’s also points where you have to swim inside radiation where you can only survive for about ten seconds while wearing a rad suit. It’s not rad at all. It’s a word that rhymes with rad (it’s bad, to be clear). I also want to put the new tentacle enemies that pop out of holes in the ground on blast - they aren’t challenging, they’re just irritating. The platforming doesn’t get quite as much in the way as I feared, though there’s a fair bit of it. It helps to break up the action, but sometimes the richness of the environments makes it difficult to gauge where you’re meant to jump to, and the ability to double dash in the air means you often judge distances through trial and error. You don’t die when you fall, thank Satan, but there are some platforming sections towards the end of the game that might test your patience. It all goes a bit “it’s-a me, Doomio”. Other than that, I ran into a few minor bugs, like in one arena where the enemies would infinitely spawn until I reloaded a checkpoint (and this wasn’t because of a Buff Totem, which is a new addition that spawns enemies until destroyed, or an Archvile, which is functionally the same). I also got stuck inside some geometry once, and the final boss got locked into an animation so I couldn’t finish him off without reloading. That’s all I had over my 15 hours of playtime, however - Doom Eternal is buttery smooth, slick, and polished for the most part. Even loading screens are nippy. When you’re right in the thick of it, zipping around like a toddler after a pack of Smarties, efficiently and methodically laying waste to the hordes of hell at 900 gibs per minute, this is the strongest Doom has ever been. It’s the combat of Doom 2016 expanded in clever ways, built upon in layers, like the skin and muscles of a demon that you remove in chunks with each trigger pull. Playing it is like catharsis, a virtual wall punch for the modern age. Version tested: PS4 Pro - a review copy was provided by Bethesda.

DOOM Eternal,Diego Perez,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/doom-eternal-review/,"Doom Eternal is the world’s goriest game of chess. On the surface, the game’s over the top carnage might seem like mindless ripping and tearing, but at the core of every battle in Doom Eternal is a series of split-second decisions that mean the difference between life and death. There’s a very strict set of rules that the game forces you to abide by. It knows exactly what it is and wears the violence as a badge of honor. Doom Eternal wastes absolutely no time getting to the point, and so neither will I. Doom Eternal is one of the best first-person shooters of the generation.The thing that’s most immediately apparent when starting Doom Eternal is the game’s unbridled confidence. Just about every aspect of the series has been turned up to 11. After a slick intro cinematic, you’re immediately thrust into a room with demons to slay. Unlike Doom 2016, you don’t start with a measly pistol. You start with not only the shotgun, but also the chainsaw, and that alone should be enough to demonstrate that Doom Eternal doesn’t waste any time getting things started. From the second you’re given a gun to the moment the credits roll, Doom Eternal is a nonstop thrill ride that will beat you down and force you to use every tool at your disposal to survive.That’s the primary difference between Doom Eternal and its predecessor, too. In Doom 2016, you could get away with using whichever weapons you liked. Doom Eternal enforces a much stricter ruleset, though, dramatically lowering base ammo counts and making certain weapons better suited to tackling certain demon types. The demonic hordes of Hell have grown significantly in number as well, and the game pits you against groups of enemies way larger than anything in Doom 2016. Demons are also much more aggressive and can take you down in a few hits, especially on higher difficulties. As a result of these changes, Doom Eternal feels like a strategy game masquerading as a shooter, forcing you to constantly think on your feet and blend together glory kills, chainsaw kills, and several different weapon types in the most efficient manner possible. Failing to utilize all of the tools at your disposal will quickly lead to your demise, and this will no doubt turn off a lot of players that are just looking for an extension of Doom 2016. Those that stick with Doom Eternal’s strict ruleset, however, will be greatly rewarded with some of the most brilliantly design combat encounters in recent memory.The demons in Doom Eternal can be viewed as deadly resource caches as much as enemies. Because you’ll constantly need to refill your health, armor, and ammo pools, you’ll not only be dodging the attacks of powerful foes, but also prioritizing weaker enemies and marking certain targets to glory kill or chainsaw. In Doom 2016, glory kills were pretty much the only thing you’d be doing in combat other than shooting. Sure, the chainsaw was available, but it was used sparingly thanks to the much higher ammo count of all the weapons. In Doom Eternal, the chainsaw is a necessity rather than an option, and you’ll be thankful for how quickly it regenerates fuel once you realize how often you’ll need to use it. A new shoulder-mounted flamethrower called the flame belch also adds another layer of complexity onto the combat loop, allowing you to set groups of demons aflame and cause them to drop armor as a result. Every fight in Doom Eternal is a game of resource management, and you’ll find yourself barely scraping by at times while the relentless hordes of demons slowly whittle down your health, armor, and ammo. The power fantasy of Doom Eternal comes primarily from mastering its multi-layered mechanics rather than outright brutalizing everything in your path.Speed has always been a key element of the Doom franchise, but Doom Eternal incorporates mobility and platforming into the core gameplay loop to an extent never before seen in the series. In typical Doom fashion, if you stop moving, you’re dead, but Eternal’s environments are built with movement and verticality in mind, to the point where some arenas can start to feel like playgrounds with monkey bars and swingsets dotted around. Jump pads will send you flying into the air, and you can swing using yellow bars to reach new heights. The Doomslayer is also equipped with a double jump from the get-go, as well as a new horizontal dash ability that is obtained very early in the game. These movement options are just as crucial to your survival, if not more, than your comically large arsenal of weapons, and they open up several new avenues for experimentation. The Doomslayer has always been an incredibly mobile character, but Doom Eternal sees the Slayer more acrobatic than ever before.Doom Eternal also features quite a few dedicated platforming sections in between combat encounters, incorporating the aforementioned jump pads, monkey bars, and movement abilities into jumping puzzles to get to the next fight. Certain walls are now climbable as well, providing safe spots to reset your dash cooldown or simply to plan your next move. While many of these platforming segments are over before you know it, some of them hide some of the game’s many secrets and collectibles, making them worthy of exploration. Still, they never overstay their welcome and the secrets don’t require too much digging to uncover, so it’s hard to resist going out of your way to try and find weapon upgrades or hidden toys when the opportunity presents itself. They also help to break up the would-be monotony of endless combat encounters, doing wonders for Doom Eternal’s pacing, something Doom 2016 needed a little extra work on.Collectibles themselves have also been dramatically improved in Doom Eternal. The toys from Doom 2016 thankfully make a return, as do the other standard things like Runes and weapon mods, but Eternal has seen an injection of new hidden content that will attract even those who aren’t typically secret hunters. Music tracks from the original Doom games, as well as other id Software series like Quake, appear in the form of collectible vinyl records that can be played in the new Fortress of Doom hub area. Sentinel Batteries unlock new things in the Fortress of Doom, providing everything from upgrades to new skins for the Doomslayer. The real standout secrets in Doom Eternal, though, are the secret encounters and Slayer Gates. Secret encounters are exactly what they sound like, hidden optional combat encounters that must be found before they can be attempted. Slayer Gates, on the other hand, provide the most challenging fights in all of Doom Eternal, and you’ll have to use absolutely every trick in the book to come out alive. These secrets are great because they provide the best reward Doom Eternal can possibly offer: more Doom Eternal. Toy figures and music tracks are a fun novelty, but nothing encourages exploration like the promise of more expertly designed combat encounters.Story has never been the focus of Doom, and Eternal’s story is nothing to write home about. The pacing has been dramatically improved, though, and the level variety issue that Doom 2016 was criticized for has thankfully been addressed in the sequel. Each location is just as exciting as the last, and the frequent changes of scenery prevent levels from blending together. After trudging through Doom 2016’s environments that were all some variation of Mars or Hell, it’s refreshing to be sent somewhere new every hour or two. There’s a lot to see in Doom Eternal, from cities ravaged by the demonic invasion to ancient Sentinel ruins, and each environment does a lot to keep things feeling fresh throughout the roughly 15-hour campaign. Of course, the excellent music helps too. Mick Gordon returns as the composer of Doom Eternal’s soundtrack, and the pulse-pounding heavy metal tracks are even better than the fantastic work featured in Doom 2016.Doom Eternal is also infinitely more replayable than its predecessor, as higher difficulties offer more of a challenge than ever before and the total amount of collectibles is through the roof. Then, there’s the addition of master levels, which are remixed versions of locales from the main campaign featuring different demon types, enemy placements, and combat encounters. At launch, there are only two master levels available (one of which is locked as a pre-order bonus), but more are planned to be released in the coming months. The currently available master levels definitely live up to their name, though, throwing so many different things at you that you might as well be playing an entirely new mission. The two master levels in the game right now are from the earlier portions of Doom Eternal’s campaign, so simply adding in demons from later in the game like the Marauder is enough to spice things up at the moment. How id Software chooses to remix levels from later in the campaign remains to be seen, but given the challenge and complexity of what’s already available, they likely won’t hold anything back.Once you wrap up Doom Eternal’s single-player offerings, it’s time to jump into Battlemode, the game’s new multiplayer mode. Doom 2016’s deathmatch multiplayer has been removed entirely, replaced by an asymmetrical mode that pits two player-controlled demons against a fully-equipped Slayer. Playing as the Slayer feels exactly like it does in the single-player component of the game, while the different playable demons provide new skillsets to master. Because the Slayer is so ridiculously powerful, the two demon players have to synergize with one another and use their abilities in tandem to pin the Slayer in an unfortunate position in order to finish him off. Battlemode is a novel concept, but it’s definitely the weakest part of the package. It serves as a fun distraction for a few hours, but the mode sorely lacks any sort of longevity. After an evening of playtime, you’ve likely seen everything Doom Eternal’s multiplayer mode has to offer.All in all, Doom Eternal is one of the most confident games I’ve ever played. It knows exactly what it is and exactly the type of experience it sets out to provide, and attempting to come at it in any other way simply will not work. It knows how over the top it is and it revels in its ridiculousness. Enemies explode in a rainbow of ammo pickups after you chainsaw them in half. There are floating 1-up pickups all over. The secrets are marked with giant question marks. Headshots and weak point shots play an immensely satisfying audio cue when you land them. Doom Eternal is not afraid to be itself, and that’s an impressive feat in a world of watered-down AAA games. Doom Eternal doesn’t care what type of game you want to play. It’s in charge from the beginning, never relinquishing its grip until the credits roll. It’s incredibly demanding, laser-focused, and unapologetically brutal, and it’s all the better for it.
Attack of the Fanboy / GAME REVIEWS / Doom Eternal Review"
DOOM Eternal,Mick Fraser,God is a Geek,https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/doom-eternal-review/,"March 20, 2020.There were occasional moments while playing Doom Eternal when, upon staggering messily to the end of a particularly gruelling encounter like the last man standing on an epic pub crawl through an active warzone, I had to put down the controller, rub my eyes, walk away from the screen and place my face into the cold, tight corner of the room and have a “moment”.As a standalone experience, Doom Eternal is roughly equivalent to having your brain removed and replaced with a jukebox that plays nothing but Disturbed, and a view like a butcher’s window; as an evolution of the franchise first brought to life by id Software way back in 1993, it’s almost perfect. Like the orca whale, the Golden Eagle, or the African lion, Doom has, over the decades, evolved to be the apex predator in its territory.At this point, id Software has such a confident and competent team at work on this franchise that the game fairly struts, a steel-feathered peacock with guns and gore and explosions where the pretty green patterns should be. From the moment you step into the romping, stomping boots of the Slayer, your senses are assaulted with noise and violence, and if you’re not playing this in a dark room with headphones strapped around your feeble mortal ears you’re doing it wrong.See, nothing about Doom Eternal has a soft edge. Early on you’ll liberate an orbital fortress from the forces of Hell that affords a breathtaking vista of an invaded Earth, her once green and verdant face scarred by burning pentagrams thousands of miles across. And from this fortress you’ll launch a one-man offensive on anything with horns, scales, or massive canons surgically attached to its forearms. It’s a sanctuary, as if you need one, and offers a perspective of the Slayer that you won’t get anywhere else, by way of his collection of figurines, magazines, metal as hell guitars, and guns. If he has a sentimental side at all it’s for the trophies he hoards in what passes for his living quarters.The Fortress of Doom itself acts as a hub, where you’ll return between your uber-violent excursions, and acts as a treasure trove of alternate skins, upgrades module and Easter eggs that you can explore at your leisure. Or if you get bored not ripping the bottom jaw off of something every three and a half seconds you can head down to the “Ripatorium” and go ham on conjured fiends in what amounts to a practice room. And, honestly, a practice room isn’t a bad idea in Doom Eternal.Systems sprout from systems like hydra heads in the opening hours as you’re introduced to all the different collectibles you’ll need to find in order to upgrade each weapon, upgrade the upgrades for each weapon, improve your Praetor combat suit, boost your Slayer’s attributes, and add permanent buffs to your performance. Initially it’s a lot to take in, but give it a little while and it begins to make more and more sense on a scale roughly parallel to how desensitised you’re slowly becoming to picking tiny chunks of demon out of your armour joints.Every tiny incremental upgrade is essential, though, as Doom Eternal is nothing if not Hardcore AF, and it will remind you of that fact at every opportunity. Even played on the default Hurt Me Plenty setting (referred to in other, lesser games as “Normal”), there were times when I just wanted to sit alone and cry for a while before carrying on. Whatever horror aspirations this franchise may have had at one time or another (Doom 3, in particular, I’m looking at you) are long-since drowned in their own blood and tossed on the fires of raging fury.You know how most games start you off with a pistol, then maybe a submachine gun, and save the shotgun until a bit later when you’re ready to take the stabilisers off your murder-bike? Well Doom Eternal, in time-honoured fashion, starts you off with a shotgun that doubles as a grenade launcher and then just continues to hand you bigger and messier guns as time goes on. Want some low-level enemies to smash through until you get your bearings? Here’s two zombies and– ah, bollocks, throw in the spider-demons. What are we on? Level 1? Prologue done? Wheel out the Mancubus, well Mancubi, I suppose because you’ll rarely have just one of anything to contend with. Doom Eternal’s combat is a satisfying, frustrating, but above all thrilling dance of risk and reward. There’s no cover mechanic, no ADS and no reload button – you simply burn through ammo until you’re dry then swap to the next gun on the wheel without so much as a cigarette in-between, and aside scattered pick-ups that diminish as the difficulty rises, the only way to get ammo from your enemies is to chainsaw them in half. While canisters of fuel lie here and there to make life that little bit easier for the discerning demon-slayer, the best way to refuel your chainsaw is to mush faces. A shoulder-mounted flamethrower will ignite demons and force them to shed armour pick-ups, while if you’re after a boost to your flagging health, the returning Glory Kill is your go-to-guy. Hitting R3 when a demon is staggered will perform a gratuitous finishing move that rains health among the brains and eyeballs. Perform one on a Cacodemon and tell me the wet pop as you rip out its eye isn’t the most satisfying noise you’ve heard in a game for years.With these systems in place the combat loop in Doom Eternal becomes like crimson crack, and it’s only when you realise that in order to survive an encounter you must always be killing that the nuances of the combat become visible through the curtain of red mist. Whereas in Doom 2016 you could arguably get through the entire game with the shotgun, in Eternal you must constantly switch between death-dealers to maximise their effectiveness. Shielded enemies, for example, are only weak to the plasma cannon, while the energy shield upgrade on the Chaingun can be a life-saver in a clutch. Each encounter is treated as a standalone instance, which rewards you with a weapon point to improve the mods on your guns with things like reduced cooldowns or a greater blast radius, and hidden time trials and Slayer rooms afford even more goodies if you can stomach the challenge.Each mission is crammed with hidden pathways and collectibles, from cheat codes that make return runs of finished missions that much easier, to figurines, skins, and power-orbs that grant super speed, double defence or infinite Glory Kills for a set time limit. With the new wall-climb ability and a double-jump, double-boost chain, getting around the environment and navigating the many platforming puzzles is as satisfying as the combat. That said, there are moments when the platforming can frustrate. The way forward is rarely brightly signposted, and leaping before you look can lead to repeated failure. During heated moments, this can become almost maddening. One particular section I faced had enemies buffed by a totem that doubled their speed, defence and damage, while respawing them on an endless cycle. Trying to deal with that while also trying to identify how to reach the ledge I needed to reach had me close to rage-quitting.You’ll notice I’ve not mentioned the story yet, but that’s because in every way it feels secondary, and that’s not always a good thing. Without spoiling too much, it doesn’t even properly continue from 2016’s Doom but deliberately skips a chunk of the narrative to be filled in later, and once again your entire motivation is “kill everything and then blow up something big”. There are more cutscenes in Eternal, though, and a handful of returning characters or familiar names dropped into conversation, but on the whole the story is more like rickety scaffolding holding up the altar of bloodshed than a coherent narrative.It looks bloody brilliant, though. You wouldn’t necessarily expect to see a lot of beauty in a Doom game and, to be honest, a great deal of what you see is things that used to be beautiful only now they’re on fire and covered in viscera, but there a few sky-boxes that will take your breath away, and the detail in environments is impressively attentive. Some areas and textures may be re-used, but the blooms of blood and fountains of brightly-coloured loot never get old, and the animations of the Glory Kills are far more varied than in Doom 2016. The trade-off is an occasional glitch here and there, and I noticed a stutter during some of the more frantic encounters – but this performs unbelivably well for the speed and ferocity of the gameplay.A battle pass system is in place that allows you to earn Event points as you play to unlock cosmetics mostly for use in multiplayer. ID cards, icons, outfits and emotes, etc, give you something to work towards and, as of writing, there’s no online store to buy boosters, though there may be one at launch. The multiplayer itself is kind of just okay, and escapes heavy scrutiny right now because a) it’s difficult to get a game pre-release, and b) it’s churlish to complain about having the option to play multiplayer even if you probably won’t use it. There are people who’ll get invested, I’m sure, but for me it feels a little superfluous to requirements.It’s called Battlemode and features a 2-v-1 set up where a single player takes the role of Slayer while the other two select demons to run around as, including the Mancubus and Hellknight. The demon players can spawn minions in the form of imps and possessed marines, and can remove pick-ups from the world. However, they can’t remove pick-ups that have fallen from the slain player-controlled demons. In order to win, the Slayer must kill both player demons within 20 seconds of each other. I played a few rounds and found it to be fun enough, but it feels like something that exists secondary to an incredibly competent and complete single player campaign.Doom Eternal genuinely doesn’t give much of a crap what you think of it. It doesn’t care if you’re hardcore or not because it knows full that if you’re not, then it’s not for you. It’s loud and brash and hellishly violent, but above all it’s 100% video game. It’s not trying to be an interactive movie, political commentary or thinly-veiled ad campaign; it’s a game about killing demons as quickly, as messily, and as efficiently as possible. It wants you blast your way through every one of its gargantuan levels (and believe me, some of these levels really are huge) with a stupid grin that only leaves your face when you’re scowling with rage at a sudden and deliberate spike of difficulty. Doom Eternal might not be the perfect video game, but it absolutely is the perfect Doom game.Best-in-class combat loop

DOOM Eternal,Dean Takahashi,GamesBeat,https://venturebeat.com/2020/03/17/doom-eternal-impressions-one-of-the-best-shooters-eva/,"Connect with top gaming leaders in Los Angeles at GamesBeat Summit 2023 this May 22-23.

The demons have invaded Earth, killing millions and overrunning 60% of the planet by the time you get there. You can stop the invasion by locating the hell priests and bringing them down.GamesBeat Summit 2023Join the GamesBeat community in Los Angeles this May 22-23. You’ll hear from the brightest minds within the gaming industry to share their updates on the latest developments.I can confidently say that it is one of the finest first-person shooters that I have ever played. And for those of us who need a distraction from our own apocalyptic reality, I am so glad that I can spend many more escapist hours fighting bosses and demons in Doom Eternal — all to the sound of heavy metal and gunfire.It’s a bit ironic that this bloody game about shooting and bludgeoning everything in sight may very well help us all keep our sanity.Here’s our other coverage of Doom Eternal: A lucky shot, my favorite firefight, a double boss fight, a video about the beginning of the game, and puzzle-solving.Above: So many guns.Speed and powerId Software’s previous game, Doom 2016, set the tone for this game. It is all about fighting increasingly powerful and numerous demons. As the Doom Slayer, you are Earth’s only hope at pushing back the horde. You fight alone, but you have speed and power, with an ability to rip apart demons with your bear hands. And you get more and more weapons along the way that can do satisfying harm to the demonic horde.Forced movementDoom Eternal is like a forced march, or maybe a marathon where all you do is sprint. You have to keep moving to stay alive. If you camp in a corner or try stealth, the demons will spawn on you and kill you. To motivate you to move, the designers have devilishly put very little resources on the ground for you to pick up. Rather, it is by moving and killing that you can collect what you need.If you do a Glory Kill (melee) attack on a stunned demon, you kill the demon and get health. If you use your flame belch, the enemies you burn will drop armor plates. If you do two Glory Kills, you can fire a massive Blood Punch to take out multiple enemies. And if you find cans of fuel on the ground, you can quickly refill your chainsaw, which otherwise gradually refills itself over time. And if you use the chainsaw, you can get ammo. The trick is to remember all of this in real time.It’s not just a horde you’re fightingIt may seem like a horde, but I counted more than 25 different types of demon minions and bosses that you have to fight. And none of them are the same. You have to change weapons on your weapon wheel (I played with a game controller on the PS4), and you have to remember a lot of different ways to fight. It’s hard to remember to use your ice bomb or flame belch, but you won’t be victorious without these weapons.The plasma gun works against enemies carrying shields or the Carcass Demon, who can deploy a shield to protect other demons. The heavy cannon has a Precision Bolt mod that lets you pull up a sniper scope and knock the turret off the top of an Arachnotron, a spider-like enemy that can deal massive damage from both far away and up close. The Pinky demon is like a rhino, but it’s vulnerable from behind.The Hell Knight, remembered by its exposed skull, forces you to run faster because it is so fast. You have to use the Dash button a lot to escape. Once he catches you and corners you, you’re dead. So you have to run away from him and fire at the same time. It takes a few big hits with a rocket or sticky bomb to bring him down. If you have a bunch of enemies including the Hell Knight, you have to deal with the Hell Knight first.One of the earlier bosses, the Doom Hunter, requires two different types of weapons. It is a hybrid, part creature and part machine. You take out the creature’s shields with a plasma rifle, and you can disable the mechanical part with rockets or the precision bolt mode of your heavy cannon (which is like sniper rifle).Most of the enemies you see in beginning are familiar, as the inspiration for the monsters came from the rich history of Doom itself. But later on, you’ll see new characters. These enemies include Imps, Zombies, Cacodemons, Demons, Prowlers, Whiplashes, and Revenants. The new ones are the Doom Hunter, Marauder, and the Gladiator.A delicious array of weaponsAbove: That’s a lot of stuff to shoot.When you finally locate that BFG, that’s the moment in every Doom game when you feel like you’ve arrived. But the weapons and their modes and attachments really save the day. Without the shotgun and its add-on sticky bomb, I would not have survive the hordes charging at me. I could use the sticky bomb to do damage at range, and I used the shotgun or its even more powerful Super Shotgun to fight up close.The Super Shotgun has a meat hook attachment, which shoots at an enemy and brings them to you, so you can fire the Super Shotgun and turn them into little pieces.Bosses that fill you with a sense of panicThere are many difficult bosses in Doom Eternal. I know. I lack credibility here, and I think everything is hard. But I’m telling you. It ain’t easy.Just when you think you’ve finished a gargantuan firefight, you have another level to clear and another boss to fight. Each one seems tougher than the last, and the combat is seriously stressful. This will cause you angst, panic, frustration, anger, sadness, and a fine sense of fatalism. And that’s all good in a video game. Don’t play it if you don’t want to feel like throwing your gaming machine out a window.The game also has Slayer Gates. If you find a Slayer key, you can use it to unlock an optional arena. If you are leveled up enough, you can survive it after what feels like an eternity of battle as wave after wave of demons attacks you.Great graphicsWhile I played it on the PS4, I’ve seen how the game looks on a PC. And it’s quite spectacular. While it’s not as crazy as the colors of Rage, the orange of Hell spawns and the green of radioactivity and the cacaphony of colors in explosions makes it a joy to play. It’s like watching a fireworks show while you’re playing a video game. Id Tech 7 is the game engine, and it can create some amazing imagery that seems to go by at 200 miles per hour. I was pleasantly surprised that the graphics didn’t make me seasick.Heavy metal soundtrackDoom Eternal would be Doom Mortal if it didn’t have a pulse-pounding soundtrack. Composed by Mick Gordon, Doom Eternal’s music puts you in the mood to fight. Rip and tear and listen.Fine-grained difficulty controlsIf you find that you can’t beat a level on Hurt Me Plenty or Nightmare, you can reset the difficulty level so that you can beat it. And you can raise it again later on. These difficulty controls are really necessary in a game that can throw so many challenges at you.Very few bugsDuring many hours of gameplay, the game quit on me only once. Once in while, it slowed down when there were insane amounts of things happening on the screen at once. But overall, it is a very well-built game.Boss battles with lots of badass demonsThe ending is long and drawn out. And, as is fitting, you have to deal with very difficult bosses. Each one is hard. The Gladiator is an arena fighter that has one vulnerability, and you have to strike at the right time to beat it. The Khan Makr is protected by Makr drones, which you have to take out by sniping their heads. They drop on a lot of ammo and health, which keeps you alive in that boss fight, but it is very distracting. When you are sniping the drones, you obviously aren’t watching the deadly Khan Makr, which rains down area effect flames on you.Then you go through an enormous number of enemies, battling to the top of a building, so you can finally take on the last enemy, the Icon of Sin. That is a huge monster, and it can spawn a bunch of demons that will keep you busy. You have to take out its armor first and then take it down. Fortunately, you have a lot of Crucible (one-shot kill swords) that respawn, as well as BFG ammo that respawns.Meanwhile, the Marauder appears at the end of multiple levels, and it is extremely hard to take out. The Marauder is a fast demon that is good at both short-range melee attacks and long-range ax throws. Your only chance is at medium range. And you can’t fire anything else at it, as it will dodge the slower weapons. It will also shield itself against most attacks.Your only hope is during a well-timed moment. When the Marauder’s eyes glow green, it’s about to strike. That is your chance to fire the Super Shotgun at it. If you hit it once, you can fire again and hit it twice. After that, it will move around you and you have to be prepared to run. I had a hellish time trying to run away from the Marauder during one battle. I kept running and waiting for minions to spawn so I could get back armor and health. I finally got enough shots in on the Marauder to stagger it and take it down. But it was grueling. It’s best to take out all the minions and other demons around it so you can give the Marauder your full attention. Eventually, I got better at the Super Shotgun timing, but Marauders were always the toughest enemies.Above: Chopping another demon.RepetitionI know I said there are a lot of variety to the demons. But you mow down so many of them that you get to feel like you’ve seen all of this combination of characters before and know just the thing that will take care of them.Toward the end in particular, the game throws relatively few new things at you. It makes up for that with volume. That is, it throws tons of enemies at you at the same time. Toward the ending, there were 10 Cacodemons on the screen, and a bunch of Pinky demons as well, all hunting me down while I was supposed to be taking out the Icon of Sin. This makes the game difficult, even on the easy setting, but it’s almost as if they ran out of other things, like new demons, to throw at you.It could use more new characters and storyWhile the demons are familiar, they don’t have personalities the way that the Orcs did in the Shadow of Mordor series. You got to know those Orcs and their personalities by fighting them over and over. But the boss demons feel like they’ve all got the same basic evil going on. I wish there were someone like Darth Vader or a sniveling coward, much like there are so many different weapons.But I realize that this game is not about characters and story. John Carmack once famously said that stories in video games are a lot like porn films. You don’t need them. Of course, he was wrong. But it feels like this game swings back on that heritage a little too much. Doom 2016 conveyed more story in its holographic scenes, but you don’t have that in the same holographic images in this game. Rather, you have to read about the lore in the Codex as you collect missing pages of a book. But it’s a bit boring to get your story from reading in a video game. I’d rather see a lot more of that conveyed in cinematics or some other fashion.More hints for the puzzles?I put a question mark after this one because I was highly frustrated when I had to work on puzzles over and over again, either the kind that were just mentally hard to figure out (like one scaling a skyscraper) and the movement puzzles that required a lot of magical controller skill to execute. If there were a way to get a hint about where to go next (the map has this, but it’s not always obvious) or what to do, that would ease a lot of my near heart-attack level of rants and curses. But when I solved the puzzles, I felt like a genius. And then I would notice there was a bright green light showing me what I was supposed to notice the first time around.But one of the things that the puzzles do is slow down what is otherwise a lightning-fast game. That’s the part which I find hard to swallow, as getting frustrated and unable to move forward is counter to the core philosophy of the game of keeping the player moving. It certainly stretches out the length and the “enjoyment,” but it really adds to the challenge.Marty Stratton, head of the id Software studio, has said he believes Doom Eternal is the best game id Software has ever made since the first Wolfenstein and Doom games in the 1990s. Call me a mouthpiece, but he’s right. It’s certainly the best Doom ever, and I can say that even though I thoroughly enjoyed the agonizing journey to the finish with Doom 2016.Just when you thought power fantasies couldn’t get any better, Doom Eternal comes along with its universe of blood and gore to put you in a state of flow. I have had so much fun, like getting a lucky shot at a Cacodemon. I’m going to enjoy finishing this one and finding the ultimate gun, the BFG.I enjoyed the ending, but it was so long. I had to wipe the sweat off my forehead. But it felt so good to be done.[Updated: 5:47 p.m. 3/21/20 with post-game thoughts and final score]Score: 90/100Disclosure: Bethesda Softworks gave me a copy of the game on the PS4.GamesBeat's creed when covering the game industry is ""where passion meets business.""

To hear my father tell it, he didn’t even want this obviously violent game in his home with three young kids, but we saw it on display in a store, and begged for it incessantly.These days, thanks to uniformly enforced ESRB ratings and the internet, no one would dare mistake Doom Eternal ($60; PC, PS4, Xbox One, Stadia) for a kid-appropriate game. Doom Eternal, the long-awaited follow-up to Doom (2016), is definitely violent. You’ll tear all manner of creatures limb from limb, ripping out eyeballs and punching in faces as easily as you breathe. Still, despite all the blood and guts, there’s a wholesomeness to Doom Eternal that not many other shooters can claim. After all, the things you’re killing are demons, and your mission is to save Earth.It just so happens that the work feels so good.Editor's note: Multiplayer servers were not live before launch, so this review covers the single-player campaign only.Doom Eternal picks up where Doom (2016) left off. If you’re not sure where the previous game left off, that’s fine. All you need to know is that demons from the Hell dimension have invaded Earth, leading to mass casualties and generally unfavorable conditions. Everything’s on fire — literally — and only the fabled Doom Slayer can stop the demons' progression before Earth is lost forever.There’s a wholesomeness to Doom Eternal that not many other shooters can claim.Even though Eternal largely adheres to series canon, it’s also a great jumping-on point for players who are new to the series. It doesn’t take long to figure out the Doom Slayer’s purpose: send those pesky demons back from whence they came, using a variety of increasingly powerful weapons. Classics like the super shotgun and chainsaw are still around, as well as some new tools, like the supercharged melee Blood Punch, and an ice bomb that nicely complements the frag grenade. There are also a few blasts from the Doom Slayer’s past, which I won’t spoil here. The weapons get doled out at regular intervals throughout the game, which helps propel ol’ Doomguy forward with impeccable pacing. An upgrade system lets players customize gear to their hearts' content, and use weapons in ways that best suit their play styles.Environmentally, Doom Eternal builds on its predecessor in a big way. One of the biggest complaints about Doom was that its repetitive, enclosed corridors and arenas all started to feel the same after a dozen hours or so. Doom Eternal hasn’t completely lost the hellish aesthetic, of course, but the game also takes you to unexpected new places. In them, you might find yourself checking out the beautiful scenery, or gazing out at the stars while you contemplate the vastness of space. I should also mention that Doom Eternal looks gorgeous running on the Xbox One X, with only a handful of minor technical hiccups marring an otherwise smooth and consistent performance.Eternal also shows a lot of variety in its enemies, slowly ramping up the intensity from shotgun-fodder imps to bigger, stronger, more intimidating creatures. The game's developer, id, has woven these environments, weapons and demons together masterfully, resulting in a wonderfully varied, fast-paced shooter that never stops pushing you toward the next objective.Here’s the thing about the lightspeed pacing of Doom Eternal: For the most part, it's a good thing. It’s easy to lose an afternoon, a day or a weekend in this game, because it’s so satisfying. Every time you think you’re ready to take a break, there’s a new weapon in front of you, or you’ve earned some points to upgrade your armor, or you want to go back and find those last few collectables from a prior mission.While you’re actively engaged in combat, there’s almost no breathing room. As one of the game’s loading screen tips says, if you stop moving, you’ll die. You’ll find yourself dashing, jumping and using teleporters frequently just to stay ahead of the pack, all while switching between weapons on the fly.Despite its frantic nature, fighting enemies in Doom Eternal also requires a good deal of strategy. Most foes have weak points you can target for quicker takedowns, but that’s easier said than done when you’re constantly on the move. Doom’s Glory Kills make their triumphant return, allowing you to stagger enemies, then take them out in one brutal finishing move. So while you’re swarmed, you’ll be managing attacking demons, limited ammunition and keeping your armor and health up.Most battlefields have a decent amount of ammo and health pickups, but often, it’s not enough. The demons will provide the resources you need if you attack them correctly, though. Using Flame Belch to set them on fire drops armor, chainsaw kills provide ammo and Glory Kills give you enough health to stay on your feet just a little bit longer. It feels like a lot to keep track of at first, but when it all clicks, it’s immensely satisfying. Understanding how all of these systems work together is crucial to Doom Eternal’s gameplay, making it a deceptively smart shooter.The game does occasionally give you a few minutes to breathe in the form of surprisingly complex platforming segments. Platforming might seem antithetical to a franchise so deeply rooted in push-forward combat. However, these sections give you a bit of relief between skirmishes, and feel fulfilling in their own right. It feels great to line up a series of perfectly timed jumps, swings and wall grabs, particularly when these skills help you collect the otherwise out-of-reach secrets scattered throughout each level.Doom Eternal is one of the best first-person shooters I’ve ever played, and certainly the most fun I’ve had with the genre in the last few years.For the first 75% percent of the game, Doom Eternal hits that ideal balance of challenging and satisfying. Even if you fail, you’ll want to get right up and try it again, changing up strategies until you break through. However, the last few chapters of the game introduce a difficulty spike that’s less like climbing a steep hill and more like ramming face-first into a wall. In some cases, I spent an hour or more on a single encounter, burning through extra lives (one of the game’s many throwbacks) and reloading over and over again. Some parts were downright cheap, making me feel like more of a puny mortal than a demon-slaying god.The pacing also goes a little wonky at the end, which is a shame because the game progression feels effortless until then. The climax is overly drawn out, tacking on an extra few hours of gameplay that probably weren’t strictly necessary.Doom Eternal is one of the best first-person shooters I’ve ever played, and certainly the most fun I’ve had with the genre in the last few years. For every moment of frustration, there are ten others that will have you cackling in satisfaction as you tear a cacodemon’s eye out of its fleshy face and shove it down its throat. (Come on, that can’t just be me.) It’s a power fantasy, for sure, but it’s not gratuitous or gross. There’s no ambiguity about your actions, and no reason to contemplate whether all the violence is necessary. You’re literally saving Earth from turning into Hell! What could be a more worthy cause?There are lots of other things to love about the game, too, like the thoughtful nods to O.G. Doom and other flagship Bethesda franchises. There are collectable records with music from previous games, hidden toys that make the game's grotesque monsters adorable and plenty of story references to what came before. I also appreciated Doom Eternal's extensive accessibility options, including difficulty levels that you can change on the fly, colorblind mode, subtitles and more.Even now, after spending 25-30 hours playing Doom Eternal — including a couple of all-day marathon sessions — I can’t get it out of my head. All I can think about is the collectibles I missed, the upgrades I didn’t get and how badly I want to keep ripping and tearing. Sure, it’s got some issues sticking the landing, but even so, Doom Eternal will likely keep my attention for a long time to come. Motorola tipped to launch foldable Razr Lite and Plus to fight Galaxy Z Flip 5Google Pixel 8 case leak tips design of new flagshipI hate the idea of an iPhone 15 Pro price hike — but it feels inevitableBy Mike ProsperoApril 10, 2023By Michelle Rae UyApril 09, 2023By Tony PolancoApril 07, 2023By Matthew MurrayApril 07, 2023By Brian NadelApril 05, 2023By Peter WolinskiApril 05, 2023By Jackie DoveApril 05, 2023By Kelly WooApril 05, 2023By Dan CavallariApril 04, 2023By Andrew HaywardApril 04, 2023By Tony PolancoApril 04, 2023Tom's Guide is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

If you don't see it, please check your junk folder.The next issue of Financial Post Top Stories will soon be in your inbox. We encountered an issue signing you up. Please try again With a difficulty option dubbed “I’m Too Young to Die!” and the very first level named “Hell on Earth,” it’s clear from the start that this isn’t going to be a game of mellow, feel-good vibes. That said, it’s so ridiculously violent that it might just provide a welcome bit of catharsis for some.Indeed, Id Software’s latest entry in its seminal first-person shooter franchise is nothing if not a means to purge via the cleansing power of chainsaws, super shotguns, and trusty old BFG-9000s. Nearly every inch of the experience has been architected to keep players eyebrow-deep in the blood and gore of the cacodemons they slaughter. It is endlessly inventive in its scripted animations depicting the impaling, eviscerating, and general rending of demon flesh.In fact, we’re encouraged towards the game’s most vicious violence via a mechanic that rewards us with health, armour, and ammunition (a resource you’ll likely find almost always to be nearly depleted) should we opt for a gratuitous finishing move rather than simply shooting from a distance. Dispatching your enemies by the grisliest means possible isn’t just a guilty pleasure, it’s an essential strategy for survival.Beyond the viscera and carnage is an interactive experience that can only be described as a gamer’s game. Some games make sacrifices to play for the sake of developing story, characters, and worlds. Not Doom Eternal. Its narrative and mythology (delivered mostly via lengthy apocryphal text found on pieces of burnt parchment that are a bit of a slog to read through) are wholly optional. Every design decision feels as though it was made explicitly with action in mind rather than storytelling.The locations we explore, for example, are often pocked with portals, air boosters, and monkey bars, clearly laid out to facilitate satisfying movement and combat rather than to replicate any sort of practical real-world environment. Some areas almost feel as though they were designed for competitive multiplayer rather campaign play.And for the first several levels we are absolutely bombarded with weapons, mods, runes, abilities, and mini-game-like side missions, all of which serve to keep our attention focused squarely on combat, acrobatic environmental traversal (there are times when it almost feels like we’re in a challenging 3D platformer rather than a first-person shooter), and the occasional action-oriented contextual puzzle.In these and other ways, Doom Eternal is clearly an ode to the franchise’s past. It’s loaded with familiar character designs, a complete arsenal of all of the series’ most beloved weapons, and tons of hidden secrets and collectibles. Thankfully, finding this stuff scattered around the game’s sprawling, labyrinthine levels is made a little easier thanks to one of the best in-game maps I’ve yet encountered; a fully navigable 3D recreation of the level that makes it very easy to understand exactly where everything is and how to get to it. You can even use the map to fast-travel to various spots so you can go back and collect anything you might have missed rather than restart the level from scratch.Some players are bound to find it all a little overwhelming. It’s ludicrously fast-paced in spots, and even that “I’m Too Young to Die!” difficulty mentioned above can be surprisingly challenging. Plus, an exceedingly busy heads-up display — crowded with colour-coded icons and numbers meant to relay key information about your weapons, mods, active abilities, perks, and objectives — takes quite awhile to fully interpret and understand.But hopefully the time you invest figuring out how to play won’t feel wasted once you finish the campaign. Id has included a competitive asymmetrical multiplayer mode called Battlemode, where one player takes on the role of the game’s super-powered space marine, going up against pairs of demons controlled by other players. It’s delicately balanced — the space marine is incredibly tough, but the demons can summon helpers and call on special abilities as they cooperate in taking down the Slayer — and looks to offer plenty of opportunity for the development of novel strategies.I didn’t get a chance to experience much of Battlemode during my hurried pre-launch evaluation, but it looks like it will provide good reason for the game’s most ardent fans to keep coming back.Confession time: I’m likely in a miniscule minority of folks who believe Doom peaked back in 2004 with Doom 3, which delivered the franchise’s most thoughtful and compelling narrative to date and a legitimate sense of horror. I call it “the serious Doom.” Had I my druthers, I’d have opted to see the series continue along that path.But Id’s move to make 2016’s Doom and now this direct sequel more reminiscent of the series’ roots is fine, too. Sometimes all a person wants is a way to forget about the rest of the world while mindlessly ripping mancubuses to bloody shreds.

DOOM Eternal,Matt Cox,"Rock, Paper, Shotgun",https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/03/17/doom-eternal-review/,"Absolutely goriousRelease: March 20th
On: Windows
From: Steam
Price: £50/€60/$60Doom Eternal sucks in the whole of you. Fights plunge you into flow states. They send you wading through demonic maelstroms of gristle and gore. You twist and jump and dash, punching, shooting and chainsawing every Cacodemon that should know better than to cross you. I've danced the bloody ballets of hell and beyond, and I've returned to tell you: they are dazzling. It's a lot like the last game, except now the Super Shotgun has a grappling hook.Doom knows what Doom's about. That's clear from the intro, a cold open onto Earth on fire. The demons are back, humanity is on its knees, and building-sized devils stalk through the crumbling ruins of civilisation. Cutting across the remaining humans' cries, as we slow-pan around the Slayer's armour, comes the clanging of heavy metal churning into gear. As is written in the ancient texts: ""there is only one dominant life-form in the universe, and it carries a steel-barrelled sword of vengeance"". That's you, that is.This time, Doomguy gets to escape the dusty colour palettes of Mars and hell. He also gets to teleport between arctic fortresses, the ruins of post-apocalyptic Earth and, memorably, space. That romp through the BFG 10000, a vast orbital artillery piece whose firing periodically basks everything in a glorious green glow, will stay with me. So will cutting my way across Earth, where fallen titans, both infernal and man-made, frequently block your path. At one point you need to jump up to a defunct mech's gun, plug in a power source to make it fire, then stand back as a giant demon's guts gloop out, so you can proceed through his chest cavity. This is one of the least gruesome things you will do in Doom Eternal.  
 
You're an emblem of destruction. An unstoppable force, set free to rip and tear through a cyber-infused menagerie. Movement and murder become one, and it all begins with glory kills.As with Doom 2016, glory kills are the cornerstone of combat, and they never stop forcing you forwards. Drop a demon's health low enough, and they'll stagger. That's your cue to move in and press the button that rips their arms off, or makes them eat their own pulsating heart, or slides a dagger through their jawbone, or, God, so much else. You'll think you've seen every gruesome disassembly, and then you'll find yourself stabbing a jagged femur into a snake-demon's brain. It's very hard not to revel in this. Every glory kill gives you health, letting you bounce back from the edge of disaster. Opportunities are abundant, so danger can be too: your health is designed to be in flux. This system works, and it works well. It resonates. This is how Doomguy fights. Forget about whittling away at health bars from a safe distance, for there is no such thing as a safe distance. Your best bet is to always be right beside the creatures intent on your destruction, where salvation manifests as a fist through an abdomen. 
 
You wind up looking at every enemy as both a threat and a resource, and Doom Eternal doubles down on this by handing you a flamethrower. It's a rechargeable gadget that briefly coats every enemy in fire, and its importance cannot be overstated. Damaging or killing burning enemies makes them drop armour shards, giving you the same dynamic as glory kills, but writ larger. The right tactics let you turn an ocean of enemies into a sea of green, and a springboard into your next group of victims. The Plasma Rifle deserves a special shout out, because it excels at transforming crowds of demons into rejuvenating mist. Nearly every weapon has two additional mods that you can swap between mid-combat by right-clicking, and my preferred option for the plasma gun lets you build up charge by landing shots, before releasing a high-damage blast that vaporises everything in front of you. If you've managed to coat a big bunch of bads in flames, releasing that blast makes for one of the most satisfying right-clicks in video games. 
 
There's more, though: every mod can be upgraded, using tokens handed out as rewards for fighting through levels, completing especially hard bonus encounters, or completing hidden challenges where you need to murder everything within a time limit. Once you've bought all the upgrades for a particular mod, you unlock another challenge that changes each weapon's behaviour yet again. The final upgrade for the heat-blasting version of the Plasma Rifle lets you do extra damage after you fire a fully-charged blast, transforming blue projectiles into deadly red. It is my favourite gun baby, apart from the Super Shotgun.You don't need the Super Shotgun to get around. You run fast and you can dash faster, twice in succession, perhaps chaining them into double-jumps. A completely separate upgrade system can speed you up some more, by letting you equip runes that double the distance from which you can trigger glory kills, or which give you a burst of speed when you perform one. But, as mentioned, the Super Shotgun comes with a grappling hook. It reels you in towards enemies, but it doesn't mess with your momentum, and you can pair it with a rune that slows down time. Slow-motion grappling hook drive-bys are a thing in Doom Eternal, and I implore you to indulge in them.  
 
Even more so than last time round, Doom excels at making failure feel like your fault. You should have switched to a different weapon, you should have dodged, you should have gone in for that glory kill, or not gone in for that glory kill, or not forgotten about your grenades. If only you'd plotted your murder route differently, if only you'd made a dash for that jump pad rather than getting trapped in that corner. Please, do not get trapped in corners. You'll be dead within seconds. I do have a few reservations. I often found myself spotting secret collectables (or more importantly, bonus lives and upgrades) behind bars, and not knowing if I was overlooking a way to get to them that was right in front of me, or if I needed to press on to the next area and double back. That's not a huge deal, but it did make me feel itchy. There are also some frustrating jumping puzzles, some jokes that don't land, and the last level kind of flubs it, by throwing huge hordes at you in cramped areas with nothing to duck behind.  
 
But these are minor transgressions. They don't come close to souring a delightfully bloody pudding, a tour de force of grizzly decapitation. The highs in Doom Eternal come thick and fast and towering, in the midst of battles that demand total attention. New-new Doom nails that marriage of twitching and planning, the calculated deployment of rampant aggression. It makes you feel godly. I haven't been able to try the multiplayer mode, but it promises asymmetric, player-orchestrated arenas that sound much more intriguing than the underwhelming marine-on-marine action of the last game. And if winds up as another disappointing side-show, so what?Doom Eternal is a lot like the last game, but better. Even if the Super Shotgun didn't have a grappling hook, I'd probably call that heaven.You're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!

DOOM Eternal,Austin Fern,GamingTrend,https://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/one-hell-of-a-time-doom-eternal-review/,"DOOM Eternal is bigger and better than DOOM (2016) in every way. It’s fast, bloody, difficult, and hellishly fun. I enjoyed DOOM (2016) but I don’t think I could ever go back. DOOM Eternal adds some much-needed depth to the arena-style shooting and I just can’t get enough.Something you will notice right out the gate is just how much better DOOM Eternal looks. More than just improved graphics, what I noticed most was the incredible scene variety and all the work that went into the backdrops. The backgrounds have incredible scenery, such as giant demons and robots, that made me pause and just take in the sights.I appreciated these moments of downtime because the shooting is just as quick but far more complex than DOOM (2016). I needed these moments just to catch my breath. There are brand new enemies this time around such as the Gargoyle, a flying imp-like creature, The Whiplash, which is a cyber snake, and tentacles! Not the fun kind either, no, these are the ones that just pop out of the ground to attack and are just generally annoying.I love these backgrounds!Along with some new additions are some oldies that didn’t appear in DOOM (2016) such as the Arachnotrons which are brains on four cyber legs that jump around while shooting exploding orbs and a rapid-fire turret. That turret can be trouble, so it’s best to blow it off.Blow it off? Yes! DOOM Eternal introduces enemy weak points. The Arachnotrons have a turret you can blast off to limit their attacks, the Mancubus has two arm cannons, and The Revenant has the two shoulder rockets. Most major demons have a weak spot and I love this idea. It gives combat another layer as you determine which threats you should take out first. Do you want to run around and take out the weapons first or work on killing them and limiting their numbers? It’s a fantastic addition that keeps every battle fresh.Speaking of keeping things fresh and great additions, I really enjoyed the platforming. It does a great job of slowing the pace down at times for you to relax and catch your breath before the next big fight. The monkey bars can send you flying across the battlefield and greatly increase movement. However, it is really funny to picture the big, strong Doom Slayer just swinging on some monkey bars.Platforming and monkey bars aren’t the only new additions. One good addition is the dash ability. Dashing around the battlefield to quickly glory kill a demon or get some needed health is always satisfying. It’s also used in platforming but it doesn’t add a whole bunch here. It can be fun to drop down and dash to a ledge to find a secret, but I prefer its use in battle.The one not as good addition is the blood punch. Your new standard melee attack is drastically weaker to the point that it’s pretty much useless. Instead, you can use glory kills to charge up a Blood Punch. This is a super melee attack that deals damage to all the enemies around you. However, it’s really easy to use by accident as it’s just tied to your normal melee button. I really didn’t care for this addition and would have much preferred having a more powerful standard melee. I mean, you can’t even really kill zombies with it anymore! It makes the Doom Slayer feel weak.Much like DOOM (2016), there is a pretty good story here if you want to partake in it! The lore books are just as interesting to read and I love learning more about the Doom Slayer and the demons he is slaughtering. If reading isn’t your style, however, you can just skip them and get right on with the killing.Want to bet?The story itself follows the Doom Slayer as he attempts to save Earth by killing two demonic priests and defeating Khan Maykr. It’s simple enough, but engaging thanks to some impressive environments and set pieces such as shooting yourself out of a gun to move across a ship or when you first get the BFG. I won’t spoil it, but that is a pretty great moment. Most importantly, the Doom Slayer’s attitude has returned. He does not care about anything other than slaying demons and it is great.Ah yes, what would the Doom Slayer be without his weapons? Those are pretty much exactly the same from DOOM (2016). The Super Shotgun gets a hook now that you can use to pull yourself closer to an enemy, but weapons are the one area that hasn’t drastically improved. Not that that’s much of a problem since the weapons are just as fun as they were in DOOM (2016). You do have less ammo this time around though so be prepared to use all the weapons at your disposal.While not guns, the Doom Slayer did bring a little extra to his arsenal of weapons. The flame belch allows you to set demons on fire which causes them to drop armor. You get an ice grenade this time around that freezes enemies in place. You will need to use these to survive. While the complexity makes DOOM Eternal engaging, it can also make it difficult. You have a lot of new toys and it can take some time to figure everything out. Even your old friend, the chainsaw, is a bit different this time. Instead of collecting canisters, you have one bar that regenerates over time. While you can still collect canisters to get three bars, I almost never did this. I needed the ammo the chainsaw gives too often to save it.I actually love these toys and I want some in real life.Okay fine. I’ll talk about the multiplayer. It’s…not great. After playing some rounds as both demon and Slayer, I didn’t care much for it. The balancing is really off. Almost every match I played the Slayer won. Demons just don’t do enough damage and get killed way too quickly. The Slayer is just far too powerful. I’m certainly not going to come back for the multiplayer.I am, however, going to return. I have some collectibles to collect and Slayer Gates to slay. Slayer Gates are new additions that offer very difficult combat encounters for those looking to test their mettle. They are great fun, but I suggest coming back after you beat the game and are properly upgraded. Collectibles are expanded upon to include toys of enemies this time around! They are adorable and I love them. Thankfully, collecting them can be quite fun! One of the new secrets are cheat codes! You can get things like infinite lives and ammo and just burn through levels looking for collectibles.Don’t worry, DOOM Eternal doesn’t introduce a lives mechanic. That I would not enjoy. Instead, dotted around the levels are “extra lives” which allow you to instantly respawn and continue the fight rather than reloading a checkpoint. This is a great way to keep the pace going and is a fine reward for players willing to explore. Exploring all these little secrets is also much easier with the new quick travel mechanic. Once you get near the end of the level, you can warp back to previous places and pick up anything you may have missed.DOOM Eternal is drastically better than DOOM (2016), which was already an incredible game. Some players may not enjoy just how much more complex DOOM Eternal is, but I find it addicting. This is one of the best shooters I’ve ever played.DOOM Eternal is drastically better than DOOM (2016), which was already an incredible game.

DOOM Eternal,Tom Hoggins,Telegraph,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/features/doom-eternal-review-cathartic-cacophony-violence/,"Older readers may remember the notoriety of the original Doom, one of the forerunners of the first-person shooter that sent players to hell and back, turning demons into kibble at the end of a floating shotgun. Its diabolical setting and relentless blasting was something of a spark for moral panic around video games that has never truly dissipated.The difference now, perhaps, is that many video game developers have simply stopped giving a stuff. Doom Eternal, like the series successful 2016 reboot, is an orgiastic cacophony of violence. A relentless parade of mulching demons with enormous guns soundtracked by Mick Gordon’s thunderous, escalating heavy metal.As the Doom Slayer, your giant fists swing across the screen like cannonballs, yanking the legs off skittering brain-spiders and jamming it back through their eyeball, feeding a mancubus its own heart or dissecting fodder with a roaring chainsaw. It is relentlessly noisy, gleefully gory and, yes, splendid fun.There is barely a whiff of exposition before the game puts a shotgun in your hands and asks you to squish demons in an ornate cathedral that wouldn’t look out of place on a Slayer album cover (an aesthetic running right through the entire game). The set-up is simple. Demons have invaded Earth and decimated humanity, it is up to you to fight back; finding the demon high priests and separating their heads from their bodies.The ferocious gratification that the combat brings comes from its own bristling eco-system, relentless crowds of ghouls smooshed with quick fingers and quick thinking. Resources can be extracted from your prey as quickly as it is depleted, as long as you follow its simple rules. Move in for a brutal ‘Glory Kill’ and -after thumping their head through their chest- they will explode in a shower of blood and blue health; rip through them with a chainsaw and ammo falls out; set them aflame and they drop armour.It is a blissfully simple rhythm, but one that opens up the gunplay by encouraging experimentation and variety, allayed to a frantic back and forth as you switch between offense to wipe out the heavier demons and falling back, mulching fodder in order to stock up.That variety is bolstered by a drip-feed of new enemies that often require a change of tactics, some susceptible to different weapons -a long range sniper-bullet shearing off weak spots, for instance, or a plasma gun overheating demon shields. Ammo is ripped through between restocks, making switching between its heavy-duty and exotic arsenal a must.While you may have a favourite gun, you will find yourself rotating weapons through both bullet scarcity and a quick change in tactic to deal with a new beast. Further wrinkles come in Runes to activate new skills -slowing time while aiming in mid-air, or increasing the reach of your glory kills- and weapon mods unlocked through good performance. While it has that now laborious sense of video game feature creep, throwing endless options at you in packed menus, that most of it is in service to its gunplay obsession is to its credit.That said, when Doom Eternal steps away from the fight, it can’t help but stumble. There are some laborious platforming sections, no doubt intended as a palate cleanser between limb-snappings, that are simply not good enough to be anything other than an irritation. The Doom Slayer’s newfound athleticism -which sees you able to swing off bars and scamper up pockmarked walls- is a boon in combat but his Super Mario impression leaves much to be desired.You can understand the intention, with perhaps a concern that some will find the relentless ripping and tearing a bit too much. But, honestly, that’s what you are signing up for with Doom. And id’s talent at pouring so much pleasure and variety into gunplay is more than enough, keeping its surroundings mixed up too; from gooey living corridors to demon-infested office blocks and snow-capped celestial hangouts. Nothing wrong with excelling at one thing. And when it comes to cathartic, gore-fuelled gunplay, there is none better.Doom Eternal is out now for PS4, Xbox One, PC and Google Stadia"
DOOM Eternal,Jay Castello,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/mar/19/doom-eternal-review,"Nintendo Switch, PC, PS4, Xbox One; BethesdaThe latest addition to the demon-slaying franchise is a gorgeously designed gore fest that delivers relentless funPicking up where the 2016 reboot of Doom left off, Doom Eternal offers the merest breath of exposition before you’re handed a shotgun and required to start blasting through demons at breakneck speed. And that’s absolutely fine. Combat is quick, movement is quicker, and both come together in spectacular fights where hundreds of powerful enemies dispatched by the protagonist Doom Slayer – unless he stands still for a fraction of a second.As in Doom, clever tricks encourage risky, aggressive, thrill-seeking play. Low-health enemies can be ripped apart by up close and personal attacks – “glory kills” – which drop health, encouraging the player not to retreat in the face of danger but to instead get closer.It’s a spectacle of violence, but one with impeccable design. Each arena offers clever verticality, meaning constant movement in three dimensions. The game’s heavy-metal soundtrack urges the player onward, while the rest of the sound design offers plenty of gory rips and squelches, but also the sharp smash of a collapsing statue or the echo of the Doom Slayer’s footsteps in a high-ceilinged corridor.But while the previous title felt like it outstayed its welcome in the latter half, Doom Eternal never gets old despite its longer play time. Though the foundation of the fighting might be the same, there’s far more variety to keep it fresh throughout. Some of that is within the combat itself, such as new enemies that require specific techniques to overcome and different kinds of encounters that put imaginative spins on the otherwise formulaic waves of increasing difficulty.There are also multiple upgrade systems for weapons, abilities and suit, gained through ordinary progression as well as completing optional challenges. And Eternal intersperses the familiar scorched red wastelands or gore hives with missions that take place in ivy-wrapped ruins or snowy expanses; it’s just as well that there’s a photo mode to take advantage of them.The game offers many quieter interludes to take in the scenery, too. Hidden secrets and mandatory platforming challenges use all of the Slayer’s additional movement abilities and offer light puzzles to break up the relentless speed, cleverly pacing out the game’s most intense moments.Combat and platforming are meticulously tuned. Hitboxes, on both enemies and grabbable walls, are forgiving enough to afford a constant sense of mastery over the building blocks of the Slayer’s kit. And there are other systems in place to keep the player moving along and prevent any frustration. Difficulty modes can be switched on the fly without affecting progression, and any cheat codes found hidden away are also fine to use throughout the campaign. Dying multiple times on a boss fight unlocks the option to take hugely reduced damage. Though it’s possible to crank up the difficulty and play to erase any mistake, doing so isn’t necessary to enjoy the feeling of power it affords.For those who do want to overcome the tougher challenges, the multiplayer “battlemode” will allow players to face one another as either the Slayer or the demons. (Servers weren’t available during the review period.)But it’s the momentum of the single-player experience that makes Doom Eternal a joy – both within fights and in the broader pacing. Though the story is vague, it doesn’t matter. The Slayer’s indifference to it is showcased throughout; his desire is clearly only to keep moving to end the demonic invasion. The reaction of other characters to his presence also adds some excellent comedy.Doom Eternal is clearly a continuation of the franchise, but it is also a clear improvement on its predecessor. Every design detail serves to propel the player forwards with as little friction as possible, with enough surprises and twists to prevent the formula becoming stale. It’s a real delight to be the Doom Slayer: to put everything else aside and focus on just the problem in front of you. Especially if that problem is a swarm of angry demons."

Here’s how it works.DOOM (2016) was a bit of a surprise hit, and far exceeded many people's expectations. Reboots of classic, beloved franchises are tricky to pull off well, but id Software did an amazing job, reclaiming its shooter crown in the process.DOOM Eternal was announced a while back, following the success of its predecessor. DOOM Eternal follows similar cues to DOOM II: Hell on Earth from the mid-nineties, where forces of evil invade our world. The core premise remains unchanged: rip and tear. And in that goal, DOOM Eternal soars.With stunning art, an amazing soundtrack, and an explosive arsenal, wreaking havoc on demons never felt so good. However, some of the ""new"" gameplay elements and design choices id Software introduces feel like a step back, rather than a step forward.$60 (opens in new tab)Bottom line: DOOM marches back to the gates of hell with confidence, but some of its attempts to try new things fall flat. Literally.Art, gunplay, and soundDOOM Eternal is a truly beautiful game, in the most diabolical sense. The art team really had a field day with DOOM Eternal, pushing established concepts of Hell and body horror to their most delectable limits.Towers of writhing flesh mounds pocked with vile jagged teeth, fallen demonic titans spewing entrails across the entire area, creating environmental hazards in the process. Huge vistas of bleak hellscapes, with demonic tendrils towering into the sky. There's a screenshot opportunity every few minutes in DOOM Eternal, if you have the stomach for its grotesque majesty.Complimenting the visual direction is great sound treatment from Mick Gordon, whose new tracks for DOOM Eternal ramp up and down as the action gets more intense, with an explosive fusion of metal and industrial overtones. It's another flawless victory for DOOM's music, which has almost become the game's calling card in recent years.The performance of the game is stellar as well, running at dynamic 4K with a rock-solid sixty frames per second on Xbox One X. Not once did I experience even the vaguest hint of performance degradation even in some of the games most intensive fights in later levels, making DOOM Eternal one of the most impressive games in terms of fluidity in recent memory. Graphically the game is a massive step up in general, having gone back to do direct comparisons with DOOM 2016. The texture pop-in that plagued the last game is completely eliminated, and the overall presentation is far more detailed.Throughout my time with the campaign, I only encountered a couple of bugs, where a specific shotgun upgrade wouldn't work, and a specific upgrade station wouldn't work. Additionally, I only experienced a single crash, which may have been an issue with Xbox's fast resume rather than the game itself.DOOM Eternal changes up the franchise's gunplay a bit, putting a bigger emphasis on the chainsaw as a means of replenishing ammo. Now, you're pretty much expected to saw a hapless ambient demon in half every now and then, with rapidly replenishing fuel to keep you going. You also have an array of new toys to play with, including a shoulder-mounted gun module that can spread grenades, ice bombs, or spray fire in an area of effect. The flamethrower is particularly important since it causes armor shards to drop off enemies to help you stay alive.Getting used to the new flow of combat took a while, particularly since my muscle memory was still very much stuck in 2016, but after a bit of practice, I found myself carving through hordes of demonic entities with reckless abandon. The violent ballet that is so very uniquely DOOM achieves all new heights, with new weapons like the Ballista that can cut an entire room of demons in half, with new weapon mods to keep returning weapons fresh.Additionally, DOOM Eternal dials up the gore to a whole other level. Shooting enemies will gradually peel the flesh off their bones in chunks until their guts and sinews are dangling around, and contextual gore for specific weapons and finishing moves make combat varied and satisfying. Anyone who felt like DOOM 2016 wasn't bloody enough is about to get a big payday.Speaking of weapon mods, the new Super Shotgun grappling hook is more than just a tool of destruction. It can be used to pull you out of harm's way. It can bring you into close quarters with a fodder demon for a quick chainsawin', or a health-regenerating execution. With upgrades, it can also set demons on fire, granting you a boost of armor as you cut them down with a hail of shotgun blasts.Used in combination with jumps, it can also be used as a tool to gain higher ground. One of the runes you can gather that grant passive bonuses let you slow-down time as you use alt-fire while in the air, effectively letting you create Matrix-like scenes as you soar through the air, carving bloody patterns with the giblets of your enemies.Source: Windows CentralEach level is full of secrets to unlock and uncover, to be displayed inside Doomguy's central hub of operations, although it's a bit of a spoiler exactly how that works, DOOM Eternal makes its unlockables and collectibles rewarding to unearth. I collected what felt like quite a ton of stuff throughout the campaign, many of which are celebrations of past id Software titles from the DOOM legacy, with a bit of Quake and Wolfenstein here and there. There are easter eggs everywhere too, and I'm looking forward to seeing what more observant players unearth in the coming weeks.DOOM Eternal is another goretastically-satisfying shooter from id Software, with jaw-dropping vistas, stomach-churning monsters, with some of the meatiest, smoothest gunplay around. As great as DOOM Eternal's core aspects are, some of the attempts to diversify the gameplay don't land as well as I expect id Software hoped.Platforming, level design, story deliveryNothing here is what I consider a deal-breaker for DOOM Eternal. Truly, if you loved 2016's take, you're going to love this one too. However, I do want to air some grievances about the game, across aspects that I felt really held it back as an overall package.I'm not sure anyone played DOOM 2016 and thought ""this game needs more platforming.""For some reason, DOOM Eternal puts a big emphasis on platforming. Clunky, awful, platforming. The Super Shotgun's grappling hook gives Doomguy new feats of agility, it plays no part whatsoever in the game's strange insistence on forcing you to scurry awkwardly along inexplicably obvious climbing walls, cavort on monkey bars, and double-jump and double-dash across levels. Towards the end of the game, the game even gives you literal hoops to jump through to get back to the action.I reinstalled DOOM 2016 to see if I was simply being crazy, but where the previous game split the action up between encounter scenarios and exploration in large, sprawling levels, DOOM Eternal's epic combat segments are separated by these odd platforming segments and tedious water displacement puzzles that feel like they'd be more at home in Tomb Raider.The fact you don't die from failing a platforming section, but merely teleport back to the spot you fell, is almost like an apologetic admission that they aren't fun to participate in. I'm not sure anyone played DOOM 2016 and thought ""this game needs more platforming.""While the art is incredible, and DOOM Eternal really outdoes itself with some of its scenery and set-pieces, the level layouts are fairly linear in their progression. It also feels like there's less ambient storytelling in DOOM Eternal, which is a bit of a weak point for the game in general.DOOM has never been known as a story-based title, but it's a bit odd how many important plot details were buried away in text-heavy codex entries in this one. I had to dive back into the codex after I had finished the game just to try and work out what had just transpired, given that so little of it really shines through in the game itself. It's a shame too, since the body of lore id Software is building for this incarnation of DOOM is incredibly rich and detailed. If you're willing to hunt down and read the text logs, that is. I would genuinely like to see DOOM take itself a bit more seriously in this regard, but I may be in the minority there.Finally, as of writing, I was unable to test out DOOM Eternal's ""Battlemode,"" as the servers are unpopulated. I did however try out the offline tutorial. Battlemode is a new 2v1 PvP multiplayer mode that lets two player demons battle against a single player Doomguy. You can spawn enemies in and utilize various demonic abilities while battling the Doom Slayer. I'll write up some thoughts on that in a future article, once the servers are populated. It might provide some fleeting fun as a mini-game, but it doesn't seem particularly groundbreaking, and it certainly doesn't represent the meat of DOOM Eternal — by far, that is the campaign.If you loved DOOM 2016, you simply have to buy DOOM Eternal. The gunplay achieves all-new heights, with new gore mechanics, spectacular new weaponry, and varied demons from DOOM's vast back catalog (as well as some new ones, no spoilers though, sorry!)While the story delivery takes even more of a back seat in DOOM Eternal, id Software still delivers some impressive setpieces, epic boss battles, and stunning scenery, as the forces of Hell begin to devour our world.I can't help but wonder why id Software felt the need to triple-down on the mild platforming elements DOOM 2016 introduced, because all they do is add road bumps to where you really want to be — in the midst of the DOOM hellscape, ripping and tearing demonic creatures from the depths. Thankfully, DOOM Eternal brings plenty of that. And then some.Rip and tearAnother solid id shooter.id Software brings another smorgasbord of destruction to the plate with DOOM Eternal, a veritable canteen of carnage, full of good gaming protein.DOOM Eternal was reviewed on Xbox One X using a copy provided by the publisher.Jez Corden a Managing Editor at Windows Central, focusing primarily on all things Xbox and gaming.

DOOM Eternal,John-Paul Jones,PlayStation Universe,https://www.psu.com/reviews/doom-eternal-review-ps5/," John-Paul Jones / June 30, 2021DOOM Eternal PS5 Review. The consummate poster-boy for ridiculously fast and unendingly brutal FPS violence set against the energizing thrum of Mick Gordon’s expertly composed soundtrack, DOOM Eternal rips and tears its way onto PlayStation 5, bringing with it from the depths of Hell the sort of upgrades that one would duly expect.Given that we’ve already put DOOM Eternal through its paces and that this review will be exclusively focused on the technical improvements seen in the PS5 version, we would point the uninitiated to our original DOOM Eternal review on PS4 for the complete lowdown on the game mechanics and so forth. Still here? Onward then!Though the PS5 version of DOOM Eternal is somewhat predictably a whole lot shinier and certainly appreciably easier on the eyes than the PS4 version of the game, it’s a testament to the absolute black wizardry of developers id Software that because they overachieved on Sony’s last gen console, DOOM Eternal on PS5 doesn’t feel like quite such a sizable leap that it otherwise may have done.So in terms of visual bang for your buck, DOOM Eternal presents players with three different visual modes on PS5. The first of these is the balanced visual preset, which keeps the resolution locked at 4K and with a solid 60 frames per second to boot. Arguably the most conservative of the three modes, this is where DOOM Eternal on PS5 doesn’t feel like such a big leap over what we’ve seen before, not least because the PS4 Pro version already ran at 60 frames per second and at 4K upscaled from 1440p.Further Reading:It’s when we start to look toward the remaining two visual modes that DOOM Eternal on PS5 begins to make a proper justification for its own existence, though whether or not your TV is up to the task will define whether that statement is wholly or just partially true; which brings me to the 120 frames per second mode. Only available to those among us that are lucky enough to have a HDMI 2.1 compliant display, DOOM Eternal running at 120 frames per second feels like a proper underscoring of the lightning quick and ultra furious FPS violence that the game’s appeal is arguably predicated upon.This is thanks in no small part to the fact that when running in the 120 frames per second mode, the level of responsiveness feels much more keenly palpable than it does at 60 frames per second, enabling wannabe and practiced Doom Slayers to fully embrace the beautifully developed tenets of DOOM Eternal’s exemplary gameplay loop with ease. Quite simply, chainsawing an Imp in twain before shooting a sticky grenade to the tail of an Arachnotron and then curb-stomping an enemy grunt has never felt quite this smooth (or satisfying).What’s also notable about DOOM Eternal’s 120 frames per second mode, and again this falls once more to the seemingly infinite talents of the folks at id Software, is that on PS5 the whole thing is rendered at 1584p resolution, resulting in a far cleaner image than the often forced 1080p preset which this high performance mode usually forces from other games.Then there’s the ray tracing visual preset. Locking down the resolution to a still pleasing 1800p and the frame rate to 60 frames per second, DOOM Eternal’s ray tracing mode is certainly a sight to behold in varying circumstances. Puddles and other reflective surfaces now do a much better job of sharply and accurately representing the immediate vicinity, while the greatly improved lighting results in more natural seeming effects that add richness and depth to the scene (honestly, you’ve kinda never lived until you’ve seen an Imp’s fireball lighting up all the surfaces around it and being reflected in all the right places as it hurtles toward you).Further Reading:Where DOOM Eternal’s newly discovered ray tracing mode begins to act against the core of the game is in terms of performance. While the drop to 60 frames per second is perfectly acceptable (the PS4 and PS4 Pro versions ran at this framerate after all), the occasional dropped frames from that 60 frames per second cap do distract and are definitely noticeable after exposure to the performance and balanced visual presets.Away from the visual improvements, DOOM Eternal’s PS5 debut also brings DualSense support to the fore with haptic feedback and the adaptive triggers being leveraged in satisfying, though hardly surprising ways every time you get hit or let rip with a barrage of ammunition in the direction of your foes.Like so many PS5 upgrades to date then, DOOM Eternal’s appearance on PlayStation 5 serves more to put a polish steeped shine to the underlying game (DOOM Eternal is still one of the best shooters you can buy on any platform), rather than add anything especially significant to the base offering above and beyond the usual presentation and DualSense improvements. And you know what? That’s completely fine, because now DOOM Eternal also gets to be one of the best shooters on PS5. How about that?DOOM Eternal is out now on PS4 and PS5. If you own the PS4 version of DOOM Eternal, you get the PS5 version for free.Original review code kindly provided by PR.DOOM Eternal on PS5 quite simply underscores the already lofty calibre of one of the best shooters ever with a delectable coat of visual polish which keeps id Software's PlayStation swansong ripping and tearing among the very best of its genre contemporaries.

DOOM Eternal,Sean Colleli,Gaming Nexus,https://www.gamingnexus.com/Article/6086/DOOM-Eternal/,"Id Software’s 2016 reboot of DOOM is about as close to a perfect game as you can get. Id cut through the noise and confusion of their early-to-mid 2000s experimentation and delivered an experience that felt like the fruition of everything they'd worked on before. The beating, cybernetic heart of the original Doom shone through, along with the essence of Quake, Rage, and even the narrative flourishes from Machinegames’ Wolfenstein: The New Order. The result was an almost perfectly balanced, single-player-focused first-person shooter, the culmination of everything id had ever made in one relentlessly refined work of art. DOOM 2016 remains one of my favorite games of all time; I try to replay it on Ultra Violence difficulty at least once annually.Four years (and one lengthy delay) later and DOOM’s sequel, DOOM Eternal, is finally upon us. I can’t think of a game I’ve anticipated more feverishly, aside from maybe Metroid Prime 4. But as Mr. Spock wisely once said: “…You may find that ‘having’ is not so pleasing a thing after all as ‘wanting.’ It is not logical, but it is often true.”This is not to say that DOOM Eternal is a bad game. Quite the opposite, in fact, and I don’t want to bury the lede by spilling my guts out here. In fact, my editor had this to say after my eight-page exegesis on Doom 2016, paraphrased: “Great job, excellent thoughts. Don’t do it again.” In short, DOOM Eternal is a complicated game, and as a result I have complicated feelings about it. But let’s start with the good here.I typically end my reviews talking about production values because, pound for pound, I find them the least important aspect of a game. But for graphics, sound and engine design alone, id deserves Game of the Year accolades. I thought DOOM 2016 and its id Tech 6 engine were well optimized—id renderers have a reputation for being extremely stable and scalable—but id Tech 7 blows it away at every level. Id has stripped away the last vestiges of old engine tech, like the diminishing returns, neck-bound albatross that was Megatexture, and as a result Doom Eternal displays a peerless level of geometric and texture detail in both tight quarters and stunning open vistas.The first time I stalked up onto a ridge and got an eyeful of the shattered, demon-ravaged horizon of downtown Dallas in the full throes of Hell on Earth, I had to pause the game and pick my jaw and eyeballs up off the floor. What’s really impressive is that DOOM Eternal runs at a near rock-solid 60 frames per second no matter what you’re doing; you could be gazing out into a mile-long draw distance or embroiled in a white knuckle skirmish with upwards of 30 demons all popping off effects-heavy projectiles and explosions. Id Tech 7 handles it all without breaking a sweat, and that’s on my increasingly long-in-the-tooth five-year-old rig playing at high detail settings. I’m sorely tempted to dump my COVID-19 stimulus check into a Ryzen 9 CPU and an RTX 2060, crank the settings up to Ultra Nightmare and really let DOOM Eternal off the chain. But I digress.DOOM Eternal’s art direction matches its technical prowess. One of the few criticisms I can level at DOOM 2016 is that it had a pretty homogeneous color palette: red, silver, gray and brown, with occasional flashes of green and yellow. It was pretty and insanely detailed, but lacked variety. DOOM Eternal pushes art variety considerably and, without going into spoilers, you visit a pretty wild selection of locales, from the aforementioned destroyed Earth to the homeworld of the Night Sentinels, hinted at in DOOM 2016 and glimpsed in DOOM Eternal’s trailers. Enemy art has been improved as well, with many of the demons hewing closer to their classic 256-color designs but with a level of detail and animation that is almost hard to believe, even when you’re looking right at it. Like DOOM 3 before it, at the very least DOOM Eternal is a masterpiece of the video game art form.On the audio front, Mick Gordon has outdone himself. He took the minor criticisms for his DOOM 2016 soundtrack to heart, and DOOM Eternal’s music ditches most of the dubstep and leans heavy on the power metal. Eternal’s soundtrack is intense but operatic, at times moving into power ballad territory; it even has well-known metal vocalists contributing to an unholy choir that swells and shrieks at the culmination of particularly brutal engagements. DOOM Eternal’s whole conceit is that you ain’t on Mars anymore, you’re in the middle of a war between gods and dimensions, heaven and hell, with Earth caught in the middle. If DOOM 2016’s aesthetic was “chrome-plated '80s metal album cover,” DOOM Eternal is a chrome-plated '80s metal album cover, made cybernetic flesh and metal incarnate, and holy hell does Mick Gordon’s soundtrack just sell it. I also really appreciated the subtle hints and motifs he included from the '90s DOOM games, which establish a melodic continuity that made me a very happy id fanboy.So I love DOOM Eternal’s looks and sound, but my feelings start to get complicated when I move on to the gameplay. Remember, DOOM 2016 is in my humble opinion about as close to perfect as it gets. I was assuming that DOOM Eternal would be a natural evolution of that gameplay, and to a degree it is, but in a few ways is both truncates and over-complicates matters, rubbing me the wrong way. For starters, DOOM Eternal is difficult—savagely so. I don’t want to fall into the dreaded game journalist stereotype and opine that, “DOOM Eternal is the Dark Souls of first-person shooters,” but I will go so far to presume that many at id are into their FromSoftware. This is fine, and I assumed that I would pick up where I left off with DOOM 2016, maybe improve my speed and accuracy a bit.Wrong. DOOM Eternal takes the difficulty curve where it ended in DOOM 2016—that is to say, briskly challenging, and roughly ramps up from there. I started DOOM Eternal on Ultra Violence difficulty but, three levels in, for the sake of my blood pressure and getting this review finished in a timely manner, I had to back it down to Hurt Me Plenty (medium difficulty) and for the remainder I flat refused to crank it any lower, as a matter of professional pride. Again I stress that this is fine, but the way in which this difficulty is balanced and implemented is not-so-fine, at least in respect to DOOM 2016 and its difficulty tuning.DOOM Eternal takes many of the tactics and gameplay strategies I developed in DOOM 2016, throws them out the window, and then forces me to adapt to it. I didn’t just have to get faster and more accurate, I had to change the way I think and play. To be fair DOOM Eternal gives you a lot of new guns and toys to play with. You get the flame belch, which makes enemies bleed armor shards when they are alight. You get a grenade cannon that can launch standard frag or ice grenades. You get the blood punch, which charges up from glory kills and can devastate crowds of small to medium demons. This is all fun to use, but DOOM Eternal and its more challenging enemies limit how you can use some of these tools, and funnels you down some frustratingly narrow gameplay avenues.Let me start with the ammo economy, which was the most jarring change for me. DOOM Eternal’s combat still takes place largely in huge killbox arenas that lock down until you’ve murdered all the demons inside. Ammo is very scarce inside these arenas, but frustratingly plentiful in the interconnecting paths and corridors in between. However, demons still erupt into a geyser of munitions when killed with the chainsaw, so in heated combat this makes you rely heavily on that chainsaw. Thankfully it recharges one fuel cell after a relatively brief cooldown, but your overreliance on this vital tool means you hardly ever have enough fuel charges to deal with big demons. This in all practical terms eliminates the chainsaw as a last-ditch “enemy deleter” for tough, extremely dangerous miniboss enemies.Exacerbating this problem is your minuscule ammo carrying capacity, which brings me to my gripes with your character and weapon upgrades and how they’re balanced. You start off being able to carry a measly 16 shotgun shells, and even after you apply the game’s four capacity upgrades, your grand total carry for shells is 24. Max ammo for the other weapons is more generous, but this still forces you to go for ammo capacity upgrades before health or armor and, regardless, you’re always leaning on that chainsaw to stay in the fight. You’re also basically required to execute as many glory kills as possible, because as relentless as the demons are, you’re constantly losing health and armor to attrition. To a degree at least, this dilutes the purity of the game’s shooting action, and it’s sure to piss off fans who were already annoyed at the prevalence of glory kills in DOOM 2016.This precarious health-armor-ammo tap dance gets worse when it comes to the special challenges and Slayer gates—hidden gore nests that offer tough optional fights and upgrades—because if you die during a special challenge, you’re robbed of whatever ammo you expended during the failed attempt. You hit a diminishing returns wall that penalizes you for trying to get better, making ammo this weird pseudo-scarce currency that should be fairly common in a DOOM game. The whole rock-paper-scissors conceit of constantly depleting resources definitely keeps you on your toes in any large scale skirmish, but at the cost of the balance and elegance that made DOOM 2016’s combat so effortlessly addictive.Weapon and suit upgrades have their own bugbears. I quickly learned that ice grenades were a vital tool for snatching some breathing room during a difficult fight, or weakening some of the game’s crueler demons, like Barons and Arch Viles. This necessitated that I sink suit upgrades into ice grenades before frag grenades or secret hunting buffs or even basic stat boosts like quicker movement and weapon switching. This also applied to weapon mods. For example, the assault rifle’s micro missile attachment was one of my favorite mods in DOOM 2016. It ate ammo like wasabi peas, but was excellent for broad suppression of medium to large demons like Hell Knights and could gib irritating long-range imps with a single shot.Naturally it was the first mod I chose for the heavy cannon in DOOM Eternal, only to realize it’s more or less useless. It’s much less likely to stagger bigger demons and it does considerably less damage than before. What’s more, demons now have weak points on their weapons; blasting the flamethrowers off a Mancubus, or the rocket launchers off a Revenant, or even the plasma cannon off an Arachnotron is basically a requirement for surviving the mid to late game. You can do this with the shotgun’s sticky bombs, but they’re slow and, as mentioned, you’re likely to be fresh out of shotgun ammo. The heavy cannon’s sniper scope is fast, accurate and tailor-made for blasting heavy demon guns, making it indispensable. Id’s combat rebalance elevated the heavy cannon sniper mod into a vital tool, but in the process they nerfed my beloved micro missiles into near uselessness.The worst example of this is id’s clearly conflicted feelings about the super shotgun. On the one hand it’s this legendary icon of the DOOM brand and one of the most satisfying guns in FPS history, but on the other hand, the developers admitted they were annoyed by how players over-relied upon it in DOOM 2016. So in DOOM Eternal, the super shotgun is even more super, with a grappling hook that can let you sail across an arena while setting your hapless target on fire…but the gun itself is stymied by that infuriating 24-shell max capacity. What’s more, most enemies have a brutal melee counter that eats half your health if you try to get close enough to effectively blast them with the super shotgun. This turns the super shotgun from DOOM’s iconic workhorse into “a sometimes treat” as Cookie Monster might say, and overall the gun’s place and purpose in DOOM Eternal feels vague and confused.This is exemplified when DOOM Eternal introduces the Marauder, a brutally challenging demon that’s basically one of your former Night Sentinel comrades turned to the Dark Side of the Force. The game goes out of its way to indicate that the super shotgun is the best weapon for dealing with these fast, wily Slayer-hunters, but the use range and speed of the super shotgun feels all wrong for putting down a Marauder quickly and cleanly. Marauders are lightning fast, spawn ghost hellhounds to harass you, bust your chops with a shotgun if you get any closer than medium range, and will block all your shots with an impenetrable shield unless you strike right as they drop their guard for a brief instant to attack. They’re a brilliantly designed enemy and a fun miniboss to fight, but they were a rage-quit-inducing pain in my butt until I realized the ballista (Eternal’s replacement for the gauss cannon) was the best gun to counter them with. The super shotgun is too slow, too close-range and too short on ammo, and not just for Marauders but for a lot of combat encounters. My poor girl feels less like a reliable hunting partner and more like a tired old dog, ready for retirement, and that’s pretty disheartening.To sum up, DOOM Eternal does away with one of my favorite aspects of DOOM 2016: the ability to build your own DOOM Slayer, to tailor your weapon, character and stat upgrades to your own personal play style. Instead DOOM Eternal lays down some very firm gameplay rules—some stated outright, others more obtuse, but all mandatory—and expects you to conform to them. This makes some character and gun upgrades less than useful; rely on those micro missiles, or forego glory kills and chainsaw for straight-up shooting, and you’re gonna have a bad time. It also makes hunting out secrets and upgrades almost necessary, because going into the late game without those hidden Slayer crystals or Sentinel seals is like…well, walking into Hell naked. To be fair, DOOM Eternal’s level design is brilliantly vertical and labyrinthine, even more Metroid Prime-esque than the last game, with twisting hidden passages and majestic open spaces replete with tricky platforming strung across breathtaking architecture. Hunting for secrets is a joy, I just wish it wasn’t necessary to long-term survival.To be even fairer, DOOM Eternal is still quite enjoyable once you learn to play by its rules. I rage-quit a few times and had to reevaluate my tactics and weapon use, then returned with my bloodlust refreshed and some novel ways to use my ice grenades or shotgun meat hook. Finally conquering a battle that had handed me my rear end a half-dozen times was immensely satisfying. That said, unless you play by those rules and get exceedingly good at playing by those rules, DOOM Eternal does not feel like a freeform combat dance like DOOM 2016, but more like a back alley knife fight with a half-dozen opponents. It’s a beatdown, not a rush, and in the context of the greater narrative it makes sense; the demons are terrified of the DOOM Slayer and fight brutally—desperately—when they encounter you. But it does make DOOM Eternal less of a gleeful rip-and-tear joy than its predecessor.I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention that narrative, while avoiding spoilers of course. DOOM 2016 ingeniously shuffled most of the plot off to the side in optional audio logs and text dumps, for you to peruse at your leisure. It kept things like cutscenes and monologues out of the way of the carnage, which was the main draw after all. DOOM Eternal is, once again, more complicated. It starts in medias res with the DOOM Slayer in a wicked awesome Sentinel castle, in orbit above the demon-besieged Earth...and with no explanation as to how he escaped Samuel Hayden’s imprisonment and acquired said space castle. The Slayer’s mission is to kill the Hell priests orchestrating the invasion of Earth, but the game drops you into battle without much context and you really have to piece things together from there.In all fairness the plot eventually gets really quite good, with some twists that are very satisfying for longtime fans. There’s a lot of depth here but the story is told out of order, and unless you take the time to read those text logs you’re going to be a little lost. That said, I really enjoyed the lore they’re expanding here; the cosmic horror, gothic undertones and gods vs. monsters grandeur makes me think this is what a very frustrated John Romero was attempting with the original Quake, before throwing up his hands and leaving id in the late '90s. In fact, I would love to see modern id do a soft reboot of Quake, and maybe even Quake II (under its much cooler original working title Wor), and tie all of that into the expansive narrative they’ve built for DOOM. Yes I’m an enormous nerd, but an id Cinematic Universe where the DOOM Slayer and the Quake Ranger have a crossover sounds pretty cool to me. As it stands, however, DOOM Eternal is a love letter to id history and its fans, with plenty of Easter eggs and tongue-in-cheek references to the id pantheon of IP for those looking closely enough.DOOM Eternal is one of the year’s best games, and a watershed moment for first person shooters, but I have to say that grudgingly. It tinkers with the perfection of its predecessor too much, in some ways that make sense, but in a lot of others that stymie its creative combat chess and thus force the player to adopt some fairly restrictive gameplay styles…unless of course they are insanely good or downright obstinate. George Lucas once famously (and ironically) said that a work of art is never finished, just torn kicking and screaming from its creator’s hands. I think that applies here; the team at id stared at this thing for four years, tweaking and fiddling, probably getting bored looking at the same maps and encounters over and over again, and probably making the game more difficult and more restrictive to alleviate their boredom.I don’t want to presume too much, but I think the id team polished DOOM Eternal—just a little too much—into an experience that satisfied their exacting ideas of fun demon slaying, rather than letting players build their own murder style. The result is immensely challenging, peerlessly optimized, mechanically robust and a feast for the eyes and ears…but not quite as satisfying as the DOOMs and Quakes that came before.DOOM Eternal is gorgeous to behold, a technological tour-de-force and an exciting new chapter in the Doom narrative, but it's not quite as fun to play as DOOM 2016. The problem is not that DOOM Eternal is too hard, rather it is too hard unless you play by its specific rules, which, for all its mechanical complexity, makes its combat chess less freeform and satisfying than its predecessors.* The product in this article was sent to us by the developer/company.I've been gaming off and on since I was about three, starting with Star Raiders on the Atari 800 computer.

DOOM Eternal,Chris Wray,Wccftech,https://wccftech.com/review/doom-eternal-review/,"ID Software and Bethesda surprised everybody in 2016 when they released Doom. Not only did the multiplayer beta release to a resounding sigh, but Bethesda also started a policy in which reviewers wouldn't get a copy of the game until release, creating a lot of doubt. Fortunately, Doom was fantastic and the policy didn't last long. Following the excellent reception of Doom, expectations have obviously been heightened and the anticipation for yet another true old-school shooter is at boiling point. Can Doom Eternal and the Doom Slayer satiate this desire for demonic blood? Let's find out.Note: This was a review in progress. Review now complete as of 24th March.Let's answer the question right away. YES. Doom Eternal can and will satiate any Doom-like desires you may have. Much like the Doom rebirth in 2016, this is a fast-paced, action-heavy shooter that has that incredibly addictive quality of being relentlessly in your face. If you're playing Doom, you're slaughtering hordes of demons using a wide range of devastatingly entertaining weapons. Even better is that the demons that are terrorising the world are petrified of you.Much like the earlier entry, the Doom Slayer is as talkative as he ever was. Unlike the earlier entry, he doesn't seem as impatient as he was before. Now and then you will have moments where somebody starts yammering off a long monologue, only to be pulverised by the slayer. However, there are times where the game seems intent on throwing a list of names, events and whatever else your way. There's something about a Khan who makes things. Honestly, the story interests me so little that I felt like the skip button should at least result in the cinematic murder of a demon, just to keep in with the nature of Doom Eternal. Sadly, it didn't the one time I tried it.The part of the story I like is how the game represents just how the demonic horde feels about the Doom Slayer. As soon as he enters a room, the infighting suddenly stops and all they can see is him. It's elements like this that truly adds to the world. Rather than have the enemies just stood around waiting for him, you get to see elements of strife between the demons. Naturally, Darwinism should be at its height in such a competitive society. The fact that you are the ultimate boogeyman, the strongest of them all, is brilliantly displayed by something so simple.If you want to delve into the world and the lore, the game doesn't leave you hanging. There are the aforementioned long monologues. In addition to these, there are a wide number of codex entries to find through simply playing the game and killing enemies, to hunting around for secrets - some of which can include random codex entries. These offer a great deal of inside into the world of Doom Eternal and, frankly, are more interesting than the cinematic story parts. Maybe it's just me, but the series has taught me to not care about the story in Doom.This move towards actually force-feeding some elements of the story doesn't take away from the true draw of Doom Eternal though - the pure, visceral, violence. The game has ample of this to keep you entertained, creating that superb balance between offloading an armies worth of ammunition into a demonic horde, before running around like a headless chicken attempting to rearm, re-armour and heal up before getting back into the thick of things. Much like the previous outing, it offers a fantastic game of tug of war where you're often just getting by on the brink of death.Of course, if you played the previous Doom, then Doom Eternal will also feature elements that you're well aware of. When you kill an enemy, they'll drop some health pickups to keep you going in the fight. If you take them down using your chainsaw, usually your method of last resort, you'll get a fair few ammo pickups. There are also combinations of attacks that can give you armour drops and more. It all works exceptionally well to keep the fast-paced combat flowing, at least if you're good at the combat loop. I'm not the best, to be quite frank.This doesn't stop me from loving almost every second of the combat. Almost being the key word in that sentence. Doom Eternal can be pretty overwhelming at times, with almost too many weapons with multiple secondary attacks to use and work through. This is especially true when you also take into account the fact that these weapons have multiple customisation options and each of these has a challenge to complete, letting you achieve mastery of the weapon.Even though there are a lot of weapons with their multiple secondary attacks, I have to give props to Id Software for the placement of everything. It all ramps up perfectly, where you never feel too overpowered and, at the same time, you never feel like you're in over your head. You are the Doom Slayer, so you should be able to demolish the demonic horde, but it also should be a reasonable challenge.As much as Doom has always been about collecting new things, secrets and so forth, there's a case to be made that Doom Eternal has taken it a little too far. Each level has dozens of collectibles to find, from extra lives and dolls to records, sentinel crystals and more. Every mission is massive in its own right, but the issue then is that they feel a little too familiar, for lack of better word. There's no real surprise. You go from arena battle to arena battle, just going through corridors and platforming sections in between, now and then just looking for a little space to find the aforementioned secrets.The campaign will take you a fair amount of time to complete. For me it was over the twenty-hour mark, though that's also because I love to explore every nook and cranny, picking up everything I can. There are a few frustrations to be found within the environmental puzzles, having to time almost too perfectly jumps onto monkey bars and dashes to clear large gaps. While I appreciate a little variety in a game and Doom Eternal does add a lot of verticality, it adds a little too much - linking into the earlier issue of maps being too similar in function, moving from arena to corridor and then repeating.Even if the function is too similar at times, it never fails to be entertaining and appealing aesthetically. Maps are gruesome, gory and chock full of details. The same applies to the demons, all of them looking and feeling unique when fighting them. Musically, Doom Eternal also works perfectly, the heavy metal ramping up during a battle, adding to the fast and frantic nature of the game. It's rare that everything works so perfectly together, but it does here, even better is that I've not encountered a single glitch or bug, with the game performing perfectly.Let's talk multiplayer. With all the talks of the multiplayer being a core component, with Doom Eternal being primarily an online experience, I expected more. The multiplayer, Battlemode, pits two demons against the slayer. This asymmetrical mode certainly has the Doom Eternal action you're used to. It even has some decent tactical options there, particularly when you take on the mantle of the mortally challenged. The issue is that it just feels lacking to me and there's only so much enjoyment I can get out of just one game mode.That's the real issue with the multiplayer is that it's lacking the ""eons old"" deathmatch mode, the mode that people loved and still love from the franchise and multiplayer games in general. While Battlemode is fun, it is entertaining, it's just one mode. The other aspect about the game is primarily an online experience is the fact that both the multiplayer and single-player modes both tie into a levelling system as well as a number of challenges, such as killing a number of particular demons with particular weapons, which will rotate weekly.PC version of the game reviewed. Copy provided by the publisher.Doom Eternal is a brilliant game, one that is a worthy successor to the previous release. While the game does stumble here and there, trying to be something that it really shouldn't be, the outstanding gameplay more than makes up for any issues. Going by the campaign alone, Doom Eternal is well worth your time and money, particularly so if you liked Doom. I'm not sold on the multiplayer, as it feels just a bit too threadbare.The links above are affiliate links.

DOOM Eternal,Paul Sullivan,COGconnected,https://cogconnected.com/review/doom-eternal-review/,"Doom Eternal is metal as f***. The whole franchise has been, of course, but Doom Eternal cranks the dial to 11, throws gas on the fire, puts the pedal to the metal. Pick any cliche idiom you want: Doom Eternal holds its slayer horns high and proud, refining just about everything Doom 2016 did well. It’s tense, frantic, and absolutely transcendent.It’s been that way from the beginning. Doom was first person nirvana in 1993, using early 3D acceleration technology to build labyrinthine worlds gamers absolutely loved. It holds up today, as do its sequels. Id Software’s dedication to pushing tech forward continued with Doom 3, RAGE, and culminated with Doom – COGconnected’s Game of the Year in 2016.The guns, the gore, the mobility, and Mick Gordon’s relentless soundtrack fueled that title, and I’m here to tell you that it’s nothing compared to what id has achieved with Doom Eternal.*Spoilers for Doom 2016. However, spoilers will be at a minimum for Doom Eternal in this article.*With the Doom Slayer’s work on Mars complete, Doom 2016 concluded with Dr. Hayden teleporting him to an undisclosed location. In Doom Eternal the fight continues on Earth, and it’s up to the Doom Slayer to repel the forces of darkness from the realm of humanity. The tone of the events here is more self-serious than the last game, but it retains just enough of the ridiculous tone (shoutout to the UAC propaganda hologram). The narrative is deeper than I expected, but it’s optional in a lot of ways. The bare-bones are presented in the game itself, with the deeper lore getting hidden in the codex. The content there is quite good, but I wish the game did more to encourage engagement with it. Still, reading through a couple codex notes is a viable way to bring your heart back from the verge of v.fib.Part of what gets the ol’ ticker going is Doom’s design work. Hellified Earth is gorgeous in the most disgusting way. Everything corrupted by hell feels alive and yet dying, with excellent industrial design applied to all the Earth technology. The demon designs are nothing new but have been brilliantly built to 2020 standards. Pinkies and Cacodemons are my personal favorites, but the fact I learned to pucker my sphincters just from seeing a demon approach says a lot about Doom’s permanently awesome monster design.It’s gory as hell too. But not in an I-wanna-puke way. Laying waste to the legions of hell is so grin inducing that you might start thumbing the yellow pages for a reasonably priced brain scan. When you’ve just chainsawed a pink meat-blob in half and then impaled its pal’s eyeball on a spike with a Joker-size grin on your face, you start to question things. Maybe I AM disturbed. Oh well.Technically, things run beautifully on the PS4 Pro. It’s basically locked at 60 fps during the important parts, with a hitch or two once in a while. On the PC side, the requirements are mighty stiff but it runs just as well as the other idTech games do. The hellfire looks particularly devilish, and I think that sticks out because it’s one of the things you’ll routinely be looking at during down moments. When hell hits the fan, you can’t see anything. There’s so much blood. You read the situation and react. It’s pure survival.Doom Eternal is intense. SO intense. Everything in the game is balanced on a shotgun’s edge, meaning it’s unbelievably thrilling, and also you’re constantly at risk of being dragged down to hell. Id has done a fantastic job keeping the roulette wheel spinning in Doom Eternal. There’s never a sense of familiarity for more than a few seconds, and you’re constantly being forced to improvise and change tactics. There are a few components contributing to that, so let’s address the one most people won’t notice first: the level design.Besides being different thematically, the shapes, sizes, verticality, and contents of combat areas in Eternal are never rote. Sure, boost pads, monkey bars, and double jumps are common, but the spacing and layout here is constantly extremely conducive to experimentation. I ran into a few invisible walls here and there, but it really took some bizarre QA tester experimentation to get to those spots. In most cases, yes, that platform is within reach, you can boost off those monkey bars and dash twice to grab that 1UP, and yes, you can land on that Arachnotron and blood punch its stupid brain. It’s surreal, and makes you feel powerful even when failure is constantly nipping at your heels.What I didn’t expect to like so much is exploration. It’s really, really fun. Levels are more or less linear, but finding little side paths and backtracking to find skills points you missed switched on my inner completionist without feeling like a weekend to-do list. It feels so good because the movement in Doom Eternal is the new high watermark. It’s sublime.Like everything in Doom, movement happens at hyper speed. The Doom Slayer hauls ass. Dashes recharge quickly, aiming is twitchy and precise without feeling overboosted. Perfectly placed rockets while sailing overhead feel second nature. Squeezing off the exact number of plasma bullets to activate a glory kill opportunity is trivial, and I’m not the world’s best FPS player. Honestly, I can’t believe that playing an FPS with a controller feels this good.The guns feel outstanding too. Precision heavy cannon bolts can take out the Arachnotron’s turret, while a grenade in a Cacodemon’s mouth staggers it. I have my favorites of course (meat hook into Super Shotgun blast obvs), but literally every weapon, every mod, every upgrade has a perfect time and place to be used. The weapon mod system plays a big role, and although it’s more of a checklist I found an immense amount of satisfaction and sense of discovery every time I unlocked something. I thought back to prior encounters, damn near salivating at the thought of taking another crack at a tough slayer gate.Perhaps the most miraculous balance in Doom Eternal is the way combat flows. Actions feed perfectly into one another, and it never. gets. old. Much of it is like Doom, but it’s been refined like a fine, hellish wine in Eternal. Staggering foes still allows for health restoring Glory Kills, while the chainsaw uses fuel but causes huge ammo drops. Meanwhile, setting enemies on fire causes armor pickups to spill out of them. One or more of those things is always necessary, and weaving those actions together in an endless string of destruction is magnificent. Get it wrong and you’ll most certainly die, and with the adrenaline really pumping I repeatedly came close to becoming the Doom Slayer and snapping whatever happened to be within reach. Sanity prevailed though, and the forces of good lived on to build muscle memory and master the dance.The sound design is sharp, loud, and uncompromising. Mick Gordon’s soundtrack absolutely rips, like a buzzsaw inside your brain whipping you onward. It’s not that it’s particularly unique, but it suits the mood of the environment and the mission of the Doom Slayer perfectly. Bullets and explosions crack and snap, while demonic voiceovers are both stereotypical and likely to inspire you to send the beast back where he belongs.I’ve come to the part where I tell you about all the things going on in Doom Eternal that aren’t the campaign and/or shooting demons. There’s a lot. The Doom Slayer can upgrade his suit (though I found most of the upgrades underwhelming) through found Praetor coins, use weapon points earned in battle to upgrade guns, use sentinel shards to upgrade health, ammo, and armor while earning useful perks, equip runes that enhance his killing, find and display collectible toy versions of demons, and use sentinel batteries to unlock stuff in the Fortress of Doom. Oh, and there are cheat codes. Yeah. Strangely, it doesn’t feel unapproachable or at all like there’s too many things going on. Maybe that’s because the most complicated menu in the world would feel mundane compared to the hair-on-fire insanity of the game, but hey, I’ll take that all day long.Doom Eternal is a phenomenal game. It’s incredibly intense, like id Software did a massive burnout on the faces of other shooters. The movement and shooting is perfection, and the balance is immaculate and restrained despite being the video game equivalent of standing too close to a rocket launch. If you’ve got any fondness for shooters, the 90’s, or fun generally, consider Doom Eternal absolutely essential.*Review codes provided by the Publisher**Doom Eternal’s multiplayer – Battlemode – looks really interesting, but will only be online once the game launches to the public. As such, this review and score ignores its existence, but I’m massively interested in seeing what it’s like. Stay tuned here for updates and impressions.*Developer: id SoftwarePublisher: Bethesda Softworks"
DOOM Eternal,John-Paul Jones,PlayStation Universe,https://www.psu.com/reviews/doom-eternal-ps4-review/," John-Paul Jones / March 20, 2020Look, DOOM Eternal is ridiculously incredible. In fact, it seems almost downright rude that with its latest shooter sequel, id Software has so thoroughly bettered the genre’s previous golden standard in 2016’s DOOM – yet here we are. Much more than just a beefier version of what we had previously (although that would have been welcome also), DOOM Eternal meaningfully evolves its deceptively delicate, clockwork formula in ways that while not especially surprising, all nonetheless conspire to create the sum of the greatest first-person shooter of this generation. Simply put, DOOM Eternal is every bit as good as you thought it would be.It’s reassuring then that the central design DNA of DOOM Eternal remains ultimately unchanged from its predecessor. You will again at high speed, sprint-strafe through a variety of gore steeped levels, laying waste to an increasingly grotesque range of demonic aggressors with the sort of high caliber super satisfying firepower that makes you grin subconsciously like an S rank psycho, all the while the energising thrum of Mick Gordon’s heavy metal soundtrack rattles your earlobes in line with the on-screen slaughter.Make no mistake then, while this is absolutely DOOM, it is also very much DOOM 2.0 in all but name too. For a start, DOOM Eternal massively expands its roster of monsters, both reaching back into its storied heritage while also conjuring up all-new horrors to fill out the ranks. While the traditional DOOM vanguard of the various grunts, Imps, Cacodemons, Lost Souls and more all make a grand return, they find themselves in equally grim company as the Pain Elemental, Archvile, Arachnotron, and Hellified Soldiers from DOOM II all step up to try and smash the Doom Slayer into a fine red mist. As one might expect though, it’s some of the newest demons that pose the greatest threat to the player.Related Content – Best PS4 FPS Games – Shooters That ExcelThe new Carcass demon for example, which looks like a deeply angry bald man with horrific injuries that have been sown up by a blind man while also boasting a funky mechanical tripod where his legs should be, has a special shield that when triggered, makes him impervious to any damage from your rocket launcher – quite literally rendering one of DOOM Eternal’s most essential go-to armaments essentially useless. The kicker? He can manifest that shield at range, so sometimes if you try and put a rocket in his direction, the shield can appear in front of your face causing you to rocket yourself into gooey chunks. Fun!Intertwining with the new roster of demonic bad dudes is DOOM Eternal’s new ‘Destructible Demons’ system where as you damage your evil foes more and more, the toil of your hellacious attack becomes apparent on their physical form, as all manner of gashes, torn limbs, flayed flesh and bloody, dangling appendages create quite the gory spectacle. In particular, destroying a Mancubus in this way produces quite the macabre result, as a shredded, blood-gushing spinal cord flaps in the wind whilst sat atop a pair of decimated, stumpy legs. Nice.Related Content – DOOM 64 PS4 ReviewMore than just a cosmetic change, there is also a meaningful and functional flip side to this system now too, as each demon has a weak point that when struck, can greatly reduce their attack power. Take the nightmarish Arachnotron for example – should you destroy the creature’s tail cannon, you can cut off its super deadly turbo laser attack, making the monster a much easier kill as a result.Equally as much as DOOM Eternal thankfully doubles down on the ear-ringing, smashmouth beats of its predecessor, so too is there’s a newfound focus on moment to moment tactical thinking too. Though the emphasis remains on ‘ambush’ style encounters where rooms effectively walls off and become a murder playground for you and the demons until you win (or die), every ambush and demonic battle encounter is essentially a reflex-based puzzler that plays out at breakneck pace.At the centre of this new cerebral approach to combat is an all-new harvesting system that depending on how you kill enemies, will provide you with different supplies in return. The best example of this is the manner in which the iconic chainsaw has been overhauled for DOOM Eternal.Murdering enemies with the chainsaw now allows you to refill your ammo for the rest of your weapons, however the Chainsaw runs on fuel and so you must be careful how generously you go around sawing your way through Hell’s legions. There is nuance and cleverness baked into this mechanic too, as even if you exhaust the chainsaw it will regenerate albeit slowly – demanding frugal application rather than greedy use as a result.Additionally, Glory Kills of course still feature and are as much a satisfying showcase of splatter and flamboyant murder as they are a functional mechanism, with each successful Glory Kill providing precious health. Elsewhere, setting your foes alight with the flamethrower will allow you to replenish your armor and it’s only by deftly balancing all three to keep your armor, ammo and health topped up that you’ll make it through in one piece.Related Content – March 2020 PS4, PSVR, PS Vita, DLC, Video Game Release DatesIf the suitably gore splattered executions that the Glory Kills trigger weren’t enough to entice you, the new Blood Punch mechanic also provides a great reason to keep on using them. The more Glory Kills you pull off, the higher the meter gets and when fully charged, it allows players to unleash the Blood Punch – a massive seismic left hook that absolutely obliterates anything in front of it. Think of DOOM’s traditional Berserk mode with horrific AoE damage, extra sparkles and you’re basically there.It’s at this point, when you’re in full command of DOOM Eternal’s suite of nuanced mechanics to keep yourself alive that you feel more empowered than ever. No fight ever feels completely hopeless because if you find yourself low on health, ammo or armor, there’s always a way to claw it back and stay in the fight and because of this, DOOM Eternal feels much more satisfying than just about any other shooter on the market today.And all this is without making mention of DOOM Eternal’s absolute mountain of interlocked upgrade systems too. Inclusive of the kind of the transformative weapon mods we saw in 2016’s DOOM, through to perks that let you perform Glory Kills from further distances and smaller buffs that improve environment traversal and other mechanics, the scope for progression in DOOM Eternal is simply incredible.Related Content – DOOM Eternal Director Already Has Ideas For The Next GameWhere DOOM Eternal possesses extra sophistication and a deepening of its systems, it always feels perfectly judged and never bloated or unnecessary, doing a great job of incentivising the player to push on and achieve more rather than creaking under the weight of its new systems. Certainly, id Software have managed the improbable in this regard – negotiating a perilous balancing act of providing extra depth without negatively affecting the simplistic purity of the DOOM formula.A big part of the reason why DOOM Eternal’s progression systems are so compelling, is because each of them is tied directly into all the content that the game provides. From secret, hard to reach areas stuffed with secrets, to special encounters that reward weapon upgrades and a fast travel mechanic that lets you revisit areas you’ve missed, DOOM Eternal is absolutely a completist’s dream.Speaking of completion, DOOM Eternal is absolutely rammed to the hilt with secrets and more easter eggs than a seasonal Walmart, with collectible action figures, soundtracks of id Software games (including Quake!), cheat code discs and much more besides that can be sought out and collected. Of course, it’s nice having all these doodads, but what’s better is having somewhere swanky to store them all in.That’s right – for the first time ever in a DOOM game, we now have a hub area/man cave where the Doom Slayer keeps all of his collectible stuff (including a wonderfully old-fashioned MS DOS PC and a range of hell guitars). Looking like something out of Warhammer 40K, the aptly titled Fortress of Doom is more than just a showcase of treasures collected, as Sentinel Batteries which can be collected during missions can be used to unlock parts of the fortress, providing handy upgrades and loot in return.Related Content – Upcoming PS4 Games: PlayStation 4 Titles In 2020 You Won’t Want To MissBeyond its much enlarged and more impressive content offering, DOOM Eternal is a great deal more ambitious than its 2016 predecessor in every other way too. The aesthetic is given imaginative license especially, as DOOM Eternal’s depiction of Hell on Earth is one that liberally pulls from biblical and heavy metal archetypes with equal aplomb. The cages of rotting, twitching barely alive masses of meat and flesh writhe behind rusty bars while the Hellscape itself seemingly stretches into infinity as jagged, obsidian peaks and massive tentacled growths soar upwards, piercing swirling crimson skies with violent vigor all linger long in the mind.When it comes to the narrative side of things the story of DOOM Eternal is as expected, refreshingly straightforward. The premise is thus – the mute Doom Slayer must track down and kill the three Hell Priests in charge of commanding the demonic invasion of Earth. Happily then, I can report that much like the gameplay beats to which the story is wedded, so too is DOOM Eternal’s narrative equally subversive and intriguingly nuanced at times – inviting other cultural mythological influences from outside its previously defined biblical sphere of storytelling to flesh things out – you can expect plenty of surprises too.Arguably though, the biggest change that DOOM Eternal makes over its 2016 predecessor is that there is more platforming in the game. Much more. This will likely prove divisive for some folks who would want DOOM Eternal to be nothing but a room-to-room shooter (which is fine), but in actuality, the increased prominence of platforming dovetails directly into the hyper-agility that the game affords to the player.Certainly then, DOOM Eternal’s traversal is impressively enabled. Ensconced in its double jumping, air-dashing, climbing and pole jumping moves, DOOM Eternal is one of the most agile shooters ever made. You’ll need every bit of that newfound flexibility too as DOOM Eternal’s levels are riddled with platforming challenges such as rotating columns of flame, crumbling platforms and more that wouldn’t look out of place in a full-fat 3D platformer.Again, your mileage on this may vary, but personally, I feel that DOOM Eternal’s newfound emphasis on platforming is a great match for its shooter fundamentals and is a perfectly well-executed and natural evolution from what we saw back in 2016.Another area where DOOM Eternal is leagues ahead of its illustrious predecessor is in the size of the levels – DOOM Eternal is frickin’ huge. With each level taking between two and three hours to complete, DOOM Eternal sadly no longer enables folks to hop on and quickly burn through a level – though a generous checkpointing system does help to keep DOOM Eternal’s substantial duration nice and digestible.Elsewhere, there is a much, much wider range of level designs now too. With environments ranging from vast, mossy medieval, stained-glass fortresses to bases locked in a snow swept tundra, post apocalyptic cities and… other places that I won’t reveal for sake of spoilers, each and every map in DOOM Eternal is a joy to explore and murder bad dudes in.In retrospect, the multiplayer component of DOOM 2016 was always going to struggle with separating itself from its much more tenured and popular peers. So DOOM Eternal’s shift from a regular deathmatch mode to its new Battlemode is a welcome change indeed.The basic premise for Battlemode is thus – you have two teams, with one team belonging to the Doom Slayer and the other team belonging to the demons, with two players taking up the reins of the demonic legion. Before each round begins, Team Demon can pick from a wide range of demonic dudes (with more arriving post launch) and each of them boasts their own unique powers, as well as the ability to summon smaller demon pawns mid-battle to do their dirty work for them.The Doom Slayer on the other hand, is a super-powerful figure, as he boasts all of the unlocked weapons and mods from the main campaign, while at the end of each round, both sides unlock new abilities and perks that allow them to gain an advantage over the opposite team. Crucially, this mode, even at this relatively early juncture, feels well-balanced.Though the Doom Slayer is super powerful and can massacre the opposing demons quickly, Team Demon can only lose if both members of its team are killed within a few seconds of each other. Additionally, Team Demon can also make life hell (pun intended) for the Doom Slayer by blocking him retrieving much needed health and ammo supplies, all the while bringing down a small legion of lesser demons upon him.With fast and furious adversarial gameplay being a staple of this mode, which in turn is enabled a range of fiendishly designed maps, each with their own traps, nooks and crannies to take advantage of, Battlemode ably acquits itself as nice distraction from the main story campaign and a worthy change from the usual deathmatch fare seen elsewhere.In terms of progression, Event XP is earned both in Battlemode and in the main campaign, but rather than being used to directly affect the game balance in competitive multiplayer, DOOM Eternal takes a leaf out of Overwatch’s book and simply uses XP as a form of currency to buy cosmetic upgrades and that’s it. You can’t moneyhat your way to success here.Technically, DOOM Eternal is splendorous. Running at 60 frames per second at upscaled to 4K on PS4 Pro, DOOM Eternal is the best that the formidable id Tech 7 engine has ever looked, with a blistering, uncompromising framerate, massive worlds, insane levels of texture detail and more particle, lighting and shadow effects than you can shake a frag grenade at.Complimenting the extremely high quality visual presentation is the music, which quite simply soars. The ear-rattling thunder of Mick Gordon’s expertly composed heavy metal soundtrack is not just absolutely fantastic to listen to but is intelligently implemented too, ramping up to a white-kunckle, head-banging crescendo when an enemy ambush springs upon you or if a massive new foe enters the fray. If you like to drop heavy, this is one soundtrack you’ll want to have in collection that much is for sure.DOOM Eternal shows the godfather of the genre, id Software, at the height of its breathtaking creative powers. DOOM Eternal also reinforces, at the point of a blazing demon destroying buckshot, that the DOOM Slayer is one of most satisfying protagonists the industry has ever created. DOOM Eternal is one of the most essential titles of this entire generation. You know what you have to do.DOOM Eternal releases on PS4, Xbox One, PC, Stadia and Nintendo Switch on March 20, 2020.Review code kindly provided by publisher.A triumphant celebration of blood, sweat and fury, DOOM Eternal is a genre and generation defining FPS that through some occult ritual, somehow manages to comprehensively blow its 2016 GOTY contending predecessor completely out of the water with remarkable ease. With a stunning story campaign and innovative Battlemode multiplayer offering, this one is for the Slayers.
