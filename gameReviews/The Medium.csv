The Medium,Vikki Blake,Eurogamer,https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-01-27-the-medium-review,"A game of two halves.Death is everywhere here. You can feel it. You can smell it. I know that makes no sense - how can you tell that from a video game? - and yet you know that's what it smells like, a muddy, earthy, cloying scent that sticks in your throat as you tiptoe across the razor-thin edge between Here and There. Light and shadow. Life and death. Fungus blooms everywhere and doorways quiver, blanketed with a thick, terrible, alien skin. Later, arms will hang down from the ceilings and shattered bones will jut out of the ground. Later still, the entire world will be soaked in a blood-red filter as you scramble up mountains of paperwork and giant, haphazard filing cabinets. Even the 'real' world is scattered with reminders of what used to be. A hotel is frozen in time, the scattered belongings of its guests - suitcases and odd shoes and forgotten toys - sprinkled throughout the ruins. It's the kind of place that someone coined the word ""hubbub"" for, a room that's supposed to ripple with laughter and footsteps and the endless ting of the bell on reception. For you, though, it's empty. Cold. Dead. Death is all Marianne has ever known. It begins with The Medium's opening line - ""It all starts with a dead girl"" - and doesn't waver right up until the credits roll. Even in this reality - her safe place, supposedly - she's an undertaker, and that's where we find her as her story begins, preparing to bury the only man that ever showed her any kindness.  The duality of The Medium isn't subtle. It draws heavily on the ying-yang of contrast - good and bad; up and down; happiness and sadness - and recycles it endlessly, thematically and literally. There's no attempt to conceal Bloober's unabashed affection of old school horror, either. There have been flickers of it throughout the studio's horror-heavy back catalogue, but no game has come quite as close to The Medium in terms of unadulterated adoration. That said, there's a reason why some of those old horror tropes have been left in the past. The fixed camera angles undoubtedly enable the developer to spin a more sophisticated visual narrative, as well as heighten tension and uneasiness, but I am forever impaling Marianne on environmental hazards I simply can't see. The tank controls, too, are better in theory than practice. You no doubt already know that Troy Baker lends his talents to terrifying antagonist The Maw, and yes, he's predictably wonderful as it - the creature's guttural mutterings and furtive soliloquies hint at something vaguely human, or at least attempting to appear so - but otherwise, the voice performances are a little uneven. I can't say I particularly warmed to Marianne, either; though fearless, her character was a tad too one-note for me. It was the story that kept me gripped, and while that too perhaps lacked the depth I'd been hoping for, it's nonetheless an intriguing yarn that - like its title - was neither too long nor too short, but... well, medium length, at around eight-ish hours.But oh my lord, is it beautiful here. I know it's weird to say that - this netherworld is a burnt, broken place; it's not somewhere you'd choose to holiday - but there's an undeniable beauty here, too, secreted between the alien flora, fungi and fear. Juxtaposed just-so between the piles of skulls and frozen death masks, Bloober's canny use of fixed vignettes means every shot is perfectly dreadful and dreadfully perfect, and only further enhanced by the soundscapes sculpted by composer Arkadiusz Reikowski and Silent Hill sound director and producer, Akira Yamaoka. The inspiration drawn from celebrated Polish artist Zdzisław Beksiński (whose work I've now fallen wholly and inextricably in love with) is all over it, yes, but to Bloober's credit, the world it's painted is so much more than mere homage. As I progressed through Marianne's story, the set-pieces reminded me of several games that have come before it - Alice: Madness Returns, Control, Silent Hill, and even Portal 2, to name but a few - and given every single one of them is celebrated for its striking visual vocabulary, that can't be a bad thing. And if there was a photo mode I'd have endlessly abused it. I suspect that's weird to say, too, but it's true. While it starts out muted - at first, Marianne's alternate reality is painted with mud and rust - the further you progress, the more vibrant it'll become, as though each time she returns to the real world, she leaves a fragment of herself behind to soften its palette and fill it with pale blues, mossy greens, and ruby reds. The Medium isn't quite as scary as prior Bloober offerings, though. Beyond one early, unexpected surprise (I still have bruised knees from where my legs collided with the underside of my desk), it's a sedate affair, choosing to let its environments unsettle you rather than jumpscares. While I admit I missed some of Layer of Fears' creative shocks, I can't say this is to the game's detriment, and may even win over new horror fans who crave atmosphere over scripted scares.Moving through two realities simultaneously is every bit as disorientating as it sounds initially, but Bloober overcomes this with clever engineering that goes beyond merely projecting two versions of the same scene. More often than not, splitscreen cut-scenes portray slightly different perspectives, and what you'll see in one isn't always apparent in the other. This means you'll find your gaze flicking from one side of the screen to the other - some splits are horizontal; others are vertical - in search of the irregularities, like a macabre spot-the-difference puzzle.Talking of puzzles; cerebral they are not. I've been stuck on Bloober puzzles for hours in the past - Blair Witch stumped me good and proper several times - but The Medium's offerings are less opaque, and only a couple outstay their welcome. Marianne has just three tricks up her psychic sleeve; Insight - the power to see beyond the veil and spy secrets an ordinary gaze will miss; Spirit Blast, which enables her to shoot out a powerful shock of energy to overload electrics or shake off enemies; and the ability to have an Out of Body Experience.Yeah. I know. It sounds strange, and it is a bit. The former's pretty cool, enabling her to get auditory visions of the past from everyday items, as well as construct Echoes, ghostly memories of the past that help Marianne piece together what once happened here. Spirit Blast, while ostentatious, is underutilised. Out of Body Experience, on the other hand, enables her to divorce her spirit from her physical form to access something - usually a lock - in the spirit realm. She can also absorb and channel psychic energy by locating Spirit Wells - a font of psychic power, I guess you'd call it - that can also be used to ward off denizens as well as open doors. Your Out of Body Experience is always time-limited, though, as her spiritual side will slowly dissipate until you return her to her physical body. Dawdle too long, and she'll die. It's perhaps no surprise, then, that given its so heavily constrained by the careful camera angles and tourniquet-tight storytelling, the gameplay is so rigid it might as well be on rails. Sadly, this results in an astonishing lack of organic exploration. Maybe it's greedy to want more, but I do wish I could've spent more time scurrying around that topsy-turvy place, peeking into every creepy cranny and unmasking every secret. Beyond this sedate puzzling, Marianne will find herself either skulking about or fleeing for her life. Again, the team has seemingly learned from mistakes such as Layer of Fear 2's tedious scripted death sequences, and while there's no doubt that making her run full-pelt towards the camera is both terrifying and a nod to horror games of yore, it gets old quickly. One breathlessly brilliant exception, however, sends you continuously catapulting between worlds as you run for your life, trying to avoid the hazards as you go. Yes, Marianne's world is one of duality - good and evil; heaven and hell; life and death - there is little negative to weigh down Bloober Team's lofty ambition. Even though it substitutes scripted scares for an unsettling atmosphere instead - something I fear not all fans will be happy with - The Medium is the studio's most successful, accessible offering yet, and a sign that Bloober continues to improve, mature, and innovate. I cannot wait for its next terrifying adventure. You're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!

Link: Official site (opens in new tab)We're all going to die some day, so I won't waste your time: The Medium is one of the best third-person horror games I've ever played. Bloober Team, the studio behind Blair Witch and the Layers of Fear series, has completely outdone those less ambitious games with the fantastically written, emotionally grounded story of Marianne, a young woman who can see and communicate with spirits. What it lacks in technical polish it makes up for with chilling set pieces and thoughtful plot developments.

The Medium plays like an old school Resident Evil game, minus the guns. You navigate Marianne around crumbling, abandoned hotels and claustrophobic Cold War bunkers from fixed camera angles, which can be cumbersome, but it's an effective design choice. Like the games that inspired it, The Medium is excellent at making you feel like you're always being watched, and that danger could be lurking just out of view at any time.What you do is fairly simple: Most sections involve finding hidden objects, solving puzzles, or sneaking past ghastly enemies against whom you are mostly powerless. The added gimmick is that Marianne can sometimes see into the spirit world, which is handled by splitting your screen in half. All inputs affect the real and spirit world versions of Marianne identically, but things are complicated by small differences in the terrain or enemies that only exist in one world. Bloober definitely didn't push this idea to its limits. Most of the puzzles are fairly simple, and there were only a couple of those Portal-like ""A-ha!"" moments that made me feel like I'd done something really clever. But the lack of roadblocks keeps the pacing fairly brisk, which works well with the kind of story that's being told.That story is undoubtedly the star. The Medium is exquisitely paced and plotted, with multidimensional characters and a complex, but not convoluted, supernatural mystery to uncover. I had several running theories about what was going on at the haunted Niwa Resort that all made sense, but the true answer ended up being even more elegant and poignant than I guessed—and yet the solution didn't come out of left field, M. Night Shyamalan style. Over its course, The Medium asks what makes a person evil, and what the difference is between the innately sadistic and those who are turned into monsters by cycles of violence—though it doesn't apologize for anyone. In untangling these themes it explores domestic abuse and even genocide, but these concepts aren't displayed gratuitously for mere shock value. It's some of the sharpest writing I've seen in a videogame in quite a long time.This is all supported by a spectacular voice cast. From the intrepid but troubled Marianne to the enigmatic avenger Thomas to a deeply unnerving archvillain brought to life by Troy Baker, every character is realized with exceptional emotional depth and authenticity. The central struggle Thomas faces, in particular, is a heartbreaking story of a man in an impossible situation, and all of its highs and lows hit me right in the heart. It's easy to find common ground with characters who are trying to do the right thing in a world with no right answers.Composers Arkadiusz Reikowski and Akira Yamaoka (Silent Hill franchise) back the exploration with a haunting, melancholy score, and then bring intense, disturbing tracks when we're fleeing for our life—it's music you'll notice and appreciate. And every rundown hallway and spooky Polish forest feels alive thanks to some of the best positional audio and layered ambience I've heard in a game: Lifelike echoes bounce off of a concrete tunnel, and the ramblings of a creature hunting you pace back and forth between the left and right audio channels.It looks pretty stunning, too, with overgrown, post-Soviet ruins in the real world and a macabre, yellow-tinged spirit world as its surreal mirror. The textures, color balance, and lighting evoke a range of moods: intrigue, unease, and unadulterated horror.Niwa Resort is layered with small details from roof to paving stones, including crinkled old Polish magazines accurate to the 1990s era. When Marianne is split between worlds, walls of human flesh and spectral moths are juxtaposed with the mundanity of an abandoned classroom on the other side of the screen. It gives the sense that you're never really safe—when the split screen effect goes away and you're just looking at the classroom, how do you know what's going on over on the other side? The character models are the one area where detail is lacking, especially in contrast to how fantastic everything else looks. They stand out with a somewhat doll-like appearance, and stiff animations. They won't always connect with the objects they're interacting with.There are performance issues, too. While I was generally able to maintain a good 45-60 fps on my RTX 2060 Super, there is a significant amount of hitching when you first enter the spirit world or transition between gameplay and a cutscene. This took the bite out of some key moments, like a monster jumping out at you for the first time. The RTX effects can look stunning, but they dropped me down closer to a 30-35 fps baseline with some dips into the mid-20s. The ""RTX On"" setting disables certain effects dynamically when performance dips too low, which is kind of nice, but can lead to weirdness like water flickering between RTX and non-RTX shading in a jarring way. The ""Force On"" option will prevent this, but it made certain areas with complex point lighting, particularly in the spirit world, an unplayable slideshow. So neither setting is completely ideal.On another PC with an RTX 2070 Super, we managed framerates in the 40s to 60s at 1440p with RTX On and DLSS set to high quality, but also ran into occasional slideshows if RTX was bumped up to the highest setting.Despite some technical foibles and the simple, unchallenging stealth and puzzle solving, I fell completely in love with The Medium. The writing stacks up to the very best in the genre with its well-crafted mystery that explores difficult, often heartbreakingly relatable themes on its way to a satisfying, though not uplifting conclusion. Top-notch actors realize complex and memorable heroes and monsters along the way, and the score, sound design, and art are gorgeous, pulling together an unforgettable, cohesive whole.

The Medium,Ben Reeves,Game Informer,https://www.gameinformer.com/review/the-medium/the-medium-review-grave-new-world,"With our five senses, we perceive a great deal of the world around us. But what if another world exists behind the one we see? What if a second reality sits just behind the façade of our experiences? And, what if this reality is full of spirits we cannot see and cannot touch, who brush past us on a daily basis? Bloober Team attempts to explore this mysterious spirit realm with its puzzle-filled horror adventure, The Medium. Sadly, Bloober Team’s vision for an unseen reality isn’t that exciting to look at.Marianne is a supernatural medium who can talk to the dead, but when she receives a mysterious phone call summoning her to a derelict hotel on the outskirts of Kraków, Poland, her talents are truly tested. When Marianne arrives at the resort, the only inhabitants she encounters are tormented lost souls and an invisible monster who forces Marianne to wrestle with her past. The Medium’s narrative starts with a lot of promise, but quickly loses steam. Marianne doesn’t have much of a personality, and is little more than a cipher to move the plot along. Moreover, certain details are hard to follow, and The Medium's few interesting twists (near the end of the game) feel unearned.It’s unfortunate that The Medium’s narrative doesn’t shine, because a solid story may have pulled me through its uninspired gameplay. As Marianne communes with the dead, she is occasionally tasked with solving simple puzzles, such as rerouting the power to a car lift or finding the missing pieces to a broken mirror. Sadly, only a small handful of these puzzles ask the player to look for clever solutions. For example, I enjoyed paying attention to clues in my environment to decipher the passcode for a locked door, but most of the time I felt like I was completing grunt work, hauling random items from one end of the environment to the other so I could place them back where they obviously belong.The Medium’s one unique element comes from how it handles the spirit realm. At designated points in the story, Marianne inhabits both the real world and the spirit world at the same time. During these sequences, the screen splits in half to show Marianne’s location in each realm. A room that is blocked off in the real world might be open in the spirit realm, which encourages you to carefully explore both realities and find a way forward. This is a neat idea, and I enjoyed manipulating objects in one realm to affect the other. But even in the spirit realm, most puzzles boil down to returning objects to their proper place. The spirit realm is also incredibly drab, and its overtly grotesque design diminished my enthusiasm for crossing realities. I love good, creepy atmosphere, but The Medium’s environments are simply grotesque environments formed of human-like skin, not terror-inducing locales.Like a lot of modern horror games, The Medium forgoes traditional combat mechanics in an effort to amplify the scares – but this doesn't do enough to turn up the tension. The Medium sets the stage for several chilling moments, but often fails to deliver. For example, Marianne occasionally encounters a powerful beast that forces her to either run or hide. These moments seem thrilling at first, but the monster is so easy to evade that it quickly stops feeling like a threat. The stealth sequences are particularly disappointing because they are so linear that there is never any question on where you need to hide; these moments are more like trials in patience as you wait for the monster to move on so you can creep forward to the next hidey-hole. Some of the best horror games of the last decade have offered combat-free frights. After all, abandoned buildings are scarier when you can’t push back against the shadows. However, The Medium’s lack of combat highlights the challenge of letting atmosphere and puzzles carry a horror experience. The idea of exploring split realities is neat, but Bloober Team needed another gameplay hook to hang its hat on, because this horror show is a bit shallow.

The Medium,Suriel Vazquez,Polygon,https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22250793/the-medium-review-pc-xbox-series-x-s,"Filed under:Bloober Team’s horror game gets bogged down by tired tropesThe first spirit you see in The Medium is someone you know. It’s your foster father Jack, a man with a warm smile and a beleaguered cadence to his voice. As Marianne, a funeral home worker with the ability to enter the spirit world and communicate with the dead, you knew this moment was coming. That doesn’t make it any easier.After Jack’s spirit manifests in the funeral home and breaks a vase, Marianne finds and deals with him the way she’s done with so many other spirits before him. Jack isn’t malevolent or somehow twisted into a monster by his vices and regrets; he’s confused and tired, not entirely sure of what’s going on. After one final conversation with her loved one — something Marianne admits few others get to have — she sees him off to face the next life in peace.It’s a touching opening, and a hint at the kinds of ghost stories The Medium seems poised to tell: ones in which the dead must confront personal issues instead of curses or demons. And for a while, the game sticks to that tone, grounding Marianne’s eventual journey into the spirit world in a thick history, one filled with haunted people and places. But as its dual-world concept comes into focus and its ghost stories wade into muddier waters, The Medium doesn’t build on these intriguing threads, and instead begins to follow a more rote horror framework.After Marianne sees her foster father off, she gets a call from a stranger named Thomas, urging her to come to the Niwa Worker’s Resort just outside Krakow, Poland, and dangling answers about a recurring dream Marianne has been trying to decipher for most of her life. When she arrives, the resort is abandoned and padlocked. Marianne has to find her way inside.The Medium is a fairly straightforward adventure game; you explore environments as Marianne from set camera angles, and have to move objects to climb walls, use keys to open doors, and examine items to glean a little history from them using your medium powers. Throughout, The Medium makes sure you can’t forget the weight that history can have on a place. Before you ride into the resort, a TV-style opening credits sequence bombards you with dozens of black-and-white stock footage shots, setting the mood for when you find all the cheerful townsfolk suddenly gone. As you explore the resort, you see chalk drawings in the parking lot, then notes written in the lobby by the resort’s inhabitants and signage created by its owners on the walls.It’s here that The Medium begins to flex its central hook: Marianne can manifest herself in both the physical and spiritual worlds, which are largely the same, but in key ways are asymmetrical. She can split herself up and examine specters of people’s pasts by channeling objects, too, which opens up the first few areas of the resort to some mildly interesting puzzles in which you need to move the spirit-world Marianne through an area impassable to her in the physical world, then flip a switch or use her spirit-world energy to turn on a fuse box to power an elevator. The puzzles make some interesting use of both worlds, but none of them stand out as particularly clever, making the whole concept feel underutilized.Several cutscenes also play out in both worlds at once, a neat idea that also doesn’t end up being crucial. While I regularly saw Marianne talking with an otherworldly presence in the spirit world but acting by herself in the physical world on the same screen, I never caught a character speaking in one world and another character’s reaction to what they’re saying in the other, or anything else that rewarded me for darting my eyes between the two halves of the screen.The two-world conceit instead works best as a way to take in the stories of the ghosts you encounter. You soon meet up with Sadness, the spirit of a young girl with a missing arm who helps you put together a few details about why Thomas brought you to the resort, and assists you with a few puzzles along the way. The rapport between Marianne and Sadness is, again, touching, a source of light and company in an otherwise dark and lonely silence.The spirit world is a realm of metaphors, and The Medium doesn’t let you forget it. When Marianne finds a razor blade in the spirit world that she can use to cut through what appear to be walls of flesh, she immediately remarks, “This thing isn’t a razor. It’s ... guilt. Shame. Regret.” That line is a particularly egregious example of the story interpreting itself for you, but it’s indicative of the game’s overall tone. The metaphors you encounter — abusers represented as literal monsters, or traumatic events made manifest in historical artifacts — lack the kind of ambiguity or occasional conflicting meanings that can make horror and mysticism so enticing. Instead, the meanings have been laid out for you, leaving you with few opportunities to interpret or dig deeper.Over time, The Medium becomes far more concerned with the secrets behind Thomas’ call, but this plot line, for all its twists, is much less interesting than the early, more empathetic tales of the dearly departed. Rather than focusing on stories that capture the feeling of loss of both individual people and their communities, The Medium pivots to a story about personal trauma as a catalyst for cycles of violence, as one person’s traumatic childhood causes them to inflict that same pain on someone else. Here, again, The Medium is not subtle; it uses extreme backstories like child abuse as shortcuts to establish characters as victims or villains, making a strong connection between “terrible thing happens to person” and “person is overcome by terrible thing.” The trauma we face inarguably affects and changes us as people, but The Medium doesn’t deliver that message in a compelling way. Instead, it paints with too broad a brush, smothering strokes of black and white in a way that leaves little room for interpretation or nuance. Interacting with both the physical and spiritual worlds also quickly loses its charm. Marianne eventually becomes the target of The Maw, a monster from the spirit world that can’t be killed, and which you must hide from in a few stealth sections in both worlds. I thankfully never had to fight the thing, but every time I’d have to hide or run from The Maw, it felt like something I’d already done or encountered somewhere else. These sequences feel out of place in a game that otherwise seems fairly comfortable moving outside the bounds of traditional horror games.Eventually, The Medium abandons its surprisingly empathetic take on the afterlife altogether to become a thriller, which, while honing in on a single thread, ends up being shallow and disappointing. The twists aren’t predictable but aren’t shocking, either, and while the latter half of the game sets itself up as an intricate web of interconnected relationships and secrets, it teases out hidden identities and other twists for way longer than it took for me to figure them out, leaving me waiting for the story to catch up. By the time I’d rolled credits and began processing what had just happened, I realized I didn’t have many plot points or striking moments to chew on.It’s in these shifts from the quiet history of its locales and characters to an uninteresting suspense story that The Medium turns from a game ready to tackle the heartbreak of losing a loved one — or how that loss can reverberate through others over time — to yet another familiar story about violence. It can’t help but turn the traumatic experiences it wrestles with into trivial plot points to move its story along. As much as its latter half is concerned with doling out big revelations, none of them will stick with me as much as being able to talk to Jack one last time.

    Jordan Ramée
   on January 27, 2021 at 2:31PM PSTThe world of The Medium begs to be closely examined, to be parsed for small details that begin to paint monsters as something not too dissimilar to humans. Recognizing these similarities, at times, can be even more terrifying than facing an actual grotesque creature. There's something disturbing about being forced to confront the evils that humans can inflict on one another, and recognize how horrific acts of sexual abuse, ethnoreligious discrimination, and physical violence rarely, if ever, result in a singular trauma. The aftereffects of such actions can fester in the heart and mind of victims for years, an unsettling truth that is often glossed over. It's here that The Medium finds the basis for its story, one that leaves a lasting impressionIn The Medium, you play as Marianne (voiced by Kelly Burke, who does a fabulous job), a powerful clairvoyant who travels to the Niwa Resort. She goes there in search of Thomas, a man who leaves her a strange message telling her to find and help him, promising that he'll give her the answers she seeks about her past in return. As a medium, Marianne is able to commune with spirits and help them pass on to the afterlife, a skill she's developed working in her foster father's funeral home. To that end, The Medium plays out on two planes of existence: the normal world and the spirit world, the latter of which acts as a twisted reflection of the former.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: The Medium ReviewThe spirit world--inspired by the surreal dystopia portrayed in the paintings of Zdzisław Beksiński--is a nightmarish hellscape, one where the doors are made of human skin that you have to slowly carve open with a rusty knife, and the inhabitants are either monstrous creatures or creepy mask-wearing spirits. Even Marianne takes on a new appearance when navigating the spirit world, the sleeve of her kickass jacket (she's so stylishly put together, I'm jealous as hell) and pant leg becoming frayed, as if this version of her is an incomplete, less-human being. But these two depictions of the world are not black and white opposites. Instead, the game posits that they exist as mirrors of one another--one manifesting literally what the other only hints at figuratively. And via this shared window into both perspectives, The Medium is able to explore the trauma of its characters through puzzle-solving and riddles.As you explore the Niwa Resort in search of Thomas, you'll stumble into areas where the emotional remnants of the world are so powerful, Marianne is forced to traverse the space in both the real and spiritual plane. At this point, your perspective is split, forcing you to look at and explore both worlds simultaneously. Navigating these spaces isn't straightforward, though--a staircase that's still present in the spirit world may have collapsed in the real world, or an empty hallway in the real world may be full of killer moths in the spirit world. And what affects Marianne in one world will do so in the other.These moments of dual-reality occur in a good third of the game, transforming areas into self-contained puzzle boxes where an understanding of the space is necessary for moving forward. For example, putting together certain items in the real world might spark memories that manifest as positive energy in the spirit world that Marianne can then absorb and use to power her supernatural abilities, such as a shield that can protect her from moths. As you continue, the puzzles become more elaborate, encouraging you to take a closer look at the environment in search of clues that might lead you toward the solution to the problem in front of you.The puzzles revolving around the dual-reality of Marianne's life are impressive in their technical achievement and the best part of the game. Bloober Team has spoken about how these moments are actually two different, wholly separate experiences running side by side, a feat the developer could not accomplish when The Medium was first conceptualized as an Xbox 360 game nor even made possible with the Xbox One. Only now, thanks to the powerful hardware and architecture of the Xbox Series X|S can the vision of what Bloober Team wanted for The Medium be realized--and it certainly is impressive. There are in-game ramifications beyond the visual splendor, too. Marianne is able to have an out-of-body experience, allowing you to control only her spirit form for a limited time. When this occurs, the game suspends the real world experience, giving you a chance to quickly explore previously inaccessible sections of the spirit world. When you're done, a brief flash of light hides a very fast load as spirit Marianne returns to the same position as real world Marianne and your controller connects to both versions again. It's incredible how seamlessly the two experiences link up to one another--it can't be any longer than a second or two.But beyond how cool it is to see Xbox's new hardware finally getting a console exclusive that accomplishes something that feels very ""next gen,"" these moments of dual reality also add to The Medium's gameplay. In order to solve a puzzle, for instance, you may need Marianne to be in two places at once or rely on the fact that she can essentially teleport from one place to another. One of my favorite moments in The Medium was when I came face to face with a monster during a moment of dual reality. I had an out-of-body experience and ran down a hallway, the creature chasing after my spirit form. Right before it caught me, I returned to my body, reloading spirit Miranne alongside real-world Marianne, who was able to physically interact with and cut through the chain locking the door, allowing both versions of Marianne to pass through just before my pursuer returned. It was a terrifying and thrilling moment.Regardless of whether they're a part of the dual reality sections or not, the puzzles are satisfying to solve--both for the sense of accomplishment and for how each one gives you a new glimpse into a world you're desperate to understand. Most puzzles require a level of spatial awareness or deductive reasoning; they're less about leaving you stumped and geared more toward smartly navigating spaces. So while you can't guess your way to success, figuring out what to do shouldn't trip you up for very long. And there's a great deal of incentive in solving each puzzle--prior to your arrival, the Niwa Resort suffered a horrifying incident in which almost everyone on the premises died but no one knows why. Journeying deeper into the resort begins to fill in those gaps, unveiling a mystery that compels you to push further through the horror in hopes of finding the answers you seek.Though most of the game revolves around puzzle-solving, there are stealth encounters and chase sequences in The Medium as well. Both of these stem from encounters with The Maw (voiced by Troy Baker), the main antagonist of the game. The Maw is a fairly straightforward chap who is very confident in letting others know what it desires--it wants to strip you down and live inside your skin... because reasons. These instances grant The Medium an opportunity to delve into more traditional horror game tropes, the kind that make it feel like your heart is going to explode out of your chest. And in this way, the fear of running into The Maw provides an ever-present tension.Any time you have the eureka moment of figuring out how to solve a puzzle, it's usually accompanied by the growing dread that you haven't seen The Maw in a while. And that feeling only grows worse once you notice that you now have to travel down a very long hallway to use the item you've just discovered to unlock the next area; it feels like it would be a real inopportune time for you if the creature were to show up, which probably means it's going to show up, whimpering about how cold it is and how you're being very selfish for not letting it try you on, and then growling with malicious glee upon spotting you and demanding you hold still so that it can have its way with your body. I'm not sure what well of horrific creativity that Troy Baker found in order to inform his performance, but we must ensure he never finds it again--he does way too good a job of making The Maw sound creepy as hell. I'm not even really sure how to describe the voice; it's as if a toddler that's struggling for air is cooing in your ear about being a serial killer. You just feel unclean listening to it. The Maw is a deeply unsettling antagonist, made all the more so because you go a great deal of the game not knowing why it wants to be inside you, but knowing that it can appear at almost any time.Thankfully, there are a few systems designed to ensure you don't always outright fail if you make a wrong turn during a chase sequence or accidently stop holding your breath while trying to sneak through a stealth section. When captured--provided you have spirit energy--you can emit a blast that temporarily stuns The Maw, allowing you to keep running or flee to a hiding spot. Marianne can't hold an endless supply of spirit energy (the amount is cleverly indicated by how much of her jacket sleeve is glowing, removing any need for a user interface) but you usually always have enough to escape at least once. So the first time you're caught, it's not necessarily a game over. That doesn't dispel the unnerving atmosphere when The Maw is nearby, of course, nor did it help my unease when exploring the resort, especially during the times when I hadn't had a chance to recharge Marianne's spirit energy in a while and was running dry.That feeling of unease is only heightened by how you're able to perceive The Medium's world. Bloober Team strips you of any agency over the camera, opting for a more cinematic experience where you're at the mercy of predetermined angles for every room. Often, you're forced to view a room from a less-than-ideal perspective; for example, with the camera facing Marianne head-on so that you can only see what's directly behind her, or a faraway shot that showcases just how big the room is and how vulnerable you are. To the game's credit, it's very effective for establishing the tone of every moment, allowing Bloober Team to orchestrate the same type of shot composition seen in well-choreographed horror films or cinematic horror games like Silent Hill.Occasionally, The Medium will combine both the cinematic nature of its shots and the dual reality of its setting to amplify climatic moments, such as extended chase sequences or significant conversations. My favorite examples are the series of talks between Marianne and Sadness, a mysterious spirit of a young girl who cannot remember who she is. Because Sadness is a spirit, she only exists in the spirit realm, and so it looks like the Marianne in the real world is talking to thin air. Bloober Team almost always uses this opportunity to great effect in order to show how Marianne and Sadness' relationship is evolving. For example, the side of the screen that focuses on real-world Marianne may remain as a close-up of her face so that you can read her microexpressions, but not see much else while the spirit world side may showcase how Marianne and Sadness are talking to one another. One camera reveals what Marianne is likely thinking while the other gives us a glimpse as to what she's reacting to.The sound design of The Medium is top-notch, too. Wood creaks beneath your feet, the thudding footsteps of The Maw reverberates into your ears when it's chasing you, and the sound of Marianne replenishing her spirit energy comes as a major relief. The soundtrack is no slouch either, as composers Arkadiusz Reikowski (Layers of Fear 2, Blair Witch) and Akira Yamaoka (the Silent Hill franchise) ensure the music creates a terrifying atmosphere and moments of silence deliver an unnerving one. The music and sounds of The Medium work beautifully (in the most frightening way) to amplify each scene, typically working in tandem with the odd angles of the camera to keep you in a perpetual state of freaking out, but also informing you of Marianne's current state.The Medium does a terrific job of storytelling without explicitly telling you what's going on, so it's disappointing when it goes out of its way to explicitly lay things out. Almost the entire game is a flashback of past events as Marianne recaps her harrowing journey through the Niwa Resort, narrating her innermost thoughts, feelings, and convictions during each moment. She's excessively vocal, often explaining revelations that do not need explaining because the game has already sufficiently established a situation. The most annoying instance of this is when Marianne comments on how she's feeling. Kelly Burke's stellar performance does much of the work in conveying Marianne's mental and emotional state, so getting narration about how she's feeling just after inferring it from the tone in her voice feels redundant. The Medium gives you everything you need to piece together its puzzles and narrative. But whereas it leaves you to solve the puzzles on your own, it goes too far in trying to ensure you never miss a beat of its story. Granted, this straightforward narration does act as a benefit for those that might not be able to pick up on certain visual or auditory cues, ensuring that the necessary information remains accessible, though it feels a bit inelegant in its implementation.The Medium's initial hook of finding Thomas in order to learn about Marianne's origins isn't all that interesting, but, as mentioned before, the walls of Niwa Resort hide many compelling secrets. Early on, you discover evidence of several seemingly unimportant but fascinating stories that speak to what transpired in the days leading up to the massacre that left Niwa Resort abandoned. Many of these stories tie into the puzzles--more often than not, deducing the identity of someone and understanding who they were is key to moving forward. Thus, to understand the puzzle in front of you, you need to empathize with those who once lived there to figure out how they ticked. Even if you can't fully comprehend the scope of their trauma, it's important to acknowledge it and try to understand how it may have shaped them.Two moments in particular stand out, as they involve getting at the heart of trauma that has been kept from others to see. These sections play out in unique dreamscapes inspired by the twisted subconscious mind of the individuals in question. They're both harrowing and intense--you're cutting away at the defenses that someone has erected against the most traumatic moments of their life, so it can occasionally feel like you're the monster in this scenario, triggering someone for no other reason than better understanding them for your own personal gain. But in both instances, you're entering the mind of victims that went on to become victimizers themselves, ones who wielded their trauma as an excuse for the horrific abuse they went on to enact on others.At the core of The Medium is the idea that there are usually always two ways of perceiving something or someone. The puzzles, dual reality gameplay, and overall story support this central theme, revealing instances of human behavior that showcase how bad deeds can occasionally have good motivations (or vice versa). In most instances, The Medium leaves it up to player interpretation as to whether someone was good or bad. The aforementioned sections where you dive into the psyche of abusers are the game's acknowledgement that there is an exception to how much agency you have in how you judge someone, even when there are two sides of a story. In both cases, Marianne outright rejects the use of a miserable or abusive upbringing to forgive evil actions. You can feel bad for a villain on account of what happened to them, but that doesn't mean you should ever forgive what they did. It's an important distinction and one I'm glad the game makes, utilizing both an example of an abuser who accidently shielded their guilt with their trauma and one who purposely did so, in order to make the point that both instances are not okay. The latter is far worse, but neither is inexcusable.And I think therein lies why The Medium works as well as it does. It's a horror game--no doubt about that. I have a whole camera reel of screenshots of the times the game scared me so bad I tried to pause it to compose myself, only to hit the screenshot button by mistake. But if anything, it feels more like a game about the aftermath of horror, and how living with unresolved trauma can create nightmares as damaging as the initial event. As scary as it is to be chased by a monster, it's the terrifying display of how one traumatizing act--even after it's been justly punished--can still create such a ripple effect that, years later, it continues to affect the victim, those around them, and even complete strangers. The Medium posits that there is no single victim in a traumatic event, and then through its characters and environmental storytelling, builds proofs to its hypothesis that are difficult to disagree with.Eventually The Medium's narrative threads begin to weave together, even connecting to the original goal of discovering Marianne's origins. The promise that everything somehow connects in some unforeseen and fascinating way is a thrilling reason to see the game all the way through. The connections to real-world events of Polish history make many of the revelations even more poignant--even if the supernatural aspects are fictional, it's deeply unsettling to think about how some of the evil present in this game did actually occur.And to that end, The Medium's conclusion sticks with you; it's one last horrifying reminder that trauma may not define a person, but it can have consequences we can't even begin to foresee if it's not adequately dealt with and simply left to fester over time. I can't say I enjoyed the ending to The Medium, but I am deeply satisfied with how it sets up the inescapable nature of its horrifying conclusion.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"
The Medium,Zack Zwiezen,Kotaku,https://kotaku.com/the-medium-the-kotaku-review-1846129608,"The Medium is stuck between two types of video games. It seems like a throwback to classic, claustrophobic horror titles such as Silent Hill and Resident Evil, but it also feels like a more modern non-combat, narrative-focused scary game. The end result is a game that feels middle of the road. This is disappointing, because it contains some great ideas and has a strong second half. But too much of the game buries these bright spots under stretches of boredom.(This review was originally published on Jan. 27, 2021. With the release of The Medium on PS5 we’ve updated and republished our original review.) Developed by Bloober Team, the horror specialists behind Layers of Fear and the recent Blair Witch game, The Medium is something different. Where those previous games were focused on first-person gameplay, The Medium is a third-person game that uses static camera angles, giving the game a retro-feel. Adding to this feeling, the entire storyline of the game is set in Poland during the late-90s when classic survival horror games like Silent Hill were popular.In The Medium, you play as Marianne, a woman who is also a medium, able to connect and interact with dead people, their spirits, and the “other side.” In fact, she can actually traverse the other side of reality, directly interacting with the dead and helping them move on. This is a major part of the game, with the screen splitting in two, as you play in both the real world and spirit world at the same time. In action, it’s impressive and might be one of the reasons this game is only playable on the new Xbox Series X and S and not the Xbox One, as I assume rendering two worlds at once takes extra power older machines might lack.The game starts after the death of Marianne’s adoptive father. She gets a mysterious phone call from someone at Newa, an abandoned government-run vacation lodge. Once she arrives, it becomes clear that this place hides some dark secrets and a lot of suffering. Quickly, using your powers, you befriend a young girl who goes by the name of Sadness and who helps guide you around Newa, as you meet other, nastier spirits and characters. Along the way, a dangerous entity known only as The Creature hunts you down, both in the spirit world and the real world. To stop this deadly monster and help Sadness move on, you’ll have to uncover all the deep, dark secrets of Newa and confront your own past. Doing so involves a lot of door and key puzzles.The Medium’s story takes a while to get anywhere, with the first half filled with vagueness, cliches. But once the creature begins showing up more and I learned about Sadness and her family, The Medium’s tale hooked me. Then the ending, which feels rushed, brought back my disappointment, as it ends in all too vague a manner. Boo! Don’t make me care about your characters, world, and story only to pull the plug at the last minute and leave me hanging.I try to not spoil games too much when reviewing them, but I do feel obligated to mention that a part of the game’s narrative involves a pedophile and their victim as well as that person’s history. Their connection to the story is impossible to ignore and while the game never shares explicit details or imagery, thankfully, it’s still alluded to and mentioned multiple times. It’s all gross and sadly never gets fully resolved. Consider this a content warning. If pedophilia, even minor mentions or references to it, is something you want to avoid, and I don’t blame you, The Medium is probably a game you should skip. To reach the unsatisfying conclusion, you’ll have to play through a lot of empty areas and backtracking-based puzzles. Do you like searching for keys and levers over and over? I hope so, because that’s a lot of what you do in this game. Another issue is that The Medium’s main creature is scary, but is also the only real threat in the entire game. That lack of a threat, combined with the simplistic puzzle design, makes too much of the game a bore. There are no random zombies or ghostly demons to fight. There’s essentially no-combat at all, outside of some areas that have you burning ghost moths with spirit energy. This means a lot of time is spent running around larger-than-necessary levels, with no threat of death or failure, trying to desperately find the one small item needed to press forward. Often, any feelings of fear quickly turned to frustration and boredom as I searched around maze-like areas looking for a valve or small piece of paper. The static cameras don’t help, as I often found myself getting lost in some areas when the camera wildly flipped to a new angle or didn’t flip soon enough, so I watched as my character walked off-screen.""Excuse Me, Creepy Ghost Monster, I’m Looking For A Valve.”Reality-Bending-Psychological-Horror Split reality system, second half of the story, visualsBad start, ambiguous ending, dull puzzles, backtracking and performance issuesBloober TeamJanuary 28, 2021Xbox Series X (Played), Xbox Series S, PS5, PC9 hoursThe real saving grace for The Medium and its mediocre puzzles is the use of the spirit world. This is the big hook, and it’s genuinely cool and fresh. Throughout The Medium, Marrianne will occasionally “split” herself between two realms. One is the boring real world, the other is a strange dimension that looks a lot like Hell as it appeared in the Keanu Reeves film Constantine. One Marrianne stays in the real world while another ghostly one explores, at the same time, the spirit realm.The two-world system spices up what would have been more plain puzzles. For example, in the real world, there might be a locked door, but in the spirit world, it’s an open entryway. So you can temporarily leave your body and walk around as just a spirit, potentially unlocking a new path or getting an item you needed from the spirit world to the real world. Other times you’ll need to find something in the real world to unlock a path or item in the spirit world.Sadly, I never felt like the game truly took advantage of its two-reality system. There’s no big final level that tests all your spirit world knowledge and skills. And that might be because outside of a few instances where you use your spirit self to shoot some energy or burn some moths, there’s not much else to do in the game. You walk around, you pick up stuff, you read some notes and in a few small instances, you get some cutscenes through the eyes of someone else. This simplicity, coupled with a lack of combat, one enemy who is fairly easy to avoid and areas that look good but are filled with the same puzzles over and over made me lose interest.It’s a shame, because I did enjoy the world Bloober Team had created and many of the cutscenes were fantastic. I also dug the idea of playing in two different realities at once. But so much of The Medium just didn’t connect with me. Horror games shouldn’t be boring or frustrating, yet that’s what I felt a lot over the nine hours it took to finish the game. Some wonky controls and performance issues didn’t help improve things either.In a different reality, I could see this game being something special. And it might, like so many other horror games and movies, go on to become a cult classic. But in this realm, for me, it just doesn’t come together. "

The Medium review for Xbox Series X|S and PC.The Medium is Bloober Team’s most ambitious title so far, but it sticks close to the studio’s roots. Initially announced in 2012, it was shelved to allow the technology to develop so the studio could tell the story it wanted to without compromise.The ability to interact with two separate instances of a game world simultaneously, dubbed the Dual-Reality System, is The Medium‘s unique gimmick, which sets it apart from its horror contemporaries. This gameplay mechanic was the primary aspect of the game that was highlighted pre-release, but the big question was whether or not this would enrich its narrative or if it would be little more than fluff.In The Medium, a spirit world lies parallel to the real world. Within the realm of spirits, emotion and intent are made physical. Though the two planes can interact with each other, they remain almost wholly separate as a rule. Our protagonist, Marianne, breaks this rule by existing as a single entity in two worlds. For her, the spiritual plane can be as easily explored and manipulated as the real world.After her adoptive father’s death, Marianne receives a phone call beckoning her to Niwa Resort by Thomas, a man who claims to know her secret. Having sought answers as to why she has her powers, she makes her way to the long-abandoned facility. Upon her arrival, she becomes caught up in the aftermath of a tragedy that occurred there two decades before.The Medium is a psychological horror game, Bloober Team’s specialty. However, unlike Layers of Fear 2 and Blair Witch, the plot is more grounded. Despite the fantastical notion of a spirit world, the game establishes a natural relationship between the two planes that follows specific rules. Marianne’s issue is that she, and the remaining inhabitants of Niwa Resort, don’t follow these rules.Shortly after arriving at Niwa, Marianne is confronted with The Maw, an entity that is her opposite. This twisted creature originates in the spirit world but can manifest into the real world, at least for a while. It becomes evident after meeting it that The Maw intends to inhabit Marianne’s body so that it can finally fully enter the real world. Its origin and how to defeat it is a central thread of the game’s story.I enjoyed The Medium more than Bloober Team’s most recent efforts, Layers of Fear 2 and Blair Witch. The story is more grounded and relies more on traditional horror techniques to build and maintain suspense. Bloober Team has relied too much on disorienting the player by rapidly switching environments and surreal elements in the past, and I’m glad that both of those narrative tools are almost entirely absent.Unfortunately, the pacing is off. The game starts slow, and it wasn’t until around a quarter of the way through that it really started drawing me in. From there, the story was a crescendo that unfortunately dropped entirely off a cliff-edge in the last 20 minutes of the game. This is far from an issue that affects this studio, though. Many works of horror fumble the climax. However, the ending is an absolute letdown, which made me question the rest of the game’s validity.I’m not someone who needs everything explained to me. I love theory-crafting and what-ifs. However, The Medium leaves the major plotlines of the game unfinished for seemingly no reason. You get to the goal, the mystery has been solved, and you’re just waiting for the denouement when the curtain drops.Ambiguity works best when one or more plot points are open to interpretation, but The Medium ties everything together fairly neatly by the time you reach the end. This makes its lack of resolution incredibly unsatisfying, rather than intriguing and memorable.The environments in The Medium are excellent, especially considering that most of them had to be designed twice. The derelict Niwa resort combines Soviet brutalism with the haunting pastels of family-friendly design. The gray of the real world resort contrasts with the spirit realm’s organic browns and fleshy tones.Seeing an environment in two variations is fascinating. Twisted metal and ruins in the real-world are bone and sinew in the spirit realm. A good portion of the game allows players to interact with both versions, and especially toward its finale, some puzzles require players to move between the two multiple times to solve them.The inspiration the devs took from surrealist Polish painter Zdzisław Beksiński is evident when playing, as the spirit world is almost directly lifted from his paintings. I hope the game brings Beksiński to some new fans, as his work was on par with H.R. Giger, an artist who has been the inspiration for a variety of games over the years.The spirits found throughout Niwa, including The Maw, are haunting and appropriately creepy. The friendlier ones still have decay about them, with crumbling flesh and roughly-hewn porcelain masks. On the other hand, the Maw has a powerful but horrific vitality about it, signifying its strength and ability to exist within both worlds. Troy Baker does an excellent job with the vocals of The Maw, who torments Marianne by beckoning her to let it wear her skin. The creature gives a real Buffalo Bill from Silence of the Lambs vibe, which never failed to make me uncomfortable.The Medium makes use of fixed camera angles to heighten its scares. I’ve always been a fan of fixed camera angles in horror games because it lets the devs show you precisely what they want you to see. The limited viewpoint allows for excellent use of light and shadow, and The Medium‘s use of raytracing enhances that effect. However, raytracing isn’t required to make the game look beautiful. I found that RTX was glitchy for me on PC, likely because a The Medium-specific driver hasn’t been released yet by Nvidia. I turned it off, and the pre-baked lighting is still excellent.The Medium falls short in the time between its puzzles. It’s very linear, which means you’re only able to explore within each little box it puts you in. You basically move from one “puzzle box” to another throughout the game, with corridors linking them. There would be inventory management and combat in a survival horror title to soak up part of this time and keep the suspense up, but here there’s nothing but walking.Because The Medium has no traditional combat, the pacing can become uneven outside of the stealth, puzzle-solving, and exposition. Even the stealth sections are brief and act more like puzzles than anything else. It ends up taking some of the suspense away, as there are clear demarcations between when Marianne is in danger and when she’s safe.When you’re trying to get away from The Maw, you’ll inevitably find something to shock it with or a hole in a wall to crawl into, and the creature will just give up. The Maw is meant to seem like an ever-present danger, but the limited gameplay design leaves it toothless.The split worlds mechanic in The Medium isn’t revolutionary, but it’s something I’d like to see again in a future title. The environments and the interplay between the real and spirit worlds are what makes this game unique, and it’s worth playing through it just to experience the excellent visuals and puzzles.The Medium is a step in the right direction for Bloober Team and I hope that it’s a sign that the studio is moving out of its comfort zone. It’s definitely the most dynamic title from the devs so far. At its best times, The Medium channels Silent Hill, but the rough pacing and limited gameplay outside of puzzle-solving hold it back. Additionally, the unsatisfactory ending leaves a sour note that detracts from the overall experience.7Jason Faulkner is the Senior Editor of Game Revolution and PlayStation LifeStyle.

The Medium,Jordan Devore,Destructoid,https://www.destructoid.com/stories/review-the-medium-617589.phtml,"darkI respect Bloober Team’s persistence in the realm of psychological horror games. They’re not for everyone, and I understand the complaints that their games lack a certain impact, but I like ’em okay.The Medium, Bloober Team’s latest release following the back-to-back Layers of Fear 2 and Blair Witch, feels higher-profile. The horror-adventure game has been pushed quite a bit as an early Xbox Series X/S title due in large part to its distinct “two worlds” split-screen concept, but it’s also out on PC.That’s where I played it, and after seeing the recommended specs, I was surprised to have pretty good performance with my setup: an i7-7700K, GTX 1080 Ti, 16 GB RAM, and SSD. I didn’t have to make too many visual compromises at 1080p. Whether Marianne was in the spirit world, the real world, or she was inhabiting both realities at the same time side-by-side, the game ran consistently well for me.But apart from The Medium working on a technical level, is its world worth exploring? Is it actually scary? And what about those stealth encounters with a trash-talking demon voiced by Troy Baker?The Medium (PC [reviewed], Xbox Series X/S)

If those were your concerns coming in, I hear you. Same! Quote unquote “horror games” can mean so many different things these days. I also recognize that composer Akira Yamaoka’s involvement in The Medium has roped in Silent Hill fans, some of whom may not know exactly what they’re getting into.This team has a knack for creating creepy scenarios that sound cool on paper – in this case, a medium who can exist in the land of the living and the dead simultaneously and channel spirit energy – but those fresh ideas don’t always make it to the finish line. Without compelling gameplay to back it up, a cool hook can fade away. I’d argue that there’s just enough going on here to keep players engaged.It’s the late ’90s, and Marianne is summoned from her home in Krakow to investigate the remote Niwa Hotel – a resort that was abandoned years ago after a bizarre massacre. The old compound has a lot of skeletons in its closet, and as a medium who can glean insight from left-behind objects, Marianne needs to piece together what happened at Niwa, who the players are, and eventually, how she fits in.The Medium is very much in line with Bloober Team’s past work, for better and for worse. By that I mean it once again blurs the line between psychological horror and walking sim. There’s one jump-scare, a few quick chase sequences, and several not-too-taxing stealth bits. Otherwise, it’s weirdly low-key.[brid video=”708972″ player=”12899″ title=”The%20Medium%20Review” duration=”397″ description=”In today’s Destructoid Review, we’re getting in touch with our spooky spiritual side with The Medium!

Mechanically, you can expect to inspect a lot of items and listen to audio tidbits that cover past events. The Medium has a few true puzzles, but the rest don’t push back in a meaningful way. There’s no tricky resource management to worry about and there’s no combat.To elaborate, you occasionally will need to sprint away from a recurring demon that wants to wear you as a “skinsuit” – but those moments feel heavily scripted, and they don’t last long. As for the stealth sequences, The Maw is blind in the real world, so there’s no reason whatsoever to rush. I didn’t struggle to sneak by the creature like I thought I might based on the trailers. I will say though, its theme is legit.In some ways, I appreciate the simplicity of this game. You’re never going to feel too lost or unsure about what to do. Items are easy to spot with a “detective vision” Insight ability to outline them. And if you ever grow tired of Marianne’s frequent narration (for the record: I didn’t), you can skip her lines.At the same time, I feel like The Medium could’ve asked far more from its players. It’s too passive. It never throws you in the deep end, so your nerves never really kick in. The game’s main hook, the dual reality split-screen presentation where you control two versions of Marianne at once, looks cooler than it is. These moments are always pre-defined, meaning you won’t manually activate her ability. At most, you’ll have to protect yourself from otherworldly moths using a spirit shield. There aren’t threats to watch out for other than the demon antagonist, and even then, those sequences are self-contained.Apart from a short opening sequence at her adoptive father’s funeral home and a few other areas I won’t spoil, The Medium mostly takes place in and around the abandoned Niwa Hotel complex.It’s a testament to the visual presentation and the snowballing mystery that I never wanted to put this game down. As an adventure game with few if any scary moments and little in the way of intensity, I’m sure it’s not going to click with all horror fans. There’s no way it will. That said, there’s something about The Medium‘s modernized rendition of classic fixed camera angles that I truly enjoyed. It felt cozy.I captured an absurd amount of screenshots – more than I ever could or would use in a review. That goes for the hotel’s dilapidated interiors, the beautifully grotesque ghostscapes, and the scenic woods. Even if my interactions with the world left me wanting, I still had a generally good time exploring it.The Medium took me almost exactly eight hours to finish, and I got most but not all of the optional lore collectibles. While one playthrough was plenty for me, I’m still dwelling on the bigger picture and how everything fits together. Poland is an interesting historical backdrop, one that doesn’t feel like an afterthought. And even though this is largely Marianne’s personal story – much more than expected – it does ultimately branch out. If you care to look, there are world-building dots to consider and connect.I wanted a whole lot more from the split-reality premise, though. I wanted higher stakes. Tension. If this game felt threatening, I’d have a very different outlook. As is, I think it’s decent. Enjoyable enough.My favorite part of The Medium ended up being its “semi-fixed cameras,” which blend old and new design philosophies in a way that seems genuinely palatable in 2021. That’s the real achievement here. I can easily picture a more well-rounded sequel happening, and for what it’s worth, I hope it does.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]AlrightSlightly above average or simply inoffensive. Fans of the genre should enjoy them a bit, but a fair few will be left unfulfilled.

The Medium,Josh Hawkins,Shacknews,https://www.shacknews.com/article/122407/the-medium-review-halfway-there,"New to Shacknews? Signup for a Free AccountAlready have an account? Login NowBloober Team's most ambitious game yet rips back the veil between reality and the spirit world. But is the world beyond worth exploring? Going into Bloober Team’s latest title, I really wasn’t sure what to expect. To say that the developer’s take on horror has evolved and changed throughout its projects would be a bit of an understatement. From the jump-scares of the original Layers of Fear, to the murky and tense world of Observer, the studio has made a name for itself on several different sides of the horror spectrum. With The Medium, though, the team seems to forego the past focuses on jump scares, and instead focuses on a style of horror reminiscent of the Silent Hill games and the original Resident Evil.In The Medium, players step into the shoes of a woman named Marianne, who is a literal medium that can connect with the spirit world. Shortly after the death of a loved one, Marianne receives a mysterious phone call, beckoning her to the remains of an old Polish work camp. From here, players are thrust into a dark mystery as they work to uncover the secrets behind the Niwa (pronounced Niva) work camp, including what happened to the camp’s occupants several years earlier.Unlike Blair Witch, or the previous titles the team has released, The Medium goes for more of a fixed camera angle than a true third-person or first-person angle. This constricts the player's view quite a bit, and while I found that being unable to look around the environments as freely as I wanted was annoying at times—the environments here are easily the best part of the game—the constriction caused by the fixed angles helped drive the amount of tension up throughout the entirety of the game.The camera setup feels really good as you explore the Niwa resort, which is put together quite meticulously. The amount of detail in the world is astounding and really helps bring the abandoned location to life as you move through each of its shadowy rooms. Flickering lights and strange sounds amplify the tension that is present, only helping to further escalate the anxiety that is already growing in your gut as you dig deeper.It doesn’t take long for Marianne to meet her first friend, a little girl named Sadness, a character that might seem unimportant at first, but soon helps push the player deeper into the horrors that await.Bloober Team wastes no time in throwing players into its new dual-reality gameplay, which sees Marianne exploring both the physical world and a weird spirit world at the same time. In most cases this breaks up the gameplay into a format similar to split screen, and it makes for a really interesting way to explore the environments the developers have worked so hard on. This feature is used predominantly throughout the game, so players need to get used to focusing on both scenes very quickly.For the most part, experiencing the game in dual reality is fine. It allows you to go into what Bloober Team calls “out of body” experiences, which lets you explore the spirit world and get past barriers you can’t move in the real world. It’s a unique way to diversify the game’s puzzles and opens the door for some unusual solutions.Despite the perks dual reality does get annoying at certain times, especially during intense chase scenes. Focusing on both sides of the screen at the same time is extremely difficult when you’re focused on getting away from the game's main enemy, The Maw. This often led to me running into walls and getting caught, which forced me to retry from a predetermined save point, something that was often several minutes behind where I died. It was a minor annoyance, but one that grew as the chase scenes continued through the game.One thing that The Medium does really well is atmosphere. The best horror games focus on atmosphere and ambiance to jack up the anxiety in its players and Bloober Team does a really good job this time around. Unlike some horror games which focus on jump scares and other cheap tactics, The Medium is absolutely rife with tension that only builds as players explore. The sounds of dripping water and footsteps as you move through the abandoned halls of Niwa are fantastic and really help drive the fear that rules that place home.There are a lot of callbacks to horror classics like Resident Evil and the Silent Hill games, with much of the music sometimes feeling like it was ripped straight out out of the Silent Hill OST. Audio design is one of the best ways to push a horror game to the next level, and The Medium delivers in almost all aspects of that particular category.These highs are pockmarked with lows, though, and all the good comes to a grinding halt as players dig deeper into Marianne’s story.The Medium tries to tell a deep and meaningful story that lets players connect to the characters and experience their heartache. Unfortunately, it’s never really sure what it wants to do. There are times where the players are completely ripped from controlling Marianne as they explore other characters and it just feels like a cheap way to go about expanding on that part of her story.There are also a lot of instances of what writers call telling and not showing. This is something that can completely ruin a story, as the audience doesn’t get to discover things for themselves, nor are they given a chance to come to that conclusion. Instead, the game simply says it is, so it must be. There were quite a few big story reveals that felt hollow because of this, and it’s something I’d love to see developers stepping away from, especially in story-driven titles like The Medium.At its core, The Medium does a good job of offering a unique take on the old, haunted location tropes. There are some nice twists, and while they don’t reach their full potential, they do tell a decent story. Unfortunately, all of the good bits of the story are wasted on an unfulfilling ending that feels rushed. The game drops its biggest twist and then you’re immediately walking into the ending without any chance to digest it. This is further made worse by an after-credits cutscene that almost feels like Bloober Team leaving the story open for a sequel.Despite the wrong steps, there is good in The Medium. If you want a decent horror story to wade through, which offers telltale signs of the classics we’ve come to know and love, then Bloober Team’s latest is just that. There are mistakes along the way, and some things could have been done better, but ultimately The Medium feels like a game that meets you in the middle, straddling the line between mediocre and really good.This review is based on a PC code provided by the publisher. The Medium is rated M and will release on PC and Xbox Series X|S on January 28, 2021.Joshua holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Creative Writing and has been exploring the world of video games for as long as he can remember.

The Medium,Tom Orry,VG247,https://www.vg247.com/2021/01/27/the-medium-review/,"Bloober Team's latest goes under the microscope in our The Medium review.The Medium isn't really the game I thought it was. Maybe I should have been paying closer attention to Bloober Team's Xbox Series X|S and PC exclusive, but this is an old-school horror game through the lens of next-gen power and possibilities. This isn't a triple-A game, it's a bit rough at points, it's heavy on story over action, and might come across to some as mechanically archaic, but for many reasons The Medium clicked with me. This isn't an exclusive Xbox fans will scream about on social media, but it's one that the right audience will find is a sometimes gorgeous, impressively atmospheric tale.It didn't take long to be taken back to the original Alone in the Dark, Ecstatica, and even Resident Evil. The unexpected arguably begins with the camera, which is fixed, with the shot switching to the most useful for atmospheric and gameplay purposes. The Medium is also almost entirely devoid of combat. The threat that exists is mild, the puzzles are neat if not genius, and sometimes you walk awkwardly in the wrong direction because the camera shot changed. But, I enjoyed almost every moment - as much as you can enjoy a game about the darkest of secrets and their painful discovery.Marianne is troubled. Not only has her foster father Jack recently died, but her head is full of visions. These nightmares prove to be more than manifestations of her mind, with Marianne able to see a parallel spirit world. This is The Medium's big hook, as for large chunks of the game you get to see both worlds side by side, Marianne moving through each in split-screen, and interacting with objects as they appear in each world. It's far from a gimmick, with key characters living in the spirit world, and some puzzles tied to how you play in both simultaneously. It looks damn cool.To help you navigate through the puzzles you have access to a number of skills only people with Marianne's skillset are capable of. As well as being able to conjure an energy shield (useful to move through swarms of moths) and energy blasts (one shock in spirit land will power a device in the normal world), Marianne can use an enhanced vision mode to spot hidden objects while in our world.While most spirit world gameplay sees you controlling Marianne in both worlds, which never gets old, you can activate an out of body experience and control her just in the spirit world. This mode is time-limited so you can't roam around indefinitely, but it's another smart way to add more variety to puzzles. Other than one moment early on, and some late-game headscratchers (which only required a little extra thought) the challenge here isn't high, but it's enough. The Medium isn't a game that really puts up a fight. You're on a journey to find out the truth rather than find out if you're an expert gamer. I was happy with that.Story is a key part of The Medium, so you won't find any spoilers here. What can be said is that Bloober has done a great job crafting a multi-generation, multi-reality yarn that all comes together nicely as key plot points start to unravel. The storytelling itself is the studio at its best yet, and benefits from excellent vocal performances from Mary Elizabeth McGlynn, Troy Baker, and others.As a next-gen Xbox console exclusive a lot of attention will be on The Medium's graphics. Even though Bloober Team isn't a triple-A studio (and isn't shy about saying as much), comparisons to other exclusives on the new consoles will be plentiful and likely vociferous. While no doubt unfair to put this smaller effort up against mega-budget titles, at points The Medium is able to handle itself extremely well. There's some superbly lit scenes on offer, and the woodland environment (especially when you also see the hellish spirit world alongside it) is often gorgeous. But it's not all up to that standard.I played on Xbox Series X and the frame rate didn't seem silky smooth. There's also a fair bit of detail and texture load-in - something I'd hoped the SSDs in these new consoles would eliminate - and a varying mix of art quality on show throughout. Parts of this game are wonderful to look at, and give me confidence that Bloober will one day rival some of the industry's heavy hitters, but others feel bland and uninspired. There's also a fairly common slight disconnect with the player character and the world itself, although again this is sometimes exacerbated by the look of the environment.These blemishes shouldn't put you off what is still technically an extremely impressive game. The way the two worlds are displayed alongside each other, Marianne moving identically in each, is awesome. So too is the way you can sometimes trigger a complete switch between worlds. It's not dissimilar to how you can flick between old-school and modern visuals in the Halo remasters, but it's more impressive here seeing as both worlds look impressive.If you're after action and full-on horror, The Medium will likely leave you wanting, and considerably so. This is more of a slow burn, the twisted plot unravelling over six to eight hours. I found the pacing to be ideal, with the game throwing just enough moments of high intensity into the mix to keep things interesting. There is a big bad of sorts, but don't expect traditional boss fights, with encounters being designed to be intimidating and scary rather than difficult. Bloober clearly wanted everyone to be able to see this story through to its conclusion.A lack of exclusive titles for Xbox Series X|S has put an overly harsh spotlight on The Medium, and I hope it won't result in unfair criticism. No, this isn't a production up to the level you might expect from Naughty Dog or The Coalition. This is an indie game that's performing on the biggest stage, and for the most part it's put on quite the show.

The Medium,Kyle Hanson,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/the-medium-review/,"Few gaming genres present developers with as big a challenge as horror. Crafting an experience that produces an excited or joyful reaction seems easy when compared to creating a tense and scary situation within a virtual environment. Yet we’ve had masterpieces within this space, with many holding up Silent Hill 2 as one of the very best. And yet since it released, few games have even come close to replicating the magic it delivered. Bloober Team looked to do that seemingly impossible task with The Medium, a deeply personal game for the Polish developer. And while much of their work paid off admirably, the final result is a mixed bag.Marianne has always been different. As a “Medium” she lives within two worlds; the world of the living and that of the dead. As far as she knows, she is the only person with this ability, which she has used as a tool to give lost spirits some rest in the after life. When her adoptive father suddenly dies though, she finds herself confronted with the mystery surrounding her powers and her own past after a mysterious call directs her to the Niwa Hotel in rural Poland. Calling back to a recurring dream she has had about a young girl’s murder, the mystery only deepens from there.The Medium wears its inspirations as a badge of honor. Silent Hill (more specifically its first and best sequel) is the biggest, with famed composer Akira Yamaoka crafting the soundtrack in conjunction with Arkadiusz Reikowski. The environments and general gameplay follow suit. Exploring the Niwa Hotel harkens back to those opening moments of delving deeper and deeper into the foggy hell that was Silent Hill.With a fixed camera offering an eerie view of the action, Marianne walks slowly, purposefully, often ploddingly around the environment exploring for clues or triggering switches to access the next area. In some of these areas things are relatively normal. Delapidated, and disturbing, but still within the realm of reality. However, some places have a history and that history has bled through enough for Marianne’s Medium ability to detect.The Medium feels like it could have been better served as a tight, tense 4 hour experienceHere the game introduces its main mechanic of split reality. The screen actually splits, showing you Marianne in her regular and ghostly form, with the world attuned to each. You control both at the same time, navigating the abandoned Niwa Hotel and its surrounding areas while also exploring the spiritual equivalent in the other half of the screen. Fleshy walls, dark passages, and spiritual obstacles replace the concrete and forests of Poland in 1999. Actions in one world impact the other, oftentimes requiring you to accomplish a task in the real or spiritual world in order to progress in the other.While this was a large part of the marketing for The Medium, these moments are still somewhat rare, only accounting for maybe one third of the eight to ten hour experience. But that doesn’t mean most of your gameplay is spent in the regular world. Other times you can shift between worlds using specifically placed mirrors. This feels much more similar to how dual worlds have been handled in other games, and The Medium suffers somewhat by losing out on its main gimmick.More detrimental to the player’s overall enjoyment though is that there’s simply not much interesting going on in either world. The spiritual world is solid eye candy, for those who get enjoyment out of the horrific and grotesque, but there’s not much to actually do once you get over the spectacle. The only enemies in The Medium are of the unkillable variety, while obstacles are typically a quick jaunt down a hallway away from being overcome.One of the most complex elements of The Medium is the spiritual energy mechanic. This is where objects of great power can be drained into Marianne, giving her the ability to activate a switch or traverse dangerous terrain via a shield. While some of these require a quick puzzle solve where you recharge the object in order to use its power somewhere else, they almost always boil down to exploring the environment, finding an item, and simply placing it somewhere else.These types of puzzles aren’t too dissimilar from what worked well in Silent Hill, Resident Evil, and other games that inspired The Medium and its genre staples. However, those games offered a larger environment to explore, with more puzzles active at any one time. In The Medium you are almost always progressing forward along a set path, with rare chances to actually explore or navigate the environment in any complex way. So typically you run into an obstacle, look in the nearby area to find all the items and clues, then solve it and move on. If you get stuck you can use “Insight” to sense spiritual energy, which is basically a hint system with some required uses. It’s mostly mindless work that simply pads out what would have been a much shorter, but likely more enjoyable runtime.With no combat to speak of, the time in between these “puzzles” isn’t that much more engaging either. Marianne, and other characters you occasionally control, moves so slowly it can become frustrating. Even when the action picks up, the game is so set on rails that you don’t feel any tension or excitement. You’re moving toward a pre-determined outcome no matter what you do, so just press the right buttons and move in the right direction until the game shows you that the task is complete.Many times these sections seem to be trying to induce terror, with red/green lighting, loud noises, and ominous environments which do truly look fantastic, especially with the ray traced lighting offered on Xbox Series X. But the action is so slow and the result so definite that it’s tough to muster more than annoyance at having to do all these things. Some stealth moments are introduced later on, but they are cumbersome and show that this game wasn’t built to sustain them well at all. The Medium feels like it could have been better served as a tight, tense 4 hour experience, but has instead had roadblocks and long sections or repetitive gameplay inserted to get it to an acceptable level.Much the same can be said about the story, which feels like it has a clear plot and message to deliver but instead mixes things up to create the facade of complexity and intrigue. Starting off with the framing device of Marianne telling this as a story falls apart at various points and feels quite forced once all is revealed. There are also moments that draw on historical knowledge that isn’t quite expressed in the game itself, causing potential confusion. Add on the many times the game comes up to a crescendo in the story then cuts away to tell what appears to be a separate tale, lacking any context until long after the relevent portions have faded from memory, and the plot simply doesn’t deliver like it should either.And yet, with all these flaws I still felt an admiration and appreciationg for The Medium. It’s a game that was clearly developed with heart and delivers some of the horror vibes so many gamers yearn for. The opening hours especially feel like coming home to Silent Hill style horror once again and will have players excited for what’s to come. Fantastic character and environmental design help enhance this feeling. But as the game goes on it is diminished over and over until the ending arrives and things don’t really click the way they needed to to redeem the other problems.The Medium will scratch the horror itch for some for a while but fails to live up to its potential in a number of significant ways. While its world is intriguing it doesn’t do enough to keep players engaged as its story unravels before them. With compelling gameplay this could have worked out, but there’s no real challenge either mentally or physically as you make your way through. Instead all it tests is your patience and your dedication to piecing together the too often fractured narrative.
- This article was updated on January 27th, 2021 Attack of the Fanboy / GAME REVIEWS / The Medium Review"
The Medium,Chris White,God is a Geek,https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/the-medium-review/,"January 28, 2021There’s been a lack of invention within horror titles recently, and it’s about time we had one that did something different with the genre. I’m not saying The Medium is perfect, but Bloober Team has gone to great lengths to make a psychological horror that pulls you in and keeps you guessing, with the occasional squeaky bum moment thrown in for good measure. It has a superb balance in every facet of its design. The atmosphere is consistently eerie and unsettling, but never terrifying. It’s cerebral in its narrative, but doesn’t become contrived or confusing. The pacing is good enough that you’re never bored, and puzzles don’t take a long time to solve, and whilst you do bump into haunting characters and weird creatures, you always feel alone.Throughout the duration of The Medium, I was engrossed in its story. Marianne is a medium who gets a mysterious phone call after saying her final goodbyes to her dead father. As her, you head to the Niwa Hotel, and upon arrival you realise things aren’t what they seem. It’s hard to go into the finer details because of the various twists and reveals, but what I will say is there’s some fantastic writing, both in the plot itself and the characters. Marianne’s state of mind gradually unravels as she works out why she has been called to the hotel, and the few characters she encounters are given significant backstories by the time you eventually meet them. The young girl who exists in the spirit world is innocent yet broken, offering a tragedy for you to uncover, whilst the arrival of the “enigmatic man” Thomas flips the whole game on its head.Many of the locations in The Medium are littered with notes that provide plenty of exposition to the main narrative as well as the residents who lived within the hotel and surrounding areas. You also find objects such as teddy bears, dolls, old shoes, and screwdrivers that can be investigated using insight to hear short conversations of the people they belonged to. The dual realities work incredibly well. By switching between them you can find hidden areas or objects not located in the adjacent worlds. In the spirit world, you can separate from Marianne’s body in the real world to explore these areas or objects, as well as split walls of skin to allow you both to pass through to other areas. There are certain puzzles that will require you to do this as well, such as turning back time in the real world to see the spirit world’s form change, opening opportunities that weren’t there before.There are also watchable “memories” akin to Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture and Tacoma that reveal important story beats, and by turning the left stick these clouds of butterflies form the shapes of the bodies within them. Mirrors can also be passed through from one reality to the next, and when you see both the spirit world and material world existing on screen at the same time, it’s hugely impressive how Bloober Team has made this work so well. If that wasn’t enough, you’re gifted with certain powers as Marianne in the spirit world. You can form a spirit shield to protect you from moths, use shield blast to restore power to generators and power supplies, and shield force for, well, something later in the game.Throughout The Medium, you’re presented with multiple puzzles that require you to think outside the box, much like the Silent Hill and Resident Evil series. You might have to place dead butterflies onto a locked box to open it, remember a number sequence to get into a locked room, or find shards of glass to fix a mirror. Whatever the challenge, they’re different and compelling, drip-feeding you with nuggets of information along the way. When that information starts to materialise into the overall arc, it opens up significantly, and starts to mess with your head. There are some dark themes in The Medium, but they’re never graphic, kept as tasteful as they can be without venturing into obscenity.The influence of Polish surrealist painter Zdzisław Beksiński can be seen in graphic detail within the spirit world, Tendrils of flesh, blankets of skin, and creatures that twitch and convulse as they move highlight the macabre and gothic style he was known for. Both realities have some fantastic details, although the lighting is quite poor at times. Even once you’ve located the flashlight it can be difficult to see anything. Running down poorly lit hallways and across busy rooms often leads to bumping into walls, and when you encounter The Maw, The Medium’s big bad, it can be frustrating to say the least. Whilst we’re on the subject of The Maw, Troy Baker does a great job of highlighting its tormented soul, but when you’re trying to evade it, it’s not clear how you do so at first. I found myself dying five times in a row before I realised you could use your Insight to show its location in the material world.The score is excellent. Arkadiusz Reikowski has consistently put out great music for many of Bloober Team’s previous titles, but the inclusion of Silent Hill legend Akira Yamaoka is the icing on the fly-infested cake. It instills a sense of dread as you walk around the hotel regardless of the reality, but it also welcomes some of the softer moments of the story with a warm melody or two. When you’re exploring the various locations of The Medium, be it inside or out, the music accompanies Marianne’s journey with heart and with fear. It’s a shame movement is often too slow. You can run, but it’s more of a jog. Later in the game you can move much faster, but for most of the hotel section, you’ll plod along as opposed to swiftly skipping from room to room.The Medium is without a doubt Bloober Team’s biggest game to date, and it is easily one of their best. The story is captivating as are its characters, and the uneasy journey you take through it feels much like if Stranger Things was set in the Alan Wake universe. It’s a gorgeous game complimented by a vivid soundtrack, and the gameplay only stumbles on a few occasions. The puzzles are inventive, harking back to a time when the only horrors you could play were ones involving zombies and foggy towns. It’s a great reason to jump on Xbox Game Pass, and a strong start to the new year of gaming.Fantastic Story

The Medium,Richard Allen,GamingTrend,https://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/the-medium-review-the-spiritual-world-comes-to-life-with-unique-use-of-ps5s-features/,"I had long ago accepted that I may not get to play The Medium until well after any hype for the game had passed. I don’t own an Xbox Series X (yet), so I had to settle for watching streamers play through the game while also attempting to not spoil too much of the story for when I could play. Eventually, I stopped paying attention to any news about the game at all, instead opting to wait for the inevitable PS5 announcement.Thankfully, I didn’t have to wait too long. Recently, news came out that The Medium was getting a PS5 port and you can bet that I was first in line, eager for my chance to hop into The Medium’s spooky world. Previously, our Editor in Chief reviewed the Xbox Series X version, so I was also excited to see where he and I agree and disagree, and to see if there are any significant changes between the Xbox Series X and PS5 versions.I won’t go too much into the story details, as our original review broke down the story quite well but essentially you are Marianne, a medium, capable of existing in both our reality and the spiritual reality at once. Due to her unique gifts, she can send lost spirits home, ending their suffering. On the day the man who raised her dies, she receives a call from a mysterious man asking for help. This call leads her to Niwa, where she learns the tragic backstory of the massacre that occurred there and finds herself embroiled in a much larger story than she could have ever anticipated.The Medium is a gorgeous looking game on the PS5. Unlike our Editor in Chief, I did not suffer any scene stutters, texture pop ins, or really any glitches at all except for once during a sequence in a small hallway near the end of the game, and it occurred so quickly it barely registered – in fact, it made me actually realize how well the game had played up until that moment despite the dual realities and various chaotic events playing out on screen throughout. The Medium is an impressive technical product and a great show of what we can expect from this current generation of consoles.Unfortunately, the slightly stiff animation has not changed from the previous release, although it really doesn’t distract from the phenomenal gameplay at all. The Medium plays almost like one of the original Resident Evil games, featuring semi-static backgrounds with fixed camera angles. While this is slightly frustrating, it is rarely much of a hindrance to the gameplay and is the reason why the game boasts such incredible graphics and scenery. I found myself wanting to turn the camera to better explore nooks and crannies, but that isn’t really necessary. The game always lets you know when there is an item that you can interact with, so this gripe really exists due to my preferences, rather than anything the game itself did wrong.The dual reality mechanic is fascinating, while also avoiding the pitfall of being overused. The game constantly finds new ways to incorporate the two worlds, allowing you to eventually jump back and forth almost at will – at least for specific stretches. It is impressive each time you inhabit both worlds, and is really a technical marvel that I feel has not gotten as much attention as it deserved. It’s rare to find something unique in gaming, and I greatly appreciated being surprised by the mechanic – even if what it does boil down to is just a means to create puzzles and obstacles to block your path.The Medium takes full advantage of the PS5’s power and the Dualsense controller’s special features, such as adaptive triggers, which are most notable when charging the Spirit Blast or using similar spirit abilities and haptic feedback, which makes your controller vibrate when enemies hit your Spirit Shield, etc. Of particular note is Bloober Team’s use of the controller’s built-in speaker, which I found particularly creative – various dialogue and sounds will only play through your controller, adding a creepy feeling to many scenes and even being used for background noises at times. It is a small way to make the game more immersive, and works fantastically.Less impressive was the use of motion controls, but really, they just serve as an optional way to view items in game during first person sections and someone may find that more helpful than I did. The touchpad brings up an item menu, and the light bar will begin to flicker when an enemy is near, which – while cool – I can’t say I ever noticed during gameplay. To be honest though,  I didn’t play The Medium in a dark room, which almost certainly hampered the effect. Not controller related, but I do want to mention that in a recent update Bloober Team added ray tracing, making the already impressive lighting effects even more pronounced.The Medium proves to be an interesting look into the human psyche, one that attempts to figure out why individuals are the way they are, while still stating that your past does not excuse your current actions. I greatly enjoyed my time in Marianne’s shoes, and found myself constantly impressed with the incredible graphics and unique mechanics. Bloober Team has made an impressive product, even more so on the PS5 with their willingness to make use of the PS5’s controller’s special features.

The Medium,Ron Burke,GamingTrend,https://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/two-worlds-in-death-they-meet-the-medium-review/,"Marianne knows what lurks just underneath the surface of our world. She’s a medium, able to guide the souls of the dead to the great beyond. She also knows, as Herman Melville once said, that “beneath those stars is a universe of gliding monsters.” She not only guides these wayward souls, but also solves whatever horrors have trapped them there so that they might transition to a peaceful end.While helping prepare a friend’s body for burial, she receives a mysterious phone call. Summoning her to an abandoned resort named Niwa (a real-world location, if you are inclined to pay a visit), she finds more than she bargained for.It’s immediately apparent that Bloober Team are big fans of games like Silent Hill and Amnesia. Marianne’s journey into the corners of the Spirit World are reminiscent of the dark spaces in those styles of games. At Niwa, she begins to unravel the mysteries of this place and starts tapping into her ability to visit the spirit world. What’s different this time, however, is that it’s happening simultaneously.At various parts of the game, Marianne’s spirit is split between the real world and the spirit world, represented by a split screen presentation. Barriers in the real world can prevent passage in the spirit world. In the spirit world, Marianne is able to unleash a spirit blast to fend off spirits or trigger events that can impact the real world. Objects remain rooted in the world they are found, but the interactions between them provide numerous opportunities for dual-world puzzles.In practice, I was only really stumped with one puzzle in The Medium — a date where my math failed me. That isn’t to say the answer is always obvious, but the game does manage to stick to logical conclusions instead of pixel hunting. Marianne can also have an “out of body experience” by parking her physical body and walking around untethered in the spirit world allowing you to stretch past physical barriers, at least for a limited time. Spending too far away from her physical form causes Marianne to begin to deteriorate, blowing bits away from her like ashes.The voice work in The Medium is top notch, with Troy Baker breathing (rasping?) a creepy amount of life into the main antagonist known only as “The Maw.” I can’t find any info on the protagonist, but the voice actress does a stellar job as well. Beyond voice work, the Bloober team brought in power duo Akira Yamaoka and Mary Elizabeth McGlynn — two of the principals behind the soundtrack to Silent Hill. It shows as the game ratchets the tension through unsettling music just as much as it does with punctuated silence.I do have to say that, while the tension is thick throughout, the game doesn’t rely on jump scares to drive the horror. Only once did everyone watching me play jerk in their seat, though everyone winced when I “opened” objects in the spirit world. I won’t spoil it for you.Visually speaking, The Medium looks fantastic on Xbox Series X and PC, with both sporting some impressive raytracing. Shadows are incredibly realistic, which adds even more creepy moments when an elongated claw reaches out to grasp something nearby, only to make you laugh when you realize that it’s your hand and your mind is just playing tricks on you. Lights and shadows flicker and play with your mind throughout the game, always making you think there are more dangers around every corner…and sometimes there are.I did run into a few technical problems on Xbox Series X. I’ve had three hard locks, and the framerate can be somewhat unstable during scene transitions. During normal gameplay you’ll occasionally see the odd hitch, and more often you’ll see textures slow to stream in and popping from low resolution to full resolution. During one sequence with a dollhouse I saw it literally every time I clicked on it — a surprise given that we’ve left spinning disk drives in the rear view mirror.If you played Bloober Team’s Observer then you likely remember a sequence where stealth was required. The Bloober team revamped this sequence when the game was released as Observer: System Redux last year (our review), and for the better. There are several stealth-focused sequences in The Medium, and thankfully they are well-balanced, if not too easy at times. Animations can be a bit odd when combined with the tank-like controls, but overall this game feels fairly well polished, which isn’t surprising since the game’s life started back on the Wii U, PS3, and Xbox One — they’ve had a little time to nail it all down.In all there are about 8 hours of solid gameplay, with another 90 minutes of high quality and uber-creepy cutscenes from start to finish. While the puzzles won’t stump you the second time around, there are lots of little cultural references throughout the game to find. I spotted the stick men from The Blair Witch (another Bloober game), Communist cold war propaganda, and the odd movie and book references throughout. Overall, it felt like just the right length to give it room to breathe, but not to overstay its welcome.With creepy puzzle moments throughout, The Medium pulls off a dual-reality puzzler with precision. The game looks magnificent, with impressive lighting and shadows courtesy of RTX, though the Xbox Series X version suffers from occasional stutters and hitches, as well as level of detail pops. More classic dread than jump scares, it delivers on its promise of horror served two ways, making it unique and a must-have for horror fans, even if it's a little lighter fare.—Ron BurkeSee below for our list of partners and affiliates:One of the longest running independent gaming news, reviews and culture sites on the web.The thing that is magical about the Wizarding World isn’t the magic – it’s...by Ron BurkeThe world is going to end.

The Medium,Tom Hoggins,Telegraph,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/features/medium-review-modern-horror-ideas-old-school-execution/,"
			Bloober Team provides the Xbox Series X/S with its first console exclusive in this psychological horror with a technological twist
		Video game horror has always morphed and mutated in an attempt to find new ways to unsettle its players, but is equally as cannibalistic - feasting on ideas throughout its relatively short history to fatten up newer entries with a sense of dread.The Medium, from Polish developer Bloober Team, is an ambitious and uneven melding of these two approaches, mixing the old-school fixed camera perspective and locked-door puzzling of Resident Evil and Silent Hill with a thoroughly modern technological flourish.You are Marianne, a Warsaw orphan who has the uncanny ability to see into the spirit world, commune with the dead and help lost souls with unfinished business on their way to the afterlife. The Medium’s grand gimmick is that Marianne can both see and inhabit the spirit world and the material world at the same time, a phenomenon handily referred to as ‘The Split’. Your screen is carved into two, the real world on one side and a hellish otherworld on the other. Marianne moves through both but can often find her progress impeded by a locked door in the material world or a quivering barrier of flesh in the other.Goodness knows how this must play out in the poor woman’s head, but for a video game it is a delicious concept to cover. And one that has apparently been technologically tricky to achieve up until now, with the idea for The Medium rattling around in lead designer Wojciech Piejko’s head for the best part of a decade. Now with the fancy background streaming technology of modern hardware, The Medium’s dual realities can be brought to bear.And it is certainly an arresting sight to witness. Following the death of her adoptive undertaker father, Marianne receives a desperate and mysterious phone call from a man imploring her to come to the Niwa worker’s resort in the Polish wilderness. The abandoned resort is thick with atmosphere; crumbling floors and scattered remnants of some untold massacre. But also has a deliberately cool banality that contrasts splendidly with the spirit world when Marianne is in the split. The other side is fire-red and fungal, apparently inspired by the baroque vision of Polish painter Zdzisław Beksiński, with creeping organic tendrils replacing walls, Marianne herself has a shock of white hair, while the small smattering of spirits you encounter have their faces covered with creepy cracked doll masks.It’s a visually impressive feat, if notably familiar. This is a game in clear thrall to Silent Hill, in particular, right down to the (excellent) soundtrack contributed to by Akira Yamaoka. It is helped by The Medium’s commitment to a fixed camera perspective, allowing the developer to frame its creepy milieu. It is effective in cinematic interludes too, with the dual realities showing Marianne conversing with a spirit in one reality while performing to an empty room in another. But the concept never hits its potential across the course of the game, even if it sometimes comes close. Like Bloober’s previous work Layers of Fear, The Medium is more of a guided narrative than a survival horror with simplistic puzzles often restrained to finding items squirreled away in corners to unlock doors in one world or the other.Glimpses of potential do shine through. If Marianne comes across a locked door in the real world, she may be able to briefly separate from her body to explore deeper into the otherworld, with her spirit fluttering away the further she goes. One section has you flipping between worlds through mirrors in an instant, squirrelling through Niwa’s labyrinthine rooms on either side of the divide.But it all comes at the cost of feeling overly prescribed. There is little freedom in your exploration of each world, with you guided to each solution without as much invention as you would like. Occasionally this will work in the game’s favour. Arguably the best section is a genuinely thrilling chase away from The Medium’s persistent monster -the spindly, bat-legged Maw- which flickers between each world at random to keep you on your toes. Otherwise your encounters with the Maw are some fairly rote stealth sequences, which have you holding your breath as it stomps around the room croaking unsettling epithets and demanding to “let him wear you” in so-so sections that are never truly scary.The Medium, perhaps aptly, is an interesting game of “nearly there”. It is creepy but not frightening, intriguing but not wholly engaging, clever without capitalising on it. This translates to its story, which I never lost interest in but neither was I completely hooked. The Medium goes to some dark places, touching on a slew of heavy ideas like mourning, PTSD and child abuse. It doesn’t drop the ball on these, per se, but neither does it feel equipped or committed enough to do them justice.Instead it hungrily moves onto the next horror trope and serves it up with enough style to keep you sated. The Medium is out now for Xbox Series X/S, PC and Xbox Game Pass"
The Medium,Sarah Maria Griffin,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/jan/27/the-medium-review,"Xbox Series X/S, PC; Bloober TeamThis beautiful-looking exploration of intergenerational trauma is ripe ground for innovative storytelling, but fumbles its big themes The nights are still coming in early this January lockdown, and the end of winter is a perfect time to depart the horrors of this reality for those of another. So I spent three nights playing The Medium, Bloober Team’s latest dread-inducing, otherworldly game. On the first night I was thrilled, on the second night I was furious, and by the end I was confused and disappointed.The Medium is a game about duality. Our protagonist, Marianne, inhabits both this world and a spirit realm, and we control her in sync as the screen splits to show us two places, two paths at once. This unusual cinematography and visual design is deeply impressive.The majority of the story takes place at the abandoned site of a massacre: The Niwa Resort, a holiday park in rural Poland, to which Marianne is summoned by a mysterious phone call. This resort setting provides wrecked, tense environments to stalk around – empty swimming pools, doctors’ surgeries, places where children once played. When we experience the spirit side of this location, we see a more abstract interpretation of the pain the massacre caused: surfaces become rancid, tentacles spiral out from nowhere, teeth dapple the walls. In the real world, Marianne is equipped with bolt-cutters to clear her path; in the spirit realm, she cuts open sheaths of flesh with a switchblade made of bone. The puzzles are investigative and tense at first. We listen to echoes of conversations from the past, we gather scraps of paper to piece together the story. Then, towards the start of the second act, it all comes apart.Not unlike Bloober Team’s earlier Layers of Fear, the story is prone to tone-deaf tropes. For example, it reaches to empathise with the paedophile artist who abuses one of the characters, voyaging into the psyche of the abuser during the first of a handful of jarring perspective changes. This narrative displacement may have been intended to be disorienting, but was instead frustrating. Our reserved and confident protagonist disappears for these segments, and we control a male character, Thomas, who inexplicably has double her physical prowess. Where Marianne puzzles her way through cordoned-off areas, Thomas simply blasts them open with powerful psychic energy. Marianne explores Niwa, and Thomas the psyches of bad men. Marianne solves mysteries, Thomas blows things up. This further splitting of the narrative is muddled and slows the pace, jarring the atmosphere.Intergenerational trauma as a theme within horror storytelling can make room for us to explore our own fears within the bounds of fiction, but it needs the space to do so. The Medium attempts to corral postwar horror, child abuse, mass violence, family and monstrosity without ever truly interrogating any of them. The mishandling of such huge subjects defeats the power of the work – by the time we are examining the ninth or 10th ragged toy doll to find a clue, the tension has long dissipated.The Medium is hugely ambitious and could have been a site for incredible, innovative storytelling. Instead, it fumbles sensitive topics, plot points evaporate into thin air, and characters who are studied closely are left behind and never mentioned again. Even while taking notes, the story became difficult to follow. It took me 12 hours over three nights to play, and towards the finale I was astounded by how a game so short could feel so long.This certainly is a game of two worlds: one very beautiful and one very empty, unfortunately leaving us with a game that is all skin and no spirit.The Medium is out January 28; £44.99"
The Medium,Miles Dompier,Windows Central,https://www.windowscentral.com/medium-xbox-review,"No offers foundWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.The Medium has been one of my most anticipated games of the last few years. As a long-time fan of survival-horror games, especially classics like Silent Hill and Fatal Frame, I was excited to see a modern take on this iconic genre. But did this psychological horror title live up to my lofty expectations? In many ways, this ambitious project not only met but even challenged my assumptions of what it would be.Suppose you're a horror fan looking for exciting new ways to experience storytelling through a video game. In that case, The Medium shines with a cast of captivating characters and innovative design decisions. Still, if you're someone looking for high-octane thrills and chills, the slower pacing of this title might not have enough action to keep you hooked.Bottom line: The Medium is one of the most gorgeous horror games I've ever played. Its detailed environments, compelling characters, and unique setting make it a must-play for psychological horror fans.The most important element of any good psychological horror game is the compelling story, preferably filled with nuanced characters and layered interactions. The Medium focuses heavily on Marianne, who tries to reconstruct the memories of her past. The slower, deliberate pacing of cutscenes and world exploration makes this descent into madness, grief, and unimaginable tragedy feel more like playing a devastating horror film in the vein of Hereditary or The Lodge than revisiting games like Silent Hill or Alone in the Dark. As a massive horror movie buff, this is one of the greatest compliments I can give to The Medium.Not only did I find myself enthralled by the mystery of Marianne's strange supernatural history, but I was also captivated by the possibilities of an expanded Medium universe. I wanted to know everything there was to know about Marianne, her family, and the tortured souls you encounter along the way. The moment I finished my first playthrough, I immediately wanted to dive back in and do it all again. As someone who's completed two playthroughs of The Medium so far, I would highly recommend you do the same if you want to fully unpack all the subtleties of this haunting experience.It's also worth noting that this game touches on some serious and incredibly heavy subject matter, so keep that in mind before playing. I won't go into any specifics because I genuinely believe how the story is unraveled and how it's presented through new and innovative gameplay mechanics is its biggest achievement. I wouldn't want to take those initial discoveries away from anyone jumping into this game for the first time. If you're a fan of cryptic character dissections as opposed to more in-your-face exposition, chances are you'll love the delicate examination of the darkest recesses of the human psyche uncovered in this title.The Medium masters world and atmosphere presentation throughout its 6-8-hour story. The environment design team at Bloober consistently delivers engaging locales for you to explore. High-quality textures and ray-tracing makes each of the distinct areas feel grounded and authentic. That goes a long way in supplying immersive, intricate backdrops to your foray into this world of faded nostalgia. Settings like the NIWA Resort, where a good chunk of the game takes place, were based on and modeled after real-world locations. A meticulous level of care is on display in every frame, and this attention to small details makes The Medium one of the most gorgeous horror games I've ever played.To fully showcase the scope of The Medium's dark beauty, the entire game is presented through fixed camera angles. This will definitely be a bit jarring for some players, especially if you've never experienced the infamous tank controls of Resident Evil or Silent Hill. Still, I loved how cinematic this made every moment feel. You never miss a tense scare or subtle environment clue because your camera was facing the wrong direction. Thankfully, some modern enhancements and quality-of-life features for mobility keep things rather intuitive for those worried about how this makes controlling Marianne feel. Seeing this iconic perspective properly revisited in a contemporary horror game gives me hope for its big comeback.The Medium is undoubtedly a visual spectacle in many ways. Considering this is the first true Xbox Series X and S exclusive, and one of the first real showcases of what these next-gen consoles could do, there are a few areas I feel some players might be disappointed.There are major differences between what Silent Hill is and what The Medium wants to be.Let's start with the elephant in the room. The Medium is not 60FPS on Xbox Series X, and the official spec sheet for PC doesn't list anything above 30FPS. The game seems to hover around the 35-40FPS mark during most sequences from our performance analysis. The target here is definitely 30FPS, especially during the dual-reality sections of the game. With fixed camera angles and generally slower pacing, I ultimately think players will be able to look past this after the first few minutes, but it is worth mentioning for all the newfound 60FPS purists out there.Many horror fans have been hyping up The Medium as the spiritual successor to Silent Hill. While it's clear the game pulls plenty of inspiration from that series, there are major differences between what Silent Hill is and what The Medium wants to be. The lack of dedicated combat will absolutely be a divisive design choice. While Marianne has some impressive supernatural powers at her disposal, there isn't much in the way of action outside of a few tense chase sequences. The pacing of The Medium is deliberately very slow and methodical. While I wouldn't go as far as to say that this was an issue I personally had with the game, the focus on story over combat will likely be a complaint for many players.I've been very deliberate in my approach to avoid key story details in my review. I want players diving into The Medium for the first time to genuinely form and build their own character theories, as that was one of my favorite elements of the game. Without touching on any spoilers, the ending will be polarizing. I can't wait for more people to play this so that I can bounce ideas off other horror enthusiasts. After sitting on the grand finale for a few days now, I'm still not quite sure how I feel. There will certainly be some passionate discussions about the ending of The Medium.As a huge horror fan and someone who's played basically every previous Bloober Team title, I can confidently say that The Medium is, hands down, this studio's biggest triumph. Innovative gameplay ideas like dual-reality puzzle-solving and immaculately designed environments elevate this above many other titles in the genre. Instead of replicating a formula from the past, The Medium blazes forward with bold new ideas and innovative mechanisms for character-focused storytelling.Even though The Medium wears its Silent Hill inspirations on its sleeves through fixed camera angles, heady psychological horror, and themes of two distinct realities, The Medium is not Silent Hill. Players who go in wanting it to be will leave disappointed. But instead of critiquing a game for what you want it to be, I implore players to embrace The Medium for the genuinely captivating vessel of great horror game storytelling that it is.The Medium is available from January 28, 2021, as part of Xbox Game Pass across Windows 10 PC and Xbox Series S/X consoles.Bottom line: The Medium stands firmly as the most impressive work from the folks at Bloober Team so far. If you want slow-burn horror presented in a new way, I can't recommend this game enough.Miles Dompier is a Freelance Video Producer for Windows Central, focusing on video content for Windows Central Gaming.

The Medium,Lou Sytsma,COGconnected,https://cogconnected.com/review/the-medium-ps5-review/,"Polish game studio Bloober Team specializes in making psychological horror-thriller games. Their stable of games include Layers of Fear, Observer, and Blair Witch, to name a few. Some of these games were released in PSVR too – most notably, Layers of Fear and Blair Witch. Their newest game is The Medium. Given its nature, this game is not likely to see a PSVR release.Released last January on the Xbox and PC, the Medium has finally come to the PS5. Upon initial release, the PS5 version did not feature ray tracing, but thankfully, this was quickly patched. The game plays at 4K and only 30 FPS. Bit of a shame that a 60 FPS option is not available. While the game employs a unique split-screen mode, the current-gen of consoles are powerful enough to support 60 FPS.Since Bloober Team is a Polish developer, they decided to embrace their culture and history for this game. The Medium takes place in 1990s Poland in an isolated and abandoned hotel, the Niwa – which means cornfield in Polish (another Stephen King shout-out perhaps?) – is out in the middle of the fictional Kiwa Forest. The game is rife with homages to older horror works, be it from the cinema, literature or videogames. A possessed hotel is a direct nod to Stephen King’s Stanley Hotel from The Shining. The Death’s Head moth from Silence of the Lambs appears too. On the videogame side, The Medium uses the locked down camera framing from early installments of the Resident Evil and Silent Hill games.The focus of the game is Marianne, you guessed it, a medium. She is driven to discover how she possesses her spiritual powers, a mystery that is tied into the discarded carcass of the Niwa Hotel. This journey of discovery drives the game. Marianne can traverse two worlds, the one we know as real and the other is the spirit. The two sides affect each other. Actions taken in one world often affect the other side, either directly or indirectly. It is this interaction that Bloober Team uses for the more unique gameplay aspects. Often, an action on one side is used to overcome a barrier or puzzle in its mirror counterpart.In the real world, Marianne adopts a Chuck Norris, Good Guys Wear Black style. She is all dark from head to toe: black hair, leather jacket, jeans, and boots. While in the spirit world, she takes on an ethereal presence with white hair and grayish attire. Actor Kelly Burke voices the character and does yeoman work here, given the somewhat muddled presentation of Marianne. Sometimes the character is all dour and self-deprecating, while other times she is peppy and bubbly. I have to assume this resulted from trying to portray the character through the lenses of the two different worlds. The end result is a rather schizophrenic personality.Marianne has a suite of powers that work in both worlds. She can sense psychic traces of people on objects. Through these traces, she can either hear conversations or reconstruct ghostly scenes that can lead to clues or aid in puzzle solving. She also has a psychic shield, which is used in the mirror world to either repel malignant forces or overcome certain barriers. Marianne can only store so much energy, which is visually represented in the mirror world as a series of fungal looking growth on one arm. The more energy she has, the more rings there are.Another useful tool is one of astral projection with which Marianne can travel the mirror world. This talent is time-limited and if she stays out of body too long, she will die. You use this projection ability to solve puzzles that only exist in the alternate world. Sometimes these puzzles include finding an object like the bone-based straight razor. Mirrors also let Marianne step into the other world and back while in single screen mode.Sometimes the game breaks out into split-screen mode where you control Marianne in both worlds. You can flip between the worlds with a button press. This mechanic is not controllable. You enter split-screen mode when puzzles require manipulation in both worlds. So a multi-step puzzle will have you flipping back and forth between the worlds to solve them. It’s the closest implementation of a single player in coop mode you’ll ever find.Even though the look of the mirror world is based on the paintings of Polish artist, Zidizslaw Beksinski, they come across as very Gigeresque. The same holds true for the look of the straight razor. Biological growths infest the mirror world and oft times look like tumorous skin mated with bizarre spider web support structures. Naturally, the color palette of the mirror world is very drab. Disappointingly, this holds true of the real world as well. It would have been more striking if the color contrast between the two worlds had differed more.Besides Marianne, there are only a few other characters. It is good then that two of them are standouts. One of them, called Sadness, you meet early in the hotel. Sadness exists in the mirror world only and is a one-armed girl with a wooden mask for a face and skin not entirely covering all her joints. Her look invokes empathy and pity, which if further heightened by the expert voice work by Mary Elizabeth McGlynn.The other character is the antagonist known simply as The Maw. Troy Baker provides the voice work and he is very effective. In this game’s version of Mr. X from Resident Evil Two, is The Maw. The Maw relentlessly pursues you. Since there is no combat in the game, you play cat and mouse with him, first in the spirit world and then later in the real world. This character adds a much-needed dose of action and tension into what is basically a quest game.The Medium uses the fixed multiple camera views of the early Resident Evil and Silent Hill games to create tension and a claustrophobic ambience. The downside to this approach is a constant sense of disorientation when you leave one view and progress to the next. You will find yourself course-correcting quite often. The game makes use of DualSense feedback. It’s amazing how even a little dose of controller feedback can make the game feel so much more immersive. It doesn’t beat playing in VR though! The best uses come when you are using your psychic abilities.Music is sparse and uses a low throbbing presence to make you feel isolated and burdened with a heavy load. Sound and environmental cues are excellent and also highlight the mood with disembodied voices moaning or a mournful wind chime tinkling.With each game they release, Bloober Team continues to make strides, and The Medium is another such step. It has an intriguing story with intriguing characters. The game also has a nifty mix of old and new gameplaying elements.*** PS5 Code provided by the publisher ***• Intriguing story and protagonist

Let’s get the elephant in the room out of the way — The Medium is a psychological horror game that wears its Silent Hill 2 inspirations as a badge of honor. And this makes sense, considering that Konami’s 2001 PlayStation 2 classic still holds up as one of the greatest horror games ever made, nearly two decades after its release. And in a lot of ways, The Medium does its progenitor justice, through gorgeous and spooky environments, a twisting story that melds a lot of human trauma with supernatural terror, and some fantastic music by iconic composer Akira Yamaoka. But The Medium also stumbles in some design decisions that feel frustratingly stuck in the past.The Medium is from Polish developer Bloober Team, whose previous works include the PT-inspired Layers of Fear, the cyberpunk horror mystery Observer, and its own take on Blair Witch. This game largely embodies the studio’s visual style and understanding of how to ratchet up tension without relying on cheap jump scares (though there are still a few to be found in its 8 hours), and it stands as one of the most confident horror experiences from the studio thus far.Most of the game is set in Niwa, a remote Polish resort that’s been abandoned for years after an unexplained tragedy led to a massacre that locals only speak about in hushed tones. You play as Marianne, a woman with a lot of questions regarding her past that travels to Niwa in search of answers. As the game’s title might suggest, Marianne has the power to transcend our plane of existence into a spirit realm. Though the ability to speak to your loved ones after they’ve passed might seem like a gift, the tortured hellscape that the other world is presented as makes it clear that, to Marianne, this ability is a curse.This melding of dual worlds is The Medium’s standout feature and the one that’s received the most coverage leading up to its release. At prescribed points throughout the game, Marianne’s vision begins to blur, and suddenly the screen tears in half. One side is still Marianne in the ruins of the Miwa resort, while the other is a version of her in the abyss of the spirit world.The dual-character presentation has shades of games like Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons and FromSoftware’s forgotten PS2 gem The Adventures of Cookie & Cream, and I mean that in a good way. Controlling the two of them at once never got confusing and instead helped strongly define the parallel worlds I was exploring. These sections unfurl naturally, as the screen will sometimes split horizontally and other times vertically. There are different button prompts for each version of Marianne to observe elements of her specific environment, leading to more on-screen real estate being given to the world that’s currently the focus of the story or action. And seeing a specific location in both worlds adds a sense of weight and gravity to the physical space.You’ll oftentimes reach an obstacle in one world that requires something specific to be done in the other in order to advance. This feeds into The Medium’s light sense of adventure game-style puzzles, such as needing to search the environment for keycodes, repairing broken machinery, and moving objects in the real world to create fountains of energy in the spirit realm. The puzzles never got too tricky to really impede my progress, but they also weren’t deep enough to ever elicit that “aha!” endorphin rush that comes from solving a well-crafted challenge.Unlike other games cut from a similar survival horror cloth, The Medium has no traditional combat to speak of. That’s probably a good thing, because the fixed camera and floaty controls aren’t anything to write home about. A few spots contained finicky camera transitions that made navigating Marianne to the exact spot I wanted her to go a bit of a hassle. Coupled with a slow character speed and certain arbitrary moments where you just aren’t allowed to run, and this whole aspect of the game felt a bit too much like it came out of Silent Hill’s PS2 heyday.Thankfully, the game’s visuals more than make up for any of these frustrations. From the warm and lived-in feel of an apartment building in the game’s opening, to the decrepit remains of Niwa, to some beautiful natural environments, the settings throughout The Medium are a joy to experience. The architecture has a strong ‘80s Eastern Bloc aesthetic that makes for a really unique setting to explore. I genuinely loved poking around the resort and slowly piecing together its history through the relics that had been left behind.A lot of The Medium’s backstory is told through discarded documents, echoes of past conversations that play out as short ghost-like vignettes, and rifts into the spirit realm contained within objects of special significance. The game really encourages you to take your time in each area in order to fit the pieces of its bleak mystery together.But the true standout here is the spirit world, which draws heavy inspiration from the art of Zdzisław Beksiński, one of the premier Polish surrealists of the 20th century. His visions of unfathomable dreamscapes come to life throughout the game and provide a constant melding of unique wonder and terror. And the scenes where you’re exploring both versions of the world simultaneously make a good case for why The Medium has been prominently touted as one of the first true “next-gen” Xbox games, seeing as how it’s only available on the Series X | S and PC.The strong art direction is enhanced by an excellent soundtrack co-composed by Akira Yamaoka and featuring the voice of Mary Elizabeth McGlynn, both of whom are synonymous with the soundscape of Silent Hill. Horror games are meant to be played in a dark room with headphones to draw you into the experience, and The Medium is no exception.One of the most propulsive elements of the game is Marianne herself. Her constant narration and observations are well-written and excellently delivered. The bond I grew with her reminded me of the time I spent with Jesse Faden in Control, and slowly unraveling how Marianne was connected to the events that occurred at Miwa became an expanding familial mystery in a similar vein to Netflix’s excellent Haunting of Hill House.But as much as I looked forward to figuring out the story’s twists and turns, The Medium occasionally stumbled over its own design decisions. Its atmosphere, storytelling, and mysteries lose momentum when you’re forced to engage in certain mechanics that feel like they’re pulled from several console generations ago. This includes maintaining your balance as you slowly cross a narrow beam, inelegantly sneaking through a room to avoid an enemy, or running away in a handful of clumsy auto-fail chase sequences.Those last two are particularly annoying and provide some of the most frustrating moments of The Medium. The enemy in question is The Maw, a winged demon voiced with an unnerving high-pitched effectiveness by Troy Baker. But while the creature is compelling at first, evoking shades of the iconic Pale Man from Pan’s Labyrinth, his appearances throughout the game often grind momentum to a halt.Stealth segments involve holding your breath and crouch-walking through a room without being seen by the creature, but there’s no sense of whether you’re actually hidden or which direction The Maw is focused on in a given moment. So it mostly felt like a crapshoot on whether I’d make it through alive or get snatched and have to fumble through the section again. The Maw quickly transforms from something Marianne and the player should fear into an annoyance that you just want to move past.While The Medium’s design stumbles are disappointing, its human characters and gorgeous world are ultimately the things that stuck with me. Once I finally made it to the end of the road, I immediately restarted the campaign to experience all of the narrative breadcrumbs with the newfound clarity of the ending in mind, which is the sign of an effective story. And the game’s day one availability on Xbox Game Pass is just another in a long line of reasons why the service is a must-have. It might not reach the unforgettable highs of James Sutherland’s time in the town of Silent Hill, but The Medium carves out its own corner of the genre that’s worth losing a bit of sleep over."
The Medium,Neil Bolt,PlayStation Universe,https://www.psu.com/reviews/the-medium-review-ps5-an-intriguing-atmospheric-horror-soured-by-its-poorly-handled-story/," Neil Bolt / September 2, 2021The Medium Review (PS5) – Bloober Team’s steady crawl towards becoming a horror game heavyweight looked to be complete when the Polish developer revealed its next-gen title The Medium. Early looks showed promise and ambition, for a company that had been testing and toying with ideas in the likes of Layers of Fear, Observer, and Blair Witch in the past few years. When it arrived on Xbox Series X/S earlier this year, a bit of that promise was fulfilled, but instead of being that jumping-off point for taking Bloober to the next level, it’s made its next move more important than it should have.The game heads to PS5 with less anticipation than it started with for a variety of reasons, but is it still worth investing in this paranormal horror?The Medium deals with a young woman, Marianne, who acts as a medium able to travel into the spirit world whilst still existing in our reality at the same time. She uses this to help restless spirits find closure. The game picks up her story just as she has to attend the funeral of her foster father. She’s not only grieving but is haunted by a recurring dream of a girl being murdered at a lake. A possible solution to her dreams, and an explanation behind her powers, arrives in the form of a phone call from a man named Tom, who claims to hold the answer to both if Marianne is willing to meet at an abandoned resort in the Polish wilderness. Desperate for something to distract from her grief, and more than a little curious what answers she will get, Marianne agrees.Upon arriving at the resort, Marianne discovers that it holds a strong connection with the spirit world, and is home to a murderous entity known as The Maw, which caused an infamous massacre at the resort and has the troubling ability to also exist in both worlds at once. Marianne must stop The Maw and uncover the hideous history of the Niwa Worker’s Resort.The influence of Silent Hill practically smothers The Medium at times. The reliance on storytelling and world exploration over killing monsters, a shift between realities, a dead, corrupted place, and a soundtrack co-created by Silent Hill alumni Akira Yamaoka all make it quite clear what Bloober Team were aiming for, and in all honesty, The Medium does a lot better when it tries to do its own thing rather than ape the highs of Konami’s iconic series. Unfortunately, the comparisons are unavoidable, and paint an overly negative picture of Bloober Team’s game.I’ll get back to that, but there’s plenty of positives to take from The Medium. Firstly, the times where the game splits the screen to show Marianne traversing both worlds at once are superbly handled. Fixed viewpoints ensure things don’t get too complicated, and really make certain set-pieces thrilling like when you see the impact of The Maw’s rampages in the real world whilst seeing it physically in the spirit world. For a relatively small development team such as Bloober, it’s an ambitious feat from a technical standpoint, even with the sacrifices made on performance that it brings.I also applaud the game’s streamlined setup and how that helps its atmosphere to grow via exploration of the Niwa resort and its hellish spirit world counterpart. The gameplay setup is closer to an adventure game than a survival horror, with next to nothing in the combat department, and plenty of world interaction and puzzling to do, and it suits The Medium well. The format is actually very similar to the first-person horror games Bloober previously made, but viewed in a more classical survival horror manner. It can be a bit disorientating for expectations of what The Medium actually offers, but with that knowledge, it begins to feel a lot more natural and logical.It would be nice if some of those interactions were a bit more meaningful or well…interactive. A large portion of them basically exist solely as for Marianne to offload a snippet of dialogue. When the game isn’t splitting between the two worlds, Marianne can use her powers to highlight points of interest, find hidden objects, and solve puzzles by tapping into a view of how things look in the spirit world. It may be little more than The Medium’s version of Detective Mode, but it fits nicely into Marianne’s powers and the world Bloober has built.She can also weaponize her power to a degree, with a defensive spirit shield and a spirit blast (that’s mostly for puzzles). Their use is fairly restrained to ensure the tone and pace keep at least somewhat close to what is intended, sometimes to the point it feels like indecision was met. There’s a few encounters that are dealt with in cutscene form instead of allowing the player to resolve it, and while I understand why, it’s a touch puzzling that they’re built up the way they are.Before I tackle the story, I must mention the one thing that makes the PS5 version superior to the Series X/S version, and that’s the DualSense. The Medium doesn’t necessarily get the best out of the PS5’s controller, but does enough to genuinely add something that wasn’t there before in terms of immersion. Haptic feedback comes into play during attacks on Marianne’s shield, or when she’s having to hold her breath during certain chase sequences. It’s not up there with the best uses of haptic feedback on the system, but it’s clearly more effective than the relatively simple rumble of the Series X controller’s efforts. The adaptive triggers get a run out when charging a spirit blast, changing tension levels as you charge, the speaker and light bar have subtle implementations for some tools, the touch pad can be used in object interaction, and during the game’s brief forays into first-person, the motion control is usable. Small additions in the grand scheme of things, but together they made a distinct impression.So, back to the story, and the ominous shadow over it. In smaller, quieter moments, when The Medium revels in the ghost story of its post-communism world of 1990s Poland, it generally works, but the actual main story gets increasingly heavy-handed before taking an almighty tumble in an attempt to tackle a difficult subject of abuse.I believe there is sincerity in the attempt, but naivety and/or ignorance in how it’s actually approached. It’s handled so poorly that the first time I played it earlier this year, it soured my impression of the preceding hours. Since then, I’ve discussed the game’s failings and now replayed it on PS5, and my feelings on the game’s reveal and journey to it are stronger than ever with foreknowledge, but I still chalk it up to a combination of poor understanding and choppy writing than just a cynical attempt to be controversial. If Bloober learns from that, and works on it then great, you can call this a misfire, but it’s a shame it had to happen in a game I was quite into up until that point, and has increasingly dropped down in my estimation the more I think about, and discuss, it.It’s really frustrating because even now, I believe there’s plenty to commend with the game and its ambition, it’s easy to forgive some failure when ambition is involved, but the main story isn’t part of that. Its crack at dealing with psychological trauma is ripped straight out of the Silent Hill playbook, and even then, Bloober has handled such things better in previous games.Perhaps with Bloober Team’s next game, there’s a need to go back to the drawing board that saw it rise from the murk of making a dreadful Bomberman clone to creating the effective and exciting one-two of Layers of Fear and Observer.The Medium comes to PS5 on September 3, 2021.Review code generously provided by the publisher. The Medium shines when it’s letting you soak in its beautifully crafted dual worlds and melancholic soundtrack, but early promise of a quietly effective ghost story unravels as the story staggers clumsily to a point where it becomes almost unbearable in its attempt to tackle a tough subject.

The Medium,Brett Posner-Ferdman,Push Square,http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/medium,"GuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpAnything but mediumVersion Reviewed: EuropeanWith all the rumours about Bloober Team potentially working on a new Silent Hill game, it's easy to forget why the team rose to fame in the first place. Its most recent project, The Medium, has finally made the jump to the PS5 and it could very well be the best psychological horror experience on the console.The story follows Marianne, a medium with the power to travel between the spirit world and the real world, as she explores an abandoned hotel and the events behind the Niwa Massacre. At certain points, you’ll be able to control both the spirit and real world versions of Marianne to help solve some truly great puzzles. Additionally, unlike Resident Evil, the story is front-and-centre here, and will grip you until the very end.It is undeniable who the target audience of The Medium is. Fans of classic Resident Evil, PT, and of course Silent Hill will immediately feel at home with The Medium. The game borrows elements from each of those games to create a truly terrifying atmosphere that looks and plays great on PS5. The fixed camera angles for example are some of the atmospheric highlights here. Likewise, the extremely limited arsenal at your disposal only adds to the dread you feel as you turn each corner.While the core gameplay of The Medium is undeniably great, there are some minor issues. Movement speeds are incredibly slow, making traversal a slog. The biggest issue comes from the DualSense’s haptic feedback. The rumble is constantly desynced from the gameplay, which ruins the game’s immersion. There are also several instances of slowdown and frame drops.While there are some slight technical issues, The Medium is undeniably a fantastic horror game. For fans of the genre, this game gets an easy recommendation.Great 8/10Scoring PolicyReview copy provided by Bloober TeamUpdate: As of 20th April, 2022 the issues with the DualSense controller mentioned in this review have been resolved.Please note that some external links on this page are affiliate links, which means if you click them and make a purchase we may receive a small percentage of the sale.

Oh this brings back some memories! Awesome game, I really recommend to check it out: very difficult puzzles, creepy and cute, intersting and I don't remember what else because it was a while ago.So… I’ve seen console warriors on Twitter claiming the PS5 version is vastly superior (in terms of graphics and performance) to the XSX version. I’ve also seen console warriors claiming it’s vastly inferior. Obviously neither group even played it on PS5 but out of curiosity - is there a noticeable difference, other than the DualSense support (that hopefully can be patched)?Got it on PC, never completed it. It's less a horror game and more of a point and click. Nothing feels threatening in it.The atmosphere and story and interesting... But the central mechanic of the ""dual worlds, one screen"" is so painfully simply used. It never does any genuinely interesting gameplay ideas or puzzles with the mechanic.My least favourite Blooper game to date 5/10.""One of the best"" probably because there are not that many games on PS5 lol. Heard it is very mediocre at best, 8 seems too good, esp when you gave 4s to many titles that deserved betterI enjoyed it when it originally came out on Gamepass. The graphics are nice and the story kept me interested but the gameplay is clunky and feels dated. My advice is wait for a sale, I don’t think it’s worth full price. If you like this genre it’s absolutely worth checking out at some point, like the review says.One of the best.....not exactly a crowded field though is itPlayed this on series s and I'd say its a 6/10, last gen graphics and the dual worlds mechanic isn't used long enough, some wonky controls and not really horror at all apart from being chased every now and then by some monster. I wouldn't pay full price for thisOn a side note..I heard Russell Grant has escaped from his psychiatric hospital so be aware.Police are looking for a small medium at large.I'll get my coat.It's mediocre trash at best and not scary at all, don't even dare comparing it to classics like Resident Evil and Silent Hill.@Amusei ""mediocre trash""Get help. Seriously.I hope they fix the dualsense support, it's one of the coolest features of ps5 😃@naruball Well people consider a 5/10 (aka mediocre) game as trash, so he is not really wrong, is he?Please Give Silent hill SonyI guess it wins by default since the genre has seen better days. Just finished it since it was free on Gamepass.I would say 6/10. Some of the story elements are interesting but the gameplay is a disaster. The characters walk ridiculously slow (to extend playtime?) and the puzzles are beyond basic.Basically, a door is closed....look for a key (often in the same room) and open the door. Even the ""two realities"" add close to nothing to the experience from a gameplay perspective.Maybe a decent buy for $20. Anything more and you will ñikely be disappointed.Thank you Push Square for an honest review and not bashing this for being a former Xbox exclusive. I liked the game very much on Xbox so I won't be buying it, but it's my favourite Bloober Team game and I found the graphics great, the soundtrack as well. The plot is gripping and the sense of dread does not come from someone or something constantly trying to kill you. I swear some of you guys are just too spoiled.@UltimateOtaku91 I agree. I played this on Series X and it was just okay. I'm wondering if I played the same game as the person that reviewed this.I grew up on games like this and The Medium doesnt do anything groundbreaking or better than games from the ps1 Era.@Lightning_FF13 Well Yes but actually no.Yes it is technically OKNo because people when they see a game get reviewed 5/10 will consider it trash and never buy it (except if they were extremely hyped for it).P.s: I personally won't buy a 5/10 game not because I consider it trash but because I don't have a lot of time for gaming, so when I do I want to fill that time with the very best games.@misak192 each to their own but I thought it was an average at best 6/10. If you like the gameplay and horror maybe a 7 if you don’t maybe a 5. I didn’t enjoy it much after the great start, but it’s good to see some did.@naruball Why lol? I'm just ranting about a videogame.I will probably play this game. Not expecting too much from what I've seen. But I'll still play it.@Voltan From what I have seen of one comparison video on YouTube, the PS5 version doesn't use ray-traced reflections so it's dynamic resolution doesn't dip as low as the Series X (Series S didn't use RT, either).Anisotropic filtering is better on PS5.Load times are better on Series X|S (2x as fast, actually), but that small window of texture pop-in after load that occurs on Series X|S is eliminated on PS5.PS5 also has slightly a more stutter than Xbox.Lighting, shadows, and ambient occlusion have been reworked on PS5 (sometimes for the better, sometimes with no change, and sometimes not so much so).On topic, with all the mention of Silent Hill, I am surprise there was no mention of Akira Yamaoka's contribution to the soundtrack. I am glad this reviewer enjoyed the game. I do think this game is kind of a love it or hate it kind of game. I really enjoyed it!I tried to like this game. Just controls like a tank. Reminded me of old RE games and not in a good wayEnjoyed it. World is great. But the game is not for everyone.What is the core gameplay? How does it lean on its inspiration and how does it innovate to break away?It's a great game but don't ask me why..8/10I did not jell with it, I found the slow movement and fixed camera things best left in the past. Only played for an hour so can't say much about the story really. I think this is one that will split the audience and that seems clear from the comments above.@naruball I'd say he is pretty generous by calling it mediocre trash. This game is nothing but a walking simulator and it's an insult to mediocre trash.I would not even play this if someone had a gun to my head.@Futureshark As an American who frequents this site i sometimes forget this site is British until one of you references a celebrity that i have to googleI think I'll wait for a sale, I'm more excited about Tormented Souls at the moment. The game seems to be getting a very negative reaction here, to me its just a game that is certainly not for everyone. I've played and enjoyed all Bloober games, but tbh they've all had their frustrating elements. I like slow movement and tank controls for this type of game, but totally understand why people don't, it doesn't make it a bad game.@Voltan here you go..https://wccftech-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/wccftech.com/the-medium-ps5-xsx-comparison/amp/?amp_js_v=a6&amp_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQIKAGwASCAAgM%3D#aoh=16305870294022&csi=0&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwccftech.com%2Fthe-medium-ps5-xsx-comparison%2FA lil lengthy, but whatcha gonna doI was interested in playing this game, if just for the dual realities gimmick; but from all reviews that gimmick is used so poorly that may as well not exist.Is there anyone here that has played it that thinks otherwise? Or is the dual realities gimmick that forgettable?@thedevilsjester I liked the dual-realities thing not so much from a gameplay perspective (though it is different), but more from an artistic perspective: it's a neat way to simulate the awkwardness the main character feels being able to ""exist"" in two planes of reality at the same time.I think it's one thing to watch a video of the mechanic in action and a whole other to actually play the game with the mechanic. It's disorienting in an immersive way. Unfortunately for PlayStation owners, that's not exactly a comfort as it does require purchasing the game to find out if it's something you like.@Futureshark LMAO😂 Yes, please see yourself outPlayed this on XSX.I think the headline says more about the dire state of the PS5's game library than the game itself.This game was not particularly horrifying and just ""ok"" in my view.As an example, I enjoyed Murdered: Soul Suspect far more. A number of parallels between those games and that old title was definitely more engaging.they must have been playing a different game to me because i found medium to be incredibly boring and i usually love this type of game.5/10its not like resident evil at all its more like a walking simulatorI can tell the author liked the game but I learned basically nothing from the review. How does it play? What's it like? I have no idea.@PhhhCough Oof. After reading that, the game sounds like a massive downgrade from the XBSX versionI still plan on waiting until this is $20, game is too short and not a fan of the developer.Really 8 out of 10? Played this on the series x as a game pass release. Really clunky, poor graphics and not scary at all. Feels like a 1997 game..@lolwhatno those are wrong, too. Mediocre, by definition, is not trash.When you become so negative that you consider something mediocre as trash, then you clearly need to work on yourself and see how you got there.@GigaGaia there is no such thing as ""mediocre trash"", but keep on hating it, while ignoring that so many others who have actually played it enjoyed it. If it's not your cup of tea, that's fair enough. That doesn't make it trash.""I would not even play this if someone had a gun to my head""Tell me there's something wrong with you without telling me there's something wrong with you.@naruball By definition it's not, but for the public (you can't deny it, everyone considers a 5/10 game trash) it is.@alex625x sounds familiar. People are raving about recently released Tormented Souls aren’t they? It’s just the true style of this sort of genre, albeit that one looks like a cartoon to me where this looks very good. Expensive night’s gaming regardless …. screams Halloween sale; I’ll wait it outIt looks like a good game but my biggest issue here is why not release it a little later with some finetuning. These days its release and finish later such a pity. But calling a game trash because its a 5/10 game is nonsense. This sounds like a game that needed more time in the oven that needed some finetuning before release si h a pity.Higher score than I expected, looking forward to trying the game, picked up a copy today. Been interested in it since it was announced for Series X last year.Shouldn’t one of the best horror games have more than a mini-reviewvI'd say skip this one if you're on the fence. It's not awful, but it's simply not worth your time. 5/10 Tap here to load 49 commentsLeave A CommentHold on there, you need to login to post a comment...32 Games Will Be Taken Off PS Plus Extra, Premium Next MonthSpider-Man, Resident Evil included16 Games Hit PS Plus Extra, Premium Next WeekBig April 2023 game refresh revealedNaughty Dog Gives PS5 Some Love in New The Last of Us: Part I PatchAdds new HBO contentPoll: Are You Happy with Your PS Plus Extra, Premium Games for April 2023?It was all BethesdaNew PS5 Games Release Dates in 2023All 2023's upcoming PlayStation 5 launch datesGame ProfileTitle:The MediumSystem:PlayStation 5Also Available For:Xbox Series X|SPublisher:Bloober TeamDeveloper:Bloober TeamGenre:AdventurePlayers:1Release Date:PlayStation 5PlayStation Plus Extra (Subscription)Official Site:themediumgame.comWikipedia:en.wikipedia.orgWhere to buy:Buy on Amazon

The Medium,Jason Rodriguez,PC Invasion,https://www.pcinvasion.com/the-medium-review-pc/,"Developer Bloober Team has been known for crafting horror thrillers. We’ve seen the likes of Observer (and Observer: System Redux), Blair Witch, and the Layers of Fear games. Now, the studio is releasing its most ambitious project yet: The Medium.The Medium places you in the role of Marianne, a woman who’s able to communicate with the dead. However, this isn’t just some hullabaloo hoax that you see in a number of morning shows. Indeed, Marianne holds great power, but there’s more than meets the eye. From a young age, Marianne has been experiencing a recurring nightmare, that of a little girl being shot by an unknown man. Marianne has no idea who these people are, and yet it’s through this vision and many others that her powers awaken. This bit of exposition sets the stage for The Medium‘s story, and, fairly early on, you get to experience Marianne’s abilities as she guides a spirit to the afterlife.The narrative moves forward, and Marianne finds herself in Niwa Resort, a facility for workers when Poland was still under Soviet rule. It’s the site of an unspeakable tragedy, haunted by malevolent spirits and echoes of the past. However, all hope is not lost. Marianne must find a way to solve the mystery, and, perhaps, learn about the true nature of her powers as well.There’s no denying that The Medium is truly Bloober Team’s most ambitious project yet thanks to the highly touted dual-reality gameplay. Marianne isn’t just able to check for clues in the material world, but she can also investigate parts of the spirit world.This alternate plane exists alongside the real world, albeit designed in grotesque and macabre ways. You’ll see sites littered with bones, walls made of rotting flesh, eerie lights in the distance, and hungry moths that can chew through your character. It’s equal parts surreal and frightening. Likewise, this feature is present as you hear echoes of past events, see luminescent butterflies and footprints, and notice hidden objects with your insight.It doesn’t stop here, though, because The Medium contains several moments where Marianne experiences “the split.” When this occurs, the dual-reality gameplay kicks in, one where you can control Marianne in both worlds. You can have an out-of-body experience, allowing your character to reach new areas. Moreover, you can charge Marianne’s spirit-based abilities and and examine mirrors that let your character teleport to the spirit realm when needed.The mechanic itself isn’t just a gimmick used to solve puzzles. Rather, it’s also something that adds to the cinematic experience, engrossing narrative, and emotional impact of various scenes. Without going into spoiler territory, let’s just say that Marianne’s interactions in the spirit world are visibly seen in her own reactions in the material world (and vice versa).Given that The Medium is a psychological horror game, you won’t see it littered with many jump scares. Instead, it relies on a foreboding sense of terror given the bleak landscapes, dreary atmosphere, and alarming visuals of the spirit world. It manages to succeed the same way that other offerings such as Little Hope and Amnesia: Rebirth did.My only gripe, though, is regarding a particular entity that hounds you from time to time. For lack of a better term, this entity might be monstrous, but it isn’t scary at all. Although there were instances when I might’ve felt the thrill of the chase, most other encounters had me giggling due to how easy it was to escape.From a graphical standpoint, The Medium‘s visuals are excellent. The creepy locales and horrifying designs will pull you right in, immersing you in its dark world. As cited in our technical review, the game performed admirably. With an Nvidia RTX 3080, I was able to play at 4K UHD resolution on the highest settings while netting 60 FPS consistently during regular gameplay moments. Of course, the framerates would drop down to 50 FPS once dual-reality gameplay occurs. With ray tracing set to ultra, though, I’d get roughly 35-45 FPS and 30-40 FPS respectively.Speaking of ray tracing, this option is only available if you launch The Medium with DX12 selected. However, I would advise you not to do that. In my experience, DX12 caused stuttering and slowdowns whenever you checked notes and clues. As with most horror games, these items are everywhere, and you wouldn’t want to experience these performance issues throughout your run. Furthermore, there were instances when controls felt a little clunky and your character moved too slowly. There were also a handful of cases when the game has no audio upon launching it. Loading a save and pausing seems to fix this problem.The Medium‘s dual-reality gameplay is really something to behold. It succeeds not just as a means of searching for clues or solving puzzles, but also as a storytelling device. The feature is a surprisingly refreshing twist to a genre that we’ve gotten used to.As for the story, The Medium‘s narrative is suspenseful and dark. There are some disturbing themes and scenes that may shock and unnerve you, though it can feel a bit disconnected at times. Unfortunately, this roughly seven-hour journey fell flat towards the end. Again, without spoiling anything, let’s just say that the ending came abruptly and without any resolution. I don’t know if I’m supposed to find more collectibles to discover an entirely different ending or if this is what the developers planned. However, I do know that I wasn’t even prompted to make a choice. Like Marianne’s journey, The Medium‘s conclusion was truly bizarre.Although it has demanding system requirements, The Medium is still a marvelous offering when it comes to its visuals and gameplay. Its locations will haunt and horrify you, and its dual-reality system will provide refreshing ways to complete your objectives. Unfortunately, it also suffers from a few technical hiccups, and its bizarrely abrupt conclusion leaves a lot to be desired.About Us

The Medium,Paul Sullivan,COGconnected,https://cogconnected.com/review/the-medium-review/,"What lies beyond? It’s a question that’s dominated the human psyche since the dawn of consciousness. What beyond that ridge? That horizon? Or the ultimate, most unanswerable question of all: what lies beyond this mortal plane? What happens when we pass on?Without answers, hints, or even the faintest notion of an inkling, it’s unsurprising that so much time and effort has been devoted to media exploring death. The entire horror genre and most thrillers directly rely on death as a story element, and games are no different. Resident Evil and Silent Hill started the ball rolling decades ago, and the trend holds up today.The fascination around death is so deeply ingrained that almost any angle or approach has instant credibility, and as such Bloober Team’s latest creation The Medium immediately captivated the market when it was revealed. Featuring a mysterious world splitting mechanic, The Medium was set to be one of the Xbox Series X’s showpieces at launch. Release slipped to January, but would that be a bad omen for the fate of the experience?**Very light story spoilers follow**The Medium stars Marianne, a Polish woman who we quickly learn is in the process of burying her adoptive father, Jack. She’s a mystery to us, and either by choice or a lack of knowledge she reveals little about herself right away. Except for one key point: she sees dead people. Walking around, like regular people.Marianne is a medium, and she’s able to help those who have passed move on to the next plane of existence by interacting with the departed in a sort of spirit realm. It’s a great setup for a mystery, and of course, Marianne quickly receives a call from a man she doesn’t recognize. He seems to know her, and he needs her help. For a reason she seems to not understand, she sets off to Niwa Resort to investigate. While it drags in the early going, the adventure that follows covers a lot of ground. Using Marianne’s powers liberally, that slow burn warms up as it carries on. It goes places I expected, places I didn’t, and ultimately tells a story I wanted to see through.The Medium relies heavily on the environments it places characters in to provide context to the story, and it’s really well done. Being set in Poland, there’s a ton of history to lean on, and lean it does. Bits of story are strewn around the levels, told either directly through flashback audio, or implied via set dressing. It’s largely intriguing, and I wanted more. I found myself eyeballs deep in various aspects of Polish history after a number of play sessions, and I commend Bloober Team for bravely setting The Medium in their home country. To me, offering outsiders a platform to dive into Polish history from is The Medium’s biggest success. I found myself really wanting to zoom in and take a close look at Niwa, though first person camera control is sadly limited to select spots. Troy Baker grabs the headlines in just about everything he’s in (and he’s in literally everything at this point, I think), but he ends up being a tiny piece of an overall successful voice cast. Character actors you’ll recognize from one game or another but struggle to name turn in some truly creepy line reads throughout the adventure.Is it scary, though? No, not really. I’m not one to fall for jump scares that easily, and thankfully The Medium avoids using that crutch too often. It finds more success creating psychological tension, though I never found myself physically dreading entering the next room. Imprints from the past build up a desire to know what happened, but the often creepy voiceover rarely receives much visual support.  It was definitely trying to scare me at times, but never quite found that delicate balance. That has a lot to do with the way The Medium is paced. It’s… off. Effective thrillers, mysteries, and scary content deftly balance the audience on a knife edge. Tension ought to be kept consistently high, with brief reprieves that only provide the most fleeting exhale. The Medium has moments that I absolutely loved from both visual and storytelling perspectives, but they were too far apart to feel like I needed a metaphorical safety blanket nearby. Gameplay segments guiding Marianne from A to B or working to retrieve a tool are perhaps expected in an experience like this, but the let-offs were too drawn out. Long exploration sections show off the environments well, but somehow also made me feel too safe.In tense scenarios, I was far too able to intuit when danger had passed. I’ve been desperately scouring my notes, trying to figure out why.The only notion I came up with is that The Medium feels like it’s from the same era as Silent Hill. You know, the era where scripting triggers were blatantly obvious and monsters definitely couldn’t open that door. Perhaps that was an intentional choice, but too many of the mechanical pieces were detractors from the experience. Marianne is slower than a turtle in molasses, and while the generally fixed camera angles are certainly cinematic, they result in far too many movement hiccups when the angle shifts. For my money, the story and environment is absolutely the reason to play The Medium, and if they’d shaved off a good half of the gameplay this would be a tenser, tighter, and more satisfying story.The Medium’s much talked about world splitting mechanic defines a good deal of the visual and audio presentation. In those sections, the game renders the physical and ethereal world simultaneously. Yeah, two worlds. Marianne moves through both worlds in lock step, while physical features and interactable points vary. It’s a simple system, but it’s a proof of concept for a gameplay mode that’s been near impossible prior to this hardware generation. The desolate spirit world has wasteland written all over it, its masked characters taking on a quality not unlike crumbling clay. Meanwhile, the physical world is infinitely more complex. The soundscape matches the visual presentation the whole way, leaving no mistake which world you’re currently in.The game looks excellent, with great art direction across the board. The lighting stood out particularly to me, showcasing really impressive bounce lighting from Marianne’s flashlight while tiles and wood floors look remarkably like real surfaces. The ray traced reflections look great when they stand out, and add a ton to the atmosphere even when they’re less conspicuous. Sadly, In sections featuring a split world, resolution takes quite a noticeable hit. Reflections are more pixelated, and the image as whole is far less sharp. Other times, the scene would hitch badly when entering a cutscene, or textures would fail to load in. It’s far from unheard of course, but still disappointing given I was playing on the self proclaimed world’s most powerful console ever.As a whole package The Medium is very much a story of compromise. For all its successes in visual storytelling and interesting setting, it’s collared by poor pacing and dated game design. Still, it’s well worth a look for history buffs and those fascinated by the unknown. So what lies beyond? It’s still up for debate. In the present, The Medium offers an intriguing possibility to puzzle on. *Xbox Series X review code provided by the Publisher*Developer: Bloober TeamPublisher: Bloober Team SA"
The Medium,Kai Powell,Wccftech,https://wccftech.com/review/the-medium-silence-of-the-damned/,"With Silent Hill existing only in modern Pachinko machines or as trivia questions at a Geeks Who Drink event, Konami's signature horror series hasn't seen many derivative works in recent years compared to other horror staples. That's why I was rather curious when Bloober Team, a studio known for Layers of Fear, Observer, and other first-person titles, expressed interest in exploring a third-person horror game. Not only that, but they would try and one-up Team Silent by introducing a world where the physical and hell planes exist not only in the same universe but could be explored simultaneously. As a next-generation Xbox (and PC) exclusive, Bloober Team's first crack at that deep psychological horror is The Medium, a fitting name for one that can commune with the dead.As The Medium of the game's namesake, Marianne has a unique ability to send away the souls of those left with a lingering attraction to the mortal realm, starting with the stand-in father figure that runs a funeral home, a rather fitting line of work for someone that can commune with the dead. By knowing their true name and severing that lingering attachment to this mortal coil, Marianne can set those wandering souls free. This role of hers pops up quite frequently during her visit to not-so-sunny Niwa as those beings of resentment often bar Marianne from progressing onwards until she can set them free.Unlike Bloober Team's majority of previous works, Marianne won't be venturing off into Niwa in first-person. Instead, The Medium relies on a more contemporary scheme to tell its tale, focusing on the third-person camera angles of early Resident Evil and Silent Hill games. Pre-determined camera angles help to focus the gameplay and draw the player's attention to objects of interest throughout the confined environments. The usual issues of wonky scene transitions are still as much a part of The Medium as they were in Silent Hill but I found that the camera angles were usually pretty generous when it came to showing more of the scene at a given time.Marianne isn't much of a fighter and you won't find her using that otherworldly straight razor to fend off vengeful spirits. Instead, her powers as a medium are used for more defensive or strategic purposes in the spirit realm. Fueled by conveniently placed spirit wells that draw from the energy of objects that still hold an attachment to the mortal realm. Routinely, just stumbling upon an object of great importance isn't enough to draw its power; Marianne instead must traverse the physical realm to find other objects and combine them together, such as returning a missing children's toy to its rightful place, before her spirit side can utilize its power. Once charged, Marianne can either use that spirit energy for an outward spirit blast (again, non-attacking) to charge up unpowered generators or circuit breakers or, more commonly, place a spiritual shield around herself that allows her to walk unimpeded through assaulting barrages of spirit moths.Much of the key items and inventory additions that Marianne sticks in her back pocket will be used throughout much of the six-hour playthrough. It's refreshing to finally have a survival horror game where the protagonist doesn't immediately throw out their set of bolt cutters after carving through one or two chained doorways. After going through the excessive puzzle that crops up in every survival horror game to unlock one of these tools, Marianne keeps those tools with her the whole way through. The first time you try to use these tools on a locked gate or fleshy wall, you have to go through a banal minigame of squeezing both triggers to mimic using the bolt cutters or draw a line downwards through meat seams with the analog stick. Unfortunately, this same minigame crops up not once, not twice, but every single time you run across a similar impediment. The mechanic wasn't fun the first time and it doesn't get any better five hours later.The Medium otherwise follows the typical tropes of what most survival horror games touch upon as a gallery of locked doors and one-way progression. Despite taking place in a grand, yet overrun, hotel in beautiful Niwa, Bloober Team has found a way to continue corralling the player into a nearly straight line throughout their adventure. Most areas will only be visited by a player once in either (or both) realms but it's otherwise a relatively straight path through the narrative from beginning to end. There are a small number of side diversions to collect postcards and other physical pieces of lore strewn throughout the less likely paths of Niwa but don't expect a great deal of backtracking and exploration along the way. Of course, there are a few exceptions to the rule, and Bloober Team sought fit to put the focus on a couple of important areas in the adventure that punctuate key turning points in the narrative.Part of what made Silent Hill such a memorable horror game was the use of dual realities that guide the player through both the real world and a world of delusions and strife, but these were always separate from one other (save for some beings that could traverse between them beyond the player). The Medium bridges the two realms together by granting Marianne the ability to not only jump back and forth between these two worlds but to co-exist in them simultaneously. However, this isn't an ability that the player has free reign to explore at any time they want. Much of the time is spent in the real, dilapidated world while delving into the Spirit World to unblock a path or power on a circuit breaker only happens at key instances throughout Marianne's story. It isn't until midway through the adventure that the player can come across a pair of cat figurines that allow Marianne to freely traverse between the two realms when she discovers an unbroken mirror.One of the big unique hooks to The Medium lies in Marianne's ability to exist in both realms at once, switching the perspective to a split-screen reality as the player controls both instances of her at once. As interesting as the meat-filled Spirit World can be, there's not much reason to explore and have a gander at the grotesque scenery. I spent much of the time wandering about, bumping into every object I could see in hopes of getting the nice big button prompt to interact and either unlock a path for the other reality or some hidden collectible. In a lot of ways, I'm reminded of Bloober Team's first Layers of Fear title. There's a lot of interesting window dressing to the world in either reality, but with how much you're constantly just running to the next checkpoint or safe harbor, there isn't much time to explore and take in the ambiance. If anything, The Medium winds up feeling like the first draft of something much more ambitious.The Medium is a good return to form for the survival horror genre that's split in such wild directions, from the first person Allison Road/P.T. at one end and the creature sneakers that either overload the player with firepower or strip it all away to force them to hide from a greater threat. The Medium takes a different path altogether, instead trying to invoke the split realities of Silent Hill and rely on those feelings of longing and desire for something new from Team Silent. While Bloober Team misses that crucial spark that made the Silent Hill titles so brilliant in the first place, their first draft of horror should spook and delight fans of the genre.Reviewed on Xbox Series X (code provided by the publisher).Marianne might be able to jump between two realities, but The Medium is trapped somewhere between being a worthy Silent Hill successor and another mediocre hide and seek horror game.Subscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox© 2023 WCCF TECH INC.

The Medium exists in two worlds. Yes, the game often shifts between the real world and the spiritual realm, but it’s also an enthralling cinematic experience oft hampered by a clumsy game. Like protagonist Marianne simultaneously present in both worlds, The Medium itself exists in both of these places, a fractured identity. The jarring shifts between cinematic narrative horror experience and those inelegant gameplay moments don’t outright ruin the game, but they do present some stumbling blocks along the way.The Medium tells the story of Marianne, a woman deeply connected with the spirit world since her childhood. After receiving a mysterious phone call from someone claiming to know what she can do, she travels to the Niwa Resort, an abandoned place with a dark history that she may find some deeper connections with. At Niwa, Marianne meets the spirit of a child named Sadness as she tries to unravel the mystery of who called her, why, and what part she plays in this grander story.At its outset, The Medium reminded me a lot of a game like Heavy Rain or Until Dawn. Cinematic camera angles, deliberate actions as you search the environment for story tidbits and ways to move forward. And once the game introduces the shifts into the spirit world, it really starts to remind one of Silent Hill, a clear influence for Bloober Team on this project. In fact, it’s enough to be considered a spiritual successor to the Silent Hill franchise, in just about everything but the name. Story is told through persistent narration, as well as comments Marianne makes about the world and situation around her. There are some other fun surprises in how the story is laid out too, and this clever interweaving kept me engaged throughout.The only area the story really falters in is simply rolling through too many generally predictable horror game tropes. Each subsequent beat generally won’t surprise the player if they’re familiar with how horror developers often draw parallels between psychological trauma and otherworldly horror. At times it can tread through the topic of psychological traumas with all the grace of a bull in tap shoes (one sequence borders on expressing a sympathy/justification for an abuser based on their own trauma before thankfully steering clear), but it’s generally an interesting and enjoyable, if largely rote, horror narrative.The biggest unique thing that The Medium does is to not just shift between worlds, but allow Marianne to exist in both simultaneously. This allows for some very interesting cutscenes—watching spirits interact with objects in the spirit world and how that affects them in the real world—and makes for some intriguing and engaging puzzles. The screen will split to show two views of the same location. You’ll need to keep an eye on both for objects to interact with, passages to traverse, and other clues that can help you move forward and navigate the world and its mysteries.There are times where there are dedicated shifts, you’ll be in either one or the other world, but especially impressive are those moments you are pulled into both at once. Overall, The Medium paces out these shifts rather well. I never felt like it was overly reliant on the real world, the spirit world, or even the split world moments, and the variety of environments keeps changing to make exploration never slog. Funny enough, in one sequence where I did feel like things were getting to be a bit repetitive slog, the character made a comment relating to that exact thing, something along the lines of “this again…?” so there was definitely a sense of self awareness anytime the pacing did start to drag.Horror elements in The Medium are mostly relegated to unnerving tension. There are a couple of small jump scares here and there, but for the most part, The Medium just wants to creep you out with the sense that the spirit world is right there, waiting, just on the other side. But it inevitably runs into what is effectively the same issue with almost every horror game: how do you balance tension and gameplay? And it’s here that The Medium starts to stumble. While I loved exploring the dilapidated Niwa Resort and the game’s variety of environments in both the real world and the spirit world, coming across discarded remnants of its residents’ past traumas and horrors, I wasn’t exactly thrilled anytime I’d be put into encounters with The Medium’s looming threat: the mysterious creature known as The Maw.The Maw is The Medium’s version of Mister X/Tyrant, Nemesis, Lady Dimetrescu, or Pyramid Head. A persistent threat that will pop up at inopportune moments and chase the player down, you don’t have a lot of recourse to combat The Maw. Marianne has the ability to absorb energy in the spirit world, which she can then use for a few different powers, like generating a shield around herself or sending out a blast. If she has energy, she can survive being grabbed by The Maw once, but often you need that energy elsewhere for a puzzle. And that’s only in the spirit world. The Maw can travel to the real world too, not to mention it’s invisible in that space, and Marianne is powerless there.This means that there’s a lot of trial and error to escaping and outmaneuvering The Maw, with multiple frustrating deaths, lengthy reloads (for a PS5 game), and attempting the sequence all over again. These forced encounters with poor stealth mechanics feel completely at odds with the rest of the cinematic narrative centered game, suddenly making the player painfully aware that they are playing a game. And forget the tension. Even one failure against The Maw’s obnoxiously frustrating power is enough to take the cinematic horror tension and replace it with the cumbersome need to get past a generally unforgiving gameplay segment.Aside from these moments, the journey through The Medium was generally intriguing, if fairly linear overall. A few side paths hold additional collectibles or items that lend some additional backstory, but for the most part, players should be able to go straight through this horror adventure with few detours, which generally keeps that pacing feeling good.The Ps5 version of The Medium boasts some interesting use of the DualSense controller, using haptic feedback to communicate things within the spirit world, and adaptive triggers that give a bit of resistance for certain actions. It’s definitely not to the level that we see some first-party PS5 games use the controller, but it’s an overall admirable effort for a game that was ultimately a port from Xbox. The speaker also allows for some rather ghostly interactions with some of the audio throughout the game, making for a more immersive experience if you aren’t using headphones. However, the headphone audio is superb and probably the recommended way to get fully and truly immersed in the tension and terror that comes with being able to see the other side.The Medium is an admirable horror experience from a developer that has been making a lot of huge strides for itself in the world of horror game development. It’s not something that is going to change the world of horror games, but it does enough unique things with the simultaneous dual-world mechanic to stand out. Like many horror games before it, it fails to balance its tension with certain gameplay mechanics that can turn from fear to frustration pretty quickly, but these are spaced out enough that it never ruined the experience wholesale. For any horror fans looking for a Silent Hill-esque game to fill that ominous void, The Medium will at least scratch that itch.The Medium review code provided by publisher. Reviewed on a PS5.

The Medium,Mike Williams,PCMag,https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/the-medium-for-pc,"A horror game that lacks big frightsThe Medium impresses with its next-gen graphics and unique, split-screenplay that lets you jump between the human and spirit worlds. Unfortunately, the horror game's not particularly scary.In a short time span, Polish developer Bloober Team has vastly improved its horror chops. The studio launched the fairly pedestrian haunted house adventure, Layers of Fear, in 2017. The next year, it followed with the sci-fi, psychological horror title, The Observer, then the one-two punch of Layers of Fear 2 and a game based on the Blair Witch films. The Medium is the culmination of that effort and expertise, a horror adventure that aims to sit alongside Silent Hill and other genre classics. Although it doesn’t quite hit that level, the $49.99 PC game provides a distinctly Polish spin on similar concepts. It just needs bigger frights and better PC performance.In The Medium, you play as Marianne, a young woman who has the ability to see spirits and travel to the spirit world. Marianne uses her ability to lay the restless dead to rest, but a mysterious message promising details about her past draws her to an abandoned resort hotel. In short, the Medium runs through the horror-adventure checklist: mysterious past, cryptic dreams, and something drawing our protagonist to a long-dead location. Bloober Team’s previous games were presented in first-person fashion, but The Medium pulls the camera back into a third-person view. Even better, the camera uses fixed viewpoints that harken back to the horror classics like Alone in the Dark, Resident Evil (1996), or Silent Hill. This not only properly places Marianne within the scene—pulling back to show her loneliness or zooming in to capture her more emotional moments—but it also lets the developer focus your viewpoint on the amazing scenery its created.This graphical might also applies to Hotel Niwa, a place where you learn about another facet of Marianne’s power: the ability to exist within the world of the dead. This dead, alien environment is where lost souls wander, a decaying monument to past trauma and lingering despair. The environments are inspired by the art of Polish painter Zdzisław Beksiński, whose work in “fantastic realism” includes vast, desert landscapes and misshapen flesh that's dotted with the bones and pulsing fungi. The Medium sees Bloober Team drawing upon Polish culture and history in the same way CD Projekt Red did with The Witcher series.The story weaves Marianne’s lost past with the incident that made Hotel Niwa fall. Not all questions are answered by the tale's end, but most of the pieces fall into the places you’d expect. There's one story tangent that's a bit uneven, involving a mature subject matter that I didn’t anticipate the game touching. Bloober Team isn’t gratuitous in its handling of this plot point, but I don’t think it came together as well as intended. Thankfully, the rest of the adventure fares a bit better. Marianne interacts with the twin worlds in a many ways. In some cases, she uses mirrors to cross between worlds. In others, supernatural forces violently toss her into either reality. But many times, The Medium displays Marianne in both realities at the same time.With this gameplay technique, Bloober Team showcases its technical chops by rendering two worlds in real time. This split fuels the game's many puzzles; while a route may be closed in one reality, it’s open in the other. As a result, you must hop between worlds to figure out how to move forward. In some cases, Marianne can untether her soul from her body, letting her traverse farther in the spirit world for a limited period of time. The split-screen gameplay is impressive, and it holds an unnatural mirror up to the more common reality. Rendering both worlds at once doesn’t always go off without a hitch, though. Textures slowly load when you open the inventory screen or use mirrors to jump between realities. Furthermore, I noticed a persistent, graphical microstutter while playing the game at a locked 60 frames per second at 1440p resolution. This is an issue that happened less frequently while playing the game at 4K resolution. On the upside, The Medium showcases the power of Nvidia's RTX 30 series cards. The dilapidated hotel looks fantastic, with ray traced lighting cast on piles of dead leaves, skeletal trees, and ruined 1960s architecture. A dual-world presentation is just a gimmick if it’s not used in an interesting fashion. Fortunately, The Medium’s story is one of Bloober Team’s better efforts, but it’s still not an entirely surprising one. Hotel Niwa is filled with grand dreams dashed against the shores of past trauma, something that’s carried onto Marianne herself. I saw many plot twists coming ahead of time; atmosphere carries most of the game.Bloober Team has improved its horror chops within five years, but The Medium still has its fair share of problems. The game is largely a linear affair, with straightforward puzzles—find thing A, use in slot B. Additional exploration and a slightly larger map would better tie you to the location, a la Resident Evil and Resident Evil 2. It would also give you a chance to wonder where a puzzle item should be used. As it stands, you’ll use an item in the same room in which you found it or the next one over. There are dangers to Marianne’s safety, including a malevolent fiend and moth swarms that eat her soul. There are mechanics to deal with them, with Marianne drawing on light in the spirit world to blast away evil or shield herself. In the real world, you can crouch behind cover and hold your breath to make yourself invisible to your pursuer. Unfortunately, there are few sections where you need to keep quiet or shield yourself with the light of good memories to move forward. The game needs more tension, something The Medium’s Japanese counterparts understand. It’s beautiful and haunting, but lacks tension.You’ll need a relatively powerful rig to handle the game's strong graphics. The Medium's minimum system specs call for an AMD Ryzen 5 2500X or Intel CPU Core i5-6600 CPU, AMD Radeon R9 390X or Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 GPU, 8GB of RAM, and 55GB of storage. The game supports Nvidia's RTX and DLSS 2.0 tech. My rig contains an AMD Ryzen 5 3600X CPU, Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 GPU, and 32GB of RAM. Playing the game at 4K resolution, with ray tracing on and DLSS off, caused the frame rate to dance in the 30 frames per second range. The frame rate rose to 60fps after I dropped the resolution to 1440p and turned DLSS on. That said, The Medium is a slower, more methodical PC game, so a 30fps frame rate isn’t a huge issue (outside of the aforementioned microstutter). The Medium is available on PC via Steam, so it has many familiar Steam extras, including Steam Achievements, Steam Cloud, and full controller support.Horror happens when you step across the point of no return. You could die, you could become something else; the fear is in not knowing. The Medium treads upon horror concepts, but it doesn’t fully step across the line. Despite its flaws, it's a game that's worth experiencing for the dual-world mechanics. That said, if you want to experience genuine frights on PC, check out Capcom's excellent Resident Evil series.For more Steam game reviews and previews, check out PCMag's Steam Curator(Opens in a new window) page.  The Medium impresses with its next-gen graphics and unique, split-screenplay that lets you jump between the human and spirit worlds. Unfortunately, the horror game's not particularly scary.Sign up for Lab Report to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

The Medium,Elise Favis,Washington Post,https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/reviews/medium-review/,"This article was published more than 2 years agoWhen the Xbox Series X launched late last year, it came with a limited library of new games, especially after “Halo Infinite” was delayed. “The Medium,” a horror game from the creators of “Observer” and “Blair Witch,” is 2021′s first exclusive for the Series X, but unfortunately it doesn’t make much of a splash.“The Medium” follows Marianne, a young woman grappling with the loss of her recently deceased father. She receives a strange call, kick-starting a bizarre mystery connected to her past and her ghostly medium powers (these allow her to converse and interact with the dead, as well as traverse their hellish world).The voice on the phone tells her to visit an abandoned resort, in which much of the game takes place, to unravel what’s going on. Though I felt invested by the sheer strangeness of the story at first, it later becomes disjointed and lacks direction, much like the gameplay itself.This horror game comes with a unique gameplay mechanic: Occasionally you control two worlds at once, presented as a split-screen. Think of the worlds as two different lenses, or filters: You see the same area on both halves of the screen, but they’re different. One is the living world, and the other is an underworld filled with death, and Marianne walks through both simultaneously. You use both worlds to solve certain puzzles: For example, when searching for items, you’ll notice objects and areas will only appear in one world. Or, certain interactions in one world will make the other change (like unlocking a door), carving a new path forward. The concept has potential, but in execution, it’s under realized with uninspired puzzles. That’s a shame, because without clever use or much significance to the story, the split screen effect come across like a gimmick.I recreated ‘Phasmophobia’ in ‘The Sims 4’ with the game’s new paranormal packNot all the puzzles are boring; one of my favorites involved a dollhouse with small mirrors inside. Swapping mirrors to the different rooms of the dollhouse would open new portals in the real world. It’s too bad that few other puzzles were as interesting; usually they involved picking up items, placing them elsewhere and eventually finding a new way to progress into a previously locked room. Rinse and repeat.Similar to some puzzle moments, several cutscenes split the screen in half to portray two worlds, with Marianne speaking to spirits who appear in one, and are invisible in the other. This makes the experience awkward, mostly — my eyes often darted up and down to both, never quite knowing where to look.It also doesn’t help that the characters are mediocre at best, with only Sadness — a troubled spirit Marianne tries to help throughout her journey — inspiring a small measure of interest as the two gain one another’s trust. Lackluster voice acting in these instances is a major distraction, keeping these interactions from feeling poignant.In terms of horror, “The Medium” has some good scares but they are sandwiched between boring stretches where I mostly just walked through long hallways, or climbed obstacles, feeling lost. It’s easy to get disoriented, especially when you are given little instruction as to where to go.Much of the heavy lifting for frights is done by the environments, especially in the world of the dead that takes a Lovecraftian aesthetic, with slippery tentacles or long arms reaching down from above. One of my favorite levels involved a glowing red backdrop in a distorted world made of office supplies and imagery from a slaughter house. The sound design, like the disturbing sound of a blade cutting through flesh, is equally excellent. While “The Medium” is clearly spooky through its ambiance, it’s unfortunate that it never builds upon those environments with effective scares.The few moments where I did feel terrified were during chase sequences. Occasionally you come across a terrifying, gargoyle-like beast who can turn invisible at a moment’s notice, and I gripped the controller tight when he was hot on my trail. In other occasions you use stealth to get past him safely: you can press a button so Marianne holds her breath, making her less detectable, as well as crouch or take cover as you move away. Although I’d initially feel terrified when the monster appeared for stealth sections, my fear would soon dissipate, as I’d always leave these encounters unharmed. They were too easy; the enemy A.I. called The Maw rarely found me — because he’s blind — but even when making a sound, I could easily recover. The lack of challenge lowered the intensity of these moments.“The Medium” is uninspired, from puzzles to characters. If you’re looking for an interesting world to explore, it delivers with stunning art direction, but for those looking for a richer experience, “The Medium” feels skin deep.Read more:‘Hitman 3’ is the grandest stage for your own stories, even as it tries to end its ownI’ve owned all 3 next-generation consoles for 2 months.

The Medium,Christopher Byrd,Washington Post,https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2021/01/28/medium-real-world-spirit-world-split-this-unusually-dynamic-adventure/,"This article was published more than 2 years agoThe MediumDeveloped by: Bloober TeamPublished by: Bloober TeamAvailable on: PC, Xbox Series X/SA cliche can supercharge a story if it opens the door for its own subversion. That was my thought when I finished “The Medium,” a game which begins with a woman uttering the portentous words, “It all starts with a dead girl,” as she describes a recurring dream she has had since childhood. In it, a man chases a girl through a wooded area to a pier where he shoots her with a pistol. The first time I watched the scene play out, I thought of other stories that revolve around dead girls: “Twin Peaks,” “The Virgin Suicides,” the two “True Detective” seasons worth watching, etc., not to mention the articles I’ve glanced at that have examined the trope in YA fiction. Skeptical of such a setup, I was gratified to see how the tale of the murdered dream girl ends up running aground on the shore of reality.Set in Krakow in 1999, “The Medium” tells the story of Marianne, a woman who can communicate with spirits and travel between the lands of the living and the dead. We are introduced to her during a low point in her life — on the day she visits the funeral home which, until recently, was owned by her beloved foster father Jack. She is there to pin a tie on his corpse. But just as she completes her task in the mortuary, the lights in the room start flickering. Tracking the disturbance upstairs, Marianne hears the door of Jack’s office shut and a sharp sound ring out from inside. Stepping into the office, she finds shards of pottery scattered on the floor, and her reality splits in two.On the left side of the screen is the Marianne we’ve been following to this point; on the right, in a twilit world, is Marianne’s spirit self. On one side, we see a brunette-haired Marianne talking to herself in Jack’s office while on the other we see a white-haired Marianne addressing Jack’s spirit, sporting a marble death mask, as he frantically searches for a notebook. Shaken, but self-possessed, Marianne helps Jack to understand that the notebook he is looking for is unimportant and it’s all right for him to pass over to the other side.Following Jack’s departure Marianne finds herself whole again and in his old office when the phone rings. Upon answering she is greeted by an unknown man. Radiating tension, he introduces himself as Thomas and tells her that he knows about the dream that has plagued her throughout her life. At a loss for time, he entreats her to meet him at the Niwa Resort where he promises answers to her questions.Heeding her instincts, Marianne decides to go to the Niwa, an abandoned, government-run resort intended to showcase the triumphs of twentieth-century communism — a workers’ playground if you will. As she approaches the building she is unsettled by its aura. Her subsequent exploration of it, as well as its vast underground structure, uncovers a tangled history — e.g. parts of the facility were once used by the Nazis.As players explore the Niwa and its environs, Marianne’s reality will fracture when she comes across areas haunted by traumatized spirits she can help, or a malignant spirit who means her harm. During these moments, players will have to pay attention to both the material and the spirit world to solve puzzles or escape from danger, as different clues appear in each. In the spirit world, Marianne can draw energy from departed souls which she can use to cloak herself in a shield to ward off flying adversaries known as spirit moths. She can also use a “spirit blast” to defend herself against a more formidable enemy whose identity isn’t revealed until late in the game.Things affected in one world have repercussions in the other. Often, real-world Marianne will come across devices that lack electrical power. To remedy such issues she’ll have to hunt around for the spirit-world counterpart to, say, an elevator or a fuse box which can be activated with a spirit blast. Moreover, while straddling both worlds, Marianne will sometimes come across a passageway that is blocked in the material world but unobstructed in the spirit world. With the press of a button, she can leave her material incarnation to explore areas that are otherwise cut off from her real-world self. I loved the way these mechanics worked together to create an unusually dynamic adventure.The real strength of “The Medium” is the novel way it uses split-screen gameplay to tell a single-player story. Numerous video games have used split-screens for multiplayer in the past, but “The Medium” is the first one I know of which extensively uses the technique for a single-player tale. Scenes are split along vertical and horizontal axes and it's not unusual for the separate halves to focus on different facets of their corresponding environments. As a result, “The Medium” is a game with a rich visual vocabulary. This style reinforces the idea that the game can be read as a parable for a land soaked in history. After all, anyone who has walked through an old city has probably entertained thoughts of what it was like to pass through the area in bygone days and Marianne is a vessel for a past that refuses to stay mum.Although “The Medium” is billed as a psychological horror game, I found it to be consistently unsettling rather than scary. There is a vengeful monster that Marianne must deal with intermittently, but except for one breathtaking scene where he chases her through different realities — resulting in shifts in perspective that strike like tidal waves — I didn’t think much of him. Nothing robs a creepy game of its power as forcing a player to confront the same monster too many times so, thankfully, the monster encounters are nicely spread out. “The Medium” might not have the most nightmarish adversary but its blanketing, foreboding atmosphere and uncompromising ending amply makes up for it.Christopher Byrd is a Brooklyn-based writer.
