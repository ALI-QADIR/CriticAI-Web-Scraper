Link Official site (opens in new tab)Death Stranding is best when it shuts up. Being a game by Metal Gear Solid creator Hideo Kojima, it's naturally filled with bizarre characters, lengthy screeds of exposition, and indulgent cutscenes. But it's in the long, quiet stretches between all this, when it's just you hiking alone across a stark, haunting post-apocalyptic wilderness, where it really shines. In these moments, Death Stranding is quite unlike anything I've ever experienced in a game—or any other medium for that matter.That's not to say there's no value in the plot. When you're not being bombarded with mind-bending backstory, it's pretty interesting—and deeply weird. You are Sam Porter Bridges (played with a strange charisma by The Walking Dead's Norman Reedus), a courier delivering cargo across what's left of the United States. A supernatural cataclysm called the Death Stranding has driven the last of humanity into underground cities, leaving the barren, windswept surface plagued by soul-sucking ghosts called BTs, rain that rapidly ages anything it touches, and other strangeness.Watch our video review above.Your mission is to hike across North America, from the east coast to the west, connecting scattered settlements to the Chiral Network—a spiritual successor to the internet—as you go. Why Sam, though? He's a talented porter with a rep for getting things delivered on time. But, more importantly, he can detect BTs—which are otherwise invisible—with the help of a tiny, creepy baby strapped to his chest. One character insists these so-called Bridge Babies are merely equipment, not people, but Sam can't help but form a bond with the eerie infant. Oh, and Sam is immortal too, which makes him the perfect candidate for, as his superiors not-so-subtly put it, making America whole again.The majority of your time in Death Stranding is spent out in the open, plodding slowly from one place to another. The game is essentially a feature-length fetch quest. But the environment, and the many challenges it throws at you, makes these trips worth enduring. This curiously Scandinavian landscape is serenely beautiful, with a grand sense of scale and a bewitching atmosphere. As I trek across the continent I see enormous, cascading waterfalls, snowy mountains, steam-spewing volcanic fissures, raging rivers, dense forests, and wide, grassy plains—and it all looks, and sounds, stunning.I played Death Stranding on a PC with an RTX 2080 Super, an Intel Core i7-9700K, and 16GB of RAM, and it ran great at 4K/60fps—especially with DLSS 2.0 (opens in new tab) enabled. As for PC features, there's a set of Valve-themed side missions that unlock Half-Life cosmetics. As you'd expect, Death Stranding looks its best on PC, and solid performance, ultrawide support, and a new harder difficulty mode round the package off nicely.But it's not just for show. Death Stranding is secretly a brilliant hiking and mountaineering simulator, and every piece of rough terrain you encounter is a puzzle to be solved. If you rush things, Sam can trip, stagger, lose his balance, get swept away by powerful rivers, or slide down steep inclines—losing or damaging cargo in the process. This forces you to slow down and take a more thoughtful approach. Carefully plotting and picking your way across this rugged, unpredictable topography without dropping the precarious stack of packages balanced on your back is challenging and laborious, but also immensely rewarding.Some jobs seem impossible. Standing at the foot of a mountain, snow whipping at its peaks, fragile cargo stuck to every inch of your suit, you wonder how you'll ever get over it. But you power on, one step at a time, patiently placing ladders and climbing ropes, edging closer to your destination. Along the way you might have to slip into Metal Gear mode and sneak past BTs, or deal with extreme weather such as disorientating blizzards. You might even get knocked out by terrorists and have your cargo stolen, forcing you to sneak into their camp and take it back. But after all that, you make it, and it feels incredible.If this sounds like a lot of hard work, well, it is. But one of my favourite things about Death Stranding is how it drip-feeds you new gadgets and tools to gradually make things easier. As you progress through the story you unlock an almost overwhelming array of kit, including power gloves for faster climbing, BT-killing blood grenades (don't ask), and mechanical exo-skeletons that let you handle more weight, tackle tougher terrain, or run faster. You even get access to vehicles, including an electric trike. However, you can only carry so much stuff at once, so there's a nice strategic element to deciding which gear to take or leave before you embark on a long delivery.But you're never alone out there. Death Stranding's most overt theme is connection, and this manifests itself in some brilliantly clever asynchronous multiplayer. As players traverse their world, dropping ladders and ropes, or using a device called a PCC to build river-spanning bridges, battery-boosting generators, ziplines, roads, and other helpful objects, these then appear in other people's games. You see traces of other porters everywhere you go, and there's something wonderful about struggling up a mountain, only to spot a rope left by a fellow traveller, which then spares you a chunk of climbing. And you can show your appreciation with likes, a kind of social XP.Sneaking through terrorist camps, the DNA of Metal Gear Solid is strongly feltYou unlock weapons later in the game, both lethal and non-lethal, but I was impressed by how I was able to play the bulk of Death Stranding without using them at all—outside of a few unavoidable set-pieces. There are dozens of ways to deal with BTs and terrorists, but there's always the option to just avoid them. Sneaking through terrorist camps, the DNA of Metal Gear Solid is strongly felt. The character movement, and how the weapons feel, is also similar to MGSV. But otherwise this is a completely different game, with surprising scope for non-violence.Disappointingly, story is Death Stranding's weak link. The broad strokes are great, and Sam's mission to connect a fragmented civilisation is an effective hook. But so much of the finer details are told in uninteresting ways, whether it's through lengthy, overwrought cutscenes, overlong text-heavy emails, or rambling radio chatter. The mythology is a baffling soup of nouns, and I found the characters hard to love, despite the extraordinary realism of their tear-strewn faces. The cast is great, though. Mads Mikkelsen is an engaging and charismatic villain, and there's a compelling otherworldliness to Léa Seydoux's performance as fellow courier Fragile.Thankfully, most of the game is spent out in the field, delivering packages, and battling the elements. But a parade of seemingly never-ending cinematics towards the end really tested my patience—and this is coming from a Kojima fan. That said, there are plenty of memorable set-pieces and moments. The frequent use of songs by Low Roar, an American-Icelandic post-rock project by musician Ryan Karazija, is tastefully done. These haunting, ethereal pieces of music often play over the final stretch of a long journey, with the camera pulling back to reveal more of the landscape. And even when the story is tripping over itself, Death Stranding is always a captivating thing to just look at.The cutscenes, as long and self-indulgent as they are, feature some really imaginative, trippy imagery, and it's rare to see something this offbeat and surreal created with a budget usually reserved for a high-end blockbuster action game. The mechanical design, led by longtime Kojima collaborator Yoji Shinkawa, is consistently impressive too. Sam's gear, the vehicles he drives, and the structures he builds all have a distinctive, idiosyncratic high-tech aesthetic. This is a lavish game in every respect, which playing on a high-end PC in 4K really hammers home. This is undoubtedly the best version.I can see why Death Stranding is such a divisive game, but every misgiving I have about it is ultimately snuffed out by the magnificence of hiking across that sweeping, rugged wilderness. It's an unbelievably slow game with an almost comical amount of backtracking, especially towards the end. Yet, somehow, it kept me interested all the way through. Granted, a ponderous, pensive delivery simulator will be a hard sell for a lot of people. But if you value games that defy genre, reward patience, and aren't afraid to get weird, Death Stranding is a wild ride worth taking, even if it stumbles along the way.Slow, weird, and indulgent, but a true original, and a journey that will linger in your mind long after it's over.If it’s set in space, Andy will probably write about it.

Death Stranding,Oli Welsh,Eurogamer,https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-01-death-stranding-review-a-baffling-haunting-grand-folly,"Walkin' man blues.Small wonder that Sony moved to snap up console-exclusive rights to Hideo Kojima's first game after his acrimonious split with Konami. Kojima and PlayStation have a close relationship that dates back to Metal Gear Solid's debut in 1998. Beyond that, Sony's commissioners have a helpless weakness for the most ambitious and bizarre visions of video gaming's great auteurs and obsessives. If you are a Fumito Ueda, or a David Cage, or a Kazunori Yamauchi, and you have a weird idea for a game that cannot possibly be made on budget and will confuse the hell out of the marketing department, then Sony has a few million dollars with your name on them.Well, Kojima has delivered. On time, surprisingly, but also 100 per cent on brand. The first release from his new studio Kojima Productions and his first non-Metal Gear game since 2003's Boktai, Death Stranding is nothing if not an event. It is at once unmistakable as his work and surpassingly strange. It is grandiose and goofy, liberating and frustrating, thrilling and audaciously dull. It boldly strikes out for new territory even as it gets bogged in the mire of convention. Its preoccupations are nakedly displayed while its plot is borderline incoherent. It's hilariously indulgent of its creator; the production could certainly have used more people who were willing to tell Kojima no. Although perhaps we can be glad they weren't around. If they had been, Death Stranding would be more like other games, and that would be a shame.Mystification at Death Stranding's content and storyline, which has persisted since it was announced, doesn't really end when you start playing it. It turns out the PR wasn't being deliberately enigmatic - it just is that weird. It really is a game about delivering packages in a desolate future where the veil between death and life has been torn. After a catastrophic event known as the death stranding, America is a dangerous wasteland stalked by reckless bandits and frightening apparitions known as BTs. Rain accelerates the passage of time for anything it touches. Understandably, most people live underground. As Sam Porter Bridges - a stolid deliveryman, played by Norman Reedus - you must reconnect a fragmented society by bringing bunker-like waystations, outposts and cities onto the ""chiral network"", a kind of ectoplasmic internet.There's more to it than that, of course. A lot more. This might be Kojima's first time in 15 years working on a blank sheet of paper, but that hasn't held back the tide of lore that engulfed the Metal Gear series - especially in its premature swansong, Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots. He remains instinctively arcane, building Death Stranding's script (he is credited, among other things, as creator, producer and writer) and its world out of acronyms, jargon, portentous nicknames, secret histories, hazy philosophising and oddball, comic-book characters.So Sam is also on a quest to rescue his sister, Amelie (a digitally rejuvenated Lindsay Wagner), from a terrorist known as Higgs (Troy Baker). He is sent on this quest by his mother, President Bridget (also Lindsay Wagner). He works for Bridges, which seems to be a sort of federal corporation in the mould of Amazon and is run by a masked character called, if you can believe it, Die-Hardman (Tommie Earl Jenkins). He is visited by a mysterious woman in a rubber suit with a spiky umbrella called Fragile (Léa Seydoux). He chats, via a Metal Gear-style codec, to a team of Bridges boffins: Deadman (Guillermo del Toro), Heartman (Nicolas Winding Refn) and Mama (Margaret Qualley). And there are visions of a mysterious man, played by Mads Mikkelsen, who seems to be connected to his BB.This BB is an unborn baby that Sam carries around on his chest in a tiny sarcophagus. It helps him establish a connection to the world of the dead, which is called the Beach, because... well, because it's a beach. This allows him to perceive the BTs, or Beached Things, more easily. Sam has a condition called DOOMS, which is never very well explained, and is also a ""repatriate"", which means he can come back from death. Any other human that dies must be instantly cremated or risk creating a ""voidout"" when their body is seized by the BTs, blowing a crater in the map. In this world, killing people really isn't advisable.It's an odd universe, laden with symbolism: bridges, ropes, hands, babies, umbilical cords and the signifiers of death are everywhere. If it has an eerie power - and it definitely does - it is not thanks to the heavy-handed thematic treatment or the clumsy writing. Seldom has a game worked so hard to explain itself only to fail. The actors spend most of their time valiantly wading through a tar pit of exposition that somehow does little to advance your understanding or flesh out their strikingly designed characters. (In fact, this game is so obsessed with exposition that it continues through, and then past, the end credits. The entire hours-long final act of the game is so overblown, it's a scarcely believable display of hubris.)Credit where it's due to the cast: Qualley adds a much-needed note of relatable humanity; Seydoux does her best with a faintly icky characterisation. Reedus does the gruff everyman thing well enough and his compact physicality really grounds Sam as an avatar. Del Toro, the acclaimed Mexican film director and connoisseur of pop-culture weirdness, seems to be having the most fun with this nonsense, and is a lively presence throughout. Kojima continues to have an awkward relationship with his female characters, who are objectified or mythologised in uncomfortable ways: mothers, sisters, soulmates and tragic ghosts, often muddled together. It's fair to say that the men are hardly more than ciphers, either.Where does Death Stranding get its strange power from, then? Why will it linger in the memory long after the 50 hours or so (not counting sidequests) you spend playing it? At this point, it's worth puncturing the image of Kojima as gaming's supreme auteur to remind yourself that he has had a vital collaborator on almost every one of his games: the artist Yoji Shinkawa. Together, Kojima and Shinkawa have created indelible characters and crafted a signature look: a kind of muscular, sinuous, faintly sinister futurism, powered by robotics and haunted by the bomb. Death Stranding, on which Shinkawa served as art director, weaves in a new strand of ghostly horror, and is perhaps their most potent creation yet.It cuts Metal Gear's ties with the real world; although nominally set maybe 100 years in the future, Death Stranding feels as if it exists much farther off. It's a distant, bleak fantasy of humanity drifting toward oblivion. The landscapes are stark, melancholy, empty. Hard, clean materials streak with rust in the ""timefall"". The technology is skeletal: one particularly memorable creation, brilliantly animated, is the Ordradek, a flower-like scanning arm that sits on Sam's shoulder, pulsing, spinning and pointing to indicate the presence of BTs. The BTs themselves are genuinely haunting. They manifest, variously, as sudden handprints in black mud; floating, smoky figures tethered by winding umbilical chords; grasping torsos emerging from puddles of tar; and ghastly, thrashing, monstrous fish.Sam trudges across this unsettling, beautiful space, bringing packages from one place to another. That really is the substance of Death Stranding: fetch quests. It could almost be a parody of rote open-world game design, but it turns out that Kojima Productions is deadly serious about it. It wants the simple act of navigating this world, from A to B, to be challenging and evocative. It is. Sam must carry his load on his back, stacked high, and he must bring the equipment he needs with him, too: weaponry, ladders, climbing ropes, supplies, spare boots in case his wear out. He has finite stamina and endurance reserves, and you need to think about weight distribution and balance. The landscape is rugged, so you need to plot your routes carefully, pulling the controller's triggers to keep Sam on an even keel. Climbing is hard, but descending is more dangerous still, and if you topple your cargo may be damaged.It is steady, hypnotic stuff. Some may find it boring. I enjoy hiking myself and found it startlingly true-to-life to pick my way through the rocky outcrops, footfall by footfall. The maps encourage this, being convincingly organic, meticulously designed and completely open. I liked the game best when I planned a circuitous route for a delivery and was rewarded with a long, lonely walk through silent, beautiful views; or when I figured out that I could shortcut a very long delivery by taking a risky, gruelling trek through a high mountain pass. The loop is one of careful preparation - selecting your equipment, optimising your load, planning your route - followed by the journey. It's fair to say that it can be pretty dry, and the micromanagement can be onerous. But at its rigorous best, Death Stranding reframes your relationship with an open-world landscape in much the same way that The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild did.For both better and worse, that's not all there is to it. There are vehicles - bikes and trucks - though they're not always well suited to the landscape. There is combat with human bandits, which is a blend of stealth and scrappy, panicky combat familiar from Metal Gear. There are BT encounters, which are wonderfully creepy and suspenseful at first, as you try to crawl past the ghouls without being detected, but aggravating and strangely pointless when you are caught and must face one of the larger apparitions, which can be fought or fled from. There are some boss battles, though none to match the classic, theatrical encounters Kojima has staged in the past. As in Metal Gear, there is an abundance of overdeveloped, underused gadgetry and systems. As in Metal Gear, there is a satisfyingly exacting way to play, but you are just as likely to blunder or brute force your way through. DF's John Linneman loved his time with Death Stranding and reckons it's ""a unique, stunning vision powered by state-of-the-art technology"". Check out his video above, or read the full tech report for John's analysis (and superior screenshots).Here's another contradiction for you: it is a very lonely game, but you are never alone. Death Stranding takes Dark Souls' idea that other players can leave messages in your game and expands upon it. Once you have connected an area to the chiral network, you can see messages and use equipment players have left behind, entrust deliveries to them or pick them up, and collaborate with them on building useful infrastructure like roads, safe houses and shelters. Sometimes this kills the mood a little, but more often than not it's a life saver, and there's nothing more pleasing than creating a particularly useful structure and having it go viral. Other players reward you with Likes, which you also earn from making your deliveries and other in-game actions, and which seem to be the most prized currency in this world. They are Death Stranding's equivalent of experience points and feed into a fuzzily defined character progression system.Both the Likes and Sam's job - a kind of heroic, public-service version of a gig-economy courier - have a deliberately mundane and contemporary resonance in this otherwise otherworldly setting. I think it's deliberate, anyway, and Kojima does have something to say about how we are engineering ourselves into a state of busy isolation (though some might question his thesis that the best way to bring people together is by expanding network coverage). The commentary is earnest, if a little on the nose. Sadly, it gets lost in a froth of stoned-undergrad-grade existential waffle towards the end of the game, as Kojima strains unsuccessfully to make something meaningful of his nonsensical story and garbled lore.As the credits roll on Death Stranding, heavy with unearned pathos, the impression you're left with is of a self-congratulatory monument to the ego of a creator who is high on his own supply. Has Kojima always been this full of it? Maybe. But then you return to the game proper, select a humble delivery order, lace up your boots and plan another reckoning with those unforgettable, haunted moors. And you realise that this game has got under your skin in a way few do.You're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!

Death Stranding,David Jenkins,Metro GameCentral,https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/01/death-stranding-review-delivering-the-goods-11022052/,"The creator of Metal Gear Solid delivers a PS4 exclusive as only Hideo Kojima could, but how does Death Stranding compare to his other classics?Death Stranding involves a lot of explaining. The first thing anyone asks is ‘What is it about?’ and ‘What do you do?’ and yet for the longest time the game itself struggles to answer those questions, with extended bouts of exposition and tutorial tips that are still being generated several hours after you’ve first started. And yet at its heart the game, and even its story, is fairly straightforward. Or at least as straightforward as anything from Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima ever gets.One problem with Death Stranding is that as soon as anyone starts to describe the game it instantly begins to seem less interesting than you imagined. In part that’s because it combines two of gaming’s most controversial concepts into one: the walking simulator and fetch quests. Whether Kojima did this on purpose, as some sort of meta level irony, is, as with many of his design decisions, difficult to tell. But what we can say is that the Death Stranding is the most entertaining postal delivery simulator we’ve ever played.The setting for the game is post-apocalyptic America, where a ‘Death Stranding’ (imagery of cetacean stranding is rife throughout the game) has occurred, which has linked the living world with the land of the dead. This has caused several problems, not least that the body of anyone who dies turns into an anti-matter time bomb, which has already caused the destruction of most major cities. On top of that, when it rains the water rapidly ages anything it touches and invisible creatures called BTs (beached things) stalk the land and actively hunt the living.Exactly how many people are left in the world is never made clear. In fact, a lot of the back story remains peculiarly vague for the entire game, with no other country other than America ever mentioned. And even though the time frame only seems to be the near future what’s left of mankind has somehow mastered instant 3D printing using a substance called chiralium, which is left behind by BTs. That in turn has led to the creation of an organisation called Bridges which has set up new cities across the country and is trying to establish an Internet equivalent called the Chiral Network.Although getting the Chiral Network up and running across the whole US is one of the main goals of the game Bridges is not well trusted by the populace. The US government is all but defunct and instead everyone, somewhat strangely, places more confidence in couriers; or porters as they’re called in the game. (Why they don’t just use flying drones, which we already have today, is handwaved away by a throwaway line.) That’s where you come in, as you play Sam Bridges – a surly loner who also happens to be the son of the last President of the United States and brother to the would-be successor.Sam’s sister is kidnapped by terrorists just before the game begins and rescuing her from the westernmost city is how he’s finally convinced to help set up the Chiral Network, by visiting outposts and linking each one up with a set of magic/high-tech dog tags. Why everything is ready to work except for that and nobody else managed to turn it on beforehand is not something the plot addresses, we assume because that’s not what Kojima is interested in. What he is interested in though is using it as a very literal example of connecting people… after you perform a fetch quest or two for them.In terms of gameplay Death Stranding features very little traditional action and only a modicum of stealth. At first you can only avoid BTs, after you’re given a BB (bridge baby) which is a newborn child in a jar born to a brain-dead mother and which is aligned to neither the world of the living or dead. Your particular BB has a major impact on the story but its gameplay purpose is to make BTs partially visible. There’s really only one type of BT, plus boss type creatures if you get caught by them, but as you’d expect from the creator of Metal Gear the stealth action works very well and is impressively tense.The third person gunplay is also a lot of fun, but it comes up much less often. There’s also the problem that you can’t afford to kill anyone because their corpse will take out the whole area. That’s actually a very clever way to try and make a non-violent action game but Kojima seems curiously indifferent to the potential and the implications are not something the story dwells on. There’s lots of airy talk about connecting people but the fact that you don’t dare kill anyone is barely even mentioned, which seems a huge missed opportunity in terms of matching gameplay with narrative.Rather than stealth or combat the main gameplay focus is simply delivering parcels. Each new outpost you visit will want something collected or delivered and once you’ve done that they’ll agree to join the Chiral Network and you can move on. Making your delivery might involve a run in with BTs or bandits but not necessarily, and so the only consistent obstacle to your progress becomes the terrain itself.Peculiarly, the geography looks nothing like the real US, unless there are vast swathes of the country that are covered in glacial boulders and basalt columns that we’re unaware of. Obviously, there are some – it’s a big country – but almost every square metre of the game map is covered in boulders that make traversal, especially by vehicles, very difficult.The large open world map, split into two separate areas, is highly reminiscent of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild but despite being such a large focus the traversal in Death Stranding is not as intrinsically entertaining. Sam cannot climb vertically for any distance without a rope and so either has to use a giant extendable ladder or just find a way around.The other gameplay difficulty is that as a porter you use yourself as essentially a pack horse, attaching huge boxes to every part of your body until you’re absurdly overburdened. You can still move around fairly easily though; you just have to lean into it and correct your balance using the trigger buttons. As a result, balancing your load so you’re not top heavy becomes vitally importantly, although thankfully there is an auto arrange button to help.And that, pretty much, is Death Stranding.If you’re thinking all this sounds a little dull, you’re not entirely wrong. There is nothing intrinsically entertaining about walking around with giant boxes tied to your body and the combat is rare enough that it only ever works as a brief palate cleanser. But there is something strangely compelling about working your way across the country, connecting everyone up and being rewarded with new gadgets if you do more than just the minimum amount of deliveries.There are also some interesting online options, where although you never meet other players directly you do see the objects they build – bridges, fast travel spots, etc. – in your world and can even help to upgrade them with your own resources. Although that does slightly unbalance the difficulty if you get to an area that a lot of other people have already visited, and it’s already filled with gadgets that help you side-step some of the trickier traversal issues.In story terms, Kojima manages to keep his worst indulgencies at bay until the end of the game, with most cut scenes and dialogue sequences being relatively succinct; until suddenly he decides every plot point has to be hammered home with a mallet in the final hours. Thematically though the game has some serious problems. For one it’s absolutely obsessed with America and yet what Kojima thinks about the country and what it stands for is not made clear at all. Not only does the game not look anything like the US but none of the characters or plot points seem uniquely American.Show the game to a random passer-by and they’d just assume it was set on another planet, which would be fine except the word ‘America’ is in almost every second line of dialogue, with ‘connect’, or some variation, right after it.There’s also a problem in the people you’re supposedly connecting with. Although there’s a handful of typically colourful main characters the ordinary ones you spend most of the game taking orders from are an extremely dull bunch that it’s impossible to gain any attachment to. You also technically never meet them, as in almost every case you’re just talking to a single person via a hologram.Most buildings seem like they’re supposed to be large underground facilities, presumably with many people living there, but it’s never made explicitly clear and some of them definitely do seem to be occupied by just one or two people. Even when you visit a city that has multiple small houses all the doors are locked and you never see a soul, which is very odd.Perhaps the absence of real people, and the fact that you never really meet anyone, is meant to be a commentary on the incorporeal nature of Internet socialising but considering how on the nose a lot of the other plot points are that seems a stretch.We’re used to some games not realising their full potential but the strange thing about Death Stranding is that it ignores the story implications of its lack of violence in favour of vague pontificating about not being a loner and the impermanence of existence. That and an increasing obsession with plot twists that, while nonsensical, are still easy to predict simply because they seem like the sort of thing Kojima would do.The dialogue in cut scenes is generally good, if long-winded and repetitive, but the facial animation is superb, with some of the best acting performances gaming has ever seen. The cinematography is equally good too, which combined with the graphics makes this one of the best-looking games of the generation. If not actually the best.The PS5 second phase is going to be worse than the first - Reader’s FeatureGames Inbox: Is Halo a dead franchise?Sony forced to reveal PlayStation exclusive deals by US senatorBut taken as a whole Death Stranding is an awkward mishmash of ideas, some of which work exactly as intended and others of which feel entirely out of place. At 40+ hours it overstays its welcome but it’s still a fascinating journey to take, with Kojima being the only video games auteur who can still command a large budget and use it to create something that isn’t just pandering to mainstream tastes.For that alone he and Sony deserve all the praise they can get, but Death Stranding still feels like a missed opportunity. All the elements are there to make a classic game but, ironically, they haven’t been connected up in a way that makes the most thematic and gameplay sense. Some will love the game and some will hate it, but most will be stranded somewhere in the middle.In Short: A work of unbridled ambition and imagination but also a pretentious, contrived, and frequently quite dull gameplay experience – Death Stranding is peak Hideo Kojima.Pros: Fascinatingly strange game world and main characters. Solid combat and stealth mechanics. Superb graphics, with excellent voice-acting and facial animation. Interesting online features.Cons: The core gameplay loop of delivering packages can be very boring and repetitive. Narrative doesn’t align properly with the non-violent gameplay.Score: 7/10

Death Stranding,Matthew Kato,Game Informer,https://www.gameinformer.com/review/death-stranding/death-stranding-review-the-wanderer,"The mystery around Death Stranding has piqued everyone’s curiosity as to the game’s true nature. Part of this is down to the creator himself, Hideo Kojima, who has consistently obfuscated his titles with complex stories, themes, and the personal fancies of an auteur. It’s also due to the incredulous feeling that there must be more to the game than what we’ve seen so far. Surely players must do more than transport cargo – a video game trope in and of itself. But Death Stranding (whose main character is named Sam Porter Bridges, no less) is unable to muster significance.In order to rebuild America after a mysterious event that has blown a crater in the middle of the country and destroyed society as we know it, Sam treks across the land delivering supplies and connecting pockets of survivors. Doing so requires loading Sam up with packages of various sizes, weights, and possibly mission-ending stipulations – such as breaking fragile equipment and even delivering a pizza correctly.I was initially frustrated by the teeter-totter nature of keeping my balance while traversing rocky, moss-covered landscapes. As I leveled up and became proficient in my movements (the terrain is thankfully consistent in terms of what does and doesn’t trip you up), I realized the fight to stay upright isn’t the fundamental problem with the core gameplay concept. The real issue is that Death Stranding’s gameplay really is as simple as it appears to be, and the elements around it – the story, combat, and lackluster mission objectives – aren’t satisfying enough to anchor the title and get players invested.Death Stranding has optional side missions and ways to build up the infrastructure of the world, such as making roads and other helpful structures, but the core delivery loop doesn’t branch out in more interesting directions. Your objectives are straightforward and unsurprising; they don’t expand Sam’s interaction with the world, nor do they require novel resourcefulness. It’s all about the journey, as they say, but when the journey feels dull, that’s not a good thing. Combat is also part of Sam’s travels, but it’s not demanding or engaging. Multi-dimensional spirits called BTs rise from the ground and apparate from the air, but they feel more like nuisances than challenges – similar to random encounters in an RPG that cause you to swear more than lick your chops. Marauders called MULEs get physically tougher and have guns and trucks to hunt you down, but defeating them is easy, whether using guns, melee blows, or stealth. Don’t expect the ingenuity or problem-solving required in the Metal Gear series; enemies’ A.I. routines and reactions don’t enliven your interactions with them or encourage experimentation.Sure, it’s fun to knock marauders down with a piece of luggage in your hand, but you can’t drive them from an area, their encampments are basic, and their loot (unless tied to a specific mission) isn’t particularly enticing since the items can be found elsewhere in the world. Combat is non-essential to the point that plain hoofing it is as effective as any weapon when dealing with both BTs and MULEs. Even the boss battles, if they can even be called that, are simple encounters of shooting and evading over multiple rounds. They lack the inventiveness and thrill of Kojima’s previous efforts, to say nothing of other games. This is a shame, because you can fabricate some pretty useful equipment, like grenade launchers and camouflage rocks you can hide under, despite an absence of compelling situations in which to apply them.Overall, Death Stranding’s intertwining systems are well thought out. Rain and snow (called Timefall) damage everything they touch, so I like the sense of urgent survival when the weather report shows precipitation on the way. Building zip-lines and safe houses in useful areas is satisfying, especially since they augment the overall network of nodes that keep you supplied and aid your travels.Death Stranding’s online connectivity is one of the game’s strengths, not only because other real-life players add useful items like ladders and warning signs to your world, but because it achieves what it tries to do: It creates bonds. I liked knowing I was helping others when I erected a bridge or anchored a rope at a key location, and enjoyed giving others praise for their efforts via the like system. Regardless, this sentiment wanes amidst the larger morass of routine.That the game ultimately comes up short is unfortunate, because there were times when I was spurred on to complete my delivery mission. Coming over a ridge, reflecting on how far I’d come and knowing that I just had to make it across one final expanse before delivering my cargo felt like sweet relief at times. The game is also visually stunning, which helps when spending all that time traveling from one place to another.Try as it might, Death Stranding’s story doesn’t shore up its faults. It’s the normal Kojima mix of twists-and-turns, tropes, and overbearing themes, but at least I like that it explores real-world topics like the theory of multiple dimensions and key events in the history of the planet’s biodiversity. Like Sam himself, I often wasn’t sure why I kept going in Death Stranding. Maybe there was a little bit of pride in another task checked off the list, another job done. Unfortunately, this added up to little reward in the end.

   on July 13, 2020 at 3:36PM PDTPC version update: The vast, beautiful, desolate world of Death Stranding lives on PC in top-notch form. After about 15 hours with the game, I'm drawn back into its melodramatic story and unique gameplay loop of cargo delivery simulation and harrowing stealth-action. To reconnect the country in Death Stranding is to also connect with the many players who are doing the same, and through asynchronous multiplayer design, you both engage in rebuilding the world together while helping one another do your in-game jobs.Given the right specs, the PC version of Death Stranding can look and run much better than it did on the PS4 Pro (I played using a Core i7-7700K CPU and RTX 2080 video card). I ran 2560x1080 resolution, as the game supports native 21:9 ultrawide aspect ratio, and every setting maxed out while using Nvidia's DLSS antialiasing option. And through action sequences and heavy weather hikes, the frame rate is consistently in the high 90 FPS to 110 FPS. This is a proper PC port that looks stunning and runs smooth.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

It's a tall order. A lot of people believe in it, but you're not sure you do. It'll take a lot of lonely, dangerous walks and exceptionally heavy lifting, and it's not really clear what America means in the first place. For some reason, you set out anyway, trudging through wetlands and rocky hills on foot, not fully knowing or understanding where you're going. Other than the monsters you can't quite see, there's not really anyone else around most of the time--just you and your thoughts, one foot in front of the other.On one level, Death Stranding is about America. But your actual goal in setting out across the country is to help people, bring them together, and forge connections, not for the vague concept of America but for the sake of helping the people within it. Death Stranding is unrelenting in its earnestness and optimism--certainly not without its critiques of America, nor without its challenges and setbacks, but inherently hopeful nonetheless. It is a dense, complex, slow game with a plot that really goes places, but at its core, it never stops being about the sheer power and purpose we can find in human connection, and that is its most remarkable achievement.Rebuilding the country is as simple as getting every far-flung city, outpost, and individual onto one network, the bones of which were laid down by a pseudo-government organization called Bridges. As Sam Porter Bridges (played by Norman Reedus), all you have to do to win people over is bring them packages; most people never go outside due to mysterious monsters called BTs, but unlike most people, Sam can sense them enough to sneak past them and get important cargo to its destination.Deliveries can be arduous. You're evaluated on your deliveries across a few categories, but the condition of the cargo can make or break a run, and there are a lot of factors working against you. The landscape can be extremely punishing, from expanses of exhaustingly rocky hills to rivers that are too deep and wide to cross unaided. On top of BTs, you also have to contend with Timefall, a kind of rain that rapidly accelerates aging and deterioration for most of the things it touches. Extended exposure to Timefall can damage or completely ruin your cargo, as can slipping and falling, getting hit by an enemy, or, in some cases, just being a little too rough with it. Even the smallest rocks can trip you up, too. In order to keep your footing, you need to pay close attention to where you're stepping, keeping your balance with the triggers while on rough terrain or when carrying a lot of stuff.Once you reach your destination, though, you're showered with praise. The recipient will likely thank you to your face (albeit as a hologram), and then they'll give you a series of social media-style likes. You're inundated with a multi-page results screen itemizing all the likes you received for the delivery and in which categories, plus an overall rating for the delivery itself, no matter how small--it's positive reinforcement turned up to 11. These likes then funnel into each of the delivery categories like experience points, and as you level up, you can carry more weight or better maintain your balance, among other benefits. Deliveries also feed into a connection rating with each city, outpost, or person, and as that increases, you acquire better gear and sometimes gifts to reward your efforts further.In short, you give a lot and get a lot in return. There is a relatively small number of mandatory deliveries to advance the story, but there's a seemingly unlimited number of optional deliveries, and I often found myself picking up orders destined for any place that was on my way. It's a cycle that's easy to get swept up in; no matter how difficult a delivery or how far the distance, you will at least be met with gratitude, likely feel fulfilled from having completed a tough delivery, and often given a tool to make future deliveries a bit easier. Most importantly, though, increasing your bonds with people is how you get them on the network, and the network is what elevates this core loop beyond the simple satisfaction of completing tasks and getting rewards.The chiral network is a kind of souped-up internet that allows you to 3D print objects, which is incredibly useful and a strong incentive in itself. When at a terminal connected to the chiral network, you can print ladders and ropes for traversal, new boots as yours wear out, repair spray for damaged containers, and basically anything else you need to safely deliver cargo so long as you have a blueprint for it. You can also print a portable printer that builds structures for you out in open areas covered by the network--things like bridges, watchtowers, and generators, the latter of which are critical as you start to use battery-powered exoskeletons and vehicles.The chiral network also grants you access to the online component of the game, which is absolutely essential. You never see other players in the flesh, but their impact is all around you; once an area is on the network, you can see structures and objects left behind by other players in the course of their own journeys, plus helpful signs they've put down just for those who come after them. You can pick up someone else's lost cargo and deliver it for them, too, knowing that someone else may find yours at some point and do you the same kindness.In Death Stranding's best moments, the relief and gratitude you can feel toward someone you don't even know is an unrivaled multiplayer experience. At one point in my playthrough, I was being chased by MULEs, human enemies who love to steal cargo. I was on a bike, tasked with a time-sensitive delivery, almost out of battery and totally unequipped to deal with external threats. In my panic, I drove my bike into a ravine. As I slowly made my way up and out of it, I watched as my bike's battery dipped into the red, and I dreaded getting stuck with all my cargo and no vehicle, still quite a ways away from my destination. I rounded a corner and found myself in the charging area of a generator placed by another player, as if they'd known I'd need it in that exact spot at that exact moment. They probably just put it there because they needed a quick charge, but to me, it was a lifeline.You can give and receive likes for these player-to-player structures, and just like with standard deliveries, it's a strong incentive to do something helpful for someone else. In the earlier sections of the game, I was using other people's structures far more than I was leaving behind help for others. But I wanted to pay it forward and know that my help was appreciated, so I started going out of my way to build structures I myself didn't really need; the map shows the online structures in your instance, making it easier to spot areas you could fill in for others. At first, the likes system seems like a pretty obvious commentary on social media and our dependence on external validation. But it's not so much a critique as it is a positive spin on a very human need for acceptance, and the system does a remarkable job of urging you to do your best for those around you, NPCs and real people alike. Feeling truly appreciated can be a rare occurrence in life, and it's powerful in its simplicity here.The first few hours of the game are the slowest, and a large part of that is because you don't have access to the online component right away. It's an incredibly lonely stretch of time during which you mostly just walk; the work you do early on is especially laborious in the absence of advanced gear, and it serves to give you an appreciation for other players and better gear as you move forward.Even as the gameplay opens up, you continue to get a lot of story exposition with almost no explanation. It can all seem kind of goofy at first, and you can get lost in the metaphors; every city you need to add to the chiral network has ""knot"" in its name, for example, and they are all referred to as ""knots"" on a strand that connects the country. There's bizarre and unwarranted product placement in the form of Monster Energy drinks and the show Ride with Norman Reedus. Guillermo del Toro's likeness is used for a kind of dorky character called Deadman, and there's a woman named Fragile in a game about delivering packages.But the story really does go deeper than that. In keeping with the theme of human connection, each of the core characters you meet and work with has their own story to tell. They all have a unique perspective on death that lends them an equally unique perspective on life, and unravelling their characters, down to the true origins of their often literal names, contributes to the overall tapestry of Death Stranding's take on the human experience. As they open up to Sam, Sam opens up to them in turn, developing into a distinct character in his own right out of the reserved, emotionless man he appears to be at the start. I grew to love Sam, Fragile, and Heartman especially, and even the characters I didn't like as much add to the game's overall message about hope and love in the face of adversity.By far my favorite character--and the most important one--is BB. BBs are infants in pods that can detect the presence of BTs, and they're issued to porters like Sam to help them navigate dangerous territory. You're told to treat BBs like equipment, not real babies, but it's impossible to think of your BB that way. It's full of personality, giggling when happy and crying when stressed out; it even gives you likes from time to time. There aren't many children left in Death Stranding's isolated, fearful world, but BB is your reminder that the future is counting on you, regardless of how you feel about America itself. The love that grows between Sam and BB is nothing short of heartwarming.Connecting with this story, just as with connecting with NPCs and other players, can take work. It's not a story that immediately clicks on a surface level, and the dramatic mystery and off-the-wall science don't make too much sense at first blush. But it's an emotional story first and foremost, and making sense of things--while entirely possible, particularly if you read the letters and interviews that detail small bits of lore as you go--is not as important as reflecting on how it makes you feel.You have plenty of opportunities to do that, too. In the quiet moments of travel, usually as you near your destination, music might start to play. The soundtrack, which is largely composed of one band--Low Roar--is phenomenal, the kind of contemplative folk-ish music that suits a trip alone through a meadow or down a mountain. Because the act of walking is so involved, it's not a time to detach completely and zone out; it's a time to feel your feelings or at least consider what's next in your travels.You can just as soon be ripped out of that headspace, though, by a shift to the haunting music that signals BT territory. The otherworldly growls of BTs as they close in on you can be terrifying, and early on, your best bet is to freeze in your tracks and hold your breath for as long as you can so you can quietly sneak by them. But there are times when you have to fight a BT in its true form, and for that, you have specialized weapons to take them down. These BTs aren't the ethereal humanoid shapes that float above the ground but huge eldritch horrors that screech under clouds of blood. The combat is mechanically simple--you mostly have to move around a bit and hit them before they hit you--but the sequences are visually and aurally arresting.You don't get a gun that works on live enemies until 25 or so hours in, but even then, it's non-lethal. You are actively guided away from killing in Death Stranding, because when people die, their bodies basically go nuclear and level cities, leaving nothing but craters and BTs in their wake. On top of that, the main human enemies are MULEs, former porters just like Sam that have been corrupted by an automated world--they've essentially become addicted to snatching cargo in their desperation to have a job and a purpose as more and more people become replaced by machines. They're not evil, and killing them seems like, well, overkill; it's easy enough to knock them out with the nonlethal methods you continue to unlock as the game progresses. I didn't kill a single one in my playthrough, though punching them is satisfying.While BTs and MULEs are a concern when delivering cargo, there's also Mads Mikkelsen's character, a man who's introduced through memories Sam sees when he connects to BB's pod. He gets his own dedicated segments that punctuate hours of simple deliveries, and these highly contained, much shorter sections are striking in their art direction and juxtaposition to the rest of the game. It's not immediately clear what he is, whether it's an enemy, potential friend, or something else entirely, but he's captivating in his ambiguity.The most cartoonish enemy is Troy Baker's Higgs, a terrorist whose depravity seems to know no bounds. Of all the characters, Higgs is the weakest, with far less nuance to him than anyone else in the cast. He's really just there as a Big Bad to motivate you in a more traditional video game sense than delivering packages and helping people, but he and his band of faceless terrorists are more a means to an end than full-fledged villains. He's the catalyst for some of the major BT fights, and in the end, perhaps an extreme reminder that it's possible to stay hopeful even when things are darkest.Death Stranding argues in both its story and its gameplay that adversity itself is what makes things worth doing and life worth living.Death Stranding is a hard game to absorb. There are many intertwining threads to its plot, and silly names, corny moments, and heavy exposition belie an otherwise very simple message. That comes through much more clearly in the game's more mundane moments, when you find a desperately-needed ladder left behind by another player or receive a letter from an NPC thanking you for your efforts. It's positive without ignoring pain; in fact, it argues in both its story and its gameplay that adversity itself is what makes things worth doing and life worth living. It's a game that requires patience, compassion, and love, and it's also one we really need right now.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"
Death Stranding,Russ Frushtick,Polygon,https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/11/1/20942070/death-stranding-review-hideo-kojima-ps4,"Filed under:The most advanced walking simulator the world has ever seenIf you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.Video game quests come in all shapes and sizes. There are big, splashy main-story quests. There are quests that reveal the dark backstory of one of your compatriots. There are the obnoxious follow-that-stranger-without-being-seen quests. And then, at the very bottom of the unspoken quest hierarchy, there are ... fetch quests. After years of wondering what Death Stranding actually is, I can finally report that it’s a game composed entirely of fetch quests. Forty-plus hours of that may sound like torture, but shockingly, it’s actually pretty damn fun once it gets out of its own way. Before you start delivering boxes to and fro, you should know that Death Stranding’s story is weird. I’ll spare you the intricate lexicon that Hideo Kojima created to describe every bizarre paranormal phenomenon, but here’s the quickie version: Most of America is gone because ghosts showed up and killed people. When those people died, their bodies blew up. And people caught in those blasts also blew up. The initial event was called the Death Stranding, and it wiped out a very large chunk of America’s population. All that remains are small, walled city-states, completely cut off from one another. Now there’s an immediate need for “porters” — people assigned to deliver supplies to the different cities, risking their hides in the dangerous wastelands of America — in this new, splintered country. That’s where Sam Bridges (Norman Reedus) comes in. He has developed a reputation as a top-notch porter, and is enlisted by the president — who also happens to be his mom (!) — to travel the wastes and bring the isolated cities back into the fold by connecting them to a fancy data network. “If we don’t all come together again, humanity will not survive,” the president says.This all sounds pretty grandiose, but the actual process of reconnecting the cities is far simpler: Sam walks there, asks if they’re up for it, and jacks them in during a cutscene. Some of the inhabitants take some convincing, asking Sam for a favor or two before he can plug in the Ethernet cable. Then, once they’re on the grid, Sam continues making his way west.The actual walking in Death Stranding is incredibly complex: Each small rock or ledge is capable of tripping Sam, sending his packages flying. I find myself constantly scanning the environment, surveying the landscape to find the smoothest possible route through a perilous rocky outcropping. There’s no automatic parkour or physics-defying cliff climbing here. Every step I take needs to be intentional, or I might end up taking a serious tumble. When I overload my pack I have to use the left and right triggers to balance my weight, or else I risk falling over, damaging my goods. It’s equally engaging and frustrating as I topple over after twisting my ankle, forcing myself to restack all my belongings. Death Stranding is a walking simulator in the truest sense.Kojima and his team devote Death Stranding’s first 10 hours to breaking up the walking gameplay with melodramatic cutscenes that seek to explain the game’s world. These cutscenes are outrageously overwritten and long, frequently stating (and then repeating) the same talking points, dragging the pace of the introduction to an absolute crawl. This is, after all, a Kojima game, and he’s nothing if not verbose. The stilted, over-the-top writing frequently gets in the way of some solid performances, notably from Reedus and from Lindsay Wagner as Sam’s mother, the president.It’s a true feat to be able to deliver some of the game’s dialogue in a convincing way (e.g., “Bridget, you’re the president of jack shit”). While some of the actors can pull this off, others, like Léa Seydoux (who plays a character called Fragile), have a tough time selling the emotion of the stiff writing. There’s also the weird sense that Kojima tried to jam many of his famous friends in as cameos, with mixed results. Director Guillermo del Toro wisely provided just his likeness for one of the main characters, Deadman, leaving the voice acting to Jesse Corti, who does a solid job. But then Conan O’Brien shows up in a side mission, and suddenly the illusion of this world is dashed.  The story’s best moments depart from Kojima’s technobabble — “a cryptobiote a day keeps the timefall away,” says Fragile at one point — in favor of telling personal stories about the survivors of this twisted world and what motivates them to keep going. A boyfriend and girlfriend longing to be together, yet separated by an impassable desert of death. A pair of sisters who haven’t spoken in years but still share some kind of connection. These smaller stories are the ones that click in Death Stranding. The larger, grander tale — about the apocalyptic “Death Stranding” itself, the mystery of what caused it, and the challenges of fixing it — ends up feeling wooden in comparison.It takes about 10 hours for the throat-clearing to wrap up and for Death Stranding’s structure and mechanics to fully reveal themselves. And those 10 hours are some of the weakest in the game, thanks to the endless cutscenes and a series of bummer quests that have me lugging packages (and even a corpse!) up steep hills in the rain. I’m never given a great reason for these initial chores; I do them because I’m told I must. It is the epitome of a slog, and it’s easy to imagine that many players won’t ever make it past this stretch of the game.But even if you do, here’s the thing: The entire game is about lugging packages. That’s what you’ll be doing whenever you’re in control of Sam: bringing a box or boxes from one part of the map to another. Saying it out loud, it sounds like absolute misery.

  Something clicked for me after those first 10 hours, though. The basic loop of many open-world games involves starting out as a puny nobody and, over dozens of hours of exploring a wide expanse, gaining wondrous abilities to become a walking god. But that never really happens in Death Stranding. Sam essentially has the same abilities at the end of the story as he did in the beginning. A few handy gadgets and a little extra carrying capacity, maybe. But generally speaking, he’s the same ordinary guy with a stack of boxes. Combat sequences emphasize his limited skill set, as he’s better off avoiding conflict rather than dealing with it head-on. Occasional missions that require Sam to mix it up with people as he goes about his delivery route feel almost like an afterthought compared to his normal day-to-day travails.Something does evolve over the course of Death Stranding, but it’s not Sam; it’s the world around him. I put a ladder on the ground, creating a makeshift bridge to cross a river that may ruin some of my cargo. That ladder then has a chance to show up in other players’ games, making their own trip across the river easier. It works the same in reverse, as I suddenly start seeing helpful ropes, ladders, and footpaths popping up in this ruined America, placed there by other folks playing the game. These player-made structures don’t show up until I’ve connected a specific region to the network. The areas are barren and wild as I begin to explore them, but over time, they slowly become civilized, with some zones dramatically transformed in the process. There are plenty of hazards in the world of Death Stranding, and the aforementioned ghosts who kicked the whole mess off are some of the worst. Called BTs (for “beached things” ... because reasons), the ghosts make it incredibly dangerous to cross open plains, requiring stealth and constant awareness.Sam’s jar-enclosed baby (they’re called BBs; his is BB-28) is the star during these sequences. Humans can’t spot the ghosts with the naked eye, but BBs can. They don’t offer you radar on a minimap, though. All you get is a constant flashing and pointing of Sam’s back-mounted mechanical arm, which the BB controls to indicate the location of the nearest ghost. There are ways to aggressively handle the BTs later in the game, but in the early hours you’re just supposed to avoid them, as silently as possible. This proves especially difficult when you’re lugging a steamer trunk filled with — let me check my notes — ah yes, sperm at one point. At least that’s better than the corpse?There’s one acre of land I keep having to cross for deliveries that’s absolutely swarming with BTs. Whenever I get snagged by accident, sticky tar appears around my feet. I once spent too much time in the muck, and was suddenly dragged 50 feet by a massive, tar-covered sea beast (again, because reasons) that seemed none too concerned about the much-needed sperm I was carrying.The world around me transformed as tar sprang up everywhere, leaving just a few safe places to jump to. I had no idea what was happening or why, but suddenly I had to escape this thing, while trying to gather up my lost belongings amid the chaos. It was an outrageous visual spectacle, but not one I wanted to keep seeing, as it definitely made the task at hand considerably harder.But I slowly make my way through, time after time, becoming a true ghost-dodging master. While I became adept at these sequences, I wouldn’t call them super fun to play. They feel more like a game of Marco Polo, but instead of asshole cousins around a pool, it’s tar-summoning monster whales.So I decide to make an investment. Instead of lugging another package, I load up Sam’s backpack with a ton of materials and hike out with a plan: I’m gonna build a goddamn highway right over these ghosts. This requires thousands of materials (earned from doing quests for various cities) and can be a huge resource sink, but it’s absolutely worth it. Once constructed, the road stretches right over the land where the BTs hang, neutralizing them entirely. An area that previously took me 10 minutes of careful stealth to cross now takes seconds.Not only does my highway save me a ton of time, it also starts showing up in my friends’ games. They message me photos of them driving on my highway, thanking me for the investment. It’s enormously satisfying, even if it does ruin the natural splendor of this once-wild Scandinavian-esque landscape. The vistas in Death Stranding are astonishing, some of the most beautiful I’ve ever seen in a game, and it’s a shame to see them slowly cluttered with ugly ladders and roads. But hey, that’s progress.There are more opportunities to build on, and civilize, this land as the game continues. By the end, the world is unrecognizable from the untouched wilderness you first set out to explore and connect. It’s now a delivery man’s paradise, with every nook and cranny designed to make each shipment slightly easier. You are, quite literally, optimizing the world. Jeff Bezos would be thrilled.Interestingly, for a game that has a whole lot to say about politics, familial strife, and the nature of humanity, it never really comments on the potential downsides to this loss of natural beauty. Apparently it’s all great! I can’t really argue that, because thanks to progress, I now get to speed over those goddamn tar demons on my awesome highway. One could say that the satisfaction I felt upon building the road would have been dulled if I had reached that point sooner (i.e., without the game’s drawn-out, sloggy intro). Without the suffering, I might not have appreciated the end of that suffering. In short, is Death Stranding just giving me a bad case of Stockholm syndrome? Does it matter?Having been smitten by the core world-building gameplay of Death Stranding, I am stunned to realize that many of the game’s strongest, most appealing gameplay ideas (specifically the world-building and cooperation) are tossed aside in the final acts, in favor of a much more linear, scripted, cutscene-ridden experience. The freedom and sense of ownership I enjoyed while creating this world are dashed in favor of explaining and wrapping up a story that never had much going for it to begin with. The final 10 hours of Death Stranding are a slog, just like the first 10 hours, as my leash is tugged from emotional monologue to ridiculous boss fight to emotional monologue. While a few of these narrative threads make sense and land with some gravitas, others sound like the ramblings of someone on speed who thinks they’ve figured out how the universe works. Death Stranding feels like two games in one, designed for seemingly opposite audiences. One is a wholly unique open-world adventure with asynchronous cooperative multiplayer that allows me to feel like I’m part of a community, building a world from scratch. And the other is a long, confusing, deeply strange movie. The former is pulling most of the weight, but they share equal screen time. And, like a steamer trunk full of sperm, it’s impossible to separate the good from the bad. It’s all in the same box. Death Stranding will be released Nov. 8 on PlayStation 4 and in summer 2020 on Windows PC. The game was reviewed using a final “retail” PS4 download code provided by Sony Interactive Entertainment.

In that unveiling, all we knew was that it starred a naked Norman Reedus, that there were babies, dead sea creatures, and weird floating people. Not a lot to go on, but given Kojima's long, weird history with the long, weird Metal Gear franchise, it was enough to get people talking excitedly about all the things it could possibly be.As time has gone on, and even as Kojima has said he himself does not fully understand the game, a clearer picture began to take shape, and now that it is here, we can say definitively what Death Stranding is. It is a third-person action game, with a heavier-than-usual de-emphasis on the ""action."" It is a game about exploration in which there isn't that much to discover. It is a game about America that takes place in a world that bears only minimal resemblance whatsoever to the country it's portraying. It is a game that takes, at minimum, 10-15 hours to actually become ""fun,"" and even then the definition of fun is one likely to vary wildly for its players. It is a Hideo Kojima game in which the story is the least appealing aspect of the whole endeavor. Ultimately, Death Stranding is a game that is unlike much else I've played before, and I'm not entirely sure if I want to play anything like it ever again.In Death Stranding, you play Sam Porter Bridges. He is named that because he is a porter, tasked with delivering things to the citizens of a fractured, post-apocalyptic America, and because he is a member of Bridges, an organization dedicated to, well, building bridges--both literal and metaphorical--to those people in order to reconnect the country. Sam is a reluctant hero in the grand Kojima tradition. He's on his own, wandering the country and avoiding human contact because of past trauma, until the last President, Bridget Strand, pleads with him in her dying moments to help bring the ""chiral network"" back online, and reunite the country.This network is powered by chiralium, the game's primary McGuffin. It's a magical element that all of the game's technology is based around, and also is related to the game's apocalypse. You see, there was the titular Death Stranding. The barrier between the world of the living and the world of the dead was breached. The dead, represented here as sludgy ghosts attached to umbilical cords, roam chunks of the world and consume human bodies, creating ""voidouts,"" which are basically ghost magic nuclear explosions. Also it rains time now, and if it touches you, it ages you and wrecks your equipment, which is bad.Anyway, the chiral network. It's the super internet, and in order to reconnect America, you need to hook up the remaining cities and stations to it. Equipped with your trusty BB--a literal baby in a jar (😲) that helps you detect sludge ghosts through its link to its stillmother (😐) and the world of the dead--you do this by delivering packages to all those places. Rhythmically, this game has more in common with something like the Truck Simulator games than your standard third-person action game. As a porter, you schlep boxes of medicine and video games and semen to and from all these different stations throughout the world. Initially, all you've got are your backpack and your feet. The more jobs you take on, the more ludicrous the stack of packages on your back gets, and if you surpass Sam's weight limit, balancing and moving him becomes far more challenging.Early on, this is a pain in the ass. You're constantly trying to navigate over rough terrain and through heavy patches of time rain and all you can do is hug the R2/L2 buttons to try to balance yourself. Eventually, you are given a variety of tools to make Sam's journeys more manageable. You start out with basic things like ladders and climbing ropes before graduating to portable, floating cargo trays and full-on trucks. Crafting all these tools takes small amounts of the various resources you'll find littered around the world, but even if you aren't looking to spend a lot of time building and placing things yourself, you may find that other players have been more than happy to do the work for you. Death Stranding includes an asynchronous online system that allows things built in other players' worlds to surface in yours. There are also straight up public works projects multiple players can contribute to, including whole highway builders that greatly mitigate the frustration of trying to navigate the world.See, without those highways, vehicles aren't very useful. Death Stranding's vision of America looks like a combination of the Norwegian fjords and the surface of Mars. Rocks and cliffs are everywhere, and it's on you to build bridges (of course), highways, and whatever else is necessary to traverse these spaces. And even when you do invest heavily into the game's version of Infrastructure Week, the time rain will degrade any structure in the world, and if you don't add resources to repair them, they'll disappear.In the opening hours, this doesn't matter as much because you're just on foot and hoofing it from place to place. When you finally get vehicles, using them mostly sucks because you're constantly driving into rocks. When you finally get highways you can build, it starts to feel a little like American Truck Simulator...if you had to craft the truck and the roads yourself. And then the game just kind of gives up on that infrastructure stuff and sends you off to the mountains to criss-cross huge, snow-deluged peaks that take a very long time to get around. And then it asks you to do that a bunch more until the game is essentially over.I have several issues with Death Stranding, and one of them is pacing. This is a very lumpy game. The opening hours are a slog of endless, precarious walking and a near-constant deluge of new systems being presented to you. Then it just kind of settles into a rhythm of deliveries and discovering new places to deliver to, mostly putting the story on the back-burner until you finish the extremely long third chapter. After that, the A Hideo Kojima Production part of the game suddenly wakes up and you find yourself inundated with more cutscenes and character exposition than you'll ever know what to do with. The early hours have the feel of a child excitedly explaining to you the elaborate fantasy world they just came up with, and then the middle feels like the deep breath they take before launching into all the reasons why things are the way they are in that world. The last hour and change of the game is basically one long run-on sentence that tries to tie up every remaining loose end where you don't really do anything at all except listen to it ramble on.Look, it's not like previous Kojima games haven't had pacing issues, but Death Stranding is the most egregious example of it. It's not nearly confident enough to just rely on the delivery aspect of the game as its main thrust, so it changes things up with combat and stealth sequences that never feel all that great. Early on, combat is something you mostly want to avoid. Human enemies consist of MULES, a group of ex-porters who have been driven insane by the chemical boost they get for receiving ""likes"" from making deliveries (helloooooooo social media commentary!). They are a nuisance who will come after your cargo, but thankfully you can mostly just beat them senseless with a few quick mashes of the square button. By the time they give you bola guns and stun bombs, they become comically easy to dispatch. BTs, the aforementioned sludge ghosts, need to be avoided until you learn how to make bullets and grenades from your own blood. If you do bump into one, you have to trudge your way through a pool of moaning tar bodies while mashing square to escape. If you fail, you get whisked away to a space some distance away and fight a giant tar animal, for reasons.To be absolutely clear: these parts of the game are never all that fun. They are not broken or really even difficult; they're merely an oft-tedious distraction. They're the thing you do that's most analogous to Kojima's previous works, but the fights are never very memorable. Whenever a BT section or boss fight cropped up, I often found myself annoyed that my delivery missions were being sidelined, and that is not something I expected to say about a game like this. If I enjoyed anything about playing Death Stranding, it was the moments of solitude I experienced as I wandered from place to place, the moments of quiet beauty as I crested some big hill to see a new city on the horizon. Death Stranding is a game that shines brightest when it's willing to get out of its own way and just let the player exist free of the constraints of its own narrative and need to intersperse its mundanity with middling action.About that narrative. This being a Kojima game, there is of course a cast of strange characters that exist alongside Sam, helping his mission or standing directly in his way. Each of these characters has some kind of ludicrous backstory that they will eventually explain to you in excruciating detail, even though most of them are literally named after the primary thing that defines their existence in the game. And there are significant sections of the game where everything grinds to a halt so that Kojima (by way of one of these supporting characters) can either explain at length what's going on with any of the myriad bizarre concepts built into the game's narrative, or delve into the latest Wikipedia article he somehow found a way to graft onto the game's plot. None of these inclusions should be surprising, because this is the way Kojima directs his games.What is surprising is just how flat the vast majority of it all falls. In the Metal Gear series, Kojima's goofy tangents and batshit character monologues felt, to me at least, like amusing digressions set against the series' action cinema bravado. That stuff doesn't come off as well in what is essentially his version of an Andrei Tarkovsky movie. Nothing is allowed to be all that mysterious, and the game constantly tips its hand regarding things that might be considered twists or surprises. Whether it's through monologues, in-game emails and interviews, or someone just flatly stating the premise of what's going on out loud as obviously as possible, very little in Death Stranding is allowed to exist without overwhelming explanation.There's also a surprising dearth of memorable characters. Norman Reedus' Sam is especially bland. In a way, he's the perfect video game protagonist, because nearly all he does is grunt and sigh. There's just not much personality to him, which is a bummer given how much time you spend with him throughout the game. The only actor who feels like they're truly on board with the weirdness of the whole thing is Mads Mikkelsen, who plays an otherworldly soldier wraith that pops up just often enough to remind you that Hideo Kojima used to make some games about war. He seems like he's relishing the role, which I can't quite say for most of the other actors involved. Actresses Lea Seydoux and Margaret Qualley do their best with some truly leaden dialogue, and Troy Baker at least tries to chew (or, more accurately, lick) some scenery as the deeply disappointing terrorist villain Higgs, who is named that because he thinks he's like the God particle, and frequently references video games because I guess someone in this game probably had to do that.Frustratingly, I kept waiting for Death Stranding to offer something to say, something to justify the amount of breath spent explaining its most obvious metaphors and motivations. Unfortunately, it never gets there. Its early game musings on human connectedness and the need to bring people together never evolves over the 50 hours you'll spend playing it. The things it says at the beginning are pretty much the same things it's saying at the end, and none of those things are all that deep.Even more frustratingly, there were multiple times during the course of my time spent playing Death Stranding that I could see the strands of a game I'd really like. There are individual pieces of the game that I think work well. It's gorgeous, for one thing, offering up a well-realized world with wonderfully unusual looking technology and terrific animation work. And there were times when I found myself genuinely lost in the experience of wandering that world, lugging gear from place to place, building roads and liking ladders and just drinking in the loneliness of it all. Even the massive pile of different systems all feel like they mostly work together in a way that's harmonious.But the whole of the game never achieves that balance. There's a deep thread of insecurity that runs through it, one that manifests in its unwillingness to commit all the way to the arduousness of its main character's task, that's too willing to break that quietness with mediocre action, and that never trusts the player to understand even its most basic ideas without hitting them over the head with them. There is a weirdo, avant spirit to Death Stranding that I do admire, but that spirit fails to carry the game anywhere worthwhile.At least now we know what the hell Death Stranding is: a disappointment.The CHAMP and Jan are here to deliver news on The Last of Us Part 1 PC port, EA layoffs, PSVR2 reports, and more!© 2023 GIANT BOMB, A FANDOM COMPANY.

Death Stranding,Heather Alexandra,Kotaku,https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-the-kotaku-review-1839474313,"There is no elevator pitch for Death Stranding. Every inch of Death Stranding teems with meaning or implication. Even the stupidest and most pretentious developments build to create a multi-layered game, one with numerous potential points of attack to analyze. It is a story about fatherhood. It is a broad dig at the gig economy. It is deeply concerned with upcoming environmental disaster and American politics, old and new.Death Stranding is also about throwing grenades made from your own piss and shit at ghosts. It is about hiking alone in the wilderness for hours. It is a tireless grind. It is a commentary on social media and the internet, delivered through the asynchronous interactions players can have with one another as they play. It is breathtaking in scope, consistently intelligent in design, and beautiful to behold. It is a heaping pile of pretentious nonsense. It is a game in which characters drop overwrought interpretations of Kōbō Abe quotes. Its most recurring visual motif is a not-so-subtle gesture towards Thomas Pynchon’s Gravity’s Rainbow. It progresses not with the quiet stroke of a pen but with the pounding crash of a hammer. “I brought you a metaphor,” one of the characters says late in the game. It is stupid, and obvious, and perfect.""I want my BB.""UPS but spooky and political and stuff.Building mechanics strongly communicate themes, actors give it their all, hiking is both difficult and relaxing. Wow, this game!Long length, most story is backloaded to the end.Kojima ProductionsPlayStation 4 (played,) PC eventuallyNovember 8, 2019Completed the story in about 85 hours. I've played over a hundred total at this point.Death Stranding is also Hideo Kojima’s first major project following his departure from Konami in 2015. The context is charged: here is a widely acclaimed “auteur,” supposedly shackled by corporate overlords let loose at last, ready to blow your mind open with a masterpiece. The game follows on the heels of the tragic cancelation of Silent Hills, which was to be a video game collaboration with film director Guillermo del Toro, starring Norman Reedus. (Reedus now stars in Death Stranding, along with del Toro and tons of other celebrities.)Then there’s the supposed weirdness of Death Stranding itself. During development, its plot and gameplay were tightly guarded secrets, with exorbitant and celebrity-laden trailers providing the only hint of what was to come. The game has been mythologized through its marketing, and Kojima—already considered a legend—has been further mythologized along with it.But that narrative is replete with mischaracterizations. Kojima is a man with a highly skilled team at his disposal, decades of experience, celebrity friends, and millions of dollars in Sony backing. He’s no scrappier than any other rich and famous person. Because of this, there are two Death Strandings. There is the one in public consciousness, and there is the one that I have played. The first is a dream, an impossible (and frankly unnecessary) vindication of games as art created by a glorified mastermind. The actual game is a fantastic mess.But is it good, Heather? Yes, friends. I love it.Death Stranding is set in an alternate future where a cataclysmic event called the Death Stranding has devastated most of the world. The incident, described as a great explosion, has blurred the lines between the land of the living and the afterlife. In the world of Death Stranding, there is in fact something after death, and it is observable and measurable. Furthermore, every person has been discovered to contain their own “Beach,” which is a limbo-like space that they arrive at before finally moving into the great beyond. The thinning boundaries between our world and the afterlife released spirits called “beached things,” or BTs. BTs ravage communities, wreaking havoc on the living. They are so dangerous that if a human makes contact with a larger BT, it can trigger an event called a “voidout,” a sort of miniature nuclear explosion that can destroy cities in the blink of an eye. The world has been fractured into a few remaining cities and pioneer outposts. Connecting them are delivery services, staffed by porters who brave the expansive waste and sneak through BT territory to bring essential supplies to the disjointed smattering of humanity that remains.Players control Sam Porter Bridges, a lone wolf courier who is more content in the wasteland than around other people. After the last living president of the United States passes away, Sam is asked to carry out her final directive: connect the remaining settlements to the “chiral network,” a futuristic internet that allows for instant communication and fast 3D printing of infrastructure and supplies. The goal, he is told, is to “make America whole again.”Carrying out this directive becomes ever more complicated as terrorist factions conspire to kickstart mankind’s extinction, politicians cover up horrible crimes, and a literal ghost bent on revenge wages a personal war against those who wronged him. It’s operatic, excessive, and ultimately leads to a finale so spectacular and absurd that it moves beyond anime overindulgence into a glorious pimple popping of plot.So, there are grand political machinations that extend far beyond Sam’s reach. But throughout it all, he’s still just a postman who needs to make his deliveries while living in the worst possible world. To help him navigate that world, Sam is given a “bridge baby.” This baby in a pod grants Sam the ability to perceive BTs and progress on his journey across the continent. Throughout the journey, he will deliver countless packages and supplies from outpost to outpost, hiking untold miles in solitude while slowly bringing settlements into the network. Each new excursion is dogged by tough terrain, lurking BTs, raiders, and a corrosive rain called “timefall” that rapidly accelerates everything it touches.Most of the time, Sam navigates these dangers while wearing a backpack crammed with packages and gear. The contents of the backpack must be balanced. If Sam’s too heavy on either side, he’ll fall. And if Sam falls, his cargo will be damaged. It is painful to traverse terrain and all too easy to fall, especially in the early game. But over time, Sam gets stronger, and the player gains more resources.At first, Sam’s gear is little more than a good pair of shoes and maybe a rope for climbing. As players progress, they’ll gain access to a variety of robotic rigs to increase how much Sam can carry or how fast he can move in extreme terrain. Eventually, that means portable 3D printers than can build bridges or even safe houses to rest at provided you have enough raw materials.It costs a lot of materials to build a bridge or a shelter. These structures also take damage over time and must be repaired. But you aren’t the only one in this world who is building bridges over coursing rivers, or hanging ziplines in rocky mountaintops. Death Stranding will put you on a server with other players, each of them building their own structures that you can share and use. You can even deliver packages that they’ve dropped, or leave behind packages you can’t deliver yourself. Every time Sam connects another town in the world to the fictional chiral network, Death Stranding will connect you to the real-life network of other players and their structures.Sharing is rewarded. These structures exist in a pseudo-social network where players can “like” those that they find useful. The more “likes” you get, the better. It contributes to a progression system that uses a variety of criteria—mission completion time, the size of a cargo haul, completion of special conditions—to increase a player rank that eventually gives rewards, like the ability to carry more items or run down slopes without slipping as much.But it’s not just delivering packages, building bridges, and connecting people to one another. Eventually, Sam gets weapons: rifles, shotguns, and grenades, all made using Sam’s blood and other bodily fluids. Because Sam is special, you see. He’s a “repatriate,” which means that instead of dying in mortal situations, he is able to guide his soul back to his body and rise again to complete the job. This makes him a perfect candidate for tough deliveries. His bodily fluids can be weaponized against the BTs as well, especially his blood. A “hematic” grenade can dispose of a BT in an instant, while blood-soaked bullets can slowly perforate them into mist. The best option is to avoid BTs altogether, relying on Sam’s bridge baby to perceive the ghosts’ locations and sneaking past them.Death Stranding pulls from a variety of sources. The resurrections and multiplayer aspects of Dark Souls, the wandering of Proteus and No Man’s Sky, the clumsy body movements of QWOP, the skeletal remains of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain and more surprisingly Metal Gear Survive. These pieces come together into a unique package with a simple loop: you start here, now please go there. Pick a mission, grab your gear, figure out how to get there, climb over whatever mountain is in your way without losing all your cargo. Fall, get up, keep going. Rinse and repeat, with added layers of intrigue and combat challenges as the story progresses.The larger narrative of Death Stranding is spellbinding, but like The Phantom Pain before it, Death Stranding speaks more clearly through its systems, and is more interesting to play than its raw narrative is to experience. Using the game’s system of shared building and messaging, it’s possible to warn fellow players of BT hunting grounds, leave garages stocked with vehicles to freely use, drop shoes and excess gear into shared storage lockers, and create complicated pathways through a treacherous game world. The word strand, we are told early in the game, refers both to a tie that connects something and the act of being stranded, isolated from others. Just as Metal Gear Solid V’s war micromanaging expressed the endless cost of mercenary violence and revenge, Death Stranding’s systems speak to these two interpretations. Initially, players are indeed stranded. They are alone in a game world with few signs of human interaction, then slowly but surely, the topography changes. Footsteps on a path, the start of a road. These span out to form a complex spider’s web of player structures. Every piece feeds into the other. It turns out having ladders, better shoes, and increased mobility matters a lot when you might stumble over the perfectly placed rock at any moment.Eventually, I reached a particularly treacherous part of the game where most of my deliveries involved hiking through thick snowfall. A few players had braved this area before me, but I found many of their structures to be incomplete. A makeshift series of magnetic ziplines covered some peaks, but there were no connecting ziplines on the most obvious paths. The foundation of a more complex system was there; all it needed was some work to become the thing it could be. Instead of progressing forward with the story, I gathered the materials I needed and ventured through BT territory to place the required ziplines, ones that could allow travel over the most dangerous areas, the areas that Death Stranding clearly expected players to pass through.It was not easy. Time and time again, I was dragged to the ground by shadowy ghosts and pulled into a stream of tar that rushed me away from my destination. I fired bullets coated in my own blood and threw grenades containing my sweat at massive beasts until I somehow managed to get where I wanted to go. Over the course of several hours, digital blood and sweat literally spent, multiple hikes through the worst conditions accomplished, I connected my ziplines with the broader network. Anyone who came after me would be able to use them, crossing over the mountains easily and flying over the BT’s feasting ground. I’m proud of those ziplines, of the work that went into making them. I’m thankful to the strangers whose devices I literally connected with to make something that would benefit not only us, but everyone who stumbled through the treacherous paths after us. There was no real point to doing this, other that it could be done and I thought it should be done. I needed to do it. I needed to build something.During my time reviewing Death Stranding, I had a relationship fall into disrepair. That my most valued personal connection frayed while playing a game that is ultimately about the bonds we make was not lost to me. Time and time again in Death Stranding, I wandered through harsh red deserts and snow-capped peaks with the mission of bringing people together. I crossed bridges left by strangers, trusting that the paths they had laid would bring me where I needed to go. Outside of the game, I was lost. What does it mean for a connection to unravel, like an old rope bridge across a ravine? What does it take to rebuild one?I don’t have answers to this. Death Stranding didn’t provide them. Instead, it insisted on a simple idea: that we are made strong by the grace and, more beautifully, the chance of others. That we travel on the roads of those who went before us, leaving our own marks that ultimately affect the path those behind us take. We walk alone more often than we walk together, losing ineffable things along the way like so much fumbled luggage. And yet, we sometimes see signs of care. In life, they’re small. A random text message from an old friend, a free drink at the neighborhood bar, an enthusiastic conversation with a co-worker about nothing important, the sound of your roommate playing his guitar. In Death Stranding, these things are literal. A generator powering our car in the middle of nowhere, a glowing thumbs up emblem at the city gates, a ladder crossing a flowing stream, a structure protecting us from the acid rain.“I brought you a metaphor.” Death Stranding’s multiplayer aspects function as both criticism of online parasocial relationships and a strong metaphor for themes of togetherness and worker solidarity. Crossing the lonely wasteland encourages players to build narratives in their minds. Stumbling upon new bridges and seeing the names of familiar players, it’s easy to believe you know something about them. I noted how one player seemed to place their structures in areas with heavy foot traffic, maximizing “likes.” Another always seemed a step ahead, building exactly what was needed with care and consideration. You build affection for some players, annoyance for others. The opportunists, the caregivers. You crave “likes” and engagement because it feels good to have something, anything in the wasteland. One time, I built the start of a highway outside of a distribution center and woke up to find the road had been expanded by someone else. My initial structure has thousands of likes. Later on, returning to it, someone else’s name was presented as the owner and they had even more praise than I’d received. Who was this asshole, swooping in to take implicit responsibility for something I had built? I bet he’s the kind of person who steals people’s jokes on Twitter. These thoughts are, of course, nonsense. There’s no more sense to our interaction than whatever meaning I brought to it. Yet I cannot help but believe I know who they are, and accept that they’ve undoubtedly formed their own thoughts about me.In practice, building structures and expanding pathways creates more camaraderie than contention. There’s no denying the strange narrative context underpinning it all⁠—we were, after all, extending from coast to coast in an effort to make America whole again⁠—but the effect of these mechanics is more romantic than unfortunate. Countless workers, united in the solidarity of their task, creating public and functional means to allow essential services to continue. The work mattered enough that players had each other’s backs and tended to the essential parts without prompting. Death Stranding waxes poetic about intertwining souls and bonds that last from one world to the next. If love, sadness or duty could move from the land of the living to the dead, then perhaps these feelings of pride and solidarity can shift from the digital to the actual. We made something; we helped each other. Video game or not, there’s a comfort in that. It turns out that being an Amazon worker in the apocalypse isn’t so bad when solidarity prevails.The larger world of Death Stranding is far from idyllic. Scattered throughout the broken continent are pockets of hoarders know as MULEs, as well as other terrorists, all of whom are eager to steal Sam’s cargo. These human adversaries provide a different challenge from BTs. If you want to pilfer MULE supplies or rob caches from terrorists, you still can engage in some stealth action, as you would with BTs. High grass and natural obstacles provide plenty of means for ingress, and gear like a bola gun and rope to tie up enemies let you incapacitate foes. The other option is loud and hectic, and just as worthwhile. With the right arsenal, it’s possible to descend upon an enemy camp like a marauding archangel, firing away with non-lethal rounds—killing a human would produce a BT, after all—and causing frantic firefights that reward prize resources and gear.This is the most obvious vestige of Metal Gear Solid’s DNA. While Death Stranding is not an action game, it does handle action well when needed. This extends to boss fights, which I cannot spoil here except to say that they range from stealth guerilla affairs to biblical clashes that would feel right at home in Yoko Taro’s Drakengard. Violence is a last resort, and Death Stranding is best experienced in a careful and stealthy fashion, but when the time comes for the silence to break and explosions to ring out, it’s powerful. Not everything can be solved with a bridge. Combat is a hard truth, and one that always feels dirty and messy.All of this is work. Death Stranding is a long and grueling game, but that grind and sweat is fundamentally important to its identity. After the initial plot is set up, the next 40 to 50 hours are devoted to quiet hikes and desperate forays with only a few plot punctuations. In Death Stranding, labor is key, and offering any convenience to the player outside of a few weapons and gadgets would rub against the game’s themes. If players are meant to value connections, they need to be alone for hours.I did have a constant companion in these journeys: my friend and colleague Tim Rogers. We have talked for hours in his darkened office, chatted relentlessly over Slack messages. Plenty of it was goofing for goofs’ sake but when the time came for us to think about the world design, Tim spoke clearly.“Games build excitement out of parts a filmmaker would edit,” he told me.I can think of the moment that was most clear to me. Multiple hours spent in snowy mountains assembling underappreciated ziplines and shelters had taken its toll. I was playing a portion of Death Stranding that was miserable, which gave me the harshest environment and robbed me of essential tools. Cold lapped at my face, steel girders popped out of the snow like massive crucifixes. For two nights, all I knew was snow and acid rot. All I knew was white. Then I came over a ridge and saw green again. Glorious, growing grass. I wish I had the words to describe what it meant to see the color green again. It wouldn’t have mattered nearly as much if I didn’t put in all that goddamn work beforehand. I don’t think you can do that with a montage or smash cut.For all of Kojima’s pretensions as a would-be filmmaker, for all of the celebrity casting and cameos from his famous friends, not to mention the corniness of the Monster Energy Drink brand deal (drinking the stuff in-game will fill your stamina gauge), the glue that holds everything together is how well Death Stranding works as a game. While a majority of the time is spent wandering, it’s never pointless, and even the emptier interactions⁠—what does it even mean to “like” a stranger, anyway?⁠—contribute to a whole that is always asking you to consider something. That can be the uncomfortable implications of American expansionism, the current era of Trumpism, the disastrous effects of climate change, the vapid but reassuring nature of social media, the raw physicality of bodies, or broader notions of labor. It’s all there, and it’s wrapped into a game that is both hard work and rewarding to play.The strongest story in Death Stranding is the one told by its systems, but the cut-scenes and other narrative elements are still captivating, a slow burn that starts with quiet character moments and ends with a mountain-high pile-up of plots and motivations. Death Stranding takes a long time to define its world, and still leaves plenty to implication when the credits roll. There’s a lore database for learning some terms, but Death Stranding comfortably luxuriates in ambiguity before exploding outward into excessive action. Buried under all of the sci-fi terminology is a simple story; once everyone’s motivations have been laid bare, it’s not nearly as complicated one might imagine based on the game’s bizarre trailers. Death Stranding is ultimately more impressive in the raw sensory overload than in the moment to moment plot, but it’s hard to deny how much of an improvement its storytelling technique is when compared to Metal Gear Solid V’s lumbering monologues and swooping camera movements. Death Stranding, for all its convolution and visual excess, is evocative and often moving.Much of this is owed to how much the actors commit to their roles, even if they’re often tasked with spouting overwrought metaphors or clumsy exposition dumps. There’s a sense that everyone knows this is a little bullshit, and that winking edge comes hand in hand with a larger commitment to the story as a whole. It’s more like watching opera or musical theater than a film. At times, its tone comes off more like a sentai show or B-movie, schlocky and sometimes sleazy. There are grand gestures, deep outpourings of emotion, deliberate choreography.It’s hard not to like Sam Bridges, who faces all of Death Stranding’s bizarreness with a welcome everyman’s weariness, encapsulated  in Norman Reedus’ characteristic growl. Troy Baker hams it up as the villainous Higgs, and Léa Seydoux nails the mixture of toughness and raw emotionality as Sam’s close ally ‘Fragile.” Then there’s Mads Mikkelsen, who commands attention every time he’s on screen. Yeah, it’s funny as hell to hear him whisper “I want my BB,” but when the time comes, he puts in the damn work.Death Stranding sometimes falls into reductive gender tropes, in much the same way that other Kojima games do. This is a story of fatherhood, very often to the expense of the women in the cast. Sam’s ongoing bond with his bridge baby intersects with the story of Mads Mikkelsen’s mysterious villain Cliff, underpinning the main plot’s world-shaking politics with more human and relatable sentiments. But Death Stranding stumbles when the time comes to handle the women and their stories. There are gestures at motherhood themes to go along with the fatherhood themes, such as a storyline that uses ghosts as metaphor for postpartum depression, but this is ultimately a story about men, and one where even the bravest sacrifices of the female characters come hand in hand with the same characteristic leering camerawork of Kojima’s previous games. It’s never so gross as Metal Gear Solid V’s Quiet, but it’s still a noticeable issue that undercuts the narrative’s larger examination of parental pain and sacrifice.That said, Death Stranding is also just as infatuated with the male body. Whether that’s the sensual framing of Mikkelsen smoking a cigarette or the way the camera moves to ensure you’ve seen just enough of Reedus’ naked body during shower scenes, Death Stranding’s bisexual camera is more interested in men than even the torture-laden, blood licking Metal Gear franchise. The difference is ultimately in how lovingly men are framed compared to women, both by the literal camera and also their place in the larger narrative. Fragile’s body can be marred by timefall, rain lapping at her skin, but it’s still ultimately Léa Seydoux running in the rain as the camera focuses on her ass. Reedus stands naked on a beach, and Mikkelsen rises out of a tar pit, and yeah, it’s sexy, but they’re also allowed far more nobility.Death Stranding deals with many universal themes—children and their guardians, death, labor—but it is also speaking to more specific current topics as well. At the forefront is a deeply environmentalist sentiment about deteriorating habitats, extreme weather, and societal collapse. As reports flood in about our mounting climate crisis and the resulting cost of inaction, Death Stranding imagines a world where the most extreme conditions fracture the ties that bind the world together. This is evident in the world design, which ranges from rocky shoals and more reasonable terrain to extremely alien topography. There are portions of the map that look more like Mars than Earth, nearly blood red in the color of the sands. Raging snowstorms warp space-time, and sunken cities lurk beneath rising tides of tars.Death Stranding’s conflict rises to biblical proportions. Many characters believe that humanity is doomed no matter what, that any action forestalling imminent extinction is a band-aid on a mortal wound. After all, with enough time, there’s no doubt that humanity will be little more than dust. Death Stranding has an undercurrent of fatalism that feels very much of the moment. Even as other characters maintain a hope that a better, sustainable future is possible, there is also a quiet acceptance that, you know, maybe we really are struggling in the face of something too big. That the little victories we find might be dwarfed by the larger problems we face. This is never offered as an excuse for idleness; it is clear there is work to do, despite it all. Death Stranding pulls between these two extremes. One that says there is no point. Another that says although the future is unknowable, there’s a duty to fight for something better, even as the sun grows hot, the bodies pile, and world cracks.This message comes paired with gestures towards modern American politics. “Make America whole again” is the common refrain. In Death Stranding, America is a nation broken, scattered to disparate pockets of people just trying to get by, beset by monsters and marauders. The solution to this issue is suitably quixotic: what if we just fix communication lines between everyone? It’s an idea that doesn’t grapple with some of the more pressing questions of modern American politics—for instance, civil resistance—and one that can seem naive. The fracturing of real-life America is a symptom of a larger systemic problem of bigotry that’s seen a rise in violence and isolationist rhetoric around the world. In the face of this moment, Death Stranding decides that this is fixable. That the politics of division can give way into something more holistic and inclusive. Death Stranding, to its detriment, never quite reckons with its use of American iconography—it is a nation founded on slavery and colonial slaughter—but it still opts to point a finger. Things as they are cannot stand or they will lead to ruin.The silver lining, of course, is other people. Death Stranding is not a subtle game. The mechanics are the message. Build connections, use those to literally span divides. Even as the story swells to a convoluted chaos that would make Metal Gear Solid 4’s monstrous canon-welding blush, Death Stranding’s most fundamental point is not hard to understand. Yes, this is hell. Yes, we are falling apart. Yes, this might be the end. But there is redemption in other people. "
Death Stranding,Kat Bailey,USgamer,https://www.usgamer.net/articles/death-stranding-review,"Death Stranding is out now on PC, complete with graphical improvements and some PC exclusive content like wearable Half-Life headcrabs. You can read our original review below. Hideo Kojima has always been fascinated by attrition: Tapping Circle through the pain in Metal Gear Solid's torture scene, Solid Snake gasping as he crawls through MGS 4’s oven hallway, the extended ladder sequence of MGS 3, and the uncomfortably long jeep ride with Skull Face in MGS 5. Death Stranding is his attempt at capturing that feeling, effort as a mechanic, and selling it as an entire game. The results are mixed.Death Stranding is a video game about the spaces in-between. A cataclysmic event has severed the balance between life and death. The dead appear to the living, dragging them into another dimension known as the Beach, and the people who brave this terrifying world are forced to use Bridge Babies (or BBs) to sense them. These unborn babies are encased in an artificial womb - not dead, but not quite alive, existing in their own purgatory, too. Schrödinger’s tot.It’s also quite literally about the spaces in-between - the large swathes of landscape you travel across. Where most video games are built around what you do when you reach your destination - absentmindedly pushing forward on a stick or revving a vehicle to a destination - here the journey is the game, not the shooting people when you get there. It took 22 hours of playing Death Stranding before even I fired my first proper gun.




Watch on YouTube    
Since we got that very first trailer, people have been asking what Death Stranding actually is. Is it a stealth game? Sometimes. Is it an action game? Occasionally. For the most part, Death Stranding is a mountaineering game. Kojima has been talking up the online aspect - where structures created by other players appear in your world and vice versa (thank you, Captaindongs, for the bridge) - but it’s in the traversal where the game really does feel different. While there’s the odd boss fight and small pockets of combat scattered throughout, the majority of this huge 40-60 hour game is spent walking, planning, and creating infrastructure to make subsequent journeys easier.You take control of Sam Bridges (Norman Reedus) as he attempts to spread chiral network (spooky internet) coverage across America, travelling from the east coast to the west. You go to a terminal, accept a job, and stack up cargo on your back and limbs. You stack as much as you can carry without toppling over like a human Jenga tower, then you head out into the weirdly Icelandic USA. Between jobs, you kick it in a private room and take showers, pull faces in a mirror, and drink Monster Energy. Sometimes you see Norman Reedus’s full ass. Sometimes he winks at the camera. Sometimes you take a shit and an advert for Reedus’s AMC motorbike show pops up on the shower curtain. Why do you take a shit? Because the game turns your shit, piss, and sweat into different types of grenades. The poo one? EX Grenade Number Two, obviously.Hideo Kojima, a man in his 50s who once tweeted about his eggs looking like boobs, is known for having a puerile sense of humour, and that remains intact. One area that has improved here is in his portrayal of women. Yes, they might have daft names, but there is not a single whiff of tit. Progression! If it wasn’t for Troy Baker’s character, Higgs, occasionally licking peoples’ faces and, at one point, slapping Lindsey Wagner’s arse, it’d be a flawless victory.Let’s talk about those silly names for a moment. Heartman? He’s a guy who has a heart attack every 21 minutes. Die-Hardman? He hasn’t died once. Deadman is made of dead people, obviously. You idiot. Mama? She’s got a ghost baby. I was half expecting Mads Mikkelsen’s character, Cliff, to be made of rock. Death Stranding wields metaphor like a cudgel and beats you over the head with it. Sam Bridges, the man who’s travelling the world to connect people, has aphenphosmphobia - the fear of being touched. That’s just, like, so deep, man. Let me take another hit on this bong.For the most part, the story is overly complex nonsense. It’s a game of telling, not showing, where characters will stand and talk at you for full 30 minute stretches. In the opening three hours, you’re in control for a mere 30 minutes. At the end, there are back-to-back cutscenes that rival MGS 4’s ending. It goes back to attrition again, but this time it’s your attention span and not your stamina that’s being tested. The pre-release trailers and the discussion around them were ultimately far more interesting than what’s here, story-wise.When the cutscenes and endless exposition get out of the way, though, there’s an interesting, beautiful, unique, unfortunately repetitive game here. It’s a game I’m glad exists, even though I’m not entirely enamoured with it. Remember how MGS 5 had a secret cutscene that would only trigger if every single player in the entire world decided to get rid of their nukes in the online mode? It’s a continuation of that idea, with every action you make potentially impacting another player in their own journey. Before I give you an example, let me explain the basic mechanics.As mentioned, you stack yourself up with cargo. Depending on how you stack it, your weight shifts, though there’s an option to auto-optimise all cargo so you’ll just use that every time because why wouldn’t you? Sometimes you just need to get it from A to B. Sometimes you need to do it in a time limit. Sometimes there are further restrictions, such as carrying it by hand (manually keeping a trigger squeezed to keep hold), or keeping it flat. One side mission sees you literally delivering a pizza while it’s still hot and flat. You’re basically a Deliveroo employee at the end of the world.Once you’ve figured out how you want your cargo, you head off into the landscape. Like I said earlier, it’s Icelandic - the end credits show that they shot on location in Iceland - but it’s meant to be the US. It bears no resemblance at all to the US, except for how fractured it is and how it only takes 22 hours to get a gun. There are rivers to cross, mountains to pass, and basalt to trundle across. Different surfaces affect your balance in different ways, and it’s about finding the optimal route while maintaining your center of gravity. Take on too steep a slope and you’ll slip, damaging your cargo and traumatising Schrödinger’s tot in the process.You can actually plot your route by bringing up your map and drawing it out. Later, you can predict weather patterns such as wind and timefall - also known as rain, except this ages things and fucks up your cargo with prolonged exposure... a bit like a Hermes driver. You also have to decide whether you want to try to pass over obstacles - mountains, enemy camps, and more - or take an indirect, safer route. Often, this depends on the tools you have. If you have enough climbing anchors and extendable ladders, a mountain can be tamed. It’s that famous video game marketing line again: “You see that mountain over there? It’s a prick.”One huge river at the base of a waterfall was my personal nemesis. I had to clamber down a cliffside to reach it and it seemed impassable. I couldn’t build a bridge over it because I hadn’t extended the network that far yet, so I had to try to find another way around, ultimately scaling an almost sheer cliff to bypass it. Later, I came back to the river with zipline structures and built an easy way across, both for me and for any weary traveller who might come up against what I just suffered through.Once you make it to the end of a mission, you get rated for the route you took, the time it took you to complete, and the state of the cargo. You also accrue a currency called ‘likes’ through your endeavours, both from NPCs and other players who use your structures and vehicles. Similarly to social media ‘likes’, these don’t actually seem to serve any worth whatsoever, but they do make you feel warm and fuzzy inside. The rating system is similarly pointless, though occasionally it doles out some incremental upgrades to things such as balance and likes received. Unfortunately, there are a few occasions in the story where the rating system bumps up against the human drama - there’s nothing quite like getting an S Rank for incinerating a loved one.When you’re driving along a road you’ve built, or firing yourself through the air in a series of linked up sci-fi ziplines, Death Stranding nails its objective. You are rewarded for your patience, planning, and foresight. The issue is, the reward is the ability to skip the core gameplay as much as possible, to automate the walking through well-laid equipment. Later, you can even use robots to cover minor deliveries for you, too. It feels like it is building up to a big payoff towards the end, but it completely undermines itself once it gets there. Once you reach the west coast, you’re forced to head back east again. Only now, timefall storms have ruined all your equipment. Instead of this being an opportunity to marvel at your work and trace a route back through it, it’s just a 50 minute slog back to the other side of the map in a single mission.Death Stranding does have its moments, though. Because it’s mostly walking around a vast environment while listening to Hideo Kojima’s Spotify playlist, action sequences are extremely tense when they do happen. One of the main bands of enemies are Mules. These were Deliveroo drivers like you once, but they forgot the reason they were doing it and now they just steal shit and deliver it to themselves. They have beacons dotted around their camps that ping your cargo, then they head out in a van to mess you up.Combat is a simple, one button affair, though you can also launch luggage at peoples’ faces. Most of the time, it’s best to try to escape. In one such encounter, I ran through a wheat field like a Tory, dodging electrical spears as they rained in, escaping into a derelict barn up ahead. From there, I used a ladder to escape through the broken roof and dropped down behind them, stealing their vehicle and gunning it until its battery died. I’ve also crept into Mule camps and stolen cargo from under them, strangling dudes while concealed and using a harpoon gun to snatch goods away from distant tents. In the entire 44 hours I played, probably less than four of those hours were spent in action sequences like this.Elsewhere, you have to creep past the ghosts that appear in the rain, using your BB to sense them with a robotic arm attached to your suit. This is just a case of creeping slowly and changing direction as needed. Later, grenades and a melee stealth attack makes them almost pointless encounters - all the tension falls away. If you are grabbed, you enter a boss arena where you can throw grenades at an oil dog, oil whale, or oil squid while jumping over rooftops.At some specific story points, you’re whisked away to other places for exciting, one-off action sequences. These moments are huge standouts, but they come so late that I imagine a good portion of players would have fallen off by then. The same goes for some of the most interesting equipment - exoskeletons, a cargo carrier that you can ride like a snowboard, those ziplines, the harpoon gun, and more - which doesn’t come until you’re into the double digits.If you do manage to hold out, you will be rewarded with flashes of brilliance, it’s just that those flashes are buried as deep as the core story is buried in the endless dialogue. And as profound as it wants to be, this is still a game in which you can equip and unequip your penis so you can piss out Red Bull. The good stuff is waiting for you beyond that piss, beyond the shit grenades, beyond that Ride with Norman Reedus advert unceremoniously plastered into a game universe where I didn’t see a single television set. It’s just a test of attrition.Version tested: PS4 Pro. A review copy was kindly supplied by Sony. You're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!

Death Stranding is an anomaly in the video game industry. With AAA studios firmly entrenched, we seldom get to see a brand new studio like Kojima Productions get a blockbuster budget, A-list celebrity casting, and the backing of Sony for their first title. Of course, Hideo Kojima isn’t just any developer. He’s been involved in developing some of the most-lauded games in history throughout his 34-year career and is one of the most recognizable personalities in our industry. Death Stranding marks not only the new studio’s first production but also Kojima’s first game post-Konami.I’m not going to beat around the bush here. Death Stranding is a masterpiece. It melds the best of cinematic and gaming traditions to craft a country-spanning saga in a true epic. This is the pinnacle of gaming, and it feels like every title made before it was leading to Death Stranding. Some critics felt like Konami kept Kojima’s wilder ideas in check and that this game would be a disaster of half-baked concepts. If anything, Death Stranding is Kojima’s most cohesive game to date, and even though it does present a strange and at times, confusing scenario, by the end, everything makes sense. Despite the fantastical setting, its themes are very much grounded in the real world.Editor’s Note: Our embargo stated we could only cover story elements through Chapter 3 in our review. However, this review reflects our experience with the game in its entirety in general terms.The Death Stranding is a cataclysmic event that weakened the barrier between the world of the living and the dead. Much of humanity has been wiped out by the appearance of Beached Things (BTs). These creatures are the souls of the dead who have crossed over into our world. In addition to being invisible to a normal person, when a BT consumes a human body, it creates a voidout. These voidouts are a massive explosion that can be large enough to take out entire cities. This constant threat means that many large settlements have been wiped out without any warning. In addition to the danger of BTs, rain has turned into Timefall, which ages anything it touches. The hazards of the outside world mean that the remaining humans must cling to life in the remaining cities and shelters dotted throughout America, disconnected from each other.There does exist a small percentage of the population who display resistance to Timefall and who can sense the presence of BTs. You play as Sam Porter Bridges (Norman Reedus), one of these individuals. Sam, as his name suggests, is a porter, someone who delivers vital supplies between the remaining vestiges of society. As the nation’s infrastructure has collapsed, porters are essential to the survival of humanity, and Sam, in particular, is already lauded as one of the best when the game begins.Even though the United States of America has collapsed, some people wish to see the country reborn. Bridges is a company formed by the last President of the United States to reconnect the nation and establish the United Cities of America. Three years before the game begins, the foundations of this endeavor were laid by the first Bridges expedition. This group made it from the east to the west coast before separatists terrorists captured their leader, Amelie (Lindsay Wagner). Due to Sam’s prowess, and his relationship to the former president, he’s asked to complete the work of the first Bridges expedition. His mission is to network the cities and shelters of America to allow the new nation to be born.Along the way, a Bridge Baby (BB) acts as your partner. While Sam can sense BTs, he can’t see them and requires a connection to a BB to do so. These BBs are suspended between the world of the living and the dead as their mothers are brain dead. The environment in the pod simulates their mother’s womb. This tricks them into staying unborn, preserving the connection to their mother, and allows them to be portable without losing their ability to detect BTs. Sam and BB’s journey will have you learning the mysteries behind the Death Stranding and what it will take to save humankind from extinction.Sam’s overarching mission is to reconnect the splintered remnants of the former United States to form a new country, the United Cities of America. While the land between settlements is still fraught with danger and unclaimable at this time, the smattering of towns and individuals that remain have etched out a place where they can survive. However, to prosper, they need the benefits of the Chiral Network, which allows for the sharing of information at an instantaneous rate. It’s hoped that by uniting these disparate peoples with the network, that humanity can start to reclaim the knowledge they’ve lost as a result of the Death Stranding and prevent the extinction of our race.What makes Sam perfect for this job, besides having DOOMS and being a repatriate, is that he’s one of the best porters in the business. Since all logistical networks have broken down, all the cargo in the world of Death Stranding has to be shipped by hand. His previous experience means that Sam is already an expert at navigating the hazards of terrain and the threat of BTs. Of those available, he has the best chance of anyone of making it from the east coast to the west, connecting settlements on the way.Connecting places to the Chiral Network isn’t Sam’s only objective during Death Stranding. Bridges and the UCA have no qualms about putting him to work delivering essential goods as well. You’ll often find yourself carrying vital cargo in the course of the story since not many porters are confident enough to venture very far. As you connect the world and clear hazards, this changes, and you’ll see more of your porter comrades walking about delivering cargo.At its core, Death Stranding is about the threads that connect each of us. Each aspect of the game, be it the story, gameplay, or the Social Strand System, calls attention to the ties that bind us and the strength they give us. Kojima has stated the game is about the “rope” instead of the “stick.” It’s revolutionary in that it concentrates less on a traditional protagonist vs. antagonist plot structure and more on the aspects of connectivity and unity.Throughout the game, Sam’s journey reflects the larger picture. In the beginning, he has separated himself from the remains of society. His attitude and his Aphenphosmphobia (fear of being touched), reflect the world in which he lives. After the failure of the Bridges I expedition, the shattered nation lives in fear of Homo Demens. That terror manifests itself in many people as a reluctance to join the UCA. Through Sam’s hard work, these people start to realize the strength of togetherness, and through them, Sam begins to feel a connection to others as well.Death Stranding also examines the commoditization of people in the form of the Bridge Babies. In an early conversation with Deadman, we see that even though Bridges is altruistic, they fall into the trappings of seeing BBs as tools, not people. Sam’s growing affection towards his BB is warned off as being too sentimental. When Sam first receives his BB, it’s said to be behaving erratically and that most of them have to be “retired” after a year in service.The overriding message I took away from Death Stranding is that our connections make us who we are. Despite the pain, they can sometimes cause us; these strands between us are the source of our strength as a species. However, there’s a ton of allegory and subtext to decode in Death Stranding. This is the kind of game people will talk about for years as it will mean something a little different to everyone.Death Stranding sets a new bar in video game acting. With names like Norman Reedus (Sam), Mads Mikkelsen (Cliff), Guillermo del Toro (Deadman), Lea Seydoux (Fragile), Margaret Qualley (Mama), Lindsay Wagner (Bridget), and Nicolas Winding Refn (Heartman), this game might have the most traditional star power of any title to date. In addition to the prominent roles above, there are a ton of cameos in the game that will be a real treat for players.Where Death Stranding succeeds is that its cast meshes well. That might not have been the case, as Jesse Corti and Darren Jacobs do Del Toro and Refn’s vocals, respectively. Multiple actors per character lead to the complexities of having one actor mocap and another doing the lines. So, even though the main cast has Hollywood chops, the experience wasn’t what you’d get on a traditional sound stage. However, each scene comes off with the quality of a blockbuster. There’s not a weak performance in the bunch.Everyone did a fantastic job, but there are two actors I’d specifically like to acknowledge. Troy Baker is a veteran in the industry but is known primarily for voiceovers. In Death Stranding, he is the mocap actor, face, and voice for Higgs, one of the game’s main antagonists. Baker has done a tremendous job in his myriad of past roles, but I’m thrilled that Kojima gave him a chance to be the face, not just the voice of Higgs. He makes for a great villain, and there’s a ton of nuance in his performance that brings out the motivation and history of the character.The second performance that stuck out was that of Tommie Earl Jenkins as Die-Hardman. I can’t go into detail, but there’s one scene with him in this game that is mindblowing. I’d put it up against the best that cinema has to offer. You’ll know it when you see it, and I hope you get as much out of it as I did.One thing I do fear is that Norman Reedus won’t get enough credit for his role as Sam. Reedus is perfect for the role. Despite the similarities in tone, he’s not just playing Daryl Dixon again. Sam is a man of few words. Still, there’s just enough dialogue on his end to let the character blossom without causing too much of a disconnect with the player. My advice is to watch Reedus’ movement in cutscenes. While Reedus expertly delivers the dialog, his facial expressions and body language add a lot to the character and speak to his skills as an actor.You could describe the main gameplay in Death Stranding as the fetch quest taken to its pinnacle. After all, that’s what you do. You take item(s) from one place and deliver them to another. Players typically pan fetch quests severely, but I argue the quests themselves aren’t the problem most of the time. Instead, players hate fetch quests in a lot of games because of the context. In Death Stranding, you’re a porter; it’s your job to deliver packages. The post-apocalyptical framing gives you the necessary motivation to enjoy taking on orders and delivering cargo.Of course, it’s not quite as simple as just taking a box from one place to another. There are multiple mechanics in play that you have to take into account. Sam can only hold a certain weight. Some packages are fragile, have to remain cold, must be delivered in a certain amount of time, or must be kept upright. Terrain, BTs, and human enemies stand as obstacles. Sam has stamina and health that you have to regulate. All these things come together to make the simple idea of taking a box from one place to another compelling.Luckily, there are plenty of things that help you stack the odds of a successful delivery more on your side. Powered exoskeletons will help you lift more and preserve stamina at the expense of having a limited battery life. You’ll also gain access to vehicles like reverse trikes, which are nimble and quick, and trucks, which can haul massive amounts of cargo, but handle like a Ford Econoline.Delivering packages brings people into the fold of Bridges and the UCA. The more you provide to them, the stronger your connection will become, and they’ll help you with items and perks. To complete the game, you only have to do the essential, story-based deliveries. However, you also have the choice to take on standard deliveries, which will help you develop those connections. It’s great that the game lets you enjoy it at your own pace. The story is the main attraction here, but you’re free at several points to do your own thing.While the BTs, MULEs, and Homo Demens terrorists serve as conscious protagonists, your biggest enemy is the environment itself. Throughout Death Stranding, you’ll be carrying large amounts of cargo through untamed lands. The differing terrain and obstacles make every delivery a sort of puzzle. You have to take into account elevation, obstacles, and distance with each job you take on, and the varied landscape keeps you on your toes from beginning to end.Careful examination of your route is a must in Death Stranding. In the beginning, you have to get cargo from point A to point B with no strings attached. The routing tools in the game make setting up waypoints easy, and the map is 3D, so you can get a picture of how much elevation will change along your path. A straight line is seldom the best way to your target, so getting a handle on the terrain in your area of operation is a must to be a successful porter.If your load is light, you may want to try a direct approach to your goal. You can use ladders and rope to ascend and descend from height and forge a path where none is obviously available. The more cargo you stack on Sam, though, the harder the journey becomes. If you’ve loaded down with heavy materials, you’ll find that Sam’s balance may be too shaky to attempt a mountainous crossing. In this case, you’ll want to use your map and routing tools to plot a relatively flat course.Of course, the whole thing is made more difficult by the existence of Timefall, and the need to avoid BTs and human foes. When navigating areas with Timefall, your cargo takes steady damage, so the route that’s safest for your health isn’t always the safest for your delivery. This dynamic becomes even more complicated when you start getting specialty cargo. Some items that you’re asked to port have unique qualifiers that make your journey more difficult. For example, you’ll encounter medicine that you have to deliver within a time limit, fragile cargo that takes damage more rapidly, and some packages have even more strict requirements.Of course, as deliveries become more tricky, you’ll get more tools to help even the odds. Your first significant upgrade comes with the Power Skeleton, an exosuit that dramatically increases the amount you can carry and helps Sam keep balanced. Vehicles are available that help your mobility and cargo capacity tremendously. However, due to the foreboding terrain of the broken world, you’ll find the going tough if you try and motor your way everywhere.One of the best aspects of Death Stranding is its freedom. Despite all the qualifiers above, you’re free to try and carry your cargo however you desire. The game is reminiscent of Breath of the Wild in that if you see it, you can more than likely scale it. If you want to try and climb, ladder, and rappel your way down the highest mountain, you can give it a shot. You might not be successful, but you might also find a quicker route to your objective.Death Stranding‘s environmental design excels in organically creating challenges through its landscape. The need to balance avoiding danger with keeping your cargo intact makes each delivery interesting. The environments vary throughout the game and keep you from getting bored of any particular geographical layout. Few game worlds are as expansive as the one found here while also remaining dynamic enough for the long distances between settlements and points of interest to not feel like filler.The land isn’t the only foe you have to deal with in Death Stranding. Your most dangerous enemies are BTs, which can appear in areas where it’s raining. Through your BB and Odrarek radar, you can detect the normally invisible Gazer BTs, allowing you to either sneak past them or fight them. As long as you stay quiet and keep your distance, Gazers aren’t too hard to slip by. Once they detect you, though, they’ll begin pursuit. They’re quick, but you still have a chance to avoid them if you keep an eye on the handprints that mark their tracks, hold your breath, and quietly move away.However, if a BT grabs you, it will cover the ground in a tar-like substance and summon help to try and pull you in. If you get pulled in, it’ll drag you to an arena-type location where you’ll have to fight a large BT. If you win this fight, the Timefall in the area will stop, and you can continue on your way. If it eats you, it’ll cause a voidout explosion that will render the surrounding area impassable. This obstacle can make already tricky navigation even harder and will destroy any cargo caught up in the blast.As always, humanity is divided, and you’ll face plenty of opposition from people in addition to BTs. These enemies primarily take the form of MULEs, ex-porters who have become addicted to the rush of the delivery and who steal cargo to sate their appetites. These individuals don’t kill, but they will attack you and attempt to take your cargo.Death Stranding encourages a non-lethal playthrough. Not only is it seen as immoral to kill MULEs because they’re suffering from mental illness, but a dead body creates an immediate and tremendous threat. When people die, left alone, they necrotize and become BTs. Even more dangerous is when a BT comes in contact with a dead body. This contact can create a massive void out which can level an entire city. The one true game over state in Death Stranding occurs when a non-repatriate (anyone but Sam in practice) dies, and the body comes in contact with a BT. The resulting detonation is enough to wipe out vast swathes of the map, which means you automatically fail in your mission to reunite America and establish the UCA.However, this game is about freedom, so you can utilize lethal force against other humans. If you do so, you’ll need to use an incinerator to burn the body before a BT can come in contact with it, or it can necrotize. A trip to the incinerator usually involves a considerable detour, and it drives home the consequences of taking a life.The multiplayer aspect of Death Stranding is like nothing seen before. It’s simple in concept, but revolutionary in execution and bridges the divide between single-player and multiplayer games. When you enter a region for the first time, you’re on your own, but as soon as you connect it to the Chiral Network, something amazing happens.In regions connected to the Chiral Network, you’ll see the handiwork of other players appear. You’ll see roads start to form in places that multiple players have passed through and be able to take advantage of structures that have been built by those who passed through before you. You can leave signs to warn other players of BTs or show some encouragement. All of this happens asynchronously. While other players never actually appear physically in your game, you can go through all of Death Stranding and see the path others have taken.The effect the Social Strand System has on your game is compelling. For example, ziplines can be used to traverse the world quickly. However, you must place them within 300 meters of each other. To build a path using these ziplines takes a lot of time and resources, so by yourself, it would be a colossal chore to set them up. However, by utilizing other players’ ziplines, you can much more easily fill in the blanks and create a vast network that speeds up travel tremendously.It’s this feeling of working together that makes the Social Strand System so amazing. People can pitch in resources to upgrade structures or rebuild a derelict highway network. It plays into the game’s theme of social connectivity and makes the whole world feel much more dynamic. Players can even reward each other with likes to show their appreciation of a particular sign or structure. It pushes you to look at what you’re doing in the game with a broader scope. I found myself building things or placing ladders and anchors in places I thought it would help people the most instead of just plopping them down wherever.I can see the Social Strand System being something that gets widely copied. While Death Stranding is ostensibly a single-player game, it adds that social dynamic that solo gaming typically lacks. Of course, you can turn the whole thing off if you choose and play the game entirely alone. However, it’s one of the unique aspects of Death Stranding, so I encourage everyone to give it a shot.We’re coming up on the end of the eighth generation of consoles, and we’re starting to see them pushed to their limits. I played mainly on a PS4 Pro on a 55-inch LG B8P OLED TV, and I found performance to be excellent. The game seems to target 30 fps and hits its mark 95% of the time. I did notice some slowdown in areas with a lot of player-generated structures during Timefall storms. It never gets super chopping, but you can tell the PS4 Pro is having a hard time with it. I also tested the game on a base model PS4 at 1080p and didn’t notice any massive drop in quality. Framerate on the base PS4 kept up with its big brother, and the game maintained much of its graphical allure.Death Stranding is a beautiful game. The terrain, models, textures, and effects are all top-notch. As the game is (currently) a PlayStation exclusive, you can tell the team was able to optimize it to use the PS4’s strengths and negate its weaknesses. I did find the use of fog to be a bit overwhelming at times, but there is a story-based reason for it (Timefall), which keeps it from being too jarring. I also didn’t notice much texture pop-in, which is surprising as you can get up to a pretty good clip on the reverse trike. I figured when I topped out on the trike, I’d start to get that muddy look you get when the PS4 can’t load the high-res stuff fast enough, but I was pleasantly surprised.The soundtrack for Death Stranding has been hyped, and for good reason. The melancholy sound of Low Roar punctuates some of the games more poignant moments, and other big names like Major Lazer contributed as well. However, I’m not sure if this is just a problem I had, or it’s widespread, but when a song would pop on, it would be almost too low to hear. I played on a 5.1 surround sound system and messed around with the settings both in-game and on my A/V receiver to try and fix the issue. However, I never did find the right balance to be able to hear the music during those moments without the other sound effects blasting my eardrums.One of the things that make Death Stranding is so impressive is just how well done it is as a whole. Everything fits together to create a fantastic experience, and no one aspect detracts from another.Each element feeds into the overall theme of connectivity. The story, the gameplay loop of deliveries, the Social Strand System, all of these reinforce the central idea that each of the strands that ties us together gives us strength. The genius of Kojima comes through in little aspects like the fact that a major story element is what encourages non-lethal combat (reinforcing the rope vs. stick themes) and not just some arbitrary rule.Death Stranding‘s excellence is due in part to its cohesion. Everything about it makes sense in the context of the game’s world. There’s no weird, out of place mechanics that take you out of the experience. There are no microtransactions, herding you towards making a purchase. It’s a whole game, meaning there’s nothing that needs added or taken away to get the most enjoyment possible.All the above being said, there’s going to be people who don’t enjoy the product placement. Sam’s beverage of choice is Monster energy drink. He keeps a canteen that can filter any water in the game into Monster. He keeps Monster cans in his private room. There’s a lot of Monster here. Also, there’s some ad placement for Ride with Norman Reedus.I thought the product placement brought a bit of levity to the game. Having a Ride with Norman Reedus ad pop up on the bathroom door when Sam goes #2, complete with motorcycle noises, had me rolling the first time I saw it. The idea of Sam chugging Monster out of a canteen to refill his stamina is hilarious. That’s me, though. I think it’s done in a way that’s kind of like the part in Wayne’s World. It’s not subtle, but it’s not intrusive either. The game gets it out of the way early and does so in a manner that lets you get a few chuckles and probably helped out Kojima Productions. After all, even though Kojima is an industry legend, this is the studio’s first game. That production money has to come from somewhere.I also really appreciated how considerate the game is of your time. Death Stranding is a long game, and a story-only completion will take you roughly 30 hours if you throw the blinders on and power your way through. The available side content is entirely optional, and you can ignore it if you choose. If you decide only to take on the story content, you’ll be missing out on equipment that will make the game more enjoyable. You’ll also miss some of the backstory you get in emails and reports received by strengthening connection levels and seeking out memory chips. I’d rate a 100% completion would put you at around the 90-hour mark. I’ve personally put in 80 hours, and I’m still doing the last few things to platinum the game. Even after all that time, I’m still enjoying the ride.Death Stranding is one of the best games I’ve ever played. It’s smart, it’s well-produced, and it just feels good to play. It’s damn cool. I don’t think any other game made me think to myself, “Damn, that was powerful,” as many times as Death Stranding did. Sure, there’s a lot of games that have some point to make. I don’t want to downplay anyone else’s work. However, Death Stranding will get you thinking about some stuff. I’ve played through it twice, and there are still things I’m turning around in my head.It’s always struck me as weird that people look down on games as some “lesser” form of entertainment than books, TV, or movies. Death Stranding stands defiantly in the face of that attitude, and I’d put its story against anything that’s come out in the last decade. Sam’s journey is a true epic that spans the whole country, and it inspires the hell out of me.If there’s one game you should play this year, it’s Death Stranding. It’s a system seller, and I love it.10Jason Faulkner is the Senior Editor of Game Revolution and PlayStation LifeStyle.

Death Stranding,Chris Carter,Destructoid,https://www.destructoid.com/review-death-stranding-568760.phtml,"darkIt’s nigh impossible to do justice to Death Stranding in just a few paragraphs. You’ve seen the promos, the famous faces, the web of intrigue spun by industry veteran Hideo Kojima; and either checked in or checked out of this hotel of madness.So let’s try to understand it together with a full review, shall we?Death Stranding (PC, PS4 [reviewed])Developer: Kojima ProductionsPublisher: SonyReleased: November 8, 2019 (PS4) / Summer 2020 (PC)MSRP: $59.99One of the first things you do in Death Stranding is enter your birthday, which allegedly impacts gameplay by influencing your “DOOMS” rating. Yes, this is a Hideo Kojima joint — strap in, if you haven’t already.While I’ll refrain from diving too deeply into the narrative, suffice to say there’s a quiet (ha) beauty to it amid all of the “delivery babies that spot shadow beasts” absurdity. It looks and sounds as damn fine as coffee on a PS4 Pro, with a rousing lead performance from Norman Reedus as professional “The Legend” delivery man, Sam Porter Bridges. That beauty isn’t so quiet on a technical level, as Kojima and his team have been toiling away for years with their Decima engine: it paid off.Not just in a “you can see the pores on the actor’s faces” kind of way that wowed everyone back in 2011 when L.A. Noire hit the scene, but in a meaningful fashion; with all the wild bells and whistles that go with something extracted from the mind of Kojima. I love Reedus’ grunting, raw, and primal delivery in nearly everything he does: Death Stranding included. Léa Seydoux is mesmerizing as “Fragile,” who has her name emblazoned all over her outfit just in case you forget her moniker. Hell, just about every cast member, big or small, feels essential to the experience and dedicated to their role. You haven’t lived until you’ve seen Mads Mikkelsen in a Santa hat shouting “ho ho ho!”Unless you’re a huge Kojima nut you probably came here for an actual gameplay discussion, so let’s go to it. No bullshitting around: you run about for most of the game as a postman in a quest to reunite America by reactivating internet terminals. You can scan for packages — that’s what the fancy arm-like radar thing does — jump, grab stuff, and occasionally fight.It doesn’t take an hour and a half to get started like some Metal Gear Solid games. You’re grabbing packages — and bodies — and confronting the main baddies (shadow things) very quickly. Your main job is to regulate Sam’s blood and stamina gauges, and not slip and slide down hills or off cliffs by bracing yourself with L2/R2, even with a comical amount of cargo on your back (I have trained for this my entire life). Oh and avoid those menacing “BTs” — horrifying creatures that you can’t clearly see that figuratively drag you to hell — plus human threats. No big deal.Much of Death Stranding is spent finding the best way to reach a destination (through arduous rivers and mountains), taking in the sights as you wait for another [good] bridge cutscene. No, there aren’t frequent boss fights, but they do exist and are pretty exhilarating, if not simplistic. No, everything isn’t fully explained in the end. Unless we get a sequel, that’s par for the course for Kojima — feel free to cheer or sigh here. Whether or not you’re okay with the whole “auteur” excuse, Death Stranding as a whole is a little too long (in all it’s about 30-50 hours, critical to 100%, respectively). I could have done without a large busywork section a little past the halfway mark (in which you need to wait until your baby is fully operational again by doing required side missions), and in some cases, the map is slightly too sprawling for how little there is to do in a few zones. It can be exhausting and should be a red flag for a certain kind of person, but in my case, never to the point of giving up.The way the delivery concept works is a bit weird and clunky, but fun in the sense that you can fully customize how you want to approach the game. Sam can strap anything he wants to his back, but it can get really silly when you need to carry critical mission objectives. It’s actually more efficient to place items like ladders, anchors, weapons, grenades, and other trinkets onto your body directly like a Transformer, or on vehicles. Sam can carry two shoulder items, two pieces of gear on his thigh, an exoskeleton (with various bonuses like higher capacity loads, speed, or terrain control), gloves, and several backpack-like pockets.You can manually do this every time you come across a new item or take another quest, or click an auto-optimization button, it’s your choice. Yes, there is a dedicated urination option — which directly impacts a lore-based concept — and weapons like traditional lethal and non-lethal weaponry, though guns don’t come into play until roughly halfway in. Eventually you can unlock fast travel and use light hand-to-hand combat that doesn’t even remotely resemble something like CQC. It’s esoteric, but in the end a very traditional action-adventure in many respects.Of course there’s cinematic flair in-between all that walking and plenty of existential dread. There’s a lot of tension in this completely new, unique world, especially since you can hear the unsettling voice of the BB (the baby device on your person that helps detect BTs) through the DualShock 4 speaker, or the TV if that gets annoying. You really have to hand it to Kojima: even if you hate his games, they aren’t quite like anything else. Some don’t see him as the genius he’s now known as by his fanbase, but like David Lynch, his weirdness (and their fondness for toys as adult men) resonates with me directly.Speaking of, death is also a whole…thing in Death Stranding. I mean, it’s in the name. The first time I died was at the very beginning after an errant jump off a cliff. From there, I had to reunite with my body through a 30-second minigame. I know people are going to hate it: An artsy death world is a game mechanic and you are a postman. I want to make that absolutely crystal clear before someone claims I called this the next Metal Gear Solid. Tactical espionage action this is not.It can also be frustrating. Delivering packages will make you “very popular indeed” according to an early on-screen message, which tells you absolutely nothing about what that entails. There’s an in-game loading screen tip that explains three esoteric concepts all at once. Kojima also seems to be commenting on the current social landscape (he’s an Instagram fiend!), with “likes” being doled out for deliveries, and you can vaguely level-up, though completing critical missions and earning new blueprints for gear is far more impactful.There are so many menus and controls that it can get crazy. To jump into a structure submenu, you have to hold (not press) the options button until it shows up. Building structures is a very finicky venture, as you need to figure out the proper placement for it and have all of the required materials on hand. When placing a bridge is stressful, you know someone did something horribly right or horribly wrong depending on your point of view. This savagery has a point though with the game’s very light but welcome “we’re all in this together” multiplayer.You can create open-world signs for people to “like” or warn them of impending hazardous areas just like a lot of other modern action-adventure games, but Death Stranding takes it a step further. Bridges or other big structures can just show up in other worlds (or yours) because you or another player built them. You can reap the benefits of donated items in your mailbox from a community of other real players in a constantly connected asynchronous universe, which was live and very active even during the course of this review period. There is a limit on how many players can connect (and your entire real estate won’t be taken up by building after building), but I’ve always been matched up.I can’t count how many times my bacon has been saved by a player-built safehouse or a battery charging post that provided respite. The optional (you can play offline) community-driven idea propels the game forward in a way, but the world itself isn’t a complete mystery.There is a good amount of exposition that straight-up tells you how the universe works. Concepts like aphenphosmphobia are a lot easier to relate to than “La-li-lu-le-lo,” as a full layer of political intrigue is chopped off in favor of a more human angle. Kojima also hasn’t lost sight of his cinematic roots, providing four levels of difficulty, including “very easy,” which I’ll transcribe right now: “Recommended for those with little or no action game experience. Gameplay at this difficulty is only very mildly challenging, allowing almost anyone to make it to the end of the story.” Emphasis mine! What a subtle dunk. As usual I forged ahead on normal mode, but at any point, you can swap. Accessibility!Death Stranding is not the overly-strange inaccessible walled garden the marketing has made it out to be. It’s weird, don’t get me wrong! But anyone with a surface-level understanding of surrealism in art should be able to acclimate to what is essentially a playable Hollywood production.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]GreatImpressive efforts with a few noticeable problems holding them back. Won't astound everyone, but is worth your time and cash.

Login NowHideo Kojima's latest game is a dazzling work of art that redefines what video games can accomplish. Our review.I’ve been dreading writing this review ever since I jumped into Death Stranding.I’m certainly not disappointed, and I don’t have bad news. I just don't think Death Stranding is the type of game that you can truly do justice by evaluating it as if it were just another run-of-the-mill shooter or bland indie platformer. I don’t think it’s fair to compare it to “blockbuster” releases pumped out by studios primarily interested in rushing out their next iteration year after year. Talking about Death Stranding requires a much different approach, and an understanding that many games don’t ask of their players. It feels like it’s on another level entirely, one that many developers haven’t reached or simply won’t.With that said, Death Stranding isn’t for everyone, but at the same time it’s about everyone. It’s about finding deeper connections that bring us all together and figuring out ways to honor them. I know it won’t resonate with everyone the way that it did me, but it doesn’t need to. It stands alone as one of the most unique titles I’ve ever played, and I feel truly richer for the experience of having played it.For those who want me to shut up and cut to the chase, yes. It’s that good. Yes, you’re probably going to think it’s “weird.” Sit down. I’ve got a lot to say.The narrative really isn’t as complicated as everyone has made it out to be based on the glimpses we’ve had through trailers up until now. It’s quite straightforward, actually. You are Sam Porter Bridges, and your job is exactly what your name implies: a porter, or a glorified delivery person. Porters are tasked with hand-delivering cargo to a now-fractured America. Following a mysterious event known as the Death Stranding, society is now a mere shell of its former self. As a member of the organization Bridges, lead by President Bridget Strand, Sam is an invaluable part of the efforts being made to make the country whole again – or at least some semblance of it, as the United Cities of America.But this isn’t about a symbolic connection. Your job is to literally connect people living in every corner of the country to the chiral network, which is similar to the internet, but a more evolved, instantaneous method of communication. This enables everyone to readily get in touch with each other, as they’re separated miles apart, at least some of them. It also allows them to utilize items known as chiral printers to create materials they may otherwise not have access to. There are some individuals who don’t believe in Bridges, the UCA, or the chiral network. Too bad. You’ll have to change their minds eventually. Keep delivering cargo to them, and eventually they’ll come around.Of course, there are several more layers to this narrative that I’m going to purposefully leave out so as not to spoil anything beyond what you’re able to ascertain from the trailers and other marketing materials. I’m bound by a very strict embargo, so I’m actually unable to speak about what happens past Chapter 3 (and there are several chapters.) The story is the most sacred part of Death Stranding, and something you should be able to watch unfold on your own – but just know that when you start playing and seeing all the scenes from the previously obtuse trailers happening in correct chronological order, you’ll know exactly what’s going on.That’s what I love so much about the story, in fact. It’s never misleading or confusing, always feeding you just the right amount of information until everything clicks. There’s also plenty of supplemental reading to be found in the massive amount of mail Sam can receive during the game. He’ll get notes from everyone, riddled with fun emoji and teeming with useful information.Some characters offer hints at where you can find certain items. Others offer additional insight into some of the peculiarities of the world, with some interesting surprises and hints at further lore reveals that Kojima may see fit to speak more on in the future. Many want to say thank you for helping them get connected to the chiral network or for consistently offering awesome delivery service.While Sam is the only playable character you’ll see out in the field (the rest are NPC porters), he’s not alone in his mission. He’s assisted by Die-Hardman (portrayed by Tommie Earl Jenkins), Deadman (portrayed by Guillermo del Toro and voiced by Jesse Corti), Heartman (portrayed by Nicolas Winding Refn and voiced by Darren Jacobs), Fragile (Lea Seydoux), and Mama (Margaret Qualley). Each individual comes with their own fleshed-out back story and narrative with unique personalities and quirks that let their actors’ expressions and voices truly shine through.What I can say about the narrative, ultimately, is this: if it were a film, it’d be an Oscar contender. It will make you giggle occasionally, continuously wipe tears away, become enraged, and fill you with wonder, sometimes all at once. There are gruesome sights you won’t want to see. But there are beautiful sights that make it all worthwhile in the end. Bottom line: Whatever you think you know about it, you don’t know the half of it.You’re always actively participating in Death Stranding’s narrative. Sam's primary job is to traverse the landscape, connecting private citizens and settlements to the chiral network. It's a straightforward enough task, but a monumental one all the same.To do this, Sam must travel (mostly on foot at first, with vehicles later) to various settlements across the country. In the beginning, he travels light, but as you amass cargo he becomes more and more encumbered, to the point where you need to keep him from swaying (using the controller’s shoulder buttons and leaning into the direction of his movement) as he walks across the landscape. Sam’s extremely resilient, and super strong as it is, though. You’d be amazed at how much he can carry. You can load him down with boxes and boxes of cargo, and even when overloaded he takes it all like a champ, much more so than any regular human being. Of course, you can still give him too much to carry. This will cause him to creep forward, nearly buckling under the weight of his cargo. That’s why you have to be smart about what you carry.You need only carry essential cargo while completing orders, but you can also pick up optional missions along the way. When you’re carrying so many deliveries, you have to be creative about where Sam puts his items. He can attach them to his pack, stack them on his back, or even carry them by hand. While you can customize where you put certain items, I found that having the game optimize how Sam carried his items was the easiest and most beneficial way to ensure he didn’t keep teetering as he traveled.When you get your items together and set out on your delivery, you have a few tools at your disposal to ensure you don’t wreck your cargo and receive the best grade possible from each recipient, who will grade you and often give you an item for your time. That’s where things get interesting.Sam is equipped with a baby in an artificial womb-like device known as a BB Pod. You need BB because the world, following the death stranding event, is now riddled with bizarre, ghost-like beings found throughout certain areas. They’re called BTs, or “beached things.” Sam cannot see them, but using his BB and his scanner known as an odradek, he can scan for them (as well as receive information on the terrain around him.) You’ll know when they’re about to appear, because they only hang out in areas where timefall is currently occurring. Timefall, punctuated by an inverted rainbow, is a kind of rain that ages everything it touches. Sam is protected by his suit, but his cargo isn’t – so that’s another thing you have to watch in addition to BTs showing up.If one appears, it’s in your best interest to continue scanning, walk slowly, and even have Sam hold his breath. Because if they spot you, they’ll reach out with their ghostly hands and try to drag you down into their world (a beach), where you’ll have to face off against larger BTs. And if you happen to die, Sam is taken to the Seam.The Seam is a world from which Sam can “repatriate,” or come back to life. The process is a precarious one, because sometimes you don’t have to fear dying, but being swallowed by a BT. Should you be pulled down into the BT’s beach world and a larger BT manages to consume you, an event known as a voidout will occur. Essentially, this means an enormous crater will appear in your world – corpses left to necrotize will turn into BTs, disappear, and then cause said voidouts. It’s the same with Sam. There won’t be any corpses left over in the craters afterward, but there will be massive holes in the world after they occur.There are also bandit-like characters called MULEs, who are obsessed with cargo. They’ll attack you with electric javelin-like weapons if they happen to spot you, and they’ll try to steal away anything you’re carrying. Basically, they’re an enormous pain, and the more you can avoid them, the better. If you get pinged by one and get on a MULE’s radar, you can usually lose them pretty easily by running away, but they’re still irritating.Luckily, you have plenty of ways to fight back against these malevolent forces. Sam can wriggle away and push away BTs before it comes to combat, but when he’s forced to fight he can use hematic grenades, made from his very blood that happens to be BT-resistant thanks to an affliction he has called DOOMS. You also get other types of weaponry to defend yourself with, but a good portion of your offense will include arms like these grenades and those made out of Sam’s waste as well – yes, number one and number two. They’re very effective against BTs big and small.There are also ways for Sam to interact with the environment beyond fighting off BTs or staving off MULEs. You can spend time in hot springs that have regenerative properties and urinate in areas that aren't close to structures or other people. Doing so will result in the growth of a small mushroom when he's finished. The mushrooms don’t have any discernible function, though Kojima initially stated others would make them in their games and you’d be able to see them in yours. I don’t recall seeing any other mushrooms during my lengthy time with the game, oddly enough.You could also urinate on a BT if you want, which I tried out a few times. It wasn't as effective as the grenades made out of Sam's waste, of course, but it did affect enemies enough to help me get my bearings by slowing them down a bit. I'm glad there wasn't more focus placed on this aspect, because that's all anyone could focus on to begin with, just another testament to how juvenile people can get when faced with something that takes them out of the comfort zone like this game does.There’s so much to do that I honestly feel that, even with this exhaustive overview, I’m only scratching the surface of just how complex all of the game’s interconnected systems are, as you’ll see when you dive into the game. Perhaps the most daunting thing about it all is that you have to manage all of these things all while caring for BB and soothing it as if it were a real baby. It gets cranky when you go through all these ordeals, and you’ll often have a crying baby on your hands if you don’t take the time to be a good “parent.”While this could be annoying at times, you don't really have to do much to soothe BB. When it cries, you do need to cradle the BB Pod and slowly move the controller back and forth to rock it back to sleep. However, it's only really a problem after Sam takes a tumble or you face BTs in a fight. Most of the time, BB is satisfied to gurgle happily and even give Sam ""likes."" As someone who detests children, I found it really cute. It’s easy to get attached to BB, and you’ll form an emotional bond with it quickly despite many characters’ encouragement to see it as more of a tool than a living being.Then again, if you just don’t want to hear BB crying and don’t care about dealing with BTs, you can always let it cry and cry until it becomes autotoxemic – essentially non-functional – and it won’t make noise anymore until you’re forced to return to a private shelter and rest. BB won’t help you find BTs while autotoxemic, but that’s one way of not listening to its cries, if you’re an actual monster or something like that.Making deliveries isn’t as easy as just figuring out the best way to carry everything on your way and then avoiding the dangers on your path. You also need to plot a course to your destination, which is a huge part of completing each delivery recipient’s order. You have a map and markers to follow so you can travel in a general direction, but otherwise the path you take to a location is ultimately up to you.If you see a location you'd like to travel to, so long as you have the proper equipment and patience, you can go there. Granted, it might wear out more than a few pairs of boots (which you do have to carry and swap out if they get too worn), and BB might be a little fussy, but you can do it. In some open world games, you can go everywhere and do basically anything, but the story may not always be strong enough to push you to want to, or even care to. Here, you know you can traverse that ridiculously steep hill because you have to see what happens in the next city. You never know what surprise revelation is waiting around the corner.Eventually, you may even find that there’s a much better or more efficient way to travel once you proceed further through the game, especially when using others’ structures that they’ve created during their playthroughs. That’s all thanks to everyone else who takes the time in-game to help assist by investing their own time and materials for everyone else.Death Stranding’s multiplayer mode is one that can affect your world, too. You’ll see other players’ structures like bridges, ropes, timefall shelters, and electric chargers dotting the landscape. You can stop by and use these as you see fit and award their creators likes.Likes are an important form of social currency, but you don’t use them to purchase anything. Instead, they contribute to the most intriguing and altruistic version of multiplayer gaming I’ve ever seen. There aren’t satisfying rewards for playing through the game without helping others. You’re always encouraged to stop by and tap the touchpad on the DualShock 4 controller and “smash” that like button, so to speak. Likes can help raise your social standing and your porter ranking, which ultimately can help you raise your stats.So you’re driven to help and be helped by others. This may mean putting a sign out where BTs are found, contributing materials to build a bridge over a particularly tiresome body of water, or creating a highway that runs through the central city areas. In my game, many of us had built a network of roads that made it so much easier to get from one area to the next, and that kind of collaboration felt so meaningful.A quiet beauty permeates every single area of Death Stranding. There are moments where you simply must take a step back and appreciate the allure of the world surrounding you. Snowy cliffs, cascading waterfalls, and lush greenery are in view as far as the eye can see. The game isn’t marred by dirt browns and boring grays. It’s vibrant, alive, and beautifully wild in a way that makes you feel as though you’re really there instead of playing along at home.I was especially impressed by just how detailed each character was, particularly Sam and Die-Hardman. Visuals aside, the voice cast assembled for the game is outstanding. Of course you have the celebrity cast mentioned earlier in the review standing in to lend their talents to the game. Though Norman Reedus does an exceptional job as Sam, I was blown away by Tommie Earl Jenkins’ performance throughout the game, as he displayed range and believable emotion that drastically changed my opinion of the character throughout. Troy Baker also played a believable grouse in the form of the Southern leader of Homo Demens, Higgs. This time, he was mo-capped using his own likeness instead of only providing his voice, as he’s typically known for. I honestly don’t have a single bad thing to say about the voice cast, which is a rarity when it comes to many video game productions.There isn’t much ambient music to be found in-game. In fact, most of your journeys are pretty quiet, save for key moments during your treks where music from ambient artist Low Roar play, or a select few other artists. There's a sense of longing and isolation that leaks into every part of the game. When you're not hearing chatter from characters, music blaring from other players’ structures, the MULEs' odd rock guitar alert riff, or BB's nervous cooing, the rush of a new song from Low Roar is a surprising but welcome one.There were times when I was chugging along, Sam loaded down with cargo, when a song crept up out of nowhere and I became emotional. There wasn't anything significant happening at that point in the game, as I was just entering a city, but I was awash with feelings. These musical moments happen all throughout the narrative, with one in particular that reduced me to a sobbing mess. I can't speak on the circumstances surrounding it, but it was the moment I was acutely aware of just how much the musical cues of Death Stranding amplified its emotional effects. It may not be immediately obvious, but music is a massively important part of the game, and I was pleased to see how it was used to great effect here.I was hard-pressed to think of any real complaints I had about my journey through this veritable masterpiece, and when I sat down to map them out, they seemed frivolous. For instance, I found it somewhat disappointing that the entirety of Death Stranding's landscape that was meant to be America didn't really look like America at all, and instead resembled Iceland, which I know the map was inspired by. I would have appreciated a bit more clues that this was once the America I know such as additional dilapidated buildings, but in the grand scheme of things, this doesn't matter much. Looking back now, it felt more like traversing Iceland, but who’s to say the futuristic America before the death stranding didn’t turn out to look that beautiful?There were some small issues I did have, though. When traversing higher mountains, Sam would hit what felt like an “invisible wall” where he couldn’t continue climbing and he’d slide to the bottom, dropping all his cargo in the process. It would happen in areas that didn’t feel like they should have been gated off, so perhaps these were bugs. It wasn’t fun picking everything I had dropped back up or losing progress while climbing a mountain.Sometimes, I also found that when hopping into vehicles and zooming along the terrain, I’d occasionally get stuck without a way to move the truck. This forced me to abandon it when I didn’t want to do so. I also hated being made to leave a nice, new truck right where it could be destroyed by timefall, but that was more of a personal preference than a flaw with the game. Very small problems, but problems nevertheless.I’m sad, honestly, to see Death Stranding greeting the public for the first time. I don’t want to read the “hot takes,” the “Kojima must be on drugs” diatribes, or the clickbait about some of the late-stage content that feels inevitable. Death Stranding is the type of story that I want everyone to experience with an open mind, seeing it with eyes unclouded by cynicism or the condescension creators who take chances are often met with, and I don’t know that everyone will be ready for it.As selfish as it sounds, I wish I could keep it locked away from the general public a little while longer so I could continue to privately savor it. But that would go against Kojima’s wishes in the end, wouldn it? It’s ironic that a game all about bringing people together and forging connections makes me want to retreat even deeper in my shell, but here we are.To me, Death Stranding feels like being free. Free of the constraints developers place on themselves – they can’t do this, they can’t do that – and the boxes we place ourselves in. As such, I hold it in such high regard after completing the lengthy, moving journey that I find myself wanting to speak less and less about it so as not to ruin the magic. It’s simple to explain why you dislike something, but nigh-impossible to capture why something moves you in such a way that your eyes well up now after hearing any of Low Roar’s discography.This is one of the rare times I wish Hideo Kojima had created a lengthy film or a series instead of a video game. At least then people might not approach it with trepidation or with derision. You know how it goes: ""Oh, it's a video game. There's no way it can be that good.""This masterful journey reminded me exactly what gaming is capable of during a period in my life where I’ve become frustrated and jaded by my role within the industry and the way many things have evolved for the worse over the years. Unfortunately, something like this will only come around once every few years. Here’s hoping another death stranding event doesn’t occur between now and when I can take in Hideo Kojima’s next opus.For now, I’ll keep on keeping on.This review is based on a download code provided by the publisher.

					Glad it's good, was looking iffy				
					[deleted]				
					More review stuff. https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/dq0pey/death_stranding_review_thread/ Video from Danny: https://youtu.be/V2zTMzlK1BsVideo from GB: https://youtu.be/ltYRUvBiZ0k Sounds like a unique, but boring (gameplay-wise) game.				
					good review!				
					Thank you! I worked really hard on this, so I appreciate the kind words.				
					You somehow described a Kojima game in a way that made sense, that's an impressive feat! 				
					Well, I'm now sold on the game after reading that. Now to get a PS4.				
					If you can wait, it is coming to PC next year.				
					I'll probably end up doing that. My desktop is on the fritz and I've been too lazy and poor to fix it, but the two months in Thailand took care of the former and I should be starting work again soon so that would take care of the latter. It sucks having a giant 4K TV and no glorious PC Gaming Master Race content on it :-(				
					I cannot see myself ever enjoying a game built around the encumbrance mechanic that bogs down other games. The idea of balancing the stuff you're carrying doesn't sound like fun to me. Why do I want to carry anything for anyone? Why am I playing a game that is giving me almost literal chores? It's like Kojima is daring people to give him honest criticism, or like this is an Emperor has no clothes moment, but instead people are implying there is some depth there.   life is too short to play a purposefully tedious game for 40-50 hours.				
					also: making grenades out of your own shit and piss and throwing it at enemies? it feels like Kojima is mad at the audience who has supported him for decades. I retroactively feel dumb for being mad at Konami about firing Kojima and cancelling Silent Hills, but maybe it was for the best if this is the quality of ideas he is coming up with now.				
					Don't play it then? You'll be missing out, but to each their own.				
					I apologize if you took my response as a criticism of your review. Your review (and a bunch of others) have made me think this game is not for me. Is it wrong for me to say that? I am glad you liked the game, but you have to realize it's not gonna be for everyone yeah? Putting purposefully tedious gameplay?  His games have always had quirky elements, but imagine the meeting he had with Sony where he described the player using their own feces and urine as a weapon against the enemies in the game?  Imagine Andrew House or Shawn Layden listening to Kojima describe his intent to make a game where you make shit-grenades and throw your own piss at ghosts and then giving him millions of dollars. What in the world?!				
					I don't think you were criticizing the review. It's fine if you don't like it. But you haven't played it, so before judging it, you might decide to actually try it and see if it's for you first.  And it's not as if you literally throw feces and urine at BTs. That isn't what's happening at all. I can't explain much further without spoiling the game for you and breaking embargo, but trust me when I say that you've got the grenade part all wrong, at least how you're envisioning it. It's all very clean, medical, and story-purposed. It's not literal feces packed into a grenade.				
					Not every single thing is meant for every single person.  Not saying this defensively or anything, just don't play the game if you have no desire to do the stuff in the game.  I don't look at every Madden release and be like ""WHY should I throw this football though?"" I just don't buy/play Madden games.				
					Of course you’re right. But I loved Phantom Pain enough to buy it at full price and 100% it twice, so I’ve been looking forward to this for years.				
					[deleted]				
					Thank you for this review. I'm relieved, it sounds exactly what i've been waiting for.				"

Death Stranding is Hideo Kojima unleashed.That sentence carries a lot of weight in the video game universe, where solid personal branding and marketing across decades of Metal Gear titles means Kojima ranks as one of the rare game auteurs players actually know by name. And as much as Kojima used the Metal Gear games to defy both narrative and gameplay conventions, the series still represented a stealth-action box that Kojima found himself straining against over and over again.Death Stranding once again stands as a bold subversion of expectations from a creator known best for leaning into action heroics. For the vast majority of the game, your protagonist is not a Solid Snake-style hard-bitten action hero. He’s just a guy carrying a comically overloaded backpack across a lot of empty space, focused on a simple but necessary job, for better or worse.Death Stranding is Kojima’s escape, not just from Metal Gear’s cardboard box but also from the restrictions and recriminations of his former corporate parent Konami. That means the new game lets Kojima take some bold risks, experimenting with gameplay systems that are somehow utterly isolating and deeply connected to other players at the same time. It also means this is Kojima at his most self-indulgent, with a bloated, convoluted mess of a sci-fi story that’s heavy on complication and light on relatable human moments.It’s the near future, and America as it once was has been ravaged by a mysterious event referred to as the Death Stranding. For some reason, the barrier between the world of the living and the dead has been weakened, causing ethereal, usually-invisible-to-most creatures called BTs to roam the Earth. When a BT consumes a dead body, it causes a voidout that utterly destroys everything for a miles-wide radius.As if that wasn’t enough, BTs surround themselves with timefall, a form of rain that speeds up the flow of time significantly. Years of this timefall has destroyed the communications and transportation infrastructure that used to bind America together across its cities and towns. What remains of the US populace is holed up in remote, disconnected cities called KNOTs, where the populace cowers in fear, dependent on outside deliveries from brave couriers who can withstand the timefall and BTs.That's not a bad setup for a new post-apocalyptic universe, all in all. But Kojima can’t leave well enough alone, weighing down this somewhat solid premise with layer after layer of overcomplicated, semi-mystical sci-fi dreck. Simply explaining what’s going on practically requires consulting a glossary of new and bewildering terms.There are the stillborn bridge babies (BBs) that can let a human sense BTs when they’re connected through a sort of external womb. Except there are also some people who can inherently sense and/or control BTs through a power known as DOOMS (I never really figured out what this acronym stands for). And there are also some people who come back to life after they die, called repatriates, and their blood is apparently toxic to BTs.Then there are the Beaches, the mystical, personal planes that connect the world of the living and the dead. Everyone has their own private Beach, but they’re also all connected by personal and inanimate relationships, you see. Also some people can go back and forth to different Beaches with little effort. And sometimes people’s souls can be trapped on their Beach, ageless, even if their bodies stay in the real world. Got it?I’m not going to further belabor this review by explaining cryptobiotes, chiralium, the q-pid necklace, or any of the other new concepts that get thrown at the player with abandon throughout the game. Don’t worry, though, the game takes enormous pains to explain all of this and more in long, discursive cut scenes that go into excruciating detail about how all of these complications work.I’d estimate at least half of the game’s story scenes are taken up by deep-in-the-weeds theorizing about the history of the Death Stranding, or the metaphysical properties of BBs, or some other esoteric minutiae that doesn’t really affect anything. It’s as if Kojima barfed up an encyclopedia of background material for his apocalyptic fanfic before worrying if anyone was interested in the original story.Despite all that explaining, the world of Death Stranding never feels cohesive. There’s a strong sense that the writers are making this up as they go, forming a patchwork quilt of scientific-sounding magic that holds together only if you don’t look at it too closely. Even in the run-up to the game’s conclusion, characters are still introducing entirely new theoretical concepts that seem to come completely out of nowhere. Meanwhile, bits that are obviously intended to serve as mysterious twists fall flat thanks to horrible telegraphing and seemingly clueless characters.Without spoiling anything, I’ll note that Death Stranding’s ending is more or less a two-hour cut scene that tries to explain how the preceding 30+ hours are actually supposed to fit together… yet I still came away scratching my head about what the hell happened.Into this whole mess drops Sam Porter, a stoic and largely blank-slate courier who serves as the player avatar (we’ll get to talking about the gameplay soon, I swear). Sam can sense BTs and “repatriate” if he dies, so the dying president of the United States begs him to crisscross the country connecting cities in an Internet, but also magic, chiral network called the United Cities of America. Also, if he could deliver some packages along the way and save the president’s daughter who has been captured by terrorists on the West Coast, that would be grand. Thanks!While the game goes deep on its mystical technobabble, it seems remarkably unconcerned with the interesting questions of how society or government actually functions in this post-apocalyptic world. There’s a president, but she seems to serve as a cult-of-personality totem more than a real leader with power. We never get to see inside these shining KNOTs on a hill, which somehow seem able to operate with some extremely advanced technology despite the destruction of all existing infrastructure. We also don’t get to see inside the homes of the scattered preppers who somehow rode out the post-Death Stranding world outside of the KNOTs.Instead of holding up a twisted mirror to society, Kojima uses his sci-fi future as a means to let his characters pontificate in extremely direct and unsubtle grand philosophical statements, full of dramatic imagery and botched attempts at symbolism (and occasional memorable imagery). Most of these focus on the need for human connection, a blunt “we live in a society” statement writ large.“If we don’t come together again, humanity will not survive,” the president says in one characteristically unsubtle statement of the game’s core thesis. “Humans aren’t made to be alone,” another character says at one point, as if it was the most profound thing in the world. “They’re supposed to come together. To help one another.”The voice and motion capture cast does its best to give this material some life, soldiering on through countless “tell don’t show” diatribes that often focus on their characters’ own out-of-nowhere sci-fi powers. But there’s very little real human drama for the cast to hang their hats on; they're dealing with an excess of unnatural dialogue to fight through. When the game does attempt to dive into a character’s backstory or motivations, the result is almost always ridiculously overwrought, complete with swelling musical cues that try their best to evoke utterly unearned emotion through ridiculous circumstance.If you don’t think about it too hard, perhaps you can let the contrived pseudoscientific theories, pop philosophy, and overly direct symbolism wash over you. But if you’re hoping for a coherent, well-told plot full of relatable characters, you have to look elsewhere.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

Death Stranding,Kirk McKeand,VG247,https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/01/death-stranding-review/,"Death Stranding is out now on PC, complete with graphical improvements and some PC exclusive content like wearable Half-Life headcrabs. You can read our original review below. Hideo Kojima has always been fascinated by attrition: Tapping Circle through the pain in Metal Gear Solid's torture scene, Solid Snake gasping as he crawls through MGS 4’s oven hallway, the extended ladder sequence of MGS 3, and the uncomfortably long jeep ride with Skull Face in MGS 5. Death Stranding is his attempt at capturing that feeling, effort as a mechanic, and selling it as an entire game. The results are mixed.Death Stranding is a video game about the spaces in-between. A cataclysmic event has severed the balance between life and death. The dead appear to the living, dragging them into another dimension known as the Beach, and the people who brave this terrifying world are forced to use Bridge Babies (or BBs) to sense them. These unborn babies are encased in an artificial womb - not dead, but not quite alive, existing in their own purgatory, too. Schrödinger’s tot.It’s also quite literally about the spaces in-between - the large swathes of landscape you travel across. Where most video games are built around what you do when you reach your destination - absentmindedly pushing forward on a stick or revving a vehicle to a destination - here the journey is the game, not the shooting people when you get there. It took 22 hours of playing Death Stranding before even I fired my first proper gun.




Watch on YouTube    
Since we got that very first trailer, people have been asking what Death Stranding actually is. Is it a stealth game? Sometimes. Is it an action game? Occasionally. For the most part, Death Stranding is a mountaineering game. Kojima has been talking up the online aspect - where structures created by other players appear in your world and vice versa (thank you, Captaindongs, for the bridge) - but it’s in the traversal where the game really does feel different. While there’s the odd boss fight and small pockets of combat scattered throughout, the majority of this huge 40-60 hour game is spent walking, planning, and creating infrastructure to make subsequent journeys easier.You take control of Sam Bridges (Norman Reedus) as he attempts to spread chiral network (spooky internet) coverage across America, travelling from the east coast to the west. You go to a terminal, accept a job, and stack up cargo on your back and limbs. You stack as much as you can carry without toppling over like a human Jenga tower, then you head out into the weirdly Icelandic USA. Between jobs, you kick it in a private room and take showers, pull faces in a mirror, and drink Monster Energy. Sometimes you see Norman Reedus’s full ass. Sometimes he winks at the camera. Sometimes you take a shit and an advert for Reedus’s AMC motorbike show pops up on the shower curtain. Why do you take a shit? Because the game turns your shit, piss, and sweat into different types of grenades. The poo one? EX Grenade Number Two, obviously.Hideo Kojima, a man in his 50s who once tweeted about his eggs looking like boobs, is known for having a puerile sense of humour, and that remains intact. One area that has improved here is in his portrayal of women. Yes, they might have daft names, but there is not a single whiff of tit. Progression! If it wasn’t for Troy Baker’s character, Higgs, occasionally licking peoples’ faces and, at one point, slapping Lindsey Wagner’s arse, it’d be a flawless victory.Let’s talk about those silly names for a moment. Heartman? He’s a guy who has a heart attack every 21 minutes. Die-Hardman? He hasn’t died once. Deadman is made of dead people, obviously. You idiot. Mama? She’s got a ghost baby. I was half expecting Mads Mikkelsen’s character, Cliff, to be made of rock. Death Stranding wields metaphor like a cudgel and beats you over the head with it. Sam Bridges, the man who’s travelling the world to connect people, has aphenphosmphobia - the fear of being touched. That’s just, like, so deep, man. Let me take another hit on this bong.For the most part, the story is overly complex nonsense. It’s a game of telling, not showing, where characters will stand and talk at you for full 30 minute stretches. In the opening three hours, you’re in control for a mere 30 minutes. At the end, there are back-to-back cutscenes that rival MGS 4’s ending. It goes back to attrition again, but this time it’s your attention span and not your stamina that’s being tested. The pre-release trailers and the discussion around them were ultimately far more interesting than what’s here, story-wise.When the cutscenes and endless exposition get out of the way, though, there’s an interesting, beautiful, unique, unfortunately repetitive game here. It’s a game I’m glad exists, even though I’m not entirely enamoured with it. Remember how MGS 5 had a secret cutscene that would only trigger if every single player in the entire world decided to get rid of their nukes in the online mode? It’s a continuation of that idea, with every action you make potentially impacting another player in their own journey. Before I give you an example, let me explain the basic mechanics.As mentioned, you stack yourself up with cargo. Depending on how you stack it, your weight shifts, though there’s an option to auto-optimise all cargo so you’ll just use that every time because why wouldn’t you? Sometimes you just need to get it from A to B. Sometimes you need to do it in a time limit. Sometimes there are further restrictions, such as carrying it by hand (manually keeping a trigger squeezed to keep hold), or keeping it flat. One side mission sees you literally delivering a pizza while it’s still hot and flat. You’re basically a Deliveroo employee at the end of the world.Once you’ve figured out how you want your cargo, you head off into the landscape. Like I said earlier, it’s Icelandic - the end credits show that they shot on location in Iceland - but it’s meant to be the US. It bears no resemblance at all to the US, except for how fractured it is and how it only takes 22 hours to get a gun. There are rivers to cross, mountains to pass, and basalt to trundle across. Different surfaces affect your balance in different ways, and it’s about finding the optimal route while maintaining your center of gravity. Take on too steep a slope and you’ll slip, damaging your cargo and traumatising Schrödinger’s tot in the process.You can actually plot your route by bringing up your map and drawing it out. Later, you can predict weather patterns such as wind and timefall - also known as rain, except this ages things and fucks up your cargo with prolonged exposure... a bit like a Hermes driver. You also have to decide whether you want to try to pass over obstacles - mountains, enemy camps, and more - or take an indirect, safer route. Often, this depends on the tools you have. If you have enough climbing anchors and extendable ladders, a mountain can be tamed. It’s that famous video game marketing line again: “You see that mountain over there? It’s a prick.”One huge river at the base of a waterfall was my personal nemesis. I had to clamber down a cliffside to reach it and it seemed impassable. I couldn’t build a bridge over it because I hadn’t extended the network that far yet, so I had to try to find another way around, ultimately scaling an almost sheer cliff to bypass it. Later, I came back to the river with zipline structures and built an easy way across, both for me and for any weary traveller who might come up against what I just suffered through.Once you make it to the end of a mission, you get rated for the route you took, the time it took you to complete, and the state of the cargo. You also accrue a currency called ‘likes’ through your endeavours, both from NPCs and other players who use your structures and vehicles. Similarly to social media ‘likes’, these don’t actually seem to serve any worth whatsoever, but they do make you feel warm and fuzzy inside. The rating system is similarly pointless, though occasionally it doles out some incremental upgrades to things such as balance and likes received. Unfortunately, there are a few occasions in the story where the rating system bumps up against the human drama - there’s nothing quite like getting an S Rank for incinerating a loved one.When you’re driving along a road you’ve built, or firing yourself through the air in a series of linked up sci-fi ziplines, Death Stranding nails its objective. You are rewarded for your patience, planning, and foresight. The issue is, the reward is the ability to skip the core gameplay as much as possible, to automate the walking through well-laid equipment. Later, you can even use robots to cover minor deliveries for you, too. It feels like it is building up to a big payoff towards the end, but it completely undermines itself once it gets there. Once you reach the west coast, you’re forced to head back east again. Only now, timefall storms have ruined all your equipment. Instead of this being an opportunity to marvel at your work and trace a route back through it, it’s just a 50 minute slog back to the other side of the map in a single mission.Death Stranding does have its moments, though. Because it’s mostly walking around a vast environment while listening to Hideo Kojima’s Spotify playlist, action sequences are extremely tense when they do happen. One of the main bands of enemies are Mules. These were Deliveroo drivers like you once, but they forgot the reason they were doing it and now they just steal shit and deliver it to themselves. They have beacons dotted around their camps that ping your cargo, then they head out in a van to mess you up.Combat is a simple, one button affair, though you can also launch luggage at peoples’ faces. Most of the time, it’s best to try to escape. In one such encounter, I ran through a wheat field like a Tory, dodging electrical spears as they rained in, escaping into a derelict barn up ahead. From there, I used a ladder to escape through the broken roof and dropped down behind them, stealing their vehicle and gunning it until its battery died. I’ve also crept into Mule camps and stolen cargo from under them, strangling dudes while concealed and using a harpoon gun to snatch goods away from distant tents. In the entire 44 hours I played, probably less than four of those hours were spent in action sequences like this.Elsewhere, you have to creep past the ghosts that appear in the rain, using your BB to sense them with a robotic arm attached to your suit. This is just a case of creeping slowly and changing direction as needed. Later, grenades and a melee stealth attack makes them almost pointless encounters - all the tension falls away. If you are grabbed, you enter a boss arena where you can throw grenades at an oil dog, oil whale, or oil squid while jumping over rooftops.At some specific story points, you’re whisked away to other places for exciting, one-off action sequences. These moments are huge standouts, but they come so late that I imagine a good portion of players would have fallen off by then. The same goes for some of the most interesting equipment - exoskeletons, a cargo carrier that you can ride like a snowboard, those ziplines, the harpoon gun, and more - which doesn’t come until you’re into the double digits.If you do manage to hold out, you will be rewarded with flashes of brilliance, it’s just that those flashes are buried as deep as the core story is buried in the endless dialogue. And as profound as it wants to be, this is still a game in which you can equip and unequip your penis so you can piss out Red Bull. The good stuff is waiting for you beyond that piss, beyond the shit grenades, beyond that Ride with Norman Reedus advert unceremoniously plastered into a game universe where I didn’t see a single television set. It’s just a test of attrition.Version tested: PS4 Pro. A review copy was kindly supplied by Sony. You're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!

Death Stranding,Mick Fraser,God is a Geek,https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/death-stranding-pc-review/,"July 14, 2020It’s difficult to say anything about Death Stranding that hasn’t already been said, given the discourse that surrounded Hideo Kojima’s delivery-themed vision of post-Apocalypse America. To call it divisive would be like calling a Category 5 hurricane “a light breeze”; it effectively sundered the gaming community, causing heated discussions not just between the followers of rival consoles but within the PlayStation community itself. One thing that was abundantly clear no matter which side of the fence an argument was shouted from was that this game was a unique creation from one of gaming’s greatest visionaries. Say what you like about Kojima, you’ll never say he’s predictable.Arriving on PC in the midst of a global pandemic that has forced families and friends apart, elements of Death Stranding feel oddly prescient – more so than they did when it was released on PS4 in late 2019. The theme of isolation and the hope of re-connection rings bells now that it couldn’t have back then, as the real world staggers drunkenly along the brink of societal collapse. And yet, there’s something almost perversely calming about Death Stranding. It doesn’t relentlessly rile up emotion – although it has its share of story beats, which seem to either hit the mark dead centre or spin clumsily into space, with little middle ground – but instead intersperses a high concept science fiction yarn with long periods of pensive quiet.You play Sam Porter Bridges, a porter for a company called Bridges (honestly, only Kojima would even try to get away with this stuff), which is essentially a delivery company that appears to be all that remains of the US government. His mother, the President (whose name is Bridget Strand, seriously), runs the company along with the masked Die-Hardman and Deadman, played by auteur director Guillermo del Toro. Sam’s job is to reconnect America using “strands”, bringing a disconnected nation back onto a data grid that will allow them to recreate an infrastructure that gets humanity back on the straight and narrow.Several decades ago, an apocalyptic event known as the Death Stranding caused the worlds of the living and the dead to converge, plaguing Earth with hostile, ghostly apparitions called BTs, or “Beached Things” for reasons that will be revealed in the story and which we won’t go into here for fear of spoilers. Whatever their purpose, BTs are terrifying entities, invisible save for the handprints they leave on everything they touch, revealed only to people like Sam who are afflicted with a condition called DOOMS that allows them to see or sense BTs. Sam is a gifted individual, but he’s not the only one, and characters like Fragile, the enigmatic CEO of a rival delivery company, and Higgs, the charismatic yet clearly unhinged villain, have their own special abilities granted by the Death Stranding. To go much deeper into story details would be to spoil some incredible surprises and some genuinely unique ideas, but suffice to say it gets weirder and weirder the more you play.Sam’s job is to deliver, and so that’s what you’ll be doing for almost the entire game. Calling Death Stranding a “hiking simulator” is disparagingly reductive, but not entirely untrue. There is but one mission type, and that’s to transport goods to or from destinations on the sprawling map. If you fall or get yourself into a fight, you can damage, destroy or simply lose some of your packages, resulting in reduced “likes” from the recipient and client. Likes act almost like a social currency, but are really just a repackaged version of XP. Some destinations can be brought back onto the grid, lengthening the strand and expanding the reach of the “Chiral Network”, an energy grid that allows you to build structures or map the terrain. Initially unarmed and on foot, each trek is an arduous undertaking occasionally punctuated by a handful of very real dangers.Firstly, human “bandits” known as MULEs will attack Sam for the cargo he carries. Their relentless kleptomania means they’ll track and, if necessary, kill to get their hands on packages, because, for some reason, they worship the very act of delivering goods. I mean, we’ve all been there while waiting on Amazon to show up. But while MULEs are a menace, they’re never very threatening. Sam is pretty handy with his fists and feet, and before long you’ll unlock weapons and gizmos to make your life even easier, and sooner or later the MULEs will be more of a nuisance than a threat.The second primary enemies are the BTs themselves. When it rains (which isn’t water, but “Chiral matter” that ages whatever it touches), there’s always a chance that BTs will appear. To begin with, all you can do is sneak past them, pinging the area for a glimpse of their position and holding your breath if they get too close. The first few times it’s nerve-wracking, especially given how these creatures are initially introduced. But before long you’ll create weapons made with Sam’s unique bodily fluids, such as bombs loaded with his blood or phials of his pee. Once you have a few weapons in your arsenal, getting past BTs becomes almost too easy.Similarly, the travel is difficult at first, but you’re slowly given vehicles and tools that make your journeys less dangerous. There’s even a fast-travel system, although it’s annoyingly limited to the main settlements and not the myriad dropping off points along the way. Of course, this is because Kojima-san wants you to experience as much of this world as possible, and it’s not hard to see why. The level of detail is impressive, as you’d expect from Kojima’s team, and there are moments you’ll experience when crossing country that take the game to another level; cresting the last hill above your destination after a gruelling trek that’s left you covered in mud and Chiral matter, and hearing one of the exceptional music tracks kick in is something you have to feel for yourself. It won’t convert you if you’re not enjoying the game, but if you’re already fully invested I guarantee it will stir something inside you.The PC version is, frankly, visually staggering. Death Stranding looked great on PS4, but running this at its highest settings with no upper limit on the frame rate (it tops at 240 though some won’t have the hardware to run that consistently) is incredible to look at. My PC is more than decent, running a GeForce 2060 RTX Super with the settings all the way up and it’s just gorgeous. There are still a few issues with the actual physics, of course, as you try to steady Sam with piles of cargo on his back across rocky terrain, over rivers and up sheer hillsides, and he will occasionally clip into the landscape – but on sheer optics alone it’s stunning. The cutscenes are beautifully rendered, with little details sewn in to bring the characters to life in impressive ways.You can choose to play on mouse and keyboard if you like and for many this will be the automatic choice, but it was built for a controller and it works very well. I will say that given the amount of time you’ll spend in menus, loading Sam up pre-trek or fabricating gear and weapons, maybe erecting structures out in the world, the mouse is a god-send. I regularly switched to using the mouse in the menus as it just felt more intuitive for the inventory management. There’s also some new content in the PC version in the form a crossover with Half Life and Portal. It’s not game-changing stuff, but it’s a nice addition for the fans and one I’ll let you discover for yourself.Much noise has been made about the multiplayer integration, and with good reason. It’s a shared-world system similar to something like Dark Souls, whereby other players can influence your world but you’ll never play alongside them – or even see them, except as spectres in the late game that can help with boss fights. As you play you’ll use tools like ladders and climbing ropes, build bridges, charging towers and watchtowers, erect post boxes to leave deliveries for other players to collect and fulfil – and roads, miles of roads that connect settlements and make travelling by vehicle that much easier and safer. As you bring the Chiral Network online, structures built by other players will appear in your game, not only helping you out but revealing the broken details of thousands of other stories, a tapestry of painstaking progress to help you find your way.Death Stranding is an easy game to form an opinion of, but it’s a difficult game to wholeheartedly recommend. It is so deliberately divisive that almost everyone I’ve spoken to has a different opinion and fully justifiable reasons to back it up. Some people – myself included – fall in love with the world, with the otherworldly mystery and jaded majesty of it all. Others will be all-in on the bonkers story, drawn in deeply by the superb performances given by Norman Reedus, Mads Mikkelsen, Lea Seydoux and Troy Baker. Others still will enjoy the oddly lulling rhythm of the core gameplay loop.But for all those who love Death Stranding there will be an equal number of those who hate every minute, or find it all a pretentious grind for little reward. And every one of these opinions, good or bad, is valid, because Death Stranding really is all of those things. It’s dull and vibrant, clever and convoluted, thrilling and idling, beautiful and grim. It swings between supremely satisfying and maddeningly frustrating, and though it’s trite to say it, it isn’t a game made for everyone. That said, I was in all he way within the first few hours and it’s grip on me never let up. It’s not without its issues and some of the design and direction choices will raise questions, but it’s a fantastic odyssey through a unique, engaging world.Looks incredible

Death Stranding,Kyle Hanson,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/death-stranding-review/,"Few games launch with as much anticipation and confusion surrounding them as Death Stranding. The title comes from one of gaming’s most celebrated creators, Hideo Kojima. But it also represents a big change for him, coming from his brand new studio and shifting away from the iconic Metal Gear Solid series. Would this mean a better game, or would it delve too deeply into the elements that started to turn some players away from his previous work. In the end, it’s a bit of both, but what we certainly have with Death Stranding is a bold, almost experimental release with all the polish and attention to detail of a AAA, Kojima directed game. Beneath that veneer though is a story that struggles to come together as well as it could or should. Feeling like an unfinished puzzle at times, though the pieces that do fit together are quite beautiful on their own.Describing the plot of Death Stranding often diminishes it in some ways, as many players will find the further they get into the main story. If you’ve watched all the released trailers and footage, no doubt you have pieced together the basics in your own head. A massive, world changing event has occurred resulting in a sort of merging of the worlds of the living and the dead. Every death now carries with it a threat to anyone nearby, with humans essentially becoming a nuclear bomb hours after they pass. A side effect of this is Timefall, where rain falls from the sky, rapidly aging anything it touches. And with Timefall come BTs, spectral entities who linger on Earth, trying to kill anything they can touch, leading to even more chaos, fear, and confusion.To combat this, human society has fractured, splitting apart into fortified cities or smaller settlements out in the wilds. Surrounding themselves with walls and borders, humans are no longer connected to each other as they were before, which is exactly  what you’ll be trying to change. As Sam Porter you will deliver packages, but more importantly you’ll be rebuilding America by connecting people back up through the Chiral Network. This connection not only solidifies personal bonds, but also expands Sam and the player’s reach, growing your stable of safe havens and helpful contributors amidst the chaos and danger of the post-Death Stranding world. But does this Chiral Network hold the key to mankind’s salvation, or will it simply hasten its doom?These are just the basics of Death Stranding’s long and sometimes meandering story. Stretching over a campaign that will easily take around 40 hours to complete even without side content, the plot spirals into multiple directions from there. This often delivers truly touching and emotionally charged story content, such as the deeper dives into Sam’s helpful side characters, especially Mama, Fragile, and the Mysterious Man. All are played by some of Hollywood’s biggest actors with the best character designs in practically any video game. Other times, however, it strays closer to the more extreme and slightly unintelligible elements of Kojima’s later Metal Gear games.Death Stranding enmeshes its story with its gameplay more than most other gamesThat’s not to say the story doesn’t make sense, it does. It is just structured in ways that leave the player wondering what exactly is going on at most times. Character’s names and their relationships are muddied in an intentional fashion. And while this works for the first few chapters, eventually you start to wonder how much more impactful the plot would be if you had a firmer grasp on what was going on in the deeper aspects of the narrative. You are often fed this information eventually, but it arrives after moments that would have landed harder and with more emotional heft had you known the details earlier. Foreshadowing and cryptic plots work well, but Death Stranding takes it to an extreme that harms the overall goal, which is to make you feel its many messages at your core.To its great credit, Death Stranding enmeshes its story with its gameplay more than most other games, which often helps to overcome this fault. The story is about the struggle to connect humans to each other, conquering their fears and fighting against the forces that seek to divide us. Similarly the gameplay will task players with many things that they’ll find difficult or frustrating. At its core, this is an adventure game, with Sam questing across the entire country, now dubbed the United Cities of America. On that journey you’re most common task will simply be to get whatever cargo you’re carrying from point A to point B. A fetch quest if you will, but somehow Death Stranding pulls off the miracle of making these seemingly simple and mundane tasks feel weighty and enjoyable.Each mission typically boils down to picking up cargo at one of the “Knot Cities”, distribution centers, or shelters then trekking across vast stretches of land to deliver it. To accomplish this you have many tools at your disposal, such as ladders, ropes, vehicles, or buildable structures. Along the way you’ll almost always find BT infested areas, rogue humans seeking to steal your precious cargo, or some lost items/supplies you can drop off along the way. Those first two are where Death Stranding shifts to a more typical game experience; featuring tense moments of stealth or even full blown combat, though this is rarely the focus. What the gameplay does put a heavy emphasis on is inventory and weight management, along with maintaining Sam and his BB’s health and well being, with various systems in place to handle it all.Combat, even in the cinematic and spectacular boss battles, typically boils down to standard run and gun action with rare encounters feeling like a true challenge. Stealth works a fair bit better, utilizing the BB, a baby that connects Sam to the “other side”, to point out danger for you to avoid. During these moments you’ll expend health and stamina, as well as cause stress for BB. Managing all of this is simple and easy, but takes a lot of time often unnecessarily. For example, resting at a Safe Haven, something you do quite often, forces players to watch or skip through multiple cutscenes that will become repetitive very quickly. Everything from inventory management to health systems are well designed given how much there is to keep in check, though the many screens and mechanics can be overwhelming through the first few chapters.On paper, Death Stranding’s gameplay sounds extremely dull and frustrating, and indeed it can start to feel that way at times. However, this is actually the goal more often than not, with the game using its gameplay mechanics to drive home its message of connection and how important it is to work together for the greater good. The element that hammers this home the most is the online mechanic, which isn’t full multiplayer, but still impacts the game in huge ways. Throughout your time journeying around the world of Death Stranding you can build structures to make these trips easier. Is there a river in your way? Build a bridge. Keep running out of battery halfway to one location? Build a generator. And in building those things you not only help yourself but your fellow players as well. This is where Death Stranding truly hits its stride.As you connect more areas of the world to the Chiral Network, behind the scenes you’re also connecting it to our own internet. Each time a new area goes live it will be flooded with objects, messages, supplies, and lost packages from other players. What this means in terms of the gameplay is that everything just got a lot easier. Areas that used to be nearly impassable become simple thanks to another player’s bridge, ladder, or shelter. Signs start to show up that hint at potential dangers or areas full of resources. Through connecting the fictional characters you’ve also connected yourself to your fellow real-life human beings.This may seem simple, and indeed it’s an option some players may just turn off without even thinking about it. And yet, it is Death Stranding’s biggest achievement. The game is telling players through both its literal plot and the gameplay that connecting with others is important, that it makes your life and the lives of those around you richer and more enjoyable. And this works so well that many players will find themselves simply working toward the goal of earning more “Likes” which players can reward to each other for providing some piece of equipment or assistance. Did you find that mountain particularly tough to traverse? Build a zip-line network across it and not only will you benefit, but every other player you connect with through Death Stranding’s online element will as well.The game looks and feels great even as it frustrates youBut while the ethereal elements work to push the underlying narrative, the story itself doesn’t fully come together in the end. As I described it, it felt like a puzzle was being put together in front of me. Sometimes large chunks would fit together perfectly and hint at the greater whole, but that whole never developed in a satisfying way, even after the game dumps its major plot details on you through longer cutscenes and exposition. It relies so much on technobabble that doesn’t touch onto the larger themes that it results in more frustration at how a similar story could have been conveyed than it does genuine surprise and emotion. There are great moments within, but the whole is less than the sum of its parts, unfortunately.Given how much the gameplay presents players with typically frustrating mechanics in service of this plot, you would think its partial failure would create an overall negative feeling about the game as a whole. However, thanks to the exceptional work on the underlying systems and presentation elements, the game looks and feels great even as it frustrates you. The simple act of climbing a mountain may take a lot of time as you struggle to maintain your balance, fend off BTs, and work to secure supplies, but once you clear it it leads to a true joy like few other games can deliver. And everything simply looks and sounds glorious with some of the best graphics out there, and a soundtrack that many will download and keep on a perpetual loop.Even without the story or any set mission, the world itself is worthy of exploration. Every new area looks simply amazing, and features hidden secrets that are worth discovering. The old adage of “do you see that mountain? You can climb that mountain” is 100% true for Death Stranding, and the game benefits greatly from it. It has that wonderful quality of simply getting lost in the world, wasting time exploring some new area or stumbling across a side quest that you otherwise would have missed. Players could dedicate dozens of hours to this without being upset or feeling like they missed out on much, though that’s only if the core mechanics gel with your particular taste.And of course, being a Kojima game, there are so many moments of pure fun and meta humor that the game never truly feels like it takes itself too seriously. Sure, there’s an important message at its core, but you can also just go around peeing on everything and ignoring the plot entirely, if you want. That is likely what will happen to a majority of players, with huge sections of the game devoted to building up and improving sections of the map. If you stop here, the story will be incomplete, but the game will continue to surprise and delight you with its amazingly complex mechanics and intense attention to detail. And with the online elements, players will always have new things to work on or interact with.Death Stranding is equal parts amazing and exasperating. It features stellar acting, graphics, and sound. It’s a revelation in many of its gameplay mechanics, while also relying on typically frustrating things like fetch quests and inventory management. And it’s a game that is laser focused on conveying a message both in its story and gameplay. But the story lacks the punch it could have had, if it had been structured in a way that leaned into those moments, rather than obfuscating them. What it does without exception though is meld the gameplay with the message, creating something truly unique in the end. If you can work through its frustrating parts and look past its plot failings, there’s something wonderful here, but many will come away disappointed if their expectations aren’t in check.
- This article was updated on November 1st, 2019 Attack of the Fanboy / GAME REVIEWS / Death Stranding Review"
Death Stranding,Chris White,God is a Geek,https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/death-stranding-review/,"November 8, 2019Even now, after finishing Death Stranding, I can’t quite believe it’s all over. The bizarre trailers that made no sense at the time; the social media posts; gameplay videos that slowly showed exactly what the game would feature, and every spoonful of information all finally accumulated into something real: Death Stranding is a remarkable game. There’s so much to say about it, and it’s not perfect, but one thing I cannot stress enough is that Hideo Kojima is one of a kind. Nobody can craft such a unique story and tell it in the same way that he can, with an ability to offer truly magnificent moments that blow you away, and give you an ending that will leave you thinking about it long after it’s over.But what actually is Death Stranding? I expected a lot of variety in mission types, but it all kind of boils down to one simple thing: deliver the package, and connect the world. I never really thought about this until the game was over, but fundamentally, you’re taking cargo and delivering it to people across a world in need – ruined by the Death Stranding event – trying to rebuild a country that once stood as one of the world’s biggest powers. It’s not quite as simple as that, but that’s the gist. It is how you do this and how you choose to approach each mission that makes up the meat of your journey. Some people you encounter, like the Elder, won’t agree to join the United Cities of America (UCA), but he may provide equipment to help you. When you do connect with another Prepper, distribution centre, or city that does want to connect with the UCA, you’ll unlock everything in that region built by other real world players.You’ll find lots of different structures that others have built available for you to use, and these are absolutely vital in your survival. Generators will help recharge your Skeleton Suit, truck, or motorbike. Timefall Shelters will keep you out of the degenerative rain and wait until it goes away, and Safehouses allow you to fully recover. Additionally, players may have built a bridge that allows you to cross over impassable areas, or spawned a Postbox where you can store and collect lots of useful items. Ladders and climbing anchors may also be scattered around connected areas, as well as vehicles and signs providing useful information. You can also build these structures providing you have the right materials on you, and you’ll receive likes for your contributions which help to level you up.You don’t get skill trees or ability points, or anything like that, but the better your ranking the better you become as a Porter. Other players can give you more likes, better jobs become available, and you’ll be much more acclimatised to the tougher biomes you’ll find yourself passing through. Likes are a cool way of connecting with other players, too. Acknowledging others hard work (because building is hard work) makes you feel happy to contribute. You have to carry metals, resin, special alloys, and other materials with you to be able to build, so these structures can’t simply be built from entering a menu and pressing a button. Players can also contribute to the world simply by travelling through the same routes in their own game. If enough players walk the same route, the terrain will form a kind of dirt path that makes it safer to travel through when you’re next there. Also, you can build highways that become vital for smooth and safe travels, but these take up a lot of resources and time, so it all depends on how much time you want to give to resurfacing the UCA with shiny new roads.The terrain in which you travel across can be brutal. Rivers that can sweep you off your feet, treacherous mountain ranges where boulders can knock you on your ass, snowy peaks featuring horrific snow storms, rock formations that can only be approached on foot, and deep crevices that can’t be crossed without the right equipment. Sometimes you’re travelling for long periods of time, and factoring in the best route to take before setting out is vital to both a safe journey and undamaged cargo. With every delivery you make you get ranked, and your score depends on a number of factors, such as the speed at which you make the drop and the amount of damage the cargo has taken. I won’t lie, these journeys can be hellish. Forget the toughest boss in Dark Souls – these are the epitome of cruelty – and my biggest frustration with Death Stranding. Not every one is an utter pain, but some will leave you reeling.If you fall when carrying cargo, it can become damaged. Certain packages can’t be submerged under water. Others are fragile, so must be carried by hand. As you progress through Death Stranding, it will become easier, though. You’ll unlock the floating carrier which can be loaded up with cargo, power skeletons that improve the amount you can carry, and trucks you can load plenty of stuff onto, but you won’t be able to drive across certain areas due to the uneven terrain, so constant micromanagement is key to making sure you get to where you want to go safely. This becomes quite a chore, especially when you make a call to do it on foot (because you may only be travelling a short distance), only to find you’re having to use L2 and R2 to repeatedly balance your weight.A lot of the time you’ll start to lean to one side because the weight’s momentum is causing you to do so. If you run down a hill too fast or trip over a rock, you have to make sure you don’t lose your balance, so using the triggers is something you have to do constantly. It’s not so much a pain when readjusting over relatively flat surfaces, but making your way across uneven mountain faces or rocky terrain with the potential to trip at any moment becomes incredibly frustrating. Tripping over will cause you to drop your cargo and, in turn, damage it, so I’d have much preferred balance just being an automatic thing instead of you having to manage that on top of everything else.One of your greatest tools is your Odradek (a Franz Kafka character comprised of tangled threads, FYI), and it helps you to scan terrain and see how dangerous certain areas can be. It gives you blue, yellow, and red warnings that allow you to cross over safer avenues, with blue being the safest and red being an absolute no go. Using the Odradek to cross rivers is so important because if you even attempt to move through red areas you’ll be swept away as will your cargo, and losing it this way means it’ll be swept much further away leaving you with little chance of getting it back.The Odradek is connected to your Bridge Baby (BB), and it also becomes a tool to detect BTs (Death Stranding’s supernatural enemies) when out in the field. Timefall is a weather cycle that manifests in the form of heavy rain or snow, and if you start to see a downpour, it means that BTs aren’t far away. Timefall can also damage your cargo, so there’s yet another way for your deliveries to suffer a lower ranking. Whenever you see your Odradek go crazy under the Timefall, it instills a sense of dread, and for the first ten hours or so, it’s genuinely terrifying. Floating ghost-like creatures hang in the air, and you must pass by them without alerting their presence. Remaining silent means they won’t be alerted, but you’ll need to crouch and hold your breath for this or else they’ll come for you.Sam’s blood has special properties for fighting the BTs, and you’ll eventually be able to use anti-BT weaponry to dispose of them. If they do find you, a tar-like substance appears, and moaning creatures emerge from it and grab you, attempting to pull you in. You can shake them off, but you may drop all your equipment, and if you aren’t successful they’ll drag you off into a hellish battle against a tar-soaked monster that’ll do all it can to kill you. Buildings will sink, as will anything within the vicinity, and deciding whether or not to fight them or not all depends on whether you’ve got a healthy arsenal. These moments are beautifully staged, but can be avoided as long as you play it safe.Impatience plays a big role in whether or not you’ll evade the BTs, and Kojima and his team knows this. When all you want to do is get to the next destination without interruption, you’ll more often than not try and escape an impending BT attack. However, clumsiness and ignorance will just cause your downfall. They’re an amazing enemy, but when you’re making long journeys and BTs show up at the end… death at the hands of them is so, so frustrating. Thankfully, by pressing the touch-pad whilst in these fights, you’ll call other players to throw equipment to you such as grenades and guns, so you can get a bit of extra help when fighting these behemoths.Your other enemy comes in the form of Mules, and they’re marauders that prey on the other Porters of the world. There are zones they reconvene in, and if you pass through their area they’ll try and steal your stuff. They’re represented by orange outlines on the map, and if they find you, be prepared to either run or fight. You’ll gain the ability to fry their signal so they can’t locate you, but if you find that they’re onto you, making an escape can be tricky. I love the mules: they’re humans who were once Porters like you, but in time went a bit mad, and earlier on they’ll use stun tactics to stop you. Eventually they’ll use deadly force in the form of assault rifles and grenades, and you can choose to evade them (which is often the best strategy), or take them all out. The Bola Gun is a unique weapon that fires an electrified cable at them to temporarily paralyse, and you can also use stun grenades.Their camps are full of other cargo and equipment collected from other players, and you can choose to loot them or leave them. If you end up killing Mules, the BTs can take over their souls and become an even greater threat to you, so the decision to use deadly force also factors into whether or not you want more BTs on your tail. Sam is not a soldier, so you never truly need to pull the trigger. It gives Death Stranding an interesting dynamic and means that if you wanted to take your time and play stealthily, you could. It means that you’ll be able to get from A-to-B without losing any cargo or life, but it just depends on how patient you are.Cargo management also plays a significant role when deciding on how much blood you carry with you on any given mission. Health is regained by connecting a new blood bag to you, but not only is it a source of health, it also laces your ammo with blood, which is hugely affected against BTs. You can find blood bags in the field, but making sure you’ve got enough at the start of a mission is a key element to each journey. Your map is incredibly useful, even if it does become a tangled web of route plans and icons. Weather patterns become available showing you where Timefall is present, and how long it may stay in one area. You can also plan your route by connecting waypoints to your destination, and by using the touchpad you can rotate the map to show mountainous zones and tricky areas to get around.Outside of the map and in the game, by holding L1 you can use view destination points, as well as checking on BB to see if they’re OK. Certain exposure to BTs, or falling over too many times can upset them and cause them to go into shock, and once this happens they’ll not be able to detect BTs. Taking time to rock your controller from side to side in order to relax them, or playing in a Hot Spring with them makes them happy again, as does travelling to your Private Room. I became emotionally invested in BB throughout, and often found myself doing whatever it took to make sure they were OK. Hearing them laugh or cry through the controller never became annoying, it only highlighted my need to keep them safe. Death Stranding is all about making connections – whether through other players, your BB, or uniting the UCA, and it’s also a social commentary that shows just how important our connections with one another are.You’ll spend a lot of time in your Private Room, and these moments of reflection and relaxation are important to Sam in a number of ways. Once you enter a Private Room all your vitals are restored, such as your health and stamina. Your equipment and vehicle’s batteries are also replenished, and an amount of your blood is extracted, too. Sam can also take a shower, relieve himself with a number one and two, and by doing this gives you grenades to use in battle. Heartman is the UCA’s smarty pants, and he lets you know early on that the components found in your bodily fluid can be used to make some pretty sweet weapons – who knew?BB will also be returned to full working order, and you can have a few beers and eat some bugs if you’re feeling peckish. You can read emails from all of the characters you connect with, check orders you’ve undertaken, and listen to music you’ve unlocked. Eventually fast travel is unlocked, but by doing this you won’t be able to take any cargo with you. Time in the Private Room isn’t always necessary, but using these moments to play around take away the frustrations of making consistently long journeys. Also, they give you time to regroup and read the copious amounts of interviews you’ll be able to read, all giving you plenty of information about the Death Stranding.Hideo Kojima is renowned for writing some of the most out-there stories ever seen in video games, and whilst Death Stranding is certainly ambitious when it comes to the game’s plot, it makes a lot of sense, and constantly introduces some fantastic set pieces. It is both bombastic and sentimental, reflecting on a world lost after a cataclysmic event, and how those left in its wake try to rebuild a fallen America through friendship and connection. When it comes to the action and science fiction elements, Kojima gets it 100% right. The cutscenes are a thing of beauty, from the flashback sequences to the all-out blockbuster moments. Mads Mikkelsen is by far the game’s stand out star, both in character and acting, and his reasoning for doing the things he does are both relatable and terrifying.There’re many twists and turns in Sam’s story, and every single character provides great exposition for what Kojima’s message is, even when it feels certain conversational scenes are long-winded. Norman Reedus plays the working man hero so well, from his incredulity in the UCA to his understanding of the importance of friendship and connection the further you get. His relationship with BB also builds at a great pace, and the emotional bonds you make as the story progress is subtle, but can also leave you speechless. Death Stranding had me in tears a few times, but as the credits rolled I was an utter mess. The story left a huge impression on me, and I’m still thinking about it even now.The supporting characters are all excellent, too. Troy Baker’s Higgs is a huge presence; both terrifying and hauntingly understated. Fragile is played wonderfully by Léa Seydoux, becoming a close friend to Sam, and you end up empathizing with her as you learn more about her story. Guillermo del Toro’s Deadman is also a stand out character who has his own mental journey throughout the game that you’re equally invested in. Perhaps the best of all, though, is Mama. The way in which her story opens up is quite honestly breathtaking and equally heart-wrenching. Margaret Qualley does a fantastic job of making you fall in love with her, and I found myself drawn to her charm and sweetness from the beginning.Death Stranding has a lot of other characters whose stories take place over the course of main and side missions, and even in these Kojima has put a lot of effort into telling. In one mission, you reunite a couple who have been lost since the voidouts. The genius, though, is that when you finally manage to do so, their story continues through various emails in its wake, and it’s amazing that this amount of effort even exists. But that’s what Death Stranding is. There has been so much time and effort put into every facet of it that you can’t quite believe the level of detail on offer. From the cargo management to structure building, the story to the strand elements, Death Stranding is a behemoth of a game.It’s also easily one of the best looking games on the PlayStation 4. Character animation is stunning in the cutscenes, and the landscapes are phenomenal. Natural occurrences like the Timefall and rockslides are breathtaking, and Kojima’s direction becomes a dream to watch. The soundtrack is perfect, from Low Roar’s folk-infused chillout tracks to Ghost Poet’s haunting musical epics, I can’t praise it enough.Death Stranding is an ambitious game, featuring so many different systems and ideas, but it never falls under the weight of them. Whilst journeying across a crumbled America can be hugely frustrating at times, I never got bored of it, and through the powerful story, tense gameplay, and amazing action sequences, this will go down one of Kojima’s best. Taking time to build the necessary structures and adapt to the terrain is time consuming, but making sure you’re prepared will make your experience a much better one. Fabricating tons of cool equipment is exciting, especially when you earn the ability to build something new, and the message of connecting people provides an important backdrop for a wonderful game.Incredible story and superb acting

Death Stranding,Joshua Wise,VideoGamer,http://www.videogamer.com//reviews/death-stranding-review," Posted in Reviews
The hero of Death Stranding is played by Norman Reedus, whose signature low-lidded scowl has never seemed more appropriate. I mean, just take a look around: the skies are white and watery, and the ground below is bereft. A distant cataclysm, from which the game takes its name, has blighted the world and fallen from memory. Aside from the fact that the dead are having trouble being dead, and the living are having trouble with living, none of the characters seem to know quite what this Death Stranding is or how it works. Imagine that.Reedus plays Sam Porter Bridges, a courier by trade and a brooder by way of long-buried trauma. The coup of his performance, in providing both motion capture and voice, is just how little he provides. For much of the time he stays stone-faced, adding the occasional grimace; things don’t go unsaid so much as they go grumbled and sighed, as though the life were leaking out of him. Due to the frightening future through which Sam wades, his profession is nothing short of heroic. Humanity is splintered and spread thin, hiding out in crumbling cities and settlements, and the badlands between are prowled by unseen horrors. His daily orders, delivering as dull a payload as seeds or thermal underwear, carry an Odyssean weight.So what, we might ask, is going on? Details are divulged slowly, trickling through as if from a long thaw. Sam’s mother, Bridget, happens to be the president of the United States – though they’re far from united now – and she happens to be Lindsey Wagner, star of the Bionic Woman, who first appeared in The Six Million Dollar Man. She tasks Sam with reconnecting the country, via what’s called the Chiral Network, which sounds like she’s trying to sell him on a new broadband package, complete with a slogan: ‘You can make America whole,’ she says. (For my money, she should have gone with, ‘We can rebuild it; we have the technology!’) Call me crazy, but I think the director, Hideo Kojima, who co-wrote the script, might be making some sort of point here; as one character delicately points out, ‘If that’s not symbolic, I don’t know what is.’Moving across America, plugging each place into the network, most of your time is taken up by traversal: the shoulder triggers correspond to Sam’s hands, which grip the straps of his backpack in order to secure its weight – both hands when marching through waist-high water, to stop your goods from washing away, or just one hand to shift the weight away from the edge of a cliff, preventing Sam from slewing over the side. Your boots wear down over time, so it’s wise to keep a spare pair handy. You plot your course on Sam’s cuff link (a communicator resembling a pair of handcuffs), tilting the controller to reveal the topography. And be sure to rest periodically, allowing Sam to stretch and rub his shoulders. Quite remarkably, none of this is boring; in fact, it’s often thrilling. Each order you make is graded, with the golden splash of an S-rank awarded for speedy and damage-free deliveries.It is, in a newer and truer sense, a walking simulator. But there are other parts that make it harder to pin down. This will frustrate those who prefer quick categories – namely the PlayStation Store, which describes it noncommittally as an ‘action’ game. If you stand far enough back, anything can be shuffled into the broadest of genre boundaries. But where is the fun in standing far enough back? Death Stranding beckons you in close, breaking off chunks of horror, stealth, survival, action, adventure, and open-world exploration. While on your route, you sometimes run into Mules: crazed mercenaries addicted to hoarding stolen shipments, who pursue you with pings – radar-like ripples that tag your position – while brandishing javelins that crackle with bolts of electricity. These segments plunge you into stealth of a more stripped-back kind than Kojima fans are used to – reliant on tall grass and easy takedowns. It’s swift and satisfying, dovetailed discreetly into a larger game.Kojima Productions is a studio whose bones were made in the Metal Gear Solid series, and it’s no surprise that you can see them jutting up here and there like a half-buried skeleton. Note the Codec, which characters use to talk to Sam while he’s out in the wilderness. Meanwhile, there’s more than a touch of Mother Base in the way that Sam’s resources are managed; courtesy of the Chiral Network and its 3D printers, you can ply resources into R&D, cooking up equipment like the hover dolly, to glide your haul over uneven ground, and mech attachments for Sam’s legs, which power up his speed and all-terrain utility. There are vehicles, such as the long-range trike; robots, to make automated dispatches; and, for the civic-minded, there is even the option to build roads, laying the wastes with fresh, flat-surfaced progress. It’s easy to fritter away hours in fascination with infrastructure.Should such fascinated hours lull you into a lonely solitary, fear not; you have the social strand system to pull you back into the fold of your fellow players. You will see messages, dropped items, and climbing gear, like ladders and pitons, dug into the soil for you to use. I am relieved to say that this system – similar, in its stark spirit, to Dark Souls – is unobtrusive, thematically relevant, and, at times, touching. On more than one occasion, I huddled under another player’s shelter – the rain in Death Stranding, referred to as Timefall, ‘fast-forwards whatever it touches,’ causing accelerated aging (thus the hooded hazmat suits) and rusty cargo containers. (It’s like Rutger Hauer’s closing monologue, in Blade Runner, but replace ‘tears’ with ‘years’.) You can reward other players with likes, which affect their order ratings.I am also pleased to report, five years on from the release of P.T., that Kojima and his team have strayed into the inky verges of eco-horror. The monsters, called BTs (Beached Things), are invisible. They lurk and gurgle, their presence betrayed by oily handprints, and they just might be the vengeful spirits of the dead, stranded in transit. Fortunately, Sam has a Bridge Baby (BB) – an infant, encased in glass and clasped to the front of his suit, with a link to ‘the other side’. This is hooked up to the Odradek – a miniature metal windmill, fastened to his shoulder, which lights up and flaps in the direction of encroaching BTs. These encounters are clammy with tension; you hold R1 to stifle Sam’s breath, lest the creatures smell the fumes of life, and slowly creep to safety. If your BB is stressed, you can sooth it by gently swaying the controller. All these elements merge to form something fresh, and difficult to market.The game arrives, buoyed on the hot air of hype, trailing an assault of unwise publicity. (The problem persists in the cinema as well; by the time we’ve had the Teaser Trailer, Trailer 1, Trailer 2, the Superbowl Trailer, not forgetting the Red Band Trailer, and, of course, the Final Trailer – a title that always smacks of apology and promise – we’ve seen most films before they’re actually out.) Death Stranding suffers the great misfortune of being interesting and inscrutable to look at: to all appearances set in the Lake District, furnished with fetuses in jars, skull-faced villains, famous film directors, and the sort of buggies that belong on the lunar surface. It’s the kind of elevator pitch only possible in the Burj Khalifa.It’s also the result of four years of fresh air. Since his ugly departure from Konami, in 2015, which saw him setting up the independent studio behind this, we’ve seen him tweeting pictures of meals, people, and places, always with a beaming grin. You would think Konami was not an office in which games were made but a Dickensian workhouse, deprived of food, freedom, and human companionship. Spend an hour with Death Stranding and one thing becomes clear: Kojima swapped the cramped confines of his former employer for the cloistral darkness of the cinema. Every frame is filled with the films of recent years.The biggest influence, from which Kojima derives the game’s visual style, is Denis Villeneuve. Think of the scene, in Arrival, where we are first shown the alien craft, and you see the landscape of Death Stranding: dark crags covered in green blankets of moss, and waves of mist drifting over distant hills. In the city ruins, there are bits of Blade Runner 2049 – blocks of stone as grey as storm clouds, looming through windows of broken glass. There is also a hint of The Martian, Ridley Scott’s film of 2015, in the sight of Sam, in his rubber suit, dwarfed by a sweeping vista of rock. It’s all brought beautifully to life in the Decima Engine and infused with Kojima’s outlandish visual poetry: tar-black beaches strewn with dead whales, and men bearing unborn babies in glowing chambers on their chests.If only the writing could match the pictures. I shan’t delve into the particulars of the plot; suffice to say that, when scientists babble on about the human soul, I switch off. One character is called Die-Hardman (rumours persist that cut characters include Kill-Billman and a duo called Withnail and Isaac). The dialogue flits between the foolish (‘If we Americans don’t come together again, humanity won’t survive’) and the ludicrous (‘I brought you a metaphor’), and Kojima has two strategies to camouflage the shortfall. One is to lighten the load with humour, sending gags clattering across the fourth wall – hence the mission that sees Sam delivering a pizza, with a straight face, to a far-off research outpost. The other is to hire a cast of very talented actors, whose performances pull your attention away from the blind spots.Mads Mikkelsen is an enigmatic villain, called Clifford Unger, though his villainy is submerged in sadness. While Troy Baker, as Higgs, possesses the sort of writhing wickedness that belongs in the reptile house. Margaret Qualley plays an ally, called Mama, acting on a higher wattage and outshining anyone she shares scenes with. And Léa Seydoux, who has that sort of scratchy, faint voice that brings you in close, for fear of missing a word, plays another courier, called Fragile. But I can’t help but wish that Kojima was given slightly less free a hand in some of the decisions; having Guillermo del Toro and Nicolas Winding Refn lend their likenesses to a pair of scientists feels more like a stunt than good casting. What’s more, it pricks the airtight tone of the world (as does the horrific product placement, which sees Monster Energy proudly surviving the end of days).Most of the time, however, our focus falls where Kojima conducts it. He is a precisian, honing his love of small, simple actions. It’s there when we see the cigarette smoke trickling from Mikkelsen’s mouth, or Mama cradling a baby that isn’t there. These seem inconsequential until, days later, you realise they haven’t left your mind. Kojima once described the video games of the 1980s, when his career began, saying, ‘It was like the era of the silent films. Games were composed of simple actions like those seen in old Chaplin or Keaton movies: running, jumping, digging, throwing.’ In many ways, they still are. Death Stranding certainly is, and it’s filled with things that must be seen. My guess is that all its clunky moments will be lost in time, like cargo in rain.Developer: Kojima ProductionsPublisher: SonyAvailable on: PlayStation 4Release Date: November 8, 2019To check what a review score means from us, click here.

You spend hours sorting through cargo, stacking it on trucks and in a backpack, and lugging it across the continent. And if it gets too heavy or unbalanced you’re going to stumble and need to press some buttons to catch your balance before you fall and damage your load.”Sign up to receive the daily top stories from the Financial Post, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.A welcome email is on its way.

Please try again Silence in the room.“But you’re not just any delivery man. You’re a delivery man played by Norman Reedus after the apocalypse. See, invisible floating dead people from another dimension have found their way into our world, attached to the physical plane via ethereal umbilical cords. Don’t worry; you’ll learn more about all this stuff from Guillermo Del Toro, who plays a guy made mostly of dead people parts. I’m going to call him…Deadman.”The silence continues.“And you don’t want Sam to get caught in the rain or snow because it’s actually something called timefall, and it rapidly ages anything it touches. And there’s upside down rainbows, too. And bugs and dirt that fall up instead of down. And an unaging baby that you carry around on your chest who helps you see the dead people, who try to drag you away and bring you in contact with other dead things, which basically causes a nuclear explosion.”More silence.“But you’re not defenceless against the dead. You can use grenades made from your poop and pee, which gets collected whenever you go to the bathroom. But really, you want to try to avoid combat if you can, because violence is rarely an answer. Fighting definitely isn’t the focus.”Silence. Then slow clapping. Then one executive stands up and says, “You had us at delivery man.”I’m pretty sure the only person in the world who could have gotten a green light to make a big-budget, triple-A game out of these relentlessly weird ideas is Hideo Kojima. He’s earned mountains of good will from the industry and players alike thanks to his decades-long work on the beloved Metal Gear games, so why not see what he can do transforming The Walking Dead‘s Darryl into a glorified Amazon delivery guy?Actually, fans of Metal Gear will be happy to know that Death Stranding is surprisingly similar in tone and message. Expect plenty of lengthy, beautifully rendered, non-interactive narrative sequences that provide cryptic insights into the game’s complex characters and complicated world. You’ll also collect nearly a novel’s worth of text-based information in the form of endless emails and transcribed interviews that touch on subjects Kojima has always been fond of, from war and world politics to religion and relationships. And the game guru’s penchant for teasing multiple, thematic meanings out of simple words — such as “bridges” and the titular “stranding” — is at play throughout the story.Of course, not all of it works. There’s a sort of throw-everything-at-the-wall-and-see-what-sticks ethos here. Scattered among the narrative threads that resonate — such as an elderly man who muses heavily and effectively on immigration policy problems in pre-apocalypse America — are a handful of ideas that don’t quite stick their landing. The information network Sam is trying to build across America feels like it has some serious privacy issues, for example, and our ageless baby ghost detector feels conceived by someone who doesn’t understand the inherent connection between adults and infants.But it’s shocking just how much of it does work. And not just the narrative, but the action.You wouldn’t think a person could have much fun spending scores of hours (this is a very, very long game) simulating the life of a delivery man, but Kojima has made it oddly and undeniably compelling. The mechanics at play in controlling Sam’s centre of gravity by stacking stuff on his back and limbs based on size and weight are addictive. And shifting his weight by using the triggers to lean left and right — or simply grabbing his pack’s shoulder straps for a boost to stability — feels intuitive and right.There’s even a gratifying upgrade system composed of gear and abilities designed to gradually improve Sam’s porter attributes. You’ll eventually gain access to a variety of powered exoskeletal legs, futuristic stabilization gear, and better vehicles, as well as earning increases to strength and stamina stats that come from completing deliveries with a superlative rating, which earns Sam social media-style “likes” (essentially experience points).And slowly travelling across the ruins of America, from east to west, traversing an array of fields, streams, and snowy mountains, comes with a real sense of satisfaction and discovery. At times it almost feels like a puzzle. I’d begin deliveries by checking weather forecasts, then examine Sam’s map to plot the best route for a vehicle. If I reached terrain that was essentially impassible by a truck or bike, I’d pull out hovering carriers that I could attach to Sam’s back and load them up with essential cargo and gear, including ladders, ropes, and weapons and chart a new course to proceed on foot. It’s so weirdly captivating that of the millions who end up playing, I suspect at least a few will be nudged towards a career in logistics.You’ll also get to build roads, bridges, shelters, and other structures along the way, stitching together reliable paths between isolated survivors and communities. And these are shared with other players. You’ll discover signs and structures built by others, whose presence isn’t seen as much as felt — rather like what we’ve seen previously in the Dark Souls games.But it’s the discovery that’s grandest. You never know what might be over the next ridge. Perhaps someone’s lost cargo waiting to be found and delivered. Maybe a prepper bunker home to someone else waiting to be joined to the network Sam is building. Or it could be a rain storm, the time-altering droplets of which will cause your cargo containers to rapidly age even as you’re forced to tread more slowly to avoid the invisible dead, which tend to accompany precipitation.That brings us to combat, which, as you might have guessed, also bears Kojima’s idiosyncratic stamp. Your best bet is usually to avoid fighting if you can, but it’s hard because the spectral entities are more or less invisible, evident only through Sam’s baby’s otherworldly senses; creepy, thumping hand tracks that appear on the ground; and a disturbing visual effect that involves weeds growing and dying in the space of seconds. These scenes are always spooky and intense, with Sam crouching and holding his breath to avoid being detected.But sometimes battles must be fought. As I’ve already mentioned, Sam uses weapons constructed from his own body waste — which has special properties too complex to get into here — to fight the dead, making grenades and ammunition rare and valuable. You’ll also encounter groups of deranged one-time couriers who’ve become obsessed with capturing cargo who are intent on stealing Sam’s goods, but we’re told to have sympathy on these poor souls and to avoid killing them. I restricted myself to non-lethal weapons — bola guns and Sam’s fists, mostly — to render them unconscious. I truly tried to take Kojima’s pacifistic philosophizing to heart, so I don’t know what would have happened if I simply killed them.In the end, it might not be what we do in Death Stranding so much as the ideas that underlie the experience that make it so engaging, and make us so willing to overlook the elements that don’t quite work. Its grand — and timely — vision of how to unify a broken country; its take on killing only as a last resort; even its commentary on our culture’s growing reliance on having the world delivered to our doors. Kojima has given us lots to chew on.Which is perfect, since we have plenty of time to ruminate on what he has to say as we trudge across the continent, making America whole again one community at a time, being the very best delivery men we can be.

Death Stranding,Codi Spence,GamingTrend,https://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/a-journey-for-the-people-death-stranding-review/,"As time has passed, the world has become more and more connected. We went from being spread out with no way to communicate except in person to being able to communicate on the plethora of social media we have now. The point is that we have the power to communicate globally in an instant and that has made us stronger and more unified. Now, what if that idea of unification and connection was the main aspect behind a game’s premise? Look no further; take the theme of connection and mix it with some action-adventure gameplay, a fantastic cast, and a whole heap of Hideo Kojima’s trademark crazy style. That, my friends, is how we’ve discovered the Death Stranding.I’d like to say that Death Stranding is an interesting game, but I believe that’s drastically underselling it. The plot, although seemingly basic at first, gets stretched out and expanded upon as you embark on your journey. You play as Sam Porter Bridges, one of America’s brave porters (short for transporters) who makes his living off of delivering things for anyone in need. His knack for speedy deliveries and products in pristine condition has earned him a reputation as one of the best. Why is he so brave you may ask? That’s because a catastrophic event known as the Death Stranding has occurred, resulting in a massive casualty count, a deadly tar that absorbs most things that enter it, deadly creatures known as BTs manifesting, and America being torn apart (both literally and metaphorically).The company that Sam works for, Bridges, is attempting to reconnect America and form the United Cities of America in order to restore the country to what it once was. To do so, they sent out expedition teams to make contact with other communities and individuals in the hopes of connecting them to the system they call the Chiral Network. Think of it as a highly advanced version of the Internet. Sam has no interest in the future of the country, but it turns out that his dear friend Amelie got captured and held hostage on the West coast while she was with one of the expedition teams. Now, hands essentially tied, Sam reluctantly goes along with Bridges’ plan and heads West to finalize the connections to the Chiral Network, and get closer to saving Amelie.The game is open-world, so you’re able to travel pretty much wherever you want from the get-go. I say pretty much because there are some areas that you don’t get access to until later on when the story needs you to go there. That being said, wow is this world vast. From the flowing rivers to the steep mountains to the snowy hills to the wasteland-like fields, everything looks gorgeous, albeit it in a post-apocalyptic kind of way. There’s way more of a focus on nature in Death Stranding’s environment, with civilization sprinkled here and there. Those vast expanses added to the sense of disconnectedness and emptiness that America had been facing as a result of the Death Stranding. Be forewarned, you will be traveling a lot. For people who like the journey more than the destination, you’ll feel right at home, especially if you feel that pride of successfully making your way down an arduous path. Don’t worry though, after some time you’ll get access to some vehicles that help you get from place to place much quicker. That being said, you’ll still be walking and running quite a bit.Besides walking and running to complete deliveries, the gameplay does offer stealth sections, combat, and inventory management. The stealth sections are incredibly well done. As mentioned earlier, creatures called BTs have manifested. These are shadowy humanoid beings with long cords attached to them. One of your tools, the Odradek, will warn you when you’ve entered an area swarming with BTs. The Odradek looks like an extended version of a claw-machine claw combined with the front panel of a Ghost from Destiny. The Odradek will turn to face the closest BT and change colors, picking up speed as you get closer to them. When a good distance away, it stays blue and slightly moves, but when you get really close, it turns yellowish orange and starts opening and closing rapidly. In these situations you’ll want to crouch walk and hold your breath if the game prompts you to. The Odradek movement and noise doesn’t affect the BTs, so don’t worry about it getting you killed. If you make too much noise, they’ll discover that you’re there and attack. If you get caught, you’ll take damage and get dragged around in some tar by humanoid creatures. You can’t outrun the BTs, so don’t even try. The louder you get, the faster they’ll hone in on you, and believe me when I say that they are much faster than you.Early in the game, combat is going to be practically non-existent other than throwing some punches. As you progress, you’ll get access to an arsenal of weapons such as various types of grenades, assault rifles, handguns, shotguns, and more. That being said, this is not a guns-blazing type of game. There aren’t a lot of gunfights or battles, but the weapons are there to help you when you need them. They are most often used for defending yourself, but there are a few cases where you must go on the offensive. It’s better to discover the specifics during your playthrough, but I’ll vaguely mention that regular bullets aren’t the only ammunition you’ll get access to. The special ammunition was actually pretty neat to me when it came up during my playthrough.Now, as a porter, you’ll be tasked with carrying supplies to various destinations. You’ll also be able to carry your own assortment of weapons, along with tools such as ladders and climbing anchors, blood bags for healing, and much more. This isn’t your typical “cram an unrealistic amount of stuff into your inventory” type of game. Everything you carry has a weight to it, and that weight takes a toll on poor Sam. Sam can handle a hefty amount of weight, but he still has his limits. As you progress, he’ll be able to handle more weight and get better at doing so. Besides being slowed down as a result of the weight, Sam can also lose his balance. Quick movements can cause your cargo to sway, forcing Sam to balance himself out in order to avoid falling over. The more cargo you have on you, the harder it will be to stay balanced. This adds a whole new level of inventory management; now your inventory space actually impacts your gameplay. You also have to be careful with balance on slopes and hills, but thankfully you can hold down L2 and R2 in order to grip your backpack straps to steady yourself easier. Oh, and if you fall, not only will you take damage, but your cargo will as well. All objects have a durability that you’ve got to carefully maintain during deliveries, so keep that in mind.While out in the world, you’ll be able to find lost cargo and extra materials that you can take back to shelters. You can recycle the materials in order to stock up and use them to fabricate tools later on such as ladders, climbing anchors, PCC (a tool that you sacrifice in order to build something like a bridge or a generator), boots, vehicles, and much more. Quick note, I mention boots because your boots have a durability meter that drains as you walk on them. Once they get low and almost ruined, you’ll need to fabricate a new pair. The material cost is extremely low and you can always carry more than one extra pair, so it should never be an issue. Turning in lost cargo nets you extra experience to increase your level and also rewards you with likes. You earn experience from completing deliveries, and leveling up improves your ability to keep your balance, carry more cargo, earn more likes, and more.I’m sure you’re wondering what I mean by likes. It caught me off guard at first too, but turns out it’s a neat little concept. Likes help improve your connection level with NPCs in certain locations, which in turn increases the amount of materials you can store in a given location. This is helpful because every location has its own private storage locker and its own material storage. This limitation is more realistic and prompts you to do more for the people in that area if possible. Basically, since people appreciate your efforts, they’re more willing to help you out with more things. You can earn likes from NPCs by completing tasks and likes from other players by helping them out in their games. Oh…did I forget to mention that even in a single-player game, you can have an impact on someone else’s experience?The quasi-multiplayer aspect of Death Stranding was one of the most unexpected yet amazing things that they decided to try out. When you place a tool such as a ladder or climbing anchor or build a structure such as a bridge or generator in the world, it isn’t limited only to you. At any given time, even though you may not be able to see them, you may be playing alongside somebody else. You have no way to directly impact each other, but if you press the “call out” button, you’ll yell, and if you’re lucky, another nearby player may do the same and yell back to you. It’s fascinating knowing that in an odd way that you’re connected to other gamers even though you aren’t directly playing together. Seeing that somebody left behind a ladder to get up onto a ledge makes your life easier, so why not reward that ladder with a like? You may be fearful that the world of Death Stranding will become littered with tools once it fully releases, but fear not, the developers thought of that. It isn’t just one massive server, but a collection of them which helps alleviate any chance of overcrowding from tools and structures. There are also shared lockers at the shelters where you can deposit items for other players to find and use at their leisure. Again, that sense of community and unification rears its head, which I appreciated whole-heartedly.Related to the overcrowding concern, the game has a major feature to grapple with that concern: Timefall. At first, Timefall looks just like normal rain, and you may be tempted to want to play in it, but it isn’t and you shouldn’t. Timefall is another drastic effect of the Death Stranding. Whatever the raindrops touch gets fast-forwarded and more fragile as a result. That ladder you placed starts to get rusty faster, while the cargo containers you’re carrying start to decay and fall apart. Your skin, however, gets old and wrinkly in just a few seconds. Thankfully Sam always immediately wears his protective hood whenever it rains, so you don’t have to worry about protecting Sam in that regard. As I said, everything fast-forwards, but in terms of gameplay, the rate of accelerating decay is fairly lenient. You should still attempt to get out of the Timefall as quickly as possible in order to protect your gear and cargo, but you don’t have to worry about everything crumbling in your arms within a short time.I mentioned a fantastic cast earlier, and I need to reiterate how perfect everyone was for their roles. Norman Reedus as the tough adventurer with a hidden heart of gold, Guillermo del Toro as the researcher with an unnaturally joyful interest in the dead, and Troy Baker as a cocky antagonist, just to name a few. You can feel the emotion from their voices, whether they’re sad, angry, confused, and so on. The fact that everyone’s characters are modeled after their real life counterparts enables them to bring their characters to life to a much greater extent. Seeing Norman Reedus and hearing his voice is such a treat for fans of his. The same goes for the entirety of the main cast.Now, as a whole, it’s hard to narrow down my favorite thing about the game. That’s not to say it’s bad; in fact, it’s quite the opposite. I have so much to say about Death Stranding that I could talk for hours about it if prompted to. It made me laugh, cry, gasp in surprise, tense up in excitement, frustratingly mutter to myself at times, and even peacefully relax during the long “road trips” so to speak. For a game that at a glance looks to be about a man transporting goods in a ruined America, it had much more going on than you’d think. This game wasn’t what I was expecting it to be, but at the same time I’m so glad it wasn’t. Hideo Kojima and Kojima Productions hooked me in right away with their storytelling, multitude of interesting mechanics, and of course Kojima’s trademark brand of off-the-wall insanity. More than that, the main takeaway from the game, the main message of it all is what really stuck with me: We are all connected. We should be unified as a people, as a society, and as a community. No matter what stands in our way, if we stay strong, help one another out, and strive towards greatness as a unified force, then there’s nothing that we can’t accomplish. In the end, Death Stranding isn’t an action-adventure game about a man crossing the country in order to save his friend, it’s a social-connection game about one man and his comrades working together in order to bring people together again.Death Stranding is a story of rebuilding America by connecting people far and wide. Stealth, exploration, combat, and inventory management are all necessary in order to succeed. With a fantastic cast, incredible set pieces, an engaging story, and Kojima's brand of incredibly enjoyable crazy, you won't want to put your controller down.—Codi SpenceSee below for our list of partners and affiliates:One of the longest running independent gaming news, reviews and culture sites on the web.The thing that is magical about the Wizarding World isn’t the magic – it’s...by Ron BurkeThe world is going to end.

Death Stranding,Carli Velocci,Windows Central,https://www.windowscentral.com/death-stranding-pc-review,"No offers foundWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.When I received the code in my inbox for Death Stranding on PC, I'll admit I was excited to hop into the game again. I played it on PS4 back when it first came out and I spent weeks in its sprawling, dense, and sometimes obtuse world. There was something fascinating about it. It was partially the audacity of some of the narrative and gameplay elements — where else can you play a game where the main character's blood, urine, and feces creates weapons to take on dangerous ghosts — but it was also how pure it all was. Whether you like Hideo Kojima or not, you can't deny that this is a Kojima game down to its core.That Kojima stamp means we were going to get a game that was both a technical masterclass, introducing new ideas on how games can integrate multiplayer and online connectivity, and had a story that was up to its neck in its own nonsense. Death Stranding was a game of its moment. It was something that could take advantage of the PS4 to create a visual spectacle while also innovating on what was already there with unique multiplayer cooperation.As you walked across America (yes, that is a major plot point), you could see the capabilities of the PS4 in full bloom — the mountains rising in the distance, the river flowing around you as you crossed it, the snow crunching under your boots as you trudged uncomfortably to your destination. Players could see the intricacies in the mo-cap performances from the likes of Norman Reedus, Mads Mikkelsen, and Tommy Earl Jenkins. They could also feel the weight of everybody else playing with you since the game had a system of ""likes"" that allowed you to connect with your fellow players without the need for co-op strategizing or communicating.To sum it up, Death Stranding is a lot of game. So while I was looking forward to playing it again on PC, I was hesitant. Would I want to play through all of it again? As it turns out, playing it on PC is not only a great experience, but it allows players to play it on a new platform, which actually highlights some of the game's greatest strengths. There are new sidequests and cosmetics in the PC version to incentivize players to pick it up, but it's worth playing again for two reasons: the power of PC as a platform and how the game is more timely than ever before.Bottom line: Death Stranding came out in 2019 for the PS4, but the PC port looks to become the definitive version of the game thanks to improvements that make it playable across any type of machine. It's also, oddly enough, more relevant than ever.There were a lot of jokes made about Death Stranding when it first released in Nov. 2019. The premise of the game is confusing, and the details of how this world works are even more so. It posits a world where a horrible event called the Death Stranding caused everything to be overrun by dangerous ghosts called BTs, leading to the population flocking to cities or underground bunkers. The one thing keeping people together is a delivery system of porters that strap large crates to their backs and cross the dangerous landscape by foot. You play Sam Porter Bridges, a man whose new job is to reconnect America while also making deliveries.Even just a few months after Death Stranding released, however, we realized that the game was more on the nose than we originally thought. As most of the world entered quarantine due to the COVID-19 pandemic, not only social distancing but remaining in their homes, it became apparent that we would have to rely on delivery people, gig workers, and online retailers to get what we needed. Sure the people at the heart of treating the illness (doctors, nurses, etc.) made all headlines, but a lot of people putting their lives and health on the line were those making deliveries.There's also the connection aspect. The game utilizes a social media-esque like system where other players can give you ""likes"" based on the things you build. For example, if another player uses a ladder you left or liked a sign you placed, they can give you a number of likes. You don't get much by getting more likes beyond some tiny upgrades, but it's something that as a player, you long for. Just like on social media, validation of good deeds and work in Death Stranding is something you strive for even if it doesn't convert into any sort of currency. Our reliance on social media has also become stronger since the pandemic, meaning the communication in Death Stranding not only feels more relevant but also more in line with how we live day-to-day.This attachment to current events elevates Death Stranding, making its otherworldly and sometimes confusing story seem more palatable. The gameplay and technical aspects have always been its strong suit, not so much the story, which gets too caught up in worldbuilding details and repetitive exposition dumps to be truly relatable. Now there's a real-world connection that seems to change how we perceive the game entirely.It's funny because nothing foundational about the game has changed in the eight months since its first release. It's just that the logic obstacle course players had to jump through to understand what Kojima was doing is now a lot easier to conquer. It also makes the message at the heart of the game more powerful. Despite any nonsense about umbilical cords and pre-historic evolution that characters tell you are key to understanding Death Stranding, it's a story about connections, and how the little things we do can have wide-ranging consequences. Even something as small as a package can make a person's day or give them hope for something better. It's a direct counter to many post-apocalyptic games where humanity is expected to be cruel, which might be what players could use.This, in turn, might make the game appealing for those who've either never played it or might be thinking of a second playthrough.As I wrote in my preview of the game, Death Stranding is a powerful game that needs a powerful system to run. Whatever you might think of the PS4 at the end of this current generation and how capable it was, it was a strong-enough system to run the game with minimal issues. I recall the game crashing maybe twice in the 40+ hours of gameplay and that was on my regular, close to first-generation PS4. I got 1080p and 30FPS with little issue, and that's usually enough for most people.It's obvious that this game needs powerful tech to run. There's a lot of visual detail in both the landscape and in the close-up conversations between characters and it all needed to be rendered smoothly. The player as Sam needs to be able to run across the land without worrying about assets loading in as he goes. There need to be obstacles in his path so that walking feels as inconvenient as it actually is. You need to be able to see the minutiae in the mo-cap actors' performances or there wasn't a point in casting all the top-tier talent to deliver monologues or heavy exposition.Therein lies the main problem with Death Stranding on PC: You can only play it if you have the proper specs. You can see them below.For reference, I have a PC with an Intel i7-9700K CPU, 16GB of RAM, and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660. They're not the most top-tier specs, but they get the job in most cases. On the Death Stranding build I played for review (which was not the final one), I did experience some performance lag and some crashes. I had to put settings mainly on medium in order to get the game to run for more than a few seconds.The amount of options for the PC port means it's easier than ever to hit a place where you feel comfortable playing.Luckily the game, which is running on Guerilla Games' Decima Engine on PC, still looks incredible even on lower settings. Even on my settings, I could admire a looming mountain in the distance and if I set my mind to it, I know I could walk over to and climb that mountain. I didn't see any assets loading incorrectly or slowly, nor did I see much difference in the details and textures. There was maybe less grass in some areas, but I didn't feel taken out of the world at all. Water still flowed, rocks were still plentiful enough to trip me up, and trees were still properly tree-like. This was also the case with the console version, so it's nice to see how well the game runs transitioned over to PC.An interesting feature that I played around with quite a bit was in the frame rates, which could be adjusted all the way up to 240FPS. This made the game when I first booted it up look like a soap opera when you weren't in cut scenes — good ol' motion smoothing. This is most readily apparent when Sam moves. A smooth frame rate is important for ensuring that he moves the way you want to. It makes his walking more realistic, but it also allows the player to properly react when he trips or when he needs to adjust his balance. I put it on 120FPS during my run, and while sometimes his movement felt too smooth, it did give me the advantage I needed to not damage any deliveries with my clumsiness.So while most players won't notice a huge difference between 30 and 60FPS, the amount of options for the PC port means it's easier than ever to hit a place where you feel comfortable playing. It's also much easier to get to 60FPS, for instance, since even I was able to reach it easily on my mid-tier setup. Other options like the ability to use NVIDIA's DLSS (if you have a compatible graphics card) or FidelityFX CAS (if you don't) allow even lower-tier machines to reach comparable performance. It all ensures that no matter your machine, you can play the game, and sometimes even get spectacular performance as a result.This all leads to why I think that the PC might be the best platform for Death Stranding. It might be the most difficult to play the game on because of how much of your system it demands, but because of how most of us play on PC, the risks are worth it.I've been thinking a lot about how we play on PC vs. console can change our perspective. I spoke with developer Sam Barlow about Telling Lies, originally on PC, hitting consoles, and how that platform change can twist how the player engages with the scene. It's a game about eavesdropping on intimate conversations, and he noted how watching them play out a computer monitor was completely different than doing it on a TV.I was wowed by the game on PS4, but even more so now that I was seated directly in front of my monitor instead of a TV across the room.I had that in mind while I was playing Death Stranding on PC. I was wowed by the game on PS4, but even more so now that I was seated directly in front of my monitor instead of a TV across the room. I could pick out the details on the cryptobiotes, for example, and how the bugs' design is actually filled with a texture that makes eating them feel grosser. It was much easier to see rocks in the distance that I could swerve to avoid. I could pick out the subtleties in the actor's performance better, whether it's a change in their mood just by the look in their eyes or a slightly off piece of body language that reveals more about them before their backstory dump does.On a more concrete level, there's also the difference between a mouse and keyboard and a controller. Death Stranding has a lot of inputs to remember, and with a keyboard, you have more options for key binding. This could be confusing for some, but I found myself being able to remember the controls easier on a keyboard since I could have a button for everything I wanted to do, which isn't exactly the case with a controller. The PC version does allow you to play with a controller though, so you can still play whichever way feels more comfortable.A lot of whether you'll buy Death Stranding or PC obviously comes down to platform preference, but there's something to be said about being just a few inches from the action on your computer monitor, to notice all the tiny details that were key to this game, that makes the PC port special. The fact that the game can be run on a lot of machines despite the high specs required means it can reach even more players.There are a couple content differences between the two versions. The PC one has the Valve crossover content, which includes cosmetics, sidequests, and a little backstory that ties both Valve and the world of Death Stranding together. They don't change up much of the foundation of the game, but some of the cosmetics are fun, and you get a version of the Gravity Gloves that allow you to pick up objects up to 15m away.I can understand not wanting to get back into Death Stranding, especially if you're played it already. It's a huge game in terms of the size of the landscape you have to cross, the scope of the narrative, and just how long it is. It's heavy and dense, and for some, the story might come across as too nonsensical to be worthwhile.However, The game has only become more relevant in the eight months since its initial release on the PS4, and therefore comes off differently. The PC port also manages to make it fairly easy to play, even if you don't have the most powerful machine. Whether you want to experience it for the first time or want to replay it on a different platform (the Half-Life and Portal tie-ins on PC don't change a lot of the game's foundation, but are charming nonetheless), there's something here for you.A game for 2020A PC port to define all PC portsDeath Stranding came out in 2019 for the PS4, but the PC port looks to become the definitive version of the game. If you haven't played this title yet, it's worth trying out on PC.Carli is the Gaming Editor and Copy Chief across Windows Central, Android Central, and iMore.

Death Stranding,Dan Dawkins,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/nov/01/death-stranding-review-playstation-4-pc-kojima-gameplay,"PS4, PC; Sony / Kojima ProductionsWith technically brilliant gameplay that denies instant gratification, Kojima’s uncompromising game is this year’s most interesting blockbuster by farFor almost three and a half years, Death Stranding has kept us guessing about its true nature – and when the credits roll after a gruelling, occasionally magical, 60 hours of delivering parcels-turned-metaphors, you won’t know whether to laugh or cry with relief. Divisive creator Hideo Kojima’s open-world epic resolves its mysteries, but your satisfaction is numbed by painful memories of relentless trekking, jarring menu management and some – frankly wild – tonal shifts. Over time, your relationship with Death Stranding may start to shift, but it’s a slow-burn album track, not a pop hit.Your feelings about Hideo Kojima’s longest, most indulgent, project will hinge on how you buy into the game’s theme about the importance of belief when all seems futile. About 80% of your time is spent trudging across mountains delivering parcels. Imagine Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos atoning for his sins in an especially cruel episode of Black Mirror. At times, the act of playing Death Stranding is a test of faith in itself, not only in Hideo Kojima’s ability to surprise, but that your efforts will ultimately be rewarded.For reasons unknown, America has been fractured by the Death Stranding event, causing the dead to roam the world of the living as shadowy spectres known as the beached things, or BTs. People have retreated into isolated communities and your job is to deliver supplies and reconnect the chiral network – a mega-internet – to unite the country. You need to cross the shattered landscape and find the president’s daughter Amelie who has been abducted by terrorists called the Homo Demens. There’s obviously more going on, as hero Sam Bridges (Norman Reedus) unearths his past, and learns about the mysterious Cliff (Mads Mikkelsen) and your ghost detecting pod-baby, BB.Death Stranding defies convention, focusing on “connection” over combat and (almost) removing the notion of restarting a mission when things go wrong. Case in point: I failed to plan a delivery route and got swamped by BTs, who wrecked my cargo. Having never so much as dented a parcel in the game’s opening hours, the sight of 10 cases being ruined provokes blind panic bordering on remorse. My instinct is to quit and restart the task, but while lost items can be picked up later from a delivery centre, if a cargo is destroyed beyond repair, it’s lost forever. It’s in this moment that Death Stranding is born, as you resolve to push on with a nagging sense of failure, unable to reset and start fresh.Eight hours in, I hadn’t shot a single person. The challenge comes from the surprisingly engaging cargo management, where you trade weight against balance, speed against stamina, and weigh up risky shortcuts over treacherous terrain. Once you adjust, holding L2 and R2 to grab your backpack navigates most scenarios and sloppiness is the threat, for example sprinting into deep water without scanning its depth. The ghost-evading BT sections require stealth, but won’t tax Metal Gear Solid (MGS) veterans. Mules are the main human enemy, and easily dealt with by using basic kicks and punches (all on one button) and a simple evade system. You’ll unlock new kit as you progress, such as “bola” cable tie guns, further reducing the threat.Hideo Kojima’s liberation from the MGS series can feel like X-Men’s Cyclops removing his visor and having a good old look around – it’s a little much. Think 2001, The Road, The Leftovers, Silent Hill and Planet Earth reinterpreted as three days of UPS contract work. Death Stranding pulverises the player with its overwhelming scale, seemingly unending objectives and fastidious resource management. Yet, despite everything, the game somehow pulls you through, creating a cycle of punishment and reward in a technically brilliant blockbuster experience quite unlike anything that has come before.The opening hours of the game are cut-scene heavy, creating intrigue that just about drives you forward to the point when you’re 35 hours in and losing the will to zigzag up another vertical slope. Initially, Death Stranding’s barren world makes you feel the weight of every footstep, until the dizzy liberation of unlocking your first bike and whizzing along miles of broken ground in a heartbeat. Later on, you’ll find vans which stop your parcels degrading in the rain and upgrades that make a mockery of the game’s early simplicity.The much-touted “strand” system is a form of collaborative online play, where you can share items with other players, leave pre-set warning signs, and contribute resources to construction projects. You never see your fellow porters, but their items and cargo litter your world. Building your first bridge sparks mild euphoria at never having to tiptoe across a wild river again. Later in the game, players can pool materials to form motorways, and reward players’ philanthropy with likes.Over time, the thrill of acquiring hi-tech items yields to a pang of regret. Other players’ emoji signs litter distribution centre entrances in the quest for cheap likes, and rugged landscapes start to resemble red-light districts. You start to crave undiscovered delivery routes for a reminder of the game’s unspoilt beauty. Thematically, it’s pretty overt: mankind’s attempt to tame nature – through selfishness, or selflessness – is storing up an environmental problem.Death Stranding’s focus on meticulous cargo preparation and deliveries that trigger repetitive, intrusive, micro cut-scenes, feel designed to provoke fluster in a world of instant gratification. Parents will shiver at the familiarity – and necessity – of equipment preparation, as if packing a bag for a day out. The game’s views on social media are at best nuanced, at worst conflicting. Death Stranding laments social media’s lack of human connection yet rewards players with a dopamine-volcano of stats after each mission, unlocking new equipment, creating a cycle of dependency.The motion-captured performances are exceptional, even if arch villain Higgs (Troy Baker) makes Jared Leto’s Joker look subtle. The game’s exhilarating finale – long enough to be a game itself – remixes some of MGS’s greatest moments, but this deadens the impact for hardcore Kojima fans. The final act shakes things up, but the gruelling 15-20-hour mid-section is a seemingly endless toil of literal hills and valleys, rather than emotional highs and lows.Despite everything, you keep going. Arduous ascents succumb to the undeniable impact of a stunning vista framed by an inverted rainbow. Your brain starts to blur the journey and focus on fleeting moments of reflection, pride and relief. Death Stranding’s mesmerising scale and repetition starts to weigh on your subconscious. Kojima’s games have always thrived in the empty space that other games seek to eradicate – such as the legendary ladder climb in MGS3, or MGSV’s infamous Act 2 – and, for almost 20 hours, it feels like Death Stranding is taking that to clumsy extremes to hammer home a point about society’s excesses and its unsustainability.In a recent interview, Mad Max director George Miller suggested Death Stranding was too radical for its time. “The risk is that people don’t accept it,” he said. Sceptics will feel vindicated by the game’s bloated indulgence and repetition, while the plot doesn’t quite live up to the wildest speculation by Kojima’s hardcore acolytes.Still, this uncompromising, unashamedly political work of artistic intent is 2019’s most interesting blockbuster game by a distance, and certainly the only one where you will find a frankly brilliant, tonally jarring, Public Enemy gag.Your relationship with Death Stranding will likely shift in waves. After the strain of uncovering the game’s mysteries has subsided, you’ll discover new ways to traverse the world. You find yourself yearning to return, the elegiac soundtrack decorating your idle thoughts. I have resolved to deliver every parcel, despite cursing their existence for 60 hours.Above all, Death Stranding is a sermon on the importance of belief. The power of putting one foot in front of another when hope looks lost, in the belief that things will get better. By working together, a series of small intentional steps can make a difference, and in this often fractured, angry and confusing world; that’s as hopeful as it gets.Death Stranding is released by Sony on 8 November.

Death Stranding,Francesco De Meo,Wccftech,https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-pc-uniting-world/,"What Death Stranding truly is, it is hard to say. Is it just a cataclysm that changed the world? Is it just a video game that took the industry by storm, featuring unusual mechanics that are deeply tied to the game's world and its lore? Is it a warning for a bleak future? Is it an experience that is unlike any other in entertainment as a whole? It's all this. And much more.Eight months after its PlayStation 4 debut, Death Stranding finally launches on PC, complete with new graphics options and minor additional content inspired by the Half-Life series that, while welcome, does not fundamentally change the way the game plays. If you have played the game on PlayStation 4 and did not like its unique experience, you won't like it any better on PC, even though the additional graphics options do make the experience better than it ever was on console.Death Stranding's main appeal is his complex, deep, and thought-provoking story. Years before the beginning of the game, a terrible cataclysm called the Death Stranding changed the face of the world forever. Cities all over were destroyed, countless people died and those who survived had to deal with the consequences of the apocalypse. Most of all, the survivors became isolated, and communities were essentially closed to the outside world due to the dangers that now plague the world, like Timefall, a rain that essentially moves time forward for both organic and inorganic matter, and the mysterious BTs, who are linked to the other world in ways that man still has to understand. The only ones who make life possible in such a world, braving these dangers, are porters. And one of these porters has the chance to set things right and bring forth a tomorrow worth living in. This porter is Sam Porter Bridges.Right from the very beginning, the Death Stranding story is incredibly gripping. In true Hideo Kojima fashion, it is a complex and sometimes hard to follow story that hits hard a lot of times and pays off beautifully, despite uneven pacing that does leave things hanging for a bit too long before resolving them. While themes like isolation, the nature of human interaction and the need to reconnect people are always were as relevant in November as they are today, they resonate much better now with the current state of the world, as many of the issues we are dealing with are the same the people of the United Cities of America are, making the story, possibly, even more engaging. Hideo Kojima has always been a keen observer of society, predicting the future several times in the past, but, with Death Stranding, he hits home incredibly hard.The engrossing story is made even better by the way it is sold. Being a Hideo Kojima game, no one will be surprised to see 20 minute long cutscenes, but the superb directing and the excellent acting make them a joy to experience. Norman Reedus' performance as Sam Porter Bridges stands out as extremely solid, but there are a lot of standout performances, Lea Sidoux's performance as Fragile, Mads Mikkelsen's as Cliff and Troy Baker's as Higgs. The cast has simply done marvelous work that deserves to be celebrated as among the best ever seen in video games.The amazing story of Death Stranding leads to gameplay that is unlike anything we have seen so far. Its uniqueness also made it extremely polarizing, as Sam's journey to make America whole again is not a journey for everyone: you'll either love it or hate it.Being a member of Bridges, one of the few delivery companies still active in the game's dystopian world, Sam will have to journey through America from the East to the West Coast to deliver goods that cannot be created using extremely advanced 3D printers like food and other supplies as well as items from the pre-Death Stranding world like CDs, books and movies, items that are extremely important to reconnect humanity to its past and recreate a lost sense of identity. The post-apocalyptic United States are represented with a massive open-world that resembles Iceland more than the actual North American continent: it is a wild land that is very difficult to traverse.At the very beginning of the game, Sam Bridges doesn't have a whole lot of tools at his disposal: he can carry cargo on his back, he can analyze the terrain with his scanner and he can use the Cuff Links to check out the map to plan the route, rearrange the cargo on his back and check emails that often provide additional info on the story and characters. The first three episodes feel like a massive tutorial, as most of the mechanics and tools are introduced progressively in these episodes so as to not overwhelm players. This, unfortunately, results in extremely slow-pacing that will make more than a few players give up on the game, as all you will be doing for the first 10 hours or so is literally walk from one settlement to the next to complete some very simple deliveries whose only difficulty is making sure Sam doesn't lose balance and damage the cargo. There is a ranking system that evaluates performance, providing some incentives in the form of experience that can improve Sam's abilities, but it's nothing particularly exciting. Those who persevere regardless, however, will find that Death Stranding isn't just a walking simulator.While the basic experience, in all honesty, doesn't change a whole lot during the course of the 40 hours required to see the ending, despite the progressive introduction of vehicles and roads, it is made much more engaging over time by a couple of very interesting mechanics that will surely make an impact on open-world games moving forward. Chief among them are the social gameplay mechanics, which elevate the whole experience to incredible heights.Once the first few deliveries have been completed, Sam will be able to craft PCC, Portable Chiral Constructors, which allow him to build structures outside of settlements and cities. These structures allow players not only to access a variety of services like storing cargo, recharging batteries for vehicles and Leg Skeletons, and so on, but also to make traveling easier, creating bridges and so on. Better yet, these structures will also appear in other players' games so that they can use them freely, even if they did not build them directly. Players automatically leave a like to the builder when they use any of these facilities or if they climb a ladder or use a climbing anchor left by another, but they can also choose to give multiple ones manually as a sign of appreciation. These likes aren't just for show, as they count towards Bridge Link progress that, once leveled up, improved certain abilities. The best thing about this system is how deeply tied to the game's world and lore: it's no gimmick at all. And it makes traversing this desolate landscape feel less like a chore, as receiving unexpected appreciation from other players gives you a boost that goes beyond simple abilities improvement.While Death Stranding mostly involves a lot of solitary walking, there are some gameplay mechanics that require a more hands-on approach. Combat is not the main focus here, and it is not all that well-developed as well: it is the last measure if every other option proved to be ineffective. MULEs, rogue porters who let all the delivering get to themselves, have set up camps all over the map, and getting near them will trigger a scan that will tag your cargo and let them know where you are. At this point, you can either make a quick escape or fight them head-on. Combat is very straightforward, with a decent selection of lethal and non-lethal weapons ranged weapons that can take down MULEs easily. As they always come in droves, however, it is always better to pick them off one by one, if you really need to fight them.Stealth is always the better option if you really want to pillage the MULE camps for materials and other items. At the same time, these rogue porters are extremely smart, and can see you coming from a long way, especially if you are carrying a lot of cargo on your back. Stealth options have a lot of Metal Gear Solid V in them, feeling like an evolution of the systems seen in the last entry of the Konami series, so if you enjoyed that game, chances are you are ready to sneak into MULE camps unnoticed.Stealth is also extremely important when dealing with BTs, the otherworldly presences that roam North America and made it almost impossible to travel.  These creatures, which are always preceded by a Timefall pour, cannot be fought head-on: if they catch Sam, they will try to bring him to the Beach, another mysterious place that has appeared before humanity following the Death Stranding. Being a Repatriate, Sam cannot die, but you will lose cargo and will have to start your current quests all over again. Thankfully, it is not to difficult to slip past them unnoticed, thanks to the help of BB, a baby placed inside a pod that allows Sam's Odradek Scanner to pinpoint the general location of BTs. After a certain point in the story, you will be able to fight and kill BTs if you so desire, but the noise you make while shooting them down or using grenades can alert others nearby, so it's not recommended unless absolutely necessary. Non-violence is a recurring theme in Death Stranding, and the fact that it is clearly reflected on the gameplay is a testament to the game's great attention to detail. There really is no disconnect between story and gameplay.While there are a lot of different options for stealth, combat, and deliveries, it is undeniable that Death Stranding becomes repetitive after a while. Most deliveries can be completed without encountering any enemy, and the only difficulty lies in navigating harsh terrain or finding the shortest route. As such, there are times when the game feels like a real chore to play and only the story manages to drive players forward. Thankfully, there is plenty of that, as even most side-deliveries aren't just here to inflate the already large playtime but to help develop a plethora of side characters that provide more details on life after the Death Stranding and their own personal struggles in the game's cruel and hard world.Powered by the Decima Engine, Death Stranding already looked great on PlayStation 4, but it will never compare to how good the game can look on PC. For starters, Death Stranding is extremely undemanding, for today's AAA standards, and it manages to scale well on a lot of different system configurations. On the machine used for the test, which features an i7-3770 CPU, GTX 980 Ti GPU, and 16 GB RAM, the game run effortlessly at 1440p, 60 FPS with high settings enabled. Increasing the resolution to 4K obviously tanked performance, but it was definitely playable at 30 FPS. The owners of the NVIDIA RTX GPU family can also take advantage of DLSS 2.0 support, which makes the game look even better. No matter what your system configuration is, you will be able to play Death Stranding with an acceptable quality and performance level.Extreme care has been placed in sound and music as well. Death Stranding features amazing voice acting, and it couldn't have been any other way with Hollywood-grade actors and wise placement of music. While most of the moment-to-moment gameplay features no music, licensed tracks for a variety of artists are used to highlight specific sequences, such as when close to reaching a new city, giving off an extremely nice cinematic feel even outside of cutscenes.Death Stranding on PC is as polarizing as it is on PlayStation 4, being pretty much the same game. Nonetheless, it is Hideo Kojima at his very best, an extremely coherent artistic vision that is definitely not everyone's cup of tea. The best way to enjoy Death Stranding is to approach it with a very open mind and treat it for what it is: a journey into the deepest reaches of the human mind that is not always going to be pleasant.Code provided by the publisher.With production values that are through the roof and an extremely engaging story, Death Stranding is among Hideo Kojima's best games. The moment-to-moment gameplay, however, falls short due to its repetitiveness, and the long stretches without any real action make it difficult to recommend the game to all open-world fans. Death Stranding is something different, and only approaching it with an open mind will reveal the brilliance of its themes, its characters and its hauntingly beautiful dystopian world.Subscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox© 2023 WCCF TECH INC.

Strap in, BB.Death Stranding has been a long time coming, born from the ashes of the fabled PT project – a stealth Silent Hills game – which also included a collaboration with Konami's Metal Gear Solid mastermind Hideo Kojima, The Walking Dead's Norman Reedus and Pan's Labyrinth director Guillermo Del Toro.Since 2016, the game has been teasing everything from beached whales to capsuled babies, an oily Mads Mikkelsen, squid tanks, Conan O'Brien cameos, box carrying, floating ghosts, mysterious handprints and so much more. But what the heck does it all actually mean? Are the answers actually interesting? And most importantly, does it all add up to a good game? Well, we've spent a solid 56 hours trawling through Kojima's barmy new creation, which promised to birth a new game genre, as he did with Metal Gear Solid's stealth gameplay, and sadly, the answer isn't a pleasant, or simple, one.Death Stranding casts you as Sam Porter Bridges (Norman Reedus), a delivery man with a fear of being touched. He's tasked by the President to travel across America to link lots of different cities (Knots) to the chiral network – essentially the internet – in a bid to reconnect society and help them battle ghostly BTs.What are BTs exactly? Not that catchy Korean boy band. They're Beached Things, dead people whose souls are trapped in purgatory since the Death Stranding event. To get across America, Sam also has to handle Timefall, rain which ages you, and MULES, crazed enemies who became so obsessed with delivering packages they went mad. Of course.Sam can see BTs using his Bridge Baby or BB, which allows him to scan for the ghostly enemies. He's supported by a pretty A-list cast, mostly BB expert Deadman (with the likeness of Guillermo Del Toro but voiced by Jesse Corti). Then there's tech expert Mama (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood's Margaret Qualley), along with rival porter Fragile (James Bond's Léa Seydoux) and a looming enemy played by Mads Mikkelsen.While there is some explanation in the game as to why society has to rely on people manually lugging heavy items around – namely the lack of Chiral Network coverage and putting the population out of work – it's still quite hard to believe. Shop now Death Stranding Standard Edition (Higgs Variant)This society has holograms everywhere, delivery robots and the ability to 3D print almost anything. You think they could work an easier way to make deliveries happen, even just to save poor Norman Reedus slipping a disc. There's also an endless supply of Monster Energy in Sam's room, so why not get them to deliver some boxes too, eh?Death Stranding's biggest questions are answered in classically long-winded Kojima cut scenes. But sadly, it still leaves a lot of exposition to be read in lengthy emails and interviews, which is even a step down from Metal Gear Solid V's laborious audio tapes. These notes are what truly pad out the world and the bland characters you deliver to. To go into much more depth would spoil the complicated plot – one of its best elements. But themes cover allegories for reconnecting people, working together, gun violence and the futility and motivation to continue our very existence. Yes, very lofty, but you're still carrying around a lot of boxes.The two major gameplay elements of Death Stranding are traversal and combat. Traversal largely involves stacking boxes on Sam's back – thankfully there's an auto-stack option – then delivering said boxes. Although the boxes' contents descriptions vary massively from bombs to underpants, for all you can see, they're just plain boxes.It gets easier lugging it all around after the first 4-6 hours, as you're kitted out with exoskeletons, an automated drone and stronger weight limits as you upgrade. You're also given a futuristic motorbike, truck and floating carrier to help you along the way. The carrier can be especially fun, as it allows you to hoverboard down mountains, if you can avoid smashing into rocks… or a BT.There is a fast travel option later, but of course, you can't take cargo with you. Shop now Death Stranding Standard Edition (Higgs Variant)When riding in transport, you'll be wrestling with the L2 and R2 triggers in order to keep Sam's tower of packages under control and avoid snapping the poor bloke in half. Plus you'll need to manage his stamina bar, which drains quicker the more you carry. Sadly, the map system in Death Stranding is incredibly complex and hard to read. You have location markers, your own and other players' structures all marked in the same light shade of blue. Then there's path markers, rain and tiny white writing to contend with, which overall makes discerning your destination incredibly difficult. Hopefully Kojima Productions can fix this with colour coding, or options to toggle on-or-off map markers with some early updates, as it would make a huge difference.Your first trek to a location is always the hardest, as before you link the areas to the Chiral Network, the various ladders, ropes, bridges, ziplines, shelters and safe houses won't appear on your map unless you physically find them first.You can dish out Likes to items left by other players, however it's currently unclear if only the most popular items will remain on maps, as it could get pretty clogged once Death Stranding goes on mass release. Items degrade from the Timefall rain, so eventually all items will break down, if they're not repaired.Repairs are one of the best elements of the asynchronous multiplayer, as you can all contribute materials to auto-building machines, which create huge roads that span the whole map, making it much easier to access. Lots of reviewers collaborated to make a road during the first section of our play-through, then seemingly gave up. Hopefully everyone else will be a bit more diligent, as when we contributed to the roads, we received thousands of likes each time it was used.Shop now Buy Death Stranding special edition PS4Death Stranding has a fair amount of combat. Sam can unlock new weapons and equipment from customers he delivers to, in a very similar fashion to MGSV's Mother Base. The more you deliver to one person, the better version of the kit you get.You have two options when facing BTs – sneak past by holding your breath or take them on directly. While it's fairly similar taking on ghostly BT apparitions, if their oily minions manage to grab you and pull you into their spooky tar pit, you'll be dragged into an incredible hellscape, which tasks you with fighting monstrous beasts while traversing dead fish and floating buildings.This is easily one of the coolest parts of Death Stranding, along with the few boss battles strewn amongst the game. It would have been great to have seen more of them, especially given Kojima's penchant for a clever boss twist. But sadly, there's only a handful of scripted battles throughout the game.The game discourages you from firing normal bullets, instead Sam's blood, sweat, wee and poop can be used to combat the BTs. Again, yep, really. These are all collected from Sam while he rests at his base, meanwhile his blood is synthesised and carried in blood packs. Your blood-infused grenades and bullets will drain Sam's blood bar, which also doubles as his health bar. You'll be kitted out with a host of blood-infused machine guns, pistols, shotguns and rocket launchers throughout the game. Plus most have non-lethal options for incapacitating MULES and Homo Demens – terrorists who looks similar to MULES.If you do kill a human enemy, or die yourself while fighting a BT tar monster, there's some huge repercussions to the game world, which we won't spoil in this review. But suffice to say, it's graphically impressive and hammers home the player's impact on the world. Fans of MGSV will be very familiar with the look and feel of Death Stranding's mechanics. The graphics engine (Decima) has been tweaked to look near-identical to the stealth title; equipment menus and animations are also eerily familiar. Some character designs could be plucked straight from the classic series, from the mindless balaclava-clad MULES who try to rob you, to the automated delivery robots, which could be big brothers to MGS4's Humanoid Dwarf Gekkos.But that's no bad thing. The Decima engine, which gave us titles like Horizon: Zero Dawn, is beautiful, and emulating the looks of the FOX engine is no bad move. Character models look incredibly realistic with some performances – particularly Presidential advisor Die Hardman – delivering some convincing emotional weight, especially in the game's closing moments. Elsewhere, the landscapes are truly impressive, from Mars-like crumbling landscapes to green grassy plains, mountainous valleys intersected with streams and rivers, and best of all, thick blizzardy snow drifts, complete with whiteouts and landslides.Sadly, Death Stranding's world is largely empty, which admittedly fits the aesthetic and plot of the game, but aside from some MULES, BTs or shacks to deliver to, you won't see much else in the enormous map.Death Stranding has a great soundtrack. Once you start covering serious ground on a bike or floating carrier, Low Roar's huge range of tracks will kick in. There's also songs from Bring Me the Horizon, Chvrches and Major Lazer randomly making up the playlist in Sam's bedroom and the end credits. It might have been nice to allow players to play their own tracks, a bit like Metal Gear Solid's tape player – if an item like this does exist in the game, we haven't found it yet – but generally when a track kicks in as Sam solitarily trudges across the huge landscape, it makes for a beautiful and immersive experience.Shop now Death Stranding Standard Edition (Higgs Variant)Despite the A-list voice cast, it's probably Troy Baker's Higgs and Tommie Earl Jenkins's Die Hardman who deliver the best performances in the game. Norman Reedus is deliberately understated or mute throughout, but most side missions see him bizarrely silent, as if the actor didn't record enough dialogue for those sections.The biggest problem for Death Stranding is that the bulk of the gameplay has you manually lugging masses of near-identical crates across the massive map, to drop at identical warehouses for lots of bland holographic side characters. As HUGE Metal Gear Solid and Kojima fans, we were really hoping Death Stranding would be his magnum opus, but overall its story is bloated, lacks his kooky Kojima magic and the overall gameplay just isn't fun enough.There are definitely some really interesting ideas and concepts surrounding the core gameplay – mainly the asynchronous multiplayer, and perhaps this could evolve more once the world has access, a bit like his nuclear disarmament idea from Metal Gear Online.While Death Stranding creates interesting allegories for rebuilding America, connecting with strangers and working together towards a common goal, it's far from an Earth-shattering new genre some have hoped for. Tragically, the novel multiplayer element is underused and under-applied in the overall game.Shop now Buy Death Stranding special edition PS4It pains us to say this, but Death Stranding is more like an elaborate sim for being a one-man Amazon Prime delivery service for the whole of America. Despite the beautiful graphics, masterful soundtrack, solid voice acting and fun combat, it's not enough to counterbalance how much of a chore lugging around boxes is. Perhaps the most interesting part of Death Stranding's legacy will be the fascinating and barmy hype train we've all been riding for the last few years. It's certainly been a fun ride, but the destination wasn't worth the wait.Death Stranding release date: November 8, 2019Available on: PS4, Microsoft WindowsDeveloper: Kojima ProductionsPublisher: Sony Interactive Entertainment Digital Spy reviewed Death Stranding on a standard PlayStation 4 console.Buy Death Stranding on PlayStation 4Digital Spy is launching a newsletter – sign up to get it sent straight to your inbox.Want up-to-the-minute entertainment news and features?

Death Stranding,Timothy Nunes,PlayStation Universe,https://www.psu.com/reviews/death-stranding-ps4-review/," Timothy Nunes / November 9, 2019As the credits rolled on Death Stranding, I found myself swimming in emotions and theories. The last half of the game took me for a ride that I will not soon forget, something I fully expect from a game created by Hideo Kojima–outside of Metal Gear Solid V, anyway. In fact, the way that Death Stranding’s finale shaped up completely justified all 61 hours I spent getting there. Traditionally, I begin my review writing process soon after completing a game, and oftentimes I begin writing my first draft the same night.Not with Death Stranding: Too much took place in 61 hours for me to even consider writing in the limelight the ending created.Editor’s Note: The following paragraph will be the only specified story beats this review includes. These only occur in the first few hours of Death Stranding.The last President of The United States, President Bridget Strand, calls upon Sam Porter Bridges to utilize his skills as a porter, a parcel delivery person, to reconnect a shattered country. His other initiative is to seek out President Strand’s daughter, Amelie, who is on the other side of the country, and bring her back East. Along the way, he must find different ways to introduce the Chiral Network to people he comes across and convince them to connect themselves to the network. In doing so, the country, as well as the individuals, gain access to shared knowledge and resources, using their Chiral Printers (3D printers) to generate equipment, weapons, and technology needed to help bring life back to a kind of normal after the Death Stranding.It goes without saying that Death Stranding is a Hideo Kojima title through and through. This means that lengthy cutscenes, plot twists, cinematic references, current events, and cutting-edge visuals all compile the complete package, laced liberally with spontaneous cheeky humor. A very generous amount of time is spent in the early hours of the game establishing the setting and the circumstances that have created it. What makes all of this better is the list of cameos that appear throughout the game, and said cameos’ performances even more so.Not many movies have such an all-star cast as Death Stranding does. Combining Mads Mikkelson, Norman Reedus, Léa Seydoux, and Tommy Earl Jenkins is already a tall order, but you also see voice actor extraordinaire, Troy Baker, join the fray. Holy hell, does Baker steal the show in every moment he appears! Higgs, Baker’s bastard of a character, has both stellar writing and impeccable acting behind him, creating an absolutely fantastic villain.All of these cameos aren’t gimmicks, either. Each character has his or her moment to shine. Most tragic, some heartfelt, some melancholy, but they all hit home stupendously. This holds true for many side characters as well. Even in small moments, they all etch out their very own fondness in the greater narrative whole.Character code names all play a part in this as well. All of them carry into Death Stranding’s pursuits of allegory, some deep and hidden, some point-blank and peculiar, and others surprising. Some examples being Heartman, Mama, and Die-Hardman, the intentions behind these names all become clear during their respective backstories. From time to time, some of these allegorical attempts get heavy-handed and out of place; fans of Metal Gear Solid 4, be prepared for a line similar to “You were the lightning in that rain.”As mentioned before, the first three episodes take up a huge chunk of time. Unfortunately, most of that time is spent running around, trying to learn how to play the game. In hindsight, I appreciated having that time to learn while not having that learning process distract from the more important narrative beats. Though enabling a leisurely pace, the lack of gameplay focus in the first three episodes will leave a lot of wavering players feeling cold.Something I could never quite get over during my time with Death Stranding were the endorsements. Well, I can’t say for sure if they were endorsements, but their presentations within the game certainly gave that impression. Including a famous drink is one thing I ultimately came to terms with, but almost blatantly advertising a real-life TV channel left a bad taste in my mouth. I’m sure many will enjoy this little Easter Egg, considering the actor playing the main character, but I couldn’t help but see this part of the game like decorating a race car with endorsements stickers.From the very first microsecond of playing Death Stranding, you see absolutely gorgeous landscapes. Hell, the first couple shots in the opener had me wondering if the scenes were computer-generated or real life captures. I have to wonder how much time went into creating the maps of this post-apocalypse America, simply because so many landscapes stopped me dead with eyes wide and mouth agape. Considering the in-house engines Sony granted Kojima Productions, it’s no wonder the final product looks mesmerizing.It would be a lie to say that the vast, vast majority of gameplay wasn’t carrying packages around the map, because it is that simple–on paper. In order to be truly successful, you must utilize all your resources, as well as your techniques, to not only deliver goods but do so as quickly as possible. Some methods are much easier than others, but when on foot, you must consider a few things as you go. Little footfalls in the ground can trip you if move too quickly, for instance, or lingering too long in a Timefall storm will deteriorate your shipments past deliverable quality.Very early on, you come across Timefall. Mimicking rain, Timefall falls from the sky and rapidly ages anything it touches. Timefalls don’t affect you as the player, because you come equipped with a protective jumpsuit. However, Timefall slowly degrades the quality of your shipments. While they are made of Timefall-resistant materials, you still need to find ways out of Timefall quickly so the quality of your haul isn’t diminished.In Death Stranding, patience is not so much a virtue as it is a necessity. This stands doubly true for the first three episodes, which lasted around 35 hours for my first playthrough. While that is just over half of the time I needed to finish all fourteen episodes, I did spend an almost embarrassing amount of that time galavanting between delivery points on foot when I didn’t need to. The game offers plenty of different ways to get around the map, with upgrades and new equipment popping up basically after every delivery you complete for the first while.Death Stranding does a wonderful job of minimally directing you to the next thing, whether that is a new means of transportation, gear, or strategy. It never tells you what to do, but when you get around to trying something, the game tells you how to do it. Everything has a tutorial body of text, and that text only appears when you start to use or interact with said thing. All in all, while the game delivers (ha) plenty of optional goodies to make your life easier, it is up to you to utilize these things frugally.In order to truly find enjoyment in the gameplay, you have to really maximize what you can do. If you walk everywhere, you are undoubtedly going to have a dull experience. Of course, for the first episode or two, walking is mandatory, but you soon learn how to create enhancements to make your life easier. While some of these enhancements help you protect yourself, many more of them allow you to be a better courier.Fabricating equipment plays a big part in the game. Before each mission, as well as whenever you visit a hub, you can utilize the resources you have collected and earned to create equipment. The more you deliver for a particular hub, the more resources you will have in that location. Take note that each hub will house its own resources, as the hubs only share information and not items, so make sure to replace any equipment that will soon fail on you.Among the equipment you can fabricate are weapons you can use against your enemies, which you use with similar over-the-shoulder shooter mechanics found in Kojima’s previous works. However, killing enemies has its own devastating consequences, but Death Stranding offers plenty of different ways for you to dispatch enemies without ending them. I may stand alone in saying this, but knowing that there are consequences to killing in a video game is refreshing. Equally so, the consequences are built into the narrative, which you will have to find out for yourself, adding an intriguing combination of struggle and foresight, a handy combination that serves you well on all fronts in this game.The menus themselves are noteworthy. Well-constructed menus work so well in so many circumstances, but the menus in Death Stranding took quite a while to get used to. So much information appears at any one time that visual overload is commonplace. Once I got completely acclimated to the different layers of menus, which finally happened somewhere around the middle of the third episode, my experience streamlined.Personally, one of the coolest aspects to the game is connectivity, which stands as a central theme to the game as a whole. While certainly a big part of the narrative, connectivity is a massive boon to gameplay as well. Everything you build appears in the world for other players (even though you will never see other actual players), and they can use those items if you leave them there. This goes for everything, including lost items, placed ladders, climbing anchors, and more.In fact, one of the coolest experiences I had during my time with Death Stranding occurred the moment I logged in on my third day. Between when I had logged off the night before and logged back on the next evening, an entire road had been crafted, stretching across a massive chunk of the map. With each new crafted item, the game becomes easier, but the amount the world can change when people help each other just blew my damn mind. Connectivity plays a big part in the game, but the different ways the game delivers that theme makes them all feel special.Everything built in the world can be liked by other players. Yes, much like any real-life social media outlet, players issue likes to equipment they find along their paths, and those likes contribute to the creator’s overall growth. The five branches of your star rating allow you to carry more, move faster, withstand more of what the world throws at you, and much, much more. It will feel cheeky at first, but it begins to feel genuine when you give likes to things that actually help you. As players build the world, getting around becomes that much easier for everyone. Players can also upgrade equipment that others have constructed, allowing not only a sense of progress but a sense of contribution, no matter what you do. The more I play, the more I feel motivated to help others either by leveling their structures or creating other things to accentuate what other have created.You find BTs scattered throughout the map, with the first warning sign of them being Timefall. Yes, not only do you have to worry about Timefall ruining your shipments, but you also have to worry about BTs, an otherworldly entity desperate to capture human beings. The naked eye cannot detect BTs, but with the help of your BB’s (your baby) scanner, you can see a shadow of them. The only catch to this scan is that you cannot be moving.Early on, this adds heavy tension. In fact, this pairs well with the first cutscene and the thrilling horror elements it conveys. With BTs being such dangerous creatures, their presence feels incredibly daunting and severe. However, as you continue to play, you find easy ways to avoid them without having to worry too much.In this regard, Death Stranding leaves a lot to be desired. I am almost certainly guilty here of projecting my hopes and dreams for a taste of PT in Death Stranding. For the first couple hours, I had a bit of that fear factor, worrying about every step I took and holding my breath whenever I had to creep next to a BT in order to move on. With continued exposure and increased resources, the fear revolving around BTs becomes a thing of the past.This goes for boss fights as well. At the beginning of each one, I had a unique moment of awe and worry I would fail. By the end of those fights, though, I felt underwhelmed. All boss fights are more time-consuming than challenging; but that’s not the whole story either.As mentioned throughout, connectivity plays a huge part in Death Stranding, and that theme carries into boss fights as well. I don’t want to talk about it too much, just so this part of the game feels unique to you, the reader, but in making the fights feel easier comes this feeling that you are never truly alone. More times than I can count, this feature came in clutch for me, both in the field and during boss fights, and Kojima proves that this point is the most important one he wants to make on all fronts. I’ve never played a game where I stood alone but felt like I still had people to rely on, and I think that, as well as the entire theme of connecting to other people, is far too important in today’s climate to ignore.I’m not quite sure yet about timeless, but Death Stranding certainly makes a case for itself as something special. Daunting menus, rough game pacing, lackadaisical boss battles, and a few heavy handed narrative beats do not keep this title from dazzling in a way that Kojima can do so well. Undoubtedly, the journey to the end is well worth the cost of investment, combining both narrative and gameplay ideas into an oddly cohesive product. All the different ways that Death Stranding makes you feel connected without actually seeing other players offers up a unique experience all its own. In regards to themes and the execution of those themes, I cannot help but recommend that everyone at least try Death Stranding. What it tries to say is well-timed. And do expect a few tears come the end. However, much like the vivid map you travel, be wary of uneven pace.﻿﻿Review code kindly provided by publisherDeath Stranding releases on PS4 November 7, 2019.Death Standing proves itself as a unique, palpable new IP, filled with rich storytelling both in narrative and gameplay. The beginning of the game suffers from long gaps of time intended for learning the ropes, but the ship rights itself once it finally turns the corner. Despite that with a handful of missteps, a deep, potent message of coming together rings through every aspect of Death Stranding that dazzles the game as a whole. If you give it the time, Death Stranding will offer you something most games never do.

Death Stranding,Paul Sullivan,COGconnected,https://cogconnected.com/review/death-stranding-review/,"If you’re an auteur, you define genres. You set trends, push boundaries. Every project challenges expectations. What happens when your life’s work is ripped from you? What do you do when Metal Gear is taken from you? If you’re Kojima-san, you do the only thing you know how. You make something daring. Bold. Risky. You ignore expectations, and make something that changes the rules. You make Death Stranding.Since being revealed in 2016, Death Stranding has undoubtedly been the most mysterious project in gaming. Kojima’s split from Konami was ugly and tight lipped, yet Sony was quick to back the newly formed Kojima Productions. Free from the shackles of Konami and the Metal Gear franchise, the industry was ready for Kojima unchained. Miraculously, Death Stranding is here. No delays, no shenanigans. And after 50+ hours, I might even understand what happened.*This article discusses the world and story of Death Stranding, but great pains were taken to avoid spoilers. However, if you’re sensitive to such things, tread lightly.*Death Stranding is a story about connection. Creating strands between people and places. Coping with loss and building atop the ruins. It’s a big, meaty idea with plenty of dire circumstances, but it’s somehow a much more personal tale than Kojima has told before. Solid Snake was a protagonist with a personal stake in things, but Death Stranding’s narrative has a duality of meaning that’s not often seen in games.If you’re a veteran of Hideo Kojima’s work, you’re already familiar with how Death Stranding is written. Long conversations, big info dumps, and more than enough lore to make everything believable. It’s seemingly needlessly descriptive in places, but weird specificity is part of why Kojima’s stories grab attention. Death Stranding grapples with huge themes like loss and connection, and Sam himself is an allegorical device in service to those themes.Death Stranding is audacious, but not because it goes too far. It’s mature and tactful. It feels personal, even when the world is at stake. As Sam Porter Bridges, your task is to make America whole again. By rebuilding the connections between communities, Sam works to bring together people torn apart by the Death Stranding. What you’ve seen in trailers is actually the game. Sam is a porter, and you’ll spend a lot of time delivering packages.It’s not what I expected. For a few hours, I wasn’t actually sure I was having a good time. Don’t get me wrong, I ended up having a fantastic time. But if you’re looking for MGS6, this isn’t it.The pace is slower and more deliberate, and requires some forethought before setting out. Mapping out routes and examining the map before choosing to leave your climbing anchors behind will save you headaches and extra miles. Along the way, there are often lost cargo containers or building materials to be found using your Odradek scanner, but actually getting them to their destination can be tricky. If you’re the determined sort, you’ll find yourself making a lot of back and forth trips simply to make people happy.As a director, Kojima’s work has evolved right along with his storytelling. His shot selection, framing, and imagery are nothing short of brilliant. His use of angles, focus, and light is truly Hollywood quality, and mostly does away with most of the, uh, less tasteful angles of the past. Except Sam’s butt. You’ll see that a lot. Need a new wallpaper on your computer? Death Stranding is a wallpaper generation engine, and I was constantly hammering the share button to capture it all.This is far from the wackiest thing Kojima has put out, but there are still plenty of grin worthy moments where the fourth wall is broken, or there’s a call back to Metal Gear or gaming more generally.This game is ridiculously pretty. I remember the first few shots they showed of it – I knew there was no way it’d release on PS4. Kojima, for one, but it also looked way too good. The environments are stunning. Many areas look very alien, with bizarre rocky outcrops or unnatural colors, but they feel real. Like I could take an exotic trip and see those exact landscapes. If there’s a game out there with more photorealistic scenery, I can’t name it.The characters are equally impressive across the board. The render of Norman Reedus is as pristine as I’ve seen a model be, both still and in motion. Tiny muscle movements are flawlessly rendered, from minute mouth movements to subtle facial deformation and seamless appearance of wrinkles. If you were playing poker against one of these characters, the rendering would be granular enough to pick up on their tells. Not every conversation is a full cutscene though, and the vast majority are more of the talking head variety. In these interactions, the animation is much less advanced, and even the lip syncing is a little off in places. The quality of the voice acting is excellent though, and it’s miles better than an endless list of cassette tapes to listen to.On the subject of acting, having A list actors on board is revolutionary. Mads Mikkelson is an obvious bright spot, with beautiful delivery that oozes emotion. His work elevates the other, already impressive performances too. Scenes with Mads and other characters are some of the best in the game. If you’ve seen The Walking Dead, you’ll have an idea of Norman Reedus’ performance. Far from phoned in, he puts a ton of feeling into his delivery and I was rooting for Sam right away.All the performances had me feeling the feels along the way, but Tommie Earl Jenkins, Margaret Qualley, and Lea Seydoux are especially good, each of their characters having multiple Oscar clip moments.On the gameplay animation side of things, things are great most of the time. Sam responds to the terrain believably, placing his feet where you’d expect flowing between animations with no perceptible seam. What really impressed me is how differently Sam would behave on different surfaces, or at different angles. If the animation is all canned, there must be a massive number of them. At times though I’d get caught up on a rock that I shouldn’t, or slip down a slope for no real reason, but those situations were rare.Everything runs on Guerilla Games’ Decima engine, locked in at 30fps on PS4 Pro. Things have been substantially massaged to feel a bit more like MGSV, but when Sam creeps through tall grass or has a strange interaction with a rock, the bones of Horizon: Zero Dawn show through a little.Sam is relatively agile, but his ability to maneuver steadily declines as you load up. Balancing is a constant concern, especially early on, and being too ambitious resulted in many suboptimal deliveries. Stack your pack too high, and you’ll be both slower and more unstable, weaving from side to side and liable to tumble. Though frustrating at first, I found managing Sam’s position quite relaxing once I’d picked up on his subtle cues that he was about to tip. Porters are graded and awarded likes based on how well they meet the delivery conditions. Sometimes a package is fragile, or urgent, and exceeding expectations will net more likes. The likes then funnel into buckets and level up Sam’s ability to manage unruly loads or carry additional weight among other things. That all contributes to your public facing Porter Level, which is more a badge of honor than anything.Getting likes from people and communities fuels Death Stranding’s gear system too. Stronger connections encourage folks to share tech with Sam. From more durable footwear to floating cargo carriers, there’s a good variety of gear to utilize. Nothing quite as insane and awesome as the rocket fist from MGSV, but like I said, this isn’t Metal Gear.You’ll notice I haven’t talked about combat yet. The game really isn’t about that, but yes, there is some in Death Stranding. Strewn about the map are MULEs, former porters now obsessed with the concept of delivery, and terrorists, who just want to shoot you. Usually, just avoiding them is best, but Sam is capable of sneaking, stealth takedown-ing, and punch-punch-kicking if needed. It’s serviceable, but I missed the engagement variety of The Phantom Pain. Thankfully, shooting feels pretty good, with enough weight to feel substantial.One of the times you’ll often want to take the avoidance route, is when the BTs show up. Invisible to the naked eye, Sam can use his Bridge Baby (BB) to detect and avoid or engage BTs. Rainfall is a dead giveaway that BTs are nearby, and I tended to slow down anytime it was raining to prepare. Of course, the rain damages your packages, so it’s a risk to go slow too. Yet another example of balancing tradeoffs.Being in the presence of BTs was initially terrifying. I grew more comfortable over time, but they always brought moments of tension to my sessions. If you get caught by BT, the chase is on. They’ll pursue Sam, trying to drag him into the dark abyss. It’s not a game over situation, but let’s just say that it has consequences for both your cargo, and the world at large.Kojima has been long known for unorthodox boss battles, with highlights like Revolver Ocelot in Metal Gear Solid and The End in Snake Eater. Though there are some interesting situat ions, I never felt they reached the heights I wanted them to. Part of that is that the game skews toward easy, and part is that the concept of the game actively leans away from combat. They’re in there, and they’re fun, but they feel like a concession to game design than something that needs to be there.Death Stranding is an online game too, and even though you’ll never see other players, there’s a lot of opportunity for connection. Using your PCC (Kojima still loves acronyms), you can build a bunch of different structures in the world. Things like bridges, postboxes, and other fun stuff I won’t spoil. Once completed, those structures will show up in other players’ worlds. Somehow, it works absolutely seamlessly. Things I built obviously persisted in my world, but things put in place by others were equally consistent.For example, I cut through a mountain pass on one delivery, making it through because of a well placed ladder. On the return trip, the same ladder was in the same spot, placed by the same person. I started to recognize the usernames of others, and developed an honest appreciation for their cleverly positioned structures. That a similar group of names persisted throughout my experience was both surprising and welcome. The server went down a couple of times, and the game simply notified me I was now in offline mode. To my eye, all the structures and usernames in the world stayed put with no fuss; It made me wonder how that functions on the backend. Take note, other devs, because this online implementation is completely seamless.There are things that bug me though. They’re nitpicks, but they’re here. The UI is a lot to handle, there aren’t enough shortcuts for managing cargo, and some functions aren’t terribly well explained, even in the massive codex. Order management should be streamlined too, as you’ll be popping in and out of terminals multiple times to do various things.As something I’ve been dying to understand for 3+ years, I really didn’t know what to expect from Death Stranding. What I found as I journeyed cross country with Sam Porter Bridges is a game unlike anything else I’ve played. Its central mechanic is a monotonous, everyday piece of modern life, and somehow Kojima has managed to make that a very satisfying thing to do. At times that distracted me heavily from the storyline, and I think the midgame would have been more compelling if the story beats popped up more frequently. Still, the quality of the narrative is undeniable. Death Stranding is an outstanding title that ended up blowing away the expectations I wasn’t even aware of. For an auteur like Hideo Kojima, that sounds like an unequivocal success.**Review copy provided by Sony Interactive Entertainment**Developer: Kojima ProductionsPublisher: Sony Interactive Entertainment"
Death Stranding,Liam Croft,Push Square,http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/death_stranding,"GuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpDeath Stranding2019 8.5Game RatingUser Ratings: 155Our Review: Scroll DownI'm not that FragileVersion Reviewed: PS4 Pro / EuropeanWhen Hideo Kojima stated that his next project would bring about an entirely new genre, he wasn't joking. Death Stranding may feel familiar in minor mechanical means, but it's also wholly unique among a sea of AAA titles eager to take advantage of the latest RPG levelling system. It's a social experience where you never see another human player, a narrative-based affair that rivals Metal Gear Solid, and a harsh, thankless undertaking full of otherworldly menaces. Death Stranding is unlike anything else that has come before it, making for one of the very best PlayStation 4 games around.Despite a handful of lengthy trailers and over an hour's worth of in-game footage, Kojima Productions' first title since splitting from Konami still very much remains a mystery. That's on purpose, but gameplay-wise, Death Stranding is exactly what you think it is. Making deliveries is the name of the game, and it's your job to work out a reasonable route to those designated destinations.Split across various sprawling maps, it's an open world similar in vain to Rise of the Tomb Raider. You'll accept numerous orders from Preppers spread across those landmasses and deliver whatever it is their hearts desire. But when it comes to Sam Porter Bridges' role in all of this, it's about the journey which gets you there more than anything else.Equipped with various tools and pieces of equipment that aid you in your travels, you must navigate the harsh terrain of an America in ruins. The desolate landscape can be crossed with the use of ladders to scale cliff edges, climbing anchors which aid you in your way back down, and bridges to circumvent dangerous bodies of water. It's an arsenal of apparatus which may seem a little lacking, but it’s enough to get the job done.The most important factor you'll have to consider as you deliver packages is weight. Sam, played by The Walking Dead star Norman Reedus, can only carry so much on his back so you'll need to work out a method of distributing the burden effectively. Piling it high is always an option, but that means our protagonist will constantly be off-balance as the cargo swings from side to side in the wind. You could attach some items to Sam's suit, which in turn makes him slower as he lugs about more than just his own body mass. Or you could opt to carry a couple of objects with your hands, which takes away a couple of interactive actions away from you. That's thanks to the L2 and R2 buttons having to be held for the entire trek to ensure you don’t drop them.Striking a balance between the three options is key to making a successful delivery, otherwise the load will be damaged the more you drop it. It's a fascinating, incredible set of mechanics that serve as a perfect introduction to Death Stranding. You're made to think about what you will be taking with you as soon as the first order comes through, making for a weight management mini-game that competes with the very best: the inventory sorting of Resident Evil 4.Weight distribution and environmental hurdles are two things you can plan for, but there is a threat you can only anticipate so much. Enemies roam certain parts of the map, scanning for the cargo you're carrying. Referred to as Mules in-game, they're a faction you'll want to avoid confrontation with in the early game. Combat, at least in terms of hand-to-hand action, remains fairly simplistic throughout. Throwing punches and kicks with the square button will down most foes, or you can choose to chuck some of your payload at a Mule to kill them instantly. Without a day and night cycle to speak of, you'll have to stay on your guard at all times as the cover of darkness isn't about to serve up a stealthier means of attacks.There is another type of enemy that is completely immune to the typical damage dealing weapons of Earth, however. BTs are supernatural entities hell-bent on devouring the living, and the only way you can even detect their presence is through the use of a Bridge Baby. Found within Timefall showers, guns and grenades are injected with Sam's blood in order to take them down. You can instead choose to sneak around them by holding your breath, but it's risky business when coming into contact with one kick-starts a boss fight that wouldn't look out of place in Bloodborne.There's a harsh, unforgiving world out there to explore which makes planning the routes you'll take and the equipment that'll be on your back all the more important. Should you risk a shorter, more treacherous journey through the mountains or play it safe across flat terrain but almost assuredly encounter Mule encampments? These are the sorts of questions Death Stranding needs you to answer.Although, there is some help to take advantage of along the way. What makes Hideo Kojima's latest project stand apart from quite literally anything else is its social features. You will never encounter another human player out in the open world, but you will see their contributions to that map. Thanks to an online connection, other users' structures appear in your game, including their bridges, generators, and safe houses. Likes can be awarded to the most useful creations, but it's the way that players can come together which really changes the experience.Roads can be built along certain pathways, mitigating the struggles you'll have in the early game of trying to steer a vehicle through uneven terrain. They require a lot of resources to build, but other players can contribute their own materials to your creation in order to get that highway up and running much faster. We laid the foundations for a street ourselves a few hours into the game and returned to the area a handful of days later to find that a road stretching half the length of the map had been constructed during our absence. It's an incredibly impressive feature that turns the title into something that doesn’t even need your input in order to change its ways.Death Stranding is packed full of systems and mechanics to master, but its biggest flaw is that you'll have wrapped your head around them much earlier than the game expects you to. Making deliveries is a satisfying joy for the first ten or so hours, but when you consider that the title is more than triple that in length, it makes for a rather middling set of chapters in the centre. The delivery you make in chapter seven feels exactly the same as the one you completed five missions ago. This, in turn, makes the complete lack of a major change in gameplay that many had been hoping for all the more heartbreaking. It's justified narratively, but we can't deny the slight sense of tedium we felt halfway through.That lacklustre feeling is only going to be around for a few hours though because boy does Death Stranding pick things up as you head towards its latter chapters. Gameplay becomes much more action-focused as the elements that fans of Hideo Kojima are here to see kick into overdrive. Supremely special settings and locations linger in the mind, outstanding boss fights that harken back to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots create unforgettable moments, and that Kojima-brand of humour and charm seeps its way into every cutscene. Let it be known that the game's last couple of chapters contain some of the very best sequences and moments of the generation.That's something you need to discover on your own, but Death Stranding's narrative really is quite extraordinary. It's Sam Porter Bridges' job to re-connect the United Cities of America by making his way from the east coast to the west and signing Preppers up to the cause. In doing so, he'll bring the Chiral Network back online and take a major step forward to forming some sort of society and governmental backbone all over again.That is, of course, just the tip of the iceberg. Told through beautifully shot cutscenes and in-game chatter, it's the type of plot that could only come from the mind of Hideo Kojima. Exceptional performances from Jessi Corti, Mads Mikkelsen, and Léa Seydoux in particular carry the story through its various twists and turns to an emotional conclusion that goes beyond bringing together a single country. It stands toe to toe with the very best, and if the weird and unusual brand of Hideo Kojima’s storytelling takes your fancy, then you're in for yet another wild ride.What's more, Death Stranding is the best-looking video game currently available on PS4. From its lifelike character models through to the jaw-dropping beauty of each and every landscape, there's something stunning to be found around every corner. Environments can seamlessly transition from a snowy mountaintop to the dull greens of a rolling countryside, containing a cascading waterfall to give it life. There's a certain allure to be found in its emptiness, complemented further by an uncanny soundtrack that can provide relaxation during downtime and intensity when needs be.Following years of mysterious anticipation, Death Stranding delivers on all fronts. An accomplished, fascinating set of gameplay mechanics allow you to make deliveries the way you want to, while social features let the game live on once you've put the controller down. It may become slightly tiresome as you hit the halfway mark, but the phenomenal narrative is on hand to pick things back up again and its outstanding visuals are the cherry on top. Death Stranding doesn’t raise the bar for any particular genre, it creates an entirely new one.Outstanding 10/10Scoring PolicyReview copy provided by Sony Interactive EntertainmentPlease note that some external links on this page are affiliate links, which means if you click them and make a purchase we may receive a small percentage of the sale.

I have a couple of questions. One, is there an equivalent of the codec from MGS? Two, are there unlockables, maybe from competing the game, like MGS has had in the past, like different camo in 3 or the infinite ammo bandana? Not those things specifically, just things that change up the gameplay?So you just wander about delivering packagesOkay.Guess I'm preordering it.Wow, a 10. Nice review. Can't wait to experience it for myself.I'm getting it, but it'll be interesting to see what the range is for this game.@Matroska There is sort of a codec replacement, but it’s a one-way thing. Characters can contact and talk to you, but Sam never actually speaks during them.I haven’t come across any unlockables.So after watching (most of) that 2 hour video and reading this and a few other reviews I can safely say this game isn't for me, that wandering around delivering packages just didn't interest me at all. If you enjoy it great, I may pick it up cheap one day but for now back to The Outer Worlds for meWow awesome review. I set my alarm to wake me for the review, I'm glad I did.I was already excited for this, now I can hardly wait.Looking at the Metacritic review scores (83), it looks like it’s a pretty divisive game. Several flawless reviews dragged down by a few averages and god awfuls.I think I’ll let the dust settle to see how it really pans out.So... I guess I should wrap up Yakuza Kiwami 2 fast, then.Great spoiler free review!I haven't read the review, because I want to go in completely blind, I've waited too long, dammit.but a 10/10 is indeed heralding a revolution.Thanks. My hype cannot be contained anymore.6.8 on IGN, yikes!@MrGawain That's the problem with Metacritic, it lets weird outliers drag scores down. And those outliers might have very different tastes than you. The lowest score DS has (35) is from a guy that gave Ghost Recon Breakpoint a 70/100.This is the game he thinks is a 70.https://youtu.be/kqlKvcRYZoY?t=135Jim Sterling's review of Breakpoint was him on the edge of a nervous breakdown, drunk because he said he could only bring himself to talk about it while drunk.@LiamCroft great review!! Really interested in the concept of building something early, sounds like a sherpa setting up the climb for the Himalayas (without the real danger and minimum wage)! Are the structures you contribute to permanent? Is the game world changed forever when you build?@R1spam Thanks! Yes, the structures you build are permanent.Fetch QuestA Hideo Kojima GamePass until it hits 10 bucks in a couple of yearsI've just asked for next Friday off. With the wife meeting up with her old colleagues for dinner after her work i'll have a whole day to dive in to this game!The review doesn't really sound like a 10/10 for me. Hours in the middle where it's not much fun, and gameplay which seems to be reliant on others who've played before.Would it be a mistake to wait with this? If you pick the game up a few months after release, would you find that there were safehouses every two minutes and safe routes everywhere?I also take exception with the hyperbolic description of Res 4's inventory juggling. Maybe Liam thinks this was a highlight of that game, but it wasn't a huge draw personally. That and the mechanics of DS themselves don't sound much fun at all.Don't get me wrong, it looks phenomenal and plot wise I'm definitely interested, but the lack of combat and the seemingly repetitive gameplay is really putting me off this.Think I'm gonna hold off on this one.@LiamCroft Do you know how the social features will change the game long term? If I pick the game up in 6 months, is traffic on the 12 lane road built through the middle of the map going to be more dangerous than the BTs?This review doesn't read like a 10/10 I've got to be honest. I think it is was we all thought it would be, not a game for everyone!I'm still very much interested in playing it but I don't think I'll be buying it next week, might wait for reviews of Fallen Order and buy either that or Death Stranding this month.It sounds like an indie game with a AAA budget. Not for me, sorry Koj.@Thrillho I have no idea, because I can’t see six months into the future. But pre-launch, I was seeing quite a lot of player-made structures in my game. I don’t know if there’s a certain cap on how much crops up.@ApostateMage What makes you say that? Explain without spoilers if you can.@Matroska to be fair there are quite a few 7's out there too but that 35 is clearly nonsense, especially if he's given Ghost Recon a 70/100 as that game is dreadfulI make hundreds of deliveries everyday in real life and get paid for it. Do I really want to get home and make more deliveries in game?Read the review and I still have no idea how I feel about it. Less weird then it was making itself out to be though I think.Thought it might've been a nine too (Not that I particularly care about scores in the slightest) before getting to the end with the thoughts about the middle being not up to snuff.Think I'll wait a bit before purchasing Postman Pat Sam but it's definitely something I'll get my hands on sooner hopefully rather then later.Nice read as well! @Johnnycide Combat does not make a game better than another. There are plenty of things to do in a game besides combat and every game is repetitive. Just sayin. People ask for originality and something different then complain when they get it.@LiamCroftThanks for the awesome spoiler-free review. Was not planning on getting this game till next year but i might change my decision now.Just one question though, when did you start playing the game and when did you beat it? Just want to guage how long it will take me to beat it with a full time job as i mostly game on weekends.@Netret0120 It took me 35 hours to beat, spread across 12 days of play. However, that includes 4 days where I couldn’t play due to travel. So give or take 8 days overall.I didn't expect such a great appreciation from PushSquare (edit : it's not about the score, I always think that's BS). Made me more interested even if it's annoying not to really know what to expect ...@LiamCroftExcellent. I should be able to beat it within a month then.Oddly enough, i read the review and am excited for a game i still don't know too much about lol. You did say its basically a new genre and i loved the MGS Series so thanks for convincing me to get this game.A brilliant spoiler-free review. I’m hyped beyond all belief and the weird outlier scores from publications that consistently give Call of Duty great reviews is all the more encouraging."" Stevivor Review - 35/100 ""Death Stranding is an irredeemable piece of garbage.There is always one review website in it for the clicks.@LiamCroft do you know how it runs on a normal PS4?@Chippie same i deliver dangerous goods and yet i can't wait!Awesome. Consider me hyped!Seems 2 draggy for the limited time I have 2 play games. IGN's video review shows how long fast travel takes. I totally get the mediocre score.Sounds like a 70 hour movie with fetch quests and inventory micro-management. Just read a few other reviews, honestly for me it just sounds rather tedious on the whole, I don’t have time for that.The most anticipated 10 in Pushsquare history.... Saw that coming since game reveal.It does not read like a 10 anyway to me. So it is actually a delivery man game with a pretty repetitive gameplay, especially in the first half.Guess I will wait till sales/secon hands copies hit the stores...@GodGamer A game where you have to sort and manage your delivery before trekking across various levels from A - B. I'm sure there'll be a typically excellent story behind all of it but the actual gameplay to get there sounds rather tedious for my tastes.@QualityGeezer I’ve only played the game on a PS4 Pro, but I haven’t seen any other reviews mentioning technical problems. I’m sure it’ll run fine on the standard model.Interesting read. It's probably excellent at what it does, but I don't think I'd be too fond of it. The delivery missions sound like they'll get too repetitive. Plus I've never been keen on planning and strategy in games (prefer just to rush in to the action), so planning what route to take and what to carry could be a drag for me.@Chippie I'm sure your deliveries are just as exciting, so no. This game isn't for you.@ApostateMage Journey sounded tedious to me until I played it. If I were you, I'd rent it at some point or wait a few years till it's dirt cheap.I can’t wait to pick up my collectors edition next week I’m so hyped. I do find it funny though that a game that as a 85 opencritic score where 81 percent of critics recommend it has certain “gamers” trying to say it’s divisive lol like in what world is that divisive.Tbh I don't see how from your review that this games score is a 10 when one of the pros of the game is weight management? Nothing on the review makes the game sound fun or that you even play a game it seems all you do is manage weight and then plot a course. If this game was made by anyone but Kojima it would of been slated and forgotten about in a week, but because its Kojima and all the hype and faith people have invested since the reveal I think people are wanting it to be a 10 rather than it actually being a 10. Just my opinion.@supergurr I mean, as the only person here who has actually played the game, I do believe it is a 10/10. I don’t need to “want” it to be a 10 when I’ve played it through to completion.Did you get the same game to review as IGN?This sounds like ""Fetch Quest : The Game"" which I do believe is the most hated style of quest in the gaming community 😂
My interest was low for this title for a while especially since nothing was given out what the game play was going to be like and now it is confirmed as a delivery boy simulator, I think I will be giving this one a miss.
Each to their own but this does not sound like a 10/10 game.@supergurr I agree with out here. A 10/10 should have no flaws (in my opinion) and this has a con about certain scenes dragging on which I have seen knock points of a review in the past. Plus how is weigh management a Pro? Personally, I prefer games where that is sorted out for me, that is why Fallout 4 with added weigh cap mod is just perfect 🙂I'M SO FREAKING HYPED GUYS PLEASE HOLD ME OR I'LL BE SHAKING TILL THE 8TH.p.s. sorry for caps and this is the ONLY review I'll be reading before playing! I don't even trust any other site!@LiamCroft it's hard to argue with that logic but then again you thought Resident Evil 2 was only an 8, I'm not bitter about it though 😉hmm.. colour me interested. even the 'negative' reviews seem to be marking it down because it's not full of the familiar tropes of AAA games, or it's too 'weird', or too kojima.i just scrolled down to the 'Conclusion' right away, to see if it was good, and oh boy i was not disappointed. i am going into this game blind, so anyone talking about or playing this game on the internet will be ignored, until i have played and finished the game myself.This review just highlights the flaws in assigning a numeric 1-10 score to something like a video game.Well after all the videos, conferences and reviews I still have no idea if this game is for me. I am still no clearer if I will pick it up or not. Will check out some gameplay videos after it has been out a little while to hopefully get some idea.Skill Up on YouTube made a great review (as usual) that helps to better understand the game and the mechanics. Very good listening.Now I am more interested in the game@LiamCroft like others have pointed out from your review the game doesn't sound anything like a 10 out of 10. I have read numerous reviews and the one thing they all have in common is that the game becomes repetitive and boring through middle and later sections. They all also say the same thing about the story that it's a mess and it's all over the place. And to say that a main highlight of the game is inventry micro management and the rest is just delivery missions no matter how beautiful the world the world looks games are based on gameplay and story and from what I can gather those elements are severely lacking.But well done on acting like a child, I have played it so I am right. Kind of proved my point.Thanks for the review. It has my interest piqued even more. I will be getting it eventually and this review has me moving it up a notch. Waiting on Fallen Order’s review since probably can only do one of those right now. It’s not surprising the relative divisiveness that the game has created amongst reviewers. Kojima’s latest game MGSV has a similar mixture of opinions about it. (I for one am a big fan of it)But yeah, I like how people who have never played the game are commenting that the review is wrong 😂. Play the full game through to the end and then you have earned the right to criticize someone’s opinion, people.Normally I read Pushsquares and IGNs review....and often you hit the same things good and bad...but this time im confused...you give it 10/10 and IGN only 6.8 and points out quite a lot of annoying things with the game.... what to believe and think.... hmm @supergurr You have not played the game, otherwise you'd have an entire review yourself.Anyway, with a Metacritic score of 84 and 59 positive reviews at the time of writing, I don't know which ones you're reading.Wait....... people actually listen to IGN reviews lolThe game sounds fascinating, and I can't wait to jump into this crazy thing.@JayDub They carry on with 'that should serve as a warning to publishers who give carte blanche.. ' you see exactly what's wrong with scores and what they think they are for.@GodGamer that's not what I said. What I mean is that if the vast majority is made up of fetch quests, and the main challenge comes from not falling over then that's not a AAA title with original gameplay, it's qwop with cutscenes.@Sentinel-88 Nice fake account created with the IGN score on your profile, what a life you must lead lolIt sounds like it doesn't make a good game, but a fun simulation experience if you are into it. Kind of like how some people like The Sims or Farm Simulator and other can't even understand why.I don't really care about the scores to be honest, I think it looks fascinating and that's from someone that's only ever played one Kojima game before, so I'm anything but a fanboy.The only review I've ever been most eager to read all the way and to finally come down to it's score. Liam, you've brought a tear to my eye, before even playing Death Stranding. MGSV is one of my favorite games of all time and even the negative aspects of repeating missions in Death Stranding, makes me believe this is a MGSV successor!What if this is Kojima's style. What if MGSV was almost finished the way Kojima wanted, as he said it was done, after all. Reading this review, makes me think I'm going to go into the same ultimate experience as I did with Phantom Pain.I can't wait to help others connect along my journey. @JayDub. I know right its been more than 7 years since i stop watching ign review s.anyways a 10 is a hideo kojima masterpiece.word up son@Sentinel-88 Says the dude with stickem finger to all of us lol@LiamCroft The online feature sounds interesting. Do you know if that requires PS+ to get the benefits? I mean, it's not online multiplayer, but at the same time it kind of is. Kind of an odd grey area.Also, if all of that stuff is permanent, I can't help but feel that the later someone buys this game, the easier it will be as the world will be full of highways and camps and shortcuts to get where you need to go.Can the game be paused during cut scenes? I hear they’re long, and as a parent it’s important to be able to pause, so it would be a deal breaker if I can’t.@GamingFan4Lyf I'm afraid I don't know. It's not something that has been completely cleared up yet, unfortunately.@Mathieran Yes, you can pause every single cutscene.I know this site is Sony-friendly but come on guys. You are my number one site these days. Don't push me away with this nonsense.Review doesn’t read like a 10, other places seem to say 7 which is far more like I expected. Have to say I find the 10 disappointing. That means it’s almost perfect. This game is not perfect. Even the biggest Sony homer can see that.I’d expect a 9 from here and know it’s between a 7 and a 8...It seems most agree looking at other scores.Home goal here. Word up son and to your mother not a instant classic unfortunatelyso the more and more i saw of this game the more i was put off by it but then i watched this video from PlayStation Accesshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMr8uWwqYBAisn't it strange that all the official press releases were putting me off but then when someone who has been playing the game breaks it down and explains it all properly instead of in PR speak the view on a game can change, the PR was making it sound like a slog of a game, Rob made it sound like an epic i had to playI've never been more undecided on whether I'd like a game or notupdate on seeing other people's structures just saw this on skill up's review. You only see it if you play online. And if you play online you won't see it the first time through an area until you unlock the way station. Still don't know how messy it will look a month later though. Seems like early players can do some useful stuff and when it your turn its all been done. You will see names of players who built bridges etc and when you play it sounds like ""what is left to do, we don't need another bridge here"".That could be the fatal flaw. You want to build and help other players, but if every stream has a bridge, every cliff has a rope down, every gap has a ladder...well then what is left to do?Wow. This is the only perfect score ive seen. Tedious seems to be a common complaint with the delivers and the cumbersome inventory management.graphics look amazing but gameplay looks a bit dull, i'm a gameplay guy so will give it a miss but i know a lot of PS4 gamers are big on cinematics so this should still do well.@PhantomXIII Why would I trust the opinion of people commenting on sites who have never played the game for a minute over a plethora of reviewers who have actually played the game from start to finish?theres over 70 reviews for the game already up on metacritic and about 60 are positive.@Nyne11Tyme Definitely not perfect scores across the board. I've only paid real attention to this site and TSA but a quick look on Metacritic and..Pushsquares 10/10
Trusted Reviews 10/10
Thesixthaxis 10/10,
Screen Rant 10/10,
Gaming Trend 10/10
EGM 10/10
Gaming Age 10/10To name some of them. So this is definitely not the only place you'll find a 10.@Dange It’s actually got 13 perfect scores so far. Not bad for such a divisive game.Why anyone even bothers with meta is beyond me. Gamerankings.com sit it at an average of 85.97 over 33 reviews so far. Not bad at all in my opinionIt’s got Mads in it!Pre-ordered ages agoAlthough: can you pause the cutscenes?I’m getting on a bit and need to pee regularlyPS. Thanks for the informative reviewTbf that review reads more like an 8 to me.IGN, Gamesradar are mostly generous regarding review scores and if they can go that low, then I'll probably wait for a sale.@3MonthBeef I noticed that too. Fake reviews When you use words like ""lackluster,"" ""tedious,"" and ""heartbreaking"" to describe your feelings about certain gameplay elements, I find it incredibly odd that the game can still be called a masterpiece. I seem to remember games like Days Gone not being given a fair shake after using even less harsh criticism than those listed above.@LegendOfStewart exactly. It’s ridiculous and I think it’s clear they always wanted to hype the game up even if the words don’t match the scoreThis is so fascinating - I had no idea what to think when the game was announced, had no idea what to think when gameplay was shown and now I have no idea what to think after reviews..... LOL@Stocksy @LegendOfStewart No game is perfect guys.10/10 – OutstandingThe pinnacle of a given genre at the time of release, these titles raise the bar in virtually all critical categories. You can be sure that a game awarded this score has the highest quality presentation and expertly honed gameplay, but also breaks boundaries and pushes the industry forward in a meaningful manner.@FullbringIchigo Rob is the best.@LiamCroft a Hideo Kojima hill is worth dying on @LiamCroft How can the gameplay be expertly honed while also tedious and lackluster?@Dange daaaaange! Lol😂. Proof that he is super unique just an acquired taste for some. Im excited to play@LegendOfStewart This is my issue with this review too. The reviewer can give a game what ever score they feel but the text does not match the score hereMetro gamecentral gave it a 7 and they're usually my go to site as they seem to be more in line with my own gaming opinions. They didn't give metro exodus a poxy 6 for example.not really a masterpiece tbhre2 still goty so far@LiamCroft Do you think the game you reviewed will be the same game people will be playing in a year or 2 or 3? I know the MGS games never change after launch, but w/ the social aspect this seems more like No Man's Sky than MGS, and NMS is barely the same game today it was at release. Has Kojima talked about his post game plans or is the game too story driven to change things up a lot? I could imagine changes in 3 months for the ""easy"" crowd, like dropping this requirement entirely - ""That's thanks to the L2 and R2 buttons having to be held for the entire trek to ensure you don’t drop them."" Maybe adding in couch co-op, or a pet pack mule to haul your stuff escort mission style.PS did just do an article about how this game released so fast in only 3 years, maybe it's only 2/3 of the game like FFXV?These scores are really upsetting the Xbox owners on Twitter    I said something positive about the scores and they went mental  I am not sure why because they can play it soon on PC with all their other so called average Xbox Exclusives  Anyway Kojima is a GOD @LiamCroftHi Liam, I was just reading another review on Gamesrader (gave it 3/5). That reviewer says they got to chapter 3 after playing for 30 hours!!!Seems they got lost in sidequests and forgot about the story.How necessary are the side quests? Are they worth doing or just padding really? (I'm speaking as a bit of an Assassins Creed Side quest completionist.)@Futureshark I wouldn't describe them as padding, it's at least where you'll come across some of the celebrity appearances, but they're nowhere near the level of Assassin's Creed Odyssey's side quests. There's not really much story to them.Great review Liam.I'll probably wait on getting the game since I have a few games from October's releases that I plan on playing through.I can wait, but for everyone else getting the game next week, have fun!@LiamCroft Just wanna say, excellent review.I have no opinion on Death Stranding either way; I'm a huge Metal Gear fan, but I can't see myself falling for this game, based on what we've seen and heard thusfar. Your review has convinced me to wait and take a chance when things have settled down (no matter how much the game's world might've been altered by then).Regardless, the reaction towards your review and score from some is pretty shocking, and I'm sorry (but not surprised, alas) to see that. I'm just really glad that you loved the experience as much as you did.@RogerRoger Your comment is appreciated, thank you!@Rick_Deckard There is no Photo Mode currently in the game, but there's a good chance it could be added with a patch after launch. The game is still a week out though so it could even be updated with the mode prior to the official release.review Scores are all over the place. Think I might wait for the hype to die down before I consider this.Sorry everyone... just not for me.Nope!@Lekzie1 Why? Have you played it?It amazes me how people are questioning Liam as a reviewer, just because he pointed out a few flaws yet he enjoyed the game so much that he thought it was worthy of full marks. No game is without flaws, throw out any highly rated game my way and I can tell you the problems they have, but also I will more then likely tell you that they didn't get in the way of my overall enjoyment.
Some of you have been on this site long enough to know that PS's review are more often then not very fair, if you think a game gets a 10 but the review reads like another score then it's probably on you rather then the reviewer.Wow what a generation this has been for PlayStation exclusives@crazykcarter And we aren't finished yet. Also have a like for the Blanka rep. This sounds like everything I hoped it would be!look at all these people who have not played it but have the cheek to have a go at the reviewer what planet are these people from🤦‍♀️ this sounds great will see for me next week thanks for the great review 👍 👍I'm personally gonna wait on it. Still have games I need to finish.As for the review, I get why people are divided on it. ""Tedious"" isn't a word I'd use for 10/10 review, but it is Liam's review, he's played it, and since reviews are essentially opinions, he's entitled to it if he feels that way. He's not putting a gun to your head and telling you to accept it, is he?@LiamCroft Thanks for the review Liam. Sounds like a slow burn towards a fab ending. Looking forward to it.I was afraid that this game would fall flat on its absurdity, but glad that’s not the case. Looking forward to it!@David187 I think the issue is (especially for me) is that the words in the review do not match the 10/10 score. Maybe 8/10 as it reads.Between this review and the recent story trailer, I find myself really looking forward to this experience. Everything points to it being a rewarding undertaking for players.@JayDub I still look at IGN reviews. As well as plenty of other websites.The weird thing about this game is, as great the reviews it's getting, some of them I've read are actually putting me off buying it. I don't think I've read one review that has helped me grasp exactly what the game is and I still can't tell if it will be something I'll enjoy.I just don't know if I want to play full price to find out.Did I just read somewhere that the ending 'cinematic' is over 2 hours long!??!!@Futureshark That is incorrect.No thanks, I'll stick with Metal Gear Survive.Only kidding, great review. This is going on my Christmas list I think. @LiamCroft - are there collectibles of any kind? Just wondering about replayability and the incentives to take different routes if I play through it twice.2 hour cut scene at the end geez. So it turns completely into a movie at the end. Can we have a review of the final cut scene then 😉😉. Maybe on Rotten tomatoes then.
EDIT.
Whoops my bad so it's not 2 hours long then. 😊This is one of the only trusted sites that gave Death Stranding a really good review. IGN gave it a 68 and Game Informer a 70. Both cited the gameplay as boring/tedious, which is exactly what it looks like. Eurogamer called it a ""vanity project"". I'm glad Kojima is getting called out a little bit; I appreciate he has a unique vision, but his games just aren't fun imo.I'll say this as someone who enjoys Hideo's previous work:The one thing I take from looking at multiple reviews is that the game is largely boring, repetitive and I question if it weren't Hideo Kojima's baby then it wouldnt be getting the scores that it gets.So many of the 10/10 reviews say that this game is not for everyone and is going to be a decisive game yet it seems to have universal acclaim other than IGN's review. How does that work? Im more confused reading these reviews and watching the scores come in.How on earth can a 10/10 game be boring in spades, repetitive and have a story that apparently doesn't make a lot of sense to nearly all reviewers? The vibe is that everyone is pretending to love this piece of work simply because its Hideo, pointing out its massive issues but still score it unapologetically. Again im saying this as someone who really enjoys his previous work and his story telling in MGS I actually enjoyed.Will keep my pre-order but im sadly going in to this expecting it to be pretentious tosh. Hopefully im wrong but the reviews and corresponding scores dont add up.@Futureshark The ending cinematic for Metal Gear Solid 4 was 2 hours long as I recall. Might have been confused with that?Great review, Liam. You've definitely got me interested in playing this one, sounds like an experience.@solocapers Because the gameplay is ""boring"" doesn't mean it isn't compelling. Why do you think games like Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing and Euro Truck Simulator exist? Because there's a market out there for games that are about completing mundane tasks. DS just happens to have it's hiking and delivery gameplay in a strange world.It comes back this outdated idea that games ""have to be fun"" which hugely limits the medium's appeal if developers had to stick to that outlook.People get upset about a 10/10 review rating for some odd reason. Hmmm, there are plenty of 10/10 games out there that I don't like or don't fit my style, so why would that make the game any less good? A 10/10 rating doesn't mean everyone will like it; it means the reviewer ( @LiamCroft excellent review, written well ) finds the game exceptional.I mean, I'd be a terrible reviewer since I don't finish enough games @AdamNovice Id personally say thats a terrible comparison you are using there.Having played tonnes of Euro Truck Simulator 2 and its expansions I dont think that ETS can ever be called boring if you actually enjoy the game. Relaxing, sure.. Boring ... no.While the premise to driving a truck on motorways can clearly appear boring and put people off who find no interest in that task.. its relaxing and not at all a boring game. Its a paradox to say something is boring and enjoyable at the same time. The very definition of boring is ""not interesting"" and ""tedious"".Reviewers over the industry are outright calling the game boring in spades but are still reviewing it extremely highly which makes no sense.@starhops I wouldnt say people are getting upset about a 10/10 review.. its more struggling to understand why irrespective of the clear highlighted issues marked out in not only this review but nearly all major reviews that the end rating seems to gloss over and ignore the previous however many hundred words criticising large portions of the game.Its not making sense for some, myself included.Its very reminiscent of the music press fawning over Arctic Monkeys' last album: Tranquillity Base Hotel and Casino. Which now the dust settled will be remembered of as a boring, over indulgent, experimental album.The text of the vast majority of reviews of Death Stranding seem to suggest the same, ignoring the scores.@solocapers But isn't the whole ""gameplay is boring"" or ""relaxing"" rather subjective to begin with?I think also a lot of reviewers that say it's repetitive but still give high scores because they know how the text comes across but aren't able to convey that DS is worth your time.Youtubers YongYea and SkillUp actually do a great job of actually showing what their talking about  (a limitation that written reviews have granted) I know some will feel like all you do is pick up gear and walk but you really have to think about where your walking and how you move your character.At the end of the day it's a AAA game that goes against convention so it's bound to have push back from people because they have become so used to run and gun, sandbox 101 with lite RPG mechanics.Many want original new IPs but also seem to want the same things as well.I cannot wait for this game. Already have the PS4 bundle paid off and space in the entertainment center made!@AdamNovice I wouldn't say something is boring and relaxing in the same sentence regardless of it being a subjective thing is the point I was getting at.For example, you cant on one hand say a game is boring yet a masterpiece within the same review. Thats not strictly aimed at this review, although boring is mentioned I believe but seems to be the concencus overall. Its clearly a bit of a paradox which by playing it myself ill figure it out hopefully.Ultimately games are meant to be atleast one of the following imo: fun, relaxing, exciting, thought provoking, rewarding and provide challenge.If a game is barely any of those but is simply different and trying new ideas doesn't mean that its a thing to behold. Its simply a failed concept but with excellent art direction and tech running it.Again, I await my pre order.. hopefully I can see past the reviews saying what seems to me that its a beautiful yet tediusly boring walking and inventory management sim.@LiamCroft sucks u had to be the one to review this game. I knew whwn i saw the score people would be coming at u, smh. I wish people would realize that this is a opinion, people's opinions differ. I would not like being a game reviewer, i think it would make me dislike video games, especially with how toxic responses have become. Just use reviews as a way to decide if u want to buy a game or not, if it would of just said 10/10 with no context that would be different, but obviously u really liked the game. Not everyone has the same tastes. Sorry to sound so salty but people are just rude.Thanks for the review. Wasn't sold on the game having seen the gameplay footages and having read a few reviews, I'm more interested in the story than the gameplay. I think I'll maybe get it later down the line when it's cheaper.@AstralSoul13 It's clearly a game that you need to experience yourself to get what's special about it. You may still not like it, but that's the only way. With most video games, a few gameplay videos are enough. It's clearly not the cas here.A masterpiece? Of course it is, fanboy.@OneMoreLevel Sounds like your a bit salty that it didn't get a much lower score.@AdamNovice No, I'm salty that it didn't get more better scores. Meaning, many reviewers actually told the truth and I'm disappointed of this game already. Overmarketed, famous actors to rise up the fake hype, just something to get Kojima started his own company i.e. getting money.@1_W1NG3D_4NG3L Accept fetch quests in other games are just filler, that's why people don't like them. This is different cos the game is designed mechanically around it.This could have got a 3/10, I would have still got it day one.Looks like a special “experience” to me, either that, or it’s a glossy version of “UPS simulator”, but I want to make my own mind up thanks.This really looks like quite the experience, and a 10/10 is wow - this must be something else. However, I bought Uncharted 4 after reviews stated it was 'maybe too long'. I find it dreadfully long indeed... so these middle missions may stop me from playing. I'm having doubts... Is it bad I don’t want to go to my friends wedding November 8th because I just want to play this game all weekend???Death Stranding has 74 rated reviews currently on Metacritic. Of those, 62 are ""positive"". Of those, 14 are 100%, 2 are 98%, 1 is 97%, 6 are 95%, and 21 rank it 90-94. So of the 74 rated reviews, 44 are 90-100%.Meanwhile...https://youtu.be/f02GKR7SahQIm waiting till there is no more room for any more bridges and all plots are filled so new stuff all gets built on top of other stuff and the game becomes a social exercise in growing the size of the world instead of a fetchquester. Otherwise no thanx.I won't be picking this game up, I don't like fetch quests, no matter how good the story is.Trying to make sense of the 10/10 and 'boring' gameplay too. Am wondering whether, like Twin Peaks The Return, the overall impact, and standout moments of the game, can balance out the 'boredom' or very slow element of some aspects; or, to be more precise, perhaps the standout moments become more significant and meaningful 'because' of the more quotidian moments. Or is it that the 'tedium' itself becomes more meaningful because of the wider context of the story and other moments in the game. The reviews have encouraged me to pre-order, so that's what I've done now... Perhaps this is the perfect hill walking simulator? The act of walking up a hill is, mostly, boring. But the elation of reaching the top, and knowing you did it through your perseverance and skill, is second to none...A highway connecting al the way across already and it hasn't even been released yet? So by the time I play the country will be laden with ladders etc all over, which will make my tasks super easy and I will never require the use of my tools. I don't like that factor of removing some challenge.I would prefer to hit a mountain and think for myself how to get up there, not just see ladders everywhere to use already.Hope there's a way to just play solo without the connected world.@LiamCroft How much swearing, particularly the F word does it have?Am I the only one who thinks this sounds incredibly boring? And Kojima is a bit emporers new clothes? MGS V was overrated IMO. Games are supposed to be fun, Death Stranding doesn't really sound very fun, it actually sounds more like a chore.alright fine i'll buy it at lunch, jeez.I hope this isn't another RDR2; something we are supposed to love, but is dull and emotionless experience.Cant wait for his next game, Rock Equipment: Flimsy starring main character Flimsy Serpent.@jess3a3 If you think RDR2 was dull and emotionless then you must have played a different game than many other people. Sure, the game is slower-paced than most of Rockstar's previous games, but that doesn't make it boring. The game is a masterclass in storytelling (this extends into being emotional), writing, voice acting, and environmental storytelling. That doesn't mean the game doesn't have flaws — it certainly does, just like every game, but it succeeds in so many facets that many games can't even get close to achieving.After 6+ hours i'm returning this game back to Gamestop. The gameplay is to damn mundane for me to continue this supposedly 40 to 50+ hour journey, no thanks..@Nerdfather1 Thanks for saying that!RDR2 is a masterpiece, not without its flaws, but a masterpiece nonetheless. And to say it's unemotional?!Hahahaha, wow just wow.On DS I still haven't made up my mind, I will definitely give it a whirl at some point but if I'm looking for a new game to start this side of Christmas I am leaning more towards Fallen Order. It doesn't help that I'm currently playing a massive game in AC Odyssey and juggling two such games at the same time isn't something I like to do.Congrats to Kojima on branching out and making a game he's always wanted to do, but it's not for me as it looks boring after so long. But I'm glad it's done really good reviews wise and people are enjoying it.@Bartig I read those same reviews for Uncharted 4 I didn't buy it in the end because I felt bored do the series, U2 was probably my fave of the franchise but U3 was tedious long in places but fantastic in some.@BarefootBowser Very disappointed@BarefootBowser Also thought lost legacy was better than uncharted 4 & felt like an actual uncharted game. The pacing was way better than 4, Druckman tried to last of us uncharted 4 smh..@BarefootBowser I agree, The gunplay also irritates the hell out of me. Somehow it was more manageable in lost legacy, maybe because so many damn enemies wasn't on the screen...To all still interested , Metacritic USER scores is 64% ... lots of zeros from gamers who bought this “game” ... This game is not a 10/10 , not by a long shot .. Boring is what 75% of people are saying .. I was going to buy Death Stranding but not anymore ... 10/10 means it’s perfect , right ?Like if you get 10 on 10 on a math exam , it’s a perfect score .. this game is a 50 hour BORING ( gameplay ) game , so how can it be a 10/10 game ?? Pure Fanboy review here ..It reminds me of NieR. Quite strongly in fact. Still early, but the first encounter with the BTs was memorable.@Johnnycide Thats not true though which is why people should play before they speal. I am about 20 hours in and loving it. Its amazing. Ironically The Witcher 3 was a bunch of fetch quests. The game has a unique concept that you can only grasp by playing it. You don't fetch anything actually. If you really want to know how it is then play it.@ApostateMage You couldn't be more wrong. This is why people should play games instead of talking about them. You don't have to sort anythong. You have a load out to choose what tools you want to take and your cargo can be automatically stored on the character. Nothing tedious about it at all. This is not Deus Ex or Resident Evil where you have to manage your inventory. Funny no one complained about those games. After 10 hours of playing its amazing and it just sucks me in.Alot of people are way off on this game. Those who have not played it don't know how off they are lol. I see why PSU gave it a 10. The game is magical. If course it will not appeal to everyone.This is a visionary work like Ico, Shadow of the Colossus or Blade Runner. This is what gaming is supposed to be and what gaming needs.I am sick of people crying about the lack of creativity or risks from AAA companies and wheb they finally get one and an amazing game to boot they cry about it not being what they are used to.Simply put, Death Stranding is the game we need but don't deserve. Its like playing a game for the first time again. Hell your feet can bleed because your shoes degrade.Physics are actually being used to make the world chalkenging. Its like 4D, which is the only way I can describe it. People won't appreciate it til later like the style of King's Field when Dark Souls came out.If I where to choose a game to show to someone who does not play video games, I would show them Death Stranding. The guy has a baby strapped to his chest for Pet's sake lol.Death Stranding defines what video games are or should be, an in depth interscrive and immersive experience.This game is what makes video games as a medium special. It looks great, plays great and sounds great to boot with a great concept and interesting characters.In my 30 years of playing video games I can ssy that Death Stranding is one of the best experiences I have had. Its like when I first played Super Mario Bros 3, but much better due to the technology. Well done Sony and Kojima Productions.One last thing. No micros, no loot boxes, no GaaS, no broken games, no forced MP. Just a master class of game design, gameplay, directing, story telling and great performance.Most people are not going to appreciate what this game means to the medium.@GodGamer Hey man, I'm glad that you're enjoying the game. I've been watching streams of Death Stranding on PS Live and I personally think that it looks monotonous, cumbersome and full of Kojima's usual pretentious and often repeated waffle. I will say that the music, atmosphere and graphics/cutscenes look fantastic, though.@ApostateMage Watching and playing it are two completely different things my man, trust me.@GodGamer Spot on man, it took me a little while to get into the game but then it just clicked, can't stop thinking about it now, I love it.@GodGamer so if I see footage of the game, read reviews of it which point out that the gameplay isn't something I'd enjoy, and disagree with a score based on the text of a review not matching the numerical score given, I should play it anyway? Surely reviews are there to inform purchase? In this case it looks like something I wouldn't enjoy, so I won't be spending fifty quid on it. If there was a demo then I'd be happy to try it, but I don't see why I should drop the cash on this right now.I frequently use Push Square's game review to help determine whether to purchase a game at full price or wait several months for a major discount. Not this time. I'm not sure what game the reviewer was playing, but Death Stranding should have been titled Fetch Quest Simulator: Walking Dread. Death Stranding is no better than a 7 out of 10.@FrequentlyFreaky ""To all still interested , Metacritic USER scores is 64% ... lots of zeros from gamers who bought this “game” ... This game is not a 10/10 , not by a long shot ""Yeah because giving a 0 to a perfectly working game is totally sensible.
You really are a fool if you believe that Metacritic user is authentic and not full of trolls and fanboys, and them buying the game? lol Do you actually believe trolls will buy a game they hate? What are you? 12?@LiamCroft You keep skirting the questions I would also like answers to, is this a one and done game, is there any kind of repalyability ? Cheers.@RustyBullet No replayability.@LiamCroft Cool, as I am totally undecided on this I may just wait till it's a bit cheaper and work on my backlog.People please DISCONNECT your ethernet cable from the back of your PS4 then start the game and enjoy this ONE PLAYER game the way it should be played.Ok, so I initially said that this games was a solid 8, but the more I play it, the more I feel that a 6 or a 7, at best, is what it deserves.
This game is boring. Yes, it is a different experience. And it's nice, for a bit.
But at the end, it's a go there and get/give that kinda game.
So every person that says this game is incredible, next time they play a game with too many fetch quests, they should be in paradise..I just bought this on a whim because i had a voucher which needed spending by today.. Faced with the prospect of choosing a new iron, soft furnishings, Christmas decorations, a bottle of port or a new real (not digital) game in a cover i bought this.. Not played a metal gear solid beyond the 1st one on PS and been vaguely interested in this game since discovering push square. Essentially it was a free game so it's all good i guess.. I do enjoy reading the discussions you all have about the games, better than reading news of the world falling apart... 👍@carlos82 Now this is what I call character development!Went from not wanting this game to playing over 80 hours (I believe?)Kojima would be proud of your character Arc.@DonJorginho haha yep 85 hours and one Platinum trophy and all after my misguided comments before even playing itGave the game 4-5 hours. Boring story , endless cutscenes , it's a walking simulator for fedex junkies. The interface was most likely  created by committee or worse. One point for the pretty pictures.

Death Stranding,Randy Kalista,Gaming Nexus,https://www.gamingnexus.com/Article/6016/Death-Stranding/,"""Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds."" - United States Postal Service creedMeet Sam Bridges. Sam Porter Bridges. Mail courier, seeming germaphobe, and backpacker extraordinaire. He’s the kind of guy that only smiles when he’s alone in front of a bathroom mirror, but he’s also okay with wearing an otter hood made for him by a cosplayer. Sam Bridges has range in every way possible. And about that name: the Death Stranding was an apocalypse that basically bombed the planet back into the Dark Ages. Everyone now seems to take on their occupation as their surname. Hence “Porter.” Hence “Bridges.”Death Stranding is a logistics simulator. But instead of building roads and hauling cargo from a SimCity point of view, you get a boots-on-the-ground view of the FedEx-fueled action. A game where you’re continually cherry-picking the path of least resistance across the National Geographic landscape. Where you’re constantly having old adages crop up in the back of your mind: Watch your step! Look before you leap! Mind the gap! It’s a game of visual extremes, where the ground textures belong in Outside Magazine, but your inventory menus are crammed with 2D line drawings of lookalike gear.Kojima is here with a message of hope. That was the most surprising takeaway I had from Death Stranding. It’s not about getting knocked down. It’s about getting back up. It is a nearly impossible task representing this recovery and reconstruction across all of post-apocalyptic America. But he does it with a pie slice of artists and engineers, doctors and spiritual leaders. Sam Bridges works to reconnect an isolated and disparate people, one delivery at a time. Sometimes he delivers a precious photograph back to someone. Sometimes it’s fuel for the winter. Sometimes it’s a body bag filled with a loved one.Death Stranding goes some places.Everywhere Sam Bridges goes, he’s treated like a bonafide hero. Which makes it all the more startling when you find someone who isn’t impressed with him or the logistics company he works for. But Sam Bridges is a hero in our age where seemingly the only heroes are anti-heroes. The more antihero they are, the more awards they rack up in movies and television.It’s a weird world out there for Sam Bridges. Invisible creatures leave oily handprints on the ground. Walking Dead actors stroll naked along the beach and shed tears over unborn babies kept alive in embryo jars. The only currency is Likes from social media. It’s a game that has you decide between going to the bathroom while standing or sitting, with the resulting bodily waste turned into anti-ghost grenades. You think I’m kidding.Kojima seems to be having a blast making this game. But there are tough topics, too. Motherhood. Surrogate fatherhood. Terrorism. Environmentalism. Cremating a parent. Aborting a baby. Japan’s continuous conversation about being nuked in World War 2. All of it being dealt with by a man that’s expected to reconnect hearts and minds across America, but has a phobia of physically shaking another person’s hand. Thankfully, while Death Stranding is never afraid of giving the player a wink and a nod, its hardest subjects are handled with a deep understanding and a level of maturity I wasn’t entirely expecting.You know how some games, if they’re good, give you one of those “musical moments”? One where the very expensive licensed music kicks in during a contemplative moment in the protagonist’s journey, solidifying the gravity of the situation at hand? Well, Death Stranding feels like it has one of those musical moments every hour—across the span of a game that, for me, inched up to the 100-hour mark. Death Stranding’s pop music sensibilities never get old. Ridiculously pretty music is your most faithful travel companion across a broken United Cities of America (not a typo).The musical connections don’t just crop up in the soundtrack. Your communicator chimes the first few notes to Rock-A-Bye Baby when somebody rings you up. You know, “rock-a-bye baby on the treetop?” Another device chimes “London Bridge is falling down.” You know you’re in Kojima Land when children’s lullabies and nursery rhymes begin to inform the nature of gameplay. It’s wild.Kojima relinquishes directorial control for long swatches of time, but is more than willing to take you through five of the 12 steps in a Hero’s Journey before you even hit chapter 2.Death Stranding is a third-person logistics simulator, if I were to be reductive, but the biggest rewards are waiting for explorer-type gamers. This is the first game since Skyrim where exploration is king. You’re making deliveries, a post-apocalyptic postman, carving a beeline from A to B, drawing out and running down your science-fantasy UPS delivery route, all across a stunning array of geographical biomes and topographical extremes. Instead of ammo you’ve got cargo. Instead of ghillie suits you’ve got suitcases. Instead of jumping out of dropships you’re filling up dropboxes.Well, you’re actually armed and armored later on. Stuff gets real out there for Sam Bridges. But by the time they hand you a gun, it’s startling. It’s a frightening revelation that you’d be capable of killing someone else. Death Stranding is a logistics simulator, yes. But stealth—or just running for your life—is entirely called for in dangerous encounters. And who knows? You might just make it through this thing without taking a single life.The entire cast of characters have names that are so bad they’re good. Like they’re Mega Man bosses. Death Stranding has Deadman, Heartman, and Die-Hardman, for heaven’s sake. Mama and Fragile make up the leading ladies of the cast, which continues to bring up questions regarding Kojima’s relationship with the women in his life. The weirdest part is that it all starts to make sense. Those early trailers with all the crying, the babies in the sand, and beached whales? Those, too, all start to make sense. There’s a ton of Kojima Logic at work, but it’s smart stuff. It’s not that Metal Gear Solid 5 brand of nonsense where “she wears a bikini top because she breathes through her skin” stuff. Death Stranding is frighteningly brilliant in explaining itself—even if we’re still talking about a video game in a built-from-scratch science-fiction universe.While this is a single-player game, there’s limited multiplayer interactions. You can post warning signs or build small logistics structures all across the map, and your signs and structures can appear in other people’s games. Just like their signs and structures can appear in yours. It’s great. If I had to build every dropbox, ladder bridge, and safehouse from one end of the map to the other, I’d be exhausted.Knowing the mountain climbing gear I built is getting Likes from other players, or me giving Likes to the people that cooperatively (in their single-player games) built an actual bridge across a deep, rushing river? That’s where Death Stranding gets meta in its message of connecting people. Sam Bridges is bringing people in the UCA closer together—while you, the player, are brought closer to other players through your building projects. Heck, it’s worth handing out a Like when you come across a cheerleading “You can do it!” sign at the top of a particularly nasty hill climb. It cost nothing for that player to post that sign, and it cost you nothing to hit the Like button. Yet it works out great for both players.I’ve never looked worse in a video game than when I’ve been caught by the ghosts. I was dragged a hundred yards through the black oil at ground level. It was an inky black squid that caught me that first time. Left me looking like I’d taken a bath with a bunch of Bic pens. And it left a massive, impassable crater on the map. It was devastating. I was devastated. This much terrain deformation is unheard of.Kojima declared that he’s created a new genre: the stranding genre. It often takes a lot of retrospection to know when and where a new genre is created. It takes years. We only started labeling some games as “roguelikes” in the last few years, but we label them after a game from 1980. I’m 100 percent skeptical that many (if any) game developers can follow in Kojima’s steps in Death Stranding. I’ll grant that he’s breaking plenty of molds. There’s no arguing that. But whether or not a proliferation of “stranding genre” video games hit the market is doubtable. And that’s no criticism. Kojima has singularly struck out on his own. He’s nothing short of a trailblazer.A trailblazer that sends mixed messages about masculinity and male sexuality. It’s a game where you can stare at Norman Reedus’s butt every time he takes a shower. Yet, if you try to zoom the camera into his crotch while he’s fully clothed, he’ll eventually punch the camera. Seriously.Really, my only complaints center around a very few quality of life issues. The cargo menus, for example, desperately need to be sorted by destination. Or by cargo type. Having to flip through a hundred individual entries just to find one or two packages going to, for instance, the Wind Farm? That’s too much squinting and scrolling. And when taking on deliveries, I’m feeling like I have to confirm things one too many times, or I’m being railroaded out of the menus before I’m fully loaded. I eventually picked up what the menus were putting down. I got better and faster at negotiating their quirks. It just felt like there was a two-factor-authorization happening when single button presses would do the job.I don’t know if this is a good or bad thing, but I felt my work ethic strengthen around this game. Like I knew that it was work to play it, but I was enjoying the work. And you know what they say: If you love what you do, you’ll never work a day in your life. That expression has only barely ever made sense to me. Until now.I grew slowly and steadily afraid that all of these Hollywood actors wouldn’t amount to much. I saw the tears streaming down their faces in the trailers, but hadn’t felt any of them had earned mine. Then a particularly moving performance by Margaret Qualley as “Mama” nearly broke me. Wiped away all my skepticism after that.Death Stranding isn’t about an apocalypse. It’s about the reconstruction afterwards. Vince Lombardi, whose name is on the NFL’s Super Bowl trophy, once said, “It’s not whether you get knocked down, it’s whether you get up.” That’s what Death Stranding is about. Getting back up. All the way up from all the way down. It’s an ode to the American Dream, which could only come from a designer outside of America, since—let’s be real—the American Dream has been oversalted in nothing but irony ever since Rockstar started making Grand Theft Auto.I began to get something of a Tetris Effect when I wasn’t playing. I’d see the different textures in the grass, rock, water, and snow, passing before my eyes in a slow cascade downward. It all seemed to be leaving a ghostly image in my mind, since so much of Death Stranding is spent looking down at the ground, with quick glances up to make sure you’re still headed in the right direction. I welcomed the cascade during my working hours.Sam Bridges is drawing a new Oregon Trail across the land. But this time it’s a trail of the friends he made along the way.Hideo Kojima has fully weaponized the walking simulator, writing a love letter to the delivery service workers of our shipping and handling world. Death Stranding is about ending isolation, and does it so gracefully that I can't imagine it being done better than it's done here.* The product in this article was sent to us by the developer/company.Randy gravitates toward anything open world, open ended, and open to interpretation.

Home » Features » Death Stranding’s PC Port Is GloriousEmotional, bleak, and one of the most truly unique games in the AAA space, Death Stranding is as evocative as it is divisive. The PC version is the definitive way to experience Hideo Kojima’s grim opus, but it won’t convert players who bounced off of the original PS4 release.A truly impressive port, Death Stranding on PC looks and performs better than ever, and the increased visual fidelity and a higher frame rate combine to take an already great game to new and dizzying heights. PC players have had to wait seven long months for the release of this version, and I’m happy to report that that patience has been rewarded.Key additions to the PC release include crossover content from both the Portal and Half-Life franchises, which takes the form of new quests that are interesting enough in their own right and also reward players with in-game cosmetic items from that universe. Now you can complete deliveries while wearing a gruesome Headcrab hat so that your dreams can instead always be nightmares forever.Kojima Productions, in partnership with NVIDIA, has included some impressive new tech in the form of DLSS 2.0 (Deep Learning Super Sampling). Exactly how it works is fairly complex, but in layman’s terms, DLSS provides a massive performance boost, while at the same time increasing graphical fidelity, which is fantastic news for anyone gaming on low to mid-tier rigs looking to see this game in its true glory.I was running the game on an RTX 2080 Super, 32GB of RAM, and an Intel Core i9 9900KF, and I had zero issues running the game in 4K at well above 60fps. Admittedly, it is a pretty beefy rig, but I noticed not a single hitch throughout my entire time with the game, even during the most graphically intensive encounters and areas.The visuals in this version of the game are simply stunning, easily on a level with other PC technical powerhouses like Red Dead Redemption 2 or Resident Evil 2. The draw distance is astonishing, stretching off far into the horizon, and the level of detail in character models, both during cutscenes and gameplay, is simply insane.Death Stranding tells the tale of Sam Porter Bridges, a post-apocalyptic courier who delivers both physical goods and literal hope to the survivors of an extinction event known as the Death Stranding, which causes corpses to explode and whales to beach themselves en masse, among other supernatural oddities.While Death Stranding certainly has cinematic aspirations, it is, at its core, a video game. For every hour of cutscenes, there are many more spent trudging through the wilderness, managing stamina bars, and weight distribution, and completing deliveries.The UI through which this is accomplished is unchanged from the console version, which was a little clunky then and remains so now. Managing your inventory with a mouse certainly helps, but I wish more had been done to optimize this aspect of the game for PC players.Gameplay primarily consists of making these deliveries, and everything else that entails. You take on a request, gear yourself for the journey ahead, plot your course, and take the first step. What follows is perhaps the most hardcore literal walking simulator ever created, as you must guide Sam step-by-step through the ruins of an America that is geographically much more reminiscent of Iceland, replete with fjords and volcanic black sand.Every step of the way must be carefully navigated and micromanaged, as losing balance can see Sam tumbling off a ravine or a boulder, scattering his cargo and potentially damaging it in the process.The PC controls are fairly intuitive, and can, of course, be remapped as you see fit if you so choose. For my money, I think this kind of game is better suited to a controller, but your mileage may vary there. I will say that it took some getting accustomed to using the left and right mouse buttons to stabilize Sam’s weight distribution, but I got used to it before too long.There is some third-person combat, but it is really window dressing as Sam isn’t a soldier. There are bandits known as MULEs that control sections of the map, and their inclusion does add a nice level of tension, knowing that some delivery routes may be prone to ambush. There are also the monstrous BTs, otherworldly dead things that plague the planet. You aren’t able to really deal with them until much later in the game, so at least initially, encounters with them feel akin to a horror game in which all you can really do is run to survive.Death Stranding is a game that players are either going to love or loath. You could be totally on board for Kojima’s brand of sometimes overly theatrical storytelling and still bounce off of the gameplay segments, or vice versa, and that makes it difficult to recommend generally.The PC release is the optimal way to experience the game, however, and for players that had the patience to wait, you are in for a treat. Similarly, returning PS4 players looking to double-dip will be able to appreciate the level of technical wizardry Kojima Productions have performed with their PC release.Wherever you play it, Death Stranding is an unforgettable experience, and it isn’t often that a high-profile game is able to take such artistic swings. They don’t always connect, but when they do, they show why the name Kojima holds such reverence in this industry.The PC version of Death Stranding releases July 14.Copyright © 2022 GAMURS Group

Death Stranding,Malindy Hetfeld,PCGamesN,https://www.pcgamesn.com/death-stranding/review-pc,"In a desolate world, be the delivery man to save us all

                    Malindy Hetfeld                

Updated:  Jul 14, 2020 Hideo Kojima’s first post-Metal Gear videogame envisions a world in which people can’t leave their houses because of something deadly, which in 2020 obviously hits closer to home than he could’ve known. But the source of humanity’s demise isn’t a virus or its own hubris, it’s an invisible threat. You can’t fight what you can see, and so instead Death Stranding offers a solution hitherto unseen in big budget videogames – what if you didn’t shoot your enemies but simply walked around them?

It doesn’t sound enticing, and yet it’s an accurate description of Death Stranding, a game that can be achingly boring, but uses that boredom in such a way that even the most mundane problem becomes somehow exciting. You play as Sam Porter-Bridges (Norman Reedus), a, er, porter for a company called Bridges. Sam’s whole job is to deliver cargo on foot. Following an event called Death Stranding, the world of the living becomes connected to the afterlife via intermediary locations called beaches. You know, where things strand. The dead who get lost in the world of the living via beaches are thus called BTs, short for “beached things”. If a living being comes in contact with a BT, the result is a voidout, a massive explosion leaving nothing but a crater behind.


That’s not all – BTs appear during the rain, which isn’t simply rain, but ‘timefall’, rain that rapidly ages anything it comes into contact with. Understandably, this causes people to swiftly move underground, becoming dependent on porters the same way I now depend on the regular delivery of online orders. Sam can go outside because, unlike most people, he can sense BTs and thus find a way to avoid them. As if that wasn’t handy enough, he’s also a repatriate, meaning he can’t die.


Following the Death Stranding, people are doing their best to rebuild some sort of shared society via the UCA – “United Cities of America”. UCA cities exchange information with each other using the chiral network, Death Stranding’s post-apocalyptic internet. On her deathbed, Bridges, the president of the United States (played by Lindsay Wagner) asks Sam to travel to cities all across the USA and restore the network, all the way to the city his sister Amelie (also Wagner, digitally de-aged) is held in by separatists. It’s a very complicated setup for a simple idea – you stack cargo onto Sam’s back, you deliver it, at the point of delivery you pick up some more and walk to the next destination.



The delivery itself is likely the most enthralling thing about Death Stranding. It’s a game packed with pseudo-science and weird political ideas, making it unmistakable as a Kojima game, but it takes the simple act of walking and imbues it with so much detail that the journey itself, as lonely as it is, becomes the focus of the experience. Sam is just one man, with all the physical limitations that entails. If you burden him with too much cargo, he struggles with every step. His walking speed slows, he stumbles over the smallest stone, and if you take a hard turn the weight of his cargo causes him to lose balance. He can climb a few rocks, pushing himself up slowly, panting and grunting all the while, and he can wade through water shallow enough for him to stand in.


Difficult actions like this cost stamina and endurance. Stamina is the strength Sam can use short-term until a river drags him away or until holding his breath becomes too much, while his overall endurance depletes more slowly and is mostly measured by how tough the going gets. He can tread down his shoes until you need new ones. He needs to sleep and take showers to wash the grime off. Every tumble you take feels catastrophic – the last few seconds of desperate balancing before a hard impact, Sam swearing, his cargo taking damage and, most annoying of all, falling all over the place. Every stretch of the journey, across steep mountains and large rifts in the earth, takes patience and strength, and reaching a destination after a hard trek comes with the same sense of relief a real hike does.

Sometimes you cross into BT territory, recognisable by an upside-down rainbow in the sky and particularly harsh timefall. While you eventually acquire weapons to deal with these ghosts, you’re generally encouraged to sneak your way through. To help with that, Sam acquires a BB, or bridge baby. Bridge babies are infants swimming in a tank of amniotic fluid, forever caught between life and the state of being unborn and thus able to sense BTs. The rain, your scanner constantly pinging for BTs, and the restless noises of your BB can make for pleasantly tense sneaking – even though compared to stealth sequences Kojima designed for Metal Gear, these never become really challenging.


Later in the game, you also encounter human enemies, from cargo-obsessed terrorists to the aforementioned separatists led by Higgs (Troy Baker), who you take down with more traditional methods. Firefights in Death Stranding are a disappointment: weapons feel entirely weightless; there’s no discernible difference to hit boxes; and often you’re in wide open space with no cover, which leaves no room for tactics. The occasional boss fight however, is exciting because all of the limitations placed on Sam still apply – he still carries cargo, gets out of breath, and needs to regain his footing. Balancing that with the very real threat of death can be a lot, and the battles are better for it.


Death Stranding doesn’t reinvent the wheel, it just puts a different spin on familiar gameplay elements such as the scanner or the zip line. There’s a book’s worth of tutorials for every piece of equipment, giant menus and controls that require so many buttons to be pressed simultaneously you’d do best to stick with the great mouse and keyboard controls. Both mechanically and narratively, the game sells itself as more complicated than it actually is – a large-scale fetch quest in which items don’t just disappear into the depths of your bottomless pockets. It’s a stimulating reappraisal of mechanics we’ve taken for granted for so long, but it unintentionally reinforces how some things, like fast travel, don’t just exist for convenience sake – they exist because their absence can turn a great game into a tedious one.


Making it to new landscapes serves as a good motivation, as Death Stranding looks fantastic. From snow-capped mountains to hills shrouded in mist, it offers great vistas, even if on ground level these often turn out to be craggy flatland. The core loop of finding a path and walking it is meditative and imbues you with a real sense of achievement all of its own even before you reach your destination. Unfortunately, you often walk the same paths back and forth in short succession, and the narrative justification for repeat trips is often flimsy at best. Had it left out these trips, Death Stranding could have been a good deal shorter. As it is, it even pads the whole experience with a collect-a-thon of additional, non-story-relevant orders.


For most of the game, the narrative takes a backseat to world-building in the form of emails and log entries. As much as Death Stranding hands to you in writing, as little do its characters actually say. Sam is near-silent, and most of the time only asks for more exposition. Conversations are full of pregnant pauses, and a lot of what’s being said simply presupposes information you don’t have. Additionally, some elements are left vague to the point of ridiculousness (“But why?” Sam asks in one scene, only to be told “You know why”).


The characters barely live up to such a description – not least Fragile (Leá Seydoux), the leader of Bridges competitor Fragile Express, who is more of a plot device/deus ex machina where needed. At the same time, Death Stranding somehow manages to make nearly all of its female characters the sole bearers of pain in its story, both physical and mental. If anything bad happens, it happens to a woman, and it happens in order to provide a vehicle to a male character’s actions. Good experiences and tender moments will be cancelled out by more horror down the line, so that the good you’re actually doing is an entirely invisible process. You hardly ever meet the people you make deliveries to, and the UCA is an anonymous mass of Americans you have no connection to. Your efforts are regularly rewarded with the same cheer of positive reinforcement: “Well done, Sam!”, “You’re the best, Sam!”, “We’d all be lost without you, Sam!”


This is especially odd seeing as Death Stranding otherwise makes such an effort to somehow bake all of its conventional gamey-ness into its world-building. Take the multiplayer element and Likes, the game’s currency. On your journey, you often depend on other players – real players and NPCs you never get to see, as you help each other by building bridges and shelters everyone can use. You can press a button to call out for them as you would a person, and they will answer, making things less lonely for a moment. It’s a fascinating idea for a multiplayer element in an otherwise single-player game, it works well and is often sorely needed.



You can give Likes to other players, earn them by building things, and of course get them for deliveries. Likes work as experience points, only that they don’t upgrade your character, but cities and waystations instead, making it possible to gain better equipment there. NPCs will regularly speak of those other porters, and in several scenes award you Likes. It’s all very meta, making connections between other people and using social media currency, but it’s delivered with absolute seriousness.

For all intents and purposes, Death Stranding is often a fairly conventional game behind the veneer of an artistic fever dream. A giant vanity project that fits in cameos by characters from Valve games, but it’s the seriousness with which it delivers even its most ridiculous ideas that makes it work. I wanted to see it all – the next gizmo that would help me on my travels, the next cutscene full of beautiful digital people with flawless skin (and Guillermo del Toro as Bridges resident boffin), the next vaguely creepy vision of the afterlife. Death Stranding can try to sell you merchandise and Monster energy drinks one moment, and ponder about the value of human life the next.


Kojima’s muses and famous friends act out a story so overblown there’s no point in asking after its flimsy politics or trying to fill its plot holes – as always with him, either you’re on board or you’re off. This time, I was firmly on, and it wasn’t for the story, it was for this weird, thrilling, and sometimes deeply boring experience. The mere fact that the game managed to be all these things at once made me respect it, as little as I cared for its story or bland world. In the end, the journey was the destination.        


As thrilling as it is boring, as fantastic as it is mundane, but one thing’s for sure – there’s truly nothing else like it.
