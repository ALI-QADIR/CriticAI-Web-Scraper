Link Official site (opens in new tab)A genuine pleasure over my lifetime in gaming has been watching Monster Hunter go from a niche favourite to wild success in Japan, and gradually making inroads in the west before—with Monster Hunter: World—smashing through and becoming a global hit. That's perhaps over-simplifying the arc for Capcom's beast-bashing grindathon par excellence, but the series now has a huge fanbase and the kind of resource behind it that has resulted in years of better and better games, as well as a distinct split.There's the Monster Hunter: World take on the series, which has the fundamentals but is a seriously big-budget endeavour—a visual and aural spectacle with gorgeous, flowing animations and jaw-dropping monsters. Monster Hunter: Rise is the other branch, following in the footsteps of games like Generations and hewing closer to the series' portable heritage: Smaller, more contained maps rather than larger more open-world style exploration.Rise was, of course, originally designed as a Nintendo Switch exclusive and, though this PC release is a good port with everything you'd expect, it has nowhere near that immediate visual 'wow' factor that World did. Nor can it compete on things like textures or the stunning bespoke animations for monsters fighting each other.Thing is, though, Rise is the better game.Monster Hunter's problem for new players is also the game's main strength: This is a combat system of almost unparalleled depth and precision, with literally dozens of fundamentally different playstyles. It's overwhelming at first. Rise has easily the best onboarding experience in the series, and in the process introduces several new mechanics that enhance the hunting experience even beyond Generations.One of the most fun additions is your Palamute, a rideable dog. You've still got your Palico, of course, but the dog transforms the game's traversal which, arguably, was always a weak—or at least not standout—element. Series veterans will recall many a long slog across maps you know like the back of your hand, simply because that's the way things were, but in Rise your options with and without the dog now include wall running and a Spider-Man-style grapple that doubles up as an essential battle tool. You can not only get around faster than ever, but it feels amazing to do so.This in turn changes up the rhythm of fights but in an awesome way. In older Monster Hunters, there always comes the point in a fight where your quarry realises they're in a spot of bother and takes off. You could very rarely stop them escaping or interrupt these movement sequences, but now, you just instantly hop on the dog and give chase. This may make me sound slightly psychopathic but it is enormously satisfying to chase down a wounded creature trying to escape, and set about it with your mates. Performance was smooth on a GTX 1070—not that you'd expect any different. Rise does suffer from screen tearing on occasion, though I didn't notice any frame drops or other performance issues. There are some basic presets before the graphics settings allow you to turn a wide range of options on or off, as per your preference, as well as support for ultrawide monitors and an uncapped framerate.

The obvious caveat here is that, if you're playing this in 4K on max settings with a mega rig… it's never going to compete at that level. If you can stomach a few jagged edges and fuzzy textures, however, the art style more than makes up for the lack of grunt.There's a quality to Rise that maybe isn't obvious, which is that it has stripped away an enormous amount of the busywork the games used to come with. You used to have to look up what the 'key quests' for each hunter rank were online, for example, whereas now the game just tells you. The upgrade trees for weapons have been made clearer. There's a mini-tutorial or guidance mission for every important element. It punts all the stuff that was a bit annoying.In turn this means you spend most of your time playing Monster Hunter: Rise actually hunting monsters rather than fiddling around in menus or trying to work out what to do next, and hunting is absolutely why I play these games. You can zoom through hunts with almost zero downtime, and combined with the generally faster pace of the game it makes Rise feel so much more pacey and vibrant than the older titles. The sense of verticality it has in the locations and the way you zip around them soon becomes second nature, and it really feels like from the opening seconds the chase is on. Monster Hunter has always been unforgiving: if you take its monsters lightly, even the weediest will quickly dispatch you. Rise follows the usual pattern of setting you off against small dinosaur-like creatures like the Great Baggi or Great Wroggi before introducing the wilder, weirder stuff like Tigrex, the stone-cold classics like Rathalos, and the (mostly) awe-inspiring fights against the Elder Dragons. It's actually difficult to describe a 'typical' hunt in Monster Hunter: Rise because part of the game's inexhaustible quality is that there are so many dozens of large monsters by now it can mix-and-match them in endless new combinations. It's also less shy than ever before about having monsters fight one another, which used to happen rarely in the older games but is now very frequent (you can also temporarily 'ride' the monsters during these and enjoy a Godzilla moment).This may make me sound slightly psychopathic but it is enormously satisfying to chase down a wounded creature trying to escape. The monsters look absolutely amazing, and the older ones have more aggressive and surprising behaviours than ever. This game is a riot: I went with gunlance (again) because I love it, and the weapon has certain familiar moves but also a whole bevvy of new ones that make it feel completely new. The more Rise you play, the more it has to give. You begin unlocking special moves that give each weapon's moveset a new angle of approach, or a ten-tonne slam for when it's needed (Gunlance's big downside was always low mobility, but in Rise this feels irrelevant when you're doggo-sprinting, grappling, and force-blasting across the landscape). Sometimes you try out a new ability, process what has just happened, then mime a chef kiss and give silent thanks to the Capcom brain that thought it up. The sheer variety of Rise's bestiary and weapons means that, even as the game cracks on at enormous pace, it doesn't stop serving up new stuff for a very long time. There's so much to do here, and it's all laid-out and explained better than ever, with all of the little fiddly bits that used to annoy players just gone. Sure, this might be a Nintendo Switch game in origin, and visually it shows. But who cares, because it's hard to shake the feeling that Monster Hunter Rise is as good as this series has ever been. Which is to say: As good as it gets.Monster Hunter: Rise is arguably the greatest entry in Capcom's flagship series, and a game that simply never stops giving.Rich is a games journalist with 15 years' experience, beginning his career on Edge magazine before working for a wide range of outlets, including Ars Technica, Eurogamer, GamesRadar+, Gamespot, the Guardian, IGN, the New Statesman, Polygon, and Vice.

Monster Hunter Rise,Martin Robinson,Eurogamer,https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-03-23-monster-hunter-rise-review-the-switchs-best-game-since-breath-of-the-wild,"Magnanimalos.I've just drifted my dog into battle, his hindlegs tilting out in a glorious arc at the press of a button for that precious extra boost of speed, before dismounting with the flick of a wirebug that sends a silken line up into the sky, allowing me to grapple onto it and swing towards my prey. In mid-air I pull out a sword fashioned from the remains of a bony Besarios and drive it straight down into the skull of another. Bring this big bastard down and I can fashion a hat out of his hide to complete my Besarios outfit and grant myself an attack boost, so that I might be able to go out and do it again only with more flair, and more efficiency. 
 Good gosh do I love Monster Hunter.
 The core loop remains unchanged but Capcom's series has evolved an awful lot since its inception way back in 2004, and after a long run on Nintendo's console that peaked with the exceptional Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate it was only after 2018's multi-platform Monster Hunter World that the series found a proper foothold in the west. Here was Monster Hunter at its most accessible - and, with expansion Iceborne, at its most brutal - and for the first time it no longer felt like a niche pursuit. Monster Hunter had finally gone mainstream.
 Forgive me for making crass assumptions, but I'd presumed the series' return to Nintendo, and to more modest hardware - Monster Hunter Rise is a Switch timed exclusive, with the PC version not arriving until early 2022 - might mean a more modest outing for the series. I could not have been more wrong. This is as lavish and opulent a thing as Monster Hunter's ever seen, Capcom's inhouse RE Engine excelling in its debut for the series while its soundtrack is fully orchestrated and accompanied by full vocals (every single monster gets its own unique introductory song complete with shamisen and hyoshigi in keeping with Rise's traditional Japanese theming). It's as if all that money made through Monster Hunter World's success somehow made it into Rise' production. 
 This is as significant a step forward for Monster Hunter as World was before it, with a generous suite of new features making hunting more palatable, more action packed and much, much more pleasurable. Before running through them all, though, there's one underlying change worth noting that's seismic in nature, and that informs everything that's new this time out. Traditionally in this series, you're the whipping boy - for the first few dozen hours at least - as you get knocked this way and that by all number of beautiful beasts. In Monster Hunter Rise, however, you are OP AF, and I am 100 per cent for it. 
 It's not so much that the monsters here are a pushover, and more that Rise is willing to push you through it all with a bit more pep and pace than seen in previous games - here you'll be going head to head with new signature beast Magnamalo when an earlier entry would still have you ferrying eggs from one end of the map to another. Hunts are quicker, too - even the later enemies unlocked after the credits roll, itself done after some 20 hours, can be felled in just over 10 minutes if you've half an idea what you're doing. Is that a problem for a series where endurance and hard-edged challenge has often been part of the make-up? Maybe for some but most certainly not for me - and anyway, the reason these things go down so much quicker is because you the player are so much more dynamic than ever before, with so much more in your arsenal.The headline addition might be the wirebugs that let you fling from point to point, though they're just one part of a whole cohort of new colleagues that open Monster Hunter's maps like never before. As in Monster Hunter World, maps are now one continuous area rather than the partitioned zones of old, though they're freer and less claustrophobic than the dense biomes found last time out, partly to make room for the all-new Palamutes. These are canine mounts, on hand to hop onto at the press of a button and taking so much of the misery out of tracking. It helps that these things are absolute delights, customisable to an outrageous degree whether that's through you outfitting them with spoils picked up through your adventure or even in the character creator itself (a tool that's as powerful as any I've seen in a game like this, and something that could quite easily consume the first half dozen hours of your time with Monster Hunter Rise should you be that way inclined).Another new feature to be found in Monster Hunter Rise are the Rampage events - though their impact and indeed even their frequency is limited in the extreme in the base game. Essentially it's an evolution of some of the more staged encounters we've seen in previous games, only this time out you're building defences and mounting guns as you face down hordes of enemies that precede one final big bad. It's a neat wrinkle and enjoyable enough the few times they crop up though that scarcity suggests they're not too important a part of Monster Hunter Rise's make-up. Whether that changes in the future as Rise is updated remains to be seen. While riding your Palamute you can consume items or resharpen your weapon, and the act of tracking itself has been greatly streamlined: thanks to your new Cohoot buddy, it's now simply possible to see each monster on the map, a blunt solution that's still more elegant than Monster Hunter World's scoutflies that have now been completely excised. The actual involvement of your Cohoot is limited, admittedly, though it's hard to complain too much: Monster Hunter Rise gives you an owl companion you can dress as you please, and that's plenty good enough for me.For all that, and the returning Palicoes that aid you in battle, it is those wirebugs that really do make all the difference. How profound that will ultimately prove to be it's hard to say- after 50 hours with Rise, I'm only really just beginning to prod at the possibilities - though I will say they're responsible for one of the most engaging, open and elastic traversal systems I've seen in a game outside of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wilds. Seemingly nowhere is out of bounds now, and while they're limited as a resource - you typically have two flings available on a cooldown timer - a short combination of well-timed leaps can have you scaling even Rise's greatest heights. Combine that with Rise's impeccable gyro aiming and you've got a movement system that's simply delicious.It's tempting to dwell on a comparison with Breath of the Wild, but truthfully it's an extension of a path the series first set upon with Monster Hunter 4's emphasis on verticality and mounting. Mounting is something that returns here in Rise, though in keeping with the mentality found elsewhere it's now been supercharged. That same silk wire that can propel you around the map can also entrap prey and allow you to control them, puppet style, to unleash even more damage, giving turf wars an extra edge as you smash two monsters together. It is as gloriously overstated and over-the-top as everything else you'll find in Monster Hunter Rise.That wire silk also lends each of Monster Hunter's staple 14 weapon types a new edge, granting them new moves that eat away at your wirebug resource in exchange for a dazzling volley. Then, of course, there's simply the ability to launch into combos while airborne with that bit more ease, or how the added movement impacts positioning in a scrap. Factor in the aforementioned gyro controls that make ranged weapons more viable for players like myself who've previously been reluctant to experiment and you've got a Monster Hunter that can feel profoundly different to what's gone before. Indeed if there's another offshoot to Monster Hunter Rise's empowering of the player it's how it encourages experimentation, encouraging you to pick up a weapon type you might previously have neglected, or poke around in the depths to be found elsewhere. And those depths are still there to be explored - with all that the additions bring, I'd argue that Rise is as deep as Monster Hunter has ever been. It's just that those depths have been made a little easier to get to, which is surely no bad thing.  It's all enough to make me believe that this really might be the Monster Hunter for all, and as much as World pushed the series into the mainstream it's Rise that could yet propel it to be a phenomenon - and at the very least it'll earn the series some new fans along the way. If you've been put off by the challenge, the investment or even the action, Rise does its very best to smooth the path and open up Monster Hunter's charms to all. If you're already smitten with the series like I am? Well, Monster Hunter Rise might well be as good as video games can get.You're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!

Here’s how it works.Monster Hunter Rise is a great adventure, providing fascinating new tools like the Wirebug and walking a fine line between arcade and fast-paced HD gameplay.

Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy.Sometimes smaller really is better. After the highs of Monster Hunter: World’s astounding success, it’d be reasonable for Capcom to shoot for an even bigger, more complicated game. Instead, though, the Monster Hunter development team has opted for a smaller, more personal adventure, trading in World’s sprawling plains and snow-capped mountain ranges for a decidedly more low-key tale in Monster Hunter Rise.As the titular monster hunter, the silent protagonist awakens to life in the small village of Kamura on the frontier, embarking on quests for the population to slay tyrannical beasts patrolling the wilderness. Monster Hunter Rise is a hack-and-slash action game at its core, but one with a graceful elegance through its 14 varied weapon types and devastating skill combos.Monster Hunter Rise strikes an impressively delicate balance between gameplay styles. It’s pulling from World’s hefty numbers game and hidden mishmash of systems, and older Monster Hunter games' more arcade-like combat of hammering buttons. The result is something incredible: Rise feels fast and fluid, unshackling itself from many of World’s intricate design systems and feeling more open and inviting for newcomers who just want to slap a monster around.Nowhere is the combat’s fresh pacing better embodied than the Wirebug. A small, unassuming tool, it quickly becomes apparent that the Wirebug has a crucial part to play in every aspect of Monster Hunter Rise’s gameplay. The tool can be used to propel the player into the air, grappling onto ledges to reach higher vantage points, and bringing an excellent sense of verticality to Rise’s biomes. It can even be used to evade a monster’s attacks, pulling the player from the literal jaws of defeat. In combat though, the Wirebug is used to initiate devastating moves, as simply pressing two buttons unleashes a powerful attack for any of the 14 different weapon types.The Wirebug has different actions for every single weapon in Monster Hunter Rise. With the switch axe, for example, it’ll chain together a massive spin attack when used, whereas using it with the long sword propels the hunter up into the air, latching onto a monster and slashing downwards through it. The Wirebug is a brilliant addition to Rise, one that brings a crucial new gameplay element to every weapon, giving series veterans something new to learn and newcomers dependable attacks to learn from. The Wirebug uses are tied to a cooldown timer, so rather than becoming a fundamental of combat, it acts like a crutch to support the player when the going gets tough.All of this is supported by a supple tutorial system. Rise starts out small, making sure the player knows every base combat mechanic and how to use each weapon, before delving into the more complicated territory of the Wirebug, blights, elements, and more. In 2018 it was incredibly easy to get overwhelmed by World’s vast systems and monsters right out of the gate, but Rise does a far better job of making sure rookie hunters and experienced slayers alike are acclimated to the inner workings of the game before turning you loose against deadly beasts.The monsters themselves are an eclectic bunch. Series stalwarts like the fiery Anjanath and the poisonous Rathian return, joined by some utterly nightmare-inducing creatures like the ghastly Khezu. Every monster has something defining that you’ll remember them for: the Khezu can snake its slithery neck around the battlefield like a whip, and the Bishaten uses its claw-like tail to sling poisonous fruits at you. I’ll always have a reaction to seeing any of Rise’s brilliant cast out in the wild: it could be a “oh this guy” when a Rathian swoops down on me, or a harrowing scream when the Khezu roams into view. Every single one of Rise’s creatures are memorable in some fashion, no small feat when there’s well over 20 in the base game.There’s not so much of a focus on co-op gameplay in the smaller monster hunts, but that changes the further you progress into Rise’s story. The game’s plot is divided into two paths of progression: village missions, which are designed to be smaller, lower level fights to be overcome by solo players, and bigger hub missions, which require a team of hunters working in close tandem with one another to best. The single-player village missions wrap up decidedly earlier than the co-op hub missions, forcing players down a path of working together with online companions to see the conclusion of Rise’s story. It’s a puzzling design choice - especially for the Nintendo Switch, a console that isn’t exactly known for its robust online infrastructure.Still, Rise’s online features manage to work well within the confines of the Switch’s online capabilities. Approaching the feline mailman in Kamura Village lets the player search for a lobby of four hunters, or set up one of your own, giving you the option to invite friends in or group up with anyone. There’s mercifully very little busywork in getting going with Rise’s online features, and the quick-chat options being a button away and offering a litany of supportive shouts like “capture the monster” or “hold on!” feel catered to strangers working in greater harmony with one another to overcome ferocious hunting quests.Outside of the hunting quests though, Rise introduces a new tower defense-like mode called Rampage. The outset of Rise’s story talks up Rampages as threatening Kamura Village and being the driving point of the story, and that all comes to a head in a fortified arena, where one or several hunters run around installing defenses like ballistas, cannons, and traps to repel the onslaught of monsters before the gates to Kamura Village are breached. The Rampages start off as the focal point of Rise’s story, but quickly find their groove as a way to break up the routine hunting quests.The Rampages are pleasantly enjoyable in the moment but can become increasingly frustrating when you’re faced with monsters that bounce the hunter between them like a volleyball. Rampages further in the game starring elite monsters almost demand to be taken on by a squad of hunters, especially when the AI comrades you can place in ballistas and cannons barely make a dent in the hordes facing Kamura. Despite the frustrations though, Rampages are used sparingly throughout Monster Hunter Rise’s critical story path, offering something new to the standard hunts instead of being a backbone to support the core gameplay loop.Monster Hunter Rise is a great debut for Capcom’s franchise on the Nintendo Switch, smartly providing sublime new tools to the established arsenal like the Wirebug, and acting as a welcoming point of entry for newcomers with overly welcoming tutorial segments. There’s a lot to like about the Rampage missions as a headline addition for the series, however harrowing they might become to face on your own in the latter half of the game. Monster Hunter Rise has the satisfying feeling of a smaller and more compact adventure than 2018’s sprawling World, but tying story progression to the game’s online co-op mode is a little disappointing.Reviewed on Nintendo Switch.

Monster Hunter Rise,Jason Guisao,Game Informer,https://www.gameinformer.com/review/monster-hunter-rise/runt-of-the-litter,"Monster Hunter: World was an important paradigm shift for Capcom’s beloved franchise. The well-paced difficulty ramp made progression enjoyable for newcomers, while countless endgame challenges kept expert hunters coming back for more. Monster Hunter Rise’s gameplay often attempts to copy World’s success, which isn’t always a bad thing. Battles continue to be an exhilarating dance with death, gear customization is satisfying, and coordinating hunts with friends makes for awesome fun and unexpected outcomes. Even with the introduction of new mechanics that help amplify these features, Monster Hunter Rise struggles to establish a creative identity of its own.Encounters with huge and impressive beasts is the centerpiece of the experience, putting your skills with the myriad weapon types to the test. Once victorious, you spend your downtime sprinting around the main hub, upgrading or forging better equipment, nabbing a bunch of pending quests from NPCs, and meticulously preparing for the next hunt. This captures the fundamentals of the fantasy-action series, but Monster Hunter Rise doesn’t venture far beyond that comfort zone.During the opening hours, the people of Kamura Village are busy preparing for the “calamity,” an army of wild monsters hell-bent on laying waste to everything in their path. As the village’s newly registered hunter, you must slay or capture numerous creatures in the biomes beyond your hometown’s steel gates. As soon as you’re done marveling at the blooming cherry blossom trees and humming along to the gorgeous score, be sure to grab key consumables from your ever-expanding item box, eat a delicious meal at the local eatery for exclusive bonuses, and venture forth into the unknown. This routine has a comfortable monotony that Monster Hunter fans will likely appreciate, but the addition of the “Buddy Plaza” adds a new feature to your return trips.The Buddy Plaza is a base of operations for your palicoes and palamutes (cat and dog warriors, respectively). You can send your trusty pets on missions of their own to procure miscellaneous crafting materials, spend currency to train them so that they’ll be more effective in future engagements, swap out their equipment, or hire even more of them by talking to the handler. Buddies are extremely versatile, and Monster Hunter: Rise constantly rewards you for using the plaza’s various facilities. Still grinding for that rare beak or tail? Your palico “meowcenaries” might surprise you with one from a recent expedition. This kind of positive feedback gives the lulls between combat/exploration some much-needed flavor.The environments are visually arresting, and house entire ecosystems filled to the brim with endemic life as well as hard-to-find secrets. My two favorite locales – Shrine Ruins and Flooded Forest – are littered with the remnants of ancient civilizations; they have huts wrapped in thick vines and sky-piercing pyramids that loom in the distance. While roaming, I often thought about the histories of these forsaken settlements and the people that once called them home. However, my imagination was often all I had to go on, since the lack of meaningful story beats makes the plot fall flat.A generic tower defense mode serves as a lackluster reminder of the larger narrative; these jarring “rampage quests” involve constructing an array of automated turrets and mountable ballistae around the village’s gates. Waves of monsters clutter the screen and work together to pummel you while also breaking through your defenses. All the enemies are damage sponges, and clearing the arena hardly requires much thought; I often just held the fire button until I was the last one standing. Thankfully, you aren’t required to complete a ton of rampage quests to gain access to Monster Hunter Rise’s main missions.You spend most of your playthrough experiencing the classic loop: Battle gigantic adversaries like the feral Arzuros and Lagombi, collect mundane items, and deliver heavy objects to camp. Be sure to explore the nooks and crannies of every map as floating, colorful birds called “Spiribirds” can be absorbed to increase your health, stamina, attack, or defense. These buffs make completing the above-mentioned missions much easier. Don’t want to do all of that on foot? Ride your palamute to expedite navigation or whip out your wirebug to scale cliffsides and mountain ranges in seconds.Wirebug attacks, called Silkbinds, add a new layer of intensity to the action. When used repeatedly, Silkbinds force monsters into a mountable state. These short combat sequences are all about using a monster’s power against them by ramming into nearby structures for stagger damage or sprinting towards other unsuspecting adversaries to dish out the pain. Wyvern-riding is my favorite mechanic because it adds an exciting burst of strategy to the franchise’s age-old combat system.Beyond mounting monsters and using the wirebug to wall-run in spectacular fashion, not much else distinguishes Monster Hunter Rise from the installments that came before. It has enough endgame content to keep you occupied long after the credits roll (if you don’t mind copious amounts of grinding) and multiplayer is still the optimal way to play, but the excitement of my early hunts waned before long. Monster Hunter Rise is far from being the next definitive chapter in the series. Nevertheless, if you’re looking for a polished-but-conventional adventure with a few small-scale nuances, then you’ll be right at home in Kamura Village.

Its PC port makes it the definitive version of one of 2021's best gamesBy

   on January 11, 2022 at 9:37AM PSTThe locations you explore in Monster Hunter Rise have already felt the delicate touch of humanity's hand. Traditional Japanese torii can be found weaving through mountainside paths, leading to sacred shrines, while decaying temples have been reclaimed by nature as local plant life envelops the aging architecture. Signs of human life can even be found at the base of a raging volcano and in the midst of a flooded forest, where a Mesoamerican-style pyramid dominates the landscape.If 2018's Monster Hunter World was all about unearthing a new continent as an intrepid frontiersman, then Rise is a triumphant return to the Old World with valuable lessons learned. An enhanced port of the 3DS title Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate may have already graced the Nintendo Switch, but Rise is the first game in the series built from the ground up for Nintendo's latest console. As such, Rise closely follows in the footsteps of World while reneging on some of its changes and introducing plenty of new impactful ideas that excellently shift the focus towards the series' heart-pumping action.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Monster Hunter Rise Video ReviewThe core Monster Hunter gameplay loop has remained relatively unchanged as you hunt down gargantuan monsters, harvest their materials to craft new weapons and armor, and tackle increasingly tougher foes. World coalesced both the single and multiplayer parts of the experience into one cohesive whole, but Rise reverts back to the old ways by splitting them into disparate Village and Hub quests. Village quests can only be played alone, while Hub quests can still be tackled solo but are designed with multiple players in mind. This isn't the most welcome setup for newcomers since it isn't immediately clear which quests progress the story, nor is there any indication of whether or not you should be alternating between both paths. The impact this structure has on the game isn't as substantial as it initially seems, though. Hunting the same monster multiple times has always been a part of Monster Hunter's DNA, so repeating the same mission as both a Village and Hub quest is something you would typically seek out anyway.That's not to say Rise isn't approachable in other areas either. There's a renewed focus on fast-paced action that strikes an impressive balance between being welcoming for newcomers and satisfying for battle-hardened veterans. When entering a location, for example, your trusty pet Cahoot will mark all of the nearby monsters on your map. You won't immediately know the identity of each one until you've already discovered them, but this cuts down on the time it takes to seek out your foe and gets you into the heart of the action much faster. It's an ideal fit for the Switch's handheld mode, allowing you to jump in and out of its most thrilling moments without having to engage with the long-winded slog to find and follow a monster's tracks.Exploration is still a key part of the experience, even if you know the exact location of your prey. There are plenty of shortcuts and hidden paths to uncover within each location, and the addition of local wildlife--known as Endemic Life--encourages you to seek out every nook and cranny in order to gain the temporary buffs to damage output, stamina regeneration, and so on, that they offer. On the flip side, if you're not interested in boosting specific stats to get a leg up in battle, you can always ignore the Endemic Life and tailor the challenge to your liking. Rise offers a degree of flexibility in the way you're able to tackle each monster that goes beyond your choice of weapon and armor.With that being said, the verticality afforded by the new Wirebug mechanic has the most significant impact on Rise's exploration. This exciting new tool allows you to zip through the air by utilizing what's known as Wire-dashing. From here, you can chain moves together, mixing in wall runs with additional Wire-dashes to reach previously unattainable heights and traverse the environment at a rapid pace. The finesse it requires takes some getting used to, and you still need to be shrewd with the Wirebug's forgiving cooldown to be successful, but it's an incredibly fun tool to use once you're comfortable with its demands.There's a renewed focus on fast-paced action that strikes an impressive balance between being welcoming for newcomers and satisfying for battle-hardened veterans.The Wirebug also plays an important role in combat, as each of Rise's 14 signature weapons has its own Silkbind attacks. These unique moves are relatively easy to pull off and range from a timing-based counter with the Long Sword to an uppercut leading into an explosive downward strike with the Switch Axe. Each Silkbind attack can be linked into different combos, opening up your repertoire of potential techniques, and the Wirebug expands on this even further with its defensive maneuvers. The evasive Wirefall move, for instance, gives you an opportunity to get back on your feet and avoid a monster's follow-up attack after being knocked down or pushed back, while the Wire-dash extends the reach of your dodge for when you need to quickly evade a rampaging beast.Aside from the addition of Silkbind attacks, each of Rise's weapon types have remarkable depth in keeping with the series' traditions. Mastering a particular weapon is just as rewarding as before, and there's also an element of customization available this time around too. The aptly named Switch Skills allow you to swap out certain regular and Silkbind attacks to make a weapon that's reflective of your play style and preferences. An improved training area, and a reduction in the amount of materials necessary to upgrade a new weapon, also makes this aspect of the game more approachable for newcomers who need to experiment in order to find a weapon type that suits them.Stamina and weapon sharpness have also been streamlined thanks to the addition of Palemutes. These new dog-like buddies will help you out in combat and can be decked out with weapons that only add to Rise's combat depth, and they also act as mounts for you to ride any time you want. Stamina isn't consumed when you're on the back of your trusted Palemute, and you can even sharpen your weapon while traversing to give you something productive to do during travel, thus alleviating some of the more time-consuming aspects of Monster Hunter.Multiplayer is also a hassle-free experience, whether you're playing with a group of friends or with up to three strangers. The wait times are relatively short when joining an online hunt, and lag is a non-issue on Nintendo’s new online infrastructure. The frame rate holds up, too, even when the screen is awash with multiple hunters, particle effects, and the beasts themselves. And this is to say nothing of how good Rise is as a multiplayer game. There’s nothing else quite like gathering a party to go and hunt down an imposing adversary, and Rise’s new features only add to the inherent joy you can glean from its hectic cooperative action. Not to mention the fact that it gives support-oriented weapons--such as the reworked Hunter Horn--time to shine.There is a basic story that sets all of this up by casting you as Kamura Village's sole hunter, but the narrative is little more than a paper-thin vehicle for introducing Rise's new mechanics and game modes. Chief among the latter is the Rampage: a special mission type that requires you to defend a stronghold from waves of ferocious monsters. The Rampage is inspired by Japanese folklore and the Hyakki Yagyō ""Night Parade of One Hundred Demons"" idiom in particular, which sees an uncontrollable horde of yokai march into our world. In gameplay terms, the Rampage is similar to a tower defense game, tasking you with placing various hunting installations around each stronghold in order to repel the frenzied invaders. Some of these installations are automatic and manned by NPC companions, while others can be manually controlled if you fancy dishing out some damage of your own with ballistas, cannons, and other heavy weaponry.Rampage quests offer a respite from the usual Monster Hunter formula, delivering histrionic thrills as you find yourself bombarded by multiple monsters at once. There's some satisfying depth to it as well, with progression rewarding you with more powerful installations and upgraded weapons. You can even jump into the action as you would on any other monster hunt, or lure the enemy to specific points on the battlefield to unleash devastating attacks with powerful installations like the Dragonator and the Splitting Wyvernshot. Completing a Rampage quest will reward you with the usual assortment of monster parts with which to craft weapons and armor, but you're also incentivized to finish them in order to unlock Defender Tickets. These can be spent on numerous Rampage Skills that permanently boost specific weapons stats such as attack, affinity, and defense.Part of what makes the Rampage so exciting is the addition of Wyvern Riding to your offensive arsenal. Monster riding was first introduced in Monster Hunter 4, but it's had a significant shakeup in Rise. By performing a series of Silkbind and aerial attacks, a monster will enter a mountable state that allows you to hop on their back and go for a ride. You can launch your helpless prey into walls to deal damage and put them in a downed state that leaves them vulnerable for a time, or you can use them as a massive battering ram to attack other monsters. This is a tad cumbersome due to some stiff controls, but being able to ravage the monster you're hunting with another beast is a singular treat that adds a tinge of kaiju-esque action to the proceedings--not to mention the strategic considerations it introduces to each hunt. Monsters will occasionally bump into each other and fight over territory, but you can also use Wyvern Riding to seek out another monster and force them into a confrontation, creating emergent moments that enhance the game's core combat.The monsters themselves consist of fan favorites such as Rathian, Diablos, and Puki-Puki, along with plenty of new monsters and a few surprises. Much like the Rampage, each of the new beasts are inspired by yokai and other legendary creatures from Japanese folklore. The menacing Somnacath, for example, is based on Japanese mermaids, which have the lower body of a fish and the upper body of a demon. It's a fascinating creature to fight as it moves through the water like a sea otter before putting you to sleep with its siren's song. Bishaten, on the other hand, is inspired by tengu, presenting an ape-like monster with the face of a crow and a dangerous tail the shape of tengu's fan. Aside from using its rear appendage to deal damage, the Bishaten also throws large pieces of fruit at you, making it one of the more peculiar monsters in the bestiary.Going toe-to-toe with these intimidating beasts is the unmistakable core of the Monster Hunter experience, and Rise still feels like a distinctly Monster Hunter game, even if it's more of a fully-fledged action title than any other entry in the series. This renewed focus doesn't diminish its layered RPG mechanics, nor does it dumb down on any single aspect of the hunt. Certain changes make Rise a more approachable game for newcomers, but you also have the freedom to tailor the experience to your liking. The moment-to-moment combat is as impeccable as it's ever been and puts Rise on a pedestal as one of the feathers in the Nintendo Switch's cap.Monster Hunter Rise was one of 2021's best games. It still delivered the quintessential Monster Hunter experience of killing increasingly large monsters with increasingly powerful weapons, but Capcom also stripped away a lot of the fat to deliver the most dynamic and accessible entry in the series thus far. After almost a year of Nintendo Switch exclusivity, Rise has now made its way to PC with a souped-up port that improves on what was already a fantastic game in almost every way.The most obvious improvements are, of course, visual, as it comes with all of the bells and whistles you would expect from a snazzy PC port. The addition of high-quality textures results in a sharper and more detailed image even when bumping the resolution up to 4K, and the system requirements are lenient enough that you can get it running at 60fps or higher with every graphical setting maxed out on even moderate hardware. There are a few new graphical settings like motion blur and depth of field that can be toggled on or off to add an extra layer of fidelity, and support for ultra-wide monitors is also included. It's incredibly well-optimized right out of the box, too, which wasn't the case when Monster Hunter World launched on PC back in 2018. Rise isn't as hardware intensive, but it's always nice when you don't have to wait for post-launch patches for a game to reach its full potential.Monster Hunter has always had a deliberate pace, especially during combat where timing your moves and their locked animations is an essential skill. As such, the increase in performance afforded by the PC version isn't a game-changer, although it's still difficult to return to the Switch release after experiencing Rise at a buttery smooth frame rate. The new wirebug mechanic completely alters the flow of traversal and exploration by letting you effortlessly zip around the environment, and it's here where the unlocked frame rate really shines. Rise is also a much snappier game than its predecessors, and the PC version's faster load times take this a step further by getting you into the action almost instantaneously.Keyboard and mouse support is also robust, letting you set shortcuts and new key bindings until it's palatable on something other than a gamepad. If you are using a controller, however, the gyro-aiming found in the Switch version is absent here, despite the PC port being compatible with both the Switch Pro controller and the PS5's DualSense. You're not going to miss it if this is your first time playing Rise, but for those who became accustomed to tilting the controller when soaring above the ground with the wirebug, it might take a while to acclimatize to solely using the right stick again.If you did play Rise on the Switch and are wondering whether the PC version is worth picking up, one of the most significant aspects you'll have to take into consideration is the absence of cross-play and cross-save. Capcom is unable to implement these features for both Rise and its upcoming Sunbreak expansion, so if you've already invested hours into depleting Kamura's monster population, you'll have to do it all over again if you want those visual and performance boosts.Fortunately, there is some new content to sink your teeth into if you haven't played the Switch version in a while and are making the jump to PC. All of Rise's free post-launch content is included up to version 3.6.1, with tougher apex monster variants to hunt and special event quests that feature collaborations with the likes of Okami, Street Fighter, Mega Man, and Sonic the Hedgehog. Capcom is also planning on syncing content between the Switch and PC versions at the end of February, so the PC won't be lagging behind when new content drops. Meanwhile, the Sunbreak expansion is scheduled to launch on both Switch and PC at the same time when it releases sometime this summer.Monster Hunter: Rise is still a technical marvel on Switch, but the graphical and performance enhancements present in this PC port make it the definitive version of one of 2021's best games. It will even retain its portability if you're planning on picking up a Steam Deck later this year. For those who already own Rise on Switch, picking up the PC version will come down to how willing you are to replay the game from the beginning. For everyone else, it should be a no-brainer.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"
Monster Hunter Rise,Ryan Gilliam,Polygon,https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22344620/monster-hunter-rise-review-switch,"Filed under:Helping new players adjust quickly, giving veteran players a way to flex their skillsThe movement in Monster Hunter Rise finally clicked for me as I soared above the Lagombi’s head.The Lagombi is an obnoxious Monster Hunter beast, a bearlike critter that slides on its belly at high speeds. When it would slide, I would dodge, but it didn’t take long for me to realize that I wasn’t doing a good job. Movements left and right were too slow; I needed to think vertically. I started anticipating the Lagombi’s slides even before I finished the first fight. Then I used my new Wirebug to soar into the sky and hang high above my prey below. The beast tired itself out looking for me, and I fell from the heavens and hit the monster with a massive blow from my hammer. This is not the Monster Hunter of Monster Hunter: World. Rise is faster — players have far more in-game mobility, and it’s an even better starting place for new Hunters. The Monster Hunter series is known for being unfriendly to newcomers, with deliberate combat and loads of complex menus to navigate. Players gather resources, take on lengthy boss fights with energetic monsters, and skin their prey to make better gear for the next hunt. The series is slow-moving, a trait that offers finesse to players who master its timing, but can throw off newbies trying to survive their first hunt. The Wirebug — a living creature that gives you the ability to dash through the sky like Spider-Man  — changes that. The X button takes me straight into the air, and A dashes me forward while holding the ZL trigger on my Switch. I can also hold ZL to aim my Wirebug more precisely, hitting ZR when I’m ready to fly a short distance. I can press A in midair to hang from a Wirebug indefinitely, or B after getting hit by a monster to get myself back on my feet. The variety in movement options offers a level of finesse I’ve never had in a Monster Hunter game before.Polygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences.

If you want curated lists of our favorite media, check out What to Play and What to Watch.The Wirebug is not a tool you need to equip in Monster Hunter Rise; it’s an unlimited system with a short cooldown, and it’s always with you, even back in town when you’re crafting weapons. I have two Wirebugs when I start a hunt. I can use them back to back to dash twice as far, or just one at a time to get myself in the air for a quick strike. I can climb a mountain by alternating between zipping and running up the side. The Wirebug opens up the entire map as playable space, instead of the prebuilt alleyways and arenas from previous games where I can battle beasts and collect mushrooms. This mobility helps give Rise a more modern feel than its predecessors. Instead of lying on the ground after a big hit, I can use my Wirebug to recover in midair. It lets me pull myself to safety and heal before the monster can catch me again. I don’t only have to choose between dodging left or right; I can also dodge up. I can escape a fight by scaling a mountain, or follow a retreating monster by zipping over some buildings. I have more chances to save myself from the often brutal enemy AI. But that mobility cuts both ways. As it lowers Rise’s skill floor, it also raises the skill ceiling, allowing for incredible plays. I started Rise using the Wirebug just to dodge and recover, but it didn’t take me long to learn how to zip around fights and bash on the monster from creative angles. I can zip to dodge an attack, dodge again in midair, and bring my hammer down on the monster’s head with a crack. It’s a satisfying feeling, being in complete control of my movements.The Wirebug gets even more complex. I can spend my Wirebug charges to do powerful Silkbind moves, which deal a special kind of damage that tires monsters and allows me to ride them.Monster Hunter: World allowed me to ride on a monster’s back and knock it over to damage it. But Wyvern Riding, the new mounting system in Rise, is something else entirely. When I climb aboard my monster, I’m no longer a Hunter from the small village of Kamura. I am the Tigrex or the Magnamalo, and I can use this powerful body to deal some major damage. This breaks up the monotony of the 20- to 30-minute hunts that new players go through — but, like all things in Rise, it also allows veterans to prove their skills. The Wirebug changes the entire pace of Rise. Monsters attack faster because I can dodge faster. Areas are more vertical because I have the means to climb hills, mountains, buildings, cliffs, and bluffs. It’s freeing, and it makes Monster Hunter: World — barely three years old and the current gold standard for accessible monster hunting games — seem archaic and slow by comparison.The Wirebug creates a host of gameplay opportunities outside of Monster Hunter’s minute-to-minute combat, and Rise’s new Rampage mode is perhaps the best example of what’s now possible. Rampage is a tower defense quest that takes place in a variety of arenas, all situated around the village of Kamura. A horde of monsters is attacking your home, and you need to fend them off. All of Rise’s improvements make its ending that much more disappointing. Without getting into specifics, the game ends very abruptly prior to its planned April update, which Capcom says will add a few monsters and uncap the Hunter Rank system. With the end of the story scheduled to arrive about a month after launch, and Monster Hunter games taking 40 hours or so to finish, this may not be an issue that will impact many hunters. But it’s worth knowing what you’re signing up for if you’re a hardcore player.Rampages play out in the game’s normal third-person perspective. But the arenas are huge, and the distance between where I am and where I need to be makes walking feel far too slow. I need to zip up and around the map to set up turrets and level up my base as I progress. The arenas have to be large to accommodate the size of some of these monsters, so a tower defense mode like this wouldn’t work without the Wirebug’s added mobility. The freedom to fly from one turret to the next prevents Rampages from ever being dull, and leaves me juggling turret repairs and setting new traps for the monsters — a welcome departure from the more structured hunts.Despite my Wirebug zipping, Rise is still Monster Hunter at its core. It still offers those bullshit moments, like watching helplessly as your Hunter gets carted back to town because you couldn’t get them up fast enough. These are the kind of frustrations that cause Monster Hunter vets to look at you and shrug because ... yeah, that’ll happen. Rise’s more modern sensibilities don’t eliminate deaths that feel unfair or stuns that seem too long. The monster should be able to knock me out the same way I can knock it out, by Monster Hunter’s own philosophy. But Rise is another moment of growth in the series. The bullshit still exists, and the monsters still frustrate, but new players won’t run into these nuisances as often as they used to, because now they have more tools to save themselves with. Monster Hunter Rise takes the accessible foundation that Capcom built in World and expands on it without breaking what makes Monster Hunter fun, including the deep combat and the feeling of progression as you defeat, skin, and wear one monster to fight the next. If World was the first step forward into a new era of Monster Hunter, Rise takes it even further. Monster Hunter: World was a game I would recommend to friends, with some caveats. But Rise’s gameplay variety and mobility — all fueled by that little Wirebug — make it a must-try game for Monster Hunter skeptics and hardcore fans alike.

Jason Faulkner 
Monster Hunter: World was a massive hit, with 17 million+ copies sold across PS4, Xbox One, and PC. The Switch missed out on the fun, but a game specifically for that system (and PC sometime next year), Monster Hunter Rise, has been in co-development and is finally about to release.Since Capcom created Rise concurrently with Monster Hunter: World, players can expect many similarities. It has the same open-world design, which has players hunting monsters on one expansive map. The gameplay is similar as well, with all 14 weapon types carrying over and controlling almost exactly the same. When it comes to the core loop of hunting monsters, crafting gear, and hunting stronger monsters, Rise feels more like an expansion to World than a new game.However, the transition to weaker hardware hasn’t done the series any favors. It runs smooth, which is a testament to Capcom’s development skills, but it does so at the cost of some of the smaller details that make Monster Hunter: World such an engaging title. However, it does include a few new mechanics that somewhat make up for this.Rise takes players to Kamura Village and runs with a Japanese motif for the hub area. The story is a lot lighter this time around as you’re not exploring a whole new continent. Instead, you’re just a Kamura Village hunter who is just starting their career. Instead of chasing down Zorah Magederos and discovering the mystery behind the Elder Dragons’ migration, you’re just trying to keep your village safe.In Rise, Kamura Village is put in danger by a phenomenon called “The Rampage.” For some reason, monsters in the surrounding areas are becoming more aggressive and sometimes even attacking the town in waves. This part of the story gives players access to a new survival-type mode where you have to defend the village from attack. Before and during the attack, you can set up defensive positions and give orders to NPCs. Solving the mystery behind these attacks is a big part of the plot, which seems to mostly exist in this game as an impetus for you to hunt monsters.Kamura Village is much more compact than Astera or Seliana, which makes navigation easier. However, I found myself missing the hustle and bustle of the two hubs found in Monster Hunter: World. I also missed the hook in World that we were researching the beasts we were killing or capturing. It gave a deeper purpose behind hunting than, “Oh, that monster is causing a ruckus!” Kamura Village has a cool aesthetic, and the NPCs are likable; it just feels like a step backward.Because the game is on the Switch, a console that many people play on the go, there are some changes to gameplay to make hunts more streamlined. For one, you no longer have to discover major monsters to track them on the map. Cahoots, the new owl companion that replaces Scoutflies, automatically places markers for each major monster on the map. The icons don’t initially tell you which creature is which, but this eliminates the need to follow tracks and environmental clues to find major monsters.The Palamutes are one of two big additions to the game, and stand alongside the Felynes as companions. These new dog buddies fight alongside you in battle, but most importantly, you can ride them on hunts. Being able to ride Palamutes basically puts each hunt into turbo mode because they’re significantly faster than the player character, and you expend no stamina when you’re riding them. You can use many items while on your Palamute, like the Whetstone, rations, and potions, which means you can get prepared to fight while traveling to your target.Hunters also get a new tool to use in Rise, the Wirebug, which acts as an evolution of the Clutch Claw introduced in Monster Hunter World: Iceborne. This tool lets you launch into the air to dodge an enemy attack quickly or to traverse gaps. It also allows for more verticality, as you can use Wirebug charges in quick succession to climb to places you otherwise couldn’t reach.The Wirebug also introduces the Silkbinding mechanic. The Wirebug can be used in conjunction with your main weapon to produce new combos. These combos, when landed correctly, can snare a monster, allowing you to engage in Wyvern Riding. However, Wyvern Riding can also be made possible when a monster gets knocked down during a Turf War, something that is more common in Rise than in World.Wyvern Riding allows you to mount a monster, and instead of just attacking them, you get a limited amount of control over them. You can use strong and weak attacks on an enemy or cause the monster to slam itself into the nearest wall. There’s also a gauge you can fill up by evading or landing attacks when Wyvern Riding that allow you to execute a Mounted Punisher attack which causes major damage to an opponent.Because of the increased opportunity to do damage with Wyvern Riding, hunts are typically over much quicker in Rise. Fights later in the game are still tough, but some of the monsters that were challenging for early players in World, like the Pukei-Pukei, are much easier to take down.While Rise nails the fundamental gameplay of Monster Hunter, it feels lacking when it comes to worldbuilding. One of the things that drew me into Monster Hunter: World is how thought out each monster’s place in the environment is. I loved that you had to track monsters, spying out footprints, disturbed plantlife, and excrement.Unfortunately, though the maps are large in Monster Hunter Rise, they don’t feel quite as natural as those found in World. Rise’s locations feel more like video game maps, with medium-sized arenas to fight monsters in connected by narrower corridors. There are less shortcuts and cramped passages than in World, which leaves each map with a constructed feeling.The amount of endemic life also seems to be toned down. Instead of having a ton of critters to capture in nets and collect, most of the endemic life is are either items to pick up (Dung Beetles), instant use (Flashbugs), or the new Spiritbirds that buff you as you collect them.Most players likely won’t notice that Rise puts less emphasis on worldbuilding, but it was disappointing to me. Rise has great gameplay, but there’s a lot more emphasis on the hunt. It’s likely a side effect of the game being on Switch more than anything, which makes me wish that it was a second expansion to Monster Hunter: World rather than a separate title.Capcom did an amazing job distilling the gameplay experience of Monster Hunter: World into a streamlined form for the Nintendo Switch. Hunts are easier to get into and faster to complete, but they still give the challenge that fans loved from previous games. There’s also just enough new mechanics to make Rise feel like a step forward, even if it’s only a small one.Fans who love Monster Hunter exclusively for the hunts will likely welcome the raised emphasis on taking on major monsters as quickly as possible. However, Rise is missing some of the worldbuilding of Monster Hunter: World, which will make it feel a bit emptier for players who prefer to stop and smell the roses.9Jason Faulkner is the Senior Editor of Game Revolution and PlayStation LifeStyle.

Monster Hunter Rise,Chris Carter,Destructoid,https://www.destructoid.com/stories/review-monster-hunter-rise-622463.phtml,"darkIt’s weird to think how Monster Hunter low key became Capcom’s top franchise in an instant.While Street Fighter and Resident Evil still reign supreme overall, with multiple entries dotting the top 10 list, Monster Hunter is the absolute king with over 16 million units of Monster Hunter World sold.Why would Capcom stop now?Monster Hunter Rise (PC, Nintendo Switch [reviewed])
Developer: Capcom
Publisher: Capcom
Released: March 26, 2021
MSRP: $59.99Monster Hunter is a fascinating series, mostly because of how open-ended it is.Nearly everyone’s experience is different. Whether that involves frustration or elation at any given moment is entirely up to you. Even as a veteran, it can be a mix of both! But Monster Hunter Rise has so much personality, and adds several key mechanics into the mix, that it elicits far more joy than suffering, so long as you’re willing to work with it.As is the case with most entries, Rise once again tasks players with literally hunting down various big bad beasties, with a variety of weapons and playstyles. Once you’ve bested them, you can skin them for parts, gear up, upgrade, and repeat the process; solo, or with friends. You do this until you kill a really big monster in the main storyline, then kill more monsters in a postgame.The general flow is still the same. But Rise has the benefit of working with a very clear theme (feudal Japan) as a throughput. Rather than becoming numb to the environments and the game’s hub zone, I embraced them, and started to take notice of all of its colorful nuances. The NPCs grew on me in a way that many hadn’t before! And the beautiful, majestic soundtrack drew me into the world even further.It can still be a slow start. A few of the early monsters are a little bland, as are the ins and outs of early equipment pieces and weapons. But ramp you will, and the creatures — and their lovely haiku intros — get even more interesting to look at aesthetically. Even some of the older concepts have a little more flair in Rise, as you witness them in a new light.If you felt like Monster Hunter was clunky in the past, the wirebug might change that notion. Think of it like a flavorful grappling hook, which can not only zoom you around the map for exploration purposes, but zip you around in combat as an action-centric dodge. Hunters have access to a recover ability (think fighting games when you get knocked down), which prevents you from getting stunlocked or comboed by enemies, as well as special wirebug moves.It’s up to you to govern your wirebug meter (which refills over time via a cooldown) and decide which enemy attacks are worth recovering from, how much ground you need to cover, and how useful your individual weapon powers are. It’s a neat little metagame that has a relatively low skill floor in terms of picking up the dodge element of the wirebug mechanic, while providing a high ceiling and opening up weapon tech.The Palamute (dog) companion deserves a special shout-out, too. While having a little deadly mutt running around is its own reward, you can ride it to get places quickly and chase down monsters. Period. In a game where you might be pursuing a creature four or five times a match, it breaks down the monotony. Riding monsters (who can quickly get from place to place and start bar fights with other creatures) similarly feels straightforward and to the point.Then there’s the rampage missions. These work kind of like a light tower-defense gimmick, allowing hunters to create weapon platforms in specific locations in an arena, as well as spring one-time-use traps or NPC powers. You can opt to pilot a platform (such as a bow gun or a cannon) yourself, or put an NPC in charge. It’s a little streamlined, but it is fun to see a handful of big monsters on-screen while you blow them up with heavy-duty weaponry. It’s more like controlled chaos, but given that the game doesn’t force you to do rampage missions en masse, it works out more like a welcome diversion than a slog.Playing through the “main story,” you can defeat the Magnamalo in one-on-one combat in around 15 hours. But as all Monster Hunter fans know, the game begins when the credits roll. After that’s said and done you’ll unlock a weapon and start the endgame with higher-rank monsters to hunt. Replaying rampage missions is also a treat, because the general chaos lends itself well to repeat viewings.Beyond that “village progress” questline, you’ll have access to the “hub progress” branch, which is the meat of the game. This is where you’ll make your way through the ranks fighting near-endless foes; with other people, if you so choose. Although my access to multiplayer was limited prior to launch (it was cut off at one point), Monster Hunter Rise is still very fun in terms of group coordination. With the wirebug, seeing everyone zip around is a treat.You also have the fairly deep buddy system to play around with, which operates with its own hub zone, and allows you to recruit more furry friends for off-screen adventures and item rewards. With 14 weapons to test and a very useful training ground (which shows button inputs, combos, and moves on-screen), it’s easy to get sucked into village life. There’s a good chunk of fun busywork abound if you want a break from hunting. I even found myself rewatching monster intros just to show my wife how cool/silly something looked; I’m not sure if I’ve ever done that!Like a lot of Monster Hunter games, I slowly started to get more and more acclimated to Rise until I hit a positive tipping point. Once it clicked, it was hard to go back to the old ways, before the wirebug opened up combat and the theme was arguably the most on-point it’s ever been. Rise should delight fans both new and old, as long as the former group is willing to work a little bit for it.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]SuperbA hallmark of excellence. There may be flaws, but they are negligible and won't cause massive damage.

Monster Hunter Rise,TJ Denzer,Shacknews,https://www.shacknews.com/article/123447/monster-hunter-rise-review-switching-up-the-hunt-in-all-the-right-ways,"New to Shacknews? Signup for a Free AccountAlready have an account? Login NowMonster Hunter Rise launches players into the next era of the franchise as it swings back onto the Nintendo Switch with Master Rank expertise.When I heard that the next major chapter of Monster Hunter was going not to the PS5, Xbox Series X/S, or PC (at least not right away), but rather starting out on the Nintendo Switch, I had my reservations. How could one not after the absolutely breathtaking experience that was Monster Hunter World and its expansion, Iceborne? I went into Monster Hunter Rise thinking I just wanted it to be adequate in comparison.I misjudged. Monster Hunter Rise is more than adequate. Its inclusion of familiar and new mechanics and an all-new full-fledged adventure packed with new and returning beasties would be enough to make Monster Hunter Rise of note. That said, the fact that it can bring all of these things to the table and then play proficiently offline and online makes this a must-have for any player looking for a quality and lengthy dragon-slaying adventure you’ll enjoy at home and on the road.Monster Hunter Rise brings players to the hugely far Eastern-inspired village of Kamura. There’s often a great deal of European, bohemian, and naval influence behind the home base settlements of Monster Hunter games, but Monster Hunter Rise makes no bones about the fact that it’s all about ninjas, shrine maidens, and further feudal Japanese iconography. More importantly, Kamura faces a problem. Every fifty years or so, a ruckus known as the Rampage stirs up the wyverns and drives them to attack Kamura in gathering masses. If Kamura is to survive, the Rampage must be driven back and defeated.That’s where you come in! As a budding hunter in Kamura, your task is to build your might, master your weapons and tools in increasingly dangerous hunts, learn to thwart the Rampage, and hunt down its source once and for all. As is often the case, the narrative of Monster Hunter is little more than corny buffer to get you to the action, but it does its job well enough. The whole point is getting you ready to hunt bigger and bigger beasties.Now I will say, getting you ready for the hunt is one area where Monster Hunter Rise is tedious and unintuitive. If you’re a seasoned Monster Hunter player, it probably won’t take you long to figure out what you remember, how it works, and the new tricks that go with it. Where it doesn’t do so great is for complete newbies. I’d say the first hour of Monster Hunter Rise is a dizzying array of tutorials that barrage you with information overload. There are some new things you'll need, but it’s still an annoying flood of info rather than thoughtfully training you learn up on what you can do.That aside, nearly all of the staples return, including the 14 classes of weaponry to explore, the eating before a hunt, the sending for supplies, and more. Palicos also return and they even have classes this time, like Healer to keep your health up or Bombardier to dish out explosive damage. They aren’t your only best friend in the lonely wild. Canine hunting partners known as Palamutes also make an entrance this game. These large pups can not only be equipped with special weapons, but you can also ride them like a steed and travel around maps quickly. Heck, while you’re moving on their backs, you can do things like drink a potion or sharpen your weapon on the ride. They're a fantastic addition to the overall solo squad – so much so that you can only choose to take a Palico or Palamute with you in multiplayer games. Slight bummer.Once you’ve prepped yourself, picked your weapon of choice, and readied to leave camp, you can head for the available locales. At first you just get the Shrine Ruins, but eventually you unlock various environments all with a myriad of opportunities to explore and unique creatures to pick apart for gear crafting materials. I’m not going to sit here and say the locales are as intricately gorgeous as Monster Hunter World’s were, but they are charming in their own right, featuring their own fun variety and style to keep your hunts interesting.The inhabitants that wander these locales are good too. Monster Hunter Rise features the return of a lot familiar creatures, as well as some new challenges to chase down. The likes of Great Izuchi, Aknosom, and Tetranadon join staples like Rathalos, Anjanath, Khezu, and plenty more. Each monster comes into the game in grand form, offering a unique challenge and equipment rewards for overcoming it. Monster Hunter Rise will still make you grind some monsters several times to get what you need, but generally the battles were so fun and intense that I hardly noticed.This is due in large part to several new elements throughout Monster Hunter Rise’s hunts and combat. For one, there’s the Permabuffers. These are bird-like little creatures that embue you with a stat gain if you come near them. There’s Attack, Defense, Stamina, and Health Permabuffers, and you can even equip certain accessories to boost one style of effects or another. It makes your pathing to collect these little critters as paramount as popping a Demondrug potion for attack or an Armorskin potion for defense at the start of the match.Then there’s the Wirebugs. These critters serve several purposes throughout the hunt. For one, you can use a Wirebug like a grappling shot to yank you forward or up to walls. If you hit a wall, you’ll run up it a bit before having to jump and Wirebug grapple again. You can use this to scale cliffs you otherwise couldn’t, and it adds player-controlled verticality to Monster Hunter Rise. There’s also Wirebug attacks. These are done using the Wirebug button with your usual attack buttons. They can do anything from sending out a barrage of silken slashes on the Long Sword to giving you temporary impenetrabale shields against an attack. Some weapons feel more limited or niche with these attacks, but it’s hard to complain about their inclusion on top of the usual move sets.The most delightful part of this is easily setting up Wyvern Riding. Monster Hunter Rise lost regular monster mounting, but by dealing damage with Wirebug attacks, utilizing Puppet Spiders found in the wild, or letting a wyvern get attacked by another wyvern, you can jump to take control of them. In this moment, you can use them to wage a battle on another monster and damage them severely, or you could just launch them into a wall, jump off, and wail on them while they’re recovering. No matter what, Wyvern Riding provides massive opportunities for big damage and stuns and despite regular mountings going away, Wyvern Riding feels highly bombastic and satisfying when you do it right.Finally, there's Rampage Quests. These are gate defending scenarios where you'll ward off several waves of Wyverns with automated and operable ballistas, cannons, machine guns, and bombs. These were basically tower defense sections, and while okay. I didn't really feel one way or the other about them.One of the things I was most concerned about coming into this review was online play in Monster Hunter Rise. Even if Capcom was running the servers, with Nintendo Switch Online, I was expecting very little. So, color me shocked when I hooked up a hunt with my colleague in Australia and the hunt was practically lag free - a completely smooth experience both when I hosted and he hosted a match. I was floored by how well it handled in even the most chaotic hunting moments. All of our hunts ran the same as when I was offline. I will note that Monster Hunter Rise's online menus are a convoluted joke for a game that has been around so long, asking you to do all sorts of extra presses to get to a place that would take one or two buttons in other games, but once I was in a hunt, it was hard to complain.Moreover, the game performed that well in docked and handheld mode for the Nintendo Switch. When I took the Switch off the dock to test it out, I was equally shocked to find it handled nearly as well as when docked. The only noticeable quirk in quality, was that objects at distance (like over fifty feet) are dulled and living entities are choppy in their movements. However, up close and in most combat range, I found the Nintendo Switch handled my exploration and battles with a maintained standard regardless of whether it was docked or not, quite the good news for anyone hoping to hunt on the go.When I think about the problems I have with Monster Hunter Rise… They are trite in comparison to the overall experience. Most of them are inconveniences that we can learn to deal with in time even if I'd say it's silly they're there at all at this point. Some are just mild ho-hums I wish were better. Overall however, Monster Hunter Rise was beyond anything I expected. The tried and true grind of Monster Hunter's giant beast battles is alive and performing exceedingly well for the Switch’s hardware. Its formula is also thoughtfully augmented with Palamutes, Wirebugs, and Wyvern Riding, all of which I’d love to see stay in the series after this game. Grab a friend, near or far, or make some new ones as you engage in Rise’s grand new hunt. I doubt you’ll be disappointed.This review is based upon a Nintendo Switch digital copy supplied by the publisher.

					Does suspend work well, even when online? 				
					Yes, I would just be sure to switch Online off before you suspend so you don't have people forming lobbies with you.				
					Sweet, so I can suspend mid hunt and resume whenever? 				
					I could google this but I’m guessing multiplayer requires multiple switches right? Not like Diablo.				
					Correct. You can't do multiplayer local play on the same switch.

Monster Hunter Rise,James Billcliffe,VG247,https://www.vg247.com/2021/03/23/monster-hunter-rise-review/,"In Monster Hunter Rise, the Rampage comes at you fast. With a face full of Pukei-Pukei poison and a sumo-wrestling hippo belly-bopping my front door to pieces, my hunter glacially lifts an antidote to his lips just in time to see two more monsters scale the fence in search of mischief. Maybe it’s just not my day. Built from the ground-up for Nintendo Switch with Capcom’s RE Engine, Monster Hunter Rise is a condensed experience, but not necessarily a reduced one, ticking all of the necessary boxes of a modern Monster Hunter, while scaling back some of the scope to deliver a tighter package on a less powerful machine. Despite the technical concessions, Rise still unmistakably feels like Monster Hunter. Where a lot of action games try to make their combat as fluid as possible, Monster Hunter Rise is content to flow as smoothly as frozen nutella spreads, with the same idiosyncratic chunk to all 14 weapons that gives the series its distinctive handling. As always, supping a potion feels like brewing a pot of tea, as your character ambles out of the way of whatever huge and onrushing beast has caused you injury in the first place with all of the urgency of George Martin writing the last Game of Thrones books. It sounds like a nightmare, but in practise it makes for painstakingly deliberate, unblinkingly intense scraps that’re satisfying hefty in just the right way when you eventually click with the right weapon for you.  
 
However, the new Wirebug zipline ability, which has been added for Monster Hunter Rise, adds a bit more freedom, momentum, and impetus to your mobility. By holstering your weapon and holding the left trigger, you can shoot out a Spider-Man-style silk string which pulls you in any direction - including up into the air. It’s a powerful tool for closing the distance with more agile monsters, escaping a sticky situation, or lining up a strong aerial smash which softens up a wyvern for riding. Between this and the unique and flashy Silkbind attacks for each weapon, the Wirebug opens up loads of options for your character not just in combat, but exploration as well, where you can sling yourself into scenery and wall run to higher ground in search of rare materials and secrets.  It feels like a lot of what’s new in Monster Hunter Rise is to do with mobility. The aforementioned wyvern riding, which lets you mount a monster that’s been stunned with Wirebug attacks or through a turf war with another roaming beastie, is deceptively flexible - letting you charge nearly the full way across the map to square up to your target. Yes, it does feel like there’s a full three-second delay between pressing the attack button on the back of a monster and anything happening, but it just wouldn’t be Monster Hunter if you weren’t locked into a grand animation at some point. Then there are the new Palamute buddies - ninja dog friends to me and you - who you can saddle up and ride about whenever you’re in need of a speed boost.  
 
Beside being incredibly cute, with loads of adorably functional equipment sets for both your doggo and traditional palico cat helper to craft, your buddies are useful partners in battle. You can deck them out to be healers, distract monster aggro away from your hunter, or just focus on extra damage with behavior sets which actually feel like they make some difference. Between these three additions, Capcom has functionally solved the issue in previous games where you had to trudge around wide-open spaces from encounter-to-encounter or to farm materials, without any one thing feeling too overpowered. The story in Monster Hunter Rise is light, but the framing and characterisation of Kamura Village is one of my favorite things about the game. Where Astera in Monster Hunter World felt flat and empty despite its size, your home in Monster Hunter Rise feels emblematic of the game as a whole: condensed to include the series’ fundamentals with not a whole lot else. During the main story there aren’t any purpose-built set-pieces like when you fight Zora Magnaros in Monster Hunter World. In fact, every main mission you embark on is a standard hunt or Rampage. But again, this stripped back presentation isn’t much to the detriment of Rise. It feels like Capcom has conceded that you’re coming to Monster Hunter for deep and nuanced combat, not a deep and nuanced story, and focused on creating somewhere sweet and cosy to kick back between missions, rather than anything more character-led. This extends to the hunts themselves where the sedate tracking feature, where you'd have to collect clues pointing you towards a new wyvern's location, has also been shelved in favor of a simple map marker.   
 
A commonly accepted factor in Monster Hunter World’s breakout success in the West was accessibility, with a greater grounding in complex mechanics offered to new players from the start. Monster Hunter Rise feels like another step in this direction, with your journey towards rolling the game’s initial credits - past which there are several completely different monsters introduced - feeling noticeably easier than previous entries in the series. To continue comparisons to World, it doesn’t feel like there’s anything as tough as Anjanath in the Ancient Forest or Diablos in the Wildspire Waste through the whole of Monster Hunter Rise’s main story. This time around, the real big boys don’t come out to play until very close to the end. While not boring by any means, it does make for a stronger difficulty spike instead of hitting more consistent walls. It’s an interesting design choice that definitely settles you into the rhythm and familiarises you with the skill set of hunting more smoothly, but could feel like a grind for returning players looking to tax themselves from the off. However fans of Monster Hunter’s more impenetrable systems needn’t worry too much about any dumbing-down. Things like the inscrutable crafting system remain as bulletproof as ever - albeit with the ability to rollback unwanted upgrades to reclaim your spent materials. The wyverns in Monster Hunter Rise are brilliant. Each archetype feels so unique, so expressive and majestic that it feels utterly terrible to watch them gammily limp away in injured retreat or cry tears why you break one of their material parts.  There only feels like a couple of really obvious economic reuses of animations - a charge here, a paw-swipe there - but it does a lot to keep the same revisited areas fresh when you’re fighting multiple different monsters in a single mission. The environments themselves look less brilliant, and this is one of the places that you can tell you’re playing on a less powerful machine. Textures can look muddy and lack detail up close which is further lost at a distance.  
 
However, docked and handheld performance has remained solid throughout the entirety of the main story and beyond I’ve played. With that said, even on a stock Switch things in handheld mode look very, very small, and it’s tough to discern the subtle animation cues of monsters’ attack patterns and focus on the finer points that’re key to success in Monster Hunter. A traditional console experience suits the marquee fights more naturally, but the option to take farming runs or other expeditions into handheld mode does help Rise feel less grindy. Finally, the biggest new addition in Monster Hunter Rise is Rampage mode, where you defend the gates of Kamura Village from waved onslaughts of multiple monsters at a time. It plays out like a tower defence game, where you position auto-firing ballista turrets and cannons, along with special units and bombs, to slow the encroaching advance of big beast after big beast.I really didn’t like playing Rampage at first, where I felt like the protracted chunk of Monster Hunter animations meshed horribly with the frantic plate-spinning required to keep on top of the assault.  
 
For example, as I mentioned in the intro, getting poisoned by a Pukei-Pukei is an absolute disaster, since you have to spend an eternity putting away your weapon, cycling to an antidote, pressing to drink it, sniffing the cork of the bottle, writing flavor notes on the vintage, swirling it around in your palm to warm the aromas, before finally sitting down to drink it with a four-course meal. All the while your mates are getting battered by the kind of wyverns that target your installations, your defences are being mauled by the kind that monsters that break everything, and flying monsters just generally make a nuisance of themselves. Rampage has grown on me a lot as a good source of rewards and an alternative way to gather resources for many different types of monsters at once - especially as it’s a much easier and ironically less intense way of farming difficult monster types. Then there are the unique Defender Ticket rewards, which give powerful ‘Ramped Up’ buffs to literally every weapon in the game, so it’s well worth the distraction. Ultimately, Monster Hunter Rise is a solid, standalone entry to the series which pulls back on the scope of recent games on more powerful platforms, but doesn’t skimp on the fundamentals that made the Monster Hunter name. While it does feel like a smaller package in terms of grand story presentation, the new additions and quality-of-life fixes make it less grindy to play, with greater flexibility in exploration, navigation, and resource collection adding to the portable possibilities. With just five locales to house the vast roster of creatures though, it will be interesting to see whether Rise can have the same long-lasting appeal as its predecessors. More monsters have already been promised, with the first free post-launch drop slated for April 2021.

Monster Hunter Rise,Diego Perez,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/monster-hunter-rise-ps5-review/,"Storied developer Capcom has seen a huge resurgence these past few years, bringing its pillar franchises back into the limelight with strong entries that capitalize on their strengths. While Resident Evil is experiencing newfound success with its original entries and stellar remakes and Street Fighter hype is higher than ever before with the sixth mainline fighter on its way, none of Capcom’s franchises have blown up quite like Monster Hunter.Monster Hunter World was the first game that really captured the attention of western audiences, becoming Capcom’s best-selling game ever by a monster-sized margin. Monster Hunter Rise, the follow-up to World, ditched the consoles that made it popular in favor of the Nintendo Switch (and a PC port), leaving many fans unable to experience the new locales and monsters. Now that Monster Hunter Rise is finally coming to PlayStation and Xbox consoles, console-based hunters can finally find out why Monster Hunter Rise is the best game in the series firsthand.Monster Hunter Rise is an excellent game (but you knew that already if you read our initial Monster Hunter Rise review) and Capcom’s latest holds up wonderfully on other platforms. The latest port of Rise brings the game to PlayStation and Xbox consoles alongside its addition to Game Pass for players in Microsoft’s ecosystem. These new versions boast all of the improvements made in the game’s PC port (Hey! I reviewed that one too!), so that review applies here as well.Sadly, this version of Monster Hunter Rise lacks the excellent Sunbreak expansion, but it’s slated to release sometime this spring. While it’s disappointing to see the expansion missing at launch, especially since it seemed like Capcom’s staggered expansion release woes were remedied with the simultaneous release of Sunbreak on PC and Nintendo Switch, it’s thankfully not as bad as the differences between the PC and console versions of Monster Hunter World and its Iceborne expansion. In the meantime, you can check out all the fantastic content that you can look forward to in our review of Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak on Nintendo Switch.The core Monster Hunter formula is alive and well in Rise, but the technical wizardry of the RE Engine powering the game allowed Capcom to port over the quality of life systems added in World on top of new, exciting traversal methods. You’ll still choose a monster to hunt in the village, eat a hearty meal, and then set out into the wilderness to track your prey, but it’s what happens on the field that really sets Rise apart from its predecessors.Monster Hunter Rise is a masterful blend of old and new. It’s closer to the classic Monster Hunter games of the 3DS, but without any of the technical constraints. There are no loading screens separating each world, monsters can fight one another in the wild, you can move while drinking potions, and endemic life plays a huge part in a hunter’s success. All of these features debuted in World, so it’s nice to see them returning in a title that is still a Nintendo Switch game at its core.Traversal is the key addition in Rise, however. Your new canine Palamute companions can whisk you around the map at very high speeds, allowing you to keep up with a monster that decides to flee from battle. You can also climb or run along any wall in the game, giving Rise an unprecedented sense of verticality. Wirebugs are the most brilliant addition, however, acting as grappling hooks that can propel you forward or into the air. Your hunter is significantly more mobile in Rise, which opens up new possibilities for both slow and fast weapons alike. These Wirebugs can also be used for Silkbind attacks, special moves that add a new layer of strategy to combat. These serve a variety of purposes and can lead to monsters entering a weakened state where you can Wyvern Ride them. This is another new mechanic in Rise that lets you mount a monster and launch it into walls or attack other monsters nearby for a limited time. It’s a key part of hunts. You’ll do it pretty often, and it’s always as exciting as the first time.The genius of Rise’s new combat and traversal additions is that they can’t be used as a crutch. The slow, methodical combat of Monster Hunter still flows through Rise’s veins. An experienced hunter can use Wirebugs, Silkbind attacks, and swappable Switch Skills to demonstrate their expertise like never before, dancing around monsters and bullying them into submission. An inexperienced hunter will still flail around aimlessly without proper practice. Having more combat options is always a good thing, and Rise’s combat additions make it easier for new players to learn the ropes while also providing veterans with flashy new tools to play around with.Rise also learns several lessons from the environmental design of World, but it takes its locales to new heights with smart additions like Spiribirds. In Rise, simply eating a meal won’t bring your health and stamina to their maximum. Instead, you’ll need to collect Spiribirds around the map to slowly increase both meters. Spiribirds are placed throughout each environment like rings in a Sonic game, pairing beautifully with the new traversal systems and enticing you into taking new routes when pursuing monsters. Monsters also seem to flee way more often in Rise than in previous games, which is likely intentional to give players opportunities to collect Spiribirds and other endemic life throughout each region.Of course, fighting monsters is only half the fun in a Monster Hunter game. Despite what the village thinks, hunters are only taking these beasts down in order to make a nice new outfit, and in Monster Hunter Rise the scary new monster to shiny new hat pipeline is as addicting as ever. Weapon and armor designs are great, and you can even make use of layered armor to fine-tune your appearance and look your best on hunts. Fashion may be the true endgame, but it doesn’t make up for Rise’s actual endgame problems. The Sunbreak expansion is not currently available on PlayStation or Xbox consoles, so players will have to wait for the expanded postgame grind that PC and Switch players have access to right now. Monster Hunter Rise’s base endgame is easily its weakest aspect, and it’s frustrating to go back to that nearly two years after the game’s initial release. When Sunbreak launches, this won’t be an issue. As it currently stands though, it’s hard to recommend dumping dozens of additional hours into Rise after the credits roll.Still, Monster Hunter Rise is a stellar action RPG that feels right at home on its new platforms. With the game out on every major system now, it’ll hopefully get the same love and attention from fans as World did. Plus, next-gen console features like a 120 FPS mode really make the game shine in new ways. It’s sad that the Sunbreak expansion is being held back for a later release, but Monster Hunter Rise is still absolutely worth your time in its base form.This game was reviewed using a copy of the game provided by the game's publisher,public relations company, developer or other for the express purpose of a review.

Monster Hunter Rise,Mick Fraser,God is a Geek,https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/monster-hunter-rise-ps5-review/,"January 24, 2023Monster Hunter Rise was, at one time, one of the Switch’s best exclusives. Following many of the templates laid out by Monster Hunter World a few years before, Rise offered a vibrant, beautiful world full of colossal beasts to hunt alone or with friends – and a franchise that was up until then underrepresented on Nintendo’s newest console.The PC release last year broke the exclusivity, but no one really minded. The Monster Hunter community has its share of elites, but by and large the fans just want more people to experience these games and the PC port was a great way to do that. Even without the Sunbreak expansion, the PC version of Monster Hunter Rise felt massively superior in terms of performance. A faster framerate, lightning loadtimes, and a much sharper resolution made a big difference.Now Rise is coming to yet another platform (well, several) with the PS5 and Xbox editions, the former of which is the focus of this review. It looks and feels almost identical to the PC port, with stunning 60fps action and quick loadtimes to get you into the hunt even faster. Sadly, it doesn’t come complete with the Sunbreak expansion (which will follow later) – but it does have all the quality of life improvements that accompanied Sunbreak on the other platforms.So, for those uninitiated, you play the role of the hero of Kamura, a small village threatened by the Rampage, a frenzied gathering of the local megafauna inesponse to the arrival of some incredibly powerful ancient monsters. It’s your job to go out and research (*annihilate) any monster that poses a threat (**stands around minding its own business) for the safety of Kamura (***a new pair of monster-skin pants).One of Rise’s major selling points is its verticality. World may have been a vast new adventure, but it mostly took place on a single plane. Rise isn’t afraid to go upwards, sending you to the tops of towering hills and leading you through clifftop forests. A rich collection of environments soon become super easy to navigate thanks to fast-travel points, even as the fights themselves become a little easier as you gain experience and improve your gear.Monster Hunter Rise, like the rest of the franchise, is a very skill-dependent game. While you will improve your weapons and armour, and can unlock special skills attached to whatever you’re wearing, it’s your own skill and ability to read each monster that will ultimately make you a better Hunter.There are fourteen weapon archetypes, each with vastly different movesets, and picking the right one for you is a daunting challenge for a newcomer. For its part, Rise does ease you in fairly slowly, asking you to kill a few easy small monsters at first, and introducing you to things like item crafting and silkbind skills as you go.To aid movement and add special moves to each weapon you’ll learn to utilise Wirebugs, magical critters that allow you to swing from them and bind monsters in their silk. This essentially allows for multiple devastating moves per weapon that often add buffs to you and debuffs to the monster. The Wirebug also allows you to stagger monsters and ride them, using them to attack other monsters in the area for heavy damage and more loot.While you can choose to hunt alone, most of the time you’ll set out alongside two buddies. Your Palico is a smart feline companion who will fight alongside you and buff you, while your Palamute is a large hound that you can ride around on and will come to your aid in a fight. Both are custom created by the player, and you even name them and outfit them with their own armour and weapons.Although the entire game is doable as a solo player, it’s often more fun to team up with friends or strangers in the Gathering Hub and take on tougher multiplayer quests. You will have to share the money earned for each hunt, but that’s really the only downside.One thing the PS5 version in particular brings to Rise is the DualSense 5’s haptic feedback. While it’s not as strong in some games, it does add to the overall experience. You’ll find it most noticable as a Bow, Bowgun, or Gunlance user, as the adaptive triggers react to your ammo situation. But any weapon class benefits, as you feel the rumble of combat or the buzz of a charge attack through your palms. It’s hard to really criticise this version of Monster Hunter Rise other than to say it’s a shame we have to wait for the Sunbreak expansion. While there are great monsters to hunt in the base game, the endgame portion is vastly inferior to Sunbreak, seeing you head into Rampage missions over and over to combine traditional hunting with tiresome tower defence mechanics. It’s quite a spectacle the first few times, but once it’s all you have to earn the rarer materials and skills, it becomes a little boring.That said, the Sunbreak content is definitely heading our way soon, and so we can’t complain too much. Monster Hunter Rise on PS5 is still a fantastic experience – especially for newcomers or fans of World who, until now, have been unable to get stuck into Rise. Whether it’s the best Monster Hunter to date is a subject of fierce debate, but either way it’s still a fantastic entry to the series and a solid jumping-off point for new players.Looks great

Monster Hunter Rise,Diego Perez,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/monster-hunter-rise-pc-review/,"Monster Hunter on PC feels like a match made in heaven, but the series has surprisingly only seen two mainline entries on Steam. The first of which was the belated port of Monster Hunter World, which arrived a few months after the PS4 and Xbox One versions and always felt like it took a backseat to its console counterparts when it came to post-launch support and updates. Now, Monster Hunter Rise is the second Monster Hunter game to hit PC, and it feels like Capcom has finally realized the massive potential the franchise has on the platform.As expected, the PC port of Rise is miles better than the Nintendo Switch version. Both versions are functionally identical, but a higher framerate and resolution really do make that much of a difference. Rise is much faster-paced than its predecessors, largely due to new additions like the Wirebug and Switch Skills that add an entirely new layer of mobility during combat. Because of its action-oriented nature, being able to play at 60 FPS or higher just feels right. It’s easy to nail those last-second dodges, and hitting shots with ranged weapons like the Bowgun feels a whole lot easier.Rise also shows that a PC version of Monster Hunter doesn’t need the fancy graphics of World. The core experience is satisfying enough, and it really feels like there were zero gameplay concessions made because this was originally a Nintendo Switch game. This is an uncompromised Monster Hunter experience that only feels held back in the visual department, although it’s not much of an issue because the game does still look very good at high resolutions thanks to its strong art direction. Rise already looked surprisingly good on Switch, and that style scales up very well on PC.All of these technical improvements are to be expected when it comes to a PC port, but that’s the main reason people would be interested in the PC version of Rise over the Switch port anyway. You lose out on portability (at least until the Steam Deck releases later this year), but you gain a sharper resolution, higher framerate, ultrawide support, faster load times, and all the bells and whistles you’d expect.Moving past the PC-specific enhancements, Monster Hunter Rise is still an exceptional game on its own. The franchise has gotten better and better with each entry, but most would agree that Monster Hunter World was the largest jump the series has made in a long time. It made Monster Hunter more accessible than ever before with a streamlined upgrade system, open-world maps, and a stronger focus on environments, and all of those features have thankfully remained in Rise.Of course, the environments are a lot less detailed in Rise than they were in World due to the game’s origins on Switch, but that open design philosophy has remained present. Environments are packed with endemic life that can be used in various ways while on hunts, and glowing Spiribirds are scattered throughout levels that provide stat buffs when collected. Loading screens between areas are thankfully still gone, and environments have an unprecedented level of verticality that players can take advantage of using the game’s new mobility options.Wirebugs and Palamutes seem like a small addition on paper, but in practice, they completely change the way you play the game. Palamutes can be mounted so you can get around areas faster, and they can drift around corners to gain a speed boost. When a monster flees, you can usually keep up with it while mounted, which gets rid of a lot of the downtime that used to be present during hunts. You can still take your time to sharpen, heal, or return to camp to grab ammo if need be, but that downtime is now basically optional.Wirebugs, on the other hand, can be used while on foot and have a variety of uses. The main use is essentially a grappling hook that can be used anywhere at any time. You can pull yourself in any direction, even upward, and you can run up and along walls if you launch yourself into them. If you use the Wirebug to land aerial attacks on a monster, then you’ll make it more susceptible to being mounted. Wyvern Riding replaces traditional mounting, allowing you to hop on a monster’s back and slam it into walls or use it to attack other nearby monsters. Outside of movement, Wirebugs can also be spent to unleash powerful special abilities called Silkbind attacks.All of these new additions make Rise the most fluid Monster Hunter game to date. The game’s combat still maintains the heavy, deliberate feeling that the series is known for though, so don’t expect to be able to swing your weapon around without much thought and still make it through high-rank hunts. However, most of the weapons lack the oomph that they had in World. Weapons felt much more impactful in that game than they do in Rise. It’s not that weapons feel bad in Rise, they actually feel similar to weapons from previous 3DS Monster Hunter games, it’s just that World was such an upgrade in the audiovisual department that Rise’s weapon feedback feels like a step back.That’s a very minor gripe though, and there’s a lot to love about everything else in Rise. Even the new Rampage mode, which is basically a tower defense minigame where you place ballistas, cannons, and automated defenses to ward off waves of monsters, is surprisingly enjoyable, especially with friends. It’s not compelling enough to replace the traditional hunts, but as a side mode, it’s a nice addition. It also gives special rewards that can be used to improve your weapons, which any serious hunter will want to take advantage of.All in all, Rise is a standout entry in a series that already features a long line of excellent titles. Monster Hunter Rise combines all of the quality of life features introduced in World while keeping the best parts of the earlier games in the series, resulting in the most refined Monster Hunter title to date. There are a few improvements that could be made, mostly regarding the endgame loop, but those issues are all but guaranteed to be remedied with the release of the Sunbreak expansion later this year. Everything we said about Monster Hunter Rise in our original Nintendo Switch review still stands, and the PC version is even better.This game was reviewed using a copy of the game provided by the game's publisher,public relations company, developer or other for the express purpose of a review.
Attack of the Fanboy / GAME REVIEWS / Monster Hunter Rise PC Review"
Monster Hunter Rise,Dean James,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/monster-hunter-rise-review/,"The Monster Hunter series had very humble beginnings as merely a niche series that started to gain a foothold in the handheld market before truly exploding with Monster Hunter World in 2018. When that game released, Nintendo Switch owners were hoping to get their own port, but instead all they got was an upgraded port of a 3DS game with Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate. Capcom was still very interested in bringing a more modern Monster Hunter experience to the Nintendo Switch though, which finally has come to fruition with the release of Monster Hunter Rise.For anyone that is new to the Monster Hunter franchise, the core gameplay for the series is literally what the title would lead you to think it is. That is exactly the case in Monster Hunter Rise, where you create your own Hunter character and can go on quests to slay various monsters. However, there is much more to it than that, as there is a lot of depth to the game in a number of different ways that will keep you coming back for more again and again.Across most of the franchise, Monster Hunter area maps were segmented into separate zones that had load screens between both, but Monster Hunter World changed that dramatically by opening up each area. Monster Hunter Rise takes a similar approach, by having each map in the game be one area that you can explore to your heart’s content without any sign of a loading screen. Like with World, this makes the chasing after of monsters when they run away from you leagues better than it was before, as you feel like you are actually on their trail.Exploration takes a step forward in Monster Hunter Rise thanks to the addition of what is known as the Wirebug. The Wirebug has multiple uses in the game, including both in exploring the map and in battle. At the beginning of each quest, you start with two Wirebugs, which can be activated with the press of a button. Monster Hunter Rise adds a sense of scale to the game to a level that has not seen before, with you able to use the Wirebug to grab onto cliffs and climb up them if there are no vines nearby, as well as wall run.The Wirebug can even be used out in the open to move from one spot to the next more quickly, which can be useful to dodge an enemy attack. When you are hit by an attack and sent flying, you can also use a Wirebug to execute a Wirefall to quickly rebound. Each of the weapons also have what are known as Silkbind attacks related to the Wirebug as well, but you are limited to how many you have. The good news is that they will replenish after a short cooldown, along with you being able to find extra ones around the map as well.Monster Hunter Rise also introduces another major feature that serves as yet another quality of life improvement for the series, the Palamute. Palicoes were added to the series prior as cat companions that you could use to help you in battle and now you have your own dog companion as well. While Palamutes can be designed just like Palicoes and are able to help you in battle, they take it one step further by letting you ride your Palamute everywhere. This not only saves time when traveling around the map yourself, but is a lifesaver when chasing after runaway monsters.Monster Hunter Rise offers players 14 different weapons types to choose from, including the Great Sword, Dual Blades, Bow, and many more. While this is the exact same lineup offered in Monster Hunter World, these weapons offer a great variety of different options. You have more simple weapons like the Dual Blades that are great for newcomers, while also having much more intricate movesets with weapons like the Charge Blade or Insect Glaive. This allows players to tailor the game to their level of experience and how comfortable they are with branching out. Like in the past, you can hone in on one specific weapon and work towards mastering it or you can switch it up and try them all.Not only do you have access to the different weapon types, but there are also numerous variations of each weapon that you can forge or upgrade at the Blacksmith. This will require you to find the right supplies and reach certain points of the game to where you have access to higher level versions of the weapons. One really helpful feature is that you can rollback your builds to retain the parts used in them to then go for another path with that same weapon.Monster Hunter Rise has its own distinct structure when it comes to quests, which are what the game itself revolves around. Like most Monster Hunter games, there isn’t much of a story here other than you needing to go out and hunt monsters for people in the village or protecting the village itself from larger scale attacks. The quests are given by different NPCs located around the village of Kamura, including the Village Quests given by Hinoa the Quest Maiden. These are essentially the equivalent of story missions for the game, which are ranked in difficulty from Level 1 to Level 5.Each level has a list of Key Quests that must be completed to move the game forward, while there are also some extra missions mixed in that can just be done for reward money and materials. One of the most daunting elements of previous Monster Hunter games has been the steep learning curve and early difficulty, but Monster Hunter Rise feels a bit different here. The early quests are much more manageable and allow new players to get acclimated before upping the difficulty too much, which is a major shift from past entries and makes the game much more accessible. After completing each tier of Key Village Quests, you will unlock what is known as an Urgent Quest. These are not really anything too special from the regular quests, but they must be completed to unlock the next level of Village Quests.While completing these, there are also Optional Subquests available of which you can only select up to five at at time. These task you with things such as gathering a certain number of plants or slaying a certain number of small monsters. By completing these, you will get very useful items, including Kamura Points and often Armor Spheres, the latter of which will allow you to upgrade your armor at the Blacksmith. Talking to villagers in Kamura will also unlock special Requests that you can complete for them through the Village Quests menu.Eventually, you will face what is known as a Rampage Quest, which is brand new to the franchise in Monster Hunter Rise. Rampage Quests are wave-based battles where you have to defend Kamura Village from hordes of monsters. You are not alone here though, as this adds in a tower defense mechanic into the mix where you can place offensive and defensive installations around the area to help fend them off. The defensive installations will be manned automatically, but the offensive ones you can use yourself to take out the monsters. There are also some traps you can lay or utilize to try and take them down more easily.Netcode works near seamlesslyThese hordes are made up of easy to defeat monsters, which are then followed by a leader that will take awhile to take down. You can go and fight them head on as well as per usual, but the safer router is definitely to take advantage of the installations. Your goal is to defend the gates and prevent them from making it into the village by breaking through every gate in the area. After the initial Rampage Quest that is part of the story, you can access them at anytime to do more of them. These are distinctly different from the rest of the quests in the game, so it was a great decision to add something like this to keep the game fresh.Similar to the Village Quests are the Hub Gathering Quests, which are given elsewhere in the game. These are much more difficult than the Village Quests, which can even be taken on with up to three other Hunters online. Arena quests can also be done with one other person, which pit you with a monster within an arena, though you are given specific equipment to use each time. Monster Hunter World made the online element of the game such an integral part and these quests are what will keep Monster Hunter Rise going for years thanks to the online mechanic.  Mixing online play and Nintendo Switch is often a recipe for disaster, but the netcode works near seamlessly awhile traversing the maps and in battle.Online isn’t the only area that Nintendo Switch has struggled at times in the past either, as performance is often a question mark with certain games. The good news here though is that Monster Hunter Rise runs very well both in docked and in handheld mode, with the battles being very fluid. A game like Monster Hunter Rise really needs absolute precision when it comes to combat, so having it run smoothly was very important. The game certainly isn’t among the best on the Switch in visuals, but the environments are very well designed and add a lot to the overall experience.Monster Hunter has been growing in popularity and the release of Monster Hunter Rise should help to take that to the next level. Rather than a hampered port of Monster Hunter World, this game is its own full scale game from beginning to end. Making the game a little easier at the beginning was a great choice to help newer players get their feet wet before throwing everything that makes the series so great at them. Adding in the new game mechanics of the Wirebug and Palamute takes things to the next level and make Monster Hunter Rise yet another must own game for the Nintendo Switch.Monster Hunter Rise takes the best elements from the series and mixes them with a few new mechanics to give players a fresh experience that is the most accessible in the franchise to date.
Attack of the Fanboy / GAME REVIEWS / Monster Hunter Rise Review"
Monster Hunter Rise,Mick Fraser,God is a Geek,https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/monster-hunter-rise-review/,"March 26, 2021For many people, 2018’s Monster Hunter World was an entry into a franchise that had already been going for a dozen years across various systems. A series often whispered about by the hardcore gamers out there who could stand up to its stern challenge and rigid traditions. World broke it open for a lot of people, myself included, allowing us in with wide arms and presenting a massively feature-rich adventure to get stuck into.After seeing it ported to PC with the release of the Iceborne expansion, World fans began to wonder if we might see it on the Switch one day, albeit with some serious technical concessions. But Capcom were already busy brewing the successor in Monster Hunter Rise, the second Monster Hunter game to grace the switch (after Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate), but the first made specifically to run on Nintendo’s hybrid console.Doubters can rest easy, though: from what I’ve seen so far (aside the demo we haven’t been able to play online yet) the frame rate and performance holds steady, even when there are multiple monsters and NPCs on-screen at once. It’s not a graphical powerhouse (although it looks lovely in handheld mode), but it is a technical marvel. Even the loading times are short and snappy, meaning you’re in and out of the action that much quicker.In fact, the pacing has been upped considerably throughout. Gathering materials in the wild is faster; smaller, more condensed maps get you to the action quicker, and there’s just less messing around in general. Even inexperienced players will rattle through the Low Rank content pretty quickly because it takes a while for Rise to start throwing walls at you. And by the time it does, you should have a fairly firm grasp of what you’re doing.The story focuses on the village of Kamura, a quaint little spot in the middle of nowhere which, every fifty years, is threatened by the Rampage, a mysterious natural event that sees all the larger and more ferocious monsters converge on the village. Their only option is to fight back – which is where you come in. Whereas World sets you up as a green recruit who must be moulded into a badass, Rise forgets the set-up and immediately introducers you as a Hunter sent to aid Kamura. You’ve got growing to do, for sure, but Rise very much treats you like you’ve played the series before.It still starts you off slowly, giving you a choice of running solo Village Quests or multiplayer-enabled Hub Quests, but it’s clear which is the intended path. Village Quests advance the story and are generally easier, so it’s best to start there, feeling your way through the initial few until you find your feet. Newcomers will find this early part super helpful, while veterans will be thankful it doesn’t outstay its welcome.Before long though you’ll be tackling quests to hunt and kill or capture large monsters, and it’s during this stage that you’ll get to grips with the new village hub and its many, many NPC denizens. Capcom have done a lot of work with the Hub, too, attempting to make it as accessible as possible while still spreading it out like a proper settlement. You can find everything there, from smiths to upgrade and forge weapons and armour to quest-givers, the Canteen, various vendors and access to other areas such as the multiplayer Gathering Hub and the Buddy Plaza. It’s a big place, but it’s beautiful, inspired by Japanese culture (as indeed is the gorgeous music and many of the monsters and armour sets) and full of vibrancy.Palicoes return from previous instalments to help you on your hunts, but now you’re also joined by a Palamute, a canine companion who will fight beside you as well as carry you from place to place. After you create your hunter, you’ll be able to create a Palico and Palamute to be your permanent companions through the game. Once you start youi can visit the Buddy Plaza and swap them around if you want to, taking two Palamutes or two Palicoes out on each quest. It’s easy to get attached to your buddies, so it’s a good thing you can craft armour and weapons for them, too.Skill systems seen in Monster Hunter World have been tweaked rather than completely overhauled, and Capcom have incorporated elements from the earlier games. In World for example, you could craft charms for permanent buffs but had to grind for Decorations to enhance or imbue certain skills on your gear. It relied heavily on RNG and meant many people struggled to get the build they wanted because they could never get a particular rare Decoration to drop. In Rise this is swapped over, so that charms are found and Decorations can be crafted, meaning you have more chance of developing that build you saw your squad-mate using.The controversial Clutch Claw is also gone – so no more softening monster hides over and over during a hunt. Instead you have the Wirebug, a tricky little insect that lets you swing across gaps, propel yourself into the air or, crucially, bind monsters to be temporarily ridden. Wyvern Riding is one of Rise’s biggest new additions, and it’s almost as satisfying as wall-banging monster heads was in World. Now, if you wear a monster down enough and hit them with a “Silkbind” move assigned to your weapon, you can truss them and ride them, attacking other monsters or just, well, wall-banging their heads until they fall over. It’s a fun new tactic, but I miss World’s mounting mechanic a little. The Wirebug also allows for much more verticality, and the tighter maps compensate for their smaller area by being much more vertical than ever before. You can now run up walls and climb to dizzying heights to seek out secrets and rare endemic life to aid you in your quests.Perhaps the biggest addition to Rise is the Rampage itself. Rather than just a fancy word to give some context to hunting beautiful and intelligent creatures to near extinction, the Rampage is an event in which you can very much take part. Periodically (and later, optionally), you’ll be called upon to defend Kamura from hordes of rampaging Wyvern. In these moments you’ll need to lay down defences such as Ballistae, explosive traps and cannons to repel the hordes and keep them from destroying the village. You’ll get multiple waves of a variety of monsters, and will need to utilise the defences you’ve set as well as your skills as a Hunter to beat them back. You can even call on NPCs from the village to help you.The Rampage Quests are great fun. They feel like the very best of World’s Siege events, only with fewer complications, and all the spectacle and noise you’d expect from fighting two or three large monsters at once. While we haven’t tried it with other players yet, it’s an almost guaranteed hoot trying to coordinate around multiple monsters and hunters until the Alpha comes, the big monster leading the horde, who must be dealt with to end the Rampage.There are over 30 large monsters to hunt in Monster Hunter Rise, with more already promised, and it’s a diverse, colourful bunch. And the locales in which you’ll hunt them are well thought-out, cramming a lot of landmarks and areas into comparatively small maps. The Lava Caverns for example, have an upper area under the sky, with dark caves beneath fractured by rivers of molten stone. Where possible, the vistas are designed to astound you and, while the Switch lacks the graphical power of large consoles, it still manages to look pretty incredible at times.There’s so much to talk about in Rise that I feel I could go on and on. New vendors and systems, new armour sets, weapons. There’s the Petalace, which determines the effects of the Spiribirds you’ll locate in the wild for buffs to health, stamina, damage and defence, or the Buddy Dojo where you can send your companions to train while you run Quests with substitutes for a bit. It feels like Capcom have thought of everything, and if I have any complaint at all it’s that the story doesn’t conclude in Rise – we have to wait for the free title update a month after release for that. Which here doesn’t feel like a major blow. The update will be free, and there’s already tens or hundreds of hours of hunting and crafting and grinding and building to be done before you have to worry about that. Currently it’s missing a strong endgame like World’s Guiding Lands which, again, is likely to be addressed and hopefully soon.But it feels churlish to complain about wanting more when I’ve still got armour sets to build, quests to finish, gear to craft and monsters to hunt. Monster Hunter Rise is a huge, rich game, filled with things to see and challenges to overcome, which manages to feel incredibly accessible to newcomers while still catering to the veterans. It’s a superb entry to the Switch’s bustling library, but more than that, it’s a stunning example of a game created by a dev team that know exactly what they’re doing.The most accessible Monster Hunter yet

Monster Hunter Rise,Mike Minotti,GamesBeat,https://venturebeat.com/2021/03/23/monster-hunter-rise-review-switch-rises-to-the-occasion/,"Connect with top gaming leaders in Los Angeles at GamesBeat Summit 2023 this May 22-23. Register here.I’m not the biggest Monster Hunter fan in the world … although, ironically, I did enjoy Monster Hunter World. Something about the boost in presentation and graphics made it more appealing to me. I was worried that a Switch version of Monster Hunter would be disappointing.Much to my surprise, I like Monster Hunter Rise for Switch even more than World. This newest iteration in Capcom’s cooperative action-RPG series comes out March 26. The Switch does have a port of a 3DS Monster Hunter with Generations Ultimate, but Rise is the first game in this series made specifically with Nintendo’s hit console in mind.Although the Switch is underpowered compared to Monster Hunter World’s platforms (PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC), Capcom has been able to make a game that still looks nice. It also has some gameplay enhancements that’s going to make it hard for me to go back to the series’ older games.Out of all the new features, the Palamute is the best. In previous Monster Hunter games, you have cat companions named Palico that can join your hunts. The wolf-like Palamute helps further by attacking your targets, but you can also get on its back and ride it.GamesBeat Summit 2023Join the GamesBeat community in Los Angeles this May 22-23. You’ll hear from the brightest minds within the gaming industry to share their updates on the latest developments.This makes getting around Rise’s large maps a lot more fun. The Palamute can even scale some walls and drift around tight corners. You can also use items while riding, so you can sharpen your sword or swig a potion while pursuing a fleeing monster. You can also attack while you’re on your Palamute if you’re looking to get some quick damage in.The Palamute helps make playing Rise fun even if you’re aren’t with friends. Having both a Palamute and a Palico makes you feel like you have a full squad, even if you don’t have any other human players with you. And unlike the Palico, you can actually take your Palamute with you during co-op hunts.Above: Sadly, my real dog is much too small to ride.The wirebug is the other big addition. This is essentially a grapple hook, and it’s a versatile tool.It helps a lot with getting around, as you can use the wirebug to help you scale up cliffs. You can also use it on defense. It can fling you out of harm’s way if a monster is charging toward you. Offensively, the wirebug can help you launch yourself into the air to attack your target from above. It also unlocks a few special attacks for each weapon.Movement in Monster Hunter games has always been slow and methodical. The wirebug speeds thing up just enough so that fights feel a bit more fair and less frustrating.I love Monster Hunter World’s hub town, but it’s a bit too sprawling for its own good. Rise has a more condensed staging area, which makes it easier to do your shopping, upgrading, and eating before you hunts. It also looks lovely. While World has an age of exploration fantasy vibe, Rise takes its visual cues from Japanese history, with torii gates and shrines dotting the hub town of Kamura Village.Although the levels you hunt monsters in are a bit less exciting to look at (they follow the typical themes of a forest stage, an ice stage, a fire stage, and so on), they still look good … for a Switch game. Yes, that sounds like an underhanded compliment. But you may be spoiled by World’s beautiful levels, with their fancy lighting effects and dense foliage. Rise’s hunting grounds get the job done, even if they aren’t as detailed. And if the levels themselves don’t wow, the monsters still look great thanks to some superb animations.Above: Kamura Village is a pleasant place for prepping.Rampage is an addition I’m not as enthused about. This is a kind of tower defense mode. Monsters try to break through walls and enter your town, and you have to set up turrets and other obstacles to slow them down. Or you can just go fight them directly.It’s fine. Honestly, I’ve never been a big tower defense fan anyway. And for Monster Hunter, I’d rather just go fight monsters directly then set up traps or plant turrets. It’s not an bad game mode, but it’s one that doesn’t interest me.You know what I do like about Rise? The pacing.Monster Hunter World has such a slow start. It spends too much time setting up its story and easing you into game. Rise has a much faster start. It doesn’t have the same emphasis on narrative, which is just fine with me.Instead, Rise is all about hunting monsters. Which, you know, seems appropriate for a franchise named Monster Hunter. Capcom has done a great job bringing this series to Switch, and new features like the Palamute and wirebug make this a more fast-paced experience.Rise is great by yourself (with the help of your Palico and Palamute) or with online hunters. Capcom did have its servers active for a portion of the review period. Joining someone’s game was easy, and I was surprised by how smooth the online experience felt. When it comes to Switch, my expectations are always low when it comes to online capabilities, but Capcom seems to have it figured out. Of course, we’ll see just how stable things are once the game launches and many more players flood those servers.Honestly, I’d be just fine playing Rise by myself. The core gameplay loop of hunting monsters so you can make stronger equipment in order to hunt more monsters is captivating, and Rise has put that formula into a package that works great on Switch.Monster Hunter Rise comes out for Nintendo Switch on March 26.

Genre: Action/RPGMonster Hunter Rise came out in 2021 for the Nintendo Switch, and critics and gamers alike generally enjoyed it. Less than a year later, Capcom’s beast-slaying hit arrives on PC via Steam (opens in new tab). Though it has the usual upgrades and updates expected of a PC port, Monster Hunter Rise is very much the same engaging game it was on Nintendo’s handheld hybrid. As such, it is one of the best PC games you can buy right now.I was a huge fan of Monster Hunter World on PS4, so I have been anticipating this title since it originally came out. Yes, I could have tried it last year. But after playing Monster Hunter World and a healthy dose of PS5 games, I couldn’t play a game that ran on the Switch’s weaker hardware. The wait was worth it, because Monster Hunter Rise truly comes to life on PC. Sure, it’s not Monster Hunter World 2 (the game I really want), but it gives me enough to chew on until that game eventually comes out.For this Monster Hunter Rise review, I’ll give you an overview of the game and what I think of it compared to Monster Hunter World. However, I'll refrain from getting deep in the weeds, since this is a port of an older title. The long and short of it is that Monster Hunter Rise is a heck of a lot of fun, and a game I highly recommend to folks who want to see what Capcom’s popular franchise is all about.Monster Hunter games aren’t known for telling captivating stories, and Rise is no different. Your player-created character is a hunter based out of Kamura village, the game’s central hub area. Hordes of monsters are descending on Kamura because of a phenomenon known as the “Rampage.” As a new hunter, you must defend the village from incursions and figure out how to end the Rampage at its source. That’s about as deep as the narrative gets. This isn’t a bad thing, since you’re not here for a gripping tale. You’re here for some sweet monster-hunting action. And in that, this game excels.Monster Hunter Rise has the same core gameplay loop as its predecessors. You hunt down monsters in order to craft better armor, so that you can take on more powerful beasts. Rinse and repeat. That sounds trite, but the way that hunts play out is what keeps them from ever becoming boring. No two monsters behave the same way, and their ever-changing patterns and reactions during battles serve to keep you on your proverbial toes. Monsters become more aggressive and employ new tactics when you team up with a group of player-controlled hunters, making hunts even more thrilling and dangerous. Grinding for parts and materials is actually enjoyable in this game.Hunts play out much faster than in Monster Hunter World or other previous installments. One of the main reasons why is that you get to traverse the environment while riding on a large dog called a Palamute. Your furry pal brings you directly to a monster’s location (conveniently shown in the UI’s mini-map), and even fights alongside you. When a monster runs away, you can simply hop on your trusty canine steed and give chase.  Monster Hunter World introduced rideable mini-monsters in its Iceborne expansion, so it’s great to see that feature appear in Rise from the beginning.Another great addition is the Wirebug mechanic. This grappling hook serves many functions, both in and out of combat. As an exploration tool, you can use Wirebugs to reach what would otherwise be inaccessible areas. These often contain useful items used for crafting gear and hunting tools. Precise use of the Wirebug can have you darting around stages like a superhero. During combat, the Wirebug allows you to land on your feet if a monster swats you away, or lets you get to safety if you’re overwhelmed. You can also use the hook to get to a more advantageous position to set up an attack.Ensnaring monsters with the Wirebug is my favorite use of the tool. After knocking a monster off its feet, you can tie it to the ground and land free hits. You can also hop on the backs of trapped beasts and ride them head-first into natural and man-made structures to deal huge damage. If the monster you’re hunting knocks over another monster, you can use the felled creature to attack your prey. Controlling a monster like a puppet is more fun than it should be.The aforementioned Rampage introduces a tower defense-style mini-game during the course of the story. You have to defend and fortify the walls of Kamura against continuous waves of beasts. There are ballistae and other automated missile launchers that keep monsters back. You can commandeer one of these weapons and shoot encroaching beasties, which is actually quite fun. If the need arises, you’re free to fight monsters directly, as you would during a hunt. You can also participate in Rampages outside of the story, and use earned items to upgrade your defenses and purchase powerful weapons. Though some Rampages last longer than they should, they serve as a pleasant diversion from the standard monster hunts.Monster Hunter World incorporated its multiplayer component into the main narrative. By contrast, Rise has separate modes for single-player and multiplayer, as did the older Monster Hunters. I’m not a fan of this approach, as playing the entire story with friends (or even random players) was one of Monster Hunter World’s most appealing aspects. Yes, making friends wait for you to finish watching a cutscene before they could join was frustrating, but it was a small price to pay. Thankfully, all items earned in Rise's multiplayer are available to use in single-player. Still, I’m bummed that I have to play the entire story by myself.If you sank hundreds of hours into the Switch version of Monster Hunter Rise, you’ll be disappointed to know that you cannot carry your save file over to the PC port. I didn’t play the original Rise beyond its demo, so starting the game from the beginning wasn’t an issue for me. But I sympathize with Switch players who have to start over from scratch. I faced a similar situation when playing Monster Hunter World on PC after spending so much time on the PS4 version. Cross-saves would have been a great feature, either way.I can’t say that Monster Hunter Rise is one of the best-looking games out there. It’s certainly not ugly. But it’s clear that, underneath the 4K textures and post-processing effects, you’re playing a game originally developed to run on a less powerful platform (the Switch, in this case). The environments, though vast, are mostly empty and featureless, while the main human village feels tiny and constrained. A smaller village makes it easy to visit the various vendors lining the street, but it does contribute to Rise’s overall lack of scope. The game doesn't feel as expansive as Monster Hunter World.With that said, Monter Hunter Rise on PC is graphically superior to its Switch counterpart. While Rise looked good for a Switch game, the PC version improves the overall visual presentation with features that include HDR support, unlocked frame rates, as well as adjustable options such as anti-aliasing, ambient occlusion, texture filtering and more. All of these serve to make the stylized graphics look better than ever.The game's music complements its Japanese-inspired aesthetic. The soundtrack makes liberal use of classical Japanese instruments (or rather, excellent samples) to bring the score to life. The themes, heard during monster hunts, balance the aforementioned classical sounds with a more cinematic Western score, creating an interesting soundscape. While the soundtrack isn’t as robust as that of Monster Hunter World, it’s still catchy in its own way.If you’re new to the series, Monster Hunter Rise is an excellent jumping-on point that deftly teaches you the game’s admittedly complex mechanics. Fans of Monster Hunter World may not find this title as ambitious, but they’ll love features like the Wirebug and the overall faster pace of hunts. This game should also tide them over until Capcom announces Monster Hunter World 2. Switch players may want to opt out of this port, since they cannot transfer their existing saves.Shortcomings aside, Monster Hunter Rise shines on PC thanks to updated graphics and higher frame rates. That it contains all previously released post-launch content is also a boon, considering how sparse the Switch version felt at launch. But when you strip away all the PC bonuses, it’s simply an addictive title, featuring a ton of customization and some of the wildest combat found in a video game. The fact that I’m eager to end this review so I can go back to playing it tells you all you need to know.

Monster Hunter Rise,Katharine Castle,"Rock, Paper, Shotgun",https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-rise-pc-review,"Fang-tasticAfter the roaring success of Monster Hunter: World back in 2018, the idea that the next big PC entry in Capcom's dino pants craft 'em up is a game that originally started life on the Nintendo Switch is bound to ruffle a few feathers. But far from being a step down from World, Monster Hunter Rise is every bit its equal - and Capcom's stellar work with this PC port has given it a much-needed buff and polish to really make it shine. Not only does Rise offer the same seamless and expansive environments as World, but it also adds a few new twists to make tracking down its titular titans even more enjoyable. The first of these twists is the wirebug, a giant, luminous firefly-cum-grapple hook that lets hunters launch themselves skyward, recover from brutish pratfalls, and put reins on stunned beasties so you can briefly ride them rodeo-style to dole out some mega hit points. It's a highly versatile piece of equipment, giving rise (sorry) to not just the game's moniker, but also what elevates it from the rest of the series. Away from battle, the wirebugs turn Monster Hunter Rise's maps into veritable playgrounds, letting you clamber up sheer cliff faces that previously would have been nothing more than empty set dressing. Helpful trails of stat-buffing Spiribirds are on hand to guide your eye toward certain resource-rich locations tucked away from the main path, but following your nose to your own discoveries is all part of the fun. Sure, you're curtailed by your stamina bar and the number of wirebugs currently at your disposal, but overall these little beetles bring a welcome sense of openness to Rise that even World's enormous biomes sometimes struggled to convey. Indeed, climbing to the highest peak and spotting your quarry having a wash in the stream down below on the far side of the map (thanks, increased draw distances) is a thrill that never gets old. Neither does whipping them out for a quick recovery swing when you're really in the thick of it. I'm not gonna lie. As someone who often gets a big too carried away swinging her Dual Blades around in the heat of battle, I've probably spent as much time being knocked flat on my arse as I have standing upright. As long as you've got a fresh wirebug to hand, though, a quick squeeze of the left trigger and a tap of A will now yoink you to safety rather than break the flow of battle as you nurse your bruised glutes (I should also note that while keyboard controls are serviceable here, using a controller is definitely recommended). This isn't merely about saving face. Picking yourself back up after a proper walloping always felt a little jarring in previous Monster Hunter games, but breaking your fall with a cheeky wirebug helps keep the momentum going and gets you back into the fight faster. They're also just great fun for hurling yourself at enemies like an anime super warrior. Like previous entries, dealing damage while airborne brings you closer to being able to mount monsters for extra damage - a concept first introduced in Monster Hunter 4 with the pole-vault-style Insect Glaive, and later expanded in World to give all weapon classes a taste of the action. Rise, however, really goes to town with it, adding a raucous rodeo element that sees you take direct control of your foe, and even attack other monsters with it. Turning monsters' signature attacks against their own is real crowd-pleasing stuff, and the enduring physicality of these wriggling wyverns has never felt stronger. They're tough to control, but so they should be given their size and might, and the tension that comes with trying to make the most of these brief windows never fails to raise your heartbeat.As always, the goal of hunting these scaly beasts is to harvest their flesh for precious hides, fangs and scales to forge ever stronger sets of armour and weapons for you and your two animal companions. You can only carve off three bits of monster after any given hunt, although your cat-like Palico and dog-friend Palamute will often scavenge a few extra doodads on your behalf to help bulk up the numbers. Even so, you rarely have enough to craft a complete armour set after just one hunt, so you'll often have to head back out for another round to fill in the gaps. This is the age-old rhythm of a Monster Hunter game, creating a natural grind that some may just not have the patience for. Personally, though, I rarely had to repeat specific missions just to get at particular monsters, as there's usually a handful of them roaming around anyway, regardless of what mission you're on. Sure, you'll still have to go through the same 15-20 minute tussles in order to take them down again, but the generous 50 minute time limit means they're usually pretty comfortable detours - especially when you can see exactly where they (and your actual target) are on the map. Heck, even the usually tedious resource gathering missions have been speeded up by letting players ride on the back on their Palamute.All this arguably makes Rise one of the most friendly and streamlined Monster Hunter games yet, although you'll still have to wade through an inordinate number of text box tutorials at the start before you're left alone to properly enjoy it. Accessibility has never been one of Monster Hunter's strong suits, and Rise, too, struggles to show rather than tell you how to get the best from it. Much of it should feel familiar if you've built up some muscle memory from World over the years, but newcomers are likely to still feel quite daunted by it all. The one thing I am thankful for, though, is a marked shift away from capturing monsters as opposed to just hunting them. Capturing monsters with traps is something I've been bad at in previous Monster Hunter games, and getting stuck on these missions has often been the reason I've stopped playing them. With Rise, however, there isn't a single capture mission until after the first end credits and you unlock the level 5 missions. Superior hunters can still trap and capture monsters whenever they wish, of course (and get rarer material not available via carving in the process), but the lack of emphasis on it in the main campaign is a very welcome change.The only slightly bum note in Monster Hunter Rise's roster is its new Rampage missions. Rather than heading out into the wider world for these, Rampage missions see you protect your home hub town of Kamura Village from waves of monsters in a kind of arena-based tower defence game. It's a fun diversion the first time you do it, but firing at monsters from mounted gun turrets is nowhere near as gripping as a proper hunt. Thankfully, these too can be largely ignored if you'd rather stick to traditional monster slaying, but the fact they just get packed off into a separate mission menu, potentially never to be seen of or heard from again, does somewhat undermine the thrust of the main story. The village elders would have you believe Kamura Village is constantly on the verge of being annihilated by these rampaging beasts, but that tension never really manifests in the overarching mission structure. As underwhelming as the Rampage missions are compared to regular hunts, even I was surprised I only ever had to do the one of them as part of the main campaign before I saw the first set of end credits. For the most part, though, Monster Hunter Rise is another stonking addition to the series, and in my books a more than worthy successor to Monster Hunter: World. There's a generous and playful sense of freedom here that keeps combat and exploration feeling fresh, and the momentum of its hunting-led missions means you're rarely spinning your wheels as you seek out that last elusive armour part. It's kept me playing much longer than I ever did with World, and I can't wait to see how it develops with its imminent Sunbreak expansion later this summer.You're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!

Monster Hunter Rise,Cassie Peterson,GamingTrend,https://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/monster-hunter-rise-review-the-rampage-grows-to-more-platforms/,"My favorite thing about video games is that I get to go to worlds that I could really only dream of. I get to interact with different stories, both fictional and based in reality. Video games allow us to feel like gods, to feel empowered. One of the games in particular that I was absolutely in awe of was Horizon Zero Dawn. You’re going up against massive, monstrous machines with naught but a bow, a spear, and some well placed traps. After Horizon Zero Dawn, I was on the hunt for another game that would instill in me that same awestruck feeling, one that would make me feel powerful even against mountainous odds. That’s when I was introduced to Monster Hunter: World.I easily sank close to 200 hours in Monster Hunter: World. Even though the process is repetitive, the grind became addicting as I battled against monster after monster in my efforts to craft the strongest weapons and gear before heading off to battle a walking volcano, a diamond dragon, and so many other wondrous creatures. I used the bow as my primary weapon (not a bowgun, just a normal bow), which I was told wouldn’t be the best option if I wanted to be able to go on solo hunts at higher Hunter Ranks, however I stood my ground against the Tempered Kirin, the Seething Bazelgues, and the Fulgar Anjanath just as well as any glaive user. In games like these, it’s all about mastering your craft, learning attack patterns and damage queues, and knowing when to dodge, duck, dip, dive, and dodge.After spending so much time in The New World, I was surprised and disappointed when I learned that the next Monster Hunter game wasn’t coming to Xbox and PlayStation, at least as far as we had known at the time. To be fair, it made sense for Monster Hunter Rise to be placed on the Nintendo Switch — afterall, many prior Monster Hunter releases were on Nintendo consoles — but why couldn’t the Switch share with the other platforms? World had been an astounding success, quickly shattering records. But, alas, it was not to be.Until now.Monster Hunter Rise just released on Xbox and PlayStation on January 20th, giving more people the chance to head to Kamura Village to defend against the Rampage that threatens its people. Kamura Village has a beautiful historic Japanese aesthetic that is also present in the armor you craft and the clothing of the villagers. In previous Monster Hunter games, you are accompanied by a Palico companion but Monster Hunter Rise introduces the Palamute companion to run alongside you and your cat friend. What I love most about the addition of the Palamute is that you always have a faster traversal option than running on foot as you can ride the Palamute around the map. In Monster Hunter: World you were able to ride smaller monsters around, but the Palamute is also a battle buddy with other purposes – all around more reliable.It was really easy getting back into the rhythm once I really hopped into Rise. My least favorite part is always the tutorial phase, wish I could skip past all of it, but I guess it is helpful to know where to get my grub before going on an excursion, where to upgrade my gear, and to hang out with my owl companion, my Cohoot, who I have graciously named… Hooter. (Oh, I should’ve named it Whoo-ter, missed the opportunity there.) Cohoots can help you find monsters if you’re a little lost on a hunt and they can help you find hidden treasures around Kamura Village. All of your furry/feathery friends can be customized with different fur/feather patterns as well as their clothing and even their voices. I don’t mean that they’ll start speaking the common tongue, but you can choose different bark styles for your Palamute and meows for your Palico. Imagine if they did start talking, though… Well, some Palicos do have dialog boxes.The one part of the game that I STILL struggle to grasp is using the wirebugs. I understand what they’re used for, however I struggle with the execution of their uses, especially traversal, like scaling cliff sides. I did get really good with using them to mount monsters that had gotten into fights with each other to do some big damage, but aside from that they are pretty useless to me at the moment.One thing that stands out for me is how buttery smooth Rise is on my PlayStation 5. The framerate is variable depending on what’s going on on screen, however, there was never a point where it noticeably dropped. Load times were a bit of a pain with Monster Hunter: World but it’s not an issue with Rise with the transition between locations taking maybe 10 seconds max. My only gripe, if it really even is one, is that graphically Rise isn’t as up to standard as I felt World was. I know this is a port, but I’m still kind of surprised that more wasn’t done in this area. That’s not to say the game looks bad, there’s definitely no shortage of character, detail, and inspiration. Maybe I’m just too picky from being pampered by games like Horizon and God of War where they took full advantage of the next generation hardware. There’s truly nothing wrong with Rise in the graphics department, but there is a noticeable difference when comparing the two games in my opinion.In terms of gameplay, Rise has been a refreshing reintroduction to the series for me. After Monster Hunter: World I turned away from the series, skipping over Stories 2 entirely as the Stories games hadn’t really piqued my interest. It is a little daunting to restart the grind for gear and to ascend the Hunter Ranks again, which is why I don’t play MMOs anymore. Unlike with World, I don’t have a co-op partner for Rise, which can make some fights a little more difficult if you don’t want to queue up with randoms online. However, after diving back in for this review, and discovering the dual blades are so much better than the bow in Rise, I can see myself sinking a lot of time into this one. Monster Hunter Rise isn’t as long as Monster Hunter: World, clocking in at roughly 21 hours versus World’s 65 hours, but if you are trying to grind it out for all the gear and doing all the extra events, you’ll still easily sink over 100 hours, especially with the Sunbreak expansion coming to PlayStation and Xbox in the Spring.Monster Hunter’s return to PlayStation (and Xbox) is a very smooth transition. The game performs perfectly and gives more players the opportunity to head to Kamura Village for another awe inspiring adventure. —Cassie PetersonSee below for our list of partners and affiliates:One of the longest running independent gaming news, reviews and culture sites on the web.The thing that is magical about the Wizarding World isn’t the magic – it’s...by Ron BurkeThe world is going to end.

Monsters Rise once more to fight.
Go! Take arms in hand!Monster Hunter Rise is the latest in the long-running franchise, and arguably the best yet. It may not be as pretty as World, but it makes so many quality of life changes I suspect it would be hard to go back. While I’m not the most experienced hunter out there, I’ve only been playing since 4, I still have a blast with each entry since the gameplay loop of hunting to get better equipment so you can hunt more monsters and get better equipment is so addictive. That being said, I do have quite a few gripes with the series as a whole.If you’re not familiar with the series, the premise of Rise is exactly the same as every other game in the franchise: you’re the newest local hunter, so go hunt some stuff, and eventually, a big bad monster will do something bad that you need to put a stop to by… doing the exact same thing you always do. The games have never been known for their intricate plots, but Rise does make slightly more of an attempt. Rise has a very Japanese aesthetic that adds some nice flavor to your surroundings and keeps things from feeling stale. The plot also ends up the same as the previous games, but Kamura Village and its inhabitants have more personality than ever before in the series. Instead of painted planks of wood, they’re more like cardboard cutouts. I really like this aesthetic, especially the terrible poems introducing each monster that are lovable and corny, but I still think the series could do with a bit more plot.The real meat of Monster Hunter is in the combat, which has been refined to a sharp point here. While the Sword and Shield remain my favorite of the 14 weapon types to use, even my mainstay feels better to wield than it ever has before. Weapons are divided into two categories: Blademasters and Gunners. Blademasters focus on getting up close and personal with the monster, while Gunners stay slightly further away and use various ammo types to deal damage and induce status effects like poison or sleep. I generally prefer Blademaster weapons, so let’s use my darling Sword and Shield as an example. Your basic combos involve pressing X, A, occasionally ZR, and moving the left stick in various combinations to perform attacks. Simply pressing A will perform a lateral slash, while pointing to a direction and pressing A will do a shield bash. Knowing your weapon’s moveset is the key, as only certain parts of attacks will allow you to dodge out of the way or block a monster’s devastating blows. For example, you can cancel the lateral slash at any time but the shield bash combo needs to finish its animation first. While the basics can be difficult to learn, the high skill ceiling along with monsters’ clearly telegraphed attacks makes every single hunt a delicate dance of knowing when to attack, when to dodge, and when to back off and use an item. In addition to your myriad of standard combos, you can learn additional skills to switch in and out at item boxes to really tailor your playstyle. Continuing with the Sword and Shield, I swapped out my standard dash with X and A for a slide attack that leads into a jump for extra mobility which makes it feel like my weapon took a page from the aerial focused Insect Glaive with how much I stay in the air now. They’re a great addition, though I wish some were easier to get since the first set requires an arena quest and every other one requires their own, difficult hunts in High Rank.While I didn’t spend too much time with them this time around, Gunners play better than ever before. Picking up the Bow, I discovered it basically functions like a third-person shooter now. When your weapon is drawn, you use ZL to aim and ZR for basic shots or X and A for special abilities. Overall the more complicated weapons feel like they’ve had their playstyles simplified somewhat, though in a way that doesn’t remove any depth from the weapon. In particular, the Hunting Horn has seen a huge rework, shaving down the large songlist to just three powerful skills simply played by pressing the same button twice. Everyone appreciates a good Hunting Horn in their party, but having to wait for them to play all their buff songs before moving out could be a drag at times so this speeds things up.Rise is much faster than its predecessors overall actually, getting in and out of a hunt is faster and easier than it’s ever been. This is mostly thanks to your new best friend: your trusty Palamute. When you start a new game, you customize your hunter, your Palico, and your Palamute. Before we get to our furry friends, let’s touch on hunter customization. There are very similar options to those in World, and you can even preview your character in all kinds of lighting and animations which is a nice touch. No doubt we’ll see more hairstyles and emotes added as DLC later on (the deluxe edition comes with one of each, as well as some cosmetic gear), but I only saw a single typically black hairstyle, which was of course an afro, so I hope Capcom adds more of these for free so every hunter can feel represented in their character. Other than that issue, you can customize your companions in just as detailed a manner as your hunter, complete with fur patterns and colors as well as their voice. You can also change your hunter’s appearance at any time and hire newly customized pals for a small in-game fee. It’s a great set of character creators that are simply fun to mess with on their own.Your trusty Palico might not see as much action this time around, as they’ve been booted from the stage by their doggo counterparts. While the kitty companions are more useful than they’ve ever been here, with multiple styles like gathering, attack, and support to choose from, you can only bring one friend on multiplayer hunts and that will always be your Palamute. Each area is still one big map like in World, but even with several shortcuts, they can still take a while to get around on foot, so you hop on your new best friend and speed off towards your target. Every monster is now listed on the map right from the get-go too, so no need to search around or even locate tracks. You can even use items and sharpen your weapon while riding, giving other hunters a taste of the Sword and Shield’s majesty. These features really smooth out the experience in a way I didn’t know I needed and make the game perfect for handheld play.While the Palamutes are great, my favorite additions are the Wirebugs and wallrunning. Wirebugs are what the name implies: basically portable, flying grappling hooks. You have two by default but can pick up a third temporarily in the field. With your weapon sheathed, you hold ZL to activate them and can press X to launch into the air, A to dash forward, or ZR to fly to where you’re aiming. You can use these to charge towards a monster or reach new heights in zones by launching towards a wall and running up it by holding R. To complement this, every zone has a new vertical element to it. You can climb mountains to collect herbs quickly or take a detour to get buffs from the new endemic life, Permabuffers (cute little hummingbirds who can increase your maximum health, stamina, attack, and defense for the duration of that hunt).Wirebugs aren’t just useful for exploring, however, every weapon has two special attacks that use one or two of your charged bugs. The SnS can dash forward and into the air with ZL and X or, my personal favorite, attach the sword to a bug and spin it around rapidly in a whirlwind of damage with ZL and A. These attacks deal Mounting Damage, which is shown with a blue background. Upon dealing enough Mounting Damage, you can then Wyvern Ride that monster and essentially fight as them for a short time. Damaging yet another monster enough will fill up the Mounted Punisher gauge, which unleashes a devastating attack on your prey as you dismount. If you don’t want to or don’t have time to find another monster to attack, you can instead launch your mount at the nearest wall or monster for still massive damage. Using Wirebugs, you can launch a monster up to four times. Wyvern Riding a particular monster only happens about once per hunt though, so you need to be quick and decisive. If you got through all that and haven’t played a MonHun game before, congratulations! These games have a lot of mechanics to manage and keep track of, we haven’t even touched on gathering, Meowcenaries, crafting, forging armor and weapons, elements, submarine missions, or arena quests. Rise may be the best game in the series by far, but it has a long, long way to go to be accessible to newcomers, let alone disabled gamers. Monster Hunter has always been about as dense as a giant slab of concrete, but it’s getting ridiculous how hard it is to learn just how to play the game. World had a nice combo tree you could refer to built into the HUD to help players learn exactly what their weapon can do and how to do it, which helped me start using weapons like the Longsword and Switch Axe, but that’s mysteriously been removed here. The only place in-game to find any information about your chosen weapon is buried in your Hunter’s Log and even then it’s very barebones. I shudder to think about the User Experience of players starting here. The difference between Low Rank and High Rank hunts is also more confusing than ever. The game divides the story between two quest types: Village and Hub quests. Village quests are designed for one player while Hub quests are designed for a full team of four hunters and each has their own story. In theory, this is a great change; you can still play either type in single or multiplayer, and having a single-player story when not connected to the internet (like Dragon Quest X) is a fantastic compromise. However, in practice it just makes things feel disjointed. For one, Village quests are Low Rank only so once you have access to High Rank and its superior materials for making weapons and armor there’s no reason to go back. The Village story also just ends with no real resolution, with Hub’s continuing far, far longer (about 40 hours in and it’s still not over despite the plot having little substance). Again, I like the concept, especially if Village quests could be used more so for farming materials, but it’s executed in the worst way possible.Finally, let’s go over Rise’s new quest type: Rampages. These are essentially tower defense missions where you use artillery that you set up in certain locations to defend the gates to Kamura Village. I didn’t watch any trailers or look at gameplay announcements before jumping into Rise, and I have to say I’m very pleased with this new mode. It’s a ton of fun, especially with other players, and breaks up the admitted monotony of hunts while still providing you with materials to progress. This is also another annoying new feature that dampens the fun a bit: Hunter Voices. Your characters can now speak preset phrases in chat in addition to giving you helpful warnings when a monster is about to unleash a devastating attack or run away. These can be incredibly useful at times and give your hunter a bit of personality based on the voice you choose, but they’re mostly annoying. You can adjust how often hunters speak up in the options, but even at the lowest of 20% they just. Won’t. Shut. Up. It’s not as bad as JRPGs like the Tales and Xeno series, but it comes close.While it’s still too difficult to get into, Monster Hunter Rise is the best entry to date. Hunts feel faster and more dynamic than ever and additions like Weapon Swap Skills, Wyvern Riding, Palamutes, the Rampage, and especially Wirebugs keep the gameplay fresh and exciting. —David FlynnSee below for our list of partners and affiliates:One of the longest running independent gaming news, reviews and culture sites on the web.The thing that is magical about the Wizarding World isn’t the magic – it’s...by Ron BurkeThe world is going to end.

Monster Hunter Rise,Alexander Cope,Windows Central,https://www.windowscentral.com/monster-hunter-rise-pc-review,"No offers foundWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.Back in 2018, I was introduced to what would quickly become one of my favorite games of all time, Monster Hunter World. It was an amazing action game that allowed the player to hunt large, terrifying monsters and perform awesome feats of strength I thought were only possible through cinematic cutscenes in other games.Since then, I've been hooked on Capcom's Monster Hunter series whether I was hunting in the frozen tundras of Monster Hunter World: Iceborne or befriending monsters in the Pokémon-like RPG spin-off Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruins. I would always be there to see what new action-hunting adventure Capcom would come up with next. And today, I get to review the PC port of Monster Hunter Rise, courtesy of an early-access review code provided by Capcom.A few months ago, I got the chance to preview Monster Hunter Rise's PC demo (provided via an early-access code from Capcom) and I was feeling optimistic by the end of my play session. The PC demo's updated visuals and frame rates improved the demo's gameplay immensely compared to the Nintendo Switch demo. So, I was looking forward to seeing whether these upgrades would help refine the gameplay of the full PC version. Does it succeed? Let's grab our hunting gear and find out.Bottom line: Overall, the PC port of Monster Hunter Rise is superior to the Nintendo Switch version, thanks to the PC enhancements. It has some of the best combat mechanics in the Monster Hunter series, the new monsters are an absolute delight to hunt, and the improved frame rate and resolutions enrich the hunting experience. It does have a couple of flaws, but they are minor issues in the grand scheme of things.One of the big selling points of the PC version of Monster Hunter Rise is the improvements it has made to the frame rate and resolution. The Nintendo Switch version was only able to achieve 30 FPS with a 780p resolution. Meanwhile, the PC version is able to achieve uncapped frame rates and 1080p or even 4K resolution. It also includes other graphical upgrades such as high-res textures, motion blur, depths of field, anti-aliasing, detailed shadows, and more.My PC rig is equipped with an Intel Core i5-9400 CPU and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 GPU, so I was able to run the game at 60 FPS with 1080p resolution with no issues. You won't have to worry about getting the latest, cutting-edge PC graphics card or GPU to experience this game's enhanced visuals and performance.Going from 30 FPS to 60 FPS made a huge world of difference when it came to gameplay. Inputting commands on the original Nintendo Switch version felt stiff and caused my attacks not to execute half the time, and I had to resort to button-mashing to make sure they would register. Thanks to the higher frame rates, this flaw is fortunately not present in the PC version. My attacks came out exactly when I inputted the commands, making the combat system feel much smoother and more fun, especially during the turbulent Rampage Quests.The improved resolution also heightens the monster-hunting experience. Seeing the monsters with more detailed scales and fur textures made their designs more visually appealing compared to how they looked on the Nintendo Switch. The special effects of attacks also received visual upgrades, with anti-aliasing smoothing out the edges so that they no longer look like pixelated smog. This makes fights against certain monsters much more enjoyable since it's easier to see what's going on on-screen and the visual spectacle of their attacks is now pleasing to the eye.My favorite aspect of the presentation is that the graphics settings show you images of how the game will look when you tweak the settings. This is an amazing quality-of-life improvement I wish more PC games would have because it helps those not familiar with advanced graphic settings set them more easily without having to research online.My only issue with Monster Hunter's presentation is when you hunt with other players in multiplayer. Monster Hunter Rise is the first Monster Hunter game where players can take an NPC partner with them in multiplayer — a Palico or a Palamute. While this sounds cool in theory, it can cause some hunts to become unnecessarily disorientating in execution. Having four players and four NPCs fighting a monster simultaneously can lead to dozens of explosions and special effects going off at once, making it hard to tell what's going on and straining the eyes.To make matters worse, the option to reduce the special effects (or ""hit effects"" as the game calls them) in the graphics settings does little to mitigate the sensory overload. Thankfully, this problem mostly happens when you fight a monster in an enclosed space like caves or tight corridors. Still, this issue could be resolved if there were an option to turn off the hit effects of other party members and only leave your attacks with the hit effects on.The impetus for why you're hunting monsters in Monster Hunter Rise is to arm yourself in preparation for a cataclysmic event known only as ""The Rampage."" Every 50 years, monsters that ordinarily would be fighting each other in turf wars, suddenly get this inexplicable urge to band together in hordes and go on a stampede, destroying everything in their sights.Your home, Kamura Village, was almost destroyed by this unnatural phenomenon 50 years ago, and now signs are showing ""The Rampage"" will be happening again soon. As one of Kamura's newly appointed hunters, it is up to you to defend Kamura Village from ""The Rampage"" and find out what has been causing monsters to berserk in the hopes of ending this calamity once and for all.The premise of Monster Hunter Rise is your typical Monster Hunter affair — a peaceful village gets threatened by monsters, and you are tasked with stopping them. It's a simple monster-of-the-week plot that's mainly concerned with setting the player off to hunt cool monsters based on Japanese mythology, and it doesn't change beyond that. So, if you're looking for an action game with a deep, complex narrative packed with novellas worth of character development, you won't find that here.Monster Hunter Rise follows a linear, mission-based structure where you are tasked with hunting a monster within a time limit. These missions take place in various diverse ecosystems with multiple heights of elevation that you must traverse if you're to find your prey. To help you accomplish your assignments, you can pick up crafting materials on the map to make potions and traps, and pick up small animals called endemic life to boost your stats.Your character is also accompanied by a host of animal companions that aid you during the hunt. First is the Wirebug, a large insect that produces ironsilk, allowing you to swing through the air and help you climb up mountains. The second, the Palamute, is a large dog-like creature that you can ride to travel at great speeds to reach your destination. And finally, there's the Palico, a humanoid cat that can assist you in battle with traps and gadgets.It is incredibly satisfying to read the monster's attack patterns and learn when to dodge and counter them with the new Silkbind Attacks.When you have located the monster, it's time to slay them with your chosen weapon. Monster Hunter Rise has 14 weapon types for you to use, each with their own movesets, strengths, and weaknesses. The Wirebug can also allow you to perform aerial attacks and use supermoves called ""Silkbind Attacks"" during combat. Once you have damaged the monster enough times with Wirebug attacks, you can use the Wyvern Riding mechanic to briefly take control of a monster using the Wirebug's ironsilk like a puppeteer to attack other monsters or crash it into a wall.Upon slaying or capturing your quarry, you collect their body parts as a reward for your efforts. You then take the body parts back to Kamura Village's local smithy, and he'll use them to forge powerful weapons and armor so you can hunt more dangerous monsters higher up in the food chain.This forms the core gameplay loop of Monster Hunter Rise, and it is just fun as it was on the Nintendo Switch. It is incredibly satisfying to read the monster's attack patterns and learn when to dodge and counter them with the new Silkbind Attacks. I was brimming with excitement at the new weapons and armor you get killing these beasts. The over-the-top designs remind me of the more fantastical weapons and armor from Monster Hunter 4 and Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate. This motivated me to hunt the monsters multiple times so I could use their parts to forge entire sets of gear and show off how cool they were to my friends.One of the best additions of the PC version, aside from the graphical enhancements, is that it comes packaged with every free post-launch update the Nintendo Switch version had up until Ver. 3.6.1 (the November 2021 update). This includes the finale of the High-Rank quests' storyline, several new monsters to fight, and Event Quests, which reward new weapons, armor, poses, emotes, stickers, and more. This means that PC players won't have to wait several months for the PC port's content to catch up with the console version like they had to do with the PC port of Monster Hunter World.In between the standard hunting quests, the time will come when you must defend the village from ""The Rampage"" in the form of Rampage quests. Rampage Quests are tower-defense-like missions where you must fend off wave after wave of monsters coming to bash down Kamura's gates. In addition to your arsenal of weapons and traps, you can set up defense turrets (both manual and automatic), use environmental traps, and summon NPCs to help you halt the horde's advance. You also have access to gongs, which once rung, give yourself and your teammates a massive damage boost so you can dispatch monsters more quickly.To complete Rampage Quests, you must keep the gates of Kamura Village safe until the timer runs out or you defeat the leader of a horde. The leader of a Rampage horde can be either a Major Threat (an enlarged version of a regular monster) or an Apex monster. Apex monsters are mutated variants that are utterly immune to traps and Wyvern Riding and feature new attacks that hit like a megaton bomb.I will admit I didn't take kindly to the Rampage Quests at first, when playing solo. I would often get ganged up upon by monsters and get thrown off my turrets which led to a frustrating first impression. However, once I understood the intricacies of each defensive installation and put together a game plan, I started to enjoy the Rampage Quests. I went from being a monster's chew toy to a one-hunter army that annihilated every horde before they could even breach the first gate.The Rampage Quests truly shine when you play them in multiplayer. Having multiple players control a pack of monsters to beat an Apex monster while another player blasts it to smithereens with cannons was an amazing arcade-like experience. Not to mention the rewards you get for conquering the Rampage Quests are worth the planning and effort.Since the PC version's upgrades fixed my biggest issue with Monster Hunter Rise from the Nintendo Switch version (the overall looks and game feel), the only other criticisms I have are core gameplay flaws that lie in both versions.My first criticism is the limitations of the Switch Skills system. Switch Skills is a gameplay system that lets you switch out attacks in your weapon's moveset with new ones. These Switch Skills can offer creative and exciting new ways to play your favorite weapon. However, there is a problem I have with this system. While you can switch a few regular attacks moves from your moveset, you can only switch out one of your two Silkbind Attacks.This means that with some weapons, I'm stuck with one Silkbind Attack that I don't find appealing to my playstyle, and the Silkbind Attack I can switch out, it's a move I don't want to remove. I would much rather prefer it if I could switch any of my weapon's supermoves to diversify my gameplay, much like how you could with Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate's Hunter Arts.My second and biggest complaint about Monster Hunter Rise is the Melding Pot. Without getting into spoilery details, the Melding Pot is a system that allows you to use monster parts to create accessories for your character called Talismans. Talismans add passive or active buffs to your character's abilities (which are called ""armor skills"" in this game) or enhance ones already granted by your weapons or armor. However, the Talismans produced from the Melding Pot have randomized stats, i.e., they could possess any armor skill in the game and at any level. This means that you could spend weeks at the Melding Pot and never get the Talismans you want to help you build your character exactly how you want it.However, this doesn't mean you can't defeat monsters without optimal Talismans. Every weapon and armor set you can craft through normal means is viable and will help you kill any monster so long as you are skilled enough to use them. Nonetheless, farming for Talismans is still a very tedious activity that could've been done better. I would prefer it if we could create Talismans with the exact abilities we want, much like how Charms, the accessories from Monster Hunter World were made.Overall, I enjoyed the PC version of Monster Hunter Rise much more than I did the Nintendo Switch version. The PC version's improvements made the gameplay much smoother to play and has helped me appreciate aspects I didn't like initially, like the Rampage Quests. Plus, all the bundled free post-launch updates will keep players busy for weeks to come.The flaws regarding the restrictive Switch Skills and Melding Pot may not seem like a big deal at first, but they become more noticeable as time goes on. It is my fondest hope that these issues are addressed in the upcoming paid DLC expansion, Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, so this game can truly reach its full potential as one of the best games in the Monster Hunter series.If you're looking for a fun game to play with your friends, then I highly recommend checking out Monster Hunter Rise when it launches on Jan. 12, 2022. It is one of the best multiplayer games on PC and the perfect way to start the new year.Let's get ready to hunt!Bottom line: Monster Hunter Rise is a solid action game that features a superb combat system and lots of extraordinary creatures to hunt with your friends. The PC port improves upon the original game's foundations with higher frame rates and resolution to give players a more polished hunting experience.Alexander Cope is a gaming veteran of 30-plus years, primarily covering PC and Xbox games here on Windows Central.

Monster Hunter Rise,Dom Peppiatt,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/mar/24/monster-hunter-rise-review-capcom,"Nintendo Switch; CapcomFlush with flash new tricks, simpler action and a bulging roster of hostile creatures, the latest instalment of the enduring series is an absurd delightAfter you’ve felled a hard-scaled, fire-breathing dragon in Monster Hunter Rise, you can pose for a photo with your loyal cat and dog (taken by an owl, no less) as its corpse lies in a contorted rictus of agony in the background. Nothing better sums up the Monster Hunter experience than cutesy poses offset against a once-proud giant lizard, broken and humiliated, waiting to be carved up into tomorrow’s armour. That sense of achievement and joviality after brutal and bloody violence is the loop of tension and release that’s kept this series in the charts for 17 years.Monster Hunter Rise deviates from the uncomfortably colonialist new-world casings of Monster Hunter World and leverages the newfound global popularity of the series to tone things down, take things a bit slower and bring you back to a more rural, communal setting: Kamura Village. But this idyllic slice of sylvan Japanese-inspired life is uneasy; the recurrent calamity of “the Rampage”, an apocalyptic event where the local fauna all turn blood-crazed at once, is in the back of the locals’ minds at all times.As luck would have it, though, you – a new hunter – have the tenacity and skill to repel this encroaching oblivion of gnashing teeth and rampant claws. Cropping up now and then among the usual range of monster hunts, Rampages come off somewhere between tower defence and chaotic Dynasty Warriors battles, punctuating the narrative and offering the game’s most serious challenge.Away from these hordes, you’re a hunter. In their midst, you’re prey – and that’s thrilling. Most of the time, you don’t feel like a part of the food chain in Rise. Not like you did in Monster Hunter World, at any rate. This game is a little less empowering: monsters are softer and more forthcoming with their rewards, and they don’t rage and thrash against their inevitable defeat with quite the terrifying vigour that they have in past games.Monster Hunter has long been the poster child for connectivity and collaboration for Capcom, so it’s no surprise things speed up when you’re playing with other people. The game’s netcode runs seamlessly – even despite the Switch’s historically shonky online play. Drop-in, drop-out play – whether you’re docked or in handheld – happens effortlessly, echoing some of that early magic that made the series so ubiquitous in Japan in the 00s. If you’re playing with friends, you’ll be wearing your dream armour and sharpening your favourite weapons within hours, not days.It makes sense that the branching weapon techniques of World have been dialled back a little, and everything feels more arcade-y. Special attacks can be swapped out on a whim to make movesets more flexible and comfortable to play. Fourteen weapons, interchangeable skills, ludicrous anime-inspired special attacks that have you leaping around like a particularly flamboyant Power Ranger … it all compresses into a fun, easy-going action game that delights in letting you soften a monster up for 15 minutes before putting it out of its misery with a stylish flourish. It’s perfect for more time-pressed followers of the series, but might leave veterans under-occupied.But given that you can mount a dog, ride it into battle, then hop on to monsters and turn them against the other yetis, fox-dragons, T rexes or whatever else happens to be within biting range, before zipping off back to your village with the help of a magic bug, it doesn’t seem like Rise should be taken all that seriously. This is a game about relentlessly hunting monsters until you’ve practically pushed a whole ecosystem to the brink of collapse; it’s absurd, it’s theatrical, it’s inane, and it’s fun, a delightfully silly recalibration of a time-tested and powerfully absorbing adventure.Monster Hunter Rise is out 26 March; £49.99."
Monster Hunter Rise,Jason Dailey,Gaming Nexus,https://www.gamingnexus.com/Article/10767/Monster-Hunter-Rise/,"When Monster Hunter Rise came across the Gaming Nexus wire for review, I don’t mind admitting that I had no palpable reaction as someone who has never partaken in a Monster Hunter title. A couple of the GN crew chimed in that it was a great game, and that someone should definitely review it on the new systems. Obviously I obliged, but as a franchise noob myself my only burning question was: “Is it accessible to people like me?”. After my time with Rise, I would say the answer is largely a “yes”, but also partially a “no”.Proceedings begin with a robust character creator which allows you to create the monster hunter you’ve always envisioned yourself to be. I’ve never been particularly great at making myself in those sorts of situations, so I played around with the various options but ended up sticking with one of the preset faces that looked like Revolver Ocelot from Metal Gear Solid 4 (naturally, I had to name my hunter Ocelot). I thought I was done there, but I was then gobsmacked by a healthy dose of charm (which Rise has in spades) at the next screens, where I got to customize my Palamute and Palico companions. The Palamute is a canine sidekick that serves as a rideable mount, but also will be right by your side as you fight monsters. Likewise, the Palico is a feline sidekick that can serve one of many roles such as Healer or Gatherer. What you choose will depend on your playstyle and what you feel will be most helpful to you. Because I was brand new to the series, I figured it would be helpful to go with a Healer Palico, and it certainly was, as it saved me on multiple occasions. I’m sure I’m not the only one, but I took far more time customizing my Palamute and Palico than I did my character, because I wanted to create my real-life pets in-game to help me crush monsters.Once you have built your team to your liking, the game will introduce the story to you, which honestly is not much of one. It’s a loose tale about monsters coming back to wipe out Kamura village, and naturally as a newly-minted monster hunter you must help protect Kamura from the impending monster scourge. The story in Rise is like that loaf of bread or basket of rolls you get when you’re out to eat at a restaurant – it’s just there to get you started. That’s not a knock on the game per se, because at the end of the day you’re coming for the monster hunting and (likely) staying for the monster hunting.In that regard, the hunting itself is quite enjoyable. Capcom has managed to take the fun of mini-boss and boss fights and distill it down into a game made almost entirely of nothing but boss fights. As a newcomer, it reminded me quite a bit of fighting the beasties in The Witcher 3, only you do it over and over. Thrashing monsters is a great time, but there were a couple of instances when things began to feel stale to me. Those moments soon passed thanks to the game throwing a brand new monster my way, giving me a new set of attacks, movement patterns, and weak points to learn.I also have to point out my utmost appreciation for the enemy design in this game. There are some very cool looking enemies, from gigantic killer rabbits to flying monkey snake-things (that’s the best I can do), it is all very well done. Likewise, I appreciated the varied move sets of my foes. I’ll never forget the creature that had a flatulence-based area-of-effect attack that forced me to apply deodorant to my character to remove a negative status effect. As you might expect, some of the monsters are an absolute pain. There is one stone-covered dragon in particular that I avoided whenever possible. He was one tough beast to crack…okay, I’ll see myself out.There is a large arsenal of weaponry at your disposal in Rise, and much like your Palico, what weapon you choose to main will largely be down to personal playstyle. I bounced off of the ranged weapons pretty quickly in favor of up-close-and-personal options like the hammer (my personal favorite), the switch axe, and the great sword. Like the monsters, each weapon has its own attack patterns, primary attacks, secondary attacks, and specials. One of my biggest recommendations is to switch weapons immediately if you start to get frustrated or things start to feel stale. Ultimately, you are grinding for better weapons and gear which are crafted from parts that you scavenge off of defeated monsters, so that you can hunt even more powerful monsters, to craft their even cooler looking gear – you get the idea. Monsters have their own inspired gear sets which can only be crafted with an adequate number of each necessary part. I need two more of a certain part from a Medusa-like beast to craft a pair of boots and complete its gear set, for instance. It looks rad, by the way!Hunts are broken out over multiple quest levels, with you starting at quest level one and working your way up to higher tiers and tougher monsters by completing enough quests at each level. Completing enough key quests in each tier unlocks an urgent quest, which also doubles as a plot device to move the story along, and you to the next quest level. Quests typically took me between 10 to 30 minutes, which felt appropriate. It absolutely must be noted that the single-player and multiplayer have separate quest progression in Rise, meaning that if you get to quest level five in single-player, that does not mean you are level five in multiplayer. The two advance independently of one another. Thankfully though, your gear and weapons are shared between the two, so it is not a complete separation. To be clear, I don’t think this is a bad thing. If anything, it adds legs to the game because it creates plenty of endgame content to digest.What I do take issue with in Rise are unwieldy menus, a glut of items, and ancillary systems that are the wrong combination of poorly explained and convoluted enough to where I stopped engaging with them altogether. Look, I understand that it’s 2023 and nearly anything can be found with a quick search of the web, but I will never accept that as a means to write-off teaching players how to play your video game. I’m not referring to things such as looking up a video for a good strategy to beat a tough boss. But when a game gives me dozens of consumables or crafting ingredients, for example, but does not adequately explain how to use said ingredients, I take issue with that. In-game encyclopedias don’t do it for me in most situations either, as I don’t believe players should be expected to read pages of menu text to know how to craft an essential tool. Now, for instance, if I need to know how to craft a variant of something for a specific use, then that is acceptable, but the basics should be…well…basic. I’m not looking for my hand to be held the whole way but I do need you to teach me how to walk before letting go. That may upset some Monster Hunter faithful but Rise is abrasive in that regard, and to be fair it’s an issue with a lot of games these days.For my review, Capcom strongly recommended that I play multiplayer, and after doing so I completely understood why as it is the best way to play, in my opinion. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoyed myself on solo hunts, but pairing up with other hunters is my preferred way to play. It’s not always easy to test multiplayer functionality in a pre-release environment, but fortunately I was able to get in several hunts with Eric Hauter, our Editor-in-Chief, and resident monster hunter. I’m proud to report that the monsters never stood a chance. We thrashed them, and I mean we thrashed them good. Well, okay, other than me losing track of my health bar and getting KO’d that one time, but don’t worry about that. Cooperatively hunting beasts while chatting with a friend helped me to realize that those brief moments of staleness I mentioned earlier were largely because, for me at least, this game beckons to be played with others. Capcom clearly knows that as well and, put simply, multiplayer elevates Rise to a new level.As I mentioned earlier, the single-player and multiplayer quest progression are separate, but function in the same way. If you don’t want to grind as much in multiplayer to raise your quest level, you can also complete Special License Tests in single-player to jump up an entire quest level on the multiplayer front. These tests typical involve fighting multiple monsters on one quest and are worthwhile if you are a hunter who is confident in their skills. Difficulty also dynamically scales in multiplayer depending on your party size. So if you have four players on a hunt, the monsters will be sufficiently difficult, and even if someone drops in or out mid-hunt, the difficulty will scale down or up appropriately.I’ve written a lot here and still have not touched on some secondary and tertiary systems such as Meowcenaries or Rampage quests, and I think that alone sums up Monster Hunter Rise quite well. A franchise noob like me was able to pick-up and play and have a great time, but I couldn’t help but feel like I was still only scratching the surface at times due to the opaqueness of some of its systems. In terms of how I play games, I don’t like leaving food on the table, so to speak, but I’ll leave that gaming broccoli on my plate every single time in favor of the meat and potatoes if it’s not appetizing.To be clear, Monster Hunter Rise is exceptional. If boss fights are your favorite part of games then you’ll love this, and while it is good in single-player, it shines brightest in co-op with friends. Whether you are looking for something to play casually, or something to really sink your teeth into, I feel confident saying that Rise can check either or both of those boxes for you.Monster Hunter Rise distills the fun of boss fights into an entire game, and it excels at doing so. While it is good in single-player, the best experience is found online playing with fellow hunters. Despite not adequately holding the player's hand in regard to its ancillary systems, Rise never gets in its own way, and offers a fun experience for both casual players looking for short bursts of fun, as well as the more hardcore looking for a time sink.* The product in this article was sent to us by the developer/company.Hello!

Monster Hunter Rise,Blake Wilson,COGconnected,https://cogconnected.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-ps5-review/,"Initially released on March 26, 2021 for Nintendo Switch and on January 12, 2022 for PC, Monster Hunter Rise now makes its debut on PS4, PS5, Xbox One Xbox Series X|S.How well does the game fare on current-gen platforms? Let’s find out.The PS5 version shows vast improvements in graphics and performance over the Nintendo Switch version. Both the PS4 and PS5 version let you pick between different graphics settings. There is a “Graphics” mode for higher texture quality and a “Performance” mode for better framerate, as well as a balanced “Default” mode.Additionally, there is a “Custom” mode. In the game options you can manually adjust all graphics settings to your liking, allowing you to scale the image quality, texture quality, shadow quality etc.It will show you the “Processing Load” for your chosen settings. Basically, the higher the load, the bigger the impact on framerate, the lower the load the better the framerate. This is a pretty neat feature that is normally reserved only for PC versions. I don’t recall any other PS5 game having this many customizable graphics settings, and it still runs great in all of those settings. Pretty cool!All that said, you can tell it used to be a Switch game built to run on the much-lower-spec handheld console. The previous game “Monster Hunter World” still looks better today than Rise does. After all, World was built for higher-spec consoles from the ground up, but Rise is not far behind.If you played Monster Hunter World before, Rise will feel very familiar. You have the same weapons and attacks, and the basic functions and items/crafting are the same. You have a “hub” village from where you accept all hunts, then you embark on those hunts to slay (or capture) monsters. Basically, everything you know from Monster Hunter World is still there and applicable.The main gameplay-affecting additions are The Palamute, which is a dog-like mount you can ride on, and the Wiredash ability that allows you to jump in the air from anywhere by pressing L2+R2, then you can follow up with powerful midair attacks. The Palamute is a game-changer as it lets you ride around the map at high speed to hunt down monsters quickly. You can also use it to ride away from fights quickly if you are close to death. Riding hostile monsters is also possible and triggers when two monsters clash together. Then you can usually ride one and use it to attack the other monster. This makes for some interesting matchups. All these mechanics make the game easier than World.Besides this, the main story quests are also noticeably easier than World. There are two types of quests “Village” and “Hub”. Village quests are your main story. The monsters have very little health, most story hunts took me only 5-8 minutes. The entire story took me only 5 hours. Granted, if you haven’t played Monster Hunter before there will be a bigger learning curve and it will take longer. I wanted to see how far I can get without farming anything and got through it fine with the Basic Hammer and crafting new Armor when it became available. It required far less equipment optimization than World.In a way, it makes sense that the story quests are so easy and short, thus Switch-players on the go can do a quest during a quick break instead of pumping 25-40 minutes into a single hunt. For a portable game this “fast and easy” approach is fair. Just as an MH: World Veteran you will find it a bit too easy. I was surprised when the credits started rolling already after a few hours of gameplay.As any Monster Hunter player will know, the real game starts when you hit High-Rank. That’s where the Hub Quests come into play. They are meant for 4 players but are also feasible solo – your 2 AI helpers, the “Palico” and “Palamute” will help you out. In Hub Quests the monsters have comparable health to Monster Hunter World. Now it feels like a real Monster Hunter experience.There is one new mission type that stands out: Village Defense. In this mode you must fight waves of monsters by building defenses. These are things like placing bombs on the paths of monsters and building ballistae to shoot monsters with. You have to stop the monsters from breaking through the main gate of the village. I liked the idea of this new mission type, but the High-Rank village defenses were the only time it felt imbalanced for solo players. The Hub missions are geared towards co-op gameplay so it shouldn’t be a surprise but if you are a mostly-solo player like me keep this in mind. Some of these defense missions are mandatory to increase your Hunter Rank, so you may need to buy PlayStation Plus to play with other people online for this. Solo it would be very annoying.Each time you go on the hunt for a new monster, you get a beautiful cutscene showing off the monster with a poem that explains its characteristics. I thought those poems were a lovely way to introduce you to the new enemies. Coming from MH: World there are new ones you haven’t seen before and also some familiar faces.Overall, the monster types are easier than World, with more non-flying monsters that stay on the ground and are easier to hit for melee players (not so many flying dragon-types).If you loved playing MH: World you will most definitely fall in love with MH: Rise, too. All the great stuff you know and love is still in Rise with some smaller tweaks and additions. I had a good time and it was worth waiting for the graphically improved version. My only gripes are that Rise is too easy compared to World (especially the story), yet High-Rank defense missions are imbalanced for solo players, and it doesn’t look as graphically pleasing as World.***PS5 code provided by the publisher for review***Developer: CapcomPublisher: Capcom"

Monster Hunter Rise,Neil Bolt,PlayStation Universe,https://www.psu.com/reviews/monster-hunter-rise-ps5-review/," Neil Bolt / January 17, 2023Monster Hunter Rise PS5 Review. The PS5 finally gets a port of the latest Monster Hunter title. Is it great to get back to the hunt? Find out in PlayStation Universe’s review!It doesn’t seem like five years since Monster Hunter World brought the long-running franchise to a much wider audience than ever before, but PlayStation owners who fell in love with that game have still been hankering for a fresh slice of the monster-hunting pie. So, it was naturally a bit disappointing to see Monster Hunter Rise drop exclusively on Nintendo Switch in 2021, and PC a year ago. But now it’s finally here on PS5, and it’s fair to say it’s just about worth the wait.The sixth mainline game in the series, Monster Hunter Rise takes the improvements made in Monster Hunter World and a few pieces of Generations, then refines and streamlines them, and chucks in a pot of fresh additions. I like to think of Monster Hunter Rise as a rearranging of the table set by World, with some changes to the seating plan.The player is a freshly-anointed hunter in Kamura Village who happens to be starting the job just as signs of an disastrous event known as the Rampage is about to kick off. When the Rampage previously occurred, the village was attacked by hordes of frenzied beasts, so it’s up to you, the player, to try and get the jump on this situation before it escalates out of hand. You’ll be dealing with the Rampage at some point, but for now, it’s time to slip back into the comfy familiar slippers of some good old-fashioned monster hunting.Having begun life as a Nintendo Switch game, Monster Hunter Rise isn’t quite as visually detailed as its predecessor, though it does retain that game’s seamless maps. That would be a drawback, but the cleaner, clearer view of what’s going on here actually makes for more efficient, comfortable hunting. It’s a step back that brings back a little something that felt like it was missing in World.It’s still a sleek-looking game, and everything moves at a quicker, more fluid pace than World did. Loading in single-player is massively improved, with an almost instant jump into maps outside of a few occasions where a narrative intro to the mission at hand is required. There’s far less tracking of monsters here, with the impetus on getting into the thick of things as quick as possible.The fights can still be epic of course, but the buildup to your battles is generally far less laborious in Rise. Perhaps the maps lose a bit of the winding wonder they had in World by being a little more compact and relatively simple in structure, but this still contains all the things that made the hunt a hoot last time around.There’s something moreish about Rise’s structure and it has a lot to do with how the whole hunting process has been streamlined without losing the obvious Quality of Life improvements from the previous iteration. By being initially made for a portable console, Rise regains a compelling immediacy for the series.Among the new additions to the series’ arsenal is the grapple hook-style Wirebug (itself an evolution of what was found in World’s Iceborne expansion) to make short work of vertical travel in certain places and can also be used to ‘Wyvern Ride’ bigger monsters, and utilize them as makeshift weapons against other monsters or just to a load of damage to them by smashing their weird skull into a cliff face. But to really get going, Palicoes are no longer the only animal friend you can have.Palamutes are basically very big dogs that can be used as steeds to get around maps quicker, but they also are able to contribute in battle. When playing solo, you can have two AI partners of your choosing from Palico and Palamute alike, and it really adds a new dimension to combat. In co-op, you can only choose one, so a new layer of strategy is added in online play.I was quite pleased that Monster Hunter Rise does a grand job of making single player play work. I really like Monster Hunter World, but to play it solo was almost unbearable. For this review process, solo play was practically the default option, so it was a relief to find it was more palatable this time around.Unfortunately, it does get a bit repetitive when solo play is your only option. Obviously not a problem post-release, and there’s a clear avenue for a personal resurgence with Monster Hunter Rise when it has a larger audience on PS5, but the flaws of solo play are absolutely laid bare when put under the scrutiny of extensive sessions. In a way, regular solo play is almost a tutorial for the meat and potatoes of what Monster Hunter Rise offers, but the desert is where it really earns its keep.The aforementioned ‘Rampage’ brings a tower defense mode that is the most utterly thrilling addition to the series. Whether alone or with friends, ‘Rampage’ has an intensity you simply cannot get elsewhere in the game. Waves of monsters will assault your base, and you need to prepare for that with the right setup and the traps to slow their aggressive progress.I know most people don’t much care for what Fortnite was (an open world tower defense game) before it became a Battle Royale game, but I personally love it, and having Monster Hunter Rise do something similar to that game is a personal highlight for me.Monster Hunter Rise is just about the right mix of refinement, streamlining, and progression to make for an enjoyable sequel. Rather than bloat what was already teetering on the edge of excess, Rise prunes the formula to show its inner beauty more clearly. It’s a shame this is not packed in with the Sunbreak expansion, but there’s plenty to be getting on with what is the sleekest Monster Hunter experience on PlayStation.Monster Hunter Rise is due out on January 20, 2023 for PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One.Review code kindly provided by publisher.While not as technically impressive as its predecessor, Monster Hunter Rise succeeds as a follow-up by focusing on getting players into the hunt quickly and comfortably without compromising on challenge.

Monster Hunter Rise,Scott McCrae,Push Square,https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/monster-hunter-rise,"GuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpMonster Hunter Rise2023 8.1Game RatingUser Ratings: 21Our Review: Scroll DownTigrexcellentVersion Reviewed: EuropeanNine days after this review goes live, it’ll be five years since Capcom’s Monster Hunter series finally conquered the Western market in the form of Monster Hunter: World. Even for those of us who have been playing since the days of Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate, World felt like a breath of fresh air as the series finally hit the big time — and was no longer restricted to the wildly uncomfortable Nintendo 3DS. Now, after being one of the best Nintendo Switch games of 2021 and one of the best PC games of 2022, Monster Hunter Rise has arrived on Sony’s shores to be — shocker — one of the best PlayStation games of 2023.Going into World, it felt like Capcom’s design philosophy was to make a classic Monster Hunter experience, but pile on the quality of life changes to make the game more accessible. Rise takes that ethos even further, focusing on the movement mechanics of the series to create the best-feeling Monster Hunter game ever made.First off, the new companions: palamutes join the beloved palicos to aid you in your hunt. While these crafty canines can do the standard attack and support tasks that palicos (or those two little freaks from MH3) have been able to do for years, they can also be mounted like a miniature horse. This not only allows you to get around faster without using your own character's stamina, it also lets you sharpen your weapon while on the move, which is a godsend. Most importantly, you can also drift while on your dog, which is sick.The other central mechanic in Rise is the wirebug gauge, which we cannot gush about enough. The extra layer to traversal, combat, and pacing that the wirebugs add completely changes the game in ways we haven't seen in the series since Monster Hunter 3's divisive attempt at underwater combat. Wirebugs work in many ways, the most prominent being their core use as a zipline, allowing hunters to fly around the map in a way previously reserved for the insect glaive weapon.These bugs also add to the game's combat with extra offensive and defensive options. Every weapon hosts their own switch skills — the title's equivalent of special moves — which range from souped-up attacks like the great sword's catapult to defensive options like a charge blade parry, which instantly fills its phial meters. Each weapon comes with unlockable moves to customise your experience, which more than make up for the lack of any new weapons in this release. In terms of defence there's the wirefall, which allows you to negate a knockdown at the cost of a bug. This can be used to escape those tight situations where you've been knocked through the air, primed to lose the fight.But what is a Monster Hunter game without monsters? Rise boasts a roster of 40 monsters (with six having powerful apex variants) and it's a mix of new and classic beasts. As the land of Kamura is based on ancient Japan, the new creatures are primarily based on Japanese folklore — and the result is some of the best designed foes in the series. Front and centre is Magnamalo, whose samurai-inspired look makes for one of the best flagship monsters the series has seen since the sadly-absent Gore Magala. Our favourite of the bunch has to be the Goss Harag, a hulking ice beast inspired by Oni-yokai.Rise's story revolves around the Rampage, a calamity that once besieged Kamura village 50 years prior, and has now mysteriously returned. This ties into the rampage missions which work as a sort of tower-defence game in which you set up turrets and traps to repel monsters before they can destroy the gates protecting the village. Rampages are at their best when played with one or more extra hunters, but they're more than serviceable on their own and offer a fun experience outside of standard hunts.One other way Rise improves upon World is through its multiplayer integration. In World, all of the game's hunts were accessible from the same quest board. While it was a good idea in theory, it led to a lot of faffing about as certain missions couldn't be played in multiplayer until certain criteria was met. In Rise, it's much cleaner. You have the village hub, which consists of easier low-rank quests for solo players; then there's the gathering hub, where the missions designed for multiplayer missions are housed (but you can still play these solo). This is where you'll be spending the majority of your time, as upon completion of the village quests or the low-rank quests in the multiplayer hub, you gain access to the gathering hub-exclusive high-rank quests, which offer up new monsters to hunt as well as harder variants of previous monsters with new attacks and new material drops.You also can't have a Monster Hunter game without great tunes, and thankfully Rise delivers here, too. The first time we heard the horns kick in on the Sandy Plains flamenco-inspired battle theme, the hype hit us like a tidal wave. Even songs that previously existed in the series like Spark of Blue (the theme of Zinogre) get their own ancient Japan-inspired remixes. We also can't talk about the music without mentioning the absolutely wonderful 'fluffy bunny dango' tune that plays during the adorable cooking animations, which had us smiling from ear to ear the first time we saw it.Rise was quite the looker for the Nintendo Switch at launch thanks to Capcom's incredible RE Engine. While it still looks nice here on PS5, there are noticeable visual downgrades from the likes of World in some instances. However, worse visuals are a fair trade for the silky-smooth frame rate — something the Switch version doesn't have.This edition is also fully updated at launch, so issues present when Rise originally released — like the missing conclusion — are not a problem here. But there is the elephant in the room in that the Sunbreak expansion isn't included at launch, and is instead arriving in spring. Considering this isn't a full price release, we don't feel like this is too much of an issue, especially since there's already enough content in the base game to easily last you until the spring.Monster Hunter Rise is the new standard for the series, and it's a delight to finally have it on PlayStation, thanks to the improved frame rate and visual fidelity over the original release. There's so much to it that there are still many things we haven't mentioned, like the new monster riding, sped-up collecting and mining, or the hunting helpers. It's a game this reviewer put over 100 hours in on the Switch, and we could be looking at 100 more on PS5. Monster Hunter's eternally satisfying gameplay loop is met with now-essential quality of life and traversal improvements.Excellent 9/10Scoring PolicyReview copy provided by CapcomComments (37)I'm excited to play a MH game that's easier to grasp (as a newbie I found even World to be a little heavy going at times). And at £32.99 it's a nice price point to boot!Good to see the PS5 version is getting the same great game that Switch and PC got. Really wanted to double dip for this version but no physical means no purchase for me. Also still mindboggling no Sunbreak on release.Excited for this but going to hold off on the hopes of a Game + Sunbreak expansion physical copy.Does anyone know if it's 60fps on PS4? Should be possible seeing as it's a Switch game but the fact I can't find any confirmation is a bit worryingWish I could like these games but they are so repetitive to me even though that’s the point and have like no story which I need anymore to see me through a game. I hope fans have a great time though it looks like one of the best yetwill be playing on game pass, then get it on ps5 once sunbreak comesAwesome, I loved what I played from the demo on switch but man the blurriness always gets to me on that console so I held off in hopes of a ps5 port and it paid offNow I just hope the little bugs that boost your stats aren't as obnoxious to collect as they were in the demo. So hyped for FridayFantastic game and i wish i could play it on my PS5 but i'm too invested in time and money with the Switch version to move to the PS5 version. Happy its a great port though.Haven't even gotten Iceborne yet, holding off this.@dark_knightmare2 it's all about the combat, it's deep, varied and well animated. Crafting unique weapons and outfits. Struggled to get into World at first but it clicks when you finally understand how to play the game.I really wish that we could transfer our saved but I know that's never going to happen. I put tons of hours on the switch and I just can't see myself starting all the way over again.Thankfully I waited for the non inferior versionNice review. Monster Hunter Rise was an incredible experience on Switch, and it's cool to see people on other platforms being able to experience it.Seems like a shame they couldn't manage cross-platform play, though. Every ecosystem having their own walled off online community isn't ideal. Especially when, being frank, these ports are only going to enjoy a fraction of the attention that the original Switch release did.@dark_knightmare2 If you have a Switch or gaming PC, or if it eventually gets ported to other consoles, consider playing Monster Hunter Stories 2. Sounds much more up your alley with its story focus and more traditional RPG structure.Loved world and genU, couldn’t get into this one.Wasn’t a fan of the wire bugs really, and I think MH fatigue took hold, as most of the monsters are the same as world and genu.The hubs were lovely though, the best even and some armour was good, although the female armour sets are not always on par with the male counterparts unfortunatelyBeen looking forward to this for a while. Got it presinstalled ready to go on gamepass, big game for the service@Kanji-Tatsumi Not seen anything about frame rate apart from ""the frame rate is variable on each platform, depending on the gameplay situation and the performance of the platform you are playing on"".As far as resolution goes:""PS4, Xbox One and Xbox One S versions at 1920×1080 resolution. PS4 Pro and Xbox One X run at 3840×2160 resolution, the same as current-gen consoles.""Not a fan of the monster Hunter series it's too Japanese & strange for me lol , monster Hunter world is arguably better though since rise was limited by the switches hardwareWhen this was announced I thought this version was complete WITH Sunbreak, disappointed it isn't.Huge Monster Hunter fan and while I much prefer World and the older entries (Rise is way too 'streamlined' in its mechanics), I'll be snapping this up when Sunbreak is released later on 😁Hopefully they decide to put it on PS+ at some point to entice new players!N.i.c.e. monster hunter world and iceborne is excellent.monster hunter rise looks good also.word up son@Nalodart
I've always found the female sets to be much better than the males, even in Rise. Don't think I've had male character since Monster Hunter Freedom 2. Completely agree about the wirebugs... They aren't exactly fun to use imo.Love MH Rise so much, glad more players will get to enjoy this game now  Happy hunting everyone!@LoamyI always had a female myself, and don’t get me wrong some look decent, but too many have giant metal dresses for my taste 😂Not sure that sly dig at Switch was needed in the cons.You may want to think about the wording, it reads as though the PS5 has visual downgrades compared to the Switch. I assume you meant compared to other PS5 open world titles like HFW?@HeeHo I don't really see it as a dig. It's objectively true that the environmental design and character geometry in MHR is less dense and detailed than in something like MH World because it was designed from the ground up for a weaker console.It's not a bad thing, necessarily. It is what it is. And it does probably represent a pretty shocking visual downgrade from World, if that's your baseline for the series.@HeeHo @bighal Didn't intend on it being a ""dig"" at Switch. Its just the easiest way to bulletpoint when mentioning that the game has some visual downgrades in comparison to World or what you would expect a PS5 Monster Hunter to look like.For what it's worth Switch is my main platform for Rise, I have no issue with the way it looks on there.@JB_Whiting Sunbreak will be a nice reality check if you think base game was easy.@HeeHo Less of a ""sly dig"" and more of a fact really. The game looks great but it's obvious the developers have the ability to push the visual detail much further as with MonHun World. I think it's fair for a review to mention this as some might find it an important factor and particularly noticeable after playing the previous PS4/5 entry (not that I personally care).Needs a disc version.@brazzios_84 Sunbreak was also easy though. Which is fine, a harder game is not always a better game, but I do feel in general World (and in most ways, Iceborne) was both better and more challenging in the right areas. The only thing about Sunbreak I liked more than Iceborne was gunlance.Not a fan of the new combat either, but thankfully this is the Portable team so it shouldn't transfer to the main series.Is there dualsense support? And if yes is it any good like Resident Evil's?@SMcCrae95 you missed my point (I don’t have a Switch and I didn’t read it as a dig on Switch). “ Rise was quite the looker for the Nintendo Switch at launch thanks to Capcom's incredible RE Engine. While it still looks nice here on PS5, there are noticeable visual downgrades from the likes of World in some instances.”That reads as though PS5 is a downgrade compared to Switch. I think you meant compared to some other open world titles on ps5 like HFW.180 hours on the switch game and i will be doing it all again on ps5 and taking full advantage of the far superior chat option and the boosted res and FR. Such a quality game.@Nepp67 According to another review I saw, Dual Sense is pretty lacking. And where it was used, it is in places like pressing R2 would have some resistance when pulling up your shield.@SMcCrae95 I didn't understand the combat mechanics in MH World. Is Rise any better in teaching MH beginners how to play it?@brazzios_84 Gotcha, thanks! Hopefully the next MH they make on current gen takes advantage of it.@Loamy @Kanji-Tatsumi Same plan I have, not buying this until Sunbreak is out and bundled with the base game!Reading the digital foundry piece about this game covered the graphics settings and how you could toggle just about every setting in the options to suit and also the performance options etc. I think the review here could have mentioned that little bit of info as its made out as if the ps5 version has been held back and that just is not the case.

Monster Hunter Rise,Mark Steighner,COGconnected,https://cogconnected.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-pc-review/,"Monster Hunter RIse is arguably the best game in the franchise. It just landed on a PC, but is the personal computer the best way to play the game? Let’s talk.After bouncing off many earlier Monster Hunter games, I fell in love with the series thanks to Monster Hunter World. It had a short but engaging campaign that onboarded me into the game’s arcane mechanics. It had fantastic production values and sharp graphics. Whether on PC or console, Monster Hunter World had a large community of players and an immense amount of content.In a weird way, playing the earlier Monster Hunter games was to me what new Dark Souls players must go through: confusion and frustration. World, on the other hand, was just the oversized, hand-holdy experience I needed to get me hooked.Monster Hunter Rise — a Nintendo Switch exclusive — both takes the franchise back to pre-World complexity, and at the same time makes the game even more varied and open-ended. Although the environments are more compact than that of World, Rise introduces a number of mechanics that make exploration and combat even more fun.The new Wirebug is a literal game-changer. It allows players to grapple unreachable ledges, parkour up walls and explore vertical spaces, or attack monsters from above. The new Palamute dog allows the player to ride across the landscape and chase after fleeing monsters. Plus, it’s an adorable companion and complement to the resource-gathering Palicoe. Everyone works together in combat in an incredibly engaging way.Although Rise does not have the blockbuster campaign of World, it makes up for it with monster hunting that is even more varied. No two fights ever play out the same. There are weapons to suit every play style, a ton of upgrades and armors, and consumables. It’s dizzying, in a good way, to have so many options.Rise’s story — a rather simplistic premise about monsters invading the village of Kamura in a mysterious Rampage — is there to frame the action, but little else. Still, there are a number of NPCs, vendors, and oddball characters that are at least momentarily engaging.It’s clear that Monster Hunter Rise is laser-focused on fighting monsters, alone or with others. It does its level best to push the combat and hunting to the front, streamlining many tasks. Grinding, crafting and quest-finding are all now quicker to complete and involve fewer steps. While there are tool-tips and tutorials, Rise absolutely assumes prior Monster Hunter experience. It is much less welcoming to totally unfamiliar players. If you played World, everything you learned still applies. If you’re a new player, it may take some time to reach full speed.The very good news is that Monster Hunter Rise’s mechanics and fun factor are off the charts. It’s also good news that, after a year of waiting, PC players can now join the fun. There are hundreds of hours of new and added content, much more than Switch players had access to when the game launched a year or so ago. It’s even playable with mouse and keyboard, though I can’t imagine wanting to.The bad news, relatively, is that holdouts hoping for a high-end graphical makeover will be at least a little disappointed. Load times are faster, framerates are better, there are a number of settings that can be tweaked, and there even some photo mode filters. Those players disappointed by the spare options of the Final Fantasy VII remake port won’t have much to complain about with Rise.Textures are sharper and a little bit improved over the Switch version. That said, players hoping for something like the visually impressive World will be quite let down. This is not a 4K showpiece, but a Switch game with some relatively minor graphical improvements for PC. Even though the port is relatively undemanding of decent GPUs, I did have some screen tearing and pop-in.In the case of Monster Hunter Rise, gameplay absolutely triumphs over visuals, but I wish we could have had both. Rise has stellar art direction and monster design, however.If you don’t have a Switch, or you were holding out for the PC version, Monster Hunter Rise is a no-brainer purchase. Temper your expectations for high-end graphics, and be prepared to enjoy the game. If you’ve invested a lot of time in the Switch version, your progress won’t carry over. Moving to PC will net you some visual improvements for sure. Rise on PC isn’t a revelation, though. It’s just a better way to play an already great title.Monster Hunter Rise is probably the best game in the series. It isn’t quite as accessible as World, but long term it offers much more varied combat and a richer experience. Its world and gameplay are insanely engaging and fun. Technically, the port to PC results in solid, smooth gameplay and marginally better visuals. If you have a choice, it’s definitely the way to play, the best and most complete version of one of 2021’s standout games.***PC code provided by the publisher for review*** Developer: CapcomPublisher: Capcom"
Monster Hunter Rise,Andrew Farrell,PC Invasion,https://www.pcinvasion.com/monster-hunter-rise-review/,"Monster Hunter Rise is kind of weird when placed directly beside Monster Hunter World. There’s more variety to the monsters, but the game doesn’t demand nearly as much of your time. It’s also a port of a Switch game, so it doesn’t look as good as the previous in certain ways. People have been playing World game on PC for a while now, and may find the visual differences jarring. The game itself also feels lighter and breezier, with plenty of new mechanics and lots of the trademark action the series is known for. Rise is also a great port, all things considered. Let’s get hunting.Right off the bat, the aesthetic of Monster Hunter Rise is decidedly Japanese (even more so than usual). You create your hunter and are dropped into Kamura Village.  A horde of monsters, led by a single super-strong monster that strengthens itself by eating its members, is periodically attacking the village. It’s up to you and, well, everyone else playing the game, to fight them off and keep the village safe. The dialogue outside of cutscenes is unvoiced and the general tone is fairly child-friendly, hewing closer to Monster Hunter Stories 2 than Monster Hunter World. You can choose between the game’s in-universe language, English, or Japanese for the voice snippets and cutscenes, if you so choose. Despite originally being a Switch game, Monster Hunter Rise does look damn good on PC, even if it lacks some of its predecessor’s visual polish. Textures are high resolution, everything is nice and sharp, and animations are as fantastic as you’d expect. You can notice where the game was held back due to being developed for the Switch, but the series is still in fine presentational form here. The game also comes with all the updates that have been released since it hit the Switch last year in March.Monster Hunter Rise is a focused game with little to no interest in wasting your time. The story mode of Monster Hunter World could easily take players dozens of hours. Finding monsters once you set off required tracking the thing and then heading towards it on foot. Instead of doing that, Rise basically puts you on a mount and pushes you right toward your prey immediately. Monsters are now marked on the map, with a big question mark on display if you’ve never encountered them before.Players also have a second AI-controlled buddy backing them. Joining the palico cat characters are palamutes. Yeah, they’re dogs. Ridable dogs. After being dropped at your base camp, you can grab a bite to eat to get yourself certain buffs, as well as take what you want from the quest item chest. You then hop on your palamute and set off. Honestly, I prefer the way Monster Hunter Rise handles things. Palamutes are quick and have a ton of stamina, so they’re great for getting where you’re going in no time flat. You can attack while mounted as well, or you can leap off and slam your weapon into the enemy beasts. Whatever works.You can no longer use a grappling hook to sling yourself onto monsters and climb them a la Shadows of the Colossus. The grappling hook has been replaced by wirebugs, which you can use to climb upward or fling yourself at a chosen point. Areas in Monster Hunter Rise are very big on verticality, so you’ll find plenty to see on top of taller points, plus the terrain wildly varies in height. Many environments have deep valleys, often featuring shallow water.While you can’t clamber around and stab away directly on a monster, you can now mount other monsters. Your prey will oftentimes get into territorial disputes with another monster in the area. When this happens, you can mount one of the downed monsters and use it to attack the other. It’s a great way to turn the tables or just do a lot of extra damage. The fact that this can happen whenever a monster turns tail and makes like a tree adds even more layers of unpredictability to the game. Much of the general structure of the zones is intact from World, though.If you lose all of your life in the field, your monetary rewards will get reduced. Go down three times and you get kicked back to the village. One interesting difference is that quests are divided between solo and group hunts. The solo quest line probably won’t take most players longer than 20 hours. You can’t bring other players with you, but the monsters here are meant to be soloable. Monster Hunter Rise is very beginner-friendly in that manner, which certain folks are less than happy about. Granted, stronger monsters can still knock the tar out of you, but this is a less difficult game than players are used to.Another great new addition the Rampage, which functions as a special quest where you defend the village’s gates from the horde of monsters. You can put down emplacements that allow you to shoot at the horde, you can bring out bombs, call allies, or just hit them like you’re used to doing. These are fun and feel quite different from the usual flow of the game, which I enjoy. The solo questline may not take all that long, but, boy, does it move.The way questing works is that you have to complete a certain number of missions to progress. You have multiples to choose from, and these include a bunch of new monsters to fight each go-round. While it lasts, you fight new monsters constantly, unless you’re farming older ones to make new weapons or armor sets. Even if Monster Hunter Rise can’t feasibly keep people as busy as World did, there’s still a lot of content here. This is especially true for anyone who wants to complete their armor sets and make all sorts of new weapons, which is always fun. The weapons are so different and each has its own strengths, so I would often find myself going out of my way to try out new builds.Of course, the group hunts are where it’s at, and the monsters will put up much more of a fight that way. Advanced quests also open up once you finish the main story, which includes recent DLC, so there’s a lot to do. You’ll also be busy crafting accessories to give you the skills you want. Plus, the expansion’s on the horizon, and PC players won’t have to wait nearly as long to get their hands on it. Plus, it’s easy to play at high framerates.Monster Hunter Rise is another entertaining entry in the venerated franchise that continues to scratch a unique itch. New players will be eased into the franchise and returning players will enjoy hunting with friends as well. Capcom has also delivered yet another good port that definitely makes this version the one to play.Another good port from Capcom makes Monster Hunter Rise the best version of the game to get.About Us

Monster Hunter Rise,Francesco De Meo,Wccftech,https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-pc-dont-fear-the-rampage/,"The Monster Hunter series took a long time to truly blow up in the West, and it was only with Monster Hunter World that it became a true worldwide phenomenon. This isn't really surprising, considering the series has been pretty much a handheld affair for much of its existence, and World was the first home console exclusive release in a very long time.With the series' handheld and home console releases now being equally successful, it was not surprising to see Capcom bring their features together on Nintendo Switch with Monster Hunter Rise. Releasing a console exclusive Monster Hunter game may have been a weird choice, in light of World's massive popularity, but one that did pay off, as Rise is one of the finest entries in the series ever released, even with its flaws. The game is such a good one that it managed to make someone like me, who never really managed to get into any previous entry in the series, a fan. And the excellent PC port only made things go smoother.Like pretty much every previous main entry in the series, Monster Hunter Rise is very light in terms of story, as what little of it is in serves only as an excuse to embark on quests to kill or capture monsters. In the game,  players control a fully customizable hunter from Kamura Village who has to take part in the village's defense from the Rampage led by Magnamalo, a brand new monster that feeds upon the other monsters in the horde to become more powerful. Including almost all of the additional content released so far for the Nintendo Switch version, the new PC release doesn't end as abruptly as the 1.0 Switch release did, featuring a more complete experience. And while the story doesn't do a lot to elevate Monster Hunter Rise from its predecessors, the game's atmosphere certainly has a distinct, colorful Japanese flavor that feels great, especially compared to the more subdued tone of Monster Hunter World.No Monster Hunter fan should play any main entry in the series for the story, so the fact that Monster Hunter Rise doesn't really deliver on this front is hardly important. On the gameplay side of things, the latest entry in the series delivers in spades, streamlining the series' experience in so many ways while adding new mechanics that make for some very compelling gameplay.Like in previous entries in the series, the Monster Hunter Rise experience pretty much boils down to accepting mostly monster-slaying quests that take place on different maps. In Rise, finding monsters has been streamlined considerably, as their location is highlighted on the map straight away, so players can either go straight to them or explore around to get some materials first.Combat is clearly the star of the show in Monster Hunter Rise, featuring an incredible amount of depth. Each of the game's big monsters has its different combat behavior and moveset, which can be neutralized or even taken advantage of differently depending on which of the 14 weapon types are used. These range from some of the series mainstays like the Sword and Shield, Great Sword, and Long Sword to others that have been introduced more recently, like the Insect Glaive and Hunting Horn. Each weapon comes with a different gameplan that dramatically influences how any monster should be approached: the Long Sword, for example, comes with a variety of counterattacks that can be used to fill up the Spirit Gauge to unleash more powerful attacks; the Great Sword is a powerful yet slow weapon that requires perfect knowledge of a monster's moveset to attack without risking getting interrupted; the Sword and Shield allow the user to use items without sheathing the Sword and block attacks with the Shield, making for a more balanced weapon that is easy to pick up for newcomers. All weapons can also use two different Silkbind Attacks which require Wirebugs to be used that further expand their unique playstyles. Monster Hunter Rise is also the first entry in the series that allows players to customize the moveset of all weapons via Switch Skills, adding yet another layer of depth to the experience.Monster riding has also been overhauled with the Wyvern Riding mechanics, which allow hunters to ride monsters once they have been attacked multiple times with Silkbind attacks or if another monster inflicted enough damage. While riding monsters, it is possible to unleash various special attacks that can make hunts considerably easier, given how powerful some of these attacks can be, compared to the hunter's weapons.With all these intricacies, it can be difficult for newcomers to start enjoying Monster Hunter Rise right from the get-go, despite the game doing a slightly better job at easing players into the experience than previous entries. Monster Hunter Rise, like previous entries in the series, requires commitment. Sure, one may be able to take down a monster by hitting it over and over randomly, being baffled at how they do not seem to react to the damage too much, but this will hardly feel satisfying. Learning how to use a weapon's unique capabilities to take down monsters properly and stylishly is the true joy of Monster Hunter. This is the same in Rise, even though taking down a monster is generally pretty easy to do in Village Quests.As already mentioned, Monster Hunter Rise does a pretty good job at making every moment of the monster-hunting experience enjoyable. Exploring the maps has become even more fun thanks to the introduction of the Wirebug mechanics. This allows players to quickly zip from one place to another and launch in the air. With the proper Wirebug usage, it will also be possible to run on walls and take advantage of the fantastic verticality featured in all of the maps, opening up some new hunting strategies, especially for long-range weapons. If the player prefers to stay on the ground, however, they will not find themselves limited in any way, as they can ride the new canine companion, the Palamute, to traverse distances very quickly. The Palamutes, alongside the Palicoes, accompany the hunter in combat as well, providing much-needed support that makes it easier for solo players to complete both Village and Hub quests.Not that support is needed in Village quests, as they are quite easy to complete.These feel more like a tutorial for Hub quests, which are considerably more challenging, especially for solo players. Hub quests are also continuing to get expanded with new Event Quests, so those looking to enjoy the game with their fellow hunter friends will be busy for a very long time.While most of the tweaks and changes introduced in Monster Hunter Rise make the experience slightly smoother than in Monster Hunter World, not all of the new features are on the same level of quality. Rampage Quests, where hunters need to defend Kamura from monster hordes by lightly managing a stronghold and building defense mechanisms, aren't particularly fun, and they feel more like a chore, especially as a few of them must be completed to move the story forward. In addition, hunters looking to make the perfect build will be forced to complete them, as Defense Tickets obtained as a reward for completing Rampage quests are required to unlock Rampage Skills for weapons.It isn't just the Defense Tickets that make the life of hunters wanting to optimize their builds the best way they can hard in Monster Hunter Rise. The Talisman system, which allows hunters to create Talismans sporting certain skills, is made frustrating by the fact that you may not always get the best results. On the other hand, armor customization is way more reliable, as the Decoration System allows players to craft Decorations that can be used to decorate High Rank Armor to improve skills. While a little grindy, as you will need plenty of monster parts to craft these Decorations, this system is definitely more satisfying than the chance-based Talisman creation system.Having been originally released on the Nintendo Switch console, Monster Hunter Rise doesn't look as good as Monster Hunter World, although the different art direction makes the differences between the two games less aggravating. A less-demanding game, which still looks good thanks to the amazing RE Engine, however, means that most PC players will not have trouble running it at high framerates. The game supports 30, 60, 90, 120, 144, 240 framerate caps as well as unlocked framerate, and a moderately powerful system will have no trouble running it at above 60 FPS. The machine used for the test, powered by an i7-10700 CPU, RTX 3070 GPU, and 16 GB RAM, had no trouble running the game at 4K resolution, stable 120 frames per second at high to max settings.The fact that Monster Hunter Rise runs so well isn't the only thing that makes it one of the best console-to-PC ports we have seen in recent times. The game features ultrawide support and tons of different graphics settings, ranging from a High-Resolution Textures toggle to multiple shadows options, including Dynamic and Equipment shadows,  Level of Detail settings, and Anti-Aliasing options, and more. The game also does a great job of providing information on how each setting impacts system performance thanks to Graphics Memory Usage and CPU Load indicators, which make tweaking all the settings to achieve the best balance between graphics quality and performance incredibly easy.Monster Hunter Rise goes a long way to streamline many of the most annoying aspects of the series, at the cost of some of the complexity seen in older games. The pros of this streamlining process, however, far exceed the cons, making Monster Hunter Rise the perfect game for those who never really got into the series, but still want to give it another chance. Even more so on PC, thanks to one of the most solid ports we have seen in a long time.Review code provided by the publisher.With the streamlining of some of the most annoying aspects of the Monster Hunter experience and some excellent additions to the formula like Wirebugs and Switch Skills, Monster Hunter Rise reaches the heights of the best entries in the series with ease. While not all of the changes and new features have been for the best, like Rampage Quests, their general quality level, and the amazing PC port, do make the game one that's worth playing for both long-time fans of the series and newcomers.Subscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox© 2023 WCCF TECH INC.
