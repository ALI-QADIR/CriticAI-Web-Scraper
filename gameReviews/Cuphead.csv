Cuphead,Simon Parkin,Eurogamer,http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-10-02-cuphead-review,"Hanna-Barbaric.In the 1930s, employees at Universal Studio Cartoons devised a game to interrupt the bow-backed routine of inking cels and preparing animation frames. The men would work rubber bands and clumps of spit-mulched paper into spongy balls, hide them on their laps and, at an opportune moment, hurl the missile at the back of an unsuspecting colleague's head. A direct hit would be marked with a ""bullseye!"" that victory cry familiar to boisterous classrooms and offices everywhere, before everyone returned to their busywork, newly invigorated by the emotions of exhilaration, anguish and playful resentment now settling in the room.Shortly after he joined the company, Tex Avery, the Texan animator who would develop and popularise cartoon characters such as Daffy Duck, Droopy, Porky Pig and Chilly Willy, was busily working when he heard a co-worker shout a warning. Avery spun in his chair just in time to catch one of the projectiles in his left eye. This missile, however, was different: it had been weaponised with a thumbtack. Avery was instantly blinded in one eye. Robbed of depth perception, some speculate that the injury resulted in the unique, chaotic style of Avery's subsequent, era-defining cartoon work.50 years later, the emerging video game medium's art style was similarly funnelled and defined, not by the limitations of physical injury, but by the limitations of technological crudity. The chunky pixels, the three-head-tall characters, the graph-paper mazes, the backgrounds that scrolled like a slow-motion deck shuffle: video game development's artistic minds were forced to work in tight corridors of possibility. With time the boundaries scraped outwards, and games were no longer forced to share a family likeness. As style diversified, nostalgia for the old ways of working and seeing emerged and today the vintage aesthetic of the medium's earliest days is as commonplace as any other. Cuphead is a mash-up of these two stories, two rich traditions that have never before been blended with such gusto. It draws together the continents of 1930s animation, where every inanimate object, insect and mammal had wide eyes and moved with a bobbing, metronomic rhythm, and that of early 2D video games, with their simple rules and exacting, often cruel, demands. The novelty of the effect is astounding and long-lasting. This is not the first playable cartoon, but it is the first whose spell is weaved from and held by impeccably observed period detail - the washed-out tones, the brittle dialogue, the weirdly familiar characters, the fidgety appearance of hair and dust particles on the screen, as if the game was being luxuriously reeled off film and projected onto your widescreen TV via a hot lamp.  The titular character, a china cup boy in short shorts who shoots pellets by clicking his fingers with beatnik cool, is as recognisable as any Avery creation. So too is the pig that sells you upgrades, the ghost who counts your deaths or the devil against whom you ultimately fight, having beaten and collected the souls of his various eccentric minions. Artistic coherence extends far beyond the drawing board. See how every anthropomorphic object, from the sand timer used in loading screens to the devilish gobstoppers and slices of cheery toast you battle dips on its knees in time with the musical rhythm. And what rhythms they are: the rolling timpani, the chirruping flutes, the fluttering oboes, those startling stabs of trumpet, each instrument giving shape to thick dark rumbas, Dixieland fights of jazz, and the occasional piece of Tinseltown schmaltz. As a period piece of animation and music, Cuphead is peerless and immaculate.The structure, too, is familiar. Here, brothers Chad and Jared Moldenhauer, who started the project as a hobby before going all-in on the indie dream, re-mortgaged homes and all take their cues from Dark Souls (Cuphead even borrows Hidetaka Miyazaki's screen-squishing catchphrase ""You Died!"" for its game-over text). Cuphead must explore three islands in sequence, collecting, one by one, the souls of his marks in order to clear the path to the next. These marquee fights are extravagantly designed, with screen-filling characters that move through various phases of attack as you pepper them with your chosen ammunition. The designs are ingenious. See the red-faced genie, with his weaponised turban who, in his final phase, whips out a dangling puppet to do his fighting. Or the fat-faced jester who inflates balloon-dogs that attack you while, every now and again, sending over a toothy rollercoaster. Boss battles are interspersed with a few run-and-gun platform levels, while in another repeated vignette, you must protect a genie from the lunging attacks of ghosts by 'parrying' their attacks with a second stab of the jump button. Regardless of the stage type, the difficulty is wincingly high throughout. By default, it's three strikes and out for Cuphead (although you can add a health point by buying the appropriate upgrade). Even with seeker projectiles and other improvements installed, it will take even an accomplished player many attempts to learn and master the patterns of a single boss. Few will see it through.In part the difficulty is a function of a lack of clear on-screen information. Cuphead is a game, you sense, in which the artist won more arguments than the game designer. Every decision has been made in service to the aesthetic. Crucial information such as your lives, or how many screen-filling specials you have in stock is relegated to the bottom left of the screen, forcing your eyes to make perilous diversions. Enemies have nothing so vulgar as a health bar, but neither do they give any visual indication of how close they are to expiring, by turning redder, for example. This ensures that the game's pristine presentation is never compromised or cluttered. It also ensures that what is already a highly punitive game is made all the meaner. It is, however, mostly fair. This is not a Japanese bullet hell kind of shooter, where enemy bullets create a non-negotiable maze. There are, at any given moment, usually only one or two active threats on screen at a time. Difficulty derives from the combination of these threats (e.g. a sunflower's finger-like roots that jab up through the soil at the exact moment an airborne venus fly-trap descends from the sky). Managing space in between these constantly moving and mixing threats demands not only great skill but also some luck; it's possible to become boxed into unwinnable situations.As a result, Cuphead is as frustrating as it is exhilarating. There are Dark Souls-esque moments of extreme elation. But Miyazaki's series balances its brutality with moments of serenity and downtime, and pushes players forward with an alluring sense of constant acquisition (of both fine-motor skills in the hands, and ever-stronger weapons in the inventory). These traits are missing from Cuphead, for which the only route to progress is Karate Kid montage-style training and perseverance. The result is a curious combination: a wondrous, everyman style with a dizzying, elitist substance. You're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!

Not so much a boss rush as a boss crawl, Studio MDHR’s outstanding debut pits you against some of the toughest enemies you’ll face in a videogame, and the process of beating them can be slow and sometimes painful. But when you eventually do, the surge of euphoria is undeniable. Its difficulty hasn’t been understated, then, but crucially, it’s hardly ever the game’s fault if you get hit. You’ll shout and swear plenty, but you’ll know it’s really yourself you’re annoyed with.

Within seconds of a battle kicking off, you often find yourself fending off threats on multiple fronts, simultaneously tracking Cuphead’s position but also keeping an eye on something hovering ominously above, another threat incoming on ground level, and another projectile or five floating somewhere in between. With just three hit points, you’ve precious little margin for error; as such, once you’ve begun to acclimatise to a particular attack pattern, you’ll find yourself restarting if you take damage during that phase. That’s the first sign that Cuphead’s got its hooks into you. And then suddenly you’ll deliver the killing blow and the wave of relief and satisfaction is overwhelming. The clock will say it took you two or three minutes, but such is the relentless, exhausting intensity of these fights that each attempt feels five times as long. 

That feeling might not be worth persevering for if the controls weren’t immaculate. Equipped with a reliable jump and dash, Cuphead is nimble and responsive, his handling so expertly calibrated than an analogue stick—hardly ideal, you’d think, in a game designed for digital precision—never feels like a handicap. A parry move that lets you slap back any pink projectiles by hitting jump again in mid-air can occasionally seem a little fussy in its timing. Still, it’s used intelligently, letting you build your special meter—which can be spent in increments or saved for a huge blowout—and also doubling as a method of traversal.These are simple ingredients, but Studio MDHR builds a series of thrillingly diverse encounters around them. Bosses don’t just limit themselves to a host of different attack patterns, but adopt several distinct forms. Some play out like pursuits, while others are confined to a single, claustrophobic space. In one stage you’ll use the parry to nudge a handcar forward or back as you race alongside a train; in another you’ll slap springboards to clear a tall enemy. Meanwhile, random elements keep things fresh, meaning you can’t simply learn patterns by rote and rely entirely on muscle memory.A huge part of Cuphead’s appeal is seeing what bizarre monstrosity awaits you next.I’m skimping on specifics, but that’s because a huge part of Cuphead’s appeal is seeing what bizarre monstrosity awaits you next. Not that you’ll have much time to marvel at the astonishing hand-drawn animation, because you’ll be so laser-focused on surviving as soon as the announcer’s dispensed with the formalities. It’s only after the fact that you can really appreciate the ingenuity of the animation and design of these encounters. And it’s not just a pretty face either, with a big band soundtrack that comes close to matching the visuals, one highlight of which is an uptempo jazz number that briefly segues into Ride of the Valkyries.Cuphead’s bosses can be tackled on two difficulty settings: Simple (which is a barefaced lie) and Regular (hard). Beat them on Simple and you’re allowed to progress, but doing so locks out the finale, meaning you’ll miss out on a not-insubstantial chunk of the game. It’s only so useful learning the ropes this way, since many bosses use different attack patterns on Regular, or adopt a new form you won’t see at all on Simple. In other words, to see everything, you’re going to have to do it the hard way.Difficulty is subjective, of course, but while there’s no doubt some idiots out there who will claim Cuphead is too easy, most will find it a tough nut to crack. Whether it’s fair is a more important consideration. And the answer is: mostly. On occasion it isn’t, and it’s often those variables that spoil things, with platforms and enemies positioned in such a way that you take an unavoidable hit through no real fault of your own. Such incidents are relatively rare, but in a game as demanding as this, it’s frustrating that you do sometimes need a hint of luck to get by. In a game that earns your trust by establishing its rules and staying true to them, there are a few moments where it doesn’t quite hold up its end of the bargain.Still, 95 percent firm-but-fair to five percent bullshit is a more than acceptable ratio for what has clearly been a labour of love. There’s not a whiff of cynicism about Cuphead: from its aesthetic to its systems, it’s wilfully off-trend, and utterly its own thing. As tough as it gets, ultimately that’s what’s really worth shouting about.Not just for the masochists, Cuphead is a demanding but supremely rewarding modern 2D shooter that looks and sounds fantastic.How to get the Divine Relic in CupheadWhat to do with the Broken Relic in CupheadWordle hint and answer #665: Saturday, April 15By Phil Iwaniuk6 April 2023By Dave James5 April 2023By Kizito Katawonga4 April 2023By Jacob Ridley4 April 2023By Ian Evenden4 April 2023By Jorge Jimenez3 April 2023By Luke Winkie3 April 2023By Ted Litchfield31 March 2023By Robin Valentine31 March 2023By Katie Wickens31 March 2023By Dave James30 March 2023PC Gamer is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Here’s how it works.A potent cocktail of authentic 1930s aesthetics, jazzy tunes, ingenious boss designs, and gameplay founded on the fundamentals inherent to the best 2D shooters.

Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy.Ah, to be blistered again. My thumb hasn't felt this way since who knows when - but Cuphead lovingly put my opposable digit through the ringer, leaving a physical manifestation of hours spent in a highly focused, fervently determined, thoroughly delighted state. And for everything this splendid sidescroller demands of your abilities, it rewards you tenfold with astounding sights, enlivening sounds, and a warming sense of accomplishment. Patience, pattern recognition, and raw twitch reflexes are practically prerequisites, but those who take on the challenge will find that Cuphead stands tall among the best 2D shooters of all time.Cuphead and Mugman, I should say. Our two demitasse-domed heroes made the mistake of gambling their souls at the Devil's casino, and must pay off their debt by besting the many bosses who reside on Inkwell Isle. Right from the title screen, Cuphead douses you in its charm, greeting you with an adorable animation and a barbershop quartet crooning about the beverage-brained brothers' current predicament. Few games capture a distinct medium and mood as well as Cuphead, which channels every aspect of cartoons from the 1930s, in the vein of Fleischer Studios' Betty Boop shorts and Disney's Silly Symphonies. ""Cuphead's presentation pops in every imaginable way""Faithfully hand-drawn, painstakingly cel-animated characters bounce gleefully with each frame, flashing toothy smiles that range from cheery to dastardly. The gorgeous watercolor backdrops are on par with those in Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, unveiling a stunning wealth of detail upon closer inspection (provided you can rip your attention away from the lavishly animated action). And the soundtrack is an absolute hoot, bursting with jazzy big band numbers and sprightly ragtime ditties. Perhaps it was the high of finally downing some particularly tough bosses, but the tune accompanying the post-fight victory screen often had me jauntily snapping my fingers to the beat like a man possessed (opens in new tab).  The '30s throwbacks pervade every last detail. Load screens clue you into the persistent visual filter that replicates the look of a vintage film reel, backed by the comforting white noise of a vinyl record's distinct crackle. Everyone speaks in booming, echoey, distant-sounding voices - from the snouted shopkeeper at Porkrinder's Emporium, to your co-op buddy bellowing ""Thaaank you!"" whenever you rescue them - akin to the unforgettable ""Don't you believe it! (opens in new tab)"" bit from classic Tom and Jerry. Dialogue during the brief bits of story include multiple exclamations of ""Golly!"" and ""Hot dawg!"" Cuphead's presentation pops in every imaginable way, and the old-school cartoon stylings pair beautifully with the retro 16-bit era gameplay. ""We quit our jobs, remortgaged our houses"" - how relentless passion made Cuphead a reality (opens in new tab)You should think of Cuphead as a series of increasingly difficult boss fights, though there are a small handful of platforming ""Run & Gun"" levels mixed in. Each encounter pits you (and a friend, in two-player couch co-op) against a larger-than-life opponent with an entirely unique set of attacks, cues, and weak points. Fights tend to take under three minutes, but that's usually after you've carefully studied your enemy's multiple phases over the course of many, many failures. This is the kind of game where, once you've gotten your bearings, any early damage you take should probably default to a quick, painless retry. Progress is only palpable through your rising skill: there are no checkpoints, no mid-battle health pickups, and no methods for cheesing through a fair fight. All you can depend on are your wits, reflexes, infinite lives, and the tightly tuned controls. Cuphead's handling is so intuitive that before long, quick-dodge dashing, eight-way firing, and jump-parries that nullify any attack color-coded pink (which quickly becomes crucial to your success) will feel like second nature.Classic inspirations are apparent all throughout Cuphead, with callbacks to genre godfathers like Mega Man, Contra, Metal Slug, and Gunstar Heroes - but always with some unique twist, elevating their designs above nostalgic mimicry. Every imaginative encounter tests your skills in some surprising, rousing new way - including welcome shmup skirmishes that keep things varied, as you blast your adversaries in an adorable biplane that can shrink to make dodging a teensy bit easier. If you've collected enough coins from the brief, far-less-difficult Run & Gun stages, you can purchase additional weapons and passive boosts to hone your playstyle - and every powerup has its place. I was certain I had equipped the only two weapons I would ever need, only to find that all six flavors of firing had their time to shine against certain bosses.Never did I feel frustrated by Cuphead, even after repeatedly failing on the last smidgen of a boss' health bar (which is only visible after your death). No boss felt insurmountable, like some brick wall I'd be slamming my head against until I scraped out a desperate win. Cuphead's peppy, immaculate presentation just has this way of soothing any mounting slipups like some invigorating salve; even the quippy taunts that bosses spout whenever you die brought many a giddy smile to my face. And when you finally do triumph over a trickier boss, oh, what a feeling. Victory is always well-earned, whether you're cutting your teeth on the Simple difficulty or entering the Regular ring (which you'll have to step up to if you want to finish the game - and unlock the boss-amping Expert mode). ""I'm mighty excited for an Expert encore""There's also a pleasant amount of metagame to explore within the Inkwell Isles. The overworld is rife with secrets and creative methods of progress: you can seek out new pathways to take on an area's five bosses in a flexible order, NPCs give you optional quests via cryptic clues, and coins and shortcuts are hidden out of sight. It's a bit strange, then, that there aren't a few more amenities thrown in that the modern player might be expecting. You're graded after each stage, but you have no easy way to check your records, and there aren't any leaderboards to see where you stand. At launch, local is the only way to co-op play (though there are plans to add online later). But these all feel like minor gripes in a complete package where even the smallest feature was crafted with care. Heck, the Devil's second-in-command, King Dice, has an entire song dedicated to him - which only plays in tiny, combat-free rooms that most players will cruise right on through. That kind of ancillary-but-appreciated effort reminds me of Skullmonkeys' ""Little Bonus Room (opens in new tab)"" song that's near and dear to my heart.Yes, Cuphead was worth the wait. Too often, I find myself thinking ""Thank God I never have to do that again"" after wrapping up a difficult game - but with Cuphead, I'm mighty excited to further my eight-to-nine-hour Regular run by trouncing those bosses in an Expert encore. If you're partial to a tough-but-fair challenge, and you have even the slightest appreciation for the rich history of animated cartoons, you'll be overjoyed by the wonderfully artistic adventure that is Cuphead. Maybe you'll even get a blistered thumb or two to remember it by.This game was reviewed on Xbox One.Are you in love with Cuphead's challenge?

Cuphead,Jeff Cork,Game Informer,https://www.gameinformer.com/games/cuphead/b/xboxone/archive/2017/10/02/cuphead-review-tempest-in-a-teacup.aspx,"Cuphead made me shout obscenities at a flower. Its cheerful dragon tempted me to head-butt my television. And the candy princess? Oh, you don’t even want to know. I didn’t appreciate it until much later, but those early maddening hours with Studio MDHR’s run-and-gun platformer were like a kiln, hardening my skills and turning me into the best damned Cuphead player that I could be. That trial by fire is ultimately one of the most satisfying parts of the overall experience, but players who just want to enjoy its unique aesthetic are going to get burned.The hand-drawn animation is mesmerizing, and makes for one of the most visually appealing games I’ve played in years. Studio MDHR faithfully recreated nearly every facet of classic animation from the ‘20s and ‘30s, from the title cards that introduce each stage to the jazzy score that accompanies the action. If you have any fondness for that era, you’re in good hands. Going into the game, I wondered if there would be certain homages to long-lost techniques, and, without spoiling some of the most satisfying little moments of the game, the answer is “Yep!” The attention to detail is wonderful, and I was immediately pulled into its scratchy Technicolor world. But once I got there, I was in for a surprise.
 
Cuphead may lure you close like the visible aroma from a cartoon pie, but its difficulty is the windowsill slamming shut on your hands. Studio MDHR was inspired not only by classic animation, but by tough arcade games that fed off a steady diet of quarters. The bulk of Cuphead is built around boss battles, each of which has several different phases. They can be knocked out in a couple of minutes, but that assumes you’ve mastered the various tricks each one requires. You have unlimited continues, but no checkpoints or shortcuts through the encounters. When you fail – and you will fail – you have to fight that boss from its opening moments again. This approach walks the razor-thin balance beam between being frustrating and rewarding, and it mostly succeeds. About half the time I finally landed the final blow on a boss, I’d cheer. The other times, I’d flip it the bird with both hands. You can play simplified versions of the boss fights, but you won’t get to see many of the game’s best moments. You also need to beat them on the regular difficulty if you want to fight the last pair of bosses. Trust me, it’s worth it.Compared to the intense boss encounters, the run-and-gun action levels feel uninspired, full of straightfoward enemy gauntlets and platforming challenges. These sections aren't nearly as interesting as the rest of the game, and include some of Cuphead’s worst moments, such as a poorly implemented gravity-swapping section and a few fatal end-of-stage surprises that feel more like active trolling. Unfortunately, they’re the main source of gold coins, which you need to buy additional weapons and special abilities. Fortunately, these levels aren't numerous, and you never have to revisit them once you get all the coins.Those weapons and abilities add a welcome wrinkle to Cuphead. You can equip two weapon types, one of three ultimate attacks, and a special charm. At first, I gravitated toward abilities that gave me additional health. Then I got better at the game and found that I wasn’t getting hit nearly as often. At that point, I switched to a power that let me avoid damage by dashing, and that changed everything. The arsenal is small but diverse, and part of the fun is finding a loadout that works best for you. On several occasions, when I thought a boss was impossible, I breezed through it after picking the right tools. Getting good at the parry ability, which allows you to slap away pink projectiles, is also key. When I got stuck, I enlisted help through local co-op. By bringing along a buddy (who plays as Cuphead’s friend, Mugman), you can revive your comrade if you manage to parry their ghost before it floats to the top of the screen. I thought this would be overpowered, but it comes with a tradeoff: Sharing space with another character can be distracting, especially when you need to watch out for subtle tells that the bosses have before attacking. I got through some tricky stages thanks to co-op, but I managed to beat the rest of it solo, so assistance isn't a requirement.Cuphead is a singular experience. Studio MDHR knew what it wanted to make, then went ahead and made it. A tough boss-rush game based on classic animation archetypes? It shouldn’t work, but here we are. It’s fun to play, and possibly even as satisfying to watch, since you can fully absorb what’s going on screen. It would have been easy to dial down the overall difficulty (and I wouldn’t have complained), but that wouldn’t have been Cuphead, either. Stick with it, is all I can say. We don't often get something that will make you laugh and grind your teeth in such close proximity.

   on April 18, 2019 at 8:15AM PDTEverything you've heard about Cuphead is true. It is a difficult side-scrolling shooter with relentless boss battles that demand rapid-fire actions and reactions. Think for too long, and you won't stand a chance against the game's toughest enemies. Battles may only last three minutes at most, but they feel far longer when you know that you can only absorb three hits before you have to start from scratch. When you are navigating your way around bullets, smaller enemies, and pitfalls, while simultaneously trying to damage your primary target, toppling Cuphead's imposing bosses is both a monumental and rewarding task.But difficult battles only tell half of the story. Cuphead's 1930s cartoon aesthetic is endlessly charming, popping with color and expression unlike anything seen at this scale in a video game before. And now that it's available on Switch, you can get a closer look and admire the artwork in the palm of your hand. The sheer variety of characters and settings yields consistent delight as you go from one stage to the next, with everything bearing the telltale signs of grainy film and rudimentary production techniques. Cel-shading means one thing to a lot of people, but Cuphead truly re-creates the look of hand-drawn cel animation.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

Never mind that Betty's lookalike is a mermaid now; it's the moment her head breaks free from her body and spews caustic skulls that gives you pause. If you can appreciate the unique animation style, you will be doubly impressed when you see what developer Studio MDHR has brought to the table. If its technical execution wasn't enough, MDHR's creativity puts Cuphead in a league of its own.A world map sets the stage for your adventure. As a Cup-thing who gambled with the devil, you now must go around collecting debts from the devil's other acquaintances--the game's bosses. Outside of one-on-one fights, you also have a few opportunities to run and gun through less-imposing platforming stages. These help break up the action and give you a chance to collect coins that can be cashed in for ""weapons"" and passive buffs. Coins are in short supply and can only be collected once, so farming to gain an advantage is out of the question. These stages don't compare to Cuphead's main attractions, but they add valuable substance nonetheless.The mix of ammunition for your handgun--character fire from their fingers--includes the likes of a spread shot, a charge blast, and a boomerang round. There are six in all, and each comes with a secondary attack that's tied to a meter that fills when you successfully land shots on enemies. You can also earn meter by parrying pink projectiles and enemies, a task that requires you to jump towards an enemy and then tap jump again at just the right moment before impact. These range from a fireball and a ring of damaging gems to a burst of bulky, short-range arrows. Finally, you have a super art, which can only be fired when your entire meter is full, as opposed to spending one section of that meter to fire your weapon's secondary attack. The one catch here is that when your meter is full, you can't perform a secondary attack--you are inconveniently forced to unleash your super art, which isn't always desirable.Given that you are able to equip two weapons at once, the variety of loadouts you can equip before a fight allows for flexibility on your part. While you may benefit by bringing a specific set of arms into some boss battles--say, using tracer rounds to pick off minor enemies swarming overhead--you can still carry whatever you wish into battle so long as you have the confidence and knowledge meet the challenge ahead.Learning the bosses' attack pattern is oftentimes half the battle, and it's typical to run through a fight multiple times until you see everything that might get thrown your way. Every boss fight consists of multiple stages or forms. Bosses will change shape, position, and behavior with each new phase. And within an individual phase, you may see as many as four different attacks, though you aren't always guaranteed to see them all during subsequent fights. When bosses begin to mix multiple attacks at once, the potential for various deadly combos keeps you on your toes no matter how familiar you are with the fight in question.The fear of the unexpected is part of what makes Cuphead such a thrilling game, beyond the frantic moment-to-moment tension. You only have three hit points per stage by default--you gain a fourth if you equip a charm that also weakens your firepower. But when the only question in your head is, ""In what order will the boss' attacks appear?"" fights take on less-appealing light after the dozenth attempt. It's in these moments you start to identify a few places where Cuphead could do a slightly better job of keeping you informed of your own progress and capabilities.You never can tell exactly how close to death--or a phase change, for that matter--bosses are. At best, you can see a plotline of the battle after death, to loosely gauge your relative progress. In the face of defeat, you may begin to question if you're carrying the right tools for the job. Beyond revisiting old fights, which is more arduous than it should be as you traverse the map slowly and can't fast travel, there isn't a great way to familiarize yourself with new weapons. And there's, unfortunately, no way to tell exactly how much damage one weapon does compared to another. Vague descriptions are all you get.If Cuphead's fights were indeed puzzles with one correct solution, this would be incredibly frustrating. As it stands, there's only a small amount of frustration to be found while fumbling with new weapons and dying in the process. It may sound like a minor thing to praise, but the fact that boss battles reload in one or two seconds is a godsend when it comes to trial-and-error tactics. And no matter how frustrating a boss may be, you can't escape the draw of their expressive animations.Cuphead does support two-player local co-op as well but it's pretty evident that this makes life more difficult for you and your partner. Despite the intricate chaos that you face alone in any given fight, when you add another character and more projectiles on screen, playing with a friend makes it far more difficult to discern your surroundings, and much easier to slip up. You do have a small window of time to revive a fallen comrade by parrying their ghost, but it's a mere few seconds while it floats up to the top of the screen before disappearing for the remainder of the fight.For anyone interested in getting a taste of Cuphead without facing almost-guaranteed defeat, there are simpler versions of every boss that you can fight--but you won't be able to access the final battle unless you beat every standard boss on the normal difficulty. And in reality, you may as well stick with the standard fights as Cuphead is relentless no matter how you play.Cuphead has been a longtime coming, and it's great to see that it lives up to its initial promises across all platforms. It's beautiful to look at, and with a pitch-perfect soundtrack, it flawlessly captures the era its developers so clearly revere. It's also an intense action game that pulls no punches. It could benefit from a few tweaks, and two-player co-op doesn't feel like the valuable addition you might imagine, but Cuphead remains a rare, unique game that truly stands out.Cuphead is featured on our list of the best Xbox co-op games as well as the Best Xbox Games for Kids.Editor's note (April 18, 2019): The review text and score have been updated to reflect the Switch version of Cuphead, which looks and plays just as well as other versions of the game--with a few new touches that will soon be applied to other platforms.

Cuphead,Chris Plante,Polygon,https://www.polygon.com/2017/9/29/16381614/cuphead-review-xbox-one-windows-pc,"Filed under:Despite its reputation as a difficult game, Cuphead generously teaches players to become expertsCuphead has a reputation for being difficult, so let’s clarify this up top: Cuphead isn’t impossible; it isn’t the Dark Souls of 2D shooters, nor is it the world’s cutest bullet-hell game; it isn’t even particularly punishing. For a game that has established an identity around an “old-school” (read: hard) design, Cuphead is unexpectedly accessible. Announced in the summer of 2014, Cuphead cultivated a fandom around its art style, an homage to 1930s cartoons from Disney and Fleischer Studios. Brothers Chad and Jared Moldenhauer, along with animator Jake Clark, meshed the hand-drawn art with the run-and-gun genre popularized by pixelated games like Mega Man. The result is a throwback on a throwback, an ode to the good old days of games and animation alike.

  Shrewdly, the creators lanced many of the warts that have festered on the “good old days” of both forms. Gone are both the technical limitations of classic games and, more importantly, the grotesque racist caricature of classic cartoons. Cuphead’s creators have emulated how we remember our nostalgic darlings, rather than how they actually exist today.And that’s why I say Cuphead shouldn’t be missed because of preconceptions about difficulty (barring, perhaps, the finale, which I’ll get to shortly). It borrows ideas from games like Ikaruga and Gunstar Heroes, but it’s fine if you aren’t familiar with either of those. While it’s a game about battling overpowered enemies, Cuphead shares more with puzzle games, although it requires healthy reflexes, patience and, above all, a willingness to learn.Cuphead is the story of an adorable cup that makes a deal with the devil, then has to repay a debt by collecting the contracts of the devil’s other debtors. Satan’s debtors amount to a few dozen stand-alone boss fights, which must be completed so dear Cuphead can save his soul. You (and optionally, a friend in local co-op) travel from one boss to the next, unleashing infinite ammunition into their eyeballs, tummies, appendages or other vulnerable spots until they submit. All the while, you dodge increasingly complex patterns of attacks.The average boss fight in Cuphead, from beginning to end, is roughly two minutes long; short enough to be tested over and over and over again. Fights are themselves divided into a few phases, and each phase introduces its own new set of challenges (such as a tall wave of bullets) that inspire tiny epiphanies (rather than jump over the bullets, duck). Strung together to complete a stage, these self-taught lessons produce a real sense of accomplishment. It’s chemical. I do not fist-pump while playing games. I do not whoop. Cuphead had me doing both, while yelping “I did it!” to my very confused and indifferent dog.Cuphead, at its best, educates the player on how to overcome each obstacle. Every boss fight has an ideal strategy discovered through trial and error. To avoid stress, it’s helpful to think of failure as a greater tool than any weapon. When a Medusa-like boss froze me in midair, I eventually found the spot to hide from her icy stare. After a ghastly horseman uppercutted me into oblivion, I knew to keep an eye on the bottom of the screen so I could spot him preparing a strike. With each round against a boss, I found myself progressing further, not because I was becoming some prodigious video game guru, but because I merely spotted and memorized each stone on the walkway to victory.All of this is possible because of one crucial component: consistency.Parrying — hopping into attacks, then bouncing off them at the last moment — is a crucial and relatively forgiving mechanic in Cuphead, not requiring the superhuman timing of fighting games that feature a similar move. In some ways, I enjoyed the parrying system more than Cuphead’s various attacks. Only pink objects can be parried, and they change between levels, often blending into the scene. In one stage, they are dice skittering across a casino craps table; in another, they’re tears raining from a ghoulish pair of eyes. Finding the parry-able objects can become a game of recon, sending Cuphead into a fight not to win, but to spot the path to victory for a rematch. Tucked into the game are three mausoleum stages in which Cuphead can only extinguish ghosts with parries, sending the little goober bouncing across the screen, bopping one ghost after the other. It’s a lovely palate-cleanser, and I hope to see more of these missions in future expansions.The game isn’t designed for true gamers to race through with nothing but raw skill and unearned confidence. If anything, the boss fights punish pride, filling stages with minions, projectiles and traps. Where Cuphead scolds speed, it rewards a careful and thoughtful method. Anytime the challenge feels too great, a solution can typically be found by inhaling, exhaling and carefully considering all possible solutions before diving back into the fight.Cuphead unlocks new weapons and abilities rapidly, allowing for further experimentation in pursuit of the optimal way to beat any given boss. In a fight, Cuphead can carry two weapons, a bonus power and a special attack at all times. A thoughtful loadout can impact the difficulty of a stage. For example, a stage with swarms of enemies benefits from a powerful short-range attack, a buff that automatically accumulates special attacks and a screen-clearing super move. Meanwhile, a humongous boss who fires large projectiles calls for homing bullets, a buff that prevents damage while dodging and a special move that grants brief invincibility.Loadout weapons and buffs can purchased with coins hidden throughout a handful of platforming stages. To be clear, Cuphead isn’t a platformer. A few side-scrolling moments have been added for flavor, but where boss fights teach players the unique method with which to clear each fight, these traditional stages are largely completed through brute force, killing everything on screen, pressing forward until the finish line. Classic video game boss fights have fallen out of favor in the past couple of decades, and one wonders if these bits of platforming were added to ground intimidated players in something more familiar. Sadly, there’s no better reminder of why video games have largely scrapped the classic boss fight than the final two battles in Cuphead. The first is a gauntlet of bosses, between three and nine, along with a bonus boss. And the final ... well, I won’t go into details, but it felt like a battle with the game itself. Cuphead has an astonishing cohesion: a stunning orchestral soundtrack and visual confidence that reminds me of my favorite Ub Iwerks cartoons. But on occasion, those elements get in the way — particularly the art, which can obscure the foreground, concealing enemies and projectiles. Sometimes the part of an enemy that can be touched without taking damage is unclear. The final fights combine both of these problems, and what should feel like a culmination of a learned expertise winds up requiring a mastery of the game’s idiosyncrasies — with help from luck. The conclusion of Cuphead is, I fear, what the game has broadly been perceived as: a comically difficult, if not cruel, experience. And that’s really a shame, because the lion’s share of Cuphead is a special formula that takes a notoriously challenging genre of the past and carefully and lovingly introduces it to the wider audience it deserves.

  Cuphead’s deal with the devil eventually leads to hell, and so perhaps it’s fitting the conclusion should be so torturous. Though, honestly, even the residual headache has been soothed by the sweet, sweet salve of victory. When I think of my time with Cuphead, instead of frustration I’ll remember the dozens of tiny breakthroughs, when the impossible became possible, and a game that built an identity around difficulty helped me to feel, however briefly, undefeatable. Cuphead was reviewed using a final “retail” downloadable Xbox Play Anywhere code provided by Microsoft, and the game was played exclusively on a Windows 10 PC.

Take one look at the game in motion, and you’ll see why. Cuphead combines brutal, precision platforming action with an exceptionally well realized artistic style to create one of the most enjoyable video game experiences I’ve ever had.Cuphead is an action-platformer in the style of games like Gunstar Heroes. Your basic abilities will have you running, shooting, and dashing around to dodge projectiles and enemies while damaging foes. Most of the game’s levels are static boss fights. These fights, when done correctly, are short and typically range from 90 seconds to three minutes. The key phrase here is “done correctly,” because the fun of Cuphead comes from its punishing difficulty.Rather than upgrading your character with loot and deep skill trees, getting good at Cuphead is all about mastering the relatively simple controls. The most “technical” the game gets is when it comes to its unique parry system. Any pink object in the world, from enemies, to projectiles, to the nose on a vicious roller coaster, can be parried, or double-jumped off of, in other words--keeping you safe and adding a bar to your super meter. It’s a system that is easy to learn and helpful for beating bosses more quickly early on, and becomes vital for survival in later levels of the game.In addition to standard pea shooter, Cuphead also has five weapons, that can be unlocked by collecting currency. Each of the weapons has their own advantages and disadvantages, and any two can be brought into each level and swapped with the push of a button. These weapons include a homing shot that deals reduced damage, a spread shot with short range, and my personal favorite a charge shot in the style of Mega Man. You can also equip one passive charm, which can give you abilities like a gradually increasing super meter or an invincible and invisible dash.Where Cuphead truly sets itself apart from other similar games is in its art style. Cuphead looks, sounds like, and most importantly feels like you’re playing a 1930s American cartoon, specifically in the style of early Disney. The titular character, as well as his accomplice Mugman, even both resemble Mickey Mouse himself.That’s not to say that the game is just a cheap rip-off, though. Each of the bosses feels truly inspired. The very first boss is a prime example of what to expect. At first, Goopy LeGrande is just a villainous slime whose only form of attack is to jump on you or form into a fist and lunge at you. He grows angry, and halfway through the battle takes a pill that makes him larger. He’s faster, bigger, and more dangerous. After dealing with this second form, the slime “dies,” and his third and final form--the giant vengeful tombstone of Goopy LeGrande--drops on the field and attempts to crush Cuphead, because that’s all he ever knew in life. Every boss almost tells a story just through its transformations. I’m still blown away when I see footage of all the bosses, even the most frustrating ones who were responsible for dozens of my deaths and hours of gameplay wasted.These fixed-perspective boss fights make up a little more than half the game. The other playable levels of Cuphead are airborne shooters and “run-and-gun” levels. The plane battles play like boss fights from shoot-em-ups, using the same basic controls (parrying, super moves) of the platforming levels, but instead of swapping to a second weapon you can turn into a more mobile mini-plane. These levels can be some of the most difficult in the game, as the focus is much more on precise movement than usual. Run-and-gun levels play like the boss fights, but with a focus on dealing with smaller enemies and platforming. They feel like they could be longer, but are so dense with amazing art and enemy design that I had fun replaying them multiple times just to improve my rank.Despite its inviting art style, Cuphead is not a game for everyone. It’s extremely difficult, and you might not think that the definition of fun is playing the same levels over and over again. There is also one major issue in the parry system. People with certain types of colorblindness may not be able to know at first glance which items are pink and can be parried. There are boss fights where it is almost mandatory that you do some parrying, and the fact that there is no colorblind mode may make it difficult for these people to beat the game. It feels like most video games have implemented colorblind modes, even when it is not imperative, so the lack of one in Cuphead stands out.If you’re the type of person who derives joy from angrily banging your head into a boss over and over until you can perfectly defeat it in the most glorious 90 seconds you will ever experience, then Cuphead is the total package. The tight gameplay, accompanied by an incredibly well-realized aesthetic, makes for a truly unforgettable gameplay experience.

Cuphead,Heather Alexandra,Kotaku,https://kotaku.com/cuphead-the-kotaku-review-1818998781,"Cuphead turns players into perfectionists. The long-awaited hand-drawn action game is full of cartoony boss battles that demand enough precision and focus that even a single hit of damage feels unacceptable. Playing Cuphead is like a stage performance; every mistake is embarrassing, but the curtain call of each defeated boss is like nothing else.This piece was first published on September 29, 2017. We’re bumping it today for the game’s release on the Nintendo Switch.The game looks like an old cartoon from the early 20th century and has a simple story to go with it. It features a small anthropomorphic cup and his mug buddy as they fight a horde of villains in order to avoid having their souls collected by the devil. Each fight plays out like an extended version of blasty action games like the iconic side-scroller Contra or the famously-tough Ikaruga. The game’s multi-phase bosses fill the screen with fire, smash the scenery with wrecking balls, and dotting the skies with a hail of bullets. Throughout it all, Cuphead and his pal Mugman must shoot their way to victory and collect souls for the devil lest he take their own.Cuphead, developed by StudioMDHR, was announced in 2014 and has drawn eyes for its graphics while generating animated debate about its difficulty. It is true that the game’s various boss encounters often provide a challenge, but they rarely feel unfair. Cuphead is mostly about pattern recognition and reading your opponent. Bosses start with simple attacks before ramping up their ferocity as their health is depleted. In their final throes they may summon extra minions or they may start a new pattern of attacks that requires intense concentration to dodge. All of this provides a lovely challenge that turns each victory into an intoxicating drug. You will die plenty in the game. I struggled for an hour with one boss, but victory seldom feels unattainable and the game’s ramp of challenges is mostly smooth. Things get rougher in the final segment, which includes a lengthy boss rush. The good news is that if things ever feel too difficult, there’s always the option to play cooperatively with another player.Successful boss fights only last two or three minutes but the technical precision required to find victory is intense. As you become more accustomed to enemies, you begin to see the flaws in your performance. You’ll notice that the giant fish monster’s bubble attacks circle in alternative rotations that you were ignoring. You’ll realize you missed a weak spot on the mad doctor’s robot. You’ll realize you should have been switching weapons and fared better as a result. If you’re a bit cheeky, you might even find a spot to stand where you’ll always avoid a major attack. Health is precious in this game. Bosses require hundreds of hits to die, but you’ll expire in just a few. When you die, a percentage bar shows you just how close you were to victory; there were a few times I was just moments away from victory if not for stupid mistakes early on. This makes it intolerable to lose health early in a boss fight. Not only does it rob you of precious hit points, but taking damage feels like a personal shame. There were many times I restarted battles immediately because I mistimed a jump or moved a few pixels too close to a boss and took avoidable damage. The game wants perfection and I played into the early morning hours until I delivered.""A brawl is surely brewing!""Magic TrickGorgeous style, intense and difficult boss battlesSome levels feel tacked on, a few bosses have cheap attacksStudioMDHRXbox One, PC (Crossplayed on both)September 29th, 20179 hours of cartoon delightCuphead is tough, but it is also generous in how much say players are given in how they’ll fare. The game provides many options for customizing your playstyle. Cuphead can equip different attacks such as a wide but close ranged spread of bullets or a lobbed attack that is slow but powerful. Players can also purchase and equip various charms that add extra health or grant invincibility while dashing also equalize the playing field. A small portion of the game involves running through levels fighting enemies, basic side-scroller stuff. Climb up a tree of angry birds, blast through the wacky carnival. In those sections, Cuphead bends to the player’s will, letting you choose a rhythm and cadence that suits your playstyle and customization choices. This is true for many of the game’s boss fights as well. But two boss fights that involve jumping from platform to platform painfully put players at the mercy of the developer’s rules and rhythms. In these sections, platform patterns sometimes seem random, making it all too easy to feel a loss of control and fall into a pit that seemingly couldn’t be avoided.Playing the game and nailing all your movements can feel like putting on a concert. You run and you shoot and you very much must parry. That last one is key. By batting away the projectiles or enemies, players can nullify damage while also launching Cuphead to new heights. Learning to use this mechanic is critical to surviving larger attacks or finding enough space to dodge. When it all combines, Cuphead feels like a raucous piece of orchestration with each movement, parry, and special attack a notable punctuation. Weaving these actions together isn’t always about victory, it’s about style. Succeed in the task and you’ve created something wonderful. A well executed boss fight is a thing of beauty you want to share with the world.Of course, the game is also gorgeous to look at. Cuphead takes up a hand drawn art-style evocative of early Disney or Max Fleischer cartoon and is simply delightful to watch. It can occasionally get overwhelming to keep track of the action but every single frame of Cuphead feels like a loving tribute to the bouncy days of Steamboat Willie and Felix the Cat. The art is complemented by catchy music full of plonky piano claps and boisterous brass. It’s hard to get frustrated at the game’s tougher moments when everything on screen brims with personality.Cuphead was originally presented in preview events as a game full of boss battles, with little to play between them. That changed as the game was under development. The finished work has small platforming levels to rush through and locations to clear but they never manage to form a cohesive connective tissues between the boss battles. Occasionally, they will add twists such as changing gravity but these levels mostly feel like gimmicks. Without the added tension of a relentless battle, these flourishes seem misplaced. They’re pretty, but they’re filler and the game would have been stronger, if more brief, without them. It seems that the developers know how disposable these levels are. They let you skip them, though doing so might mean losing out on extra coins to purchase upgrades. The levels dazzle in the moment before fading to the background.Cuphead feels a bit like a good magic trick. The experience is brief and so artistically impressive that it’s hard to believe it’s happening before your eyes. The game has one of the most memorable art styles in years and turns every moment into a picture-perfect display of cartoon merriment. But this is more than just an eye-catching game. Cuphead is all about the big fights and the feeling you get from winning them. It’s delightful and fun and worth the effort it’ll take to clear."

CUPHEAD REVIEW FOR PS4. Cuphead might have been left on the stove for quite some time after its surprise E3 2014 appearance, but it came out at the perfect temperature when it finally released in 2017. The difficult bosses were satisfying to topple and the 1930s-esque art style never wore out its welcome. And after its venture to the Switch, it has finally made its way to the PS4, despite Studio MDHR adamantly stating the opposite a few years ago. The Cuphead PS4 version isn’t a grand new repackaging of the tough platformer, but is a faithful representation of it.Cuphead‘s gameplay and presentation — its two core tenets — are essentially untouched, but didn’t need any sort of upgrades in that department. Its Fleischer-inpsired art is built to withstand the test of time as it still looks fantastic almost a century later. Cuphead is obviously more colorful than those cartoons and has some of the most exaggerated and expressive animation when compared to its 2D peers.Enemies are both wondrously creative and impeccably drawn and haven’t lost a bit of their charm since the game’s initial release. Even though some have tried (and failed), there was nothing like it then and there’s still nothing like it now as it remains an inventive mix of old animation and pure ingenuity. Foes bounce from one unexpected form to the next to maintain a healthy sense of visual and gameplay unpredictability — a facet that is further emphasized by the random patterns of many bosses. Pattern recognition can best a few of the big bads, but plenty of them change up their tactics each time and require that you master the mechanics and not absentmindedly fall into mundane grooves.Cuphead is mainly made up of these boss rush stages where your only objective is to defeat that one giant enemy in front of you. Projectiles often fill the screen as you carefully weave through them to land blows of your own. Each takes a fair bit of skill and concentration to fell and many of them will make quick work of your porcelain ass if your finger twitches incorrectly or your mind wanders for a brief second. But the smooth and responsive controls mean that you’ll never get to blame the game, just your poor reflexes.Quickly loading back in keeps frustration at a low and when combined with the fluid mechanics, Cuphead is a hard game and a hard game to put down especially as the catchy soundtrack wonderfully matches and heightens the game’s frenetic pace. Dodging through bullet-filled screens that would make Ikaruga blush is mentally taxing though, meaning that you’re more likely to stop playing out of exhaustion than out of rage. Hitting such a nexus of fair and challenging is admirable and one of the key reasons Cuphead doesn’t grow stale and remains immensely gratifying throughout. It pushes you to work harder and rewards you intrinsically for coming out on top.Cuphead isn’t stale even though it is identical to its predecessors. There’s no new content and the game still doesn’t support any sort of crossplay or online multiplayer. It’s a mere port with the faster load times of the patched Xbox One original that still outshine the Switch installment (although every platform outperforms the game’s 2017 launch load times). While that Switch installment was portable and an impressive translation, the newer PS4 counterpart doesn’t have anything to add since it is just another way to play the game.While another extras-focused update is planned (however, it’s unclear if it is coming to non-Xbox platforms), it would have been ideal if this launch fixed some of the game’s small but persistent issues. The run-and-gun levels do change up the pacing, but are still underwhelming as they feel like mods that put the mechanics in situations they aren’t as equipped to handle. More flexible aiming would also help both the run-and-gun and regular boss levels as being locked to specific angles can be frustrating. And even though its difficulty is part of the charm, it still lacks decent accessibility options. None of these problems rob Cuphead of its prestige status, but addressing these would benefit every version and better welcome in this new port.Cuphead is likely to be an unforgettable experience no matter what is played on. There’s a fundamental charm to the game that still remains unique as it goes from platform to platform. Its boss fights and art style are consistent highlights and almost completely override some of its minute inconsistencies that are still present here. The Cuphead PS4 port may not bring anything new to the table, but it’s still the prettiest chalice on it.GameRevolution reviewed Cuphead on PS4.

Cuphead,Brett Makedonski,Destructoid,https://www.destructoid.com/review-cuphead-463873.phtml,"darkBeating Cuphead should come with a complimentary Mensa membership. It’s a tough game, but Cuphead‘s difficulty lies more in exhaustive pattern recognition than anywhere else. Reactive shooting and jumping only go so far. Eventually, it’s hardly reactionary anymore; it’s muscle memory at that point.There’s a cognitive brilliance about Cuphead that makes it more rewarding than most other platformer shooters. There’s a process to every single fight: Introduction, dissection, analysis, execution. Liberally sprinkle in failure at each step. No one is going to stumble into success in Cuphead. Every victory is earned. Every victory is sweet.Cuphead (PC [reviewed], Xbox One)Developer: StudioMDHR EntertainmentPublisher: StudioMDHR EntertainmentReleased: September 29, 2017MSRP: $19.99Cuphead tells the story of the eponymous protagonist who’s up to his straw in gambling debts. Making matters worse: The devil is the bookie. The only way out of this is for Cuphead to act as an aggressive collection agency, fighting everyone else who owes the devil money until they pay up.The structure of Cuphead is such that it rarely wastes time on lesser encounters. Most games would focus on how and where we find these bums; Cuphead foregoes the hunt in favor of delivering us right to these deadbeats. Essentially, it’s a series of boss encounters — each and every one legitimately different and special and memorable. The sentient teacup is eventually and inevitably outshone by the likes of a gigantic flower, an evil carnival ride, and a feisty Broadway actress.Thematically, Cuphead is all over the place. There’s a cohesion in the stunning 1930s-era aesthetic (and the accompanying jazz soundtrack which is similarly fabulous) but most of the enemies don’t have much in common with each other. That’s okay, though! They’re consistently presented as independent challenges and besting any one of them feels like an event. They don’t necessarily need to be linked except by virtue of the fact that they’re all debtors.Actually, the game probably benefits from this variation. It affords Cuphead an opportunity of sorts, the chance to get wildly imaginative in whatever way it possibly can. This potential is made good on time and time again in the multi-stage battles. Each boss becomes more and more intimidating as time goes on — not only by their more-powerful tactics, but also by their physical transformations. There’s a progression to each fight that’s equal parts logical and beautiful.There’s an easy-to-ignore animation after every failed attempt that eventually comes to define the Cuphead experience. It’s a silhouetted bar that indicates how close to the end you came. Rarely will a dedicated player find themselves backtracking on that bar in subsequent tries. Every section is a hurdle of randomized patterns, and that hurdle will only be cleared through understanding and learning. Once you finally make a breakthrough, it’s suddenly not tough to replicate that success.The key, at least at first, is to understand your own abilities before understanding what the enemies are capable of. It’s obfuscated to some extent, but the dash and parry maneuvers are just as important as the shooting. Cuphead has deceptively tight platforming mechanics, something that’s not likely to be noticed until you angle through a particularly hazardous spot. It feels more natural than it looks.This is a necessity because Cuphead‘s reliance on platforming is greater than it seems. For all the colorful bullet-hell shooting that happens, there’s constant jumping and dodging that’s even more important. It’s an unending offensive barrage, sure, but its backbone is keen defensive play. Yin and yang.Supplementing all of this is a glut of skills to choose from. I’m hesitant to call them upgrades because they really aren’t. They’re mostly just different from one another and some even come with drawbacks. For instance, one shot type is long distance and low damage, while another is medium range with good damage but a lowered fire rate; the charms — which are more passive abilities — have options like an extra life at the cost of decreased damage, or an automatic parry after a jump. (Parries are particularly important. Executing one on a pink enemy substantially fills the meter for Ex and Super attacks.)It’s a lot to keep track of, which perfectly mirrors how every battle has a lot to keep track of. There are so many actions on the screen at all times, and it can be overwhelming. Everything makes sense though. All enemy attacks are telegraphed in some way. You just have to know what to look out for. Easier said than done, especially when you’re staying cautious of, like, three different attacks. Cuphead‘s always fair, though. Tough but fair.Armed with that knowledge, going on the offensive is less about brute force and more about strategic movement. It’s easy to hit the opponent. It’s harder to hit them from a place where you’re not at risk. This is theoretically possible from most anywhere. Cuphead has an eight-direction firing radius, and it’s the weakest system in the game. Locked down with a button hold, it’s included for shooting in any direction. However, it’s always clunky and awkward. Attacks like the split shot spread out to cover several directions at once, and that feels like a better way to approach complicated situations.The likely reason that there isn’t 360-degree aiming is probably because Cuphead was designed without the controller’s right stick in mind. The default bindings are confounding and ridiculous. Jump, attack, and dash are all set to face buttons, making it unnecessarily prohibitive to do all three in quick succession. (Keep in mind that your finger will hold down the attack button a great majority of the time.) To circumvent this, I assigned dash to the right trigger, freeing my right thumb to only worry about attack and jump. Admittedly, these quibbles are mostly just minor inconveniences.Cuphead‘s incredible style belies its magical complexity. It’s so much more than a hard-as-hell shoot-’em-up with artistic flair. It’s cerebral in a way that these kind of games rarely are. Cuphead‘s commitment to forcing the player to understand is commendable. Those who don’t have the patience to learn won’t get far. That’s the kind of stand-your-ground moxie that makes this a hallmark of game design. My praise runneth over.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]SuperbA hallmark of excellence. There may be flaws, but they are negligible and won't cause massive damage.

Robert Workman 
CUPHEAD became an instant classic when it debuted a year and a half ago for the Xbox One and PC. Studio MDHR’s shoot ’em up romp looked impressive since its unveiling, but playing the final product proved that it had substance to back up its visuals. The team had seamlessly blended the style of 1930s cartoons with hardcore run-and-gun tactics in a way that was truly mesmerizing. The surprise announcement of the Cuphead Switch version made it easy to be skeptical but it’s a fantastic port that has made the transition with its best features intact.In Cuphead, you portray the titular character — or his chummy pal, Mugman — as they make their way to the Devil’s casino. Lucifer makes them an offer they can’t refuse with an attempt to double their money. However, it backfires and leaves the duo helplessly in his debt. Fortunately, he makes them a last-second deal: hunt down debtors that owe him big time, and he’ll spare them. And thus begins a boss-laden journey filled with some rather imaginative battles.Among these include a fight with a large blue Slime-like being that has a knack for wearing a boxing glove; a trio of farm vegetables that don’t give up easily; an actress that sees her whole life pretty much played out on stage as she attempts to kill you, and more. And this is just a handful of the nearly 20 or so creative boss battles that await, each tougher than the last until the challenging finale.But they’re not impossible and overcoming that hump is why they’re so satisfying to slay. Like retro games, there’s a pattern to figure out. Not only that, but pink objects appear in the environment, giving the duo a chance to melee jump off of them and get some extra height and power up their special moves. Along the way, you can also acquire different types of projects including a Contra-esque spread gun, homing bullets, and more as well as useful health boosters.Those bosses are fun to fight as well. Cuphead feels like a classic run-and-gun, so fans of Contra and Gunstar Heroes will be right at home. The action never lets up, and the controls are accurate, even giving you the option to aim in some spots just in case you need to shoot someone above you. It’s smooth, quick, and always does what you want. Dying is frequent but it will probably always be your fault.That said, there should be more run-and-gun levels. There are only three, as the rest of the game dedicated to boss battles. Future DLC might add more of these stages but it was likely that these were difficult to make, which would explain their sparsity. Its boss battles do hold up the game nicely but these traditional levels feel like a full-blown tribute to the good ol’ days that the game could use more of.Its incredible gameplay is matched by its impressive presentation. The graphics pop to life like a wondrous cartoon out of the Steamboat Willie era, its cavalcade of bosses look like they’re just as lively as the main characters, and the backgrounds deliver a sense of wonder unlike anything we’ve ever seen before in the medium. This is easily one of the most imaginatively designed games out there, and it shows in every single frame all the way up to its ending. Cutscenes are even animated now, meaning that it looks better than it did when it came out on the Xbox One and PC.The music also holds up its end of the presentation package. It’s a full-blown orchestration of classic ‘30s themes, and matches the tone of the game splendidly. Each one is catered to particular boss battles. For instance, a dangerous flower is backed by a catchy jazz score, while a pair of boxing frogs get something that revs up as the battle continues on the inside of a club just for bees.Everything about the presentation holds up nicely on the Switch. Even in handheld mode, it looks like fantastic, with nary a hint of slowdown. It’s an impressive feat and a testament to how great art doesn’t always need to run on powerful machines to look great.Cuphead also has a unique New Game Plus mode that’s worth trying to get. Score an A rating or better on each stage and you get that much closer to unlocking a hardcore black and white mode. Skilled players will definitely want to dig in and go after this mode since it matches the game’s aesthetic without compromising it. Everyone else may want to get a hang of the game first, but this mode is novel enough and a goal to strive for.Studio MDHR put together something great when the original Cuphead first released by making a tight platformer shooter with a unique sense of style. Its hardcore shooting, combined with precision controls and outstanding presentation, are still noteworthy today and will likely age well. Rookies may run into frustrations at first, but they can always take the Simple route and get the hang of everything before jumping in to deeper waters.Not only that, but the couch co-op support is spot-on as well, despite the slightly disappointing exclusion of online co-op. A second player can jump in and help out with the battle at any time. And the game is surprisingly playable in portable mode with a Joy-Con – though the Pro Controller is better because of its superior buttons.Everything about Cuphead just feels right, even all these months after its original release. As it stands right now, this game is nearly flawless in its own right, thanks to its responsive controls and signature style. That doesn’t mean it’s going to be for everyone, especially those who don’t want to or can’t get over its sometimes oppressive difficulty. But those who are determined to get through Cuphead will see that it simply spills over with joy.GameRevolution reviewed Cuphead on Nintendo Switch with a code provided by the publisher.10Share article"
Cuphead,Ozzie Mejia,Shacknews,http://www.shacknews.com/article/101526/cuphead-review-merry-melody,"New to Shacknews? Signup for a Free AccountAlready have an account? Login NowIs Cuphead as good as its animation suggests? Our review.Cuphead is a throwback in more ways than one. There's the graphic style that flashes back to the old-school cartoon shorts of the 1930s, the hand-drawn style made famous by the earliest days of Disney, Warner Bros., and MGM Studios. The classic tracking effects from vintage films and the familiar opening scratch from the monaural sound of a vinyl record.Then there's the throwback in the other way, also flashing back to the earliest days of video games, in the sense of pure unforgiving difficulty. There's no other way to say this. Cuphead is hard. It is ""throw your controller in anger"" hard. But what makes Studio MDHR's platforming boss rush game such a treat is that it modernizes the formula just enough to make it worth trying again endlessly.It's almost impossible not to marvel at what Studio MDHR has been able to pull off with Cuphead from a presentation standpoint. The opening of this review touched upon it briefly, but there's such a strong devotion to the 1930s theme that permeates throughout the entire game. The grainy vintage film effect starts from the opening credits and never goes away for anything. The loading screen is a grainy black screen with an old hourglass that flips around. Even the main menu keeps the grainy effect over the player's profile picture.It extends through the game, with a hand-drawn overworld, enemies that are capably hand-drawn to look like something out of an old Merrie Melodies short. Bosses aren't ""killed"" but rather get knocked out and left seeing stars, with old-school ""dizzy"" lines. On top of that, every level is preceded with an old-timey title card, as if it's setting up a cartoon short. It's thematically brilliant and both the art and audio teams should be commended for Cuphead's presentation.The story fits in with that old aesthetic, as well. Cuphead and Mugman sneak into the Devil's casino and get a little too cocky and wind up losing their souls in a game of craps. To appease the lord of darkness and his blockheaded lackey, King Dice, Cuphead and Mugman must battle bosses across the land, all of whom are delinquent in their debts to the Devil. The cutscenes in-between worlds are delightful and the only complaint here is that they're all-too-brief. Scenes with the Devil and King Dice are a delight and it would have been nice to see more of them.Did I mention that Cuphead is hard? Because Cuphead is hard. Cuphead is really hard!Bosses are spread out across the overworld, each of whom have their own distinct attack patterns and multiple phases. The idea is to defeat them all, though Cuphead only gets three hits. Trying to beat a boss in three hits sounds easy, but none of these boss fights have checkpoints. Dying means having to start the whole thing from scratch. Add in the fact that many of the boss attacks are inspired by bullet hell elements and Cuphead becomes a masochistic endeavor.Run-and-gun stages are similarly difficult, thanks to precision platforming and distinct gimmicks that span each stage. These platforming stages are a must for reasons I'll touch on shortly. They're skippable, but it's not recommended. These stages have their own sources of aggravation, whether it's tough-to-avoid enemy patterns or a surprise enemy that pops in out of nowhere. There's no way to recover health, either, so once Cuphead gets hit, it's one strike. Three strikes and he's out!After a few dozen bouts of throwing my controller at the wall, Cuphead's best element started to become clear. Cuphead is brutally challenging, but none of that challenge is unfair. Bosses and run-and-gun stages are entirely doable and within the realm of Cuphaed's mechanics. The game doesn't ask for complicated button inputs or special items. It's a matter of reflexes and using those natural reflexes to complete a level is genuinely satisfying. It's also helpful (though sometimes exacerbating) that whenever Cuphead dies, the Game Over screen will indicate just how close the end of the level was. That's an understated mechanic and one that offers motivation to keep trying.Friends can also play co-op and it feels like an absolute must. Co-op players have the ability to resurrect one another by using the game's parry system. Parrying on a fallen partner's floating spirit before it leaves the screen will bring them back for one more hit. This is an essential mechanic, because teamwork can carry players a lot farther. For solo players, dead is dead and there's no hope of any kind of second chance. Granted, the resurrection mechanic is hard to pull off, especially if the screen is covered in hazards, but at least the idea is there.Cuphead does have a difficulty setting and it has a more practical use than simply turning down the pain. Advancing in the world is an essential aspect of the game, mainly because of the coins that Cuphead collects in the run-and-gun levels. Upgrading Cuphead's inventory with purchases from Porkrind's Emporium is the best way to even the odds against the bosses and the best way to access the later levels is to face those bosses on the ""Simple"" difficulty.Simple difficulty boss fights make Cuphead feel much more accessible for the casual player, while also acting as vital practice sessions. They give players a sense of what to expect when taking on the ""real"" battles and they offer a sufficient challenge in themselves. ""Simple"" boss fights are not easy by any means, despite the fact that the bosses do hold back. Entire phases are skipped in Simple mode, with the boss offering those nasty surprises up for anyone that dares to tackle them on Regular difficulty.What's unfortunate about the Simple difficulty is that there's no real sense of finality for those users that want to just stop there. Attempting to access the final part of the game will simply trigger a short cutscene and turn the player back. Those hoping for, at the very least, a simplified final boss fight that offers a taste of what the true final bosses have to offer will be left wanting.Cuphead is a joyful flashback to a bygone era, both in terms of animation and in terms of crushing video game difficulty. It's easy to get lost in this gorgeous cartoon world and get overtaken by the sheer beauty and whimsy of the game's characters. Then the intensity picks up and it becomes one of the most challenging video game experiences of the year.But the best part about Cuphead is that the challenge feels attainable. It's the right kind of frustration, the kind that makes a person feel like they can prevail if they just try one more time. It's easy for this type of game to feel cheap, but it never feels impossible. It's a gorgeous piece of work and a cup that feels better on repeated sips.This review is based on an Xbox One download code provided by the publisher. Cuphead is available on Xbox One and PC on Friday, September 29 for $19.99. The game is rated E.Ozzie has been playing video games since picking up his first NES controller at age 5. He has been into games ever since, only briefly stepping away during his college years. But he was pulled back in after spending years in QA circles for both THQ and Activision, mostly spending time helping to push forward the Guitar Hero series at its peak. Ozzie has become a big fan of platformers, puzzle games, shooters, and RPGs, just to name a few genres, but he’s also a huge sucker for anything with a good, compelling narrative behind it.

					Ozzie Mejia posted a new article, Cuphead Review: Merry Melody 
					Finally, video game graphics have reached the fidelity of 85 year old cartoons!				
					Better than that: 85-year-old cartoons on scratchy old film transferred to VHS back in the 80’s. 				
					Does it 0wn?				
					I did a double take cause I thought I posted that query at first. 				
					Good review. I want to get it but i also don't want to torture myself.				
					[deleted]				
					From what I saw in the previews, yes. At least ""easier""				
					I saw on the GB quicklook, that most of the levels had a ""Simple"" or ""Regular"" option. Not sure how dialed back simple is, and would love to get some feedback on that. 
					Read the article!				
					So the article mentions multiple times about how hard the game is,but in the Pros/Cons section,it says it's challenging,but not unfair. How do those two things coincide? If a game is so hard that I want to throw and break my controller,I would say that it could qualify as unfair. If anyone has played games like VVVVVV or Risk Of Rain,you'll know where the line is between challenging and unfair.				
					uhhh, difficulty and fairness, while related, are different concepts, and being extremely diffucult yet still fair shouldn't be difficult to understand.				
					fair enough.				
					Challenging but fair means games like Super Meat Boy, Dark Souls, Contra, etc. Where the game is difficult, there may be a steep learning curve, but it isn't difficult due to cheap tricks.  The game's rules are consistent, the game rewards effort and creativity, the penalties are fair and in line with your mistakes. A tough but fair game means when you die or lose, you feel like it was because of something you did (or didn't do), not something the game did to you. Old bullet hell shmups were a mix, some were super unfair and cheap, others were very fair.				
					SUPER MEAT BOY sucked arse, though. 				
					now why you gotta ruin that sweet moneymaker of yours by saying dumb things like that, baby				
					You are fucking dead to me				
					FEEK THAT GAME				
					Honest question: what are game titles that are difficult due to cheap tricks? Like Turok with its jumping puzzles?				
					By your comparison, I would put his assessment at that point just before you feel compelled to throw your controller across the room				
					[deleted]				
					[deleted]				
					Yeah, I bought it just to support the art style but I almost don't even want to play it.				
					You're like the kid that buys that really awesome toy but never takes it out of the package! 				
					I'm really bad at games like this. My fragile ego can't take the shame :(				
					I'm curious how I'll do.  I haven't played a bullet hell game like this in I don't know how long.				
					I played undertale and hated it so I’m pretty sure this won’t be a good time. Hopefully they can add an ez mode. 				
					No kid does that; only grown-ups				
					I was that kid   not really 
					Which is unfortunate, because this is the ultimate ""git gud"" game.				
					[deleted]				
					Can't wait to buy this for $5 on Steam sale.				
					I don't know if I'll be able to go that long, but I am in no rush to play it this sort of game with all the other stuff out there right now. It does look incredible, but it can wait. 				
					That too. I am already playing Ruiner, which was an impulse purchase. It is also quite fucking hard, so I only need 1 hard game at a time.				
					[deleted]				
					Good question!  I hope it can be beaten in a single session. These kinds of arcade shooters are taxing, and if they drag on too long I lose interest. I know some folks be dumb these days and demand longer and longer games for their money no matter what's best for the experience, but I'd see this one being shorter and replayable for better score, or just mastery, as a huge benefit.   
					From the little I saw in the GB quicklook, Ben said he had played a couple hours and was 44% through. At the level select, it looked like he was a good way into World 2 with World 3 and the Finale yet to be unlocked.I'd guess about 5 hours depending on easily you work through the levels. 				
					Oh, dang. I was hoping more like 2-3 hours in total, haha.  I suppose I really just wanted to play their original version, when it was simply a boss rush game. That would have probably been about 30m - 2h depending on the length and amount of them. But I realize most people would not have been into that for the $20 or even $15 price tag, they had to build it out and make it more of a traditional run and gun platformer. 				
					It is short. I ran through it in a few days, maybe about 10-20 hours. Perfectly fine for a $20 game.				
					[deleted]				
					Over 10 hours? That's really long for a Contra/Gunstar Heroes-style game.				
					Yeah, that sounds insane				
					That’s not short! WTF people?!				
					Wow! I was expecting 5-10hrs.				
					So in that header image, did you just catch Mugman sipping on his own brains? I DRINK IT UP!				
					Like all good things, inspired by The Simpsons. https://youtu.be/x_OjqAG3VRg?t=28s 
					I'm so sad this isn't coming to PS4. It looks right up my alley.Oh well. 				
					Been playing on PC.  I've played a lot of platformers and my feeling on this one are a bit mixed.  If you strip away the beautiful graphics is this just a fairly mediocre Mega Man?  It's been a tough feeling for me to shake through the first world.  It's also a huge cop out to make the story segments be a series of stills instead of animated movies, considering the whole style of the game is aping animated movies.   The graphics are really great, of course.  I understand there isn't usually a huge budget for 2D platformers, but it makes this game in particular feel incomplete.  The difficulty is fine.  				"

Let's start with the look, which is the first thing that will attract anyone's potential interest in Cuphead. An in-game conceit puts a ""1930"" (sorry, ""MCMXXX"") trademark on the entire production, and the animation is an almost perfect throwback to that era's style of ultra-expressive, bouncy animated shorts. Characters, objects, and even pieces of background scenery wind up, squash, stretch, slide, and bounce with infectious energy.Cuphead's cast is almost as ridiculous as it is diverse. Monstrous flowers, spear-wielding seeds, oversized bouncing candies, somersaulting frogs, and a woman who transforms into various Zodiac creatures are just some of the game's many wild characters. They already look detailed and lively in static screenshots, but that's only the beginning. Each character vibrates with a manic, animated energy driven by the game's peppy, big-band jazz soundtrack. Idle characters don't just flip through a couple of frames of placeholder animation, but, rather, they twist and coil with the hidden menace of potential energy waiting to be let out. Every screen is a riot of color and motion that I can say without hyperbole is like nothing I've ever seen in a game before.The art even gets the little details of its throwback animation homage right, from slightly bleeding colors and film grain to wavy outlines that wiggle with imperfection from frame to frame. Even the map screen uses the classic animation ""feature"" of foreground elements drawn with an entirely different palette than the more muted, painterly backgrounds.The hand-animated scenes are so compelling and full of life, in fact, that the game's few purely digital art elements stand out like sore thumbs. These usually come in the form of enemy projectiles, which are often drawn with the too-perfect vector lines and shapes more commonly seen in Flash animations. These projectiles often move in overly smooth curves or straight lines, too, making them stand out further from the more sinuous, free-form animation found in the rest of the scene.In most games, this kind of overly precise, computer-generated art and animation style would barely be noticeable, much less worth noting. In the otherwise beautiful rendering of Cuphead, though, these elements stand out just enough to detract from any scene they're in.And while the thick outlines and solid colors of Cuphead's art generally make it easy to quickly ""read"" and interpret a scene, the crowded frames sometimes get in their own way. In a few levels, foreground elements obstruct large parts of the bottoms and sides of the screen. It's a cool-looking effect that brings to mind classic multi-plane film animation, but it's not worth it when a blocked view of Cuphead or an enemy results in an untimely death.Measured in a certain way, Cuphead is pretty short. The game's 18 required boss fights and six optional ""run-and-gun"" platforming stages can all be beaten in about two or three minutes each, even if you're not trying to set a new speedrun record. But that's assuming a perfect run without any deaths. Like so many classics of the 8-bit era before it, Cuphead extends its length via a brutal difficulty that will require hundreds of cumulative deaths for all but the preternaturally gifted.It's not that the bosses are unfair exactly. On the contrary, each one seems designed in the truest 8-bit throwback style, with repetitive patterns that are relatively easy to suss out as you dodge and shoot back with rapid-fire bullets. (Side note: this game really needs an ""auto-fire"" option for players who don't want to hold down the X button for hours on end.) Each boss telegraphs most of its dashes and attacks in order to give you a chance to find safety, with just enough randomness thrown in to prevent repeated attempts from feeling utterly rote. In great news, no two bosses play out even close to the same way in terms of movements or attacks (or visual design, for that matter).But a combination of the speed, size, and sheer ferocity of the enemy and projectile movements makes each fight feel unforgiving. Even a slight mistake in positioning or an overly twitchy push of the jump button will cost you one of only three pieces of health you're given. There's no limit on lives, but there are also no checkpoints, meaning one false move in the last phase of a fight can erase the last two or three minutes of hard-fought damage.Everyone's skill level will be different, but here's how the cycle of life-and-death went for my standard Cuphead boss attempt:Cuphead does provide the option of a ""Simple"" difficulty mode, which reduces the speed and quantity of attacks from bosses and generally cuts things off before the most punishing, final phase of the ""Regular"" boss. Unfortunately, beating bosses in this mode doesn't let you proceed to the game's final battles, which somewhat limits its value for less reflex-inclined gamers.Simple mode still isn't a cakewalk, but seasoned shooter fans should be able to get through most of the Simple fights in just a handful of tries. At the very least, many more players will be able to see most of the game's content by playing through on this heavily toned-down difficulty.Overall, though, I found the parry move too hard to time and mostly not useful enough to even consider the risk of taking a hit. The only real benefit for most volleys is a mark on the game's end-of-level scoring system, which hardly seems worth the effort when mere survival is victory enough.While massive boss fights form the majority of the game, you can take on a few optional run-and-gun levels to earn coins that unlock new weaponry (like an extremely useful, short-range spread gun), new abilities (like an ""invincible"" dash out of danger), and new extra-damaging ""special attacks."" I gave up on most of these platforming levels relatively quickly, though, frustrated by the endless parade of repetitive enemies and unforgiving jumps.Aside from these levels, though, Cuphead requires you to beat every single boss in each of its three sections to move on to the next selection. This is especially frustrating when a single difficult enemy prevents you from having the option to try out many more (though simple mode ameliorates this problem a bit).As I write this on deadline, I'm currently stuck on one fight against a giant robot before I can move on to a final set of battles. I've probably put in 80 attempts at this boss and not even gotten all that close to beating his final phase of screen-filling bullets and electrified walls. I'm not sure I'll be going back to try that much more.For gamers with tough reflexes forged in games like Super Meat Boy, Trials HD, or even the Contra series (or worse), the unforgiving run-and-gun boss fights of Cuphead will be a welcome challenge, leading to lots of satisfying, fist-pumping catharsis when a long string of attempts finally leads to success. For everyone else, Cuphead's awe-inspiringly detailed animation is best enjoyed in the more limited Simple mode or via the YouTube playthroughs that will surely flood the Internet in the days to come.Verdict: Those with a high tolerance for repeating difficult 2D shooting challenges should buy it. Everyone else should try it in Simple mode or just by watching on YouTube.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

Cuphead,Mikhail Madnani,God is a Geek,https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/switch-report-review-42-cuphead-remembered-caterpillars-reigns-game-thrones/,"Today’s Switch Re:Port Review looks at three games that all were on other platforms before hitting the Switch in recent times. If you’re new to the Switch Re:Port Reviews on the Geek, I (with the help of the fine folk here) look at the Switch ports of games that have been released on other platforms. These reviews aren’t just to talk about the game but to look at how the games run and play on the Switch and how they use the Switch features. Originally released on Xbox One and PC platforms including macOS and now ported to Switch and scored 8/10 on Xbox OneCuphead is something I loved on Xbox One and the Switch announcement got me aching to experience it again. There are many games that I’d love to see ported to the Switch and while some aren’t possible thanks to technical limitations, getting others in great conversions really showcases how great the Switch can be for indies. Studio MDHR’s Cuphead debuted on Windows and Xbox One before seeing a macOS release later on. It is now on Switch and this port is everything I wanted.Cuphead on the Switch maintains everything from the original game and doesn’t tone down anything. It is still a superlative run and gun action game with brilliant boss battles that will annoy and impress the heck out of you. The aesthetic and music haven’t gotten old at all and seeing everything play out so well on the Switch even in handheld mode is a sight to behold. Cuphead on Switch gets everything right. Everything from the icon to the performance and visuals are what I wanted from a port of one of the best Xbox games this generation. The gameplay style perfectly suits the Switch’s portable nature letting you pick it up for a boss attempt or a single stage on the go. Load times are also not a problem for retrying levels.Cuphead is one of the best examples of a game that was “perfect for Switch” actually getting a port that is also perfect. I expected to see Cuphead on Switch (and even PS4) eventually but never thought I’d get such a fantastic conversion on Switch. 9/10Originally released in 2017 on PC platformsOne of the best things about the eshop is seeing older games from other platforms get in the spotlight once again. She Remembered Caterpillars is a game that was released on PC platforms years ago but I hadn’t heard of it until the Switch version released. This gorgeous puzzler gets a lot of things right and the Switch port is excellent. Colour matching puzzlers aren’t new but I always enjoy seeing how developers keep things interesting. The aesthetic here is what keeps you coming back to the puzzles that get hard very quickly. There’s also a narrative here that slowly reveals itself but this sadly feels tacked on to an otherwise excellent puzzler. One of my favourite things about this game is how things manage to remain chilled out atmosphere wise even when the puzzles are complex. The Switch version looks and runs great in both docked and handheld modes but the real star of the show is the touch support not just for menus but for actual gameplay. She Remembered Caterpillars is a great addition to the Switch’s puzzle library. The port itself is pretty great as well. I love the artstyle and having touch support for gameplay in a puzzle game is always welcome. While the levels can ramp up in difficulty pretty quickly, this is an excellent puzzle game with great art and one that is worth getting on Switch. 8.5/10Originally released on iOS, Android, and PC platforms in October 2018Mobile games get ported to the Switch very often and while some benefit from having traditional controls as an option, others feel out of place. Nerial’s Reigns games still play best on iOS and Android but the conversion to PC and eventually Switch makes sense to bring them to different audiences. Game of Thrones’ final season is on and Devolver Digital and Nerial bring Reigns: Game of Thrones that debuted last October to the Switch.Reigns: Game of Thrones is a brilliant take on Reigns. If you’ve never played the Reigns games, they are on iOS, Android, PC, and Switch. They let you rule through swiping cards to make decisions. This entry brings the Reigns gameplay to Westeros with the cast of the Game of Thrones. This is definitely the best videogame version of Game of Thrones out there.As with the earlier entry, you can play Reigns: Game of Thrones with touch or button controls. It looks and runs great for the most part in both docked and handheld modes. The one performance issue I ran into consistently was when you’re about to die or progress to a landmark, the game freezes for a second. I verified this doesn’t happen at all on my iPhone 7 (pretty old by smartphone standards now). I hope this gets addressed in a patch soon. Overall, Reigns: Game of Thrones arrives just in time for the show to return and brings another fantastic game from Nerial to the Switch. I still prefer playing the Reigns games on my iPhone but this port is very good. 8.5/10 Your home for all your videogame needs.

Cuphead,Adam Cook,God is a Geek,http://www.godisageek.com/reviews/cuphead-review/,"September 29, 2017You want me to tell you it’s magnificent. I know you do. You’re sat there, praying for it to be a game that lives up to the hype. But what game could? Cuphead isn’t bad by any stretch of the imagination, but I think it’s vital that right away you understand what kind of game this really is.It’s not a platformer. Not really. There are some run and gun levels that involving platforming, and some levels require you to bounce around the single screen boss encounter, so I guess it’s a platformer of sorts. But despite the incredible visual and audio design, the colourful aesthetic that tricks you into thinking it’s a Super Mario-inspired fun-for-all-the-family romp set in the 30s, it’s just not. This is a shoot-em-up, and an old fashioned, hard as nails one at that. It’s not quite a Cave-esque bullet-hell joint, but it’s bloody hard all the same.Most of the time, the levels are single screen boss battles that are as deadly as they are brightly coloured. The first battle sees you face off against three vegetables, after that there’s a flower, some sweets, a sunflower, a bee, ghosts… you get the idea. The terrible gnawing teeth suddenly spring from a smile that’s a lie, and it’s on. Like most in the boss rush genre, it doesn’t mess around. There are multiple phases (some more subtle than others) and you have a limited pool of hit points to stay alive. You don’t get more health mid-battle, it’s not that kind of game.The battles are tense, controller smashing affairs. Every time you try, you’ll get nearer and nearer to success, and you know this because after you die (and you’ll die a lot, I had 123 deaths after finishing the first world alone) you see a little line that shows how far into the battle you got – how many phases you passed. How close you got before failing. Switching to “Simple” mode reduces a phase from the boss, and generally makes it easier, but you won’t be able to see every fight, nor “properly” complete the bosses. In honesty, Simple Mode is a bit too easy. Not so much so that a child could thrash the game, but going from Regular to Simple is almost two different games in how much the difficulty changes. It’s worth noting that you can’t “finish” the game in Simple Mode, either. If you want to do that, you’ll have to beat all bosses on the regular difficulty – and given how tough some of them are, that’s going to annoy a few people.So far, so good, right? Well, sort of. The trouble with Cuphead’s fights are that they really, seriously go to town on you. Take a game like Bloodborne, for example. The difficulty is high, but it’s mostly a case of memorising patterns, understanding the fight, and spotting the tells. The phases will have a set number of attacks from the boss, and you can tell them by their wind-up. From there, a pattern emerges: attack A is followed by B, then A, oh, now a C, then back to the start. Cuphead ignores this style, and appears to have no rhyme nor reason to the attack patterns. You might get three of one, then two different ones, then whatever, really. This means that you are never bored, but it also makes beating some bosses a real pain. It also makes me wonder how the speed-running community will take to it, and given the fact you are graded on things like parrys (you can hit jump to parry pink objects) and time, it’s definitely geared towards that genre.To mix things up, and I think to allow you to ease the strain a little, you can spend coins found in levels to buy different weapons, specials, and charms. Each shot-type (weapons really, but they all come from your finger, so they’re shots, I suppose) has a good and bad side to it. The Lobber is medium range but has good damage and a slow fire rate, but it’s the weapon that got me through that damn sunflower fight, that’s for sure. The “spread” shot fires a three-way attack, but it’s short-range with great damage. Each weapon type has an EX-version, which is usually a bigger, or stronger attack, and uses up your EX-meter (of sorts) which is shown by cards, which slowly fill up as you do damage. Super Arts do exactly what you’d imagine, and are executed when you have a full five-cards in your EX-meter. Charms affect other elements, like “Smoke Bomb”, which makes you invincible while dashing, or P. Sugar, which makes your parry automatic the first time.Mixed in with everything else is an offline, drop-in/drop-out co-op. You’d think having two Cupheads (the second player is Mugman, which is a brilliant name) on screen would make the battles easier, but instead, it makes concentrating even harder. It also appears to slightly scale up the difficulty, because after failing around fifteen times on a boss, I went back to solo and it was a breeze. That said, you can revive a killed buddy with a parry as their ghost floats away, so there’s some potential for crazy co-op runs here, probably. The “run and gun” levels are the closest to pure platforming levels, but they’re also the least fun ones.Inkwell Isle is a gorgeous place. The details are mesmerising, even down to the fact that for every way of dying, there’s a little jokey one-liner. The fights are incredibly designed, with bosses that morph and contort in demonic versions of themselves, each phase offering a new visual feast for the eyes that you must master. There are endearing characters everywhere, and though the story is simple, it’s fun and has some nice scenes to move things along. While it looks like an old Disney movie, it also has a soundtrack to match it. The songs are similar to the Randy Newman Disney compositions, explaining things as you go, giving locomotion to the story. There’s no doubt about it: Cuphead’s style makes it one of the best looking game of the year, and one of the best sounding, too.There’s depth and challenge here, but it’s going to be too much for a whole lot of people, because while it nails the elation of besting a difficult battle, sometimes the view isn’t enough of a reward for the climb. It’s not what you’d call unfair and it’s entirely surmountable, but it’s the kind of difficulty few people will be used to in today’s market. It takes no prisoners, makes no apologies, but it also respects you in a strange way that, in all honesty, the retro games it harks back to never did. I like Cuphead a lot, but I am the target market for the game. If you like very challenging games that require dedication and high concentration, then knock yourself out. It’s not quite Super Meat Boy amazing, but it is, at least, still a very good game that requires you to understand its intricacies and perfect it despite some random elements. Thank God people are still making this kind of game.Stunning visuals
Amazing soundtrack
Tight, rewarding gameplayProbably too hard for most
Gatekeeping ""completion"" behind difficultyA stunning visual feast that belies an intense level of difficulty. Cuphead won't be for everyone, but it's still a  very good game.

Please try again All of the characters and effects have been lovingly hand-drawn in a style reminiscent of Disney’s classic 1930s-era shorts, animated at a full 24-frames per second to give them the same cinematic fluidity that wowed audiences nearly a century ago. The action takes place on gorgeous watercolour paintings and benefits from a lush and original big band score – including vocals in some scenes – that sounds as though it was plucked from someone’s vintage 78 collection. Authentic film grain and an occasional bit of projector blurring serve to enhance the sense that we’re playing a game that was somehow animated 85 years ago.When it was first shown onstage at Microsoft’s E3 presser, my initial thought was that this was the game Warren Spector’s Epic Mickey ought to have been. It captures its intended era almost perfectly, playing to the advantages of a 2D medium by limiting all of the action to a side-scrolling milieu. It feels a gorgeous old cartoon teeming with personality that we, the players, just happen to have control over.But there was never really any question about whether or not it was going to be a joy at which to gaze or a pleasure to which to listen. What’s been a little iffier is whether it would be any fun to play.Early in its life Cuphead was set to be little more than a series of Contra/Mega Man-style boss battles, which may have been fun but likely would have proven unsatisfying to players looking for something with a little more meat around the bone.Apparently StudioMDHR agreed, because it took the extra time necessary – nearly four years in total – to create a full-fledged run ‘n’ gun platformer. And while the result may not be to all gamers’ tastes, I think it successfully achieves what the developers set out to do.The overarching story sees Cuphead – and his brother Mugman, if you play cooperatively with a friend (it’s fun, but doesn’t make things any easier) – trying to save their souls from the Devil by acting as his debt collectors. They need to find and beat in battle a series of wildly imaginative bosses ranging from a dancing daisy to a pair of blustery toads.These battles were always going to be part of the game. What was added during production is an overworld set on a chain of gorgeous islands as well as a series of run-to-the-right levels filled with minions and platforming challenges that provide additional context for and an essential sense of scope to the duo’s journey.Nothing of what we’re given in either the boss battles or the run ‘n’ gun levels might be considered easy, even to experienced players. Like all great action platformers dating back decades, Cuphead‘s enemies – be they boss or toady – follow specific patterns that players need to parse in order to achieve success. Figuring out how to deal with one baddy isn’t so hard, but working out how to defeat multiple enemies attacking you at the same time – or, in the case of bosses, single enemies with a range of quickly evolving attacks – is where both the pain and pleasure of the experience lies.At your disposal are a range of gradually unlocked weapons (if they can be called that, given they’re actually potions that change the sort of projectile that comes out of Cuphead’s white-gloved hand when he playfully shapes it into a pistol), special abilities, and charms – such as an extra hit point that also decreases the amount of damage you do – that must be strategically selected prior to battle in order to do maximum damage to your enemies. A boss that demands you to do a lot of aerial dodging might call for homing ammunition, which deals less damage but always hits its mark, while levels that let you get up close and personal with enemies are better suited to short range but more powerful attacks. You can choose a couple of weapons to take into every fight, so there’s room for experimentation.All of this would be for naught, though, if the controls weren’t as tight as they are. I felt like I had complete control over Cuphead’s movement right from the start. He did what I wanted him to do without exception. My failures never felt due to the game, but instead my own mistakes and lack of skill, which is exactly how it should be.Though that isn’t to say I wouldn’t have made some changes to the interface. There are parts of the game that feel in dire need of a double jump (Cuphead and Mugman can dash mid-jump, but it doesn’t give them any extra height). And one of the primary mechanics – the ability to slap pink projectiles with an open hand to avoid getting hit and to power up your special attacks – would have been more appealing had it been assigned a button other than the one we use to jump, which for some reason I still find a bit discombobulating even several hours in.These quirks aside, I always felt empowered to do what I needed to do. Success never seemed out of reach or a matter of chance, it just required practice and patience.Along the way, I died. A lot. And each time I was sent back to the start of the level or boss fight. There’s actually a spot in the overworld where you can go to check just how many times you’ve died to date – a number in which I strangely felt both pride and shame in equal amounts. But all your deaths serve a purpose: They make success, when it eventually comes, feel all the sweeter.And that sense of satisfaction isn’t our only reward. Defeating enemies unlocks new areas to explore and new levels to conquer, which means we’re treated to more of this game’s extraordinary animation and music. And, when all is said and done, these are the things for which Cuphead will rightfully be remembered.

Cuphead,Matt Cox,"Rock, Paper, Shotgun",https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/10/02/cuphead-review/,"What's cup, doc?Cuphead[official site] first appeared way back at E3 2014, where it wowed everyone with its gorgeous 1930s style cartoon aesthetic and promise of tough as nails platforming action. It finally came out last Friday and boy, does it deliver on that promise.Cuphead [official site] is like a bullet hell shooter where the bullets are more likely to be sentient balloon animals. The story is slight but delightful: after gambling away their souls, Cuphead (and Mugman, if you’re playing coop) take on the devil’s dirty work and set about collecting soul contracts across Inkwell Isle. Boss battles form the bulk of the game, with some occasional side scrolling platforming thrown in for variety. Those bosses are the star of the show however, beautifully brought to life by the unique hand-animated art style. I’ve faced a telekinetic carrot, a pair of boxing frogs that eat other to turn into a slot machine, and a unicycling plane lady who can transform into a bull shaped cloud, two dancing cloud women and the moon. I’ll avoid spoiling any more bosses, because discovering each one (and the different stages of each fight) is the main joy of Cuphead. Gaining mastery over the challenge is satisfying, sure, but that’s nothing new - you can get that from your Super Meat Boys and your N Plus Plusses. Each of Cuphead’s bosses has more personality than can be found in the entirety of those games though. It sounds great too, with an original jazz score that perfectly accompanies the old timey visuals.   It never runs out of ways to surprise, with the bosses getting even more inventive as the game goes on. It’s also made me chuckle out loud a few times, such as when I landed the final blow on a boss and the two birds that were carrying him on a stretcher swapped out their medicine pills for salt and pepper shakers. Every animation oozes charm, from the dancing hourglass that appears on loading screens to the way Cuphead pulls up his trousers at the start of each fight.  
 
If you want to actually see those bosses though, you’re going to have to Git Gud. Each level can be played on ‘simple’ or ‘regular’ difficulty, but you only get to fight the last bosses once you’ve beaten the rest on regular. Simple mode slashes the bosses health pools and takes away entire stages from the fight, which it would be a shame to miss out on. It’s still a great inclusion as a sort of ‘tourist’ mode, however, and will allow a lot of people to appreciate a game they otherwise wouldn’t, while still rewarding those who persevere on regular difficulty.In both modes, you can only take three hits before having to start over. That can be changed by placing a certain item in your charm slot, which can be bought using coins that you earn from the side-scrolling “run ‘n gun” levels I mentioned earlier. However, that charm also reduces the damage you do - and more importantly it would mean you couldn’t take a different charm that makes you invincible whenever you do the dash move. That one allows you to zip right through enemies, and I couldn’t imagine playing the game without it.You can also perform parry slaps by pressing A just before you collide with a red object or red enemy. It’s a neat risk/reward mechanic, with a successful slap earning you a card towards the super meter. That super meter also fills up by just dealing damage, and can be partially drained to use an enhanced version of a normal attack, or by saving up all of it for a more devastating super move.  
 
While you start with just the one gun, more can be bought, and it can be fun to experiment with their different normal and enhanced attacks. You can take two into each level: sometimes I managed to defeat a boss by picking a smart combination of weapons rather than relying purely on twitch skill. There’s a gun that auto-aims but does less damage, which I initially thought would only be a good option for when a certain stage needs you to focus on dodging. I’d forgotten to take into account that doing slightly less damage per hit doesn’t matter when there’s no need to ever stop firing. Pairing that up with the charge-up gun that doesn’t have an autofire and calls for precision shots meant I could do as much damage as possible in every situation.Cuphead isn't just about reaction times and pattern-learning. I learned to sit back and rethink my approach to a level on occasion. Is that part of the screen as dangerous as I thought it was? Are those pink jelly beans easier for me to farm super meter cards from than I first thought? What if I try saving my super for that stage, or use enhanced attacks to get through that tricky section faster? It rarely feels unfair, although it sometimes took me dozens of attempts to work out how to beat the latter stages of a fight. You don’t get another chance to figure out how to beat those stages until you’ve gotten through the earlier ones again, which can be grueling when you know you’re only going to fail once more. The final bosses are particularly cruel in that regard, although I guess that’s to be expected in a game that places such a large emphasis on difficulty. 
 
I ran into that old thing where failing multiple times at a level can make you frustrated and cause you to mess up earlier sections that you thought you'd already mastered, which leads to more frustration and more mistakes and ARRRGH. At several points I slammed my controller down and walked out of my room, only to slink back in again after a minute or two. “This time I’ll do it,” I’d say to myself, “this time will be the one.” It rarely was.As frustrating as that can be, it was why I found myself punching the air in jubilation after difficult bosses. And they're all bloody difficult - but I wouldn’t have it any other way. If that sounds enticing rather than off-putting to you, then I can unreservedly recommend Cuphead. If not, then simple mode might still make the game worth visiting for those who just want to enjoy the delightful aesthetic, though it’s far from the full experience. Cuphead is available now for Windows, and is available via the Windows 10 Store, GOG and Steam for £14.99.You're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!

Cuphead,Mike Dunn,GamingTrend,http://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/once-more-unto-the-drink-cuphead-review/,"It’s somewhat amazing that a quirky indie game that is basically a mash-up tribute to prohibition era cartoons and 80s style run-and-gun shooters captured the attention of gamers as intensely as it did when it was announced a few years ago, bringing with it a level of hype usually reserved for much larger titles. Thanks to MHDR’s uncompromising vision, Cuphead lives up to that hype and more, bringing us what will likely be considered a classic for years to come.After losing their souls in a dice roll, dishy brothers Cuphead and Mugman are tasked with balancing the Devil’s books by collecting soul contracts from the other denizens of Inkwell Isle. Apparently the whole island loves to gamble in the Devil’s Casino, and none of them are willing to go down without a fight. It’s in fighting this diverse cast of surreal characters that the core of the game lies. Whether it’s a pair of boxing frogs, a crazed actress, or a candy princess, each of these bosses instantly transform from adorable to menacing in order to fight off the brothers. It’s a tried and true conceit that sets up the boss battle gameplay wonderfully, and hearkens back to the plots of the 1930s cartoons that Cuphead draws inspiration from.Playing dice with the Devil in the pale moon lightThe visual design and animation of Cuphead is utterly stunning, a love letter to the art of hand-drawn 2D animation. Every aspect of the production adheres to the aesthetic originated in the pre-war classic cartoons of the golden age, from the looping cycles and constant movement of the characters to the color pallette and grainy “film quality” on the screen. If there is one thing that makes the brutal difficulty worth dealing with, it is the utter delight of watching this game in motion.Of course the animation wouldn’t feel nearly as authentic without a soundtrack to match the era the game recalls, with nearly three hours of original jazz, big band, and ragtime music providing the bouncing rhythm for each boss battle. Mind you, being greeted by a barbershop quartet every time you start up the game can get a little old, but the utter charm of it all is just so overwhelming, it’s hard to get too annoyed. Likewise, hearing the handful of announcement voiceovers at the beginning of each battle walks a fine line, though I did find myself occasionally spontaneously proclaiming “A brawl is surely brewing!” even when I wasn’t actually playing the game.Suddenly I want to watch Clash of the TitansNo bones about it- this game is challenging and requires a level of commitment from the player rarely found in games today. Be prepared to fail often, but be open to learn from those failures. The majority of the game is borne out over several boss battles- intense multi-phased skirmishes that often seem impossible on the first few tries. No two boss battles are alike, and each phase of each battle requires a different strategy, largely relying on constant shooting and building up your EX meter, enabling a limited but more powerful attack based on your current weapon. A successful battle generally only lasts about three or four minutes, but it may take you considerably longer to reach that point. While the enemies don’t have health bars during battle (you have to rely on discerning their patterns to figure out how far along you are in the moment), each loss is rewarded with a progress bar with hash marks for each phase and a marker for how close you may have been to completing the level. Nothing quite beats the high of overcoming a boss battle after considerable effort, when a win is earned through the persistence of picking yourself up and trying again, learning from each failure along the way.Now, you may be tempted to select the ‘Simple’ setting after a few beatdowns, which is the easier of the two difficulty levels initially available. While this is a good way to open up more of the Inkwell Isle map, you won’t be able to complete the game this way. The only way to face off against the Devil at the end of the game is to collect all of the contracts from all of the bosses you’ve fought, and the only way to do that is to defeat them on ‘Regular’ mode. That said, there is some merit to the strategy of opening up the map and coming back to pick trickier bosses off later, especially in the early part of the game before you’ve acquired additional weapon types and power-ups. You see, it takes coins to get those new abilities, and with the exception of a handful that can be found on the world map, the only place to get those coins is in the five ‘run-and-gun’ levels.Woody has gotten aggressive in recent yearsThese levels significantly diverge from the gameplay found in the boss levels. They are basically side-scrolling platforming stages, in some ways more difficult than the bosses due to having to actually progress through extensive terrain and waves of enemies. Pattern recognition is just as key here, but there is an additional layer of randomness that sometimes can get infuriating. Mind you, these levels are technically optional- you do not need to defeat them to battle the Devil at the end of the game. However, you do need coins to get the power-ups and weapon types that will give you more flexibility in how you tackle the boss levels. I found that playing these levels enabled me to get better at the parrying mechanic- hitting jump as you come into contact with just about anything pink- a crucial move when trying to build up your EX ability meter.Another way to combat difficulty is to find an equally masochistic friend to play as Mugman with you. Once both players get accustomed to the added visual noise on the screen that a second player brings into the mix, taking down bosses does get a little quicker and easier (even though they do appear to get a health bump to compensate), but it takes a little time to get into sync and not confuse your partner’s character for your own. Ultimately, I played through most of the game solo, but there were times I wish I had an equally skilled player sitting next to me.“To me, my X-Men!”As I progressed through the game and collected more and more abilities and weapons, I was struck at how useful each of them ended up being as I changed up strategies with each battle. In fact, the overall design of the game is just so consistent and deliberate that things that I initially thought were potential flaws or bad balance decisions ended up being more about how my approach to that part of the game was flawed, and questioning and changing that approach invariably led me to discover more brilliance in the level design as a result. Cuphead is so consistent with the rules it sets out that I found it hard to fault anything that fell within those rules.In fact, the only real gripe that I have with the game is that I found the default controller settings to be problematic, and after a few quick tweaks, taking advantage of triggers and moving the EX fire action to a button less accidentally hit, my game improved significantly.Every once in awhile a game comes along that inevitably inspires a new generation of gamers, artists, and designers, an inflection point that imprints itself on the genetics of the medium and held up as a gold standard for years to come. Cuphead is one such game, a quirky assemblage of novelties that comes together in a breathtaking fashion, with a charming exterior that belies one of the most challenging games of this generation.—Mike DunnSee below for our list of partners and affiliates:One of the longest running independent gaming news, reviews and culture sites on the web.The thing that is magical about the Wizarding World isn’t the magic – it’s...by Ron BurkeThe world is going to end.

Here’s how it works.Cuphead is now available, and after several years in development since the game's announcement, you have to wonder if it's worth all of the hype – well, it is.Cuphead is a true work of art. Hand-painted backdrops, frame-by-frame hand-drawn sprites, with some of the most imaginative, whimsical, and wacky boss battles ever seen in gaming.Cuphead is a side-scrolling shooter which pays homage to several classic design principles, across both art and gaming. Contra-style directional shooting, schmup bullet-hell levels, and vaudevillian art coalesces to create a game that assaults your eyes and your brain, with its sheer beauty and diabolical difficulty.As a game, Cuphead certainly won't appeal to everyone, but it's a shining beacon of creativity in its purest form that ought to be celebrated by gamers everywhere. Here's our Cuphead review.You can't write a review of this game without talking about Cuphead's artwork; it's simply breathtaking throughout.Studio MDHR hand-animated every backdrop, every sprite, and every special effect in tribute to classic cartoons of the early 1900s. The animation of that era was capricious and frankly, slightly unhinged, becoming unwittingly creepy in the process. Studio MDHR took this sentiment to another level, basing their entire visual structure on it to great effect.In Cuphead, you play as either Cuphead or Mugman (in 2-player local co-op), who have unfortunately fallen afoul of the Devil. While gambling, the pair managed to lose their souls on a bet, but the Devil offered to put them to work instead. Cuphead and Mugman effectively become debt collectors for Satan throughout the game, traveling around to face off against various deranged bosses who owe their souls to the Devil.Cuphead is comprised of three main overworlds sporting different visual themes. Without going into too much detail, the first takes place in countryside lands, with forests and farms, while the second takes place in an amusement park, with rides and other attractions.The creatures you'll encounter are vaguely thematic for each world, but the endless surrealism makes almost every aspect of the game a constant surprise. A lady zeppelin riding a flying bike, transforming into a giant bull, then into a giant moon, spraying projectiles all over the place. A princess with a severed head, riding a living birthday cake, assaulting you with an army of living jelly beans, candy corn, and cupcakes. A battle a-top a roller coaster, against a clown that can transform into a giant balloon and a carousel, who spits baseball-throwing penguins.Every single frame of Cuphead oozes ingenuity.This really is the tip of an iceberg of absurd designs that will enthrall as much as they disturb, owing to that 1920s oddness. Less odd, however, is the game's musical score, which features an incredible 56 tracks of original jazz and ragtime songs composed by Kristofer Maddigan and performed by live musicians. The authenticity elevates the experience as a whole and really typifies the attention to detail Studio MDHR have strived for when recreating the sights and sounds of the period.Every single frame of Cuphead oozes ingenuity. I've died simply because I was distracted by the stunning displays on offer. Cuphead's visuals are arresting, and they will ensnare your attention and soften the blow while you suffer through its aggressively punishing gameplay.Cuphead revives schmup and classic side-scrolling shooter sensibilities, evoking memories of Contra and Gunstar Heroes with its gunplay and phase-changing boss battles. Cuphead was originally going to be a boss rush game, but after receiving additional funding from Microsoft, the game expanded to include platforming levels and other events and features.Quite a few deaths on this zeppelin lady. #Cuphead pic.twitter.com/wYKfFR2X3H— Jez ☕ (@JezCorden) September 28, 2017Supporting 2-player local co-op, Cuphead places up to two players in an overworld, hand-painted and full of peril. As you move from one boss to the next, the game's island worlds open up to new areas, providing more activities.You can play each event on a ""simple"" mode, which removes some of the trickier mechanics, dumbing the fights down and allowing you to progress. But if you want to truly complete the game, you'll have to git gud and stick it out on regular mode – this is the only way to claim each boss's soul for your fiendish benefactor.Each boss battle comes with multiple phases that must be learned via trial and error (or… using a guide on the internet, but seriously, it'll be far more rewarding if you tough it out yourself). If you survive each phase, you'll win, receive the soul, and also be graded on your performance. There are achievements attached to the grades and even 200g for completing the game without dying. That's one achievement I'm pretty certain I won't ever get.You will die in Cuphead, a lot, complete with a Dark Souls-like ""YOU DIED"" message after each failure. There's even a fountain in the second world that will tell you exactly how many times you died. One of the bosses there single-handedly doubled my death count due to its difficulty, but it's easy to jump right back into the action – thankfully you don't have to reload each level after death.The vast majority of Cuphead deaths will be due to trial and error. Sometimes it's not clear whether something is a projectile or a safe platform, and the only way to find out is to risk a hitpoint on it. You get three hits per level, then it's game over and time to restart the mission.There's also an element of randomness in most boss battles, which serve to make repeat attempts feel fresh, but at the same time, on some of the more chaotic bosses, the RNG stars can align to place you in inescapable situations, which can be frustrating.The game gives you options to limit the impact of chance, however. There's a special store on each world that gives you access to power-ups and additional weapons. One of the weapons gives you the option of switching to a shotgun-like bullet spread, trading range for additional damage. This extra option gives you the ability to speed through certain boss phases a little faster, reducing the risk of something going horribly wrong.There are various other powerups and weapons to choose from, purchasable using coins discovered in the game's ""Run 'n Gun"" side-scrolling platformer missions, hidden throughout the level. There are also mausoleum challenges that give you access to powerful ""super"" ability, such as temporary invincibility and a large horizontal beam. The supers charge up over time, represented as playing cards in the bottom left-hand corner of the HUD. You can spend single cards on a mini-attack, or build them all up for a super, which does far more damage. Managing these abilities and powerups forms part of the game's difficulty – knowing how and when to use those abilities without getting yourself killed in the process is an important skill.You may occasionally find yourself stuck to the point where you'll go backtracking to find missing coins, to purchase weapons and items that might give you an edge in any given fight. Sometimes, even the slightest advantage can be the difference between victory and a smashed-up controller.That said, while randomness can get you killed, Cuphead never feels truly unfair. There's always something you could've done, something you could've pre-empted or prepared for to avoid losing a crucial hit point.The end of every difficult fight is such a rewarding, satisfying feeling.And even if you do end up dying 10 or 20 times on a single fight, most bosses are designed to utilize different tactics or abilities when you start over, which keeps you on your toes and eliminates the sense of grind. It shows great foresight on the part of Studio MDHR.Playing Cuphead's missions on regular difficulty requires near-constant concentration, and some will find that exhausting – I know I did. Taking breaks and coming back with a fresh mind often helped me power through the difficulty and panic of those increasingly chaotic phases. I found that even after dozens of failed attempts, I kept coming back for more because the rewarding Knockout! exclamation at the end of every difficult fight is such a gratifying, satisfying feeling – and each time you die, you get a little better. The final levels will make even the most hardened gamers rage.Loved this boss. So many mechanics to watch out for. #Cuphead pic.twitter.com/SoWjquxeU5— Jez ☕ (@JezCorden) September 29, 2017Cuphead is a tremendous achievement that will probably go down as one of this year's most beautiful and creative titles. Each level, each song, and each boss character is a meticulously crafted work of art in its own right, that you won't soon forget.The gunplay mechanics might feel a little dated, paying homage to 8-bit shooters of yesteryear, but they're well executed overall, and come with some modern flair in the form of super attacks and other powerups.The randomness on some boss fights will frustrate some, but patient, methodical gamers will relish the challenge, and enjoy the sense of accomplishment at the end of each huge battle.It's an incredible oversight that Studio MDHR and Microsoft couldn't get online co-operative play into the game ready for launch (if at all), but at least the local co-op is well thought out. Cuphead has some solid longevity across its three main worlds and dozens of levels (and more if you go for its more challenging achievements).Cuphead is an instant classic that will build a solid fanbase across Xbox One and Windows PCs, and hopefully, spawn bigger and bolder sequels in the years to come.

Cuphead,Olivia White,Telegraph,http://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/reviews/cuphead-review-cracking-good-time/,"Cuphead, StudioMDHR’s boss-brawling platform-shooter, has been a long time coming. Seven years, in fact. We all laugh about games taking ages, or being delayed, but Cuphead is an example of a game having a lengthy gestation period and coming out fantastic.You play as the titular Cuphead, and if you’re playing local co-op, player two plays his brother Mugman. The brothers cup have fallen afoul of the devil after developing an addiction to gambling. The only way to pay off their debts is to collect the souls of the inhabitants of Inkwell Island, a variety of beings that the game macabrely hints are Cuphead and Mugman’s pals.To collect these souls, the brothers basically have to shoot the hell out of everyone, kill them, collect their souls and hand them over to the devil. But of course these cheerful pieces of crockery don’t want to be in league with the devil, so they hatch a plan. That plan still involves killing everything in sight, but at least it might have a happy ending.Inkwell Isle is divided into four separate sections, and to clear each one you have to collect all the soul contracts on that island. This means fighting a series of bosses, which forms the central premise. But to do this, you’ll need upgrades; guns and charms which can be bought with coins.Collecting those coins mostly revolves around playing the game’s six Run & Gun levels. These are platforming combat challenges that see Cuphead traversing levels filled with regular enemies, traps and obstacles to collect five coins dotted throughout. The Run & Gun levels were later additions to the game, being announced part-way through development, but they are wonderfully designed. Precise controls and clear, colourful visuals make these levels a joy, and my only complaint is I’d like to see more of them since they’re so good. Levels range from treks across treetops to fighting through sinister funfairs, and showcase the wonderful art style.But it is the bosses where the game really shines, artistically and mechanically. The game utilises its 1930s cartoon style with aplomb, depicting pugilist toads, malicious genies, sexy squid girls and violent vegetables. Part of the pleasure of Cuphead is discovering what weird and wonderful individual is going to show up next. The animations are sublime and energetic, while easy to read cues mean that the style is not only gorgeous, but functionally excellent as well.Fighting these creatures is a joy. Whether you’re using the default pea shooter, the close range spread shot, or any one of the other four gun types available, fights are varied and energetic. They really possess that sense of ‘this is impossible’ followed by ‘I see how to do this’ and then ‘I’ve nailed this’.If you are struggling on a fight, mixing up your loadout - guns, as well as one of the various charms, including an invincibility dodge or an extra health point - can change the course of the bout dramatically. And when you die, a progress bar shows you how far into the fight you got, and how many phases of the boss are left. It’s a game designed around teaching you how to get better at it, with everything from the character animations to the post-death screen giving you clues on how to develop your skill.Very rarely did I feel like I was making no progress on a boss; even in sections where I was dying in the same place over and over, I could feel my skills - utilising the weapons, learning to time my parries etc - improving. For a game that’s about dying and retrying a lot, progress feels almost constant.For some of the bosses, Cuphead takes to the skies, flying a plane as he decimates his foes. These levels function as lovely classic shoot ‘em up style fights, usually throwing regular enemies at you alongside the screen-filling bosses. The shmup levels provide even further variety to the already varied boss fights, and serve as yet another love letter to the genres that inspired the game.There has been a lot of chatter about Cuphead’s difficulty, about it being hardcore, and to an extent it is a difficult game, but it’s also a very accessible one for the run and gun shooter genre. Boss fights have a Simple mode that essentially serve as training modes, letting you get used to some of the easier fight patterns before moving onto Regular. Chances are if you’re super struggling in a Regular fight, changing your loadout is what will help. The game is tough but fair, doing everything it can to help you improve.For instance, I’m not normally very good at games like this, despite loving Gunstar Heroes, Mega Man, Metal Slug and the like. And yet I was able to see Cuphead through to completion, with my save file currently sitting on 105% (there’s an Expert mode to unlock post-game, as well as a bunch of secrets to find). This is the sign of a game that respects is players, and a developer who genuinely wants you to constantly improve at the game and get to see everything. I feel like playing Cuphead has helped improve my overall skill level in the genre itself, which goes to show how good a job it does at coaching its players.From the backgrounds to the animations to the bold colours, Cuphead is  a love letter both to classic cartoons and platform-shooters, fine tuned and tweaked so it plays like a dream. It also manages to take a certain much-maligned gaming trope and turn it into something wonderful. Without spoilers, this part actually ended up being one of my favourite sections in the game. You’ll know when you get there.And you should get there. If you have any interest at all in platformers, 2D shooters or both, Cuphead is an absolute must-play. It is the pinnacle of the genre, and deserves to go down in history as an all-time classic. While I would’ve liked more Run & Gun levels, that’s due to the fact they’re so excellent, rather than the fact six isn’t enough. I hope we get to see a sequel with more of its mayhem. But if we don’t, Cuphead stands alone as one of the most satisfying, enjoyable and well-crafted video games of the year."
Cuphead,Sam White,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/09/cuphead-review-game-visuals-thrills-1930s-animation,"This meticulously crafted title is more than just an ode to the golden age of animation – it’s a punishing yet moreish game that’s not for the faint-heartedYou may have heard that this game is hard. We can report, its difficulty has not been overstated – but punishment isn’t everything it has to offer. While Cuphead is decidedly painful, committed to beating you over the head with death after death in its 1930s-style animated world, it’s also meticulously crafted. It’s rich in tone, near pitch perfect in its balancing and it’s dedicated to teaching you the best way to succeed – all while you desperately sway between bashing your head against a wall and screaming in victorious elation.Bosses are the central spectacle here – ultra-paced, wonderfully designed, concentrated encounters that punctuate its run-time – but the immediate appeal is its inimitable art style. As a homage to the early days of animated cartoons, Cuphead is about as authentic as you get. The film grain crackles and its watercolour backgrounds pop with an obsessive attention to detail that never lets up. Its characters, too, are a work of art, offering up some of the most visually distinct creatures you will see in video games. That unflinching authenticity seeps into every part of Cuphead, from its menus to its music; from its character names – shout out to Porkrind the shop keeper – to their voice work. It’s fantastic across the board.The bosses and levels are best left discovered on your own, of course, thanks to some excellent and inventive designs and unexpected transitions that surprise both visually and mechanically. Levels come in three forms – run’n’gun left-to-right platforming, bullet-hell style flight bosses and pure platforming fights. They’re some of the most distinct in recent memory. Telepathic carrot-firing vegetable creatures; frog boxers who transform into coin-shooting slot machines; or a giant bird in bizarre armour; developer Studio MDHR consistently breaks its own design moulds as it rolls out one unique boss after another, all of which offer up their own idiosyncrasies.It’s up to you to properly learn the ropes – and by God will it take some learning – in order to get through unscathed. You have no way to regain health mid-fight and just three pips of life before you die. There are no mid-level checkpoints either. This is hardcore at its hardest.The only way to really make headway is to utilise your combination of two main weapons, a super attack and a bonus power to figure out the best way to defeat a boss. You unlock new abilities fairly rapidly, allowing for further customisation and on-the-fly experimentation in the fights you’re having most trouble with. Some bosses will be better fought with short-range, high-damage attacks. In others you’ll want to keep your distance, depending on the kind of moves that particular boss is prone to doling out. As you go you’ll find the challenge increases but stays, aside from a few later-game exceptions, consistently fair.With no health bar for enemies and no sense of visual feedback, though, there’s no way to no how far you are from victory in any given fight. This seems like a misstep that serves the beautiful art style but can, at times, feel needlessly obtuse from a gameplay perspective. There were times when we would die and realise we were on the brink of winning, thanks to a post-death progression meter that shows your relative progress towards victory, only to have to retry again. But it’s these close defeats that keeps you pushing forward for a win. Always waiting for the sweet sound of “Knockout!” to signify the boss is down.In what must be some kind of internal joke, Cuphead’s bosses have two difficulty settings. The first is, almost tauntingly, called “Simple” while the other is called “Regular”. This essentially translates to “really damn hard” and “how the hell is this even harder”. On the former difficulty, you will encounter obstacles enough to halt the progress of even the most capable player – even a bouncing blue ball of a boss that simply boinks from side to side can, somehow, be challenging. On the latter, it can be phenomenally tough.Playing on simple mode will only get you so far, too – the game locks off its finale until you’ve defeated everything in the preceding three worlds in regular mode. You also don’t get to see entire portions of boss fights if you play in Simple, meaning you miss out on some of Cuphead’s incredible design elements. That aforementioned coin-spitting slot machine simply gets cut out if you fight the frog boxers in simple mode. Worse yet, you miss the ratings cards, which beg you to replay fights in quicker times, or without losing your trio of lives.Some players will likely malign this decision, criticising its developers for locking off content for the elite few capable of besting its bosses on regular mode. For us, it shows a laser focus that pushes you constantly to better your game. Cuphead is absolutely not for the faint of heart, then, but it’s certainly captivating. Come for the gorgeous bygone ragtime jazz, Porkrind’s shop and an evil carrot; stay for the thrill of defeating a boss you’ve spent hours attempting. It’s painful, but you won’t find many games with such a moreish, satisfying sting.Studio MDHR; PC/Xbox One (version tested); £18"
Cuphead,Olivia White,Telegraph,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/reviews/cuphead-review-cracking-good-time-nintendo-switch/,"In a surprising turn of events, the one-time Xbox One exclusive cartoon shooter Cuphead has come to Nintendo Switch.

Cuphead,Stephen Tailby,Push Square,http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/cuphead,"GuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpCuphead2020 8.2Game RatingUser Ratings: 39Our Review: Scroll DownStorm in a teacupVersion Reviewed: PS4 (Standard) / EuropeanThere's not much more we can really add to the conversation surrounding Cuphead. It's been out for nearly three years on other platforms, and arrives on PlayStation 4 with everyone in the know. While we'll probably just be echoing others, it would be remiss of us to not voice our thoughts, so here goes. Cuphead is gorgeous, clever, but tough as old boots.This is a 2D, run and gun action game heavily inspired by cartoons from the 1930s. It apes the rubber hose animation style (look it up) of early Fleischer and Disney, and it does so in spectacular fashion. The first thing that strikes you about this game is how it looks and sounds, and StudioMDHR has absolutely nailed the aesthetic. It feels inexplicably authentic; the hand painted backgrounds, exaggerated expressions, and nightmarish characters are all present and correct. The amazing visuals are accompanied by a fantastic jazz soundtrack to deliver the full presentational package — it's brilliant.In terms of gameplay, this is a very straightforward experience. You can run, jump, dash, and shoot — that's about it. There are some more complex wrinkles, like being able to parry pink objects, and building up a special meter by shooting enemies, but mechanically speaking, this is pretty simple stuff. Simple doesn't mean easy, though, and this game does everything it can to test you on these basic elements.The game puts most of its energy into boss battles, which are definitely the stars of the show. Like all the villains from that era of cartoons, the bosses here are big personalities, and there are some seriously creative designs. They are also extremely difficult to defeat. Each boss goes through multiple stages, ramping up the challenge as you constantly blast them with bullets. You're rarely given a moment to breathe in the few minutes it'll take to bring one of these baddies down — this is a relentlessly hard game.Sometimes it can feel unfair — and occasionally, it is — but almost every death is on you. There might be a lot happening onscreen, but attacks are clearly telegraphed and you have everything you need to survive. It all comes down to memorising attack patterns and skilfully weaving your way through an onslaught of obstacles. Upon death, you're shown how close you came to finishing a fight, and it stings when you're a hair's breadth from victory, but infinite, instantaneous restarts lead to an addictive cycle of fighting, losing, and learning. The quality in boss battles varies, but most of them are great tests of your dexterity. Practice makes perfect.While bosses are largely successful, the Run and Gun stages are less entertaining. These are more traditional platforming stages, but we found them to fall a little flat. They're quite creative in places, with some neat environments and interesting gimmicks. Hidden coins in each level can be spent on new weapon types and other perks, and these can be a huge help, so these stages are worth playing. However, they lack the impact of the bosses, and often feel like a slog to get through.Boss fights can feel the same way on occasion, but the constant shifting into new stages helps them tick along at a decent pace. Even though the various phases give you a rough idea how far through a fight you are, there's a general lack of feedback to your shots, and sometimes it feels as though you're not making a dent. It's hard to put our finger on what's missing — perhaps more sound or controller vibration would help — but your attacks feel soft. Hits are conveyed by enemies briefly flashing white, but there's no oomph. It's like firing a water pistol at a house fire. Perhaps it makes the payoff when you do conquer a boss all the sweeter.Cuphead can be played solo or with a buddy in local co-op, but this is a double-edged sword. It can be helpful to have an ally, as they can revive your ghost if you die, but the chaos onscreen makes it very hard to keep track of what's going on. Though you'll likely have an easier time alone, it's a fun alternative way to play.Cuphead might be a tough cookie, but it charms with superlative art and music. For every time you might be frustrated by a tough section, you'll be delighted by some wonderful animation or new attack. It isn't perfect; the Run and Gun levels don't live up to the bosses, and a lack of feedback can make fights feel futile. Overall, though, the game succeeds in what it sets out to do — just be prepared for a real challenge.Good 7/10Scoring PolicyReview copy provided by StudioMDHRPlease note that some external links on this page are affiliate links, which means if you click them and make a purchase we may receive a small percentage of the sale.

There's no feedback at all when I hit a boss in Dark Souls 1.Also, it's not like the game doesn't inform you. Maybe there's no ""oomph"", but enemies flash red whenever you land a succesful hit. So it's pretty clear when you're doing the right thing.Cuphead is an excellent but tricky game. Clearly the developers have poured a lot of passion into it.@Kidfried Whether it's purposeful or not, I don't much care for it It's a shame that I keep hearing about how difficult this game is, because I find that kind of gatekeeping prohibitive. I think I'd love it otherwise, but I can't spend money on something that I probably won't be able to complete (or won't enjoy doing so, at any rate).Here's hoping everybody who waited patiently for this PS4 port feels differently, and relishes the challenge! Best of luck!@Kidfried I don't even agree with it, I thought the feedback was more than enough and that coupled with distinct stages of the boss fight and the progress bar showing you exactly where you died was plenty of information.Then again I really enjoyed the run and gun stages as well with its Contra style gameplay and excellent parry mechanic mixing things up. This is easily one of the best games I've played this generation, with amazing visuals and excellent gameplay@RogerRoger I do think its difficulty is overstated, there's nothing unfair about it and everything is telegraphed. Its one of those games that if it released in the 80's or early 90's I don't think its difficulty would ever be talked aboutNever did fancy this. The old art style just doesn't do it for me.@carlos82. This game is easily a 9 to me.word up sonI really enjoyed this game when I played it on Xbox One, but the difficulty did eventually get the better of me.This game is great. It's really hard sometimes, but if you put in the time to learn how to play, and experiment with all of the different shots and abilities you can find something that works for you.Don't get me wrong, the game stays pretty hard, but I think it works in this game's favor. The difficulty keeps things at a pace where you can appreciate the game and its art.It's not everyone's cup of tea, as a lot of people don't like struggling, most if not all, but it's worth it in the end when you finally reach your goal.It's really very good, and there's a dry spell on games right now, so if you are willing to practice the skill it takes to beat this game I'd really recommend it.If you're not willing to practice, and just want to chill out after a long day of work then I don't recommend it.I'm honestly very surprised it's on PSN. I'm gonna pick it up sometime soon. It deserves support.@carlos82 I'm grateful for your reassurance, but I'm also aware that the gradual shift in gaming towards easier, more accessible difficulty levels has softened... heck, has blunted my skills. Generally speaking, I'm also somebody who just doesn't wanna get stressed or be challenged in his downtime. I get enough of that elsewhere!Should it ever be included in a PSN sale for a fiver, or if it winds up being given away free with PS Plus, then I might reconsider.@carlos82 I agree, it's not too hard. The game just isn't too long, so if you were able to finish the three-minute-levels in two or three times, you'd be done with the game in an afternoon.And it's not like the game requires you to do something impossibly fast or complex or something. Just learn what you need to do takes a few tries and a few practices. And levels are only a few minutes too, so it's not like Nioh where you have to be excellent for sometimes fifteen minutes until the next checkpoint, using the right stances, rolls and blocks at the right timing.@Quintumply That's fine, but to me it feels a bit like if I would negatively review a racing sim for having manual transmission. Sure, that's my opinion and completely true for me, but having manual transmission is a design choice that works really well for those games. Just like I think this system was implemented quite successfully in making you feel like a David fighting a Goliath every boss again.Oh hell naw...this is a top game of the gen...7 is not it.@carlos82 @constable_what I’ve always been interested in this game because of the amazing visuals, but tend not to play shooter games like this anymore. Y’all have convinced me!This and Ori are the best games to ever come out of Xbox! 7/10 is a steal, cuphead is a masterpiece ! I played it on switch and it’s worth every centEesh, this was harsher than I expected. It might be difficult compared to games these days but it’s still 100x easier than most run and gun games like Contra and Metal Slug.@Kidfried I get what you're saying. Thanks for your thoughtful comments 7/10.Ouch, the ""late port"" factor hit this game pretty hard.When I played the game when it released on PC a few years ago, I really hated the run 'n gun sections but the bosses were fun cause they didn't last forever.@Kidfried I 100% agree with what you have said, but here's the thing, a review is subjective, I happen to think on the feedback thing they are wrong as well, enemies when hit do flash red, which is a very old school thing from the likes on Contra etc. and it has that sort of mechanical vibe, although as @nessisonett said, Cuphead is not in the same difficulty leagues as a Contra and Metal Slug. I think there's some weird criticism in the review, but the ""feedback"" one was the most bizarre, sounds to me like the reviewer didn't really ""feel"" the game and were probably grasping for legitimate reasons as to why. Sometimes you just don't ""feel"" a game and it rubs you the wrong way and that's OK too.amazing game, it isnot a console seller but every one needs to try it. good to see ps fans get to play this little gem of a game.@RogerRoger
I got the platinum in Bloodborne, have completed all the From Software games multiple times and am currently hunting down my Sekiro platinum trophy, none of these games were as difficult as Cuphead in my opinion and none of them were anywhere near as frustrating.Just my 2 cents, if you find difficult games frustrating and you need to be selective about where you spend your money, I would exercise caution.I've always wanted this, but my response time isn't what it was 30 years ago in my 8 and 16-bit gaming days. I've tried going back and playing some of these old games I used to slaughter as a kid and they seem impossible now. So I'm afraid I just couldn't cut it with Cuphead.Disagree with the rating this time. The game is a masterpiece, of the most well crafted games ever, simply amazing and mind-boggling visuals! Sure it is frustrating but Dark Souls is frustrating, etc etc...it's not a negative imoFantastic game. Comfortably one of the standout games this generation imo.Yes, it's a relatively simple concept but there's also nothing else really like it. Then you have the incredible art style and excellent soundtrack to really polish it all off.The frustrating moments only make the success all the more sweet.Just out of interest how much of the game did you play @Quintumply?@Ear_wiG Once you get into the swing of things and get into a nice rhythm it becomes muscle memory. It's easily one of the most fun and satisfying platformers I've played, and of course the visual style is very unique, and had a lot of hard work, effort, and love put into it.The animations are all hand drawn for heck's sake.Had my eye on Cuphead for a while, love the animation and music. Curious to hear if it has multiple difficulty modes?@SegaBlueSky It has a ""Simple"" mode for bosses (which essentially makes those encounters shorter), and run and guns are optional (although you miss out on upgrades).The trade off is that it makes the game easier, but you miss out on some of the depth and a lot of the cool boss animation work.@SegaBlueSky Beating a boss on 'Simple' doesn't allow you to fully progress though. It'll only allow you to move onto the 2nd Isle (there are 3 in total) so you don't get to experience a lot of the later bosses, some of which are standouts.Once the game is beaten in 'Regular' difficulty, the option to go through the bosses on 'Expert' becomes available, where the game's difficulty ramps up to an even higher level!@Constable_What The visuals are truly incredible! I love the whacky style of old, hand-drawn cartoons, so when I first saw this game my jaw dropped. So glad it’s available on PlayStation now. Thanks for your comments. Might have to wait for a sale, but definitely will get this.@SegaBlueSky it has easy and normal, but if you want to get those contracts and advance you have to beat the boss battles on normal.A lot of people should’ve played it on PC (game can run on any computer) instead of waiting, and 7/10 because it’s difficult? The reviewer needs to git gud lol@roe About half way. I wanted to play much more before I put pen to paper of course but a) this game released suddenly so I wanted to get my thoughts out in a timely fashion and b) I'm pretty bad at Cuphead haha.@Akurusu It's our policy to only review PlayStation versions of games. There may be significant differences between platforms, and we're a PlayStation focused site.And to say the score is simply down to the fact it's difficult is extremely reductive. If you read my review and you don't understand how I came to award the game a 7, then that's on me, but I didn't mark it down because it's hard.I decided to punish the dev for making this an Xbox exclusive...so I waited 2 hours after releasing on PlayStation to purchase. I showed them!100% agreed, great review!Edit: and I agree on the lack of feedback when hitting bosses: it's not a dealbreaker by any means, but it's there.
And for those who mention Dark Souls, that game has HP bars for bosses, while in Cuphead you can inly see the equivalent after you've died, so there's no way to keep track of your current progress.@Constable_What @roe @AkurusuThanks for the answers folks!@Quintumply it's cool. I completely disagree with your view but I think a lot of people will have a similar thoughts to you.It's just the ones that persevere and enjoy this kind of challenge will end up loving it.@roe@Quintumply You literally marked it down for being “frustrating at times”. You just need to git gud.@SegaBlueSky Enjoy the game yo, and P.S. you’re gonna need your Sharingan for this one.I think the reviewer needs to Git Gud, I not saying this is a masterpiece but it’s definitely better than 7 maybe the minimum would be 8 and to me it’s a 9@SegaBlueSky You're welcome!Imagine using the term ""git gud"" in a serious manner.@LiamCroft people that do that unironically need to git gud lol.@QuintumplyThanks for the review, I feel your comments line up with the score pretty well and, importantly for me, your impressions align pretty well with mine on this game.I want to love it more than I do because I adore the look and sound of the game, but this is pretty much the main reason for wanting to play the game for me. Having said that, I have double dipped and bought it again so I have it on PS4 and Switch now🤔I'd buy it if it had more difficulty options. The game is very difficult to me and I'd prefer options on that.@Lovespuds Thank you for the note of caution, I appreciate it.I can't imagine giving this game less than a perfect score. Absolutely one of the best games I've ever played and flawless in so many ways.7/10? That's an awful rating. 8/10 or 9/10 seems more like it.Everyone enjoys a little challenge. But when its so frustrating that one a very small 1-2% ever pass it I say no thanks. I love the vintage cartoon art style so I will pick it up a deep sale.Adding another disagree to the score. I got it on Switch in April and I absolutely loved it. I bought it day 1 on PS4 to get the Platinum as I got every achievement on Switch but it is not the same. And of course to support this talented studio.Everything from character design to old school animation to music is perfect and a clear labor of love. The difficulty is high but never unfair, as you ""get"" that you will be retrying a lot until you beat the bosses.I would easily give it a 9, or even an 8 if you have issues with hard games. But again, the developer completely delivered on what they promised.If absolutey nothing else, everyone should experience the soundtrack of this game. Amazing. The rest of the game is awesome too, but soundtrack is the absolute stand out of it.@Jimmy_G_Buckets. Come on playa.get good.no game is too hard for me.im a veteran like david letterman.been playing video games since pac man.im the best.im not from the west.but from the east .the bally of the beast.word up son@NikCanPlay. One of the best games ever to me.and one beautiful game.wow.word up son@sketchturner i agree with you a 9 or 10 is spot on.cuphead is a classic word up sonI don't like it.Its hard, but not rewarding. Not my cup(head) of tea.@LiamCroft Seeing all these people spouting ""git gud"" and ""I'm the best"" almost made me double check that I hadn't entered a 2nd grade classroom 🤦🏼‍♂️@clvr. Because im the best.and thats what i am dog.aint no game to hard for me dog .so what you saying.word up son@AFCC i agree with you this game is a masterpiece.word up son@thiz i agree a 10 is cuphead or a 9 but this game is a masterpiece.the visuals fantastic.word up sonThis is why you have WeMod on PC and Game Wizard Save Editor on PS4 😉@RogerRogerI recommend you to try the game at a friend 's house or something. I was hesitant at first since I thought the difficulty was cheap or tacked on and it took a friend bringing his Switch copy and a discount to sell me.And so glad I did. One of my favorite games this gen, I clocked in 50 hours in the Switch copy and now I am replaying it on PS4. For me the learning curve is perfectly judged.@clvr Cool down, @playstation1995 is just having fun, and at no one's expense. You're the one calling someone a toddler. :')@Kidfried. Hahaha thanks for the reply.word up son@playstation1995 word@AlexSora89 exactly. I don’t understand how that’s not obvious to some people.I really want this game, but i am afraid of the difficulty. Just because I'm not the best at videogames doesn't mean i shouldnt be able to enjoy them, and i always play on easiest modes. I have so many unfinished games. It sucks for players like me who enjoy games stories or aesthetics but can never see the whole game due to difficulty. Not sure if i should buy this game. I love the style, but i dont like wasting my money on something i will never see. I cant just get good. I do my best and it's just not good enough.@QuintumplyI wish you'd actually beaten this game before you wrote this review so that it could have been more detailed — a desire to release something in a timely manner should not be considered more important than ensuring said something is the best version of itself that it can be.@Ultimategamer132 In an ideal world, we'd have had a review copy well in advance, and I could've played it all the way through before writing, but here we are. @Quintumply Does Push Square set strict deadlines?I feel like you guys should've either just waited to review the game properly or had someone review it that had already played through on another platform.Just my 2p.A demo of this would be great - I love the aesthetics, but fear for its difficultyHow has this come to PlayStation??? Didn't the makers once say it will never come out on PlayStation once?!?! Shame they said that because that is the reason I won't buy it even tho it looks good. Oh well.@Arnna It's not like ""our"" side - the Nintendo one (""side"" is figurative, natch9 - is completely exempt from the ""sour grapes"" treatment, either.@Carl-G You should know the saying, never says never. That was a different time, different era, different moment. Remember when Sega said they will never make a Sonic game for a Nintendo system? Many gens later and Sonic games are on Nintendo GameCube and GBA. Remember when Nintendo says Night Trap will never be released on a Nintendo console ever. There's Night Trap in all it's full glory on the Nintendo Switch. Don't hold onto fanboyism, just enjoy what the game was made for as it may likely be your last.I never bought this on 360 or PC, so definitely saves me some money. I'll pick it up in a future sale for $10 or cheaper.This is a 10/10 game for me personally.

Cuphead,John-Paul Jones,PlayStation Universe,https://www.psu.com/reviews/cuphead-ps4-review/," John-Paul Jones / July 29, 2020Cuphead PS4 Review – After nearly three years of waiting PS4 gamers have finally been able to get their paws on Cuphead, Studio MDHR’s extraordinarily opulent and critically adored 1930s styled platforming shooter effort – is it any good though? Well, yes. It’s not only *any* good, it also happens to be very, very good and neatly proves in the intervening three year wait that nothing has aged or been lost in the leap to Sony’s current generation lump of plastic. Make no mistake, Cuphead is absolutely the real deal.Neatly running concurrent with Cuphead’s nutty visuals is its equally surrealist premise. As the titular Cuphead and their friend Mugman (if you’re hooking up with a friend in co-op, but more on that in a bit), these two anthropomorphic kitchen utensils find themselves living an idyllic existence with their Uncle Kettle (stay with me). That is, until the cheeky duo go down to a casino and lose a soul-stakes bet to none other than the devil himself from which they can only extricate themselves from their due by collecting debts from all manner of odd and horrific characters. It is, quite simply, the gloriously mad stuff that 2AM stoner television is made of.It’s certainly fair to say that just about everyone fell in love with Cuphead’s deeply luscious audiovisual presentation first and foremost. Looking like a heady cocktail of prohibition-era, Betty Boop style cartoon visuals aided by watercolor art, cel-shaded design, hefty amounts of LSD and all underscored by a foot-tapping jazz soundtrack which effectively seals the deal on Cuphead’s innate ability to effectively separate the player from reality, there really is nothing that looks or sounds like Cuphead. It is a wholly unique prospect in this regard that will make your visual and audible senses feel like they’ve been put through a technicolor chainsaw blender.As such, it can prove all too easy for many folk to fall in love with Cuphead’s beguilingly attractive aesthetic and the idea of what they want Cuphead to be, rather than what it actually is. The truth is that when you look past Cuphead’s stupendous audiovisual presentation something much deeper reveals itself. A pitch perfect platforming shooter that takes absolutely no prisoners with a level of difficulty that teeters on the brink of being unfair but always manages to pull itself back from the precipice, Cuphead is arguably not for the easily frustrated or those who are new to the Mega Man school of shooting platformer that Cuphead appears to be an avowed student of.Rather than following Capcom’s old-school efforts of having a series of stages that are simply chained up together, Cuphead permits players to wander around a gorgeously realized open-world map that makes the most of Studio MDHR’s superbly evocative and unique setting. From here, players can elect to speak to NPCs, tackle stages in order to progress, uncover secrets and buy upgrades from a scary looking vendor whose voice sounds like how cartoon characters would sound if folk watched cartoons in hell.When Cuphead unfurls the meat and potatoes of its platforming shooter design, it’s a little unexpected to discover just how deeply Studio MDHR have managed to nail the fundamentals. Controlling both Cuphead and Mugman is nothing less than an unfettered joy. Bolstered by a liquid smooth framerate, both characters are ultra-responsive and allow you to nail pixel-perfect leaps, dodges and shots with very little effort.Allowing players to open fire on their foes in a free-form manner or through a rigidly old-school locked 8-way approach, Cuphead troubles the player in earnest with all manner of enemies that attempt to melee the player, drop things on top of them, explode the ground from underneath them and much more besides. While Cuphead invariably nails the fundamentals of the platformer shooter, it’s really in the seemingly everlasting array of enemies and the situations that they put you in from which real sophistication and complexity begins to emerge from Cuphead’s rigid design.Related Content – Best PS4 Indie Games – Excellent Games Everyone Should PlayOften stuffing the screen with all manner foes while demanding that the player negotiate challenging leaps during extremely busy scenes of carnage, it’s easy to see why Cuphead becomes so challenging so very quickly – a fact that is exacerbated by check-pointing mechanics which force you to restart the level as soon as you run out of health.Luckily, Cuphead allows players to perform a jump parry maneuver that allows them to hit or avoid anything in the game world that is colored pink. This means that when things go properly crazy and the screen fills up with health-sapping enemy projectiles, a path to freedom can often be taken by jump-parrying your way through the correctly colored bullets, providing Cuphead’s platforming shooter sensibilities with yet even more depth as a result.Beyond the avoidance of damage, Cuphead’s jump parry system also has some other great uses too. When playing in co-op, the jump parry is used to resurrect a fallen friend and must be timed perfectly in order for it to work (something that’s easier said than done when the screen is overflowing with bullet-murder), while successful parry jumps will refill the player’s EX bar which allows them to pull off powerful attacks. As a result, parrying is as intrinsic to the design bedrock of Cuphead as the basic tenets of jumping and shooting appear to be.Massive screen-filling bosses present a reliable supply of jaw-slackening spectacle as they flood your viewing spectrum with attacks, but really these often towering behemoths are an effective microcosm of everything that Cuphead does so very well from a design perspective. Included in that is how these bosses make use of the parry jump system too.In one such instance the Floral Fury boss – a trio of three very different (and very large) plant based foes will fire seedlings into the air whereupon one of the seedlings is pink. Here, the player can parry jump the pink seedling and destroy it, but failure to do so will cause the seed to hit the ground and transform into a pumpkin flower which will give our trusty hero a whole heap of grief later on in the fight.Another battle meanwhile, has our hero fighting with Ribby and Croakes – two massive boxing frogs that mid-fight inexplicably turn into a huge slot machine which fires out deadly coins. The solution? Parry jump the pink lever and cause the slot machine to cycle, resulting in an all-new enemy attack pattern that allows you to progress through the fight. Much more than just an audiovisual spectacle then, the gargantuan bosses of Cuphead are as much astute tests of player skill as they are ear and eye rending treats.Helping to make things a little easier are the various special attacks and trinkets that you can obtain with your hard won coins from Cuphead’s numerous vendors that scattered across its overworld map. However, in truly fiendish fashion, not all of these items and trinkets provide straight upgrades. For example, one upgrade might change your special attack to a hugely devastating horizontal beam that leaves you vulnerable for a second or two, while another might extend your health but lower your overall attack damage; implementing a neat risk and reward dynamic in the process.So Cuphead then, a resolutely mega-impressive platforming shooter with challenge for days and the sort of LSD infused, 1930s audiovisual presentation that will give you low-key nightmares for weeks. Cuphead is gorgeous, endlessly rewarding and if you have even the smallest inclination to play something different this week with a wholly original style and proper satisfying challenge, then Cuphead is 100% your huckleberry.Cuphead is out now on PS4.Review code kindly provided by publisher.Three years on from its original release on other platforms and there's still nothing like Cuphead. A delirious, LSD-infused trip through a prohibition-era styled cartoon hellscape, Cuphead underscores its utterly unique presentation with a rock solid and fundamentally excellent platform shooter that stands effortlessly shoulder to shoulder with the best in the genre. The wait has been worth it.

Cuphead,Jason Fanelli,COGconnected,http://cogconnected.com/review/cuphead-review/,"A game starring a sentient coffee cup that looks like a 1930s cartoon, plays like Contra or Mega Man, and has a reputation for being incredibly challenging.If I had read that sentence about ten years ago, I might have laughed at it. However, in the year 2017, Cuphead has dropped onto Xbox One and fits that entire description. It’s nostalgia spans multiple decades, from its Steamboat Willie graphic style and music that sounds like it’s from the pre-Depression era to its 1980s’ gameplay and difficulty. Amazingly, with all of its roots firmly planted in the past, Cuphead raises the bar for indie games and platformers alike. The game stars the titular Cuphead and his pal Mugman, who get wrapped up in a bit of a bad deal with the single worst being a deal made with the Devil himself. The heroic mugs are given a choice; resign themselves to eternal servitude to the big bad guy or, go out and collect the souls of other sad sacks who made a deal and haven’t paid up yet. This takes Cup and Mug on a wild adventure across three islands, encountering some pretty insane enemies in the process.______________________________“Amazingly, with all of its roots firmly planted in the past, Cuphead raises the bar for indie games and platformers alike.”First things first, everything about Cuphead’s aesthetic is gorgeous. These hand-drawn cartoony graphics fill the screen with color, taking me back to a more innocent time of eating cereal on a Saturday morning. This is an interactive cartoon, each animation flowing beautifully and smoothly on the screen. The soundtrack drives the on-screen action with its swing and big band roots, making me tap my foot just as much as I tap the buttons on the controller. It’s hard to adequately describe how aesthetically pleasing Cuphead is in action, and while graphics and music can only go so far they give this game a major head start.
Cuphead features two main challenges; single-serve boss fights against bad guys of all shapes and sizes and “Run N’ Gun” platforming stages with an onslaught of smaller enemies blocking the path. Leading Cuphead through these travails is wonderful thanks to the easy and tight controls: running, shooting, dashing, and ducking is all this hero needs to succeed and each is mapped onto the controller in a way that feels natural.


It’s a good thing those controls are so comfortable because Cuphead is plenty challenging on its own without having to worry about confusing button layouts. I’ve killed the little guy more times than I’m comfortable with, racking up a mortality rate I’ve not seen since Ori and the Blind Forest. A lot of the challenge involves learning an enemy’s patterns and reacting to them, sometimes even predicting them, but at any moment one false jump could turn a perfect run into a restart.

On paper that sounds frustrating, but in practice, I’m happy to say it’s not so much rage-inducing as it is inspiring. Here’s the thing; the beauty of Cuphead comes from being challenging in a way that makes me want to keep trying as opposed to making me feel helpless. When I die I think “OK, here’s what I did wrong, let’s try that again” more than “OK, this game is *expletive*ing bull*expletive*, who thought this was a good idea?” That’s not to say I haven’t been frustrated, as the 50+ deaths before reaching World 2 will definitely attest, but it’s never driven me to ragequit and walk away.

The Good

Beautiful art direction
Swinging soundtrack
Simple, yet interesting story
Challenging without being unfair


90

The Bad

A bit short, especially as skills improve
Some may not like the challenge



Cuphead features two main challenges; single-serve boss fights against bad guys of all shapes and sizes and “Run N’ Gun” platforming stages with an onslaught of smaller enemies blocking the path. Leading Cuphead through these travails is wonderful thanks to the easy and tight controls: running, shooting, dashing, and ducking is all this hero needs to succeed and each is mapped onto the controller in a way that feels natural.
It’s a good thing those controls are so comfortable because Cuphead is plenty challenging on its own without having to worry about confusing button layouts. I’ve killed the little guy more times than I’m comfortable with, racking up a mortality rate I’ve not seen since Ori and the Blind Forest. A lot of the challenge involves learning an enemy’s patterns and reacting to them, sometimes even predicting them, but at any moment one false jump could turn a perfect run into a restart.On paper that sounds frustrating, but in practice, I’m happy to say it’s not so much rage-inducing as it is inspiring. Here’s the thing; the beauty of Cuphead comes from being challenging in a way that makes me want to keep trying as opposed to making me feel helpless. When I die I think “OK, here’s what I did wrong, let’s try that again” more than “OK, this game is *expletive*ing bull*expletive*, who thought this was a good idea?” That’s not to say I haven’t been frustrated, as the 50+ deaths before reaching World 2 will definitely attest, but it’s never driven me to ragequit and walk away. There’s a fine line in video games between challenge and frustration, and while Cuphead flirts with that threshold it stays on the right side of the line more than it crosses it. Cuphead impressed me in every facet, from its beautiful art style to its challenging gameplay. Studio MDHR clearly put a ton of love and time into every little detail in this game, and the entire package pays off that effort in a fantastic and challenging experience.

Cuphead,Rosh Kelly,Wccftech,http://wccftech.com/review/cuphead-visual-gameplay/,"Cuphead has been in the works for so long it's hard to tell whether the game deliberately calls back 1930’s animation or if that was when the developers first started working on the game. Either way, Cuphead is finally out, and it beautifully pre-retro artistic design is enough to make this game stand out for years to come.While I’m sure we’ve all been seeing the reports online of issues with the game crashing and a number of bugs hampering play, these seem largely contained to the PC version of the game. On Xbox One, everything flowed smoothly and I didn’t encounter a single crash or noticeable bug.I did, however, encounter a lot of bosses. What I thought was going to be a rock hard platformer with some insane looking bosses was actually more of a boss arena game with the occasional, intermittent platforming world. Think Titan Souls or Yuri, not Rayman. I think I would have preferred more of a chance to explore the absolutely incredible world they created, but the boss fights are addictive and challenging.With so much focus on the dozens of bosses you’ll come across, there is a lot of imagination and variety in the boss fights. Early on you’ll be fighting casino frogs and psychic vegetables before moving on to clown rollercoaster hybrids and, finally, the devil himself. Every boss has their own pace, rhythm and attack patterns to master, and you will have to memorize all those to beat them.In fact, for each boss, I probably had to spend ten minutes or so just memorizing their style. Like so many game bosses, each one changes up their routine multiple times during the battle, forcing you to learn and relearn as you progress. To say that they are difficult might not be very accurate because unlike some games the end is always in sight. Cuphead doesn’t attempt to disguise the weaknesses or the attack pattern of its bosses. In fact, in a lot of the encounters, its melodramatic animation actually highlights what you should be doing. Moves are often telegraphed with more than enough time to react, and each boss has a particular rhythm that syncs with its movements making anticipation easier.All of this does mean that you will have to fight them several times, and even once you’ve learned the nature of the boss, you’ll then be putting your skills to the test, but never feeling overwhelmed. It never seems impossible. That might be why it feels so addictive to keep coming back to. Every death is a lesson you can bring to the next fight, and quitting before you defeat the boss feels wholly unsatisfying when you’re confident you could beat it with one more go.But then, like me, you’ll always be racing to find the next boss anyway. The animation, soundtrack and atmosphere of the game are all just outstanding. Taking inspiration from those old cartoons we’ve seen referenced in media for years, Cuphead lets you live it. Everything from the backgrounds to the way the characters move with big expression gestures feels true to the medium it's emulating. Even the story feels like a throwback to a fabled time that none of us have any first-hand experience with. Having gambled their souls against the devil, Cuphead and his friend Mughead are now collecting souls for Lucifer in an attempt to save themselves. Heavy-handed moral overtones against a backdrop of slightly unnerving characters feel like something out of the 1920’s. Like Bioshock Infinite's Dimwit and Duke, it feels period accurate even if we know that isn’t the case.Having said all that, this won’t be a game for everyone. If it were a platformer, even a challenging one, I’d be quicker to recommend it, but not everyone will be enthralled by a series of boss battles. Unlike Dark Souls, there is no grind that can improve your character before the fights, no levels to ding or equipment to loot. If the idea of playing the same bosses several times each isn’t appealing to you, or getting annoyed that you didn’t quite react in time, there are other games better suited.This is a game designed with challenge in mind, and an easy to goal to lure you. Some things are easy enough to learn while others take a lot of practice. For instance, after nearly a dozen hours as Cuphead, I still haven’t managed to perfect the counter jump. Players can bounce off pink items with a second jump, but it feels strangely unpredictable with some enemies and objects seemingly easier to counter than others. Unfortunately, it is not a game with multiple playstyles in mind so if this doesn’t sound like your kind of game, don’t think you can make it more fun for yourself by finding other ways to beat the bosses.With great design, imaginative enemies and fantastic atmosphere, the only thing that really lets it down is its stiffness.Reviewed on Xbox One (code provided by the publisher). You can buy the game via Amazon.The animation alone is nearly worth the price of admission, but if you want imaginative bosses to fight as well, you're in luck with Cuphead.

Cuphead,Scott Sullivan,COGconnected,https://cogconnected.com/review/cuphead-switch-review/,"Studio MDHR’s highly praised, tough as nails title Cuphead has finally landed on the Switch, and it pleases me immensely to see that the transition went off without a hitch. Featuring the same tight platforming, fantastic bosses, and jazzy big band soundtrack as the original version, the Switch version may even arguably be the definitive way to experience the game, thanks to the grab ‘n go nature of the Switch. There’s a lot to delve into, so let’s spill the tea (or coffee or milk or whatever you may drink out of a cup or mug. I won’t judge you.)The plot for Cuphead feels like it was ripped right out of one of the Fleischer Studio cartoons it draws so heavily from. Cuphead features the titular protagonist and his brother Mugman wandering into the Devil’s Casino, where their luck conveniently runs out right as the getting is good. The duo are about to lose their souls, but the Devil instead gives them a proposal; track down the other debtors, give them a proper walloping, and the porcelain-headed pair would be off the hook. A simple premise, but it stands on its own two legs without any issue, thanks in part to the gorgeous animation and tight, responsive game-play. Emulating an animation style known as “rubber hose”, each and every aspect of the game is animated in this fashion. Screenshots honestly do not do the game justice, and it is an absolute treat to see it in motion. Bosses are lively, multi-phase encounters with each phase having new attacks and even grander transformations. They are also accompanied with their own beautiful backdrops and snappy music tracks that are catchy enough to stick in your head long after the credits roll. I really cannot stress just how freaking beautiful Cuphead is from an artistic standpoint, and it’s always nice to see that games don’t have to have photo-realistic graphics in order to stand out. Thankfully, Cuphead isn’t just a pretty face as there’s a seriously challenging game underneath this 1930’s-esque exterior.Cuphead is as gorgeous as it is difficult. Harkening back to old school shooters like Contra, Studio MDHR made it their mission to create a game that captured that old school feel, while also giving it that snazzy coat of paint. The Run ‘N Gun stages are a nice callback to these sort of games, without feeling too difficult, but the bosses could be seen as a little unfair due to how each phase’s attacks do have a degree of randomness to them, but each boss really boils down to how well you can recognize the patterns and adapt to their attacks. The Run ‘n Gun stages are a little tame by comparison, but they are still challenging and a welcome break from each of the bosses who are easily the star of the show.  Each island has a number of bosses to challenge, and while they vary in difficulty pretty wildly each island feels like a smooth progression for the most part, culminating in a few bosses that are easily some of the most creative challenges in the game.I must say, this is one hell of a port. Unity is a little notorious for being used to create games that are a little unoptimized, but Studio MDHR did a fantastic job with the port/overhauling of the game. They not only managed to reduce the game’s original file-size from a beefy 11GB to a neat and tidy 3GB, but the game runs like a dream on the Switch. At no point did I experience frame drops, so I was able to seamlessly get my ass kicked by Dr. Kahl’s Robot (seriously, screw that boss) and get right back into the action with little delay. The only real difference I’d seen was a bit of a longer load time than the PC version which I initially played, but we’re talking a mere seconds difference in this case; it’s not a deterrent in anyway whatsoever. It’s easy to get back into a Run ‘n Gun stage or a boss battle, because there’s a good chance you’ll be doing it more than once. This version also brings some fresh content in the way of new character animations, fully animated cutscenes, and even some additional secret boss routes. These routes aren’t aren’t anything world-changing, but they provide some pretty notable differences and are worth experiencing at least once to see how things get mixed up.  It would be nice to see all of the bosses get this treatment, but it appears only a few got these new routes from what I was able to find.It may be two years old at this point, but that doesn’t change how good of a game it is. Studio MDHR worked themselves to the bone to make this dream a reality since the reveal back in 2014 when it was first teased and to see it not only be successful but to flourish is a heartwarming story in this massive industry. We definitely haven’t seen the last of this plucky pair, as DLC is on the way, but for the time being Cuphead will take you a bit of time to finish. If you’re a fan of old-school animation or like to be challenged, or even both, then check out this one of a kind gem.**Switch Review code provided by publisher** Developer: Studio MDHRPublisher: Studio MDHR"

Cuphead is this deceptively charming and uber difficult platformer shooter that made waves when it launched exclusively on Xbox and PC back in 2017. Someone must have done a deal with the devil, because eventually it came to the Switch in 2019—despite the developer originally saying it wouldn’t come to other platforms—and a surprise launch last week brought the retro-cartoon-inspired frustration machine to PS4 players at long last. Having not played it on any other platforms, I approached this PS4 release with fresh eyes, and despite years of built hype that could have let me down, Cuphead did not disappoint. Rather, screenshots and video couldn’t ever really do justice to just what it feels like to play this retro cartoon for myself.Cuphead masks its often brutal difficulty with an incredible animation style that borders on somewhere between being both adorable and terrifying. It’s a work of creative genius to see how the boss encounters bizarrely morph over time adding as much difficulty as they do weirdness. The story begins as thus: Cuphead and Mugman get into a bit of gambling trouble after sneaking into a casino owned by the devil himself. The only way to repay their debts is to collect on the soul contracts of other debtors who have unsettled accounts with the demon king. This is the main goal of Cuphead; a series of tough boss encounters against a bunch of bizarre characters, most often anthropomorphic inanimate objects or crazy creatures with a variety of strange powers and forms.Perhaps best boiled down to “bullet-hell platformer,” that descriptor doesn’t quite do Cuphead justice. It’s far less of a platformer than I had initially anticipated. Though there are platforming levels used to collect coins to buy various power-ups and modifiers, the main stages are straight-to-the-point boss encounters. Most of these can be completed in around two minutes or less, but that’s considering a successful run. In practice, it’ll probably take you far longer to defeat the bosses. Given 3 HP per level, players must take on myriad bizarre attacks and evolutions from enormous villains that steal the show in looks and panache. With nary a word, each becomes an instantly classic character and the cause of most of your controller-rending frustrations.It’s reputation had me expecting a tough game, and while yes, Cuphead is hard, it also has a specific set of patterns and a learnability to the variety of boss mechanics. While any given boss may seem insurmountable at first glance, failure is the key to pushing forward. As I played each boss encounter, I found myself getting further and further each time. I’d learn from my mistakes. Rarely was I surprised by what I would call cheap deaths. While there were some surprises in terms of how the boss fights morphed and changed over time, the encounters are both short enough and consistent enough to allow the player to effectively learn from those mistakes and use those lessons to succeed. Seeing “Knockout!” flash across the screen is made genuinely exciting by know you personally overcame that challenge. It feels like a real accomplishment and feat of player skill.The farther one gets into Inkwell Isle, the more fascinating surprises crop up. Going from your first homegrown boss encounter against a bunch of angry vegetables in a garden to a frog and toad pair who eventually morph into a rather dangerous slot machine to a crazy clown and his army of evil carnival rides and balloon animals. Each new boss mechanic managed to by surprising and overwhelming, but always delightful and eventually surmountable despite the seeming impossibility. Cuphead nails that ever important balance of being tough, but never unfairly so. And with how often bosses shift through phases, the fights never became dull, even on repeated playthroughs.There are a series of upgrades and alternate mechanics besides the platforming and shooting—which Cuphead adorably does by snapping his fingers—but none ever feel like the golden ticket to victory, rather offering small variations to playstyle, often at the cost of other things. One upgrade adds 1 HP, but lowers the damage you do, making encounters take longer. Another might allow the shots to home in on targets, but similarly lower overall damage output. Each is a tradeoff, meant to enhance the gameplay and give the player options without blatantly overpowering them to victory. I never felt that any equipped ability was the cause of my win against any certain boss, but some at least helped me be a bit more comfortable behind the controller.A parry mechanic also allows Cuphead to smack any pink objects or enemies on the screen, gaining boosts to his EX meter for special moves (which too can be customized in various ways as you earn new abilities). Again, this is not a golden ticket to success and is something that must be learned. The timing of the parry can be a little unforgiving, and depending on the context, needs to be used in various different ways to best take advantage of the situation. Some fights I felt I needed every parry I did, while others I completely avoided the mechanic altogether—though it does factor into your final grade for each level.But I cannot understate how much the audiovisual theming of 1930s cartoons manages to tie the whole thing together. Through every death that led to moments of learning and victory that came from repeated failures, I continued to grin because Cuphead is simply a treat to behold. Its jazzy soundtrack keeps things upbeat. The “rubber hose” style of animation—which is what that era of very stretchy and curvy animation is called—is in constant motion, bouncing in time with the jaunty piano riffs and sax solos that underscore each moment. Cuphead feels like it could just be an animation, and sometimes I have to remind myself that I am in control. It’s that stunning, and you’d be hard-pressed to find anything else quite like it.Cuphead perfectly balances it’s simple nature, difficult mechanics, and audiovisual style for a game that’s rather unmatched. It’s a work of creative genius that allows the player to feel a sense of accomplishment through learning to overcome tough boss mechanics, and the cartoon visuals and big personalities of each keep them entertaining throughout repeated play. There’s simply nothing else like Cuphead, and even three years after its initial Xbox release, it deserves to be experienced by the PlayStation crowd who may have missed out the first time around.Cuphead PS4 review code provided by publisher.

Cuphead,Gabriel Zamora,PCMag,https://www.pcmag.com/review/356801/cuphead-for-pc,"My career has taken me through an eclectic assortment of fields, and connected me with people from all walks of life. This experience includes construction, professional cooking, podcasting, and, of course, writing. I’ve been typing up geeky takes since 2009, ultimately landing a freelancing position at PCMag. This blossomed into a full-time tech analyst position in 2021, where I lend my personal insight on the matters of web hosting, streaming music, mobile apps, and video games. Cuphead pays homage to old school animation, as well as side-scrolling video game shooters of old. While it lacks the stage-heavy mayhem of other games in the genre, Cuphead more than makes up for it with its vicious boss battles.


Cuphead is a charming run-and-gun/shoot-'em-up hybrid that channels Konami's iconic Contra series, while also taking heavy inspiration from the rubber hose animation style that was prominent during 1920s- and 1930s-era cartoons. If you're familiar with the Contra series' fast-paced gameplay, then Cuphead should feel right up your alley: the titular protagonist and his brother Mugman must best a wide variety of perilous stages and bosses to complete their quest. Cuphead lacks the expansive level design featured in Contra and other genre classics, but the hardcore action game gives you a beefy list of complex and satisfying boss fights to overcome, a la Treasure's beloved Alien Soldier.Inkwell Isle is a magical realm where people, animals, plants, and inanimate objects all live in cartoon harmony. One day, Cuphead and his brother Mugman venture into the Devil's casino, in a storybook-like location that mimes Pinocchio's adventures in Pleasure Isle. Cuphead and Mugman are blinded by riches, and eventually gamble their souls away to the Devil. Instead of claiming their souls, however, the Devil has the boys collect from debtors.It turns out that quite a few of Inkwell Isle's denizens owe the Devil their souls, and they are none too happy to part with them. Thus, the stage is set for Cuphead and Mugman to travel across the game's regions, dispatching mooks and collecting the souls of massive, multi-form bosses.The controls are simple and easy to learn. Cuphead can shoot in eight directions, as well as crouch, dash, jump, and perform a special attack to deal bonus damage. The game's tutorial teaches you how to apply those actions, and that's all you really need to know to complete the game; everything after that boils down to pattern recognition and practice.Stages are divided into run-and-gun sections and boss fights. The levels resemble those in the classic 8- and 16-bit Contra games: you run from left to right, shooting down waves of spawning enemies and hazards, and jumping over pitfalls to reach the goal. Sadly, there are fewer run-and-gun stages than boss fights, but they are filled with unique enemies, and occasionally present interesting challenges to keep the formula fresh. One stage, for example, has you switch between walking on the ground and the ceiling to avoid enemies, while making precarious jumps. Another has you fleeing a giant Cyclops in a race to the goal. Yet another features a brutally difficult auto-scrolling section that bombards you with enemy attacks. None of these stages break new genre ground, but they are tough, enjoyable, and visually stunning.While Cuphead's run-and-gun segments are enjoyable, its strength lies in the boss fights. Each of Inkwell Isle's three areas has five or more bosses that must be defeated before you can move on to the next area. Boss encounters are lengthy, multi-stage gauntlets that demand mastery of both offensive and defensive tactics. Early boss fights see the big bads repeat one or two attacks during each form, and only switch through three or so forms throughout the fight. That said, some boss fights having five or more forms that pepper you with intense bullet patterns.You have three health points by default, which lets you make three mistakes in any stage or boss fight before dying. This forces you to familiarize yourself with the enemy patterns and boss mechanics, because there are no mid-level checkpoints. If you lose all your health during an attempt, you need to restart from the beginning of that stage. To take some of the edge off of the difficulty, you can purchase upgrades with coins you collect throughout the game, which give you new shot types, health perks, and defensive abilities. A chaser shot, for example, act like homing missiles, but they are weaker than Cuphead's normal peashooter shot. The spread shot deals more damage than basic shots, but has extremely limited range. Other perks include the smoke bomb, which makes your dash invincible, and the heart, which gives you one additional point of health, but drops your damage output slightly. You can customize Cuphead to suit your own play style, but by the end of the game you should be able to purchase all perks.Cuphead's most unique mechanic is its parry slap, which lets you deflect projectiles by double jumping into them. It rewards you with a special attack card, which you spend to perform power super moves. Parrying is limited to pink projectiles exclusively, so it won't work on most bullets thrown your way. Generally, pink projectiles are incorporated into a boss' assault to allow you to build up special attack cards throughout the fight, however I find that parrying is much too risky to attempt in most scenarios. With such a limited number of health points, and with the onslaught of bullets and attacks generally thrown your way, it is almost always safer to build up your special attack cards through shooting and avoiding damage normally, rather than parrying and risking damage.Cuphead also has two-player co-op action, but this is limited to local play. In co-op mode, Cuphead and Mugman each have their own special attack meters and health, so each player can carry their own weight without being a burden to the other. In addition, if one player dies, the surviving player can parry slap the dead player's ghost to give him or her an extra health point. This becomes increasingly harder to do the more it happens during a fight, so by the third time, the ghost will usually leave the screen much too quickly to be revived. Still, it's a highly satisfying way to play Cuphead, and is a good way to mitigate some of the game's difficulty.I thoroughly enjoyed Cuphead's gameplay and challenge, but I would have preferred if each boss had a corresponding stage associated with it, like in the Contra or Mega Man   games. In addition, Cuphead is a relatively short game, and can be completed in an hour or two if you know what you're doing. A few extra stages would have given the game a nice chunk of additional length. This is more of a minor nitpick, however, but it is something I would like to see if Cuphead ever gets a sequel.When glancing at any random screenshot of Cuphead, the parallels to old Fleisher Studios and Walt Disney animation are all too obvious. Classic cartoon characters, such as Popeye the Sailor, Betty Boop, and Steamboat Willie, all come to mind. Even Cuphead's fictional setting, Inkwell Isle, plays homage to the old cartoons: Fleisher Studios was originally named Inkwell Studios in the 1920s.I encountered no slowdown or hiccups while playing Cuphead on my gaming desktop that's powered by an Nvidia GeForce GTX 970 GPU and an Intel i5-4690 CPU. However, Cuphead does suffer from the occasional crash and a few bugs. If you beat certain bosses too quickly for example, their animation might hang or get stuck in an awkward cycle before moving on to the next phase. Another odd bug causes your controller to vibrate uncontrollably at times.I played Cuphead with a controller, and the game lets you to extensively customize the button layout to suit your liking. Keyboard controls are viable, and just as customizable, but I preferred the gamepad for its old-school feel. Its simple controls are perfect for an arcade stick, too.Cuphead is a part of Microsoft's Play Anywhere Initiative, which means you get a free Xbox One version if you buy the game via the Windows 10 Store. Please note that Cuphead is also available for purchase via Steam, but buying it there doesn't net you a free Xbox One version. Instead, you'll enjoy Steam Acheivements and Steam Cloud Saves.Cuphead is an impressive tour de force that pairs the classic appeal of the Contra games with the visual aesthetic of classic cartoons. Cuphead is not a particularly long game, but it demands mastery that keeps you playing for a long time. Once you clear the normal difficulty, the game introduces an expert mode that switches up boss patterns and increases their health to make them genuine battles of attrition. For the relatively low $19.99 price tag, Cuphead has much to enjoy, for old school run-and-gun fans and animation fans alike.Cuphead pays homage to old school animation, as well as side-scrolling video game shooters of old. While it lacks the stage-heavy mayhem of other games in the genre, Cuphead more than makes up for it with its vicious boss battles.Sign up for Lab Report to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.
