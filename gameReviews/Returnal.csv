Our experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you. Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. What is it? A roguelike third-person shooter with a strong bullet hell lineage. Expect to pay: £50 / $60Developer: HousemarquePublisher: PlayStation PC Reviewed on: 64-bit Windows 10, Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080, AMD Ryzen 9 5900X, 32GB RAMMultiplayer: Co-op onlyLink: Steam page (opens in new tab)In 1996, Housemarque released Super Stardust (opens in new tab), and for two decades it honed the top down arcade shooter. In 2017, it declared ""ARCADE IS DEAD"" (opens in new tab)—there was no money left in it, and the developer would be ""moving on to new genres"". Returnal is the result, a big budget roguelike that kicks off a new era for the studio. The twist? It's… basically an arcade shooter.Okay, that's a little unfair. Strictly speaking, it's a third-person roguelike shooter—the camera tight over your shoulder, not high above, with runs progressing you through a shifting alien world, rather than being an opportunity to chase high scores. But the more you play, the more it feels like a wolf in sheep's clothing, using some of the trappings of a popular modern genre to smuggle in the gameplay Housemarque is more known for. It's a game with one foot in the studio's past and another in its future—and, despite the game's strengths, that's not always a comfortable position to stand in.Things kick off with an astronaut—Selene—crash-landing on the alien planet of Atropos. After some fraught encounters with the hostile wildlife, she discovers she's trapped in a time loop—if she dies, she simply wakes up again at the crash site. And not only that, but she's been trapped for a lot longer than she remembers, a fact chillingly proved by the frequent discoveries of her own past corpses, complete with audio logs full of the crazed ramblings of her past lives. It's a perfect narrative set-up for a roguelike, contextualising your repeated runs through Atropos' dangerous levels as part of a continuous story—similar to Deathloop (opens in new tab) or particularly Hades (opens in new tab).Each run consists of a series of rooms—some containing loot, secrets and traps, but most bursting with furious enemies. Combat is fast, frantic and deadly, a furious, leaping dance of aliens and projectiles. Survival means always being on the move, sprinting and dashing as you get your shots in while you can, and avoiding getting hit at all costs so you can maintain your vital Adrenaline—a stacking buff that vanishes if you lose any health. It's exhilarating stuff, chaotic enough to always keep your blood pumping, but precise enough to demand mastery. And more than just showing Housemarque's strengths as a studio with a long history of skill-based games, it specifically evokes arcade shooters. Projectiles are big and slow-moving, but frequently fill the screen—it very much feels like a third-person take on bullet hell as you weave between shots. Alt-fire modes on your guns feel like arcade power-ups, launching waves of shots or blazing beams. Even the visuals evoke a meeting of two worlds. The alien landscape is beautifully bleak and weird, a foreboding realm whose techno-organic creatures and machines take clear inspiration from the Alien films and the art of HR Giger. But against that quiet, creepy backdrop, combat is an explosion of noise and light, a barrage of neon bullets and blasts straight out of Super Stardust. Even two years on from Returnal's original launch on PS5, the combination is visually stunning, and, importantly, runs smooth as butter. No matter how busy things got on screen—and trust me, they got extremely busy—I was always hitting a consistent 60FPS even at max settings. Just what you want for a game this focused on fast, precise action. Elsewhere, unfortunately, the game struggles to find a similar balance. Despite the roguelike structure, there's a clear reluctance to let the RPG elements traditional for the genre have too much effect on the very skill-based combat. There's almost no persistent progression, and even within a run, boons that you earn frequently feel minor. Combined with the long length of runs, the result is that it's very possible to die after 40 minutes of play having made no progress at all in your overall goal. It often feels like the best strategy is to simply rush to your goal as fast as possible, rather than taking time to explore and search for loot. Runs are full of risk/reward decisions—should you open this chest, knowing it might give you a debuff? Should you enter this challenge room, attempting a tough fight for extra rewards? Should you brave that dangerous trap to get the health pick-up inside? The problem is, because of that focus on skill over RPG progression, the rewards are usually meagre, and the risk is often too harsh. Combat is so difficult and punishing that the wrong debuff or too much damage taken ahead of an encounter can easily tank a run no matter how far in you are. It's simply not worth rolling the dice on that for the sake of a slight increase to your health (in a game that demands you simply never get hit anyway), one of many incrementally better guns, or one of the artifact buffs that, due to their specificity, I found often never came into play at all. It's particularly grating once you reach one of the game's bosses. Each one is a glorious bullet hell fever dream, and beating them necessitates learning their attacks and practicing the appropriate dodges and counters, often with lots of trial and error. During an attempt it's a blast, but the roguelike structure means it can take hours between each go, as you fight your way to their room, try to keep yourself at high enough health to have a chance, stock up on consumables you'll need, search for a decent weapon… After all that, you could still die in a few hits, and be right back at square one. I have to stress—in the moment, when you're bouncing between platforms, blasting aliens and dashing through their attacks, it looks and feels excellent. It's some of the best and most engaging action you'll find on PC. But it feels like that need to present it as something other than a pure test of twitch reflexes has led to it being housed in totally the wrong structure. There's a real sense that, though the developer perfectly understands how to stage a fight, it really doesn't get what makes people love roguelikes—and certainly never figured out how to make that gel with what people love about arcade shooters.The result is a game that, though frequently fun and hugely satisfying to conquer, also demands far more patience than is really fair to ask. Even the story, despite that promising start and some wonderfully thick horror atmosphere, ends up being a frustratingly vague tapestry that feels more aimed at the creators of 20 minute YouTube explainers than the average player. A certain breed of dedicated gaming masochist will revel in Returnal's lengthy and unwavering challenge, but I suspect most will either wish there was more meaningful RPG progression, or that it was simply a series of score-attack levels without all that roguelike padding in between. The irony is that the game's post-release DLC, bundled in free with the PC port, offers a glimpse at what could have been. The Tower of Sisyphus is an endless survival challenge that simply warps you from room to room for brief but frantic fights. Rewards come thick and fast, a high score system gives you a new reason to hone your skills, and runs are quick and satisfying. It gets right to the meat of what the game is good at, and I found myself wishing it had been the template for the whole game, instead of just a sideshow. For better and worse, this is a game defined by Housemarque's struggle with its own identity. On the one hand, it's a frenzied shooter that brings to bear decades of arcade experience into a supremely satisfying and frequently beautiful experience. On the other, it's a half-hearted grab at a more popular genre that fails to understand what makes its fellow roguelikes work so well. If this truly is a new era for Housemarque, I can only hope its next project has a clearer vision of that future. Demanding but excellent combat and gorgeous visuals sit awkwardly in a half-baked roguelike structure.

Returnal,Chris Tapsell,Eurogamer,https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-04-29-returnal-review-magnificent-and-monstrous,"Groundhog die.
Sometimes, when you talk about games, it helps to think about their personalities: what do they want from you? How do they behave? What role do you play in the relationship here, and what do they think of you in return? Normally this is quite easy. Think about it and you'll find games will happily fall into their roles - courthouse jester, self-serious actor, cerebral engineer (I'm not going to say which is which). But in this case it's been tricky. Returnal is hard to pin down. But pinned it down I have: Returnal has the personality of a furious cat with a sore tooth, and it's your job to be its vet. I'm saying this because Returnal is good - it's so good! - but it is incredibly reluctant to let you find that out. It hides its best moments, buries them, beneath repetition and frustration and a byzantine UI, but those moments are just extraordinary. Euphoric, even! It's in its interest and my own for it to just let me play it, but Returnal is a video game that does not want to be played.The history is going to be important here, if we're going to pull all of this apart. Returnal is the latest from Housemarque, the Finnish team behind masterly arcade-style shoot-em-ups like Resogun, twin-stick shooters like Dead Nation and Alienation, and the superlative Nex Machina. It's their first ""triple-A"" one though, and with big budget comes big scope. Returnal's is vast - it wants to be everything. It's a roguelite, insofar as death returns you to the start and the dungeonlike world procedurally changes with each run through it. But it's also a metroidvania, handing out new abilities after boss kills which open up new paths. And it's a third-person shooter, obviously. But also a bullet-hell arcade game. And a first-person narrative horror. And a soulslike. It picks from Ridley Scott, Eugene Jarvis, Hidetaka Miyazaki, H.R. Giger. From Metroid, P.T., Control. From Defender and Vanquish. Pick your poison - Returnal stocks everything and almost everything is sublime.Story first. Returnal's story - which I should warn you I haven't finished and probably never will, but more on that later - is fantastic, at least so far. And I say story in the widest possible terms, because Returnal's a rare case of a game that understands the unmatched breadth of what a game's story can be. The setup is you, Selene, crash on a deeply hostile planet called Atropos for an unknown reason, seemingly defying an order. The execution is through everything the game has. Selene is voiced with stern perfection by Jane Perry, (with likeness from Anne Beyer): cold, assertive, a scouting warrior-scientist who's first reaction is to catalogue and enquire, to talk to the monsters before shooting them to bits. Through her lens the world is all flora and fauna, but gradually that lens is smashed. She's chasing the ""white shadow"", a signal broadcast from somewhere on the planet that she is guided to, or lured toward, by the vision of a 20th century astronaut. This becomes her God of the Gaps, the thing that answers what science can't: why, for instance, each time Selene dies she wakes up, back at her crashed ship, back at the beginning of the trail, the end of which she assumes must be at that white shadow. There's a spooky house you visit along the way (where suddenly you're in first-person), there are audio logs of past and future dead Selenes, suffering varying levels of madness (there's a Dark Souls-y element to this: some found bodies mirror the deaths of other players, whom you can choose to ""salvage"" for resources or ""avenge"" with a mini boss fight) and there are xeno-archives to tour and xeno-runes to collect that offer varying dollops of a kind of space-Greek mythology. It's very Remedy, if we're doing references again - disquiet and implied horror, but never overt. (Which makes sense: Returnal shares talent with Remedy in narrative designers like Gregory Louden and Eevi Korhonen, and what talent they are).But again, this is really the beginning of what counts for story. It's also the mastery of the other things, the miscellaneous: the sounds of it, the squelching, dripping, gurning noise of the world that tells you it's rotten, putrid, old. It's the fog, the swirls of sand, the thick, polluted haze, the retro-future menus and computers - Returnal is always partially obscured, hard to read, half-intelligible. The use of quiet and echoed sound, robotic honks or gurgled growls through smog and forest, alien life that's dormant, but very much waiting to come alive (and subsequently pull you apart). The third biome, a long-dead, incomprehensibly vast robo-citadel, is a work of art, arguably the best sci-fi world I've visited in a game. Even the controller itself is in on it, clicking and rolling and crunching wonderfully in the hand, doing the whole ""first big exclusive on next gen"" thing by frankly just showing off. These are small things, but things that pull in the direction of the story, brushstrokes going in the same direction, and this stuff is hard, as is obvious from the rareness of such cohesion and the games that pull it off.What Returnal's going for with all this, and achieving, is a sense of hostility. A hostile planet, Selene's hostile thoughts, a place you do not want to be. It continues in the action, although the actual results here are mixed. Returnal has six ""biomes"", each with a boss at the end that blocks your progress to the next. Each biome is made up of a series of areas, almost rooms, which reshuffle each time you die and are linked by two kinds of door, a ""main path"" one that links to other main rooms and objectives, and a ""side path"" one that links to items or other ""discoveries"" (crucially, these are not always good, but again more on that later). In the first biome, a murky, midnight blue forest, all that can make navigating a little tricky; the map is fine, if not the clearest, the world is dark, if unproblematic on a fancy OLED with HDR and all the luxuries (I suspect this will be a recurring theme this generation), and in the early stages one room can blur into the next, at least until you've been through them all so many times that even the shortest stretches of connective tissue become committed to muscle memory.This is fine - it's all hellish ambiance and I'm all about that - but artful hostility starts to feel like actual hostility after a little while. Take checkpoints: did you know there are checkpoints? Well there are and there aren't. Returnal purposely avoids explaining things properly, and it takes pleasure in encouraging you to gamble on an unknown device and then punish you for doing so. So you might see a room with some kind of body-shaped alien device in that says something about restructuring biological thingymajigs, and that it has an extortionate Ether cost attached (Ether is an ultra-rare resource that is the only thing to carry over from one run to the next), and you might think, on your first lengthy run in a while, ""better not take the risk"" - or you might spend a fortune on it but be right near the start of the run, and realise it was a total waste, four or five hours of resources down the drain. Either way, once you do, you will discover something else: that checkpoints only work once per run, so you better be sure when you spend half a day's resources on one.Beyond that of course it's the action. This is not the same as other Housemarque games. In fact it's not really the same as anything. It's an odd hybrid. Selene's movement is slick, taught, poised, immaculately responsive. Sprinting is superhuman. Dashes, with infinite use and very low cooldowns, grant you i-frames - invincibility from anything - while weapons work via overheating rather than ammo. Enemies pump out waves of various orbs, with the odd laser, the odd rapid melee, the odd explosion, and they're fine, but the majority of combat doesn't really get above that. Guns are satisfying but they are all just guns, not getting distinct enough until you're about halfway through the game. Melee is satisfying but, beyond the odd damage boost or something similar, I haven't found anything exotic enough to call a functioning melee build. Builds in general feel less like builds and more a mess of blessings and curses, too randomly determined to push you to a particular style of play. The result is in the inbetween, the moments that make the bulk of your playtime, Returnal's combat is ever so slightly disappointing. It's a game of endurance, about keeping on the move and not making silly mistakes, scrounging around for scraps of health or a gun with marginally higher rate-of-fire. The systems, of which there are so many, don't really congeal into anything recognisable until you do fight a boss, at which point - BANG! Housemarque.Like Resogun or Nex Machina, Returnal is actually best at its hardest - when it's beyond hard, even, the point where there's so much on the screen you have to enter a kind of trance, hypnotised by swirls of projectiles, particles, bolts of instant death, Bobby Krlic's screaming, raging techno-metal blurring with giants' roars and conjuring a kind of subliminal survival beat, a rhythm to which you must stick in order to dodge, dash, fire, reload. Play these sections on instinct and the unconscious mind and you'll come out the other side of difficulty into something else entirely, something oddly serene. These are where you see the history as heritage, how it's more than an obligation or slavish devotion but something to be protected and preserved. It is totally unmatched.And then what a thud back down to Earth. In comparison to those climaxes Returnal's regular combat can't find the right pacing, can't find a beat. It's stop-start and it spikes dramatically, flipping erratically from banal to cruel and often feeling like it wants to trip you up or catch you out - to piss you off, frankly, which it often does. This is where the hostility returns again: Returnal nicks Gears of War's active reload (why haven't more games pilfered that?) but it insists on making it more risky, more awkward, more of a gamble. Reload is mapped to the same trigger as fire, which means watching every spray, every tap, to ensure you pause and restart at the perfect moment lest you screw yourself into a jam. It maps aim to a half-pull of the left trigger, your super-like Alt-Fire to a full pull, which feels like a superfluous skill-check on how hard you grip your controller (turns out for me: like my life depends on it).Further still its Returnal's inscrutable UI, which is a purposeful play for immersion in Selene's own brain fog - shoutouts in particular to the early-game map, which landed me in an accidental rematch with the first boss, and the laughably small cooldown meter for your Alt-Fire, a teenie tiny square which must be about four pixels wide. A cooldown meter for ants.Most troublesome of all though is the world itself, the way its arranged, the way you navigate it, the incentives it creates. Atropos is almost a masterwork. Depending on what you're doing it expands and contracts. When you first enter a new biome it's vast. You don't know how far away the end is, you don't know what lies the other side of any door, down any secret passage, in any chest. It takes hours upon hours to explore. There are scores of set areas in the procedural pool that each run pulls from. Everything is lethal. Everything is alien and new. At this point it's sublime - but there are just six biomes, and they each only make that first impression once. Beyond that, when you reach a boss, it contracts, the game folding in on itself, almost losing its own confidence: a shortcut makes itself available to you, and suddenly you've no urge to explore, no incentive to, crucially, because of the risk.From then until you beat that boss, you are trapped in a miserable loop - clearly intentional; this is Selene's fate, after all - and it makes for a dilemma where both options equal pain. Everything you do in Returnal becomes a gamble, and the currency you wager with is your time. Do I take my time and grind the first world, that you must always necessarily trudge through on death, likely earning a larger health bar, more consumables, more single-run passives? You'd think always yes - but with almost every other pickup comes a gamble, via Returnal's Malevolence system, where some items inform you they are essentially cursed and have a set chance of whacking you with a suit malfunction (e.g.: you can't swap weapons until you kill 15 enemies; healing is halved until you kill four enemies at once, et cetera) or chipping away your health. And there's always the very real risk of death by mini boss or misadventure. The alternative on the fork is to sprint straight to the boss, which might take half an hour as opposed to one or two, but gives you a much worse chance at actually beating it. Dare I try it without an expanded health bar? It becomes a question of not ""what's the most fun?"" but ""what feels the least worst?"" Grinding for two hours and getting screwed by bad luck, or banging your head against the wall for several half-hour runs in a row? This is what's stopped me from getting to the end. Exhaustion, over actual difficulty. Bosses only take a couple of tries to beat, some even go down on first attempt, but getting back to them is so arduous, so unpleasant. Suddenly all the peerless beauty of Atropos' worlds becomes overfamiliar, Selene goes totally quiet - no more new fauna to log - and it's just you and the same old monsters. Everyone's extraordinary work on this game begins to unnecessarily grate. It comes back to the combat. And the hostility, for that matter. And the history. And the ambition of what Returnal is really after. This is the ugly side of the roguelite rearing its head, in cahoots with the ugly side of the arcade. There's an implication, from the way Returnal is structured, that it must be harsh to be authentic; that to make permadeath less permanent by, say, making carry-over resources a bit more viable to grind, or the bad luck a bit less punishing, would be to water it down. In fact it would be the opposite. This is what good roguelites do: they recognise that getting very far on a very good run and then dying - by bad luck, bad play, or just losing focus for one moment - doesn't feel great, and so they load the best parts of the games into the run itself, as opposed to the end goal. This is why Hades' randomised builds always make you feel like a god at a minimum, why FTL tells its stories through the impossible blind decisions themselves, why Spelunky makes sure that when it kills you, it kills you with an anecdote: ""I used all my ropes and then fell down a hole"". The genre itself is hostile; it's the game's job to invite you back.Returnal gets halfway to doing it. It is full of real, bona fide video game magic, but with each death it becomes less special, more mundane, and this is why it feels so difficult to pick up the controller again, why Returnal feels like it doesn't want to be played. But the magic it does have is transcendent. And so I do still want to play it - whether Returnal likes it or not.You're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!

A crashed ship on a mysterious planet. No goals other than to chase a signal called the White Shadow. Only your wits and the discarded pistol of what looks like your own corpse to help you survive. By the time you’ve acquainted yourself with this roguelike’s basics, just about getting a handle of how quickly stranded astronaut Selene can glide through environments, a luminescent monster comes along to body you and start the real task of trying to break out of this Alien-meets-Groundhog-Day nightmare. Release date: April 30, 2021
Platform(s): PS5
Developer: Housemarque
Publisher: Sony Interactive EntertainmentWhile Ridley Scott’s seminal classic might be the game’s most obvious visual reference - from the putrid egg-shaped wildlife to the dull green hum of the game’s menus - Returnal as a whole isn’t quite as easy to nail down. While the action is pure bullet-hell twitch adrenaline, with your screen teeming with fluorescent orbs that stand in stark contrast to the harsh, dark colors of the environment, the game’s story is elliptically told through brief, ominous flashes of life back on Earth. Add on a structure that is reminiscent of Hades, where death gives you just a scrap of new information each time, it all adds up to a real grab bag of influences. While they initially seem at odds with each other, they come together to create one of Sony’s most beguilingly weird blockbusters in a long time.The main reason you’ll want to come to Returnal is the game’s combat, an evolution of Housemarque’s signature run and gun style that introduces a significant risk/reward dynamic. Killing enemies will increase Selene’s Adrenaline levels, which grant perks such as bigger active reload windows or enhanced melee attacks, but take one hit and you’ll have to build them up again. Add on a combination of well-balanced weapons and challenging enemies, which really sings once the screen is overflowing, and it’s a combat loop you’ll happily trap yourself in. In terms of the arsenal that Selene can find scattered around, although you start with a discarded pistol, there’s a range of guns to quickly discover that each comes with considered strengths and weaknesses. Over time, you’ll develop your own style of play thanks to the permanent traits you can unlock with them. For instance, I tend to prioritize the Electropylon Driver (EPD), which deals damage over time and can be used to lay traps for enemies, with spikes that dig into the ground and a current connecting them if they’re close enough. This allows me to keep a healthy distance from enemies, knowing I can retreat and that they’ll still be taking damage if I’ve got a few hits on them. However, the EPD isn’t a great close-range weapon, and considering there are plenty of foes who will rush me, diving at my feet and exploding on impact, it means I have to be wary of letting myself get swarmed. Of course, if you’re more aggressive, you can focus on upgrading the traits of the Spitmaw Blaster, a powerful shotgun that’s devastating up close and a peashooter at range. No strategy is perfect and that allows for you to tackle Returnal in a way that suits you, without ever feeling like you’re getting an easy ride with your weapon. As you fight through the game’s six biomes, enemies present a real challenge, from cannon fodder that you’ll take out in a couple of hits to more complex sub-bosses that require agility and aggression to overcome. No creature represents an insignificant challenge, and each can take you down quickly, especially early on, which creates a real sense of jeopardy throughout each cycle, as you dive, weave, and (once you’ve unlocked the hook) grapple across contained areas. At full flow though, it hits the sweet spot of making you feel like you’re just about in control without ever feeling under-challenged.  However, there are frustrating issues that will have you moaning when you die. For one, the game never quite resolves the main problem with 3D bullet-hells, where you can be struck by a projectile that comes from off-screen. If that is a minor annoyance, then the design of arenas is more of an important one. The game’s environments, which are appealing enough to stave off any boredom from looking at them repeatedly, all have some degree of danger when it comes to bottomless drops. But on more than a few occasions, I found myself dashing back to avoid a wave of projectiles only to go tumbling because I couldn’t see the cliff behind me. I’ll happily admit that I’m not the most spatially aware at the best of times, but it does cheapen some of the otherwise excellent action.  Similarly, these issues are also compounded by the RNG baked into the game’s structure. Every time you die in Returnal, you lose your gun, and any of the Parasites (critters that latch on and grant you a buff and debuff) you’ve found. There are a few permanent upgrades, but on the whole, progress is by and large reset with death. While that’s not uncommon in a roguelike, it does mean that cycles can be heavily influenced by what randomly spawns in, especially when some items are infected with malignancy, which means you can take them, but you’ll get a suit malfunction that makes the game harder, such as your map getting scrambled or an increased dash cooldown. I struggled on my first few cycles, and then discovered a Parasite that gave me an auto-repair buff with damage from a long fall debuff. This is an extremely good perk with a quite soft caveat, and it meant I was able to get through the game’s first three worlds in one cycle by playing conservatively when I was on death’s door. While the balance can feel off on some runs, where you pick some handy attachments early on or limp on through without much to aid you, it doesn’t distract too much from that core combat loop.  Of course, Returnal isn’t all spraying and praying. Like Hades, it also wants to tell a complete story within the structure of a roguelike, and it’s this intriguing story that helps pull you through the more intense moments of frustration. Selene’s tale is told through Scout Logs you’ll find scattered throughout the worlds you explore, as well as first-person segments that put you inside her house (which has mystifyingly turned up on Atropos) and play like a simplistic P.T., all foreboding corridors and shifting environments. While trips into the house are very much Horror 101, a few misdirects followed by the occasional jump scare, they help create a sense of mystery that you want to unravel as you embark on each new cycle. While the overarching themes, which start in sci-fi before slowly evolving into something far grander, intrigue, Selene’s character suffers from this isolation. While Hades created a cast of hilarious, fully-formed characters who are a joy to learn from, Returnal puts Selene front and center, with only her own voice for company throughout the game. She is a cipher for the most part, someone who is deathly determined to carry out her mission with seemingly little agency of her own. While this makes sense for what the story wants to do - and we’re not expecting belly laughs from a game about trying to escape a living hell of blasting away aliens on a distant planet - it does mean the human elements of her predicament don’t land quite as forcefully as they could have done. 

I have to admit that, despite reaching the credits twice now, which comes with its own moment of partial resolution, there’s still plenty left for me to discover. The endgame has introduced new permanent items for me to hunt down, teasing further details and threads to tie off. While I’ve tried to keep details deliberately vague, Returnal touches on themes you might not expect from this sort of sci-fi setting and it’s a testament to what I’ve played so far that I’m keen to see how Housemarque brings them together. While Returnal is not a blockbuster at heart, it’s also Sony’s biggest PS5 exclusive since launch, and the game should satisfy anyone looking for an experience that gives their DualSense and headphones a workout. Rain feels like it’s coming through your controller with the pitter-patter effect of the DualSense, while a clever use of the triggers lets you aim by pulling the LT a little, and using a weapon’s alt-fire by bringing it in fully. Letting a volley of projectiles fly while your controller buzzes away is an endless simple pleasure. While 3D audio might be initially less noticeable, the little chittering of Parasites or booming drones in the distance all come together to sell the game’s alien environments more convincingly. But while Sony has been keen to emphasize these elements of the game, it perhaps does a disservice to Housemarque’s fine action and compelling story. Returnal is a breakaway from the type of exclusive Sony has focused on in recent years, using a genre that has only recently come back into fashion as a starting point for a story that makes you work to understand it, offering plenty to chew on without wrapping it up neatly. It’s an unexpectedly daring step forward for a developer who has refined what makes its style so compelling while adding in new elements. Returnal was reviewed on PS5 with code supplied by Sony.Hello, I'm GamesRadar's News Editor.

Returnal,Daniel Tack,Game Informer,https://www.gameinformer.com/review/returnal/returnal-review-haunting-harmony,"Returnal is a powerful roguelike recipe offering intense combat, a drip-fed narrative of palpable dread, and a cohesive combination of artistic elements. Housemarque’s third-person shooter delivers lightning-fast action transfused with incredible exploration, featuring equal doses of intensity and lingering unease. Every run is the start of something new, but what you learn over many failures provides an extra edge as you attempt to chart the sci-fi horror world of Atropos. Returnal deftly combines gameplay, graphics, and musical composition to create a haunting tapestry that’s an absolute joy to partake in, even when a mistimed dodge or a sinister trap claims your life.Returnal is a challenging game that puts relatively high demands on the player. There are no difficulty dials to tweak, so the experience can feel overbearing at times, especially in one of the later stages. While this adds to the overarching horror elements that exude from Returnal’s core and enhances the sweaty grip-for-your-life moment of slaying a massive boss, it’s important to note that it’s possible to lose hours of potential progress in mere seconds should things go awry. Death is inevitable and can be devastating. Being willing to learn and ready to adapt your strategies and glean takeaways for future runs is essential. I felt that the challenges presented by Returnal enhanced the nature of the unknown alien planet and that these elements contributed positively to the overall game. Still, some players may find these asks to be outside of their enjoyment range.As Selene, who gets stranded on an alien planet, your journey on Atropos brings questions and exciting revelations. The story is communicated slice-by-slice over time as you work through different biomes, with each narrative piece adding one element to a larger puzzle that’s a pleasure to work out. While anything but a blissful fairy tale, the narrative functions more like a soothing balm to the endless cycle of doomed runs and discomforting discoveries. When things were at their worst after a few failed runs, at least I was learning more about the mysteries that tie the world together. Try not to get spoiled by the story before playing the game, as it’s a pleasure to put together clue-by-clue.The exploration through the biomes is procedurally generated in some respects, but you learn to recognize rooms and what’s inside each one over time. This knowledge is power. Exploring carefully and mastering each space can lead to discovering hidden powerups tucked away in hard-to-find places, whether they are behind false walls or just out of sight on a precipice above. In addition to the temporary build that you craft each run, there are other permanent unlocks for your character to uncover. As you make progress, areas that you couldn’t previously access become available via tools like a grappling hook, hazard-protection boots, the ability to travel underwater, and more. Every time you find one of these new tools feels incredible as you can finally access areas that have taunted you with treasures for many, many runs. With each traversal find, you breathe a sigh of relief as a checkpoint is locked in.Applying learned knowledge to situations and scenarios carries over to combat, which is incredibly fast and rooted in the “bullet-hell” genre. Players must avoid various objects on the screen, each with its own pattern and directional movement. Learning each pattern on standard enemies is a constant battle as you progress, as new and deadlier abilities and patterns regularly appear. Boss battles take this to the next level, and you will find yourself relying on muscle memory and perhaps uttering a quick prayer while attempting to dodge growing rings, moving barriers, and hundreds of projectiles at varying speeds simultaneously. Throughout the game, you may be surprised at just what you can accomplish in this regard. Several times I said to myself, “No way,” as the game pushed another blitz of swirling projectiles onto my screen, but with well-timed dodges and jumps, I shocked even myself. Patterns that seemed challenging at first became laughable as I mastered the game's many systems, and it feels great to complete encounters with finesse.Avoiding things is half of the battle. The other half is shooting back. In Returnal, you unlock a variety of different weapons with various modes of fire and traits to unlock over time, which is sort of a permanent progression mechanic that improves your damage output from run to run. I became a huge fan of the rocket and grenade launcher archetypes and their various tweaks, which allowed me to pay more attention to getting out of the way while issuing my payloads. However, you never really know which weapon will be your best option during a run, so you have to become comfortable using a lot of them regardless. This keeps things fresh and had me stuck with one of my least favorite weapons during a particularly tough boss fight, but it’s all part of the freshness that comes with each run. You never know what you’re going to get, and you have to use everything together to survive. In true roguelike fashion, you may have runs with excellent weapons where you make a ton of progress across multiple biomes, and in others, you may perish a room or two into your adventure.Risk and reward are intricately tied together in Returnal, as there are numerous upgrades you can find that come with the risk of a malfunction that debuffs your character when you collect them. This means you might be able to increase your health pool or collect some bonus resources, but you might get a serious penalty as a price, like losing 85 percent of your damage while stationary. You can ditch these penalties by completing different goals, so careful planning for when to take on the risk of malfunctions is essential, as they can completely change the way you play. A late-game biome plays with the concept of issuing malfunctions for getting hit by some enemies, which, as you can imagine, is a massive incentive to up your dodge game. Learning how to manage malfunctions is a long process of weighing when and if to pick up specific bonuses, and it can make a huge difference on a run. Again, the theme of learning over time comes into play here, and I enjoyed tinkering with my risk profile on each run. Some runs, say when you are off to a bad start, the philosophy just becomes “well, I’m going to die anyway, why not roll the dice?” And sometimes, those dice roll in your favor.Returnal is a delightful immersion for the senses, even if the aspect it’s trying to convey is horrifying, lingering dread. It nails it in this regard, and is drenched with both in-your-face monstrosities and lurking terror. Enemy designs are hideous amalgamations of tentacles and teeth, which feel right at home in this bizarre alien hellscape. One of the late-game biomes is incredibly distressing to explore and may even significantly deter some players with thalassophobia.The soundtrack, primarily composed by Bobby Krlic (Midsommar), provides a haunting backdrop that contributes immensely to Returnal’s constant and rising sense of trepidation. The unnerving melodies gnaw at the back of your mind long after you set the controller down. One stage in particular hinges on music, and the feeling that you get while climbing up to the boss as it gets louder and louder exudes cacophonic anxiety. Feedback from the DualSense controller is a nice touch to the overall ensemble, providing nuance from the tiniest droplet of rain to the impact of a titanic monster crashing into you at high speed.Returnal is a relentless nightmare that’s a dream to play. The journey is full of horror and terrible discoveries, but also unbridled curiosity and wonder. If you have the taste for it, this is an adventure that begs to be experienced.

    Mike Epstein
   on February 15, 2023 at 8:00AM PSTPC version update: Returnal might have taken slightly longer than other PlayStation-exclusive titles to finally reach PC, but this engaging blend of fast-paced third-person action and roguelite progression could not feel more at home on its new platform. Aside from unlocking new levels of performance not possible on the PlayStation 5, Returnal arrives with some welcome new visual settings, an array of settings for display and upscaling options, and a bar-setting benchmark tool that helps you fine-tune performance far better than any other I've ever used.Returnal is a technical showpiece on the PS5, with remarkably rich art direction making each of the six distinct biomes a pleasure to explore. Its bright, neon particles and large, deadly projectiles flood environments and bathe them in a variety of colors, accentuating the exhilarating, fast-paced gunplay. On PC, it's action that's still best enjoyed with the controller it was ultimately designed for, the DualSense. If you use one with your PC setup, and you use it wired, you'll have full access to the same control scheme that was present on the PS5, including its marvelous use of the adaptive triggers to augment primary and secondary fire. It's just fine on any other controller, too, with appropriate button mapping making the gameplay feel just as natural. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the responsiveness of a mouse and keyboard feels transformative to Returnal, allowing me to zip around rooms and pull off deadly accurate shots with ease. Whichever way you choose to play, Returnal feels fantastic on PC.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Returnal Video ReviewReturnal's gameplay lives and dies on responsiveness, making anything below 60fps almost impossible to recommend. With that in mind, it's good that overall hardware utilization and the scalability of the four graphical presets allow for a wide range of hardware configurations to get the best out of the action. It was easy enough to attain performance in excess of 60fps playing on both my RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3050, with the latter handling the action just fine with most settings dialed up at 1080p.The additional capability of the RTX 3080 Ti can be used to power other settings such as ray-traced shadows and reflections, although the range of image-scaling options certainly helped in this regard. Nvidia's DLSS (without DLSS 3's frame-generation) and AMD's FSR are present as expected, but developers Housemarque and Climax Studio have also added Nvidia NIS (a linear image scaling technique similar to AMD's FSR that is platform agnostic), Adaptive and Linearly Scaled Resolutions options, and Variable Rate Shading (an option that reduces shading on unimportant parts of the current frame, reducing hardware demand). Having FSR and DLSS is somewhat expected of a good PC port today, but the addition of the rest is a welcome surprise that should give you plenty of avenues to try and hone in performance.Aiding in that endeavor is Returnal's best-in-class benchmark tool. Usually, these are nothing more than a way to see how a game might run at a specified settings preset, but Returnal's goes a step further by breaking down each aspect of the game that it's testing. From its particle system to thick volumetric fog, each scene bundles certain visual settings together and tests them specifically, allowing you to see exactly how your hardware is coping. The results screen at the end lets you scrub through each of these sections while also informing you which parts of your system are being tested in each one. This is invaluable in figuring out which settings to change to boost performance efficiently, and which likely won't make a difference, taking out a lot of guesswork typical of this process.Sadly, no matter how much time you spend tinkering with settings, Returnal is currently a bit too much for the Steam Deck to handle. I attempted to run the game on its lowest graphical preset, at a resolution slightly lower than native, and with FSR set to Performance (thus rendering the game at 50% of its resolution), and it was impossible to maintain a stable 30fps, nevermind anything close to double that. This was in some of the least-demanding early sections of the game, meaning the later chaotic ones would likely fare even worse. Returnal hasn't been officially certified for Steam Deck yet, so there's the possibility this could change, but it could be just too much for the portable device to ever handle.There is one facet of Returnal's gameplay that its robust benchmark misses, however. Loading between each new procedurally-generated room that you enter routinely caused a large stutter, irrespective of which settings I was using. It was generally abrupt enough to plummet my framerate down from the mid-90s to somewhere in the 30s for a second, which was more than enough to make it distracting. Given the speed at which you're making your way through Returnal's biomes, having this happen consistently was incredibly distracting, and not something I would've expected given the game was installed on an incredibly fast Samsung 980 Pro SSD.Although the performance on Steam Deck is disappointing and the consistent hitches are an annoyance, Returnal is another great port of a previous PlayStation 5 exclusive. It opens up the intoxicating gameplay loop to a new audience while offering all the bells and whistles expected of a modern PC port, with the addition of a remarkably robust benchmark tool and an impressive amount of graphical and rendering settings to fine-tune performance. Returnal has long been one of the best PS5 games, and now it could stand as one of the best on PC, too. -- Alessandro BarbosaYou can read our original review of the PS5 version, published on April 29, 2021, below.Returnal is a hard game to pin down. On the one hand, it is very much a pastiche of existing game genres: Play one run and you will see how it very clearly draws elements from roguelikes, Souls-likes, metroidvanias, action-platformers, bullet hell shooters, and horror games. But while it borrows from all those genres, its unique flow ensures that its chaotic shooting galleries and creepy storytelling feel decidedly new. A shifting, but not jarring pace, an unpredictable narrative, tough-as-nails gameplay, and a constant sense of ambient terror--Returnal's many moving parts coalesce into a rare shooter that grabs you with its mechanics and its story and never lets go, seducing you with its challenges and a foreboding sense of dread every step of the way.When you start Returnal, interstellar scout Selene Vassos crash-lands on an alien planet, Atropos, which is broadcasting a mysterious signal. Stranded, Selene makes some startling discoveries on the planet, including the game's titular trait: When she dies, Selene ""returns"" to the site of the crash, seemingly unharmed. To explain much more would give away too much: You want to know as little about Returnal and its story as you can going in.Yes, ""return"" is in the name, which is a not-subtle-not to Returnal’s run-based structure. It falls into the broader definition of a roguelite--Selene starts each run from the crash site but holds a few key upgrades and one of two in-game currencies from run to run. Everything else, including her weapon, ""artifacts"" that provide passive upgrades, and consumables like healing items disappear with each death. Selene wanders through the procedurally arranged and populated landscapes of Atropos hoarding gear, upgrading her health and weapon level (called proficiency), and gunning down the planet's strange-looking, tentacle-wiggling creatures, all of which want you dead.Though some swipe at you with teeth, claws, and the aforementioned tentacles, most of your enemies have the ability to shoot some kind of bright, colorful projectiles at you. In a large combat arena, the room very quickly fills with a gauntlet of neon orbs and beams of light for you to sidestep, jump over, and dash through. Each enemy species has its own bullet type with a predictable pattern to learn, but when you put four or more together, even the simple enemies can create complex, beautiful light shows that will put you down if you aren't at the top of your game. Unlike most ""bullet hell"" shooters, where you're looking down from overhead, Returnal puts projectiles in your face and makes you react quickly and gracefully. That can be a challenge: Sometimes the number of bright beams and orbs on screen gets so unwieldy, it feels impossible to keep up. The only way to make things more manageable is to kill your enemies, so you're constantly planning your offense and defense--looking for a route to safety, while also taking aim and whittling down the opposition.Returnal’s combat mechanics reward players who can perfectly dodge enemy attacks while keeping their composure. With every kill, Selene builds up adrenaline, which provides temporary bonuses, like a more powerful melee attack and a glowing aura that makes enemies easier to see, so long as you don’t take damage. There’s also an active reload mechanic, which helps you dish out as much bullet hell as you take. Given the ridiculous number of bullets you have to avoid at any given time, it can be tough to work in a quick reload between dodges. In fact, it pays to know when to skip a reload, rather than risk delaying your next attack. More importantly, it’s an easy and very tangible way to see your skills improve run to run.Selene can find a small but nicely varied array of guns for herself, as well as artifacts, which offer passive upgrades. Her arsenal ranges from classic pistols and assault rifles to the Electropylon Driver, which fires posts that generate laser beams between them, allowing you to trap an enemy in a deadly laser grid. Each weapon type also comes with randomly assigned perks, which you unlock by killing enemies and which persist across runs. As your weapon level grows, the weapons you find have better stats, along with more and better perks. And you always have a sword, which lets you disable enemy shields and can quickly dispatch enemies who get in close. When you have a strong understanding of your tools, you can find a rhythm for working any combat scenario that’s specific to your build.Not every upgrade is entirely a blessing. Many of the items and chests you'll find will be ""malignant,"" so picking up or opening them will incur a temporary penalty until you complete an objective. For example, you may do half as much damage with your sword until you use two consumable items, like a temporary shield or a healing item. You'll also find parasites, which impose both an upgrade and a debuff, and can't be switched out without a special item or device found in the world. While you can simply avoid any items with potential negative impact, it's hard to build up power without them, so the quest to make a winning build often forces you to make some smart compromises and, occasionally, roll the dice to increase your prowess.This wide range of weapons and gear is both a blessing and a curse: On the one hand, you'll never have to run the same strategy twice. On the other, your success is largely contingent on finding the right stuff. This is true in most roguelites to some degree, but it's especially prevalent here: When I had the right gear, I was unstoppable. When I didn't, I struggled to make even incremental progress.You also have to flex your beam-dodging skills with a fair amount of complex platforming. Many rooms will tempt you with items guarded by laser grids or long trails of small platforms. Returnal's controls are tight and responsive, so you have the tools you need to navigate even when the timing is extremely tight, assuming you have the precision and reflexes to master them. (And Reader: I didn't always have them). Having traps, obstacles, and hidden rooms to find in every run means the act of exploring never feels wasteful or boring. You're always desperate for more health or that next upgrade, and even when you come to know the shape of every pre-fab room, there's always a sense that you don't know what might be around the next corner.Though Returnal's basic mechanics fall within the broad specifications of a roguelite, it features more ways to make permanent progress than your average run-based game. Though they change with every life, each zone follows a loose basic structure with a main path and branching side paths. On your first time through each zone, you'll come across a barrier on the main path that you can't breach, either because you need a key or a movement ability you don't have, like a grappling hook or an item that lets you explore underwater. This will lead you down a secondary main path that, once completed, you will not need to repeat on future runs. The result is a shifting and changing micro-run: To reach the next objective, you'll need to play through the next 2-4 hours of the game without dying to advance the story, but you won't need to complete every step on a winning run.It creates a balance between the endurance-based challenge of the traditional roguelite, where you not only need to succeed, but to do so well enough that you can continue on, and the extreme challenge put forth by the bullet hell-style shooting galleries you have to conquer. It also opens the door for Returnal's many challenging boss fights which, in typical Souls-like fashion, asks you to fight giant, daunting enemies that can literally fill the screen with waves of attacks that are as beautiful as they are deadly. No matter the challenge, progress always feels attainable, removing some of the sting from the repetitive, unforgiving nature of the run-based structure.Moreover, on a narrative level, mixing up your objectives helps create a sort of fog around your goals. You always know the way forward, but what you're actually doing changes over time. Between the shifting maps and the ever-changing objectives, you’re never quite sure where you’re headed, which feels nerve-wracking. That doesn’t necessarily mean you’re lost--the way forward is almost always clear--but your lack of awareness fosters a general sense of confusion that amplifies this undercurrent of discomfort that washes over you while exploring Atropos.I wouldn't describe Returnal as a horror game, exactly, but it is consistently spooky and occasionally terrifying. You don't get much about Selene, the planet, or why she's there early on, but the mystery is constantly at the forefront of your mind. You receive a drip-feed of information from run to run through audio logs, monologues, and cutscenes, which you find by exploring the different rooms that pop up as you make it closer and closer to your goal. Scouring each area many, many times is crucial to getting the full story, as new notes appear as you make it further in the world and uncover other secrets.Returnal uses that lack of information aggressively, frequently showing you images and referencing events for which you have no context, all in service of creating a slippery understanding of Selene, a nightmarish impression of Atropos, and a mystique around the true nature of your mission. From its first moments, it's clear that something is very wrong, but you have no idea what it is or how it might manifest next. The need to know what's going on never leaves your thoughts, even as it instills a strong sense of ominous dread.The ""horror"" of Returnal is largely sequestered to the narrative of the game, but there are a handful of playable story sequences where it comes through front and center. From time to time, Selene will find an area with her home from Earth, a literal American house, just sitting in the middle of the wilderness. When the time is right and she enters the house, you're put into a short, first-person sequence that focuses on narrative and mood. You have no guns, no real control over what to do, and you're subjected to some spooky events that teach you more about the world, while sending shivers down your spine.Returnal uses the tech of the PS5 to give you tons of sensory feedback that connects you to the world and amplifies your general state of confusion and fear. When playing with headphones on--and I strongly urge you to do so--you can hear the sounds of creatures rustling through the underbrush and howling in the distance all around you, giving you the sense that you could be attacked at any time. In the heat of combat, using surround sound gives you the chance to keep track of enemies and their attacks by ear. Using the DualSense'’s haptics, you can feel the rain hitting Selene'’s space suit and other environmental effects. Certain weapons perks will also add resistance to the triggers to change how the gun fires, which helps create a tactile connection to the game. (Though, it can be annoying to suddenly find you need to press the trigger twice as hard to fire your gun.)Returnal is constantly unsettling and consistently challenging. Its mysterious story and demanding action feel intense, urgent, and fresh. The fast-moving combat manages to appear incredibly daunting, bordering on overwhelming, without ever actually becoming insurmountable. Every moment is a rush, either because you just barely evaded a giant purple laser or because you have no idea why there's an Apollo-era astronaut following your every move. Do you need to be a little brave to play Returnal? Yeah. Do you need to be glutton for punishment? It helps. They say that anything worth doing should scare you at least a little bit. I'm not sure if that's always true, but Returnal makes a strong case.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"
Returnal,Diego Arguello,Polygon,https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22408761/returnal-review-ps5-housemarque,"Filed under:Housemarque’s PS5 exclusive elevates the time loop genreI was losing faith in Returnal until I encountered the second boss.After a few dozen runs, the enchanting presentation and sense of discovery from my first few hours had started to wear off. I felt weak compared to the colossal creatures that defended their territory against an unwanted visitor. I had seen and used all weapons available at the time, slowly unlocking new alt-fires and passive skills for them, but none had managed to impress me enough. The first boss had only taken me a couple of tries to conquer, yet I could barely make any progress in the second area. I was running in circles.I stopped playing and came back the next day. After some painful runs, I finally managed to move through the enemies’ lines, dodging lasers in midair and never ceasing fire. I climbed all the way up a mountain, facing wave after wave of foes and traps as I made my way through. But all of a sudden, the chaos stopped. Up there in the summit, a dormant creature waited for me to step into the arena.Polygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences.

I used all of the movement options at my disposal, carefully planning their execution. The music, which had been almost as quiet as the enemy before my arrival, quickly ramped up. All the while, the boss showcased its plethora of attacks, perhaps as a warning of what was to come. In one moment, a storm of projectiles would follow my toes. In another, the creature would fly quickly through the arena. During the battle’s final phase, the enemy started attacking in close quarters in a much weaker stance, rampaging against the floor, producing shock waves with each hit, using whatever strength it had left.Seeing the boss struggling to stand on its feet as it tried to defeat me one more time symbolized what Returnal is about: It’s a showcase of the toll that comes from repetition.This PlayStation 5 exclusive introduces itself as a third-person roguelike with set levels that reorient themselves in each run, across a total of six areas. Traversing through them means facing increasingly harder enemies, collecting weapons and items as you explore an array of rooms per area. You do so through the eyes of Selene, a space pilot stuck in a time loop on a hostile alien planet, attempting to solve the mystery of how to escape. Roguelikes have stopped being a niche genre; all the while, more games are iterating on loop-based structures to tell stories. This game is a take on the genre that intertwines horror with almost every aspect of itself. Returnal’s bosses take the bullet-hell chaos that developer Housemarque is known for and subvert it by putting the player’s perspective front and center. Orbs that would usually just plague the screen as small circles (when viewed from above) now come toward you. Melee attacks are much more terrifying when the creature unleashing them is three times taller than you and covered in tentacles. Returnal is tough. Even when you get to the point of having learned all the ins and outs of a biome, you’ll find yourself in a new one with different enemy arenas and rooms to plunge through. And it all starts again. Each biome has its own set-pieces that alternate with every run, altering enemy placements and shifting the pool of items you can find or purchase. Aside from permanent spacesuit upgrades, which correspond to specific objects and areas in the game, and the passive skills you’ve unlocked for your weapons, not much more is retained after a time loop. More often than not, I found myself with my hands gripped to the triggers, doing my best to ignore the fact that I was facing uneven odds.Selene can only carry one weapon at a time. Each one has different passive skills that are unlocked purely by using the weapon, as well as an alternate fire that can be activated by pulling the DualSense’s left trigger all the way down, instead of depressing it halfway to aim — a feature I loved.

  As for movement options, Selene can only jump once, and her dash is somewhat limited. While it allows you to dodge through almost all projectiles (as long as they’re not purple), it has a hefty cooldown. In a game where split-second decisions can save you from a killing blow, the short wait until the dash becomes available again can feel eternal. It takes some time to get used to this, especially since the enemies aren’t exactly patient about it.Item descriptions in roguelikes tend to consist merely of quick, catchy blurbs that are mysterious as they are unhelpful. Unfortunately, Returnal upholds that trope. It’s rather annoying to see “this affects your dash” reflected in a more colorful animation and not much else. Throwing yourself off a cliff or dashing toward an enemy attack on purpose aren’t really good ways to test out an item, either, since you always have to be aware of your health.

  Then there are parasites, which grant a buff and a debuff, both of which are explained before you pick them up. It’s an excellent idea on paper, but it quickly became more of a nuisance, as the drawbacks would often outweigh the benefits. These debuffs are also present in some items and chests, but unlike with the parasites, you have no idea what to expect there. Sometimes I got lucky, but in most cases I would get a debuff that significantly affected my run. I would always have the option to break free of it by completing a specific challenge, but there weren’t many times that I was able to do that before dying.Toward the end of the game, I started to avoid parasites and items with possible debuffs altogether. I could rarely find reasons to risk my run in the mere hopes of getting an item or a cool buff. Some consumable items do help to mitigate harmful status effects, such as one that detaches parasites and another that eliminates all debuffs. The latter, for example, pushed me to go on a chest-opening spree before the next fight, and then I just used the item to undo my debuffs ahead of the battle. This dynamic was refreshing. I just wish items like this weren’t so few and far between.I had to be smart about the risks I was willing to take in each run, and Selene’s demeanor often matched how I was feeling. She faces uneven odds from the moment she sets foot on the planet, and that is clear in every encounter. It makes every victory significant, and revisiting past areas after learning the ropes feels immensely rewarding. But I was particularly impressed by the way Returnal portrays Selene’s exhaustion, which gets elevated by the planet’s cyclical nature.Every time Selene is defeated, she’s taken back to the initial landing spot, a crash site where her ship lies broken into pieces. But before she’s able to try again, a sequence of cutscenes appears on screen. They replay the crash and Selene’s arrival on this planet, but also display new events that begin to happen as the story unravels, making the flashback more poignant and terrifying with each death. These cutscenes tend to repeat themselves, but whenever I thought I knew what to expect, a new vision would shake me to the core, leaving me with even more questions about Selene’s life before the crash.Desperation and uncertainty are ever-present feelings in each run of Returnal. They are there whenever Selene picks up a recording from the ground only to hear her own voice, relating events and thoughts that we as the player haven’t seen yet. Perhaps even more terrifying are the moments when Selene finds her own body, time and time again, in different places. This loses some impact at the cost of adding a fun but gimmicky online component where you can find other players’ corpses and trigger an optional fight if you choose to avenge them. Despite that, seeing Selene’s body across some key locations after a couple of runs, often sitting in stillness, as if it had been shut down, becomes a scary constant.After defeating a few bosses, Selene finds a house that further toys around with these ideas. It did feel a bit reminiscent of P.T., but the visits were usually short enough and different enough from one another that I never tired of visiting the house. I won’t spoil any of its surprises, so instead I’ll say that it always left me with a wide range of emotions. Fear was the foundation, but there were story twists and even new momentary mechanics introduced there that took me by surprise and left me smiling at the screen, lost in a mix of confusion and admiration.Returnal’s biggest achievement is the way it presents the horror of being stuck in place. It’s bold and unapologetic in crafting its universe, making up for some of its more frustrating decisions by carving its own path and fulfilling its haunting potential. It doesn’t matter how hard Selene fights; she’s back in the same place with the same questions as before, if not more. The terror of fighting tooth and nail, seeing her suit covered in snow, mud, and sand, her visions tormenting her in her sleep — it stuck with me.After the 26 hours that it took me to see the final credits, I could relate to Selene’s exhaustion. But by the time I was at the final boss, dodging hundreds of projectiles at once and side-eyeing my health bar, I felt consumed. I beat it with only one hit left on me, and I stood there watching the screen as I slowly regained my breath. All the while, Selene was in critical condition, as illustrated by a black-and-white filter, a flashing red signal on her suit, and a slow walk that reflected her injuries. I watched the final cutscene, waiting for a big revelation that would tie everything together, but the discovery was only one more piece of the puzzle. And I got sent back to the crash site, as ever.Even after more than 60 runs of Returnal, the enchanting presentation and sense of discovery still remain. I now feel vigorous compared to the creatures that have tried to defend their territory against an unwanted visitor. The last boss only took me one try to beat it, yet I could barely make any progress in finding the right answers. I feel like I’m running in circles. But I’m not giving up.

Returnal,John Walker,Kotaku,https://kotaku.com/returnal-pc-settings-graphics-sony-ps5-port-exclusive-1850117638,"Returnal is an incredibly good game, and I am incredibly bad at Returnal. What makes it such a joy, whether in its original form on PlayStation or in this new PC version, is that being bad at it barely dents at its incredible appeal and overwhelming replayability.For those arriving afresh to 2021’s PS5 title, this is Sony-owned Housemarque’s exquisite combination of big-budget third-person shooter, with the sensibilities of an indie roguelite. Which is to say, every time you die at the hands of the writhing alien horrors, you start right back at the crash site of your spaceship, your progress lost, but for the permanent upgrades and improvements you’ve perhaps made in previous runs.Selene Vassos is a space pilot whose ship crashes on Atropos, after she goes rogue in her pursuit of something called the White Shadow signal. But on her very first venture out into the overgrown ruins of the area, she discovers…her own dead body. There are recordings she’s previously created and left for herself to hear, seemingly aware that at certain points she loses her memory. Then on your first time dying at the hands tentacles of a local monster, you find yourself reliving the crash before awakening back on your ship. It’s a time loop, and one where the planet you’re on reshapes itself each time you set out.And set out again you will, the game’s difficulty set deliberately high, such that in your earliest runs you’re close to helpless, given your lack of a melee weapon, the potato gun you begin with, and the way the doors keep locking behind you, sealing you in enormous arenas with a vast, red lion-octopus thing that pins you down as it tears you into chunks. And yet you keep going. And going. And going, getting slightly better at the game, while being rewarded with slightly better starting equipment. Perhaps a bonus item that heals you, or something to skewer enemies with spikes, or it could be entirely new traversal equipment.$70 off these best-in-class wireless headphonesGizmodo reviewed them and declared them to be “annoyingly incredible.""What’s so important about all of this—even if you’re someone (like me) averse to the whole Dark Souls scourge on gaming, and who would rather belly-flop onto railings than do yet another boss fight—is that it’s so outrageously compelling. Both in 2021, and today, this is a game that always feels eminently fair, where every failure is entirely on you, and yet constantly gives you the feeling that next time, next time you’ll get it. You don’t. In fact, you do far worse than last time. But you laugh it off, and head out yet again, because goddammit, it’s just so much fun to play.OK, so obviously if you’re familiar with the game, what you want to know most of all right now is how does it hold up on PC? The joyful answer is: tremendously. This is unquestionably a very demanding game, and I feared that I would need to reduce my computer’s setup to be more in line with the far lower television resolutions and scales a console demands, but none of that was true.My PC is pretty decent, although ever-more modest: AMD Ryzen 5 5600X, 32GB RAM, with a GeForce RTX 3070. It’s usually able to run most games close to full specs, albeit with the fancier bells and whistles toned down. Returnal informed me it wanted to run things at “Epic,” about which I was somewhat dubious, before realizing it was intending to do this at 3440x1440. Ha, yeah, sure. And then it did. And for the most part, it’s delivered that at a pretty solid 55-60FPS. Which has blown me away—aren’t these console ports supposed to chug along at 25FPS on minimum settings until at least the third patch?I say for the most part, because I have had a couple of moments of slowdown, extremely busy scenes where framerates have noticeably dropped, or where the GPU usage has spiked so high my whole PC starts to groan. But these have been rare, and let’s not forget I’m running the whole thing at full specs, in ultra-widescreen. (It even offers support for 32:9 Super Ultrawide, should you have a monitor that mad.) Of course, that’s my PC, and I don’t have the facilities to do wider testing—your mileage may vary, and with any PC release, there are hardware combinations that meet issues.If you want to get hardcore with your hardware, Returnal PC offers a wealth of toggles, including NVidia’s DLSS and NIS, and AMD’s FSR, to boost framerates, along with options for ray-traced shadows and reflections, if you really like it when your GPU starts to wheeze. Beyond this, you can tweak every detail of lighting, environmental details, and post-processing options, with the option to have FPS, CPU, GPU, temperatures and RAM use all live on screen while you’re perfecting your setup. It really is a master class in how to deliver a top-end game to PC users, somewhat ironically coming from a console company.Oh, and if you want to get the full experience, you can hook up a PS5 DualSense controller to your PC, and get all the same haptic feedback and trigger witchcraft that comes with the console version. Personally, I opted to play mouse/keyboard, having already spent a ludicrous number of hours playing the PS5 version, and really appreciated the far greater aiming precision of God’s own gaming setup. With dash on Shift and melee on middle mouse, there wasn’t really anything to miss but for the haptic sensation of rain falling all around me.This PC port also offers co-op play, and the endless challenge mode of the Tower of Sisyphus, so it’s pretty much identical to the PS5’s version, just at resolutions that’ll make your console chums cry into their controllers.I’m really pleased to have returned to Returnal, even if it has been a lesson in just how awful I am at the game. It’s just so much fun to play, even when you’re failing, and that’s a rare and precious thing—something too often forgotten in gaming since the days of the arcade. Goodness me, if I had to stick in another quarter every time I lost, I’d be flat-broke by now, and happy about it.Returnal drip-feeds you progress just often enough to leave you feeling like progress is always achievable, but at a pace slow enough that you do something more important: get better at it through practice. Enemies that felt impossibly deadly at the start become brushed aside not because you’ve now got a vast arsenal of weapons and seventy times more health—you just don’t—but because you got good at beating them. That’s a tremendously satisfying experience.In fact, the whole game is a tremendously satisfying experience. From the wonderful alien design, to the slow-burning storyline and its blank-faced staring astronaut, to the satisfying array of weapons, and perhaps most importantly, to the way the statues crumble when you hit them, this is something utterly solid, and eternally compelling. And unless my rig proves a fluke, finally a console-to-PC port to celebrate on day one."
Returnal,Ari Notis,Kotaku,https://kotaku.com/returnal-the-kotaku-review-1846786237,"I’m sure you’ve felt it too. For the past year and some change, life has fallen into a rut more than usual. Life is always cyclical to some degree—humans are, after all, creatures of habit—but the stresses that go hand-in-hand with a certain mismanaged pandemic have made the day-to-day feel more dreary and cyclical than ever. Returnal, an action game out tomorrow for PlayStation 5, captures that sensation in a bottle.To play Returnal is to subject yourself to repeated lessons in failure. Every time you play, you’ll do the same thing, except slightly different, except the same, really. You might, at the end of a session, walk away with the inexorable, all-consuming notion that everything is futile, that nothing will ultimately change, and that it’s just not worth it, man.Good thing the game is such a blast.Let’s start with the basics: Returnal is a sci-fi action game with a heavy focus on shooting and laser-precise traversal. Developed by Housemarque—a Finnish studio best known for slick bullet-hell shooters of the side-scrolling (Resogun) or top-down (Nex Machina) variety—Returnal notably features a third-person perspective viewed over the shoulder. At any given moment, enemies swarm your position, filling the screen with a barrage of iridescent orbs. You can only survive a handful of hits, so you have to dodge this sea of neon by jumping or dashing. (Later on, you can use a grappling hook to zip across levels and out of danger.) You fight back with an arsenal of standard-issue video game weapons: pistols, shotguns, rifles, launchers, and one seriously kickass alien sword.You play Selene Vassos, an interstellar scout working for a space agency called Astra. Returnal opens with Selene approaching Atropos, an uncharted planet. Atropos looms large and ominous, its pearl-white weather systems swirling over a planet too massive to fit entirely in view. In short order, a storm disables her spaceship, the Helios, sending it careening through the cloud cover, where it crash-lands in a damp Atropian forest.Selene finds her sidearm on a deceased Astra scout and quickly notices that the corpse shares her callsign and spacesuit. Huh. Moving on. Astra protocol dictates that Selene can only be rescued if she reaches a far-off radio signal, so her one and only priority is figuring out how to get there.On your journey you’ll jump and dash and shoot your way through various biomes—including that waterlogged forest, an arid desert, and a decrepit, long-abandoned metropolis set amid an orange-hued wasteland that looks like something out of Blade Runner 2049—littered with the shattered remnants of an apparently dead civilization referred to only as “the sentients.” The placement and order of these biomes remains the same each game, but each one’s layout, loot, and enemy contingents are procedurally generated. As in other live-die-repeat games, no two runs will be quite the same.Whenever you die—and don’t for a second assume that you won’t die a whole, whole lot—you’re zipped back to the beginning. Death is always a bit disorienting. In rare instances, you’ll wake up in the cockpit of the Helios, one of the few moments when the game switches to a first-person perspective. More often, you wake up in the dirt. Returnal doesn’t have a start screen or menu. Whether you’re booting up the game or respawning from your latest death, a smash-cut version of the opening cinematic plays out.Yes, Returnal is yet another time-loop game. The past few years of fiction have featured so many recursively structured stories that I sometimes feel like I’m in a time loop of time loops, but Returnal tees up a novel approach. Often, the time-loop story kicks off at the start of the cycle, but Returnal throws you into the thick of it. I, as Selene, may have died nearly 70 times so far. It’s impossible to calculate how many times she died before I entered the picture and became singularly responsible for her life and wellbeing.So that’s the thought exercise at the core of Returnal: What do you do when you realize you’re not just stuck in a time loop but have possibly been stuck in it for an indeterminable length of time? And, in the face of that realization, how do you motivate yourself to keep going?“I’ll make it this time,” Selene says after standing up for what feels like the millionth time. I don’t believe her at all, mostly because I don’t believe in myself.Returnal is, without question, the most challenging game I’ve played in a long time. The enemies are relentless, and you’re quite fragile.Enemies in Returnal don’t retreat or cower behind cover. They’re constantly pushing your position, raining—torrentially downpouring, more like—projectiles your way. Some foes create laser-beam rings that ripple outward. Others can summon tendrils to snag your feet, slowing your movement. There are also turrets everywhere, many of which have shields you can only break with a melee attack. Trying to keep track of this all while also shooting enemies is a lot to juggle. Returnal forces you to learn how its patterns work, to respawn and try again, armed with knowledge gained through the fire of trial and error.But also, absolutely fuck some of these fucking enemies into the fucking sun. I’d like to call out the bats specifically. (They’re technically called Lamiadons, but, look, “bats” rolls off the tongue better.) Returnal never feels cheap, mostly because Selene’s movement is more finely tuned than a baby grand under the purview of the New York Philharmonic. But the bats have really tested my patience. Survival in Returnal is largely contingent on dodging projectiles. Bats, instead, full-body barrel into you, seemingly without warning, completely flipping the script you’re handed at the start. As I eloquently put it in a Kotaku Slack channel, “THE BATS ARE THE WORST.”Returnal gives you a snappy toolkit to take on enemies. When you dash, you’re fully invulnerable, so instead of moving as far and as fast as possible away from projectiles, it’s often more beneficial to dodge toward—and even through—them. You’re invincible (momentarily)! You can take it, so long as your timing is sound.The game also features a unique approach to alternate-fire modes. Every weapon features a secondary fire, a cooldown-tied ability that can vary from a proximity mine to a single-use grenade to a Palpatine-esque stream of lightning. In the default control scheme you don’t activate this with a button. Instead, while aiming down the sights, you’ll feel the left trigger tense up, a haptic innovation you’d only find in the PS5’s controller. Pushing past that tension activates the secondary fire, at which point you’d then need to pull the right trigger to fire. (You can switch this to a more traditional scheme in the game’s settings.)Less of a trip, at least for those who’ve played Gears of War, is the reloading mechanic. You don’t have any ammo reserves. Weapon clips on Atropos automatically recharge, but if you empty a clip, you need to time a reloading mini-game. Your clip—which is displayed directly under your reticule, so you can’t miss it—will turn into a rightward-moving slider; stop it at the right spot, and you’ll instantly reload. (The target stopping point varies in width at an apparently random basis.) Time it wrong, and your gun will jam for a second. It’s yet one more element to keep track of amid the onslaught, constantly keeping you on your toes. Upon death, yes, Returnal always sends you back to the beginning of the loop. As with all roguelikes and roguelike-likes, dying is so, so frustrating. I mean, you found so many health upgrades! And, man, you had the best gun! Really, how could you possibly lose when you lucked into that rare revival item? Uggghhh.Not all is lost. Returnal features a handful of permanent upgrades that carry between runs. Whenever you unlock a new weapon—typically at or near the start of each unlocked biome—that weapon stands a chance of spawning in your next run. Same rules apply to consumable items and artifacts (accessories that grant you a bonus for the duration of that life). Still, you start every run fresh, with nothing more than a pistol and your reserves of a single type of currency that, in the game’s mythos, transcends timelines.Returnal features classic roguelike elements like “How’s this for a twist on Groundhog Day?” and “Nice loadout you’ve got there, it’d be a shame if something…happened to it.” But it also makes some more unusual choices. For one thing, you only have to defeat each boss once. So, for instance, after your first kill of Phrike (the first biome’s boss), on every future run you can skip that fight and head directly to the Crimson Wastes, provided you survive the first biome’s arboreal trek. But boss fights tend to give you some sweet upgrades. So do you take on the boss—who’s more likely to kill you compared to the cannon fodder—for the chance of nabbing some powerful gear? Or do you play things safe and skip the fight?You also don’t have to trek through every biome each run. Once you defeat Ixion, the boss of the Crimson Wastes, you’ll earn a permanent upgrade that allows you to directly access the third biome, the Derelict Citadel. This poses a similar quandary. You could take the time to fight through both the first and second biomes, picking up silphium resin (health upgrades) and parasites (double-edged equippable bonuses) along the way, all in the effort to prepare yourself as best as possible for the punishing third biome. Or you could skip the Crimson Wastes altogether and beeline to the Derelict Citadel.A brief detour into some mid-game story spoilers:Spoilers follow for the doozy of a mid-game twist in Returnal. Then there’s the big twist. Partway through the game, you “win.” You find the radio signal. You defeat an enormous Atropian sentient named Nemesis, which is just such a final boss name. Astra pinpoints your location and not only mounts a rescue mission but, against all odds (see: massive scary hostile planet), pulls it off. You accomplish your stated goal. Everything wraps up so neatly that you can’t help but feel you’ve finished the game, or, at the very least, have hit the endgame.Ha, ha. Good one!Selene does indeed escape Atropos, and does indeed live out the rest of her days on Earth, in apparent bliss and relative quiet. Then she dies. You even witness her burial in an eerie, first-person cutscene…...and then, seconds later, Selene wakes up the way she always does: on the damp forest floor of Atropos. The planet itself seems altered—some time has passed, and that waterlogged forest has since become an overgrown swamp—but it’s crystal clear: She’s back in the same loop, which means you are too. Dammit.There are six biomes in Returnal. As far as I’ve seen, once you broach this halfway point, every death returns you to the start of the fourth biome, which bears a stark resemblance to the first but is still very much its own deal. In other words, in any given run, you only have to make your way through three biomes (or two, if you, like me, are equal parts impatient and cautious). As far as twists go, it blew my mind—in terms of both narrative and structure. It’s also the one thing I would’ve loved a heads up about before diving into the game. Were I not playing this for review, I can’t say for sure I would’ve powered through; the sheer thought of making it through six lengthy biomes in one run sounded impossible. Three? Well, that’s easier to swallow.Spoilers over. Carry on.“I could do this all day.” – Ari Notis, staff writer who in fact cannot do this all day, Kotaku.comEdge of Tomorrow simulatorTight movement, snappy shooting, stupidly gorgeous environments and particle effects, exhilarating boss fights.Myself, my failures, the fact that you can’t save and quit (c’mon, it’s 2021), the bats, holy fuck, the bats. Also the dialogue veers into melodrama.HousemarquePS5April 30, 2021Over the course of 33 hours and 20 minutes, explored 214 areas in five biomes, died 69 times (nice), killed 3,768 hostile monsters, performed 308 overloads, suffered 55 suit malfunctions, attached 37 parasites to my nervous system, and experienced one existential crisis.As mentioned, Returnal is one of the more challenging games I’ve played in recent times; as I write this, I’m still hacking away at the fifth biome, whose mini-boss keeps stealing my lunch money and wedgieing me to death. It’s also one of the most well-crafted. I’m still trying to unlock some obvious, Metroid-style upgrades, like the ability to swim in pools of water I’ve passed. I haven’t seen how vestigial story threads play out. And yet, I feel fully confident in saying that Returnal is well worth checking out.Of the many things Returnal does right, few top the boss fights, each of which is both a puzzle and a challenge. Broken into three progressively intense waves, you have to dodge literally hundreds of projectiles while trying to line up shots on the boss, usually centrally located in the arena. You might master the first two waves, and still get eviscerated by the third. Back to the drawing board, and the start of the game.Weaponry in Returnal is totally randomized. There are 10 weapons types and 10 secondary fire modes that can slot onto any weapon. Defeating a boss is partially contingent on memorizing patterns, but it’s also a matter of luck: While working through biomes, will you get one of the weapon pairings fit for that particular boss fight? Or will you be stuck with a dinky pistol?While bashing my head against the fourth biome’s boss, I repeatedly never found anything better than a dinky pistol. I learned the patterns, but I couldn’t deal enough damage to make a difference. Every time I tried, I’d make it to the third wave and die within seconds, focusing too much on landing my weak shots rather than effectively dodging the volleyball-sized orbs of space goo. Then I got lucky and found a weapon called the hollowseeker, which doesn’t deal much damage per individual bullet but does have a blistering fire rate and a nearly bottomless clip. Equip the hollowseeker, hold down the right trigger, and you can brainlessly dish out constant damage while focusing on dodging the boss’s projectiles. “Man,” I thought, “this is gonna be a breeze!”I hadn’t realized it, but I’d been holding my breath for the entirety of the third round.After you defeat bosses, you’ll unlock Returnal’s weirdest segments, in which the game veers directly into psychological horror. Throughout the first biome, you’ll come across a mid-century house. Usually, you can’t interact with it at all, but after beating a boss, you’ll see the porch light flicker during the following run, at which point you can walk right in. The game pivots from third- to first-person and the pace slows to a crawl without releasing any tension. You can’t sprint or shoot. You can only pick up and put down various mundane objects—pill bottles, laptops, cereal boxes, rejection letters.It’s not worth spoiling what happens in these sections, as they’re brief, rare, and consistently astonishing. I’ll just say this: Before the game came out, a series of screenshots and concept art pieces suggested that nothing in Returnal would be more nightmare-inducing than the local creatures. Every monster in this game is a breathing nightmare, no doubt, but I’ve found the sections in the house—the quiet moments when you’re exploring—to be far more frightful. The monsters’ hellish screeching might unsettle, but, ultimately, you know what they’ll do. When you’re in the farmhouse, and hear footsteps inauspiciously plod upstairs, you have no clue what’ll happen.Returnal feels like a next-gen game. Take a peep:The game is freakin’ gorgeous. You get the standard next-gen fidelity benchmarks—4K resolution and a framerate of 60 frames per second—but the beauty of Returnal is more than mere numbers. It’s how moonlight peeks through the forest canopy, or how blue-tendril fauna arcs toward Selene in moments of respite. It’s the way snow shuffles in the wind. It’s the way fog parts as you stroll through buried tombs. Returnal moves at a brisk pace, but I’ve spent long moments just standing still, drinking in the sights.I’d further go on a limb and say that, at the moment, Returnal is debatably the fastest-loading big-budget video game out right now. You can cold boot—or go from clicking on Returnal’s dashboard tile icon to playing the game—in under 20 seconds. Fast-traveling within one biome doesn’t trigger a loading screen. Even moving between zones barely registers a load. If you look closely, you’ll see a minor blip while sprinting between two biomes. For all intents and purposes it’s a seamless transition. Seriously, get a load of this:The haptics, too, are unlike anything I’ve felt in a PS5 game. There’s that trigger-tension alt-fire thing, which feels fantastically tactile. Even the vibrations are more subtle and varied than other games I’ve played on PS5. Somehow, developers at Housemarque were able to replicate the pitter-patter of rainfall so that, when it rains in the game, your controller mimics the rhythm and intensity, as if you were holding your hands out, palms up, in an April shower. That’s not to say other PS5 games haven’t previously made use of the DualSense’s haptics. There’s just a world of difference between using them in the most literal sense (get hit, take damage, controller rumbles) and using them in creative, savvy, eye-opening ways like Returnal often does.Last fall, Astro’s Playroom arguably made the strongest case for the next generation of video game consoles. As a pre-installed game on every PS5—typically the sort of thing you’d either ignore or delete—Astro pulled double duty as a solid platformer and as a built-in technical demonstration for what the DualSense controller could do. It was a neat game, the general consensus suggested, but served more as a harbinger for what PS5 games could really do. Just gotta wait for one to come along. Returnal is that game. That’s not to say Returnal isn’t devoid of archaic bullshit, nor to absolve Returnal of said bullshit. Exhibit A: There is no official way to save and quit out of the game. A run in Returnal can last hours, especially if you’re combing through every room in every biome for as many resources as you can scrounge up. That you can’t save your game and pivot to something else smacks of a design decision from a prior, less accommodating era of gaming. If, for whatever reason, your PS5 turns off, you’re screwed, out potentially hours of carefully earned progress.(Speaking personally, my apartment has a curious setup where the living room power is tied to a light switch that rests at head level above our sofa. Sometimes, people accidentally lean into this switch, turning off the power for everything in the room, including my PS5. Thankfully, that hasn’t happened while I’ve been playing Returnal, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t plagued with anxiety about that possibility while knee-deep in a solid run.)I can’t even begin to see the logic behind this strange decision. In a reviewer’s guide provided to Kotaku, Sony, Returnal’s publisher, suggested using the PS5’s “rest mode” as a workaround. You can pause the game at any point, and putting the console into “rest” will suspend your game. In my experience, this trick hasn’t failed. But I’m an edge case, having devoted nearly every hour of my free time over the past nine days toward playing this game. Most players likely won’t be in that position. Off the top of my head, I’m thinking of people who share a PS5, or people who work erratic schedules, or people who can otherwise only play video games in sporadic bursts. At the end of the day, designing the game without a save function at all sure feels like a callous choice meant to wring attention from players who might not always have that attention to spare.When asked whether or not save functionality will be implemented in the future, representatives for Housemarque said the company is focused on Returnal’s launch and that there are no “further plans to announce at this time.”During one stellar run—I made it to the fifth biome (!!!) without taking a single hit—I tripped.I held my left thumbstick maybe three degrees too far to the right, and stepped directly into a bottomless pool of 33º F water. This didn’t kill me—I respawned in the same room with a third of my health bar missing—but it sure threw me off my game. (It also reset my “adrenaline” meter, which is basically a kill-streak that grants you bonus effects, like increased melee damage, for consecutively taking out enemies without getting hit). Sure enough, within a few rooms, I died. Set yourself up for success all you want. Nothing can compensate for a sudden and total loss of momentum.I tried to imagine what Selene was thinking in that moment. I got nothing. She dies too quickly. Then she wakes up. She dusts herself off. She’s ready to go—or not. There’s always tomorrow, which, for her, will be the same as today, and the next day, and every day.Last month, in an essay for The Atlantic, Devon Powers, an associate professor at Temple University, addressed the “constrained yet predictable rhythm” many of us surely feel every day.“This little world is equal parts dull and intense; everyone I know is sad, exhausted, antsy, and resigned,” Powers wrote. “I can’t wait to leave these confines behind, and yet this world is mine.”As you repeatedly make your way through Atropos, you’ll find Selene’s deceased remains, presumably left behind in previous attempts to escape. Some of these are accompanied by an audio log. These detail Selene’s inner monologues from past escape attempts that happened before the game’s inciting event. Selene, your Selene, will then remark on these recordings. It’s a neat way to not only tell Selene’s present-day story but to shade in the story of her (many, many) pasts.“There are certain…obstacles I don’t look forward to re-experiencing,” Selene says in one of those scout logs. Later—many, many deaths later—Selene says, “There are certain…sacrifices I do look forward to re-experiencing.”At that moment, I think I understood what may have gone through Selene’s head when I unwittingly steered her into a pool of ice water and then condemned her to yet another brutal demise: absolutely nothing. It’s just…the way things are. What’re you gonna do?I’ve found sticking to routine to be a personal salve—an imperative necessity, even, in terms of sanity—for the past 15 months. The routine is a comfort; it’s always there, because it’s the only thing still there. You fall into it. Some days, the overwhelmingly upsetting state of the world is a slight hum in the back of your head you can shut out. Some days it’s a lot. And on those days you can’t help but feel the urge to throw in the towel.And then you wake up. You dust yourself off. You give it another go—or you don’t. There’s always tomorrow.."

Returnal for PC untethers the game from its PS5 exclusive constraints, unlocking better controls with keyboard and mouse, higher frame rates and flexible resolution options including super ultrawide 32:9, and bumps up the visual quality to an even higher standard. PS5 owners might have been first to play this mysterious bullet hell roguelike, but PC players get to enjoy it in its definitive state.Returnal is one of those shooters that benefits enormously from PC performance and peripherals. The more frames you can get, the smoother the experience, and the more fluid and responsive movement and aiming become. Though a DualSense controller is supported, it’d be foolish to forgo the accuracy and versatility of a keyboard and mouse. Playing Returnal on PS5 with the DualSense was immersive, sure, but I found myself forced to use weapons with homing properties, so as to alleviate some of the frustration that comes with using analog sticks to aim. On PC, every weapon feels lethal thanks to the mouse.While most players will opt for lower visual quality to keep the frame rates as high as possible, those with higher-end systems can use their investment to make Returnal look sublime. The alien environments come alive with the generous number of graphics options all cranked to the max, and Returnal quickly cements itself as one of the best-looking games out there.Most environments are darker which contrasts brilliantly with the neon-lit attacks. Newcomers may find it tough to track and dodge enemy bullets with the sheer number of particles on screen but, as is the case for most bullet hell games, experience over time will make encounters easier to read and less overwhelming. Just get used to dying a lot, as this game leans heavily into trial and error.Aiding low to mid-tier hardware are the many upscaling options. The developer has confirmed that DLSS 3.0 and FSR 2 are on their way in a future update, but players can already make use of smart upscaling to gain additional performance. This is a huge benefit to those holding off upgrading their PC and trying to get a couple more years out of their current specs.Following a patch deployed close to the game’s launch, performance has been smooth 99% of the time for my 3700X/3070/32 GB rig. This is largely due to the exceptional graphics options menu, which overlays the gameplay and immediately showcases changes. This pairs with the superb benchmarking run to make honing in on perfect settings as simple as possible. The other 1% of the time, performance suffers from occasional hitches when moving between areas. This is also present on the PS5 version and, after a few hours, you do get used to it. It normally isn’t an issue, as I’m rarely in combat when moving quickly between rooms, but on the rare occasion where it does hiccup during a fight, it can be very frustrating. Avoiding hits is a huge part of Returnal’s gameplay as it impacts both weapon enhancements and maximum health, so any performance problems become extremely noticeable. Once keyboard and mouse controls are configured and graphics settings are fine-tuned, the planet of Atropos awaits players. There are mysteries to be discovered around every corner and it’s this curiosity for story progression, while getting more powerful gear, that will keep players engaged with this roguelike. Not only are there alien enemies, but the environments themselves have their own unexpected characteristics, alongside pickups that can be either a help or a hindrance.This roguelike demands trial and error not just through its challenging combat, but also in the items players pick up. It’s easy to accidentally nerf yourself for the next few encounters, making for an extra layer of danger when deciding which alien artifacts to equip or to outright avoid.There’s a surprising amount of story to absorb in Returnal, though much of it is open to interpretation through the symbols and hints laced throughout the game. Even the main character, Selene, is shrouded in mystery and not entirely trustworthy as a narrator. This horror show quickly turns into a psychological thriller and I found the downtime between fights, where you learn that little more about what’s going on, very compelling. However, for those who just want to shoot things, perhaps with a buddy, the Tower of Sisyphus mode is the place to let loose. This is where the Returnal’s longevity lies. It cuts out the story and replaces it with endless waves of enemies and the upgrades needed to help deal with them.Thanks to a recent patch that fixed the majority of performance issues that I was having, I can happily call Returnal on PC the “definitive version.” It has the looks, the performance, and the best controls, ready to reward those who waited for the PS5’s timed-exclusivity period to end with a compelling, mysterious story and top-tier bullet hell gameplay. 9Mack is slowly grinding his way to Level 100.

Returnal Review for PS5.Roguelikes and roguelites have almost been exclusively locked to the indie scene and are almost always either top-down or 2D. Although still technically an indie studio, Housemarque is changing that through Returnal, its Sony-published AAA roguelite shooter. Even though this is a departure for the Finnish developer and different take on the genre, it’s easily the team’s best and most well-realized game and an overall brilliant experience.Returnal is a unique roguelite, but it still follows the rules that its two-dimensional counterparts have established. Dying or closing the game returns players to the starting point and forfeits all of the non-permanent items earned along the way. Levels, gear, and upgrades are procedurally compiled together to make each run different. And, since it is a roguelite and not a roguelike, there are a small handful of persistent upgrades that either make successive bouts a touch easier or unlock other areas of the map, Metroid-style.From the most basic standpoint, Returnal doesn’t stray too far from genre staples, but it still uses that traditional framework to great effect. Almost everything in the game is some sort of risk or choice. Cursed chests, heath packs, or crystal clusters may yield powerful rewards, but could also unleash a malfunction; a risk that can be prematurely bypassed by spending a rare currency used for obtaining new stuff or a life-saving revive. Challenge rooms are difficult, but yield grand rewards upon completion. Attachable parasites boost some stats while harming other ones.The game is intelligently designed in a way to push players to take risks and make their experience more interesting as the difficulty is stacked against those who play it safe. An easier game would be less exciting. Constantly weighing those dangers while also picking through the vast array of weapons and upgrades also ensures that no two runs feel similar.The loop of starting fresh and seeing what mix of guns and gear the RNG gods have sprinkled around is an addictive treat, given the possibilities the ocean of variables grants players. And this ocean gets even deeper as the roguelite elements come into play and unlock progressively more mods, weapons, consumables, and more, further sweetening the loop as the hours fly by. Unfortunately, levels layouts aren’t as diverse and comparatively start repeating quite soon in a way that the items never do.The combat puts the arsenal of gear to the test and is where the game comes into its own. It’s a fast-paced third-person shooter with the amount of precision that would make PlatinumGames jealous. An air dash, generous dodge, a blazing fast sprint speed, and a sparse amount of recovery frames give players the ultimate control over Selene, the protagonist, as she zips around slaying all sorts of aliens and robots that fill the screen with large projectiles and explosions.It’s demanding, but routinely fulfilling because of the tightness of the controls, utility of the weapons, rock-solid high frame rate, and intuitive use of the DualSense’s adaptive triggers. Housemarque hasn’t made a third-person shooter like this before, but its work making responsive arcade games has truly paid off and translated to this new genre phenomenally well.Returnal’s combat would be exceptional in a standard third-person shooter, but it’s made even better by its roguelite half and vice versa. Since the shooting is so satisfying by itself, it’s natural to want to do it over and over again in a replayable setting. And the engrossing roguelite loop of unlocking more stuff is improved because of the astonishingly smooth combat that’s required to get those unlocks. Rewarding shooting begets more rewarding unlocks which begets more rewarding shooting and that symbiotic process repeats over and over again — ironically — without feeling repetitive. It’s a perfect storm of intrinsic and extrinsic incentives.Returnal’s world is about as unique and awe-inspiring as its gameplay, too. Each of its six biomes are radically different from one another, but are common in their truly alien feel. These places are so foreign and are not only riddled with bizarre extraterrestrial flora and fauna, but also gigantic statues and structures that belong to a mysterious sentient alien race not too unlike the space jockeys in Ridley Scott’s Alien (sans all the phallic imagery).Fusing together technology and buildings from such otherworldly sources provides the constant sense of wonder that good sci-fi has — an aspect that becomes even more clear as the game leans more into its Lovecraftian inspirations. The Interstellar-esque soundtrack also further reinforces this mood and is equally chilling and breathtaking as the visuals it complements, creating an unforgettable and consistent audiovisual presentation.The game’s world and roguelite nature are even justified in its story. Selene finds herself after she’s crashed on an alien planet and is reborn after every death for some unknown reason. And if that wasn’t absurd enough, she also stumbles upon audio logs of herself that she doesn’t remember recording.The premise is an inherently engaging central mystery that seamlessly works in tandem with its mechanics and provides a narrative incentive to progress further in the loop to get some answers. Like Hades, additional story bits are even unlocked after dying as more recordings and alien tablets litter the newly configured environment. Listening to the journeys of all the other Selenes is unsettling as the logs slowly get darker and darker and further ratchets up the intrigue.Like its gameplay, Returnal’s story is not force-fed to the player. It’s semi-Lynchian in its approach as a lot of its narrative is implied, found in audiotapes, or told in fragments or flashbacks. Very little of it seems to be an objective fact and is instead meant for players to infer their own meaning from the beats it presents. And while a more traditional presentation would have been more digestible, Returnal gives players enough to chew on to be gratifying in its vagueness, especially considering its dark, ambiguous ending. Understanding everything isn’t the point as the process of soaking in its tone and reflecting on the emotions it evokes can be as valuable as a more conventionally told tale.However, Returnal is unambiguously and thoroughly an outstanding game. Mixing the RPG progression and ever-evolving suite of roguelite hooks with a frenetic third-person shooter results in a new experience with two halves that make each other better. As it did with the PS3, Vita, and PS4, Housemarque has once again provided Sony with another launch-era hit and in doing so has created a rewarding, replayable, and revolutionary game that’s hopefully the foundation for other future AAA titles that are as clever with the roguelite blueprint.GameRevolution reviewed Returnal on PS5.

Returnal,Chris Carter,Destructoid,https://www.destructoid.com/stories/review-returnal-626623.phtml,"darkFinally, another PS5 game!Yes folks, you heard that right, Returnal is a bonafide PS5 release. Is it worth (gulp) $70? It really depends on your penchant for roguelikes.Returnal (PS5)
Developer: Housemarque
Publisher: Sony
Released: April 30, 2021
MSRP: $69.99Housemarque is back and I’m into it. Ever since Super Stardust HD they immediately appeared on my radar and haven’t left ever since. While people are quick to point out more well-known games like Resogun when talking about The House, I’m particularly fond of a few of their lesser-known titles like Outland, which was a fantastic take on Ikaruga meets platforming.This time around the studio is reinventing itself with a third-person shooter roguelike/roguelite. The latter bit is important, because like Hades, you’re going to be keeping permanent upgrades, and in the case of Returnal, shortcuts. So if you loathe the idea of “starting all over” upon every death or failed run, that’s not as much of a concern here. The gimmick involves a very Prometheus-esque setup of a woman (Selene) crash-landing on an alien planet filled with creatures that would make H.R. Giger squirm.Every time Selene dies, she appears right back at the crash site, and needs to figure out why she’s there; amid a bit of coming to terms with personal trauma added in for good measure. As a result, Selene feels more like a character than a lot of similar genre staples, but there is a good degree of subtlety to avoid Returnal descending into cloying shlock.Mechanically, you’ll get to your eventual endpoint by huffing it and air dashing through a handful of biomes, as you upgrade both an in-run track (that you lose after death) and an overarching permanent track. It takes some getting used to, but the adaptive triggers and rumble are neatly used here, allowing for regular fire if you slightly press down on L2 to aim, and alt-fire if you slam down hard. Each biome pits you against a big boss at the end, then you move to the next biome, get more upgrades, and try your luck again.[brid video=”770592″ player=”12899″ title=”Returnal%20Review” duration=”258″ description=”Destructoid’s review of Returnal.We’re NOT taking a look at a new Wicca Phase Springs Eternal album, but a video game named Returnal from Housemarque for the PS5. But is Returnal as good as the album name potential? Find out in today’s review!” uploaddate=”2021-04-29″ thumbnailurl=”//cdn.brid.tv/live/partners/10260/thumb/770592_t_1619718734.jpg” contentUrl=”//cdn.brid.tv/live/partners/10260/sd/770592.mp4″]It’s very addictive because the “lite” bit of the rogue moniker is prevalent in the minute-to-minute design. Returnal doesn’t feel overly oppressive for the sake of it, as enemies can be handled through pure skill and twitch action and don’t have many opportunities to cheese or otherwise one-shot players so long as you have situational awareness.Weapons also pack a punch, as do the vast majority of upgrades. Returnal uses a clever risk-reward system too, which can grant you access to better equipment if you chance that a marked item might give you a “malfunction” penalty. Typically you can heal these off with other items and/or some sort of imposed challenge goal, like “collect 200 currency.”With this gambling system in mind, the pacing is extremely on-point. Typically upgrades are always within reach, and if they aren’t, I can try my luck with the curse mechanic that can also be adapted to with enough time and skill. Even the chance-based systems of Returnal can feel fair and balanced. A helpful map that marks items without guesswork is a huge plus.The game’s pacing also highly benefits from a moody atmosphere that is haunting with 3D audio on PS5. It’s unsettling pretty much at all times, which is a very cool way to play a tense roguelike. At one point I had to pause Returnal because it got too tense. It sounds hyperbolic, but it was a good run! The real ones understand.It’s all good so far right? Well likewise, the more you play, the more you learn and adapt; the more it can become too familiar. In each individual biome I didn’t find the enemy or environment variety to be as interesting as I’d like, and if you’re stuck on a particular area for a while, it can start to get very samey. It’s exacerbated by lengthy periods between permanent upgrades, which can result in a lack of tangible in-game progress: a problem for people who don’t feel like picking up mechanics is its own reward. Daily challenges and leaderboards might coax more out of a specific audience (but I’m going to ignore them).Then there’s the rest mode requirement. In Returnal, you need to rest mode your PS5 in order to save progress during a hiatus. So if you’re on a really lengthy good run and want to play something else, you’re pressing your luck. Given how many issues I’ve had with rest mode since launch, I’m always uneasy using it, even if all my tests haven’t seen any issues.Returnal is a mostly thrilling sci-fi action romp that suffers from a lack of scale at times. In the moment, I’m completely fixated on my run, upgrading like a fiend, and dashing around for iFrames like I was playing a Capcom game. But after that run ends and I’m looking at the bigger picture, Returnal can feel a little smaller than it actually is. Keep that in mind before you take the pricey plunge.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]GoodSolid and definitely has an audience. There could be some hard-to-ignore faults, but the experience is fun.

Returnal,Donovan Erskine,Shacknews,https://www.shacknews.com/article/124202/returnal-review-all-you-need-is-kill,"New to Shacknews? Signup for a Free AccountAlready have an account? Login NowHousemarque's newest game is a brutal roguelike that's expertly crafted.Though games like Dark Souls and Cuphead have been criticized for being difficult for the sake of being difficult, there’s true merit in a game that feels impossible to beat when you first pick it up. One that you simply must give 100% effort at all moments lest you be struck down swiftly. Housemarque delivers the latest uber-challenging game with Returnal, a roguelike that excels at just about everything it tries to do, while also packing in fascinating mystery.I can best describe Returnal as Alien meets Groundhog day. After crash-landing and finding herself stranded on Atropos, a strange planet, ASTRA Scout Selene faces grave threats in addition to an unraveling mystery. Doomed to relive the experience every time she dies, players will have to beat the odds in order to figure out what's going on and get Selene back home.I really love how the developers weave the game’s narrative into the roguelike gameplay. With the nature of the genre, players will die and start from the beginning a lot. The story finds Selene stuck in a twisted time loop, where she constantly relives her ship crashing, and is forced once again to battle powerful creatures. It creates a really interesting mystery, while actually adding some value to dying. Although it still sucks to have to start from scratch, it’s more than just getting your progress wiped and hitting “play again.” Things are constantly changing, and there are even ways to help yourself on future runs.Though the game is certainly action first, Returnal has the atmospheric tension of a horror game. Not only are the environments twisted and off-putting, but some of the discoveries made along the way were enough to creep me out a few times. There’s sequences where players walk through the halls of an old home, and it feels like a scene pulled directly from P.T.To put it quite frankly - Returnal is one of the most challenging video games I’ve played in years. It’s beyond cliche to compare a game to the likes of Dark Souls simply based on difficulty, but I really do believe that Returnal will sit beside it as some of the most difficult titles in the modern era. It’s a full-on bullet hell, with players constantly having to juggle multiple enemies at once, all while making sure not to fall victim to the hazardous environments.It’s a game that really forces you to learn and adapt to everything it throws at you. There’s a wide variety of hostile enemies and creatures you’ll come across, each of which has their own unique behavioral pattern. There are foes that fire a spread of attacks, some that leap forward and pounce at you, ones that shoot homing attacks, and several others. As I grew to recognize and anticipate upcoming attacks, the combat really began to shine.Returnal really clicks when you get a good feel for movement and traversal. Using my jump and dash maneuvers to dodge attacks, sprinting around the area leaping from platform to platform was nothing short of thrilling.There’s a variety of weapons that players can find and take into battle in Returnal. You have handguns, rifles, shotguns, rocket launchers, and more. In addition, each weapon features an alt-fire mode, which can be used to deal big damage. Some of the alt-fire modes include an explosive blast shell, an electrifying shock stream, and a tracking swarm. It’s all completely randomized, so any weapon could potentially have any alt-fire mode.The combat in Returnal is just about perfect. The weapons feel great, while also being distinctly unique from one another. The ability to time your reload and overload a weapon adds another mechanic for players to master, and you can even use a sword in close range to deal heavy damage and knock down shields. The combat mechanics combined with the frenetic movement make for a superb roguelike experience.There are a series of bosses in Returnal that players will need to take down in order to make meaningful progress. Like any other enemy, bosses have a specific arsenal of attacks and a behavioral pattern that players can study and adapt to. I must’ve gotten killed by Phrike - the game’s first major boss - half a dozen times before I was able to take him out. Successfully killing bosses in Returnal is another level of rewarding and very satisfying.Like any good Roguelike, there are a ton of different power ups and stat-affecting items to find during your adventure on Atropos. Artifacts are items that are stored in the player’s inventory and provide boosts such as increased damage or Obolites (currency). Consumables grant a temporary gain and are limited to a small handful of slots.One of the really interesting and cool items in Returnal are Parasites. These small creatures physically bind themselves to the player and offer really powerful bonuses. However, they also come with a strong negative side effect. Parasites can be stacked, but the player can not remove them through conventional means. It creates a strategic dynamic where the player has to decide what they’re willing to sacrifice in order to get the edge on enemies.When you die, all of your Artifacts, Consumables, Obolites, and Parasites are lost. It can be incredibly frustrating, but it’s those high stakes that keep the player on edge at literally every moment.With as brutal and unforgiving as Returnal is, I really appreciate how clear and concise the level design and map layout is. The map shows all of the explored areas and indicates what doors players have and haven’t entered. What’s more, it also illustrates which of these doors lead to side paths, which ones continue the main path, and which doors will take you to a boss battle. If I want to spend some time gathering loot and resources before taking on the next boss, I can easily plan out my course of action.This is also really helpful when you consider that the world of Atropos is procedurally generated. Every time you die and start over, everything is moved around and rearranged. Though specific rooms may remain the same, they’re in different locations and are incorporated into brand new layouts. Though I liked how it kept the experience fresh, I wasn’t a fan of how the randomness impacted weapons and loot.Weapons, Artifacts, Consumables, and Parasites are also completely randomized in Returnal. Though this is indeed a staple of the roguelike genre, it’s frustrating that some runs feel doomed to fail when all the game serves up to you are sidearms, or if there are no bonuses worth your while. For a game as unforgiving as Returnal is, it sucks when you feel like it wasn’t entirely your fault that you failed.Returnal is strictly exclusive to the PS5 as it’s one of the handful of “next-gen” games that aren't playable on its predecessor. Aside from being an excellent roguelike, Returnal is a technical marvel. The locations are all so gorgeous and incredibly detailed. Even in moments where my screen was flooded with action and chaos, the PS5 held strong and I experienced practically no major stutters or hiccups.Returnal is also the true showcase of just how spectacular the DualSense controller is. Players pull down the L1 trigger halfway to aim down sights, and you can feel a bit of draw and kickback when you do so. Pulling the trigger all the way is how you activate alt-fire. I originally thought this would be confusing and lead to screw-ups, but the DualSense tech makes it so easy that I don’t think it happened a single time.The controller also emits a sound cue from its built-in speaker to let players know when their alt-fire is fully charged and ready to be used again. If you stand still, you can even feel the raindrops falling and hitting Selene’s spacesuit, thanks to haptic feedback.Housemarque reminds audiences that it’s got the chops to be one of the premier-tier game developers with Returnal. The game is wholly difficult with a roster of powerful enemies and bosses to overcome, but also gives the player everything they need in order to succeed. The game just gets better and better as you go on, as recognizing patterns and learning to adapt is endlessly rewarding. Despite some issues with RNG, it’s hard to knock this creepy sci-fi adventure. Returnal is a must-play PS5 exclusive for any roguelike fan itching for their latest challenge.This review is based on a digital download code provided by the publisher.

Returnal,James Billcliffe,VG247,https://www.vg247.com/2021/04/29/returnal-review-ps5/,"Returnal has a problem.Its nightmare scenario: ‘What if you were trapped in an endless cycle, repeating the same thing again and again’, has gotten a lot less scary since we’ve all been trapped inside for 18 months.How do you make an everyday situation terrifying again?The answer is tentacles. Lots and lots of tentacles.With its high-budget visuals, flashy presentation, and Sony first-party backing, it’s easy to assume that Returnal is a similar sort of spectacle action-adventure we’ve seen loads of times around the launch of a new console, and a massive departure from what we’ve seen from Housemarque in the past.But from your first proper encounter, it becomes clear that Returnal is just as much Super Stardust as it is Star Trek.All of the familiar ‘rogue-like’ elements are here in force: starting back at the beginning when you die, making your way from level to level through different ‘rooms’ which change order every time, and a heavy reliance on luck to create god runs from a varied assortment of high risk/tiny reward power ups.But where Returnal sets itself apart from others in the roguelike genre is the fusion of these gameplay hooks with a sci-fi story and positioning more akin to a triple-a blockbuster.Returnal follows the story of Selene, a space pilot for the Astra Corporation, as she tries to escape her fate after crash landing on the uncharted, hostile and shifting planet of Atropos.The trippy, esoteric narrative plays out in an intriguingly non-linear fashion thanks to Returnal’s rogue-like elements, starting out denser than a black hole before drawing slowly into clearer light. 
 
Taking different paths through the same levels yields different audio logs, snippets of dialogue, and cyphers that piece together underlying lore. The intermittent first-person, more horror-focused sections - which trigger as you work your way through multiple cycles - are spooky highlights that help establish the game’s wider motifs and set the tone for your journey.The metaphors and inspirations at play are rich and extremely spoiler-heavy to discuss, but pull from everything from Greek mythology to the mighty Blue Oyster Cult.I’m normally not a fan of audio logs and the like, but in Returnal they’re well-spaced and cohesive enough not to interrupt the flow of gameplay, and in the absence of a traditional narrative feel important enough to pay attention to, but also brief enough not to get tuned out.So while there’s a lot of emphasis on story, the Housemarque DNA shines brightly in Returnal’s gameplay.From the slippery movement to the classic shoot ‘em up, bullet hell style projectiles that fill the screen, it’s easy to chart the studio’s evolution from Super Stardust via Dead Nation and Resogun to full 3D.As you make your way through the six varied environments, you can dash and slash through bullets, so once you’ve trained your brain to dodge into projectiles as well as avoid them, things turn into an intense and deliberate slalom as you progressively build out your character by finding better weapons, suit artifact upgrades, and health boost pickups.Of course, you’ll lose pretty much all of this should you die - save for a single type of persistent resource - which as usual in rogue-like games, adds a palpable sense of jeopardy to every scenario. This is especially true in the fantastic spectacle boss fights, where I caught my mouth hanging open more than once. 
 
On top of the mysteriously superpowered baubles you find laying around, Selene also interacts with the local flora and fauna to augment her equipment, collecting double-edged parasites and taking chances on Malignant items.Chests and health upgrades afflicted with Malignancy still give you the upside of their regular counterpart, but carry a chance of making your suit malfunction - an often powerful debuff which you have to complete a difficult challenge to clear.While you can try and avoid Malignant items, you’ll quickly end up underpowered against increasingly difficult enemies - especially mini-bosses - so you’ll frequently need to take the plunge.Parasites on the other hand feel a bit weak in general, with their huge downsides often not worth the meagre boost.Rogue-likes are often like this, and I always feel like it just discourages you from interacting with the systems at all - but at least it’s not wildly imbalanced.One gameplay mechanic that really works in Returnal though is how it uses the PS5’s DualSense controller. It’s a real innovation that makes the game impossible to really replicate on previous PlayStations, or anywhere else.How it works is that the DualSense’s adaptive trigger tech effectively doubles the functionality of the left trigger, with a half-press aiming down the sights of your regular weapon, while a more forceful full press triggers your gun’s limited secondary fire.This, coupled with a punishing active reload system - where you have to fire again at the right time during a reload to avoid a lengthy cool down - makes for brilliantly engaging and tactile shooting. 
 
It’s a lot to think about, especially when you’re dealing with so many enemy projectiles on-screen at the same time, but it’s a really interesting example of how these technologies can have demonstrable mechanical applications as well as decorative.Speaking of decorative though, the haptic feedback also does a lot to enhance Returnal’s retro-future aesthetic, where the clunking triggers and sound effects channel Alien and Blade Runner in the best way, meshing with the analogue feel of your ship and suit’s monochrome monitors and booping synthetic sounds perfectly.We’ve seen Hades get the melding of story and rogue-like, run-driven gameplay very, very right before, but I don’t feel like it works quite as well in Returnal.While the opening hours are a borderline contemplative, exploratory experience, the difficulty explodes as you start to reach the last area, making every subsequent run a massive slog.I think I died three times from booting up the game to reaching the last boss the first time - by the time I’d rolled the credits it was closer to 20. It caused the story progression to come off as lumpy, with a chasmic gap in what up to that point had been a delicately smooth curve.I just want to know what happens to the space lady, now I’m stuck fighting the same dudes over and over without the through-thread of new story beats because I’ve already found all the audio logs and other nuggets. 
 
Some of the more capricious tendencies of rogue-like games start to chafe, when you’re really invested in piecing the end of the story together. It’s frustrating when you’re excited to unravel the mystery, only to have to throw away a 40-minute run because of things that feel outside of your control.Sometimes Malignant items give you massive debuffs to damage or health which can only be cleared by things that spawn randomly - like opening a door or chest with a key - so you’re pretty much goosed.It’s not insurmountably difficult by any means (although it seems other reviewers died a lot more than me), maybe it was just unlucky variance, but it did seem to interrupt Returnal’s pace and flow - although without the spike, the critical path would have been significantly shorter.While Returnal’s marriage of rogue-like loops and serpentine story isn’t perfect, it’s a dark, engaging, and innovative experience which provides plenty of gameplay grunt to match its brain-teasing plot.There’s symbolism to ponder, Easter eggs to spot, and tons of memorable moments across the 20 or so hours it’ll take you to reach the end the first time, with yet more to unlock and mess with after you’ve mastered the core concepts on your initial clear.Platform reviewed: PS5 - code provided by publisher.You're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!

PlayStation fans are likely familiar with Finnish game studio Housemarque, whose best modern games have masterfully combined classic arcade chops with modern flourishes. Yet even its biggest PS3 and PS4 games (Super Stardust HD, Resogun, Nex Machina) have mostly felt like translations from classic cabinets, thanks to fixed perspectives and allegiant action. Blow stuff up, aim for the high score, game over, and repeat.This week, Returnal sees the studio aim its pedigree at a much higher scope: a game that combines the pure action of '80s arcade games with the plot, production value, and world exploration of a full-blown ""adventure"" game. It's as if someone at Housemarque looked at 1981's Galaga running next to 2018's God of War and said, ""Can we somehow combine these two?""The result feels like a statement game for Housemarque, arguably in the same way that 2019's Control solidified Remedy Studios' own reputation—though this effort isn't quite as successful. At its best, Returnal delivers the studio's finest-yet action and tension within a phenomenal 3D-shooting system. I've gone to sleep thinking about the game's best blasting moments, eager to wake up the next day and return (returnal?) for ""one more run."" Yet at its worst, Returnal's roguelite trappings sometimes threaten to bring the whole package down—especially if you're not very good at high-speed shooter games.Returnal will be some people's favorite game of 2021. But even those players should prepare to strap in for a bumpy, weird start. More dead Selenes appear, usually clutching personal audio recording devices that spoonfeed more of the game's mysterious plot. You'll add to that pile of corpses before long, since the opening tutorial segment includes a brutally difficult monster that traps you in a pit and kills in two hits. Immediately after your death, the screen flashes black, and the opening crash-on-a-planet sequence plays again with different camera angles; Groundhog Day stuff, but instead of ""I've Got You, Babe,"" your mornings always open with screams and smoke.Your version of Selene remembers dying and coming back to life this time, but the world you've landed on looks different. The opening door reveals a new zone to run through. Different dead Selenes lie in different places (sometimes with new audio logs). Different rooms, lairs, and caverns appear, now full of new arrangements of enemies, items, and secrets.Hence, we're in roguelite territory, and the object is to die-and-retry while unraveling Atropos' mysteries and finding a mix of temporary and permanent upgrades within every randomly generated sequence. That's different than a roguelike, where each death starts you from scratch; roguelites bring you back to life with some upgrades remaining persistent after every death, while other stuff vanishes if you don't use or spend it before you die. (The latter is much more common in the modern gaming era, with popular examples like Hades and Dead Cells; comparatively, Spelunky is the best example of a modern roguelike, if not the titular PC classic itself, Rogue.)By the time you find that stronger monster again, you'll have recovered a permanent ""alt-fire"" mode for your gun that shoots a charged, concentrated blast, along with a likely assortment of temporary upgrades. You'll get stronger, in both permanent and temporary ways, and you'll keep going.But you'll also keep dying.Returnal would rather you learn its systems within the course of the game's die-and-retry loop, instead of breaking its brutality out to a tutorial. To some extent, I get it. This serves a plot that hinges on Selene's confused dedication to breaking a time loop, and plot morsels emerge at a steady rate—which, I assure you, I haven't spoiled here in the slightest. Still, you'll have a better time if you understand the type of difficulty you're getting yourself into.Like Demon's Souls before it, Returnal establishes a unique, tough-as-nails ruleset for combat, only this game's take feels so much more like a Housemarque game. In a major departure from the Souls-like genre, Selene's default movement speed is ""damned fast,"" and this is helped by unlimited ""run"" stamina (for even faster movement) and an instant dash-dodge button, which needs a second to recharge. In fact, there's no ""stamina"" limitation anywhere in Returnal. Selene's spacesuit clearly has some nice batteries built in.This speed is imperative because players see Selene from a tight third-person angle as she runs through a mix of open fields and fallen-apart architecture. To live, you'll have to keep moving, lest you get caught by waves of enemy bullets (usually large, slow-moving laser orbs) coming from all sides, along with foes that hunt for Selene's body and pounce with melee attacks. To organically encourage your ""git gud"" mentality, Housemarque offers built-in help in the form of ""adrenaline,"" a meter that fills up every time Selene kills a foe without taking damage. Get your adrenaline high enough, and you'll get perks. Some are combat boosts like increased melee damage (for the sword you eventually find), but others contribute directly to combat visibility. One perk makes ghosts of enemies appear if they're behind cover. Another creates a warning radius around Selene's body, lighting up to indicate whether you're being targeted by bullets (white), turrets (purple), or pouncing foes (red) in any direction.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

Returnal,Kevin Mitchell,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/returnal-pc-review/,"Returnal PC is a release of the popular roguelike and bullet hell game from Sony, originally released in 2021 as an exclusive title for the PlayStation 5 console. While the original launch, subsequent fixes, and feature updates happened over time, PC players can rejoice that the re-release will have everything rolled into an excellent package upon the game’s release to Steam and the Epic Games Store. First, however, you may ask yourself if purchasing the PC release is worth it. What new features does it offer?The answer is a resounding yes because you can access existing features like the in-game progress tracker, achievements, co-op mode, and the Tower of Sisyphus. In addition, you will also have access to additional tools unique to the PC version since many gaming computers are available on the market and are made differently. Tools in Returnal include five graphical pre-sets, in-game performance metrics, an FPS counter, a latency tracker, and a GPU and CPU tracking gauge. While it is possible to get Returnal running on your specific gaming PC, the developers included the above tools for a reason.Returnal takes place entirely on an alien planet called Atropos. The Sentients built an advanced civilization encompassing the entire planet, but Atropos’ environment has since reclaimed it. The Sentients are close to extinction as only the Severed remains of their population inhabit the planet. Advanced artifacts of their lost civilization are also scattered across the planet and will help you in your journey of breaking the cycle. From the hive mind structures of the Crimson Wastes to the terrifying depths of the underwater Abyssal Scar, there are five biomes on Atropos that you will traverse, each providing a unique challenge.I admit Atropos was a bit of a throwaway world for me. Nothing about it stood out to me from a visual or level design standpoint. Other games that were set in alien worlds were more successful. The only standout was the inclusion of the haunted houses used to explore Selene’s background. Everything else was just generic scenery, and it fell into the background.The protagonist of Returnal is Selene Vassos, voiced by Jane Perry (Hitman, Devils), a Greek American working for ASTRA as a deep space scout. As you further into the cycle, you will unravel Selene’s story as a child leading up to the events of her crash on Atropos. Selene’s story examines the hurt, guilt, and pain Selene felt after the events of her son and mother. The story is highly elevated and crosses the boundaries of parallel universes and dream sequences. We don’t know what is real or not. At one point, we are left to question if Selene is even an astronaut.Still, just like the tremendously crafted elevated horror movie, The Babadook, it shows us how trauma affects humankind and how people deal with it differently. The car crash is parallel to the Helios crashing on Atropos. Atropos is a dream sequence that pieces together the real-life events and people of Selene. In it, we learn about her grief, guilt, sadness, and anger because of events surrounding her child and mother.I didn’t catch it initially, but slight hints are dropped throughout the game. For instance, a throwaway voice line about leaving Helios later turned out to hint at her son, also named Helios. These little nuggets are spread throughout the game and will make all the difference in understanding the story.Returnal’s primary game mechanic comes from the Roguelike genre. After you die, you will start over again and lose all loot and the progress you gained before your death. However, most games, like Returnal, allow you to keep some upgrades to your character so you can become more powerful with every new playthrough.This includes abilities that allow you to access locked areas, which will help progress the story. Along with unlocking permanent abilities, you will understand how the game works and survive longer before your death. This all culminates in beating the game. In Returnal, beating the game is called breaking the cycle, which Selene appears to be stuck in since her crash landing on Atropos.Returnal is an immersive experience that hits you from three primary senses: touch, sight, and sound. Sony, Climax Studios, and Housemarque’s use of haptic feedback, 4K supported visuals, and 3D sound set Returnal apart from most recent Triple-A titles on the market. However, these features require much work from the player to enjoy, so you should expect to tinker with the game as soon as it is installed.Rain in Returnal will cause subtle haptic pulses that are procedurally synthesized at runtime, which makes your brain think you are standing in the rain on Atropos. These constant haptic pulses added to the immersion and made it feel like my hands were doing more than just holding a controller. There are also dynamic trigger effects, aka the ability to use focus aim by pulling halfway on the trigger or entering the alt-fire mode by fully holding the trigger down. However, you must plug a DualSense into your gaming PC to use this feature. One of the reasons why PC players love gaming on PCs is their use of a mouse and keyboard. So a DualSense controller’s requirement to experience one of the game’s features is a loss from the start. Plus, if you don’t own a PlayStation 5, you won’t just have one lying around, which defeats the purpose of a PC port.One benefit of owning a console is not having to worry about the PC requirements of a game. Unfortunately, this is where Returnal can cause frustration for PC players because the requirements to run Returnal on 4K with Ray Tracing are high. You will need a good gaming PC to run it using these settings. It took me a while to tweak my settings to avoid stuttering or lag in the game because Returnal is demanding on the GPU. Most of the time, the gauge pinged at 100%.Returnal uses 3D audio for its sound effects and soundtrack, which brings Atropos to life. I played with headphones on, using the available 3D audio options. Multiple times during my playthrough, I looked behind me because I thought the sound was coming from inside my house.However, this is another pain point of the game because you will need to use stereo headphones, have a system that supports Dolby Atmos, or use a 5.1 and 7.1 surround sound system. You may have to move your gaming rig around to accommodate, which may be more trouble than it’s worth. Trust me, however. It is worth it!Where Returnal shines on the PC over its console counterpart is its upscale features like DLSS and AMD FSR. In addition, the game also includes NVIDIA Image Scaling and VRS, which allows for the dynamic rendering of in-game assets. The game will render objects with distinct qualities based on their importance, allowing you to gain additional frames without negatively impacting quality. I gained 10 to 20 additional frames, which makes a difference.Unfortunately, getting Returnal to work on the PC with all the tools, gauges, and settings was a pain and most likely not worth it to the average player. In addition, finding the perfect balance between amazing graphics and outstanding performance was tedious. It killed my initial excitement for the game before I started it.Outside of DLSS and FSR, there is little else to be gained from Returnal from the PlayStation 5 version. The game’s mechanics, story, and features are all the same, albeit wrapped in an excellent package that is available from the port’s launch.Sony did a fantastic job porting another exclusive game on PC. The port includes all features in one polished package. However, getting the game to run can be challenging and a significant turnoff for the average PC player. Therefore, I only recommend it if you didn’t play it on the PlayStation 5 since the story, mechanics, and features are the same.In addition, I failed to connect with the game because it offers an insane learning curve through its use of two of the most challenging genres. I only beat the game because I loved uncovering Selene’s story and watching the movie-quality cut scenes, not the mechanics themselves.This game was reviewed using a copy of the game provided by the game's publisher,public relations company, developer or other for the express purpose of a review.

Returnal,Chris White,God is a Geek,https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/returnal-pc-review/,"February 15, 2023It’s hard to imagine that Housemarque’s Returnal came out almost two years ago. When it released on PS5, it set alight the capabilities of the platform and gave fans a blistering shooter filled with atmosphere, intensity, and lots of different genres that pushed the boundaries of both the console and gaming itself. Returnal on PC manages to capture everything it did on console, providing a smooth experience that not only looks incredible, but plays just as good as it ever did.You play as Selene, an employee of a team of scientists called Astra who’s job it is to document life across the cosmos. However, after crash-landing on Atropos, she gets stuck in a cycle that sees her returning to the crash site upon death, forced to repeat the same nightmare and face the same horrors upon this strange planet. It’s a simple premise executed with style, and although each time you die it feels as if nothing has been achieved, there’re certain things that remain with you, even after death.You start to uncover patterns, abilities, devices, and information that drip feeds you with a purpose to being on Atropos. Suit upgrades remain on you, as well as items that’ll help you get through certain blockades such as a teleportation system and a tool that cuts through previously unreachable areas. Various audio logs are scattered across the biomes, giving you some context to what’s happening, and after a few hours of playing, you’ll begin to piece together the story, as well as how to play Returnal.Atropos is a desolate planet, except for the alien lifeforms you encounter. Crumbling structures and statues litter the world, and alien artefacts are seldom found, giving some kind of context about what’s going on. The real joy of Returnal on PC is how you never know what you might find. Each cycle is different, presenting a new layout every time. When you think you know what’s happening or where you’re going, death rectifies that, thrusting you back into the unknown and forcing you to play cautiously all over again.The enemies are a mixed bag, all firing glowing orbs of destruction at you. They’re beautiful in a weird way, glowing reds, blues, and greens, firing at you consistently and relentlessly, always forcing you to dodge and evade with the hopes of getting in those vital attacks. Throughout Returnal, you’ll uncover new weapons that feel much like shotguns and assault rifles, all with alternative firing patterns, and once you die, they’re lost, however, there’s still the chance the next cycle with present you with that fancy new gun you got.Housemarque has designed Returnal in such an exquisite way. Layouts change, but certain patterns remain. Areas you come across at the beginning will be inaccessible, but new devices will allow you to finally access them. Other areas might simply have supplies or opportunities to upgrade or buff abilities and weapons, while others throw you into an intense battle against tons of enemies. You never know just what you’re going to face, but it’s such a staggeringly beautiful game that you’re always happy to repeat the cycle and see what lurks in the shadows in the hopes of uncovering something or somewhere new.For Returnal on PC, it ran at a smooth 60fps during gameplay on my modest rig on high setting, with some of the cutscenes causing a little stutter. For those with better graphics cards, there won’t be any issues, and even on low it looks great and runs superbly. Using a DualSense provided an almost identical experience when it came to adaptive triggers providing you change the setting, and the nuanced audio plays through the controller’s speaker, providing more of an atmosphere, as the excellent sound design has another method to thrive.Returnal on PC is just as fantastic as it was on the PlayStation 5. If you weren’t fortunate enough to play on console, the PC version is equally engaging and stunning, both in the way it looks and how it plays. For the techo buffs around, the Ultrawide at 21:9 and Super Ultrawide 32:9 ratios provide more on screen and give you a better view of the environments, and 3D audio, as long as you have the capabilities, will make Returnal on PC a must for fans of the science fiction genre.Level design is superb

Returnal,Mick Fraser,God is a Geek,https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/returnal-review/,"April 30, 2021You know every time you’ve played an indie game and thought, “Wow, I wonder what these folks could do with a triple-A budget…”? Well, Returnal is the answer to that question. It’s a hyperactive bullet hell shoot-em-up that’s also a third person Metroidvania that’s also a sci-fi roguelike action horror. It might also be the best game I’ve played this year.Now granted, there hasn’t been a huge amount of releases so far. In fact, you can probably count on one hand the number of triple-A games we’ve seen in the first quarter-and-a-bit of 2021, but something about Returnal tells me I’ll still be saying that by the end of the year.I admit that I went in not knowing what to expect. Sony haven’t done the best job explaining exactly what Returnal actually is. The trailers are cool, dark and moody, but they don’t convey just how atmospheric this game is from the moment you start. As I said in my preview, Returnal doesn’t mess around dropping you right into the action, and once you’re there, it simply doesn’t let up.For stoic protagonist Selene Vassos, the mission is simple. Or at least, it begins that way. See, Selene works for Astra, the mothership of a space exploration organisation with a definite whiff of Weyland-Yutani, right down to the retro-futuristic computers installed in Selene’s scoutship, the Helios. Her job is to travel to far off worlds and survey them, documenting flora, fauna, and, where possible, civilisation.Atropos is different, though. This overgrown, burned out husk of a world is host to what remains of an ancient civilisation referred to as the Sentients. Their bodies, mostly humanoid, litter Atropos, scattered like fallen ashes across the remnants of their once-mighty nations. After crashing her ship and barely surviving, Selene heads out hoping to find something that will help her repair the Helios and continue the mission – until she makes a grizzly discovery amidst the ruins and finds herself caught in a seemingly endless loop of survival, determination, and death. Each time she dies she relives the crash and must begin her exploration of Atropos anew. But this is not simply some time loop, for the corpses of her former attempts litter the world, alongside scout reports she can’t remember recording.I didn’t expect a lot from Returnal’s story. Roguelikes aren’t generally known for their plot lines, but like Hades, Returnal’s story feels constant. Each new Cycle rearranges the contents of Atropos’ varied Biomes, and so while it’s not procedurally generated, you’re never quite sure which configuration you’re going to find. The story weaves its way through and between these Cycles, presented in Selene’s audio logs and sometimes meandering thoughtlines, in short cutscenes and, most importantly, in a very specific area you’ll encounter multiple times in your playthrough. There’s more to the story than is immediately apparent, as elements of Selene’s past, and evidence of her determination, ambition, and grief are shown like smudges of light through warping glass.That said, of course, this is not a game built to tell a complex and involving story. There are few characters, and as with the Souls series, you’re left to piece together a lot of theories from tattered fragments of stimuli. The important thing here is exploration, and somehow Housemarque manage to maintain a fear of the unknown for the entire campaign. You always feel like you’re only seeing the edge of something, that there’s much more to this world happening in the distance, in ancient spires and forgotten ruins. You feel like an intruder, an interloper, and so you expect to be caught and punished at any moment. Even late in the game when you’ve unlocked a suite of gadgets and gizmos, you’ll rarely feel able to relax and let your guard down. It is a game that keeps on surprising you.Like many Roguelikes, Returnal spits you back out at the start once it’s finished chewing you up, and each Cycle begins with you waking up inside or outside the Helios. You can potter about in the ship, reviewing things you’ve discovered, or taking part in online challenge runs that serve as a way to practice your skills and test your mettle for valuable resources. And like many Metroidvanias, it periodically gifts you with a new tool for traversing the world, reaching new areas, or finding new weapons. For example, one alien device you find allows you to use the teleporters scattered around the place, either to open new rooms or to backtrack to old ones.You’ll retain only permanent upgrades to your suit, and specific devices you find such as the aforementioned translocator. All the weapons and items you discover are mixed into a pool of possible drops and rewards, like Dead Cells, which you may or may not encounter during a given Cycle. This includes guns and their various, randomised alternate fire modes, single use power-ups, and artefacts that grant permanent buffs for the duration of a run.Currency drops in the form of Oblites, a Xeno-type resource used at Fabricators to create items and artefacts, while many of the items you come across are Malignant and will cause temporary malfunctions to your suit until you satisfy certain conditions. Parasites you find offer a buff and debuff together, and you’ll often need to consider the trade-off. The likelihood is that you’ll rarely have two Cycles that play out the same way, especially as the enemy line-up alters each time, too.Combat here is a mix of third person strafe shooting and old school bullet hell. Enemies, including tentacled and bioluminescent alien monstrosities, lethal automatons, or the Sentients themselves, come in a variety of flavours, each packing a punch if you’re not sprightly on your toes. Selene can dash to avoid harm, using i-frames to negate damage completely if the timing is right, and return fire with weapons that feature secondary projectiles and alternate fire modes. It’s often frantic, with attacks coming from all sides from enemies that will shoot, claw, and charge you, that can trigger AoE bursts, use beam weapons, ground you in place or knock you on your arse. They can fly, sprint, dash, teleport and ground slam, and learning what each one does and the best way to take them down is half the challenge. You will die often, but you’ll learn something each time.If there’s one thing that felt just a little out of place in Returnal, it was the bosses. None of them feel like lords of their domain like they usually do in such games. They don’t feel intrinsic to the story or necessary for the Biomes to function as they do, and instead just feel like they exist because games like this need bosses. The fights are universally hard and universally well designed, and beating them will take determination and skill. They often reward a new permanent upgrade, so you’ll always feel like it was worth it, I’d just have liked some real lore about them in the game world. The runs back to them are rarely easy either, as they often require you to run through at least part of some of the previous Biomes, and rushing to them will leave you under-geared and facing an even steeper challenge.But I didn’t really mind having to run through Returnal’s Biomes over and over, because each one is either beautifully grim or hauntingly macabre. Ruins jut from the ground like broken teeth, wrapped with dark leaves or alien fauna that glows ominously as you approach. An ancient desert, vast and windblown, makes you feel insignificant with its magnitude. Citadels and towers and decaying fortresses stand like silent sentinels guarding the secrets of this desolate world. Housemarque have spared no expense with the world and level design, creating disparate Biomes that manage to feel like part of a greater whole.At the time of writing the only complaint isn’t entirely down to Housemarque: turning off the PS5 resets the Cycle, so if you need to stop halfway through a run, you must use the console’s rest function – something which repeatedly resulted in me losing progress when the function failed to work as intended. There’s really no reason whatsoever that you can’t just turn off and restart exactly where you were or even at the nearest teleporter, and it’s something I hope they patch later.That minor gripe aside, Returnal is an exceptional game. The fluid, graceful movement and satisfying, punchy gunplay combine with a sense of exploration at once both wondrous and morbid, and a drip-fed progression system that makes you feel like you’re always discovering or unlocking something new. Elements that should feel at odds with one another feel effortlessly cohesive thanks to Housemarque’s deft touch and singular vision. Returnal may not appeal to everyone given its relentlessly dark nature and unwavering difficulty, but it’s an absolute must-play for anyone who craves a genuine challenge.Looks amazing

Returnal,Josh Wise,VideoGamer,http://www.videogamer.com//reviews/returnal-review," Posted in Reviews
UPDATE February 2023: We’re republishing our review of Returnal for the game’s PC release this week. Bear in mind, this mainly covers the game as it stood at the PS5 launch in 2021 and doesn’t include post launch updates such as co-op. However, we still believe Josh’s review stands as an accurate evaluation of the base game.NOW READ:   Returnal PC System Requirements; minimum, recommended, and epicAt the start of Returnal, a spacefarer named Selene pilots her ship, the Helios, into a storm. She accelerates into a whirlpool of bruised cloud, and one of her engines is speared by a bolt of lightning—her wing aflame, she plummets to the forest below. Whether or not that is the start of Returnal is another matter. Like Phil Connors, the chronologically challenged hero of Groundhog Day, Selene is chained within a time loop. Whenever she dies, she wakes back at the crash site. Unlike Phil, she isn’t roused by the unceasing strains of Sonny & Cher; instead, her head swims with dreams of dark water, engirdling tentacles, and a white-clad astronaut whose chunky fashion hails from the Apollo era. Furthermore, Andie MacDowell is frankly nowhere to be seen; the only romance on offer is that between Selene and the planet on which she is marooned. Despite its vicious dangers, it won’t let her be defeated, and you can almost hear it crooning to her, after every failed battle: I got you, babe.The planet is called Atropos, and at this point any passing classicists will have broken into a soft purr. There is a dusting of Greek mythology to the story; “It’s impossible not to think of my books,” says Selene, describing the place and its teeming threats. “I hate to use the term, but it feels… ‘mythic.’” Indeed, the notion that the terrain itself should be named for one of the Fates (specifically, the one in charge of death—of snipping the mortal thread) might seem a little loaded. Then again, credit must go to the developer, Housemarque, for the sensible hedging of its bets. There is more than one set of myths being honoured here.Most of us, I would guess, when confronted with the sight of a woman in a form-fitting suit of armour, emerging from a shuttle into the rain, would think of Super Metroid and its heroine, Samus Aran. True enough, homage is paid with interest to Nintendo’s masterwork, and its sequel Metroid Prime. Note the ossified remains of an ancient race, which bestow a raft of gifts, and the map: a wraithlike holographic projection, whose chambers hiss with static. But the differences lie in the expression. Selene claws out of the wreckage of her ship (unlike Samus, who ascended gracefully from a ceiling hatch), and she is met with a particularly needling downpour. This you can feel in the controller, which uses haptic feedback to prick at your palms in concert with the audio, and the result is a deluge of feeling. Not only is Selene being drizzled on by the gods but we are right there in her plight—plugged into her helmet and rapped by the elements.Further sensations await in the judder and clack of the combat. There aren’t many games that one might recommend in lieu of a really good hand massage, but this does the job. Atropos is prowled by an array of creatures—robotic, organic, one sticky green brute appears to be broccoli-based. My favourite is the Kerberon, an unholy splicing of lion and octopus, with a feline pounce and a writhing mane; only, the real kick comes before you even see the beast. It emits a noise: a gluey string of glottal stops, like that which echoed through the jungles of Predator, unspooling from the mandibles of its villain. These creepy clicks rattle through your fingers, and you can’t help the overwhelming desire to shoot in their general direction.This is, of course, excellent news, given that Housemarque’s treatment of the shoot ’em up verges on the sacerdotal. The studio’s last game was Nex Machina (a delicious title, Latin for “death machine”), in 2017, for which Eugene Jarvis served as creative consultant. Scarcely a day goes by that I don’t think about that game, with its crumbling showers of voxels and its crisp bursts of laser, and there is much of its purity—and of Jarvis’s design approach, honed in games like Robotron: 2084 and Smash TV—in Returnal. Complex systems are made simple, by committing their clutter to muscle memory, and play—good play, at any rate—requires that you, like Selene, ride its enigmatic loop.You have, at your disposal, (a) an evasive dash, granting a brief grace period of invulnerability, (b) whichever weapon you happen to have found, and (c), providing you have had enough sleep—or, failing that, enough caffeine—your reflexes. On top of this fine foundation a slew of gizmos and buffs are layered. Highlights include a sabre, which springs from its hilt with a hot gleam and gives you a single, punctuating slash; and an energy-powered grappling hook, fired from the wrist, that whips you through environments as quick as the cord retractor on a vacuum cleaner. The shooting is one of those rare, near-nourishing pleasures—the kind that may keep Returnal fused to your hard drive, for those moments where you feel your mood dampen. You begin, near the Helios, with a pistol, and, if you are so inclined, you can end with one as well. I’ve always considered it the measurement of a developer, their treatment of the pistol. There are those that palm you off with all the firepower of a bowl of Rice Krispies, impatient to move up the food chain, to rifles and what have you, but the best give the handgun the weight of what it is: a death machine.There are other weapons, naturally—carbines, shotguns, etc, as well as farther-flung contraptions. One pelts vials of corrosive green gloop at your foes, another pins them with high-voltage pylons and fries them. All have a good dose of haptic kick, and the triggers have been vested with the requisite levels of ka-thunk. I’m also delighted to report that there is an active reload mechanic here; quite why developers have been so damn good-mannered about cribbing the best thing from Gears of War I have no clue. Pilfer away, I say. The real joy of the action, outside of its weaponry, is the process of encrusting Selene with upgrades. There are parasites, which resemble baby squid, that can be suckered to her arm, increasing her protection at the cost of a longer cooldown for her dash, say, or boosting her speed and damage output while making her vulnerable to long drops.There is a sense of swelling momentum in each run, a combination of accrued perks and warmed nerves. After three kills, you raise an adrenaline point, to a maximum of five, each level imparting boosts—for example, the ability to see your targets through walls. As soon as you are hit, your adrenaline resets. What a drag, you might think, but inside of a minute you are back on the hunt. As mechanics go, this one is like handing out a pamphlet on grieving; what a smart move for Housemarque to wrap the crux of its game around a microcosm of its defining feature.When I first heard that Returnal was a roguelike, I shuddered. It’s one of those genres that won’t seem to die. I can understand the appeal from a development standpoint; like the metroidvania, it provides a ready-carved set of rituals, into whose mould an imagination can be poured. Fair enough. But the downside is that, when playing one, I often think, Did this need to be a roguelike? Wouldn’t a checkpoint have been fine? With Returnal, however, Housemarque has opted for the only genre that would suit its subject matter. More than that, though, the pain of losing your progress speaks to something at the heart of the studio’s history. Where else was that sorrow more acute and crushing than the arcade, when the last of your money had been sucked into the slot, and the cabinet in front of you seemed, in some way, to die—its pleasures expired, its shell turned strangely impassive?As you begin again, you realise that progress is gained across and despite the temporal loop. There are new audio logs, to be found on fallen versions of Selene; she comments on the frazzled and increasingly unhinged tone of the woman on the other end, correcting her use of “I” to “she.” And the landscape rearranges itself for each attempt, renewing your sense of discovery and keeping you off-balance. At one point, I was trudging, deflated, through a clearing and was met with the most striking, surreal vision in games this year: amidst the steamy branches of an alien world, a twentieth-century house, covered in creepers, with a plain wooden porch and light leaking from an upstairs window.It should come as no surprise that the story, though among the stars, is tightly coiled around Selene’s past, and the far-off traumas of family. As is often the case in science fiction, blasting free of the solar system only has us venturing further inwards, to the constellations of our loved ones. Think of Matthew McConaughey, in Interstellar, bending into a black hole and winding up behind a bookcase at home, trying to communicate with his daughter. The details here are drip-fed through a series of first-person segments and abstract images: a failed NASA application, a news report telling of a car crash, a wrinkled hand enclosed within another. I will give little away, suffice to say that Housemarque, in its choice of genre and in the low orbit of the plot, has rummaged around in this galactically therapeutic trope and come up with fresh treasure. By the end, Selene may have ventured across deserts of rich Martian red, through wastes of ice and under dripping canopies, and she may fail, but she will always wake back where she began, pained but changed—another coin clattering into the slot.Developer: HousemarquePublisher: SonyAvailable on: PS5Release Date: April 30, 2021To check what a review score means from us, click here.

Returnal,Jeff Grubb,GamesBeat,https://venturebeat.com/2021/04/29/returnal-review-in-progress-like-beating-your-head-against-a-fun-wall/,"Connect with top gaming leaders in Los Angeles at GamesBeat Summit 2023 this May 22-23. Register here.The art of building a quality roguelite is in the sleight of hand. In order to finish the game, the player needs to improve their skill. But that is a tedious and laborious process. A good roguelite, however, distracts the player from this process. Instead, it puts the focus on smaller tasks to unlock new weapons or tools. The idea is that if only you can unlock that next weapon, maybe you’ll have what you need to progress — but in reality, you are actually learning the way the game works and getting better at playing it. Returnal’s biggest weakness is a dearth of compelling progressions to distract you from its learning curve, and that is detrimental to its pacing and sense of momentum.Returnal is the latest first-party PlayStation 5 release from Sony Interactive Entertainment. It’s a sci-fi action shooter from developer Housemarque, which is best known for arcade-style hits like Super Stardust HD and PS4 launch game Resogun. Returnal is available April 30 for $70.The best shorthand for Returnal is that it looks and feels like a $70 Housemarque game. That is to say that a lot of production work went into its presentation. Talented artists packed its world with powerful, alien geometry and atmosphere. And high-quality cinematics stitch together each run to really sell the Groundhog Day repetition.This presentation does have some minor rough edges. Animations are mostly solid, but your character can sometimes look awkward — like when she falls down a trap floor. Also, some enemies are less expressive, which can make it difficult to monitor when they will attack.GamesBeat Summit 2023Join the GamesBeat community in Los Angeles this May 22-23. You’ll hear from the brightest minds within the gaming industry to share their updates on the latest developments.The visuals can also feel cluttered. Occasionally, an enemy will glow the same color as your heads-up display, which can make reading the important info on your reticle nearly impossible.The presentation mostly works, and the Prometheus vibes will win over fans of spooky, slimy sci-fi. But while Housemarque has shifted away toward more narrative and higher production values, this is still one of those games.Returnal is a twitchy shooter with a dash mechanic to ensure you can avoid the bullet-hell attacks from glowy aliens. When you aren’t dashing, you can sprint and fire your weapon, which has an alt-fire. When you get in close, you can use a melee attack.The particulars don’t matter. This is a game that usually feels good to play. Learning new enemies and how to avoid their attacks and when to counter is fun — especially when the moving and the stinging is as solid as it is here.I did find myself getting frustrated in key moments, though.Due to those aforementioned cluttered visuals, I found myself jumping into water before I could survive it. I still struggle to tell when I’m looking at water in this game. Also, the action often happens above the horizon line, which means you’re likely going to aim the behind-the-back camera at an upward angle. This led me to fall into a gaps in the ground that I did not see at least 10 times. Because you need precise aiming, so you cannot keep the camera pointed at the ground, I think the pits are a mistake that only make the game worse.And then there’s the controller gimmicks. To aim down sight in Returnal, you need to pull the L2 button down half way. Thanks to the adaptive triggers, you can feel a pressure push back to stop you from going too far. If you pull past that point, you’ll prime your alt-fire. While this is a neat way to show off the technology, I don’t really like it. I’m pretty used to it now, but I still hate feeling like I need to feather a button to avoid accidentally blowing my crucial special move. This is especially annoying when the controller has unused buttons that could’ve served this purpose.You can turn off this adaptive-triggering mechanic, and I would recommend it. Having this on L1 instead provides a lot more control.Up to this point I would say that Returnal is a very good game. I like its look and feel despite some quirks. But the game does have some serious flaws in its structure.Like other roguelites, Returnal is a game where you start over from the beginning when you die. At first glance, that can seem like a terrible idea, but it’s actually something that tickles a certain part of our psyches. Humans love tackling obstacles that they have a deep understanding of. And playing the same rooms and fighting the same enemies repeatedly (stitched together differently each run) is a great way of enabling the player to build that kind of knowledge.But Returnal doesn’t give the player a lot to do while you struggle to get over that understanding gap. You have some persistent items, like the ether currency. And you can find items that you will permanently unlock in the world. But I’ve rarely engaged with that mechanic, so it has not served as a motivation to keep me going.So what ends up happening is that every run feels like you are laser-focused on beating the game alone. And that means my primary concern through every run was getting a strong, survivable build. Getting a build like that, however, is very dependent on the world you roll. Are you going to find enough items to improve the weapons you find in the world? Maybe. Will the health items increase your max HP or just replenish it? Hopefully it leans toward the former.If the procedural generation kinda stinks on a run, it almost always feels like a waste of time. Because again, you’re not really working toward smaller goals. Maybe if you’re lucky, you’ll learn something new, but again, that can feel tedious.The worst aspect of this gameplay loop is that whether you have a good build or a bad build, they all pretty much feel the same. A strong build will have a lot of HP, strong resistance to damage, and a powerful gun, and a bad build won’t have those things. But all builds still have you shooting and striking and dodging in the mostly the same way. Maybe you’ll stumble upon a synergy where your melee does more damage and reduces the cooldown on your alt-fire, but that is rare. And again, it still doesn’t actually feel different.This lack of variety in the style of play makes every run feel samey, and they begin to blur together. That leads to a rote feeling that made me want to put down the game when I was struggling with the difficulty. I like challenging games, but roguelites need to walk a fine line between familiarity and routine. Familiarity is the warm embrace of something that feels like home. Routine is boredom, and it is poison for a game like this.My low point with Returnal came as I was struggling to get through the second biome. The monotony of the runs was getting to me, and I would’ve put the game down if I wasn’t reviewing it. Eventually, I did get a strong build from the first biome, and that made the second level much easier. The build was so strong that I was able to beat the second level’s boss on my first attempt. And yet, if I were to tell you what makes this set of equipment special, I would say that the gun does a lot of damage and my defense is really strong.Now, I did make the decisions along the way to get those traits, but this is how you talk about gear in a looter shooter. But it’s completely forgettable in this context — beyond recognizing that doing a lot of damage and being able to take a lot of damage makes the game easier. I now plan replicate this build on every run, and if the world doesn’t give me the necessary gear to do that, I’m going to feel like it’s wasting my time again.This is not a fatal flaw. But it is one that I think turns significant chunks of Returnal into a slog. And that reduces what is otherwise a great game into one that I merely like.Returnal is available April 30 for $70 exclusively on PlayStation 5.

Returnal,Jon Bailes,"Rock, Paper, Shotgun",https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/returnal-review,"Let’s go round againThe last thing you need when you’ve just crash-landed on an unknown planet teeming with predatory wildlife is to discover you’re also stuck in a time loop. But that’s the fate of deep-space astronaut Selene in Returnal, when she ditches her single-seater vessel on a remote rock called Atropos. Each time she falls foul of the local fauna, she pops back into existence right next to her broken ship, with no obvious means of escape. Forget Aliens vs Predator, this is Aliens vs Groundhog Day.But what a day it is, as Returnal combines a best-in-class third-person shooter with a deep dive into the psychology of its protagonist. Selene’s journey into Atropos, through a thick jungle, a burning vermilion desert and beyond, sends her circling through a smorgasbord of emotions – from confusion to hope, despair to determination. And so often, her mood dovetails with your own highs and lows of elation and frustration, until every part of Returnal encases you in its loop.Indeed, for the last two years, this Sony published title has been one of the best reasons to own a PlayStation 5. It may not have the glamourous reputation of mega-franchise sequels such as Horizon: Forbidden West or God of War: Ragnarök, but Returnal is as much a showcase for the platform as any of them, and utterly essential as long as you don’t mind its rather punishing challenge. Not to mention that since its release Finnish developer Housemarque has addressed early criticisms and planed away rough edges, until the loop runs smoother than ever.It's gratifying to find, then, that Climax Studios’ PC port is no less essential. At least that is as long as you have a machine with enough grunt to keep up with its luminescent mayhem. I have to admit, I fell a little short in this respect, equipped with a PC that merely matched the recommended settings, and it came as no surprise that I had to tune the graphical bells and whistles down a notch to maintain a solid frame rate. That’s fine, but if you have to venture further down the scale into the ‘Medium’ settings, the drop in quality is steep, and the lively environments lose a lot of their shine. While I’m usually no stickler for performance or fidelity, Returnal’s alien textures and eye-scorching particles deserve to have the dials turned up to max.The good news is that when it’s running on ‘Epic’ settings, this version is as sumptuous as the original. Battles are a feast of searing lasers, missile swarms and writhing tentacles. Statues explode into hundreds of tiny rocks, enemies dissolve into piles of cascading voxels, and teleporters deconstruct Selene into swirls of light before cannoning her across the world. Combined with the rumble of a control pad and the retro sci-fi vibe of the 3D soundscape, it’s a feast for the senses. Well, three of them.In amongst all that, the controls and the camera are ever-reliable, somehow never intruding on the illusion. Returnal is one of those rare games where everything just works. You can see what you need to see. Every twitch of the thumb to prompt Selene to run, jump, and dash is obeyed with life-or-death urgency. The grappling wire upgrade you secure partway through propels you across arenas with zero fuss. Sprint towards a health pickup, and you know you can grab it without breaking stride.Even after dozens of hours on the PS5 version and a good number on this one, I’m still amazed how Housemarque has managed to translate its mastery of 2D arcade action in titles such as Resogun and Nex Machina into three dimensions so fluidly. The result is a kind of behind-the-shoulder bullet hell, where you step and weave between sheets of glowing death orbs like a gun-toting Muhammad Ali. Alternatively, you can duck out of sight until the heat dies down, but it’s all part of the flow. Cover spots in Returnal aren’t the sore-thumb low walls of many a third-person shooter, but organic pillars of rock or blocks of debris that suddenly become useful in a pinch.
Still, this is a tough game, especially in its first half. In the early stages, it’s tempting to hunker down behind doorways to its randomly arranged rooms, picking off individual enemies, and probably a wise idea until you learn how each type behaves. But Selene is built to win battles by staying on the move, shooting from the hip, closing down turrets to take them out with a swing of her blade, scaling the vertical space to find a vantage point. Charge into the fray and you may bite off more than you can chew, but there’s little to match the exhilaration when the noise stops and you’re the only one still moving.While the action alone already makes Returnal special, though, what makes it very special indeed is the atmosphere and narrative that wind around it. Selene is a compelling character to accompany as her logic-hungry personality chafes against her predicament (also thanks to Jane Perry’s voice work). Her fear is palpable when she stumbles upon corpses of other versions of herself, clutching recordings describing journeys she can’t remember. She’s even more befuddled when she discovers a replica of her old house deep in the jungle, with memories inside that suggest new theories, or maybe a descent into madness.But more than that, with all the clues, names and symbols that enrich the ambiguous fiction, Returnal drags you by the hand through the sheer terror of the time loop scenario. However exciting it is to tackle the challenges of Atropos, at the same time every loop is like entering another ring of hell, as the realisation dawns that the joy of shooting stuff is the only distraction from a seamless, suffocating, circular reality.In fact, I’d go as far as to say that some of the content added to Returnal since its initial release, which is all present here, threatens to detract from that illusion. Pausing to call in a co-op buddy or suspending a game mid-run can’t but rub against the idea that you’re trapped alone and forever in a hostile world. Not that these aren’t welcome options, though, particularly for anyone who doesn’t feel like taking Atropos on at its most uncompromising.Plus the extras also include the fantastic Tower of Sisyphus, a new ‘endless’ game mode which opens up once you’ve made significant progress along the main path. While Returnal has roguelike elements, including randomised maps and items that throw up little risk-reward choices, the tower is a much more focused roguelike experience, right down to its scoring system and online leaderboard. If there was any doubt before that the game offered enough incentive to continue playing once its story was done, the tower more than plugs the gap.And with that, Returnal’s circle is complete. Keep playing and each turn reveals with increasing certainty that this is a game totally at one with itself, from its audio-visual spectacle to its pinpoint control to its interweaving narrative and now its longevity. Unlike Selene, I keep coming back to Atropos by choice. Long may its immaculate, horrifying loop continue.You're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!

The game adds a wonderful breath of fresh air to Sony’s exclusive lineup, which has recently come under fire for lacking diversity.On the surface, Returnal may look like another third-person action game with the PlayStation Studios splash screen attached However, nothing could be further from the truth. Returnal is a bold step forward for developer Housemarque, proving that the studio is one of the finest working teams in the industry. Returnal takes huge risks frequently. Remarkably, almost all of them pay off. No other publisher is putting out big-budget titles as risky as this rogue-lite. If you own a PS5, then Returnal is absolutely essential.Returnal’s premise hooks you right from the start. You’re immediately thrown into the boots of astronaut Selene, who has just crash-landed on the hostile alien planet of Atropos. After a brief scripted opening, Selene finds herself trapped in a time loop. Every time she dies, she returns to the wreckage of her crashed spaceship and must once again venture out from there to unravel the mystery of Atropos. She must also discover why she has become trapped in this never-ending cycle. The story unfolds mostly through audio logs that you pick up from previously fallen versions of Selene herself. These logs are randomly generated, which results in the story feeling a tad fragmented. However, even with the narrative being doled out in small snippets, the central yarn is surprisingly gripping. There are some surreal cutscenes thrown into the mix. You’ll also get to unravel more story through first-person sections set within a creepy 20th-century house from Selene’s past, which has inexplicably appeared on the alien world’s surface. These segments are pretty bizarre, and even get a little meta. But they’re a great change of pace and frequently feel unnerving. The story definitely takes a backseat to the gameplay in Returnal, but the narrative does come to a satisfactory, if slightly rushed, conclusion. There’s also a secret ""true"" ending tied to a set of post-game collectibles, which could fill in the few remaining blanks. Returnal is the logical evolution of Housemarque’s previous critically acclaimed games like Resogun and Dead Nation. It takes the excellent bullet-hell shooting of those titles and bumps the production values up several notches. You’ll primarily spend your time running, jumping and dashing around enemies while avoiding waves of brightly colored projectiles. As you do so, Platforming sections break up the tense combat encounters. While the jumps feel a tad floaty, making precise landing tricky, these sections offer some needed variety, as well as time to allow your heart rate to return to normal. As mentioned Returnal is a rogue-lite, and a pretty unforgiving one at that. This means that upon every death, you return to the scene of the crash, without any of your previously collected weapons, upgrades, and items. You begin with almost nothing, save for a basic pistol, and each death returns you to that state. Some games in this genre, such as Dead Cells and Hades, are reasonably generous, giving players a range of upgrades that persist across runs. In Returnal, though, very little carries over. Traversal abilities that unlock during key story moments remain, as does a type of currency called Ether. You can also keep a few specific weapon upgrades, which you earn through long-term use. Otherwise, you lose it all. Furthermore, there are no save rooms or ways to pause your progress. If you switch the game off mid-run, you lose everything and start back up at the crash site. You can use the PS5’s rest mode feature to suspend the game, but it’s an inelegant solution. The game badly needs a ""save and exit"" function. This would prevent players from cheating death with frequent saves, while still making the game more accessible to people who can’t play for hours at a time.  There are a lot of interlocking systems at play in Returnal. There are two currency types: Ether, as described above, and Oblities, which don’t carry over across runs. There are also various types of pickups, such as Parasites. These are little creatures that attach to your body and offer a positive upgrade, as well as a negative effect. You can remove Parasites only by completing a randomly generated task, such as killing a set number of enemies or picking up large quantities of Oblities.There are also Artifacts and Malignant Chests, either of which can infect you with a negative malfunction. You can cleanse these items with your precious stock of Ether. Then there are gameplay systems such as overloading, which is similar to active reloading in Gears of War, and Adrenaline, which rewards you with upgrades for every three enemies you kill without taking damage. If it all sounds like a lot to take in, that’s because it is. Unfortunately Returnal doesn’t do a great job of slowly introducing you to each system. Instead, it throws all of them at you right from the start. Returnal's first few hours feel overwhelming. Every few minutes, you’ll try to get your head around a new wrinkle or type of upgrade.The game's six unique biomes are procedurally generated as well. Each feels distinct, save for one in the back half of the game that seems like a palette swap. The randomness helps to make every run feel unique. While you’ll quickly start to recognize individual rooms, enemy placement is usually different. Well-placed checkpoints and shortcuts minimize the need to endlessly repeat previous biomes, but some areas do get repetitive. Returnal warns players from the start that it’s designed to be a challenging experience, but it starts off fairly easy. In fact, my first death didn’t come until the third boss fight. However, the second half of the game ramps up the challenge significantly. While it never approaches the brutality of a Souls game, Returnal has a pleasant difficulty curve. I always felt apprehensive about what terrifying beast was lurking in the next dark corner. I always felt apprehensive about what terrifying beast was lurking in the next dark corner.How long it takes you to reach the ending will be highly dependent on your skill. I managed to fight my way through to the game’s final boss within 15 hours, which felt a little on the short side. However, the unpredictable nature of each new run and the additional post-game collectibles are giving me plenty of reasons to return.   Overall, Returnal's structure and engaging risk-reward balance made just about every minute of play a joy. I had one particularly crushing defeat, in which I fell to a mini-boss with just a sliver of health left, after two-and-half hours of slowly crawling through one of the game’s toughest biomes. My reaction was momentary frustration, followed by immediate determination to return to that enemy and enact my revenge. And trust me, the mini-boss felt my fury (after it killed me a second time, that is). Returnal is a true showcase of the PS5's capabilities. The game is graphically stunning. From the incredible environmental design, to small details like fauna swaying in the breeze, or the movement of an enemy’s grotesque tentacles,  it all looks marvelous. A PS4 couldn’t dream of running this. Remarkably, the game sticks to a smooth 60 frames-per-second frame rate without any noticeable hiccups. This is absolutely essential for the bullet-hell nature of battles, where perfect timing is the difference between dodging an attack and losing a massive chunk of your precious health. The sound design is also extremely impactful. Returnal proves that 3D Audio isn’t just a marketing gimmick. Walking into an unexplored area and hearing a bloodcurdling scream behind you from a new type of monster never gets old. You need to play Returnal with a decent headset, or a proper surround sound system. Audio design this good isn’t meant for lackluster television speakers. On a technical level, the game is impressive as well. I experienced no major bugs or glitches, beyond a couple of forgivable clipping issues with some of the larger enemies. One promising run ended in a hard crash, however. This was pretty frustrating, considering the lack of mid-run save points. Unfortunately, post-release Returnal has proved to be a lot less stable from a technical perspective. After various reports of crashing and save files corrupting (which I experienced myself after posting this review) in the days after launch, Housemarque promised a patch to address these problems. This patch ended up creating more issues than it solved, and it led to the game becoming downright unplayable for some users. Even requiring a complete redownloading of the game after file corruption in some cases. This game-breaking patch was pulled and a new update has now been pushed out, but it further highlights the desperate need for some form of manual save system to allow users to restore progress in the event of a glitch or game crash. It’s almost impossible to talk about Returnal without mentioning its implementation of the unique features of the PS5’s DualSense controller. These increase the sense of immersion tenfold. The DualSense uses haptic feedback to simulate everything from the pitter-patter of raindrops on your metallic helmet, to the buzz of your weapon being ready to blast off a powerful shot. Every gun has an alternative-fire mode, which charges up slowly over time. To switch between fire modes, you don’t hold down a button or toggle a setting. Instead, you select which type of round to fire off by how far you depress the left trigger. The DualSense’s Adaptive Triggers create a shooting system that a player needs to experience to fully appreciate. Returnal is the best implementation of the DualSense's features since Astro’s Playroom. It’s also worth noting that thanks to the PS5’s speedy SSD, load times in Returnal basically don’t exist. Fast travel is essentially instantaneous, and also features a particle effect that is downright jaw-dropping. Returnal is a system-seller in its own right. While many of the game's best ideas come from other rogue-lites, Housemarque has blended together all of these different elements into one uniquely satisfying package.This remarkable game feels completely original in the big-budget gaming space, which often feels frustratingly risk-averse. Returnal stands shoulder-to-shoulder with beloved PlayStation exclusives like God of War and Ghost of Tsushima, and is the first must-play title of the new console generation. Rory is a Deals Editor at Tom’s Guide based in the UK.

Returnal,Chad Sapieha,Post Arcade (National Post),http://business.financialpost.com/technology/gaming/returnal-review-live-die-repeat," Housemarque's PlayStation 5 exclusive is a punishingly tough roguelike shooter with great action — assuming you don't mind diving into bullet hell Score: 7.5/10  Platform: PlayStation 5Developer: Housemarque Publisher: SIE Release Date: April 30, 2021 ESRB: TSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.Subscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.Create an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.Don't have an account?  Create Account Quick history lesson: A little over four decades ago a computer game called Rogue gave birth to an entire subgenre of games dubbed — wait for it — roguelikes. Roguelikes attempt to emulate, to some degree, the defining characteristics of their namesake, the most vital of which are procedurally generated maps and permadeath. For any non-nerds who may be reading, that just means that each time your character dies you lose pretty much all of your progress and are respawned into a new world that has been randomly assembled by an algorithm.Fast forward to today. The indie game world has become dense with roguelikes, including last year’s smash hit Hades, which has been cleaning up on the awards circuit over the last few months. However, roguelike design hasn’t quite caught on in the mainstream, perhaps because such games tend to be punishingly difficult and rely on the player having a certain amount of tenacity to keep playing even after losing all (or at least most) of their progress over and over again.Sign up to receive the daily top stories from the Financial Post, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.A welcome email is on its way. If you don't see it, please check your junk folder.The next issue of Financial Post Top Stories will soon be in your inbox. We encountered an issue signing you up. Please try again But that hasn’t stopped a few big studios and publishers from giving roguelikes a go.The latest foray onto this particularly sadistic branch of the interactive entertainment tree comes in the form of Returnal, a PlayStation 5 exclusive published by Sony and developed by Finnish studio Housemarque. It is, on the surface, a sci-fi survival horror shooter. An astronaut named Seline has crash landed on a mysterious world full of crumbling ruins inhabited by an extremely aggressive alien presence. To survive and find a means of escape she must venture out into the terrors of the night.But things take a twist when she dies — which happens often, thanks to the inhuman ferocity and doggedness of the creatures inhabiting this world. Each time Seline gets killed she is zapped back somewhere in or around her ship, where she wakes up stripped of pretty much all loot and any progress she may have made. Stranger still, the world itself gets rearranged, with rooms and environments jumbled up in new ways.However, the creepiest part is that sometimes she stumbles across her old corpses and finds personal logs of experiences that haven’t even happened to her yet. And, given that her ship is still broken, she has no choice but to head out and do it all over again, hoping to live long enough to learn a little bit more about the nightmare world in which she finds herself.To be fair, we aren’t stripped of all progress when she dies. Yes, she loses whatever gun she has, along with all earned weapon proficiency (a stat that gradually grows to make her a more formidable fighter), and sure, she loses most of the items she’s collected as well as any of the handy parasitic organisms she’s encountered that confer little boosts to things like recovery and damage rates. But she also finds the occasional permanent upgrade, such as a sword that can cut through red energy barriers to reveal secrets. A key resource called ether (used to unlock stuff) stays with her after death, too.The most important thing we keep, though, is knowledge. Each trip teaches us more about this world via alien glyphs, gives us more experience with enemies so that we can affect new strategies, makes us more familiar with the various rooms and areas that get reshuffled after each death, and provides additional glimpses into the game’s purposefully byzantine mechanics, the riddling out of which is meant to be part of the game’s fun.Telling a compelling story in such a strange setting can’t be easy, but Housemarque’s writers have managed well enough. We are provided objectives each time we venture out — beating a specific boss, finding a location — and the reward for accomplishing them is typically a tantalizing bit of exposition that sheds additional light on the alien world, its long gone people, and even Seline herself. It’s just enough to feel satisfying while whetting the player’s appetite for more.Of course, to get more story you need to be willing to go out and do some more dying. A lot more. And to make such a challenging and repetitive experience palatable, the moment-to-moment gunplay needs to be great. Returnal‘s sci-fi weapons — which grow in strength and have a variety of alternate firing modes — feel tight and powerful, and the interface team has done some neat stuff with Sony’s PlayStation DualSense controller, making good use of its two-stage triggers, haptic feedback, and built-in speaker. Plus, Selene’s jogging speed and dash moves are extremely quick, which is vital for avoiding enemy fire and reducing the time spent trudging and backtracking through familiar rooms. She’s undeniably tough, and I’ve enjoyed the time I’ve spent in her boots.That said, I’m not a big fan of Returnal‘s “bullet hell” enemy attacks. In the gaming world, bullet hell refers to enemies that spam enormous waves of bullets in complex patterns. If you don’t keep moving through the maze, you’re dead. The inclusion of a bullet hell element oughtn’t be a complete surprise, given Housemarque’s history with top-down shooters like Super Stardust HD, but it is a bit of a polarizing game mechanic. And I find this three dimensional version comes with the added difficulty of accurately judging depth and distance between incoming balls. Staying alive amid a veritable shower of glowing death balls ain’t easy.I’ve managed to deal with Returnal’s bullet hell shtick even if I haven’t come to love it, mostly because I’m fascinated by the game’s world, atmosphere, and story. Plus, I really dig Seline. Her determination to not give up and keep pushing further into this planet of horrors in hopes of finding her way to the other side has made her one of my favourite new game heroes in recent memory. I need to know how her story ends.I don’t see Returnal becoming another Uncharted-style mega-franchise for Sony. It’s just too punishing and quirky to nab a massive audience. That said, it’s a well-produced and polished play that doesn’t really feel like anything else out there at the moment. If you’re not afraid of a challenge, it may be worth adding to your PlayStation playlist.

Returnal,Abdul Saad,GamingTrend,https://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/returnal-pc-review-restarting-the-cycle/,"Returnal is a fast-paced third-person shooter roguelike from developer Housemarque. The game was released exclusively for the PS5 almost two years ago to both critical and commercial success despite its challenging gameplay and steep learning curve. However, it is now finally releasing on PC with a slew of new exclusive features and options. Having spent several hours in the game on PC, I can confidently say that despite its difficulty and some frustrating elements, it is still one of the most fun games I’ve played in a while, and the PC port is Sony’s best port yet.For those unfamiliar with Returnal, the game follows ASTRA Corporation astronaut Selene Vassos who decides to visit the forbidden planet of Atropos to pursue the mysterious “White Shadow ” signal. However, upon crash landing on the planet, she finds corpses of herself and discovers that she revives with each death and that the planet and its creatures shift and change in the process, leading to a disturbing endless cycle of death and rebirth that presents new challenges and mysteries to unravel.Returnal’s plot is one that I find incredibly interesting and is one of the many elements that attracted me to the game. It does a great job of presenting an intriguing psychological horror mystery that slowly unravels with each major and minor progress. While players will start out knowing very little about Selene’s circumstances, this changes as they slowly begin to learn more about her history, the origins of the mysterious planet, and the reason for the horrific cycle with each victory in combat.Speaking of combat, Returnal’s gameplay is nothing short of impeccable. I’m a huge fan of fast-paced gameplay in any medium, and Returnal does a great job of scratching that itch. Guns feel weighty and accurate, movement is swift but precise, and enemies are unique and unpredictable. Players can jump and dash across high distances and use a variety of guns, explosives, upgrades, restorative items, and more. So in terms of pure action, Returnal is one of the best games I’ve played in recent years. However, there will always be bad with the good, and that remains true for Returnal. While the game is skill-based, it is unfortunately just as luck-based as well due to its roguelike elements. The problem with this is that, regardless of their skill, some players will find it difficult to progress without the necessary luck needed to find good weapons, upgrades, and items. As a result, you may find yourself blazing through the game in some runs while struggling in others.What’s more, I found the weapon variety to be very lacking, especially earlier in the game, as you’re only given a selection of three weapons with varying stats to choose from until you progress to other biomes. My biggest gripe with gameplay is the penalty system. Not only will good items be rare to come by sometimes, but you will also be faced with multiple “malignant” items which curse you with several types of debuffs, like reduced damage and healing, until you clear a bunch of different objectives. While there are ways to avoid dealing with the system, I still find that it adds an unnecessary level of tedium to the game.However, I will admit that despite its challenges, Returnal is still an incredibly fun, satisfying, and addictive game, especially once you learn the game’s ins and outs and once your luck hopefully begins to pick up. The experience is also significantly amplified when playing with a friend as the challenge is halved, and the fun is doubled.Now for the meat and potatoes of the PC version, I have to say that Returnal has the best port I’ve played thus far. The port gives players a slew of features, options, and toggles, including 4K support, Ultra and Super Ultra-wide support, 3D audio, Nvidia DLSS, Ray Tracing, several lighting, shadow, and FOV settings, and so much more. It also provides a neat benchmark feature that tests your PC against a mock level with enemies and a dynamic environment while displaying your CPU, RAM, and GPU usage before you even start the game, which I still find really cool.Despite its odd warnings of playing it on low settings, I was able to run the game on a measly RTX 3060 averaging about 60 FPS on High settings with no issues despite some frame rate dips during some intense moments with enemies, which I blame on the limitations of my own graphics card and not the game. I say this confidently because Ron, our Editor-in-chief, ran the game in 4K on a 4090 with all the works and no issues.
Overall, despite its frustrating and challenging elements, Returnal is an incredible game, especially on PC, as it provides even more neat ways to enjoy its immersive, challenging and satisfying experience.Returnal is a great game on console and on PC, and its brilliant fast-paced gameplay will give daring players a highly entertaining experience despite its frustrating elements.

Returnal,David Burdette,GamingTrend,https://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/aaa-liens-returnal-review/,"It’s really hard to make something unique in the gaming world today. Most genres have been explored, and while we sometimes get new takes (games like PUBG and The Binding of Isaac come to mind), for the most part we see familiar ideas based around what we already know. For every Call Of Duty there’s a Battlefield, for every Gran Turismo there’s a Forza Motorsports. That’s not to say they can’t be good, and the aforementioned games have done a great job of perfecting their genres, but fresh takes can be few and far between. Every once in a while, however, we come to something like Returnal, the latest game from Housemarque, which has taken several different genres and ideas and mashed them together to create something that feels so familiar, but still manages to find a way to be unique and satisfying.Let’s start right at the beginning shall we? You play as Selene, a space scout sent to investigate a mysterious signal on the planet Atropos. During your descent, something goes terribly wrong as your engine is hit by a lightning strike and you crash land on the planet below. What follows is truly disturbing as while searching for this signal you come upon a dead body. That may not seem so bad, but upon further investigation you find out it’s… you. Not only that, when you die you don’t really die, you return to that crash, just without all the stuff you collected along the way. Now, let me set this straight, as much as parts of the narrative may look and seem like horror, Returnal falls more into the thriller category. There are moments, like the first person jaunts through your house that has somehow made its way to an alien planet that are quite unnerving, but I haven’t come across anything that could even qualify as a jump scare.That’s not to say the atmosphere isn’t creepy, it just doesn’t fall into scary. What Returnal does manage to accomplish however is a general feeling of uneasiness. What’s around the next corner? What creatures may be waiting to tear my head off in the next area? Given Selene is just a puny human, especially at the start, the way Returnal takes the roguelike formula and adds in eerie space vibes (that background music tho) instantly establishes the tone.Speaking of roguelikes, many may find Returnal a bit difficult, at least at the beginning. This game is following the genre to a tee, if you die you go back to the opening area (a great way to mesh the genre with the narrative), with very little to show for the time you invested into your run. This is par for the course, but some will find Returnal’s arduous nature to be a product of just being hard rather than the type of game it is. I prefer to look at it this way: Returnal has a steep learning curve like a Dark Souls game.Here’s why I can make that claim. I played for about four or so hours in the first biome, just trying to brute force my way through the boss but to no avail. Upon taking the time to learn the systems in play, the weapons, the upgrades, doing all the side things I could, I managed to finally take that first boss, a grotesque beast named Phrike, down. Was it an intense fight? Absolutely, and bosses in games should be that way. But were my first few hours with Returnal overwhelmingly difficult due to design? Nope, it was simply my inexperience with playing a roguelike. Humble brag, I actually took out the second boss, Ixion, in one go because I understood the mechanics much more at that point. Returnal is tough, no doubt, but taking the time to learn how to play it lessens the blow immensely.That being said, one of the reasons I kept on going despite sucking horribly at Returnal at the beginning is because of the impressively strong gameplay loop. We have a lot to talk about when it comes to weaponry, upgrades, and the like, but to sum up the basic gameplay, it works in an extremely fluid manner. Many reviews are probably going to bring up Control as a comparison (and many previews already have), and rightly so. All of Selene’s movements are crisp; dashing, running, and jumping her way around each area very deftly. This makes its way into the gunplay as well, with every shot feeling precise and functioning as it should. It’s tough to describe just how much of a joy it is to play Returnal from a sheer gameplay standpoint, but even if this game was only “shoot bugs, move to the next location” I’d be fine with that.Part of that is due to the astounding manner in which Housemarque has adapted something they know so well into a third-person action game. For those who don’t know it, Housemarque is most well known for its bullet-hell top down shooters, and somehow they manage to meld this into Returnals core. When you fight enemies, huge rows of projectiles spew from them, causing you to have to dart around the battlefield while assaulting these foes. The emphasis on making these “hurt balls” colorful makes them easy enough to plan your movement, and it makes for plenty of fireworks on the screen. Taking on the bosses however are where it all ramps up, as it will seem like billions of these are hunting you down, and the sheer spectacle of it all makes for some of the best boss fighting I’ve had in a long time.I want to call attention to the third boss fight in particular, which is a phenomenal feat of level crafting. If you couldn’t tell, I’m a sucker for good boss fights, and Returnal has plenty of those. Just like a Souls title, these bosses give you that dopamine rush when you finish them off, and that speaks to a well-designed game.This had to be challenging for Housemarque to build given they have no history making this kind of game, but the talent involved in crafting these levels is bewildering. True, this isn’t a huge open world like Horizon Zero Dawn, and the set pieces can blend together in places, but the procedural way in which the areas arrange themselves with each new playthrough is awesome. I have yet to encounter the same layout in a run again, with the exception of restarting my game in order to stream the first levels. This works well with how much there is to do in each biome, and players are going to find plenty of side things to keep them busy. I didn’t even touch them before, but there are triangular doors on the mini-map (which itself is incredibly detailed) which will indicate a side path. Take them, you’ll almost always find something worth it, and it’s a good way to grind up to take on your next opponent.The design of the game does lean well into what roguelike genres tend to gravitate towards with procedural levels like Dead Cells, and you’ll also have plenty of things to lose when you make a wrong move. Just like any roguelike game, death resets you, with the exception of a few things. With Returnal, you’re going to keep any major story items like the melee “katana”, as well as Ether (which is an important resource to spend). Beyond that you are largely back to square one, with health, weaponry, artifacts, and upgrades all lost. There are ways to cheat the cycle, but those are ones you’ll have to find out on your own, and they are just temporary. Roguelikes don’t like to make it easy on you, every extra chance you find will cost you and there aren’t many available.What is available on your runs is surprisingly in depth, with plenty of systems and upgrades to learn as you go on your way. I do suggest taking your time here, as my doing so would’ve saved me a lot of annoyance in the early hours of the game. Your weapons are pretty standard, with pistols, rifles, launchers, and shotguns that will keep hostiles at bay, but it’s best to think carefully about what you’re using. Sometimes a level 9 rifle will work out better than a level 10 shotgun because your health is low and you need to keep a distance. While not every area will let you in without locking down, I’ve walked in and ran back out because I knew a certain creature was about to spawn and I’d left a more suitable weapon behind. This is a roguelike, so backtracking is your best friend. You’re also going to want to figure out what alt-fire works best, as a shockwave is just fine on a little enemy, but a homing missile could be great against another. This also works its way into passive effects which you earn as you use a gun, which again means to take your time and grind it up. It doesn’t take long, and having a launcher leave a poisonous trail can be useful.Other things you’re going to find include obolites (which is the currency to buy upgrades), keys to unlock doors and chests, artifacts that can grant bonuses like getting a temporary shield when you pick up resin, the aforementioned silphium resin which, depending on the type, can heal you or be collected to add to your max health bar, consumables that can give different boosts like health or alt-fire cooldown reductions, and more. There is also a poison that infects some of these called malignancy, and you have to gauge whether or not you want to chance opening some chests or picking up some items because of the negative effect that may befall you. For instance, I once took a chance picking up some infected resin, and while I received the additional health, I also would take more damage when I fell. Yes, I could clear it by opening a chest, but I’d have to find one and you never know how long that might take. None of these effects are too terrible, but allowing one at the wrong time could mean life or returning to the start with nothing.This also finds its way into the parasite system, and while I generally prefer not to chance it this is an interesting addition. You can pick up these little creatures which can grant bonuses, like obolites lasting longer when they drop, but in return your melee damage is sliced in half. Risk and reward is a huge part of Returnal, and roguelikes in general, so you’re going to have plenty of moments where you have to decide what’s worth it and what isn’t.All of these things together build into an extraordinarily complete package. One of the big questions for Returnal has always been the length, given Housemarque has mostly smaller titles on it’s resume. Everyone is going to have an opinion on what constitutes satisfying, but the way Returnal plays will be different for everyone. Experienced players with a bit of RNG luck may get through this one pretty quickly, while those who don’t play roguelikes and get the short end of the stick could put in 20 hours and feel like they aren’t getting anywhere. The key to Returnal is it keeps feeling fresh in each run, whether it’s getting a neat new alt-fire on a weapon or coming across an artifact that changes how you play. Everything has its place, and the way this game is built ensures plenty of replayability. There are even online challenges that will be available to add even more to your playthroughs!One of the areas that tends to get put on the back burner is the narrative behind Returnal. Make no mistake, it’s good, but because of the roguelike style those elements can feel a bit few and far in between. The House on Atropos and the abundance of audio logs do their best to fill in the gaps, but I found I often couldn’t follow what was happening because of either low amounts of explanation or my own mistakes keeping me from making it to the next story beat. A shroud of mystery helps to lessen the need for constant story set up, but it’s such a cool setting and narrative that you’d like to have more. That’s probably more of the “Sony First Party Third-Person Story game” player coming out in me, and honestly Returnal doesn’t suffer from the slower pace, but I’m selfish and want more.For all of the places Returnal leaves you in the dark in the story, the immersion of this title will leave you blinded by its luminance. I don’t want to go overboard, as we touched on a lot of this in our preview, but utilizing the tools at their disposal have put Housemarque on another level. Setting up the atmosphere of a game is something certain studios have down to a science, like Remedy with Control or Naughty Dog with The Last Of Us, but the way Housemarque has designed the environments you inhabit and added in the PS5’s 3D audio and the DualSense is remarkable. In the opening area you awake to the rainfall of the forest, and you might as well be there. It’s the combination of crafting believable surroundings on the screen, and then engaging your other senses with hearing the rush of wind and pitter patter of rain, along with haptics on your controller mimicking that rain. I expected Sony first party games to get here, but I didn’t expect it this quickly and from a developer best known for top down indies. Enjoying a video game is one thing, but feeling like you’re there is something craved by gamers everywhere. At this point I can’t imagine what we’re headed into with the PSVR2, and I hope Housemarque gets the chance to bring us even closer to Atropos when it arrives.Firsts don’t come around very often, but this is one of PlayStation’s first PS5 exclusives and Housemarque’s first triple A releases, and the combination is a triumphant success. I’m not sure how they’ve managed everything in play, taking the bullet-hell stylings of old and meshing them with the trappings of a third-person roguelike, but it works to a fantastic degree. On top of that, the action-packed gameplay is some of the best around, additionally being one of the most immersive and next-gen experiences available thanks to an incredible understanding of the DualSense controller. Yes, the story may take a backseat, but that’s the nature of the roguelike genre, and doesn’t hinder Returnal in the slightest. I may not be much for roguelikes, but I can see myself “returning” to play this one again and again.—David BurdetteSee below for our list of partners and affiliates:One of the longest running independent gaming news, reviews and culture sites on the web.The thing that is magical about the Wizarding World isn’t the magic – it’s...by Ron BurkeThe world is going to end.

Returnal,Keza MacDonald,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/may/12/returnal-review-epic-dance-of-death-with-beautiful-brutal-aliens,"PlayStation 5; Housemarque/SonyExceptionally hostile creatures are round every corner on a glorious, punishing quest through the perilous landscapes of another planetThis is not the best year for a game about being stuck in an eternal time loop, where nothing much changes but things are always extremely difficult. Many people will find it hard to find the motivation to face down a punishingly challenging game about the unreliability of memory and the elasticity of time. But, despite that, I didn’t find it hard to become totally absorbed in Returnal – it’s unforgiving, sometimes dispiriting but also intriguing, mysterious, and just glorious to play.As Selene, a deep-space scout, we crash on a planet called Atropos, full of eerily beautiful and exceptionally hostile creatures that look like the Borg on a nature trip and sound like something out of an Alex Garland movie. Leonine creatures with fronds of glowing LED tentacles leap towards you, emitting glowing orbs of death; looming robots shoot walls of orange bullets from the sky; skinny aliens screech and lob sticky acid.If it moves, it will try to kill you, and you’d better shoot back. Every time Selene dies – and this will be very often – she finds herself back at the crash site, in the middle of a jungle that remixes itself subtly every time, having lost every useful weapon or trinket or ability modifying parasite that she gathered on the last run.My first afternoon with Returnal took me through that jungle, past a couple of truly terrifying boss creatures, and through a Stargate-style portal to the arid ruins of the planet’s second area, the Crimson Wastes, in one epic four-hour run. I got lucky with a weapon I found early on, a shotgun-style thing with a secondary-fire mode that sent a horizontal wall of pain towards encroaching creatures. I found plenty of green pickups to refill and expand my health bar, and a weird alien machine-thing that resurrected me, and an upgrade for my suit that let me do more damage the closer Selene got to death.I danced through every altercation, dashing and jumping and sprinting around mesmerising patterns of plasma orbs and bullets to get up close. Movement and shooting are so fast in Returnal, so instinctive, that when things are going well you feel like the archdemon of bullet hell, surviving against the odds.Unfortunately, my shotgun turned out to be next to useless in the desert, which was mostly populated by ominous floating cubes with tentacles. By the time I got to the next boss, I was already struggling, and I flubbed it by sprinting into a pit trying to run away from a sword-wielding faceless alien that kept materialising behind my back. After that, it took me almost two days to get any further; on every attempt I seemed plagued by bad luck or failing skill. I kept coming across malignant items that caused my suit to malfunction when I picked them up, or falling through the floor to find a super-powerful mortar-firing turtle waiting for me, or opening chests to discover aggressive flying manta rays instead of a decent weapon. It was maddening. Over and over, I was sent back to the beginning. But still I kept playing.Everything in Returnal is a gamble, really. Because the planet changes every time, you never know whether the chamber ahead contains something useful, or a crowd of enemies that you’re not strong enough to face yet. You never know whether your next run will last two hours or 10 minutes. A momentary lapse of concentration in the heat of a fight can be enough to dispense with half your health bar, leaving you weakened before the next encounter.All of this is painful, but I always felt as if I had a chance – that next time I’d find out more about what the everliving hell had happened on this planet, or discover one of the rare artefacts or upgrades that Selene gets to keep, or squeak out of a fight that was very much not in my favour with a sliver of health and the sound of my heart pounding in my ears.I’ve always been drawn to games like this. Like the dark fantasy masterpiece Dark Souls, and Demon’s Souls before it, Returnal feels impenetrable and mysterious and sometimes even unfair, but opens itself up to a committed player. Failure is just learning. It helps tremendously that all the shooting and running and leaping just feel so good, no matter how often you do it. It’s an unlikely comparison, but Mario is the only other game I can think of where I’ve felt so perfectly in control of a character’s movement. This is a cutting-edge game with the DNA of some of gaming’s oldest genres, the arcade shoot-em-up, and it’s a fascinating combination. The planet looks and sounds extraordinary, each new area a distinctive biotechnological nightmare. If you’re going to spend hours stuck in a place like this, it helps that it’s so interesting to look at.After a while, you start coming across Selene’s other selves – corpses, or maybe not. Sometimes you find audio logs, and they are supremely chilling. I started to wonder how long she’d been stuck on this planet, whether the time I’d been controlling her was only a sliver of it. Was it even possible to get her home? Was even the idea of escape going to turn out to be an illusion? This is a game that sticks in the mind like that.I never knew what was ahead, and I was frequently surprised. There are spectacularly ominous sequences set in a derelict house that inexplicably turns up on Atropos, interludes that would belong in a superb psychological horror game. Something that happened at what turned out to be the midpoint of the game made all the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end, and made me realise all the time I’d spent pondering its themes was absolutely not wasted. A game hasn’t done that to me in a long time.To enjoy Returnal you have to abandon the idea of accomplishment, and stop looking for the breadcrumb trail of pleasing achievements that typically pulls you through a game. Forget about making progress. Forget about seeing the end. Once you do that, you can lose yourself in the near-infinite pleasure of the movement and combat, and the near-infinite mystery and creeping horror of Atropos. Every try is different, and yet also the same. But, with the right mindset, you can find meaning and pleasure in that instead of despair. Returnal is out now; £69.99."

			Dazzling next-gen graphics belie a hardcore rogue-like which could test your patience as much as your reflexes
		If BAFTA bestowing the Best Game accolade on Hades last month was a sign ‘rogue-likes’ had become mainstream, then the release of Returnal marks the hitherto hardcore niche genre’s breakout to bona fide blockbuster status. Sony’s first major PS5 exclusive of the year comes billed as a sci-fi psychological thriller but it owes as much to the ‘Live, Die, Repeat’ mantra of Tom Cruise’s Edge of Tomorrow than the claustrophobic horrors of Alien.You play as Selene Vassos, an Astro Scout space explorer who has crash landed on Atropos, an inhospitable planet teeming with hostile xenomorphs expertly equipped to end her life. When they (very quickly) do, Selene finds herself returned to the wreckage of her ship, destined to do the same thing again, and again, and again until she can solve the mystery at the heart of the alien civilisation that's trapping her in a time loop. As per the rogue-like genre’s demands, some equipment and resources carry over from one run to another - although not as much as you might expect or, indeed, need. Rather progress tends to come from getting to grips with Selene’s agreeably responsive and agile move-set and learning the lethal but predetermined attack patterns of her countless aggressors. And what attack patterns they are. Finnish developers Housemarque made their name with indie hits Super Stardust and Resogun, dazzling side-scrollers which subscribed to the ‘bullet hell’ school of shoot ‘em up design - ie: fill the screen with as many projectiles as possible and challenge the player can pick their way through somehow. That approach transitions to third-person combat superbly, the PS5’s advanced hardware filling entire arenas with ray-traced artillery salvos equal parts shock and awe bombardment and son et lumiere spectacular. Indeed, despite its undeniable indie roots, Returnal is very much the next gen experience. The visuals crackle and burn with HDR luminosity, the 3D audio sound design demands to be experienced through a decent pair of headphones (my trusty Turtle Beach Stealth 700s saved my life countless times) and the DualSense’s haptic feedback conveys every surface and raindrop Selene comes into contact with. Cleverly, the controller's adaptive triggers have also been employed to great gun-toting effect; a half-squeeze focuses your fire, while a full press unleashes each weapon’s secondary fire mode. The latter is one of numerous cool combat mechanics - some borrowed, some new - introduced to offset Returnal's inherently repetitive gameplay.  A welcome approximation of the Gears of War series’ active reload system adds an element of skill to the slaughter, while chaining kills grants Selene powerful buffs and abilities - although a single hit resets the count. It all makes for hellish, hypnotic and, frequently, hysterical action loops as you steer Selene through a succession of intense and invigorating encounters, often surviving by the most meagre of margins.Or not... Returnal is a punishing game which revels in the brutality of its challenge – and given the randomness baked in to the roguelike conceit, it doesn’t always feel like a fair one. Extreme difficulty spikes abound and ultimately twitch-like reflexes will only get you so far; the success or otherwise of any given run can often depend on which weapon types, buff-bestowing artefacts or consumables appear early on. I managed to blitz through one of the game's six biomes, boss-fight and all, at the first attempt thanks to a fortuitous combination of auto-healing augmentations and a launcher blessed with homing ammunition. Conversely, soldiering on with a sub-optimal build can be a dispiriting struggle. In an attempt to mitigate this Housemarque have weaved risk and reward mechanics into the very fabric of their game. Malignant items have a chance of also triggering suit malfunctions which must be cleansed by fulfilling mini-challenges such as killing certain foes, or using collectibles. Attachable alien parasites bestow both positive and negative modifiers, challenging you to decide what you can live with, and tempting side rooms offer the promise of great rewards but also the threat of elite enemies guarding them.Ultimately, though, the most significant risk/reward decision you’ll need to make is whether to invest in the game in the first place. In line with Sony’s controversial first party PS5 pricing policy, Returnal retails at an eye-watering £69.99 – and more casual shooter fans might be find better value elsewhere. If you're up for a cutting edge challenge, though, then Returnal should deliver more than enough bangs for your bucks."
Returnal,John-Paul Jones,PlayStation Universe,https://www.psu.com/reviews/returnal-review-pc/," John-Paul Jones / February 19, 2023Returnal PC review. Representing an astounding evolution of developer Housemarque’s signature arcade action into the third-person action adventure genre and with some natty takes on the roguelike formula to boot, when Returnal released on PS5 back in April 2021 it’s certainly reasonable to say that we were more than a little bowled over by it.The long-awaited release of Returnal on PC then is a cause for celebration. Not only does it bring across the PS5 Game of the Year candidate in all its glory, but it also adds the usual bevy of PC exclusive technical features that have been a reliable hallmark of PlayStation Studios efforts to bring PS4 and PS5 titles to the PC platform. To put it plainly, Returnal on PC continues PlayStation Studios grand tradition of going to the extra mile with its PC ports and I couldn’t be happier.First things first, Returnal is still an essential slice of third-person shooter shenanigans that everybody should play. Cast as Selene, a rugged space explorer that finds herself shipwrecked on the alien world of Atropos, Returnal puts players in her shoes, thrusts a firearm into their hands and sends them out into the wilderness in search of a mysterious signal that has been broadcasting non-stop since her arrival.Far from some straight-laced science-fiction tale about a shipwrecked protagonist, Selene actually finds herself locked in a time loop whereupon every time she dies, she awakes at the wreckage of her ship but armed with the knowledge of the life before. As it turns out, the planet of Atropos feeds directly into this dynamic too, shifting and changing its layout every time Selene starts her life anew while obviously playing directly into the roguelike design that underpins Returnal’s snappily responsive third-person arcade shooter action. In short, Returnal is a bespoke experience and thankfully I can confirm that the same uniqueness has survived wholesale in its leap from PS5 to PC. You can catch the full lowdown on Returnal’s deeper gameplay and systems in our original PS5 review, here.If you’re familiar with any of PlayStation Studios previous output on PC then you’ll also be familiar with the raft of exclusive technical features that are embedded into the PC version of Returnal. The first of these that you’ll notice is support for Ultrawide (16:10) and Super Ultrawide (32:9) display aspect ratios, both of which allow players to experience a massively expanded field of view as you explore and blast your way through the enigmatic alien environments of Atropos.Further Reading – All Best PS5 Exclusive Games – A Complete List Of Stunning PlayStation 5 ExclusivesThe next key technical benefit that Returnal on PC brings to the table (in addition to super sharp 4K resolution), is a range of higher quality ray-tracing visual presets that provide a frankly stunning standard of lighting, shadows and reflections that just weren’t present in the PS5 version of the game. The icing on technical cake for PC users ends up being support for performance enhancing technologies AMD FSR 2.0, NVIDIA NIS and NVIDIA DLSS – not least because playing a fast and furious blaster like Returnal at framerates in excess of 60 FPS enhances the experience duly, making Returnal feel more responsive to play than the OG PS5 version that came before it.In addition to the aforementioned visual improvements and no less than the five visual presets that Returnal on PC brings to the table, Housemarque have also implemented a number of neat technical features including including an FPS counter, a gauge for GPU and CPU usage and a latency tracker. Basically, it’s clear that Returnal has not only been made with the same love, care and attention that defined the PlayStation to PC ports that preceded it, but that the team behind it have that same compassion for their player base too, issuing a patch so very quickly after release day which resolves a number of visual, performance and crashing issues.Being a PlayStation Studios joint, Returnal also boasts full 3D audio support as well as full-bodied support for Sony’s excellent DualSense controller, allowing PC players to enjoy the same haptic feedback and implementation of adaptive trigger functionality that PS5 owners do. Put simply, Returnal not only continues Sony’s streak of providing PC gamers with excellent ports, but also in engineering a roundly impressive swathe of technical improvements that make the most of the additional potential technical headroom offered by the PC platform at large.Further Reading – Upcoming PS5 Games – The Most Anticipated PS5 Games Coming Soon In 2023In terms of its overall content offering, Returnal on PC thankfully includes all of the post-release that enhanced the PS5 version for the many weeks and months after its release back in April 2021. This means that not only does Returnal on PC enable players to tackle the mysteries of Atropos with a fellow explorer, but so too is the Tower of Sisyphus additional content also present alongside the super useful Suspend Cycle function which allows you to replay from a save state (I still find it somewhat baffling that this wasn’t part of the game on day one when it launched for PS5) and of course the now obligatory Photo Mode.Though the five rendering presets and substantial number of visual sliders and tweakables all combine to let players tailor Returnal to run on a variety of PC rigs, it’s also true that Returnal really does require a substantially setup to match the PS5 version of the game – let alone get the most from all of the super impressive visual enhancements that have been thoughtfully plumbed into the PC version of Housemarque’s arguably finest hour.As much as Returnal carved a niche of its own on PS5 as a stunning third-person shooter that had been masterfully blended with roguelike design, so too does it manage to inhabit a similarly unique place for PC gamers in 2023. One of the best PlayStation exclusives of 2021 has ended up being one of the best and most glossy PC shooters of 2023. Long may PlayStation Studios incredible run of PC ports continue.Returnal is out now on PC and PS5.Review code kindly provided by Sony PR.As much as Returnal carved a niche of its own on PS5 as a stunning third-person shooter that had been masterfully blended with roguelike design, so too does it manage to inhabit a similarly unique place for PC gamers in 2023.

Returnal,Mark Steighner,COGconnected,https://cogconnected.com/review/returnal-pc-review/,"I have a theory. I’m betting that most owners of high-end PCs with screaming GPUs probably also own a current-gen console. If said gamer was lucky enough to snag a PS5 back in 2021, there’s a fair chance they played Returnal. While it wasn’t billed as a system seller, it was still one of the biggest exclusives for Sony’s new console. So, should those who’ve played — or continue to play — Returnal pick it up again? And what about the countless PC gamers with “just okay” rigs, who never touched it on PS5?Returnal is a third-person action game-slash-shooter about a crash-landed survivor on a hostile planet. You play as Selene, who quickly discovers remnants of herself on the alien world. She realizes she has literally been there and done that before. This becomes Returnal’s gameplay hook. Die, and in roguelike fashion, you start another, procedurally generated run. Whatever weapons, currency, and consumables you picked are gone. Over time, however, you unlock some permanent upgrades, tools, and the ability to find better weapons. You press forward through a series of biomes, each with a particularly challenging boss. Returnal’s mechanics are easy to understand and become second nature in short order.Actually, all of Returnal is challenging. Early players and critics both praised and damned what was considered the game’s punishing difficulty. The bullet-hell style combat with multiple enemies and overlapping attacks could be overwhelming. What was worse, at launch there was no way to save a run mid-progress. The only way to preserve your game was to put the PS5 in rest mode. And then pray to the gods that there was no power failure. For the longest time, developers were steadfast in their vision of uncompromising difficulty.Eventually, though, updates after launch took some of the sting out of Returnal’s punishment. While there was — and still is — no multiple save system, players can now save mid-run. Last March, in the “Ascension” update, the ability to co-op the game became available. While hardcore gamers can ignore these quality-of-life changes, they’re a godsend for mere mortals. It could be argued that difficulty is baked into Returnal for a reason. We’ll save the philosophizing about game design for another time. Playing Returnal with another Selene — there is only one character model, after all — is unlike Dark Souls, where each participant has a very specific build. It’s more like two Selene’s plowing through the levels simultaneously.While plenty of newer PS5 games have bested Returnal’s graphics, it’s still a great-looking game two years later. The various biomes are distinctive and memorable, and the enemy design, weapon effects, and lighting are all excellent. Best of all, movement through the game is incredibly refined and a lot of fun. The music and sound design are likewise brilliant. If there’s a flaw, it’s that the modular, procedurally generated levels can become too familiar over multiple runs. On the upside, though, you learn where the secrets and goodies are hidden.Any current-gen console game ported to PC is expected to land with a long list of accessibility features, graphics enhancements, and added content. In theory, those with a better-than-baseline system should expect banger performance and lots of eye candy. Here’s where things get tricky. All I can do is report on how the game ran for me, on my system. Because there are so many permutations of CPUs, GPUs, and other variables, there’s no way to be really inclusive.Returnal’s recommended specs are an Intel i7-8700 (6 core 3.7 GHz) or AMD Ryzen 7 2700X (8 core 3.7 GHz), and for the GPU, an NVIDIA RTX 2070 SUPER (8 GB) or AMD RX 6700 XT (12 GB). My PC hits the recommended specs almost exactly, save for a slightly better RTX2080. With NVIDIA’s DLSS dialed in at the balanced setting, I had a rock solid 60 fps at 3840×2160. Cranking everything up to epic, the framerate hovered around the upper 50s, but there was some occasional, but noticeable, stutter during cutscenes. I had no issues with texture pop-in, crashes, or major bugs. Some initial loading times were long.Returnal on PC supports all the haptic feedback and bells and whistles of the DualSense Controller. It’s definitely the way to play if you have one. Thanks to the implementation of Sony Atmos, it sounds fantastic if you have a rig that supports it. Just like on the PS5, Returnal doesn’t have difficulty options, but there are a couple of aiming assists to play with. Aside from colorblind and sound settings, there aren’t a ton of accessibility features.I’ve been away from Returnal for some time, and coming back for the PC version was a happy reminder that, for a good long while, Returnal was my go-to action game. Two years later, its combination of fluid movement, engaging story, and challenging combat is still excellent. Some will still bounce off its difficulty but there are small ways to mitigate the pain. PC action game fans who missed Returnal when it was a PS5 exclusive are in for a great time.***PC code provided by the publisher for review***Developer: Housemarque, Climax StudiosPublisher: Playstation PC LLC"
Returnal,Alexander Thomas,COGconnected,https://cogconnected.com/review/returnal-review/,"She was a proud Astro Scout. Her record of service and strict adherence to the rules made her one of the best, but this time was different. She wasn’t supposed to go to Atropos. She wasn’t given permission to leave the ship. Selene jumped into her shuttle with a complete disregard for the rules and pursued the White Shadow signal, despite desperate calls from her crew to turn back. It was too late.Developed by Housemarque, Returnal is a beautifully crafted third person bullet-hell rogue-like experience with a seriously compelling narrative. Selene is an Astro Scout in pursuit of the White Shadow signal emanating from the plant Atropos. It’s a forbidden world, but her determination is unshakable as she enters the atmosphere, only to crash land her Helios shuttle on the surface. Upon exploring the strange, alien world, Selene encounters the body of a fellow scout… who turns out to be her! She is soon dispatched by a monstrous horror, only to awaken once more in the midst of her crash. Thus begins the cycle of the game.Let’s get this out of the way: Returnal is gorgeous. It makes full use of everything the PlayStation 5 has to offer, and it feels like the first boots on the ground for what we can expect in the future of gaming. Every single detail in the environment is immaculately rendered. Dust, mud, and debris cling to Selene’s suit. Every blade of grass sways just right. The tentacles and tendrils of each nefarious monster ebbs and flows just right. Environments feel lush and ominous in the best possible way, and half of why I don’t mind the cycle of dying and starting over is the chance to experience each biome again and again. While I don’t have the official PS5 3D Audio headset to take advantage of, the haptics are absolutely incredible. It may wear down the charge on your controller a little faster, but the results are astounding. You can feel the droplets of rain hitting Selene’s helmet, the impact of jumping off of a ledge, and the burst of energy as your weapon is fully charged. Returnal is not only a fantastic experience, it’s setting the groundwork for what gaming should be: fully immersive, breathtaking, and incredibly engaging on multiple levels.Selene is determined to find White Shadow. Along the way she will encounter more strange beasts, alien technology, ancient ruins, – and yes – even more of her own corpses. It seems Selene has been at this mission far longer than she remembers, with some recordings claiming she has repeated the cycle over 100 times, yet she doesn’t remember ever leaving these messages. It is a haunting experience to hear Selene at various states of her mental decay after so many cycles, but it only serves to add to the complex horror and nuanced narrative of the story. Some entries are more analytical about her situation while others pose philosophical and morbid ideas like wondering what she would find if she were to peel back her skin.I would be remiss if I didn’t talk about the phenomenal character of Selene and her depiction by voice actor Jane Perry. Selene is not the typical video game hero; she is a scientist and an explorer. An inquisitive intellectual fascinated by Greek mythology. She isn’t trigger happy, she isn’t terrified or a bumbling damsel. Selene is a real, flushed out character in an extraordinary situation. Jane Perry’s depiction of Selene, her analytical mind, her personal life at home, and the haunting situation she finds herself in is subtle and powerful. There is a nuance as Perry’s work takes center stage, and the delivery of each line says even more about who the character is in how she says each word. Returnal isn’t a game about being scared, it’s about being unsettled, and Selene is the perfect companion to have on this journey.Typical bullet-hell gameplay mechanics abound: you run fast with unlimited stamina, you can jump to avoid damage, and your dodge will grant you temporary invincibility when passing through the barrage of energy flying towards you. There are a limited variety of weapons, but the key is their firing methods. Returnal is generous with your weapon; each shot has a minor homing function so you don’t need to be pinpoint accurate while dodging for your life. It also has unlimited ammo and active reloading to keep you in the fight. Whether you prefer a pistol, a rifle, or a rocket launcher, there are plenty of ways to defend yourself, and you will be constantly discovering new weapons to try. Weapon proficiency is one of the factors that reset upon death, but is upgraded through successful kills and items found throughout the world. The higher your proficiency, the stronger the weapons you will find. It’s also worth noting that taking the hidden shortcuts to biomes you have previously visited will offer you a substantial boost in weapon proficiency so you aren’t left under-powered.There are plenty of interesting and effective items in each cycle, including a variety of consumable items for health and buffs, artifacts which offer passive skills and enhancements, and the creepy yet effective parasites. These are optional little creatures that offer a buff and debuff when latching onto you. Selene can allow multiple parasites to latch on and combine their abilities, creating an unsettling appearance as their tiny tentacles flick and flail around you. These parasites can offer a whole host of combinations with some detaching after completing a specific function. There are also two key factors to watch for in almost everything you might be tempted to interact with: Malignancy and Malfunction.Malignancy is a sort of status condition on certain items or interactive objects. Using it will grant its benefit – be it resources or a random artifact – but it also carries a chance of Malfunction. The item will clearly state what level of risk the item has, and if you have a means of clearing the malignancy. You can expend some resources to purify it, but should you choose to take the risk you’ll roll the dice in getting a malfunction. Selene’s suit is not unlike Samus’ Varia suit in that it is a technological marvel, able to interact with all manner of alien tech and integrate its functions, but that doesn’t mean it’s infallible. Malfunctions are often severely detrimental effects that display in the corner of the screen and require an objective to fix it – often to simply collect a random artifact. Due to the nature of procedurally generated worlds, however, you may not encounter an artifact for quite some time, and your very serious and determined run to push the mission forward could turn into a scouting mission in the hopes of finding a fix. There are other means to fixing a malfunction such as consumables, but it’s an interesting and oddly realistic approach to the game nonetheless.Returnal is a game that is tough but fair. It wants you to progress, it wants you to learn the story, but it also wants you to take your time and explore the horrifying beauty of Atropos. Each biome may be procedurally generated, but there are loads of collectibles and secrets to discover. It strikes an impressive balance between encouraging you to progress while also taking your time. One of the most appreciated features in the game is the use of different-shaped doors on your highly useful min-map. If you want to push on and progress the story, follow the square doors. If you want to speed along a shortcut to the furthest biome you have reached, follow the square doors with a circle above it, and if you want to keep exploring deeper into your current biome, aim for the triangle-shaped doors. It’s such a simple but incredibly effective tool to play each run how you want to play it.As mentioned, the levels are procedurally generated but at no point did it feel haphazardly stitched together. While you may recognize the layout of certain areas, it leans heavily into the narrative that Atropos is constantly evolving and mutating with each cycle. It is truly beautiful and with a few dozen hours under my belt, it still doesn’t feel repetitive. I still wander around that first biome and discover new rooms, new areas, and new items. It’s a game that can be a relaxing exploration through an alien world or an intense and visceral journey with an epic tale; how you play is up to you.Returnal is so much more than a rogue-like bullet-hell game. It tells a captivating, mysterious, and oftentimes haunting narrative with gorgeous, unsettling visuals and compelling voice acting. It offers a wide variety of collectibles, health upgrades, and unique features to give you a fresh and varied experience with each cycle, and gives players shortcuts so they can continue to press on with the story rather than have to complete every single biome time and time again. It’s tough but fair, with RNG playing a minor role in how difficult the next room will be. You’re going to die. A lot. That is the nature of this genre and this game, but it blends that concept so beautifully into the narrative design that you’ll only feel a momentary twinge of frustration before you set out again to help Selene reach the signal.**PS5 code provided by the publishers**Developer: HousemarquePublisher: Sony Interactive Entertainment"
Returnal,Eric Hauter,Gaming Nexus,https://www.gamingnexus.com/Article/7313/Returnal/,"Hello. My name is Eric Hauter, and I am a mediocre gamer. I’m not saying that to be self-deprecating, I’m saying it because it is true. My twitch skills are not great. I’m pushing 50, and I would like to blame my slow hands on my age, but in truth, I’ve always been somewhat fumbly. Its fine with me—my ego isn’t tied up in my ability to play difficult games—and there are plenty of titles with more deliberate pacing that I can enjoy.That’s not to say that I don’t like a challenge. I beat my head against the more difficult battles in Control until I had rolled credits on the game and all of the DLC. I enjoy Monster Hunter and Dauntless, neither of which are the most difficult games on the market, but they aren’t easy either. These are games that require the player to build up a skill set if they want to survive, which is something that I have a good time doing. It just takes me a little longer than more talented folks. I don’t write about video games because I am a savant gamer that thought I would take a swing at criticism; I write about games because I am a writer that really enjoys gaming.That’s a lot of background to give, but it's important context to have for the rest of this review. Because I want to say right out front that I haven’t beaten Returnal. I haven’t even come close. And in all likelihood, I will never see the credits. Returnal is a game that is beyond my skill set. It’s fine; I’m not going to hold that against the game. I simply cannot make progress very quickly—not for lack of trying—and the little progress that I have made took me far, far longer than it likely should have.In Returnal, players take on the role of a wayward space explorer, who has had possibly the worst luck in space exploration history. She has crashed onto a mysterious planet, strange and terrifying. There are signs all around of an ancient, vanished civilization, and things clearly came to a bad end a long time ago. Venturing out from her destroyed craft, our pilot, Selene, sets forth to find a way off the planet, and is promptly killed. But unfortunately for Selene, she cannot die, instead being caught in one of those Live-Die-Repeat-style loops that seem so prevalent in our entertainment right now.Upon dying, Selene promptly awakens on her careening ship, experiencing the whole fiery crash over again—with a few slight changes occasionally tucked in to move the story forward. To the player, this means that any forward progress they earned in their previous run is erased, and they must start from scratch. The only things that carry over are a few scant abilities: things that feel like they should be present from the beginning of the game, like a melee attack, or the ability to use the game’s fast travel system. Any weapons and equipment are gone, and the world has been reshuffled into a new configuration. Nothing is in the same place as it was before, and although the player will eventually start to recognize certain “rooms” and learn to navigate them, Returnal still pulls dark surprises out of its hat often enough that it would be wise to never let your guard down.I cannot overstate how devastating it is to die when you are in the midst of a good run. Occasionally you will find yourself on that rare run, when you have just the right randomized loot that you hoped for, and you have somehow miraculously pieced together a viable build, and it is all gone in the blink of an eye. You are right back on that crashing ship again for the umpteenth time, once again weak as a kitten. I won't say that I snapped a DualSense in half, but my controllers are a bit more wobbly than they used to be.My personal experiences with Returnal have oscillated between amazing, addictive fun, and dark, dark despair. A few days into playing Returnal, I sent a message to the Gaming Nexus Slack channel. It read, “I’ve played 11 and ½ hours. I’ve made 28 runs. I’ve defeated close to 1,000 enemies. I can survive quite comfortably in the first biome of Returnal, no matter what the game choses to throw at me. But I cannot beat the first boss, no matter how many times I try.”Returnal asks players to go on run after run after run, learning its mechanics as they go. Instead of building up a character with equipment or experience points, it’s the player that has to level up. Over time, coming to grips with the mechanics in Returnal can be very satisfying. And indeed, I did see my own abilities grow over time, but I had to stick with the game for far longer than expected to reach my current (rather low) plateau. The contingent of internet trolls that insist that other players git gud rather than complain about difficulty should start sharpening their knives—they are going to have a field day with Returnal.In the ensuing week since I sent that desperate Slack message, I have beaten that first boss (finally), and progressed further into the game, enjoying myself quite a bit. Playing Returnal just feels good. This game is tuned like B.B. King’s Lucille. But I want prospective players to understand exactly what they are getting into with Returnal. This is a game that is absolutely without pity, without remorse, without an ounce of interest in the player’s ability to succeed. Returnal will not stoop to pick you up after you fall again and again. No quarter will be given. Returnal demands that you stand up on your own and meet it on its level. As a result, a lot of people are going to bounce off this game. But for a certain subset of gamers that appreciate uber-hardcore experiences, Returnal will be an all-time favorite.Beyond FromSoftware’s Souls-like games—being the best analogy for the way Returnal needs to “click” before players can progress—I cannot recall a AAA release with a higher level of difficulty. Games like this simply don’t get made that often outside of the indie arena, and certainly not with the level of polish and love that was clearly slathered on Returnal. This is a game that screams next gen, utilizing every advanced feature of the PlayStation 5 that it could wedge into the experience.Returnal boasts some of the very best visuals I have ever seen in a game, with jaw-dropping clarity and a framerate that wouldn’t dream of slowing down, no matter how hot and heavy the action gets. I’ve had situations where I was fighting up to 15 opponents, all across the map. I’m jumping around like a lunatic, firing off my primary weapon and my special shot (which launches particles in every direction), while my enemies are surging around, stalking me and shooting energy balls at me from everywhere I look. We’re all moving, I’m screaming, there are hundreds of moving light sources on the screen, and it all just works. I’ve read that Returnal offers 4K/60FPS with Ray Tracing active. Normally I would never mention this sort of thing in a review, because I’m not a big tech guy, but in this case—damn. Returnal looks like it was beamed in from the future.The haptic feedback on the DualSense controller is worth noting as well, just due to how cool it is to feel the rain falling on your controller. The game also has a great control mechanic where you hold down the left trigger halfway to shoot through your sights, and jam it down fully to shoot your special. A function that would never have been possible on earlier systems, and it works great. After a few moments, this completely original control scheme becomes second nature, as though every game had always been like this. Speaking of shooting, every gun in Returnal feels incredible. Even the standard sidearm is ridiculously fun to shoot. As you wander you will discover better and better versions, making it possibly my favorite gun in the game. While the shooting doesn’t exactly use aim assist, the reticle for every weapon is enormous, allowing even poor shooters like me to pull off some pretty fantastic shots from across a sizable chasm. Aim any gun in an enemy’s general direction, and you will likely hit them. Returnal earns its difficulty in a lot of ways; forcing the player to be a sharpshooter is not one of them.It is clear after just a few moments of play that sound design on Returnal was a top priority during development. I was initially playing on my standard soundbar, but the way the sound of every shot makes you feel like you are being punched in the chest had me quickly switching over to a headset to protect my house from vibrating off the foundation. I can’t recommend a headset highly enough with Returnal, as the game utilizes PS5’s 3D Audio to help the player ascertain the location of enemies, which can be a total life saver. When enemies can swoop down from the sky, knowing that they are coming can be the difference between life and death.Enemies themselves are spectacular in design, pure Giger-inspired nightmare fuel. Most games, no matter how hard they try, end up with enemy designs that feel familiar. Returnal manages to pull off something fairly unique—enemies that are actually scary. Due to both their appearance and the intensity of their attacks, I find myself gripping my controller extra tight when certain baddies come on the screen. Many of these monster/aliens are all writhing tentacles, as one might expect, but I guarantee you’ve never seen tentacles like this before.For all my moaning at the beginning of the review, you might now think from my praise that I actually like Returnal. And I do, I honestly enjoy Returnal even though I suck at it. Returnal is the first PS5 game that I’ve played until my controller ran out of juice. I suck at it, and I’ve complained endlessly to my GN colleagues, but I haven’t bounced.When I was a kid, I enjoyed playing baseball even though I couldn't throw a ball to save my life. I’m not the best singer in the world, but I’ve been a vocalist in several bands over the years, making up in enthusiasm what I lacked in skill. Sometimes, if you want to do something in life, you just have to throw yourself at it, skill and ability be damned. That’s how Returnal is for me. I’m still playing Returnal, and I’m still going to be playing Returnal for quite a while to come.After all, no matter how many times I die, I can’t die.* The product in this article was sent to us by the developer/company.Howdy.  My name is Eric Hauter, and I am a dad with a ton of kids.  During my non-existent spare time, I like to play a wide variety of games, including JRPGs, strategy and action games (with the occasional trip into the black hole of MMOs). I am intrigued by the prospect of cloud gaming, and am often found poking around the cloud various platforms looking for fun and interesting stories.  I was an early adopter of PSVR (I had one delivered on release day), and I’ve enjoyed trying out the variety of games that have released since day one. I've since added an Oculus Quest 2 to my headset collection.  I’m intrigued by the possibilities presented by VR multi-player, and I try almost every multi-player game that gets released.
My first system was a Commodore 64, and I’ve owned countless systems since then.  I was a manager at a toy store for the release of PS1, PS2, N64 and Dreamcast, so my nostalgia that era of gaming runs pretty deep.  Currently, I play on Xbox Series X, PS5, PS4, PSVR, Quest 2, Switch, Luna, GeForce Now, (RIP Stadia) and a super sweet gaming PC built by John Yan.  While I lean towards Sony products, I don’t have any brand loyalty, and am perfectly willing to play game on other systems.
When I’m not playing games or wrangling my gaggle of children, I enjoy watching horror movies and doing all the other geeky activities one might expect. I also co-host Spielberg Chronologically, where we review every Spielberg film in order, which you can find wherever you get your podcasts.
