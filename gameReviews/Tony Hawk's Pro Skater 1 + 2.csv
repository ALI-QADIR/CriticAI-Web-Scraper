Link: Official site (opens in new tab)After the disastrous Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5, trepidation over these remakes is understandable. After all, the latter of the two games offered in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is one of the greatest games of all time. It starts so teasingly, with the right font, the right music and the right menu style. And then the final barrier between hoping and believing is literally smashed down as you careen through that first wall and into the iconic warehouse level. It looks great and it plays so well. THPS1 has been improved so much in terms of fluidity, visuals and its trick system, it’s more like an expansion pack for THPS3. Best of all, actual modernity is shunned entirely as you snap onto grind rails regardless of your approach angle and perform tricks with digital button combos instead of analogue stick waggling. The movement is rudimentary—some might say antiquated—but it still provides some of the finest risk vs reward play ever seen as you chain trick combos and grapple with balance meters at risk of losing everything with one mistake. Crucially, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 feels like the series did in its heyday, even if the games aren't exactly the same as the originals.The main change is the introduction of THPS2’s manual and THPS3’s revert flatland tricks into the package—the latter at the request of Tony Hawk himself. These make for a much more enjoyable and flowing game, with far higher scoring potential. Naturally, the goals have been elevated to fit, but this control uniformity does remove the little variety between the two games, so they don’t really feel that different any more. Now they both feel great. There’s an optional tutorial at the start of the game, and it’s worth playing even if you’re a Tony Hawk’s veteran, just so you’re aware of the systems used here that are borrowed from later games. Vicarious Visions has wisely stopped short of introducing the dismount and climbing features from Tony Hawk’s Underground. This feels pure and right.The game mostly plays out in timed, two-minute chunks. This structure means you can always enjoy a quick session, but, cleverly, the game keeps running even after the clock expires so long as you’re performing a trick or combo. If you’re good, you can theoretically keep skating for another minute or more after the buzzer. Even so, once you've done the treasure hunt style challenges like wall-ride 5 fire alarms or collect the letters S-K-A-T-E, you’ll find you rarely play the entire 2 minutes, due to instinctively reaching for the pause/restart sequence of button presses to try for a better run. If any criticism could be levelled at this aspect of the game, it would be that the slight delay of the transition screen should really have been removed, as the faster you can restart, the less break there is in the fun. It’s still fast, sure, but it should arguably be instantaneous.There are plenty of levels to explore and enjoy, but even if you’ve forgotten where all the collectible icons and secret tapes are, there really aren’t that many hours of career mode before veterans will start running out of things to do. A day, perhaps, maybe two. It's all expertly designed, and the constant drip of unlocks and checkmarks still makes for a very satisfying campaign while it lasts. (Speaking of which, unlocking the ‘mods’ like perfect rail balance basically breaks the finely-tuned skating, so best avoid those.)For those who want to squeeze every last drop from the package, there are loads of challenges to tick off. These come up on the right hand side whenever you go back to the main menu, and beating them unlocks new apparel, decks and videos to watch. It’s weird that ‘finding the secret tape’ doesn’t actually unlock any of the secret tapes, but hey ho. (No, stop that—don’t say ‘let’s go’—that was THPS3. Which also sadly means no Motorhead. But if this does well, perhaps we’ll get a remaster of THPS3 too. We can but hope.)Then there’s the multitude of gaps to jump, special tricks to learn and stats to upgrade. The game is simple enough that anyone can have fun on their first go (because even bailing spectacularly down the school steps is fun), yet has sufficient depth to keep you playing for weeks. There’s frequent joy in discovery as you open a hidden area, fun set pieces to watch and even occasionally some ‘judged’ sessions, where score can be affected by bailing, so it isn’t always just about the mega combos.Besides career, there’s the skate park builder mode complete with several levels designed by Vicarious Visions themselves, plus online leaderboards in a separate pillar of career mode. Sadly, some of these entries appear to have been hacked already, but it’s still obvious which times are real, so it still counts for something to do well.Then there’s online play with a round robin of event types, as you watch other boarders around you, thankfully with collisions switched off. Expect to be royally trounced by master players, but I didn’t experience any technical hiccups while I played it.Local multiplayer is exemplary too, with a smooth-running split screen mode and a wealth of game types including the riotous H-O-R-S-E, where you’re given a letter each time you lose to your buddy in a one-shot combo test. You can still change the word to whatever you like, so you either get called a horse, or much worse. It’s one of the best local multiplayer modes of all time, and it turns out ‘trick greed’ is a great leveller. Graphically, nothing here is phenomenal but it's a strong remaster of the old levels' basic geometry. Vehicles and skaters have far more detail, there's no obvious pop-in, and the lighting and texture work have many standout moments. My Nvidia RTX 2070 ran the game at 1080p on automatic max settings just fine for the most part, though did stutter a little on the longer, downhill-style levels, so some tweaking will likely be required if you want it to be perfectly smooth. Another technical hitch comes when the server connection drops, as the game freezes a few times in succession as it attempts to reconnect, which can completely destroy any combo you’ve got going on. Everything else is exactly as you’d hope. The soundtrack is censored (as usual) but it’s still great to hear Rage Against The Machine's Guerrilla Radio as you cannon around. Turn that ___ up.The fantastic score system, impeccable level design, improved visuals, exemplary online mode and local multiplayer means there’s very little to complain about here. Even veterans who blaze through it in a day will likely keep playing competitively. This is everything it needed to be, and feels surprisingly fresh. Lovely stuff. A perfect blend of authenticity mixed with modern quality of life enhancements. Joyous, slick, high-score gaming that looks nice too.

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2,Ben Tyrer,GamesRadar+,https://www.gamesradar.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-review-plenty-more-to-offer-than-just-trips-back-to-the-past/,"When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.A fitting remake for two of the best extreme sports games of all-time, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 offers up more than mere nostaglia, but a potential glimpse at what the future of the series could look like. Finally, a worthy Tony Hawk's gameAs good a restoration as we've seen this genMix of old and new keeps things freshGenerous challenge system will keep fans busySome maps have aged better than othersOnline multiplayer is slight Why you can trust GamesRadar+ 


Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy.The Tony Hawk's Pro Skater wilderness years are officially over. While fans will understandably remember the many (god, so many) times they've been burnt by the return of The Birdman in recent memory, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is a well-pitched palette cleanser for the series. It's both a nostalgic love letter to some of the best skateboarding games ever made and an exhilarating reminder that Tony could still have plenty more to offer than just trips back to the past. Mainly, that's because this feels like Tony Hawks. From the second you burst through the rotting wood barricade in Warehouse, every dormant muscle memory seems to screech into life, with the weight, momentum, and speed all seemingly ripped out of the old games and perfectly transplanted into this one. That includes the optimistic physics where you can grind up slopes by constantly starting a new grind on them and managing to grind high-up rails even if you're horizontal to them. All with a chaser of Goldfinger and Dead Kennedys to go with it. And it's all the better for it, because when you're rediscovering old favourite lines and spots (for me, it was grinding in a never-ending loop down by the fountain in NY City), there's a nostalgic joy from playing versions of these levels that are actually fun to play in the year of our Hawk 2020. Of course, heading back to the originals now would show just what time has done to them, so Vicarious Visions has done a stellar job of making the subtle tweaks it introduces seem like they've always been there. There are the obvious technical ones - this has the added benefit of 60fps fremerates compared to the PS1 original, while the soundtrack is a flawless mix of past classics and modern earworms - and some important ones for the skating itself. The addition of moves from later in the series, such as Spine Transfers, Acid Drops, and Reverts stitch old levels together in ways that make combos easier and gives the skating a velvet-smooth feel to go with how it looks. While the mind's eye may always be the kindest, this achieves the most important part of any remake: making it play like how you remembered it, not how it actually was. The developer also pulls this trick off with the visual design. Without wanting to be too vain, good lord do the areas you skate in look good. While the geography and objectives of every level remains virtually unchanged, each has been given a comprehensive touch-up. Venice Beach is now coated in graffiti and Magic Hour lighting, which pops even more with HDR. School actually looks like a school now rather than an industrial skate park with a few fire alarms slapped on, and Downtown's busy streets are even more enticing when they're lit up by street lamps and glowing signs. Plus, in one lovely touch, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2's opening level, Hangar, now has posters for every Neversoft Tony Hawk's game, along with a banner of the Neversoft logo. I could go on, but I'd rather get back to playing. The result of the visual upgrade is that these levels don't look out of place in 2020, but still carry all the old memories you have of them. However, despite these areas all looking equally impressive, there's a noticeable difference in the complexity in what you can do in them between Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and Pro Skater 2. While the original levels all tend to be self-contained, the sequel's versions come with a noticeable increase in scope and imagination. Comparing School and School 2 - which introduced a properly secret gym for you to explore, alongside different wings to skate through - is like stacking the first draft against the published article. This isn't necessarily a bad thing - you can't really knock Vicarious Visions for sticking with history -  but the game's focus on replaying levels means that I find myself naturally gravitating to the sequel's maps.  Speaking of replaying levels, a simple online multiplayer mode gives you plenty of scope for playing with friends or other random skaters across the world. While I didn't get a chance to start a party to skate with IRL friends, Quick Play drops you into a map and cycles through classic multiplayer matches such as Trick Attack (highest score wins), Combo Mambo (highest combo wins), and Graffiti (most tagged items wins). While fun to dip in and out of, it does feel slight in a way the rest of the game doesn't.   In perhaps the game's biggest change, the game's overall structure has been completely rethought to put an emphasis on a whole slew of challenges alongside the traditional checklist of objectives. And by slew, I mean 700-odd challenges. They range from easy pickings such as completing the tutorial to more demanding feats such as getting a Sick Score in each level in a single combo. There's also specific skater challenges, Create-A-Park challenges, multiplayer challenges… and yeah, there's a lot. If you're a cosmetic obsessive, welcome to your Mount Everest. 

Initially, it's daunting to see so many 'Challenge Completed!' signs pop up while skating, especially as there's a healthy chance you'll have no idea what they're for. However, once you start getting past a few levels and getting a steady stream of cosmetics to deck your Create-A-Skater out in, they're not quite the wall of distractions they might initially appear to be. In fact, I've already 100%'d both Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 with my skater, but going through the hundreds of challenges has given me reason to dive back in and try different things. While it's too early to call if I'll still be checking stuff off in a month or two, the structure is in place to give me reasons to head back.      Of course, Tony Hawk's was never really about collectibles. It's always been at its best when you're dancing on the edge of chaos, stringing together combos as balance meters wobble worryingly over your skater, all to the tune of infectious punk and somehow making it look as graceful as Tony Hawk has aged. Few mainstream games manage to nail this particular juxtaposition of frenzied calm, which is probably why it's hard not to completely fall in love with it again. From hurling myself off rooftops to A Tribe Called Quest to rooting through Venice Beach to find half-pipe gaps, the adrenaline buzz this generates doesn't come purely from nostalgia, but the fact that this physics-defying brand of skating at its purest still has plenty of life left in it. Vicarious Visions has built an engine that could actually push the series in a new direction, with the focus on skating rather than gimmicks that came from the annual release cycle that the series was stuck in.

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2,Brian Shea,Game Informer,https://www.gameinformer.com/review/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-and-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-and-2-review-once-again-nailing-the,"Forget the weird peripherals, bad sequels, and questionable ports that defined Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater in the series’ later years. Instead, remember the glory days of the late ‘90s and early ‘00s, because that’s where you’re going with Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 and 2. By returning to the first two games in the franchise and modernizing them with changes large and small, developer Vicarious Visions reminds us why we fell in love with this series in the first place.The overall structure remains completely intact: You select levels based on various locations around the globe, then hop on your skateboard to complete objectives like getting the high score before the time limit expires, collecting letters to spell out “skate,” and doing tricks over specific areas. Vicarious Visions keeps the best parts of the game largely intact, but various enhancements, including a larger arsenal of tricks, lifts these classics to new heights. Stringing together tricks feels amazing thanks to smoother controls, and the modern visuals look great in motion.While these games are fun independent of nostalgia, as a fan of the original games, I loved how this release gives continual nods to the classic versions. Featuring every single real-life skater from those first two games, an enhanced create-a-skater mode, and nearly every song from the classic soundtracks, this is a crowd-pleasing remaster bundle. Stepping back into the shoes of Tony Hawk and crushing a halfpipe as Goldfinger’s “Superman” comes over my speakers brought a smile to my face. However, this bundle also adds several current-day skaters and a huge selection of new songs. By masterfully blending old with new, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 and 2 lands on a sweet spot.All the levels from the original games are also available, complete with beautiful makeovers for the current technology. I was continually impressed by how gorgeous these new environments look. The stages feel faithful to the versions you played 20 years ago, while simultaneously featuring the look of new creations. Perhaps most surprising is how well the levels hold up today; skating through the streets of San Francisco and New York still feels great, and the timeless designs of Warehouse, Hangar, and the Chicago Skatepark have me returning time and again. The levels feature fun paths on which you can chain together massive combos, as well as enormous ramps to launch off, countless rails and edges to grind on, and plenty of objects to smash through. The only downside to these stages is that some of the objects you’re supposed to destroy, like the school’s bells or the “No Skating” signs in Minneapolis can be more difficult to spot since there’s a lot more going on with the visuals now.If you’re looking for new places to skate, you can design the park of your dreams. With a massive set of elements choose from, including smart objects you can curve at multiple articulation points, the intuitive creation tools make it easier than ever to transpose the park from your mind to the screen. Once you finish, you can upload your creation to share with other players. I loved exploring the community feature; my favorite created parks ended up being the zany ideas, like an automated rollercoaster for you to grind along, rather than the more traditional skateparks. Unfortunately, I sometimes got stuck inside of objects in created parks as the pieces don’t fit together as perfectly as they do in the developer-created levels.Outside of sharing your parks, you can also jump into online matches. In the frantic and fun online sessions, you compete in a randomized objective playlist of quick-hit matches where eight players vie for the top spot. These objectives are as simple as getting the best score within the time limit or landing the best single combo, or as off-the-wall as graffiti mode, where you try to tag as many of the objects as possible by performing tricks on them. I love how you’re essentially into the next match as soon as you finish the one before it, with players able to seamlessly join and drop out without everyone else needing to return to a lobby. While I enjoy the structure of the online play, the experience wears thin fast due to repetitive objectives and an inability to play some of the local multiplayer offerings like H-O-R-S-E- and Tag online. Despite earning cash to spend on cosmetics in the skate shop, I didn’t feel motivated to stick around for more than a few rounds at a time.Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 and 2 makes the experience of playing through these games again feel fresh and current. With contemporary visuals, smooth gameplay, and the iconic soundtrack you remember, the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater franchise may once again have a bright future thanks to this terrific blast from the past.

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2,Mat Paget,GameSpot,https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-review/1900-6417555/,"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 deftly recreates the original games' levels while implementing smart additions to the trick system and creating engaging challenges.By 
    Mat Paget
   on March 25, 2021 at 10:39AM PDTUpdate (March 25, 2020): Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 was a capable game on PS4 and Xbox One, running at variable resolutions while keeping that locked 60fps experience intact. It was hard for me to visualize what exactly developer Vicarious Visions could do aside from bumping up the resolution on the new generation of consoles, but after playing both the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions, it's clear the remake has some improvements that, while not drastic changes to the already incredible game, are undeniably impactful.THPS 1+2 on the new consoles offers two different display modes: Fidelity and Performance. Both modes feature improved shadows and lighting, which makes already beautiful stages like School and Venice Beach look even more impressive. Fidelity kicks the resolution on both consoles up to native 4K while retaining that buttery smooth 60fps; Performance, on the other hand, drops the resolution to 1080p but targets 120fps. On Xbox Series X, Performance mode feels even smoother and more responsive than the already pristine Fidelity mode. The speed of the high frame rate makes an already exciting game more exhilarating, comparable with the fantastic PC version. And thanks to the Xbox's support for FreeSync and HDMI 2.1's VRR, the variable frame rate is smoothed out, providing the best experience on consoles.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 Video ReviewBecause the PS5 doesn't support any adaptive sync technology, Performance mode's variable frame rate is much more apparent on the console, which means gameplay is plagued with frame rate inconsistency. For a game that requires responsive controls and a consistent frame rate, this is detrimental to the overall experience--I found myself dropping combos on the PS5 that I could easily finish on Xbox Series X. The PS5's lack of VRR support is frustrating, as it's the only thing standing in the way of Performance mode shining. Regardless, the Fidelity mode still provides excellent visuals and a solid frame rate. And both consoles show improved load times over their last-gen counterparts.The PS5's DualSense controller also provides some gameplay additions. THPS 1+2 utilizes the DualSense's haptic feedback and adaptive triggers to provide enhanced rumble. The subtle rumble of your skateboard as you manual across the concrete evokes the real-life feeling of your wheels gliding across the blacktop. And when performing a revert, you'll notice a slight resistance, with your triggers locking up completely if you bail. The haptic feedback is an immensely pleasurable feature, but the adaptive triggers were distracting and an impediment to my high score--turning them off made me feel more comfortable stringing together combos.It's no surprise that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 is still a spectacular game. The near-perfect recreation of two of gaming's most beloved titles has been improved upon in some smart ways, utilizing the power of both the PS5 and Xbox Series X to push the image quality, resolution, and frame rate to new heights. And if the PS5 ever gets an update to add VRR support, the Performance mode will shine just as bright as it does on the Xbox Series X. - Mat Paget | The original review, first published on September 3, 2020, continues below. It's wild to think that long before there was a new Call of Duty game every year, Activision's big annual franchise was Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. It's a series in which you only have to worry about tying off each ludicrously long combo before you bail and lose hundreds of thousands of points. With the sounds of bands like Goldfinger and Rage Against the Machine burned into your head, you scour each dense park in search of S-K-A-T-E and that elusive secret tape. And as soon as you finally find them, it's time to restart the two-minute timer and jump back in for one last go--which you already told yourself was three sessions prior. The stimulating trick system keeps you clawing for larger numbers, while the cleverly crafted levels lead you to new gaps, lines, and secrets to add to your combo's path. It's a special series that is infinitely playable, and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 captures that nearly perfectly.Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 revamps the levels and skaters of the first two games, though it borrows many aspects from later titles as well. While the trick system's foundation stuck through the entire series' history, various trick types were added with each new release. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 features many of the best ones, including reverts and spine transfers, and thankfully, it doesn't stray further than Underground's wallplants and grind/manual transitions. This makes 1 + 2's trick system feel complete, neglecting the less crucial mechanics--like Freak Out from Underground 2--and focusing on the best aspects of the series' tricks. One very nice touch, however, lets you switch between the revamped trick system and the first and second game's trick systems, offering a more authentic experience akin to the originals.No matter which trick system you go with, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 plays fantastically. While you still control it the exact same way you would the originals, it feels a lot less stiff. Tricks are as exciting to pull off as they've ever been, but the speed of the game moves faster and the skaters' animations are a lot more fluid. Transitioning from grab tricks and spins into a string of manuals and then finishing with a set of grind transitions feels incredible--it evokes the series' early days of nailing unrealistic and goofy combos, while also remaining engaging and exciting when you're checking off goals in 2020.Levels have received makeovers, and each one looks absolutely stunning. Whether you're skating on Venice Beach or bombing it through the dilapidated Mall, it's quite shocking to see these classic stages with much more detail--and with much less fog than on the original PlayStation. The sunset on Venice Beach hits with vibrant oranges and reds that give a whole new mood to the oceanside level, while the Mall is overgrown with plants and plywood-barricaded stores; it almost looks post-apocalyptic. I never saw the Mall as abandoned or even run-down, but this new take--along with many other new looks--afforded by an increase in details makes it feel like you're experiencing a brand-new level, even if the layout is the same.Some stages feature subtle new touches such as drones filming you in Downhill Jam or a stray cat running in the background of Warehouse. These small details breathe life into levels that felt lonely and lifeless in their original releases. It's really quite charming. However, loading into some of the parks can take a considerable amount of time--starting up Streets, San Francisco, for the first time made me think the game had crashed. Restarting your run (something you'll likely do a lot of) can also take up to five seconds in some instances. The original games were quite snappy, and you were able to restart your run quickly if you weren't happy with how your session was going. Five seconds isn't a big deal and didn't impede my enjoyment too much, but when the rest of the game nails the THPS experience, it's hard not to notice the smallest of divergences.Pro Skater 1 + 2 also sees the addition of collectible stat points. These were introduced in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3. Prior to that game, you would collect cash hidden throughout each level and spend it on upgrading your skater. Original developer Neversoft did a great job hiding this cash throughout each level, encouraging you to explore every nook and perform tricks on every cranny. Pro Skater 1 + 2's stat points miss the mark since you don't have to explore an entire level to collect everything. Because the levels are so well designed, it's disappointing to see that covering the entire map isn't required to complete every goal.Many of the original games' goals are present, with a few added to beef up the meager THPS1 checklists. Among other things, these goals task you with collecting the letters S-K-A-T-E, performing specific tricks at specific spots, and causing general mayhem--for example, destroying cop cars or draining public fountains. Once you complete a goal, it's completed for every skater. In the original games, each skater had their own career to play through, giving you the option to complete all of the goals with every playable skater. Once I finished my first playthrough with Rodney Mullen, I started up a playthrough with Leticia Bufoni only to find that all of the goals had already been completed. I can still play through every level to collect her stat points, but it can feel oddly empty without these objectives.That said, you're not left without stuff to do once you've finished your first playthrough. THPS 1 + 2 introduces a whole slate of challenges that have you completing specific feats with each skater on each park. These include performing different kinds of combos, doing specific things on specific levels, and various other tasks. While a challenge isn't your typical Tony Hawk goal, they do add a layer of objectives that are well worth taking on--and there are a lot of them. Some of these challenges are pretty tough, too, which makes it particularly rewarding when you start ticking them off. THPS's core mechanics are engaging enough to be the sole reason you play, but these challenges give you compelling new goals to chase as you extend combos and try to best your top scores.Completing challenges also rewards you with new decks, gear, and other items in addition to money and XP, which can unlock even more gear. The real professional skaters featured in the game have specific clothing and decks you can unlock, while all of the purchased and unlocked items can be equipped to your created skaters. There are no signs of real-money microtransactions; instead, you'll need to rely on completing challenges to accrue more in-game cash. This feels fair, and aside from some visual flair, there is no effect on your points, combos, or anything else. It's all about making your created skater look cool, which is easy to do with the wide selection of gear, from punk-oriented threads to the most stylish drip (plus a well-crafted character creator that offers a good variety of options).The soundtrack also boasts music fit for a Tony Hawk's Pro Skater game. Many of the original tracks return for 1 + 2, but a lot of new music is also included. These all fit in with the rest of the tracks, and if it wasn't for their respective release dates, it's easy to imagine them on the original soundtracks. It's an eclectic mix of hip hop and punk, with impeccable inclusions like ""Can I Kick It?"" by A Tribe Called Quest, ""She's Famous Now"" by Reel Big Fish, and ""Shutdown"" by Skepta. The music also reacts to your gameplay, adding a subtle reverb when you fill your special meter and a slight muffle when you bail. It's a well-used soundtrack that reminds me of why Tony Hawk's Pro Skater is remembered for its music as much as its mechanics.Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 also comes with some multiplayer features, including Create-a-Park and various versus modes. Create-a-Park lets you do exactly as it says, and it's a pretty extensive and easy-to-use tool for creating your own levels. You have to unlock cosmetic parts for your custom parks through challenges, but you get all of the necessities by default, which is enough to create a playable and entertaining park. Sharing levels with other players is also possible, and there are already a number of custom parks that show off both quality and silliness. Because you can share your maps, it's a far more enjoyable mode than it ever was in its early days, and I'm really excited to see what a potential community creates.As for its multiplayer, THPS 1 + 2 offers both local and online versus modes. A lot of the game types take after the original games' multiplayer, with modes like Graffiti, Trick Attack, and Tag as well as new ones like Combo Mambo and Score Challenge. Horse, one of the all-time best modes, also returns, and while it's mostly a great time, some infrequent frame dropping can occur. It's a bit surprising, since you just take turns trying to outdo your friend's score and it doesn't feel particularly demanding. Even more surprising is the fact that the split-screen modes don't come with these performance issues. The online multiplayer, on the other hand, runs very well as it rotates through various modes in a lobby--it’s an exciting way to hang out with friends, skate, and compete for the highest score.Because it nails so much about that original Tony Hawk experience, it's really hard to be mad at Pro Skater 1 + 2 for any of its downsides. The load times aren't enough to keep you away from the plethora of satisfying combos, and the lack of level goals for every skater isn't enough to keep you from jumping back in with a new character. Playing through the newly remade levels is immensely enjoyable, and that on its own is enough to call Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 a success. However, smart additions and an engaging challenge system make it an experience that's more than just a brief skate through Tony Hawk's past.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2,Mat Paget,GameSpot,https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-review-lights-out/1900-6417555/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f,"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 deftly recreates the original games' levels while implementing smart additions to the trick system and creating engaging challenges.By

   on March 25, 2021 at 10:39AM PDTUpdate (March 25, 2020): Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 was a capable game on PS4 and Xbox One, running at variable resolutions while keeping that locked 60fps experience intact. It was hard for me to visualize what exactly developer Vicarious Visions could do aside from bumping up the resolution on the new generation of consoles, but after playing both the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions, it's clear the remake has some improvements that, while not drastic changes to the already incredible game, are undeniably impactful.THPS 1+2 on the new consoles offers two different display modes: Fidelity and Performance. Both modes feature improved shadows and lighting, which makes already beautiful stages like School and Venice Beach look even more impressive. Fidelity kicks the resolution on both consoles up to native 4K while retaining that buttery smooth 60fps; Performance, on the other hand, drops the resolution to 1080p but targets 120fps. On Xbox Series X, Performance mode feels even smoother and more responsive than the already pristine Fidelity mode. The speed of the high frame rate makes an already exciting game more exhilarating, comparable with the fantastic PC version. And thanks to the Xbox's support for FreeSync and HDMI 2.1's VRR, the variable frame rate is smoothed out, providing the best experience on consoles.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

For a game that requires responsive controls and a consistent frame rate, this is detrimental to the overall experience--I found myself dropping combos on the PS5 that I could easily finish on Xbox Series X. The PS5's lack of VRR support is frustrating, as it's the only thing standing in the way of Performance mode shining. Regardless, the Fidelity mode still provides excellent visuals and a solid frame rate. And both consoles show improved load times over their last-gen counterparts.The PS5's DualSense controller also provides some gameplay additions. THPS 1+2 utilizes the DualSense's haptic feedback and adaptive triggers to provide enhanced rumble. The subtle rumble of your skateboard as you manual across the concrete evokes the real-life feeling of your wheels gliding across the blacktop. And when performing a revert, you'll notice a slight resistance, with your triggers locking up completely if you bail. The haptic feedback is an immensely pleasurable feature, but the adaptive triggers were distracting and an impediment to my high score--turning them off made me feel more comfortable stringing together combos.It's no surprise that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 is still a spectacular game. The near-perfect recreation of two of gaming's most beloved titles has been improved upon in some smart ways, utilizing the power of both the PS5 and Xbox Series X to push the image quality, resolution, and frame rate to new heights. And if the PS5 ever gets an update to add VRR support, the Performance mode will shine just as bright as it does on the Xbox Series X. - Mat Paget | The original review, first published on September 3, 2020, continues below. It's wild to think that long before there was a new Call of Duty game every year, Activision's big annual franchise was Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. It's a series in which you only have to worry about tying off each ludicrously long combo before you bail and lose hundreds of thousands of points. With the sounds of bands like Goldfinger and Rage Against the Machine burned into your head, you scour each dense park in search of S-K-A-T-E and that elusive secret tape. And as soon as you finally find them, it's time to restart the two-minute timer and jump back in for one last go--which you already told yourself was three sessions prior. The stimulating trick system keeps you clawing for larger numbers, while the cleverly crafted levels lead you to new gaps, lines, and secrets to add to your combo's path. It's a special series that is infinitely playable, and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 captures that nearly perfectly.Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 revamps the levels and skaters of the first two games, though it borrows many aspects from later titles as well. While the trick system's foundation stuck through the entire series' history, various trick types were added with each new release. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 features many of the best ones, including reverts and spine transfers, and thankfully, it doesn't stray further than Underground's wallplants and grind/manual transitions. This makes 1 + 2's trick system feel complete, neglecting the less crucial mechanics--like Freak Out from Underground 2--and focusing on the best aspects of the series' tricks. One very nice touch, however, lets you switch between the revamped trick system and the first and second game's trick systems, offering a more authentic experience akin to the originals.No matter which trick system you go with, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 plays fantastically. While you still control it the exact same way you would the originals, it feels a lot less stiff. Tricks are as exciting to pull off as they've ever been, but the speed of the game moves faster and the skaters' animations are a lot more fluid. Transitioning from grab tricks and spins into a string of manuals and then finishing with a set of grind transitions feels incredible--it evokes the series' early days of nailing unrealistic and goofy combos, while also remaining engaging and exciting when you're checking off goals in 2020.Levels have received makeovers, and each one looks absolutely stunning. Whether you're skating on Venice Beach or bombing it through the dilapidated Mall, it's quite shocking to see these classic stages with much more detail--and with much less fog than on the original PlayStation. The sunset on Venice Beach hits with vibrant oranges and reds that give a whole new mood to the oceanside level, while the Mall is overgrown with plants and plywood-barricaded stores; it almost looks post-apocalyptic. I never saw the Mall as abandoned or even run-down, but this new take--along with many other new looks--afforded by an increase in details makes it feel like you're experiencing a brand-new level, even if the layout is the same.Some stages feature subtle new touches such as drones filming you in Downhill Jam or a stray cat running in the background of Warehouse. These small details breathe life into levels that felt lonely and lifeless in their original releases. It's really quite charming. However, loading into some of the parks can take a considerable amount of time--starting up Streets, San Francisco, for the first time made me think the game had crashed. Restarting your run (something you'll likely do a lot of) can also take up to five seconds in some instances. The original games were quite snappy, and you were able to restart your run quickly if you weren't happy with how your session was going. Five seconds isn't a big deal and didn't impede my enjoyment too much, but when the rest of the game nails the THPS experience, it's hard not to notice the smallest of divergences.Pro Skater 1 + 2 also sees the addition of collectible stat points. These were introduced in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3. Prior to that game, you would collect cash hidden throughout each level and spend it on upgrading your skater. Original developer Neversoft did a great job hiding this cash throughout each level, encouraging you to explore every nook and perform tricks on every cranny. Pro Skater 1 + 2's stat points miss the mark since you don't have to explore an entire level to collect everything. Because the levels are so well designed, it's disappointing to see that covering the entire map isn't required to complete every goal.Many of the original games' goals are present, with a few added to beef up the meager THPS1 checklists. Among other things, these goals task you with collecting the letters S-K-A-T-E, performing specific tricks at specific spots, and causing general mayhem--for example, destroying cop cars or draining public fountains. Once you complete a goal, it's completed for every skater. In the original games, each skater had their own career to play through, giving you the option to complete all of the goals with every playable skater. Once I finished my first playthrough with Rodney Mullen, I started up a playthrough with Leticia Bufoni only to find that all of the goals had already been completed. I can still play through every level to collect her stat points, but it can feel oddly empty without these objectives.That said, you're not left without stuff to do once you've finished your first playthrough. THPS 1 + 2 introduces a whole slate of challenges that have you completing specific feats with each skater on each park. These include performing different kinds of combos, doing specific things on specific levels, and various other tasks. While a challenge isn't your typical Tony Hawk goal, they do add a layer of objectives that are well worth taking on--and there are a lot of them. Some of these challenges are pretty tough, too, which makes it particularly rewarding when you start ticking them off. THPS's core mechanics are engaging enough to be the sole reason you play, but these challenges give you compelling new goals to chase as you extend combos and try to best your top scores.Completing challenges also rewards you with new decks, gear, and other items in addition to money and XP, which can unlock even more gear. The real professional skaters featured in the game have specific clothing and decks you can unlock, while all of the purchased and unlocked items can be equipped to your created skaters. There are no signs of real-money microtransactions; instead, you'll need to rely on completing challenges to accrue more in-game cash. This feels fair, and aside from some visual flair, there is no effect on your points, combos, or anything else. It's all about making your created skater look cool, which is easy to do with the wide selection of gear, from punk-oriented threads to the most stylish drip (plus a well-crafted character creator that offers a good variety of options).The soundtrack also boasts music fit for a Tony Hawk's Pro Skater game. Many of the original tracks return for 1 + 2, but a lot of new music is also included. These all fit in with the rest of the tracks, and if it wasn't for their respective release dates, it's easy to imagine them on the original soundtracks. It's an eclectic mix of hip hop and punk, with impeccable inclusions like ""Can I Kick It?"" by A Tribe Called Quest, ""She's Famous Now"" by Reel Big Fish, and ""Shutdown"" by Skepta. The music also reacts to your gameplay, adding a subtle reverb when you fill your special meter and a slight muffle when you bail. It's a well-used soundtrack that reminds me of why Tony Hawk's Pro Skater is remembered for its music as much as its mechanics.Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 also comes with some multiplayer features, including Create-a-Park and various versus modes. Create-a-Park lets you do exactly as it says, and it's a pretty extensive and easy-to-use tool for creating your own levels. You have to unlock cosmetic parts for your custom parks through challenges, but you get all of the necessities by default, which is enough to create a playable and entertaining park. Sharing levels with other players is also possible, and there are already a number of custom parks that show off both quality and silliness. Because you can share your maps, it's a far more enjoyable mode than it ever was in its early days, and I'm really excited to see what a potential community creates.As for its multiplayer, THPS 1 + 2 offers both local and online versus modes. A lot of the game types take after the original games' multiplayer, with modes like Graffiti, Trick Attack, and Tag as well as new ones like Combo Mambo and Score Challenge. Horse, one of the all-time best modes, also returns, and while it's mostly a great time, some infrequent frame dropping can occur. It's a bit surprising, since you just take turns trying to outdo your friend's score and it doesn't feel particularly demanding. Even more surprising is the fact that the split-screen modes don't come with these performance issues.

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2,Ben Kuchera,Polygon,https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/9/3/21418230/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-and-2-review-remaster-ps4-xbox-pc,"Filed under:An impossible game in 2020Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater was a series doomed from the beginning. The idea itself was perfect: What if a game let you skate in all those amazing places around your city — and in some cases, around the world — that you’ve always dreamed of seeing while atop your board? What if your school, an airplane hangar, or the local mall were just yours, and you were free to try pretty much any trick you could think of? Each round was two minutes of bliss as you tried to nail a longer combo, increase your score, or master the perfect run of tricks. It was all for you, and the limitations of each run were just as important as the possibilities. The first Pro Skater was released in 1999, back when people still traded VHS tapes and kids got yelled at for skating in parking lots. If there were ever a game that introduced a mainstream audience to a niche lifestyle, this was it. Suddenly, the masses got an idea of why people skate, and saw a grinning, goofy face of the sport in Tony Hawk himself. It was a series that arguably brought skateboarding beyond skate parks, empty pools, and zines. Everyone seemed to be playing it, in trancelike two-minute sessions over and over again. We learned the rhythm of the ollie, the difference between vert and street skating, and the joy of the endless combo once reverts and manuals were introduced.

You’d react to your own performance, improvising to keep runs smooth and clean. The best part? You didn’t have to risk life and limb practicing to feel like a skater. Play it enough, and you started to see the real world as one huge course, begging to be skated.Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 and 2 joins a proud tradition of Activision selling us the same game in the same series multiple times; it’s the third attempt at remixing and re-releasing some version of this content, after Tony Hawk 2X on the original Xbox in 2001 and Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater HD in 2012. But this is the first time anyone has been able to do it right in the past decade or so. The controls and feel of the first two Tony Hawk games have been left intact, with a beautiful visual upgrade and a selection of modern improvements and sly edits of the original content. I think I feel a slight difference in keeping vert runs going, and things can get a little goofy — pardon the pun — after you level up your skater to jump much higher and spin for much longer than any human conceivably could, but these are also areas where I’ve always struggled with the series. I’m curious to read more from the ultra-hardcore players, but as a moderately serious player, I’m satisfied with the solid, if sometimes unpredictable, re-creation of the original skating engine. Which is just what the series needs. Pro Skater was never just about learning how to land signature tricks; it was about how to make your path through each level flow like water, creating something that looked and felt both effortless and beautiful. There was nothing realistic about it, but it matched how I felt skateboarding should be, based on my pop culture understanding of it. Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 and 2 keeps that feeling, while adding to the fantasy through the rebuilt character models and levels. The updated visual fidelity isn’t a distraction; it adds to the fantasy of actually skating in these places, which is an important distinction when it comes to what “realistic” graphics do for a game. War games, on one hand, can get more disturbing as they approach photorealism. With more detail, the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater games deliver a better fantasy of skating through these places. The Hangar is filled with shiny surfaces and detailed aircraft, and there’s something a little sad in how the new version of the Mall level now looks abandoned, with its stores boarded up. You can revisit your past, I guess, but things will have changed. I don’t remember drones from my original runs through Downhill Jam, that’s for sure. Tony himself looks older, and maybe a little creakier, although his voice-over during the tutorials is infectious in its enthusiasm. Look at the cool stuff you can do, every emphasis seems to say, just look at it all! Learn a few tricks, and the world is yours!There are nods to modern sensibilities here, though. The roster of skaters is notably more diverse. A trick has been renamed to address an ableist term and bring attention to the trick’s creator, and there are a range of assists you can turn on if you don’t want to worry about running out of your special meter, or never want to bail. Every park is unlocked to be played in free skate from the beginning of the game, and there’s a new Speed Run mode that tests to see how quickly you can finish every goal in each level. The developer, Vicarious Visions, was wise enough to avoid being precious with the content, bringing more advanced moves like manuals to the first game, while also allowing you to turn those options off if you’d like — along with assists so that you’ll never wipe out or lose your balance on grinds — to keep the classical experience. The most competitive players will never touch those settings anyway, or maybe they’ll just never find them in the inelegant menu system — for real, the menus are a mess — but newer players or those who struggle with manual dexterity will be glad they’re there. It’s been a joy watching my children fall in love with this game by going through the tutorials, exploring each park in free skate, and learning tricks with the virtual training wheels on. It’s 2020, and Tony Hawk and his virtual counterparts are still out here, spreading the gospel of skateboarding. Which is worth spreading, especially in this form. I took to the first level of the first game in this collection as if no time at all had passed since I played it in high school. I slipped right into that same blissful state as I explored levels, reveled in secrets, and enjoyed existing in a world where the only “No Skating” signs existed to be destroyed in pursuit of your goals. The first two Tony Hawk games were created before the series had story modes or sections in which your character got off the board. Even now, the levels explode with an aggressive ferocity filtered through elegant, versatile design that rewards players who go straight for each objective, while also holding surprises for fans trying to think outside the box.  Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 and 2 are the sorts of games you just couldn’t make anymore. The concept doesn’t really support ongoing content, as Activision found out by watering down what made the game special with sequel after sequel, year after year. That’s why the franchise was always doomed; it wasn’t an idea that did well as different teams bolted on more and more gimmicks and oddities.But that only makes this remaster feel more miraculous — an act of driving through your old neighborhood to see what’s changed, back when a few skate parks and some inventive inside jokes were enough to support a full-priced release. No one would fund such a modest endeavor anymore; there’s no good way to add a season pass to Pro Skater, or fund continual development through selling skins. It always worked better as timed runs through limited environments, not as an open-world game with various missions to find and complete. The series, when done well, is almost the opposite of a living game, which is a pretty punk-rock thing to be in 2020. The soundtrack is still expertly selected, with enough of the classic songs included to bring older players back to their youth. The game’s controls and combo systems hew close enough to the originals that my old muscle memory kicked in immediately. I’ve still not unlocked every park, and I suspect there are more new secrets that I haven’t seen in the levels I have played, but the amount of content is almost beside the point. Once I’ve mastered the game, as I originally did in my youth, I’ll likely return to it again and again, trying to improve my strategies and losing myself in the mechanical beauty of the level design and controls. Online play — which we haven’t tried before the public launch — plus the ability to create and share your own skate parks, the create-a-skater mode, and even couch co-op will also help keep this game active in my library for a long time to come. I’m also looking forward to seeing the secret skaters that have been hidden in this release. After a few hours, I even got the same dull ache in the same parts of my hands, the parts that most other games don’t tax quite so severely as Tony Hawk’s games do. Everything I love about the original is still here; it’s just a little older, a little kinder, and a lot better looking.Just like Tony Hawk himself. Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 and 2 will be released Sept. 4 on PlayStation 4, Windows PC, and Xbox One. The game was played on Xbox One using a physical copy provided by Activision.

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2,Ian Walker,Kotaku,https://kotaku.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-the-kotaku-review-1844937925,"Let’s just get this out of the way: Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2 is a masterpiece. In perfectly mimicking the iconic skateboarding series’ first two outings, this remaster gives me everything I could ever want out of a game. I am dumbfounded by there somehow being something so good and pure in the world.I first played Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater, like many did, as a kid frustrated with the complexities of real skateboarding in the early 2000s. After hours of fighting with my terrible body to just do an ollie—please, why is this so hard—it felt nice to boot up a game where the foundational trick could be performed with a single button. I kickflipped over massive halfpipes. I slid along the blades of a helicopter. I marveled at the unlockable Rodney Mullen videos. I sang along to Rage Against the Machine’s “Guerrilla Radio,” music that would have never been allowed in my house otherwise.As you might imagine, I had high hopes for Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2—which we’ll call THPS1+2 from now on because that name is way too unwieldy. We haven’t had a good Tony Hawk game for a decade or more, depending on who you ask. Frankly, I haven’t been all that impressed with the series since Tony Hawk’s Underground took up a near-permanent residence in my GameCube in late 2003, and none have reached the impeccable heights of 2000 follow-up Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 2.The idea of one of my favorite games of all time getting dolled up for a date with modern consoles was a dream come true. Thankfully, Vicarious Visions nailed it with THPS1+2. Since getting my hands on the excellent Warehouse demo last month, I’ve been in awe of the way the studio almost perfectly replicated the mechanics of the original games. While there’s a detailed tutorial to get newcomers and veterans up to speed, muscle memory took over almost immediately. I had no problem quickly busting out huge combos—well, huge for me—and completing objectives in the full game.$70 off these best-in-class wireless headphonesGizmodo reviewed them and declared them to be “annoyingly incredible.""THPS1+2 also features a host of smaller changes that makes it that much better. Mechanics from later games, like manuals, reverts, and spine transfers, have been added to the basics, opening up additional scoring opportunities in levels where they weren’t previously available. New challenges extend the amount of time you spend in each stage. Heck, you can even press in the right control stick to skip the current song if you’re just not feeling it. I also appreciated that the music is consistent, which means that restarting a run to get a trick or challenge down just right won’t result in a hitching, skipping soundtrack.""Turn that shit up.""Skateboarding simulatorReverence for everything that made the originals specials, upgraded visuals, new skaters.Tricky camera.Vicarious VisionsPlayStation 4, Xbox One (played), PCSeptember 4, 2020100% completed both campaigns.That said, THPS1+2 is mostly the same game—or games, I guess. The levels, while much prettier this time around, are so close to perfect that I couldn’t pick out any major changes. Secret areas are still unlocked in the same way, such as grinding the helicopter in Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 2’s Hangar level. I was even able to use decades-old guides when I couldn’t remember where the next letter in S-K-A-T-E or a secret video tape was hidden. It was like returning to a childhood home and being awash in nostalgia, general details eventually giving way to meticulous memories.There are very few gaming experiences like Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater these days. Skateboarding games have only grown more and more complex. And while there’s certainly a place for projects like Skate and Session, which offer a more realistic take on the extreme sport, they’re never quite as satisfying as the series that started it all. Even with all its changes, THPS1+2 perfectly captures a moment in time. It’s a damaged Polaroid photo scanned, digitized, and lovingly retouched. It’s gravel picked out of a scraped knee. It’s a good night’s rest, untouched by nightmares and insomnia. It is, as it always was, exactly what I need right now. "

Paul Tamburro 
Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 review for PS4, Xbox One, and PC. Skating down the Warehouse’s first ramp, smashing through its glass doors, and then performing a picture-perfect Christ Air soundtracked by ‘Guerrilla Radio’ is a transportive experience. THPS 1+2 is a time capsule teleported in from the ’90s, taking me back to weekends spent ollying and grinding virtual rails with my friends. It sends me back to a time when baggy jeans came equipped with metal chains, and when people willingly listened to Goldfinger. It’s a blast from the past, but it doesn’t coast by on nostalgia alone — this is one of the most comprehensive and thoughtful remakes yet.THPS 1+2 combines the original Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater and its sequel in a collection spanning all skate parks from the two games, faithfully recreating every collectible, ramp, and halfpipe featured in the originals. But rather than giving these old classics a mere fresh lick of paint a la Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater HD, developer Vicarious Visions has brought the series up to date, making it a more exhilarating experience than ever before.Playing THPS 1+2 is like replaying the old Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater games but as you remember them with the benefit of rose-tinted glasses. Gone are the blocky polygonal skaters and foggy draw distances, replaced by colorful and well-lit arenas, 4K visuals, and a frame rate of up to 144 FPS on PC. Old parks like Warehouse and School have the same layout as they did back in the day, though they look distinctly better than their 1999 and 2000 counterparts, and more fluid gameplay makes them even more of a joy to zip around in 2020.There’s nothing more satisfying than chaining together special moves across the entirety of a park, watching your combo meter fill up as you fling your skater from halfpipe to rail, seeing through the Matrix as you start to notice how certain objects and surfaces in a park can be used to maximize your score. However, you don’t necessarily need to be good at THPS 1+2 to enjoy it — this is a game that is mindful of its more “casual” players, allowing them to enable a bunch of game mods such as perfect rail, manual, and lip balance to make things easier.Like its predecessors, THPS 1+2 also isn’t concerned about realism. A game where you can skate through Roswell and kickflip past a UFO unsurprisingly doesn’t care too much about emulating real-world physics, so while the tricks you can pull off are the same as the pros’, the tremendous speed and momentum you can gain allows you to pull off ludicrous moves and ridiculous combos.These combos can be increased by using your special moves, which can be activated once you’ve filled up your special meter. You start off with five special move slots and can unlock more as you progress, with each move being interchangeable. Some moves, like the daring 900, are more difficult to pull off and therefore grant you more points, while others are less tricky though will reward you fewer points in the process. These moves are pulled off using specific button presses or analog stick twirls similar to a fighting game, and the variety on offer here allows you to experiment with the best moves that suit your play style.Vicarious Visions know how to thrust an old series back into the public eye after developing the hugely successful Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy. But unlike the Crash trilogy, which controversially altered the platforming of the original games, the changes made to THPS 1+2 are all for the better. Wall plants and wallrides can be performed across all parks, allowing you to rack up staggeringly high combos and embrace these classic stages in brand new ways, while more objectives have been added to the original Pro Skater‘s levels to add even more things to do.These objectives are completable in the single-player Skate Tours mode, running the gamut from collecting the letters S-K-A-T-E, to making particularly difficult jumps, to performing location-specific objectives such as collecting school textbooks or ollying over parked cars. Completing these objectives opens up new parks in Skate Tours, though you can still access the parks in a separate mode that allows you to free skate or compete in single sessions with global online leaderboards.Extra challenges and an abundance of unlockable cosmetics also give a great incentive to keep playing, with these challenges letting you rack up cash that you can then spend on apparel, boards, and more using the in-game store. There are no microtransactions at the time of this review, so all items are unlocked by old-fashioned gameplay, and THPS 1+2 is all the better for it. The cosmetics look great, with many licensed brands allowing you to deck out your custom created skater in a variety of fashions, while there are also unlockable outfits for the pro skaters included in its lineup.As if it didn’t already have enough to sink your teeth into, THPS 1+2 also features online and local multiplayer. The former allows you to jump in a park with 7 other players and compete in a variety of casual or ranked challenges, while the latter lets you take on a friend in classic modes such as Graffiti, Trick Attack, and Horse. Unfortunately, there’s no option to play in private lobbies with friends, though Vicarious Visions has stated this will come to the game in a future update.Create-a-park also makes its return, allowing you to create custom parks and upload them for others to experience. The tools at your disposal are robust and intuitive, with you also able to buy additional scenery, ramps, and more with the in-game store. Vicarious Visions also has a bunch of its own created parks to play highlighting just what you can do with the mode, from creating rollercoasters to skate parks located inside giant pyramids.There’s so much to do in THPS 1+2, yet I could spend hours just perfecting my score on one small section on one of its parks. It’s the ultimate game for high score chasers, forcing you to unwittingly adopt a speedrunners’ mentality and see each wall, hill, and rail as another opportunity for a jaw-dropping combo.From its innumerable challenges to its tough objectives and extensive customization options, it’s designed from the ground up to leave you always wanting just one more go. But, as any veteran Pro Skater player will tell you, one more go will always result in you awake until 4 AM, still trying to get the perfect run on Downhill Jam.Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2 is a triumphant return for the series and makes a strong claim for the best skateboarding game ever. It’s a must-play for fans of the series and newcomers alike, and I hope this isn’t the last Pro Skater game we see from Vicarious Visions.Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2 was reviewed using a PC review code provided by the publisher.10Paul Tamburro is the Editor-in-Chief of GameRevolution and PlayStation LifeStyle, and as such is also the final boss.

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2,Chris Carter,Destructoid,https://www.destructoid.com/stories/review-tony-hawk-s-pro-skater-1-2-600791.phtml,"darkTony Hawk’s Pro Skater left its mark on history…I want to say…within minutes of its release in 1999.It didn’t matter if you skated or not, it was a cultural touchstone, a sign that skating had arrived. While it’s faltered through the years (Tony Hawk himself dates it around 2006, when Project 8 was released), it’s back now: for real this time.Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 (PC, PS4 [reviewed], Xbox One)Developer: Vicarious VisionsPublisher: ActivisionReleased: September 4, 2020MSRP: $39.99This isn’t the same mistake of a release that Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater HD was in 2012.Split-screen is back, as well as the ability to create-a-skater or lead a selection of pros through a campaign mode that spans the first two games; without the need for DLC or post-launch updates. The other key to the kingdom: it was genius to reintroduce the wall plant, transfer, revert, and manual concepts all at once. As you can see in the trick videos so far a hell of a lot is possible, as the mechanical inner workings of 1 + 2 were not hamstrung out of the gate.That attention to detail is the crux of what Vicarious Visions was able to pull off. Keep it simple on the surface, but complex under the hood. Outside of a few instances every so often where it feels like my skater didn’t quite land how they should have (which could use some post-game patches to shore up), it’s very similar to the old games, but with a framework that allows a lot more combo potential.And what would a Tony Hawk game be without a killer soundtrack? The tracklist is available here to inspect, and suffice to say most of the classic songs from the first two games are intact. It’s all subjective at the end of the day, but I turned off a lot of the new ones out of preference. Thankfully, the entire jukebox feature is customizable, and the R3 button instantly switches tracks even mid-game. “Little upgrades” are a running theme with this version.As far as modes go, this re-release is dead simple — to the point where the lack of fanfare might leave you underwhelmed. The campaign consists of nine Tony Hawk 1 levels, eight standard Tony Hawk 2 stages (with a final Chopper Drop unlock and a secret level), and the ability to free skate or score-attack all of those stages in free play. You can also create-your-own park (or play with a few of Vicarious’ brews) and play offline (split-screen) or online multiplayer.That’s basically it. You’ll skate your way through each stage completing classic objectives — high score, collect the S-K-A-T-E letters, grab the secret tape, and other scavenger hunt-like stuff — and finishing enough of them unlocks the following stage. There aren’t any elaborate new cutscenes or a story, really: even if you create and customize your own skater. The overarching game does have challenges and plenty of [in-game] cosmetics to peruse and buy though, if you’re hell-bent on getting a true 100% completion rating. This “level-up” throughput also unlocks extra content and more custom trick slots.You can even use the same old school guides if you want for the most part (a few things have been added to the original campaign)! It’s all straight drop-in and go, arcade style. There’s a ton of classics here: Mall, School II, Venice Beach, all of which elicit fond memories as I forge new ones with the new visual style. It was a joy to replay all of them again, trying to remember where all of the well-hidden gap challenges were and seeing everything in another light. The first two games are a powerhouse in terms of playgrounds to mess around in and try to find the best combo lines, so it’s no surprise that they still withstand the test of time. Some stages are more touched-up than others, but as a whole everything looks cleaner and smoother than it did with the prior HD release.I do have to say though: this could have used some Tony Hawk 3 levels, even just for the sake of longevity. It didn’t occur to me until replaying the entire series a few years back that the third entry low key had some of the best stages in the franchise, packed with more goal variety. The team could have added a bit of that panache to some of the smaller-scale areas of Tony Hawk 1 + 2, for those of you out there who don’t want to chase high scores or online leaderboards. As a small concession, you do get a few cute cheat codes and visual toggles for 100%-ing each campaign.I’m harping on replay value a tad here because while split-screen is a boon, it’s not perfect. Available for up to two players (Free Skate, Trick Attack, Score Challenge, Combo Mambo, Combo Challenge, Tag, Graffiti, H-O-R-S-E), the mode takes a framerate hit, even in gametypes where only one person is on the screen at a time. I’m glad it exists in any form, flawed or not; but don’t expect to be able to jump into it and have it run flawlessly.Blemishes aside, Activision is doing so much right this time beyond just putting Vicarious Visions in charge. Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 isn’t going to blow people away, but it preserves the original experience with a few modern conveniences. It’s a win.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher, with a focus on local play.]GreatImpressive efforts with a few noticeable problems holding them back. Won't astound everyone, but is worth your time and cash.

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2,Erik Kain,Forbes,https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2020/09/04/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1--2-remake-review-all-tricked-out/#20c2ae6b7655,"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 remake is fantastic in every way, and true to the original.There was a moment when I was skating around in the remaster of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 when my 13-year-old daughter came into the room and said “So you just get to skate around at a skate park and do tricks?”“Pretty much,” I said.“That’s amazing,” she said, looking genuinely in awe of this simple yet brilliant concept. She’s been learning how to skateboard and she’s gotten pretty good at it, but she’s not doing tricks yet. Well, here’s one way to do that without worrying about bailing. Or without me worrying about her breaking an ankle, at least.I have missed the old Tony Hawk games. Back in the day, these were some of my favorites. I was pretty good back then, too. Not great, but I could string a few tricks together and complete enough challenges to unlock the next map. My friends and I would trade off controllers and play for hours (if we weren’t playing Halo).There’s been a void in the skating genre since the first few Tony Hawk games. Nothing has really lived up to my expectations in the intervening years. And now, 20 years later, thanks to the talent and hard work over at Vicarious Visions, we have both the first two games completely remade from the ground up and they’re glorious.What’s not to love?You have a bunch of skaters to choose from or you can custom design your own. Completing challenges earns you in-game cash you can spend on apparel, board designs and so forth. The tutorial (courtesy of Tony Hawk) teaches you everything you need to know (or gives you a solid refresher, if you’re super rusty like me).The graphics are completely modernized and the game looks great, tapping into that nostalgia vein hard with a largely intact soundtrack filled with glorious 90s jams from bands like Goldfinger, Rage Against The Machine and Primus (plus 37 new additions).The game bundles both Tony Hawk 1 and 2 and you can tackle either/or to complete challenges in timed sessions, unlocking maps as you go, or just hop into free skate to practice tricks. Whether you’re into skateboarding or not, it’s a blast. You don’t need to have any interest in skating culture or any experience actually on a board to enjoy racking up points, pulling off wicked combos or unleashing sweet special moves, all while listening to fun music in gorgeously remade tracks from Phoenix, AZ to Marseilles, France.There are some old games out there that I’ve always hoped would make a comeback. Some have already, like Wonder Boy: The Dragon’s Trap. Others remain on the shelf, like the old NES game Ice Hockey. For a long time I hoped that we’d get a remake of Tony Hawk 1 and 2 (and 3 and 4), rather than the super disappointing newer releases like Tony Hawk 5, and now we have it and it’s basically all that I hoped for.The levels themselves are essentially 1:1 remakes of the original tracks, but the level of detail and graphical fidelity is just insane. (Frankly, I felt like the original games looked amazing back in the day, but that’s how brains work I guess. Watch some side-by-side comparisons to see just how far we’ve come). Nostalgia is key in Vicarious Vision’s design. You feel like you’re right back on the old tracks you loved back in the day. They just look way, way better now.In terms of mechanics, having not played the originals in so many years, I can’t say with certainty how loyal the game is to the controls. We’re using newer gamepads now, but other than that it feels exactly as good as it did back in the day and probably better (I had to change the default inverted controls, however).The skating is as tight as ever. Pulling off tricks takes practice and skill, but you’re not hampered by clunky controls. It’s a smooth ride from start to finish. You will bail plenty, but you’ll be grinding out five-trick combos in no time if you stick with it.Which you should, whether or not you skate or played these back in the day. The nostalgia is strong with this one, but not a necessary component. Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 is just plain, good old-fashioned arcade fun. I think we could all use a healthy dose of that right now.Other cool stuff:Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 RemakePlatform: PS4 (reviewed), Xbox One, PC (Epic Game Store)Publisher: ActivisionDeveloper: Vicarious VisionsCost: $39.99 (standard), $49.99 (deluxe)Score: 9.5/10A review code was provided for the purposes of this review."
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2,Asif Khan,Shacknews,https://www.shacknews.com/article/120260/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-review-welcome-back-to-the-9-club-bro,"New to Shacknews? Signup for a Free AccountAlready have an account? Login NowTony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 is out now, and the king may now reclaim his skateboarding video game throne. How good is the game? Our review. Skateboarding may not be as popular of a sport as it was in the late 1990s or early 2000s, but skating will always hold a special place in my heart. The same is true for the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater franchise, which really dominated the world for a period of time around the turn of the century. Like many good video games, it was released and iterated upon over and over again until what remained was not so great. In fact, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 received a 1/10 rating making it the lowest-rated game ever reviewed on Shacknews. Times have changed, developers have folded, and a new era of the THPS franchise is upon us with a remake from Vicarious Visions. Tony's Hawks's Pro Skater 1+2 brings together the first two games in the series in an amazing package that is nothing short of outstanding. Find out more about why this game deserves to join your library in our review.Tony Hawk is one of the most popular skateboarders of all-time, and his video game franchise was the gold standard in skating games for many years. With Tony Hawk's 1+2, a whole new generation of players will get to witness the magic that was the early era of THPS games. Tony, Chad Muska, Rodney Mullen, and even Bob Burnquist are all back in THPS 1+2 and they are joined by a new cast of modern skaters including Nyjah Huston and Riley Hawk.If you aren't feeling any of these skaters that come with the game, THPS 1+2 has a Create-a-Skater feature that allows players to create a playable character that will work in both online multiplayer and single player game modes. I created my good old avatar Earl Divx, who has most recently been seen in Animal Crossing: New Horizons and on the sidelines coaching in NCAA Football 13. It's a little thing, but being able to recreate my old skater from the 90s really cranked up the nostalgia. He may be a bit more gray than last time he was on a board, but he was back to doing handstand manuals after a few days of grinding for Stat Points. THPS 1+2 brings players back to the classic levels of the franchise's first two games, but with a twist. Players have a new moveset that incorporates a lot of the innovations of THPS 2 and 3. Now players are able to chain together combos off of vert ramps with reverts and manuals in ways that were never possible in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. The gameplay mechanics are damn near perfect, but I did notice that some of the THPS 1 levels don't really take advantage of the modern moveset as easily. This is likely because the levels were designed before the gameplay mechanics were created. It may be a tiny gripe, but it is worth pointing out. To be honest, there weren't that many good levels in the first THPS, and that is still true in 2020 even with a new moveset and coat of paint.While many of the first THPS levels weren't that exciting for me to return to, THPS 2 is a completely different story. My playthrough of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 really perked up once I made my way into the THPS 2 levels. There are some certifiable bangers of levels in this package, from Venice, Skatestreet, and even the Bullring. THPS 2 levels are just better and that is still the case in 2020. The levels also hold up very well with the new moveset as they were designed with manual tricks in mind, unlike the game's first installment. Players who want the original experience of each game are able to change the moveset to THPS 1 or 2 in the settings, allowing for even more challenging playthroughs of the game. This game is already teeming with replay value, and little features like this really go a long way to make THPS 1+2 even more fun to play over and over again.The soundtracks for the original Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 were outstanding, and Vicarious Visions has done a great job of putting everyone back together with some new tracks too. Players who want a traditional soundtrack experience will have to go in and remove tracks one by one until you reach playlist nirvana. In a total surprise, Anthrax and Public Enemy's Bring the Noise song is featured in the THPS 1+2 soundtrack even after the developers said the track would be omitted. This was a pleasant surprise, but there are some things about the game's audio design that made my celebration very short-lived.When a player bails, falls down and the trick or combo fails, the game plays a video tape rewinding sound effect and the skater gets all pixelated as they get back on the board. This plays over the music, and is pretty jarring when it happens. It seems like the developers really went ham with making the sound effects in the game extra video-gamey. When a player successfully chains together enough tricks in a combo to get their Special Meter completely full, the game adds a sort of echoy reverb effect to the music. I think this was done to make the Special Tricks feel more epic, but it sort of sucks the energy out of the run because you literally can't hear the music as well.I would also argue that the changes made to the bail mechanic have made THPS 1+2 a less punishing game than the original titles, as bailing doesn't always end with your skater on the ground with bumps and bruises. Many times a failed trick is barely penalized as skaters just jump back on their boards. This is a bit unrealistic and it removes some of those hilarious ragdoll accidents that would happen back in the day. Many of the design decisions were probably made in the interest of making the game more accessible to players, but it bothered me as a grizzled, old veteran of the franchise.Vicarious Visions has a masterpiece on their hands with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2. They handled the remake of theses games with the right amount of reverance while still leaving their own signature on the work. THPS 1+2 combines awesome gameplay mechanics, impressive graphics, and an outstanding soundtrack in a complete package of skateboarding greatness. Some modes like the online multiplayer function could use more work, but the game makes up for any minor shortcomings with the overwhelming amount of things that are done just right. From nods to past versions of the game, to the pixel-for-pixel remakes of each iconic level, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 is one of the best games to be released in all of 2020. Congratulations to Vicarious Visions! I can only hope that the studio will be allowed to release a THPS 3+4 on the way to creating a brand new THPS 6 experience with the great framework that they have built here. Welcome back to The 9 Club, Tony.

					Asif Khan posted a new article, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 review: Welcome back to The 9 Club, bro 
					Yeah I need to buy this. Great write-up!				
					I've put about 10 hours into it so far and I'm loving it. Fantastic update of a classic. 				
					This game scratches a serious nostalgia itch. I ended up turning off the music and using a Spotify playlist,https://open.spotify.com/playlist/205IusVHEgJE8LREEr0woC 
					Game is seriously great if you’re a fan of the original.  I’ve always sucked at THPS games, but loved them anyway, and this package does a great job of refreshing the look of the game while keeping the gameplay intact.  				
					Yeah I love that it retcons mechanics into the game that weren't even in 1 & 2 like reverts.  I probably played THPS3 more than any of the other ones and playing this was like riding that bike again, although I am kind of disappointed that there aren't any THPS3 levels in the game... like I would have preferred the game being THPS 2+3 rather than 1+2 but I'm guessing based off the success of this game they'll release a 3+4 eventually or something.				
					Yeah I'm hoping there's a 3+4 too. It'd make for a good time.   I really gotta learn how not to suck at this game though. I know what I'm supposed to do, but I'm a klutz.  :( 				
					Would you want a separate 3+4 release or dlc add-ons / expansions for this one?The mechanics are already in there and the pricing is already such that $20 for a pack with each game would be reasonable. I think it would be great if they continue to fill this one out with as much THPS as they can, but a wholly separate release would probably sell more.Maybe they could do both, and with 3+4 offer the THPS 1+2 content as optional add-ons for those that skipped it. Win-win. Where are my royalties, Activision? 
					Woot. Was waiting for this review from the Asif man. It’s probably the best remake of all time imo. I picked it up, dusted off 18 years of rust and it was like riding a bike. It truly feels like the originals but with less floaty hang time. I finished everything now I’m just working on challenges and getting platinum in each level.  "
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2,Dom Peppiatt,VG247,https://www.vg247.com/2020/09/03/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-review/,"It’s official, Vicarious Visions can bottle nostalgia. With Crash Bandicoot N Sane Trilogy, the developer demonstrated a knack for hoisting your nostalgia up from the cortex and making a game look and feel as good as you remembered. With Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2, the studio has proved revitalising these dead franchises is nothing short of an art.From the second you kick yourself down the roll-in on the first, iconic Warehouse level – a level no doubt burned into the mind of many gamers from a very special demo disc – the game feels right. Like you remember. Every twitch kickflip, every strained ollie, every desperate wallplant you nail when you’re trying to extend your combo for those vital multipliers; it’s all there, brilliantly lit in HDR, testing your reflexes in 60FPS.Vicarious Visions has managed to salvage Neversoft’s old code and import it into the new engine and that shows, because the game is almost uncannily similar to what you remember. Muscle memory that’s been dead some 20 years will wake up in your hands, and you’ll be a slave to its undead twitching.It’s nothing short of a miracle, really. Other developers have tried, and failed miserably, to rebottle the magic that made the Tony Hawk Pro Skater series so enduring. Remasters previously have failed to get the speed just right, underestimated how important the collision physics are, and fumbled the tough-but-fair conditions that make you bail and eat shit. Other games, like the ill-fated Skater XL, have leaned too far into getting the feel of skating right; they’ve relied on realism over good game design.Vicarious Visions' interpretation of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater somehow manages to reflect your rose-tinted glasses of the originals in every facet. The street art plastered on every conceivable surface pops out of your TV thanks to the new engine, the cu-cump-cu-cump-cu-cump of wheels on paving stones rumbles through the floor and the slap of wood on coping when you land a trick echoes like it would under any concrete overpass. Look back at either game running on PSOne and you see how nasty and blocky it looked – Vicarious Visions has made this game look, feel and sound as good as you think it deserves to be. And that’s no mean feat.Perhaps the biggest achievement, though, is in how the remaster nails the risk/reward balance. Similarly to the original games, your session lives and dies on whether or not you can execute lengthy combos chaining grinds, grabs, flips and lip tricks. Unlike the original, you can now also revert and manual - so knowing when to give up on a combo versus when to push it just a bit more to get those delicious points. And that's as moreish as ever. The game helps you out way more than its genre rivals do. In Skate, Skater XL or Session, your deck doesn’t magically magnetise to the nearest rail or let you off if your (greedily gotten) Madonna isn’t quite finished by the time you hit the vert ramp. This remaster seems to know just when to slam your skater to the floor and just when to let you off – whatever developmental necromancy the studio has used to determine how to measure ‘fairness’ should probably be banished to another realm. It’s too good. 
 
Similarly to the originals, this arcade leniency makes the games feel more accessible – and why not? That’s the whole appeal; chasing high scores, having it out with your mates over a six-pack, running session after session to complete every bastard objective in Downhill Jam. The score chasing, the sometimes obscure objectives and even a few new devilish collectibles from Vicarious Visions itself are all in there. The studio has gone above and beyond on a clear labour of love.The skill in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater comes from knowing how to knit tricks together and weave ludicrous looking moves in and out of the geometry in front of you. Can you noseblunt up to that big gap, kick a triple Impossible off the jump, land into a manual and drop into a nearby vert ramp to carry your combo on? Or are you better just going for some mad 900-degree spin whilst sacktapping yourself to celibacy to try and rack up bigger points in a shorter time? Experience, knowing your skater, and occasional blind luck will determine what works – and luckily you’ve got 17 (mostly) fun levels to learn all that in. 
 
You may come to this game already knowing it’s good (we’ve had a whole Warehouse Demo to prove that), but aside from the ample portion the two games themselves serve up, you’ve still got more to chew on. The Create-A-Park mode is fairly robust, and though it can be clunky to master on a control pad, the suite of tools, props and templates available to you is enough to satiate even the sniffiest skatepark architect. Whether you’re trying to make a ramp-for-ramp replica of Victoria Park Skate Park (it’s very tough!) or making some sort of gimmicky, Powerslave-inspired madhouse, Create-a-Park has you covered.If you just want to stick to the asphalt and concrete, don’t fret; with 24 skaters (once you unlock the secret ones) and a swathe of challenges specifically for the four Create-A-Skater slots, you’re not going to finish everything this game has to offer in a hurry. For this review, we clocked up over 20 hours of gameplay and we’ve barely scratched the surface of two pro skaters and the Create-a-Skater suites. That’s 21 more sets of Challenges, a lot of them custom, to go.  
 
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 treads a great balance between the aesthetic of both games, too. You’re going to be thrashing out all your sessions to the same set of tracks, and whilst a lot of the original soundtrack is present, there are some additions, too. Mostly, it’s on the level – we’ve got equal measures of ska (for better or for worse) and hardcore stuff, mixed in with hip-hop, grime and rap. The latter genres definitely fall in line with THPS2’s less guitar-based setup, and I’ve already come away from the game with Spotify playlists brimming with new stuff to listen to. So whoever was in charge of the music licensing has already fulfilled their brief, to an extent. Though going from Skepta to Reel Big Fish is never going to feel right.This, really, is the complete package: at once the dirt under the fingernails and a celebration of what skating is in 2020. The old guard – Hawk, Mullen, Muska, Burnquist et al – are joined by sensational newcomers like Aori Nishimura, Leticia Bufoni, and Leo Baker: accurately reflecting the influx of female and non-binary personalities on the scene and how open skating is to everyone in the modern age.Vicarious Visions has proved that Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater was more than just a product of its time, and that – like skating itself – it has every chance of penetrating the mainstream once again. The studio should be lauded for twice proving that it is a steward of 90s nostalgia, and that it can reanimate games to be just as good – if not better! – for their second turn under the sun.Version tested: PS4.

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2,Sean Smith,God is a Geek,https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-switch-review/,"June 25, 2021When Neversoft dropped their landmark original Tony Hawk classic, I was a hard-partying punk not averse to a bit of skating. In 2021, skateboarding is about to be represented at the Olympic games. Jonah Hill’s astonishing Mid90s is still fresh in my mind. And finally I can play a proper fully 3D Hawk’s whilst sat on the khazi. What a time to be alive.The recent mainline console versions were incredible. And I am pleased to report that in terms of the exceptional gameplay, addictiveness, content and feelgood factor, the Switch port does not disappoint. All of the content is present and correct from the other versions. In fact, apart from a bit of blur here and there, and some muddy textures, the locked to 30fps visuals are perfectly palatable on the less powerful hardware. Although it does look much sharper on the handheld screen.Playing the splendidly remastered parks of yore brings back an instant pang of nostalgia. I was transported back to being glued to my PS1, gleefully pulling off an ollie with Spider-Man. The Marvel license, borne of Neversoft’s fantastic Hawk-engine-employing Spidey game, doesn’t make it over this time. But plenty of new and cool stuff does.The soundtrack, already teeming with all-time-classic bangers from Fu Manchu, Anthrax & Public Enemy and just about every skate-punk outfit worth their salt at the time, is bolstered in 2021 by the likes of FIDLAR, Viagra Boys, UK grime rapper Skepta and the excellently named Merkules. The choices are all superb and well in keeping with the feel of the original. They have even thrown in a bit of vintage Tribe Called Quest, further cementing the nostalgia for us elderly skaters. The warm, wholesome blend of old and new is furthered by the mix of recognisable skaters from back in the day being joined by a diverse set of newcomers. So you will find Steve Caballero rubbing up alongside Leo Baker. Look hard enough and you may even find old nemesis Officer Dick!Controlling your moveset has been mixed up to include transitional manoeuvres from across the entire Tony Hawk’s run. Being able to pull off lengthy combos has never been easier. This is thanks to being able to use wall plants, reverts and other canny fare to get the most out of you and your board. If these new additions go against the grain for PS1 heads, then there is an option to stick with the original moveset and play that way. There’s a lengthy, but extremely fun tutorial. This in itself has plenty of reply value to constantly remind you of what you can do, and re-evaluate your skills. It’s a great place to start. But once you get out there into the parks the real fun begins, as the short bursts of super-addictive carnage prove as compulsive as ever. Having this on the go makes it somehow even more of a treat. I have found myself picking up a quick fifteen minutes between footy fixtures. Or on breaks at work, and any other time I can get some peace to go hunting for cassettes, out-grind myself, or build another crazy skatepark using the create mode.Given the wealth of positives, the only genuine downer I can put on the Switch port is the fault of the hardware itself. As can quite often be the case, the analogue sticks and button layout aren’t the best or the most responsive tools for the job. You would probably be better off using a Pro Controller to get the very best out of your skate experience.But this is a small gripe. This is a superb port of one of the finest arcade sports experiences of them all. And it instantly becomes an essential purchase for Switch owners.Great time honoured Hawk gameplay
All the content from the big boysSome muddy textures and blurring
Controls can be fiddlyThis is a superb port of one of the finest arcade sports experiences of them all, and instantly becomes an essential purchase for Switch owners.

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2,Dean James,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-review/,"The introduction to 3D with the PlayStation and Nintendo 64 was a very interesting era for the gaming industry, with many now iconic franchises starting their humble beginnings during that time. Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater was definitely one of those series that seemingly came out of nowhere and blew up overnight before dying out years later. An abysmal attempt to revive the series was made back in 2015, which put the brand in even worse shape than it was before. Rather than attempt a brand new entry at this point, Activision decided to go to their recent bread and butter following a string of successful remakes with the newly remastered Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2.Just as the title of the game indicates, this game features a remaster of both Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 and Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 2 that originally released in 1999 and 2000 respectively. Each of the games were quite similar to one another back then, which makes them a natural fit to be remastered together. Rather than combining the two into one long experience, this release still keeps them separated, but now they are each known as separate Tours in the game that are selected from the game’s main menu.From the Tours menu, you get to choose between playing the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater Tour, the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 2 Tour, or the Ranked & Free Skate Tour. Picking the first game will thrust you right into familiar territory for anyone that has played the original before, as you start off right in the series’ most iconic stage, the Warehouse. Regardless of whether you start the first or second game, you will immediately notice a major improvement on the original, which are the addition of more Challenge Tapes that are now known as Park Goals.Outside of just skating for points, which is the singular purpose of the Ranked & Free Skate Tour, Challenge Tapes were the tasks you had to complete in each level that would then help you to unlock additional levels. Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 builds upon this idea by doubling the number of goals that you have within each stage. Every one of the regular stages has six set Park Goals, which include getting a High Score, Pro Score, Sick Score, High Combo, collecting the S-K-A-T-E letters, and finding the secret tape. There were always two score tapes, the letters tape, and the secret tape along with a level exclusive one as well in the past, but now there are four level exclusive Park Goals per stage, which means you will have to do a lot more exploring of the different stages than in the past.While not classified as a remake like Vicarious Visions’ recent Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 almost feels like one in how much better it looks visually. All of the stages have the same layout as the original games, but now with a major facelift that makes it feel like a modern release. There were definitely some texture issues with loading here and there, but the speed that you are typically skating around at shouldn’t have you staring at one particular area for too long. This enhanced level of detail also really helps with some of the previously mentioned new goals that probably could not have been pulled off in the original games.The visuals were not the only aspect of the game to be modernized, as the controls were updated as well. For the most part, the controls feel just as tight and precise as they did in the original two games, but the big addition here was that of Revert. This technique wasn’t added to the series until Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3, with it serving as an excellent way to continue your combos and increase that score multiplier. This is built right into the new controls, but you can also go into the menu options and switch specifically to classic controls for either of the first two games if you want. However, the addition of Revert without a doubt makes the gameplay better and the default control scheme is going to give you the best overall experience.The addition of Revert without a doubt makes the gameplay betterTony Hawk may be the titular athlete for the series, but he is far from the only skater that you can use in the game. Not including the pre-order bonus or unlockable skaters, there are 21 total real life skaters to choose from at the start in the game. On top of that, you also have the ability to create a custom skater as in the past. Regardless of the character you choose though, you are able to upgrade them over time by playing with them and finding Stat Points in each level. With these Stat Points, you can upgrade stats like Speed, Rail Balance, and Hangtime, with you even able to re-spec them anytime you want. Unfortunately, the Stat Points are not shared across each skater, so you will have to start from scratch if you want to switch skaters. This can definitely be a bit frustrating if you wanted to create your own skater later or just change to another one, as you essentially need to pick one from the start and stick with them throughout as a result.Besides working to upgrade your skaters in the game, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 also has a variety of different challenges for you to complete that will reward you with in-game items. There are a number of featured challenges that you can complete before more will pop up, but there are also static challenges for different skill levels and even skater specific ones as well. These challenges are fun to complete along the way, while also serving as some extra content to tackle after completing both Tours as well.Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater already had some unique local multiplayer modes like H-O-R-S-E and Tag that have now returned for splitscreen action with friends. Online multiplayer has also been added to the game as well in the form of either casual or competitive matches with up to seven other players. While not directly playable online, the game also brought back the Create-A-Park feature that allows you to create basically any sort of skate park you would want that you can then share online with others. With the ability to grab other people’s parks and play them as well, this adds a lot more content overall for those that just love the basic aspect of skating in the game.Known almost as well for its soundtrack as its gameplay, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater had a number of iconic songs that people still associate to the series to this day. Not quite every song from the first two games were able to be brought back here due to licensing, but there are a lot of them that were. In addition to those being included, the game also has a number of new songs added in as well. Rather than these songs being assigned to a particular stage, you can customize which songs you want to hear in your playlist within the menu and it will constantly play throughout your entire playthrough. If you come across a song you don’t like, you can just press in on the right analog stick and skip to the next, which is a nice feature to include.One of the many reasons for the failure of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 5 was how broken it was, including bugs and glitches that made playing the game a chore. Thankfully, Vicarious Visions managed to avoid those problems, with there only really being one bug that impacted my gameplay experience. This occurred twice after viewing the Park Goals Camera before a stage, which show you where each of the goals can be at least partially completed at. However, on two separate occasions the game messed up when trying to go back to the stage, where it would instead keep showing a loop of the cameras while the countdown timer would start and be counting down. It was not possible to just end the run and start over, as the glitch still remained. Instead, you have to go to another stage entirely or the home screen, with this happening in The Mall from the first game and The Hangar from the second game. This was more annoying than game breaking, but it is hopefully something that could be patched out if it is not just an isolated issue.Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater as a series fell off a long time ago, with it once looking like the series may never see a resurgence again. This is probably why Activision enlisted Vicarious Visions to step in like they did with Crash Bandicoot and help to bring the series to its roots. The addition of multiple new goals within each stage makes them feel a bit more fleshed out than before, though it would have been nice to have seen a new stage or two thrown into the mix for good measure even as a remaster. The Tony Hawk series was always just pure unadulterated fun in game form and Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 takes players back to those good ole days once again.After falling off the board entirely with Tony Hawk’s previous outing, Activision has successfully gone back to the beginning and proven again what once made the series so iconic with Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2.
Attack of the Fanboy / GAME REVIEWS / Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 Review"
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2,Victor Vellas,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-next-gen-review/,"Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 remake was released not too long ago on September 4, 2020, earning the title of the fastest selling entry in the franchise, with one million copies sold just in its first two weeks after release. It was a glorious success on every aspect, as it was one of those remakes that did a job well done. Taking everything we loved about the original products, mixing it up together with a touch of modern, it was a recipe for success.The first two games of the franchise are the highlight here, with the rest of its continuity staying where they are. For now at least, since Activision and Vicarious Visions seem to finally understand what made the first titles a grand success, leading to possible future remakes for the rest of the series. This is simply a speculation though, but taking in consideration the commercial success of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2, it is without a doubt that the beloved extreme sport is back from he grave. Hence why we are now looking at an upgraded version of the 2020 release, aiming for next-gen consoles.It all started with the legend himself, Tony Hawk, posting various tweets about his envy for the Crash Bandicoot 4 game treatment, as it was announced it will be receiving an upgrade for next-gen consoles. Of course, this was an obvious marketing campaign, a well-done one if we could add, with big names replying to his comments. Activision was one of these brands, leaving a hint that an upgrade is also coming for his own game, confirming what was already speculated. A next-gen upgrade was coming for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and a brand new release for the Nintendo Switch. Exciting news for every fan of this IP, especially those that own a Switch, as they will be now able to enjoy Tony Hawk and the rest of the pro-skaters’ roster, to their fullest and on the go.Going right into it, what next-gen brought the table for Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2, is kind of obvious. The game was already running very well in every system, both graphically and performance-wise, but this upgrade is simply the touch it needed to reach its final form. Expect a lot of graphical changes like sharper dynamic shadows, enhanced reflections and lens flares, and improved skater textures. With monitors or TV systems that do support such fidelity, the difference is noticeable right away, especially when inside a stage. User-created parks can show these enhancements even better, as players can tweak a stage’s props in such a way that will take advantage of the game’s new lighting and graphical features.Another no-brainer, is the improved frame rates the game runs at. Expect 120 frames per second in 1080p resolution (if your device does support such features) or 60 fps in native 4K. Xbox Series S is the only console that runs at 60 fps in 1440p resolution and upscales it to 4K. This is still a considerable upgrade, and all three consoles make the game looking better than ever.After more than 15 hours of game time, there wasn’t a single frame drop while I was in any of the game’s stages, nor in its other modes that are featured. If you want though, there is the option of changing the game’s graphic preference to  either ‘Fidelity’, which focus on making the game looking absolutely gorgeous, and ‘Performance’ where it is all about that max frame rate. The difference in the graphical department is barely noticeable, outside some minor tweaks, so it is suggested to keep it on performance to watch Tony and the rest of the skaters moving smoothly as butter.In any case, the game looks stunning, with stages that were made 20 years ago, looking fantastic and more detailed than they ever were. Fan favorites like the Hangar and School still have that early 2000’s vibe but modernized, even if they are reworked from the ground-up, and skaters’ controls are as tight as you would expect. With the fps increase they are even better, since now you can feel the slightest of moves being triggered the moment you touch the controller’s buttons, without any hiccups. If Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 was already a hugely responsive game, it now has touched perfection.There are a couple of ways of installing the upgraded version of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2. If you don’t have the game at all, it’s easy as you simply need to go to the corresponding store, if you want to get it online, and buy the full package from there. For the rest though, here is everything you need to know:Your save data is of course going to transfer to the new version, including your career and skater progress. The process for Xbox players is very simple, as it is automatic, however PS4 players need to first upload their save to the cloud, from within the game, and then download it to the next-gen version when installed on PS5. Additionally, Create-A-Park data is only possible to be transferred through Xbox, but not PlayStation.With everything said and done in regards to the next-gen upgrade itself, there is one last thing we need to touch upon. That would be, what is exactly Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2? Almost everyone who found themselves here looking for news about the new consoles, are of course aware, but for those that still haven’t got the game but are thinking of getting it now, we got you covered. We already have a very detailed review for the original release, which you can find and read here, so let’s only briefly mention some key points.In Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2, you take control of any of the game’s pro skaters, Tony Hawk of course included, in order to complete tasks in the various stages and Skate Tours the title offers. There are quite a few locations to see, taken from both Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 and 2, all with their own challenges and areas to explore. Doing so, will unlock more items to buy from the in-game shop, unlock new stages and you can even find certain items that provide stat points, to enhance your skaters’ stats.Outside of the already big official roster, there are a couple of hidden characters you can unlock, and the new Custom Skater system. You can create a completely new character and customize them as you see fit, with the game’s big catalog of cosmetic goodies. From shoes and clothes, to new boards, wheels and so on. These created skaters also have stats, which you can increase as well, and can be equipped with any skate trick you like.While the main focus of this title is to achieve 100% completion rate in both Tours, there are also quite a few additional modes to explore. Ranked and Free Skate for example, where you can select any of the stages, and either spend your time with Free Skate, Single Session, or Speed Run options. Free skate is simply a mode where you can enjoy the location you are in without a time limit, with the sole purpose of having fun. Single Session sets a time limit, in which you need to gather as many points as possible, by doing tricks. Your final score will then upload to Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2’s leader-boards, and Speed Run puts you in a stage where you need to achieve all of its tasks, as soon as possible. The high score is again uploaded to the online leader-boards.The game includes a Multiplayer option as well, where you can either play locally with a friend, create private rooms to play online, or join others around the world for some competitive sessions or casual. After you’ve spent a good amount of time with the single-player content of the game, this is where you should be aiming to proceed after, showing everyone the skills you’ve acquired.Last, but not least, the Create-A-Park is Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2’s sandbox feature, where you can create your own maps from a plethora of options when actually creating a stage, to either enjoy it yourself or upload it so other skaters can find it and play. There is a ton of parks created by the community, even the developers themselves shared a good amount of them, that feature any kind of props you could think of. Simply jump in and search for anything you want, it is certain you will find something or your liking.Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 does have a lot of content for player to experience, but certainly feels like even more could be added to expand the game’s lifespan. The Create-A-Park and online modes are for sure a good step towards such an instance, but there is a lot of comments from players around that world, that requested more maps from Tony Hawk’s Pros Skater 3 and further beyond to be included. While it was for sure something they could do, if you’d ask me, it’s good that they didn’t.The remake is all about Tony Hawk 1 and 2, and what it does, it does very well. Expanding it with content from additional entries, would simply make it an all-star Tony Hawk game, which could have ended up way differently than this excellent title. It’s better to have less quantity but great quality, than more content but rushed. Besides, there is always the possibility for a new remake of the rest of the sequels, so who knows what they have in store for us.Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 was already a fantastic remake, literally bringing the franchise back from the dead. Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 Next-Gen is just the definitive edition of an outstanding project, making it worthy of those extra bucks. Besides some very minor nitpicks, like what more could be added to increase its content, the game runs, looks, and plays flawlessly, just like its predecessors.

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2,Chris White,God is a Geek,https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-review/,"September 4, 2020After spending hours riding around The Warehouse Demo, I knew that Vicarious Visions were onto something wonderful with the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2. Every two-minute round saw me doing all that I could to rack up high scoring combos whilst fitting in as many tricks as humanly possible, but I missed all those challenges that became such an addiction in the originals. Neversoft’s skateboarding gems have been remastered, and they are everything I wanted them to be. Memories came flooding back about where certain secrets were, how to make the most out of each course, all whilst taking in the excellent work that has been done to make me feel like I did 20 years ago.While the layouts of each park are practically carbon copies of the originals, they look great on the current gen. The visuals aren’t on par with your AAA titles, but it doesn’t matter. THPS 1+ 2 have the feel of the originals, but feel fresh in their own way. It’s amazing how much muscle memory comes into play, but there were so many challenges I’d forgotten about. Each one pushes you to use every trick in your skill set, from wall-riding to Nosegrinding, everything you know is utilised throughout both games.Controlling your skater takes practice, and I’d forgotten how awkward it can be if you’re trying to get up and down the stairs. Hitting a wall can knock you off course, and getting back into a rhythm will shave a few seconds off your window of opportunity. What makes THPS so addictive is the need to finish off every challenge. You might attempt to get the highest score in one round, then collect all the SKATE letters the next. You’ll have played through a park over 30 times before you realise an hour has gone by, but you won’t care at all. You don’t need to finish off everything in each park to progress, but because it’s fantastic to play, you’ll probably do so anyway.You have a selection of flip, grab, and grind moves, and each one is activated by pressing a direction and a corresponding button. Using an Ollie at the moment you leave a vert ramp will be followed by a Kickflip or an Airwalk, and if you manage to rotate, you’ll grab a higher score. Mix this with a grind when you land on the railings, and you’ll build your combo. Manuals are important pieces of the puzzle, as these help to get multipliers on your trick score. With the variety of courses and the sheer amount of moves at your disposal, there’re plenty of opportunities to reach some pretty epic scores. You’ve also got special moves which can be initiated by a selection of buttons, and these can be unlocked or changed in your Skater menu.Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 have tons of customisation options that let you alter the clothing of your skater, the board, and more. You can unlock these by completing challenges, or buy them from the in-game store with the money you own. You can create a skater to play through both games with, and it’s cool seeing yourself in your new gear as you race around NY City or The Mall. To earn Stat Points to level up your skater, you must collect them in the courses and parks, or complete Challenges to do so, improving everything from how much air you get or how quickly you spin.. There’re tons of objectives that grant you stats and items, with some of them as simple as hitting a Melon or changing your t-shirt. There are also different levels of challenges ranging from Rookie to Veteran, and they kept me busy for hours as I tried to hit each one.There’s also the return of some of the best multiplayer games from the series, such as Horse and Tag. You can play them locally or online, and they are just as fun as I remember. Introducing my daughter to the world of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater felt weirdly like I was passing the torch, and she loves them just as much as I do. Create-A-Park returns as well, and there’re plenty of options for you to build the best park you can. Everything from half pipes to railing is available, and you can also purchase new stuff in-game.To say I love these remasters is an understatement. The old soundtracks are back, as well as other songs from new and old artists alike;  kudos to whoever decided to add Sublime to the mix. The skateboarding culture has never died out, but it was never as popular as it was when Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater was in the limelight, and I’m glad it’s back. Not only are these great looking remasters, they stay true to the originals whilst updating the excitement and satisfaction of the gameplay.Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 make me feel joyful. I adored these games when I was younger, and they’re just as much fun to play now. Seeing guys like Bucky Lasek and Rodney Mullins as older guys in the game definitely made me feel better about still enjoying skateboarding, but it was cool to see newer talent included as well. If you adored the originals as much as I did, then I can honestly say Vicarious Visions has done an amazing job in bringing back the noise.Looks amazing

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2,Jeff Grubb,GamesBeat,https://venturebeat.com/2020/09/03/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-and-2-review-skateboarding-is-gamings-soulmate/,"Connect with top gaming leaders in Los Angeles at GamesBeat Summit 2023 this May 22-23. Register here.Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater never should’ve gone away. These are some of the defining games of the PlayStation, Dreamcast, and Xbox eras. And publisher Activision only had to put the franchise to bed because it so thoroughly pillaged its riches with annual releases and then a pair of careless attempts to revive it. Now, in the hands of Vicarious Visions, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 and 2 is back, and it’s a reminder that games don’t get much better than this.Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 and 2 launches September 4 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and the Epic Games Store. As the name suggests, it is a remake of the first two Tony Hawk games. It combines modern visuals with classic levels and the skating/combo mechanics of the later releases.The end result is a video game that looks, sounds, and feels incredible. And it’s one that should appeal to long-time fans and people who are new to skateboarding entirely.I played on the PlayStation 4 Pro.GamesBeat Summit 2023Join the GamesBeat community in Los Angeles this May 22-23. You’ll hear from the brightest minds within the gaming industry to share their updates on the latest developments.Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater is the platonic ideal of a video game. If movies and TV are about stories and characters and music is about melody and rhythm, then games are about physics and interaction. And those are the elements where the Tony Hawk games have always excelled.Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 and 2 is about moving your skater through a 3D environment. Through repetition, you learn how your character balances and what they are capable of, and then you start to see the hidden lines that you can string together through that space.This game captures that aspect of the classic Tony Hawks. And when it’s at its best, it almost feels like a zen or meditative experience. When I’m playing, my brain shuts off. I’m just jacked into the world of Pro Skater.It’s amazing that after all this time — more than 20 years — Tony Hawk is still the game I’m going to point to when I describe what I want from this medium. And Vicarious Visions should get a lot of credit for enshrining that so successfully.Above: All of the old secrets are back.The structure of Tony Hawk 1 and 2 is simple, and that comes down to the faithfulness of the remake. Like in the original games, you get two minutes to complete various objectives. These include high-score challenges that get progressively higher. But it also includes quests like kickflipping over specific gaps or finding five collectibles in the world.Vicarious Visions doesn’t try to embellish these things. Instead, it offers up an exact re-creation of what you got in the original games. And that means the game can often feel basic, but I welcome it. I’m glad that the developers didn’t try to bog down the pacing with complex new scenarios.Instead, if you want to get more from these stages, you can hop into multiplayer, which supports online and local play. It also has a casual Jams mode and the competitive ranked matches. In multiplayer, you’ll go through a variety of modes including standard score attack and best combo. I like the graffiti game where you mark your territory by performing tricks and combos on different obstacles. Then you can attempt to take course elements from an opponent, but to do so, you must land a higher-scoring trick than them.If you’re not into the multiplayer, don’t expect to get dozens of hours out of the game, but I’m already looking forward to ensuring I have the highest scores among my friends.But while Vicarious Visions was careful to maintain the feel and design of the original games, it gave the look a significant overhaul.Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 and 2 looks like a modern game. It has smooth animations, detailed characters and geometry, and high-res textures. The lighting has a lifelike camera quality. I think Vicarious Visions’ artists also did a nice job capturing the somewhat grungy swagger of the original PlayStation and Nintendo 64 releases. That seems to come down to camera filters and effects, but it works.The developers also rebuilt each skater to match their current, older selves. And I find that really wonderful. All of these people still skate. Tony Hawk landed a 900 when he was 48. We don’t have to pretend that skating — an art as much as it is a sport — is something exclusively for the young.Above: There is The Birdman himself!But these character models also give the game a different vibe than the punk-rock original. You’re looking at some people who — since the release of Tony Hawk Pro Skater — have gone on to create million-dollar businesses. They are parents who want to pay for their kids’ education. And it’s nice that this game doesn’t try to hide the reality of age to maintain some faux youth-culture energy.Likewise the soundtrack has also aged but by mostly standing still. Activision was able to bring back almost all of the songs from the first two games. On top of that, it also recorded new effects for the characters. Tony Hawk now grunts like Tony Hawk. And the sound of your skateboard’s trucks slamming onto a rail or landing on the ground is almost like ASMR.Skateboarding and video games belong together. The former started in the 1950s and went through growth spurts in the 1960s and 1980s alongside the first video games. This made them cousins just because they both had a similar counter-culture streak and a chip on their shoulders about mainstream acceptance.But it goes deeper than this. They’re about the same things. They’re about what happens when you set a body in motion on top of another body in motion. They both explore what happens when a person throws themselves into the sky and then has to deal with repercussions of a planet’s gravity pulling them back down. And they are both about expression, creativity, and form.Skateboarding didn’t need the Olympics. And video games didn’t need the approval of Hollywood. As both were approaching maturity, they found each other and produced Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater. And those games helped expand the popularity of both skating and games. They also helped to define what was special about each.For video games, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 and 2 still shows us what games are capable of. You’ll find sad dads in books. Movies will have equally moving stories. Music can show us that emotions are not necessarily tied to language. But only video games can re-create skateboarding.Score: 90/100Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 and 2 is available September 4 for $40.

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2,Ben Lombardo,GamingTrend,https://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/a-prettied-ps4-re-release-tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-review/,"I don’t think it’s possible to have not played a Tony Hawk’s game yet. There’s been a lot, and I’m not talking about just the Pro Skater games — there’s been a ton of series. We’ve had, obviously, Pro Skater, as well as American Wasteland, Underground, Motion, Ride, Shred — the list goes on. As for me, well, I’ll be honest I’ve only ever really played Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 for the PS1. THPS 1 and 2 were introduced to me much later in life, and while I may not carry the same feeling of nostalgia as many others I can still very much appreciate them.However, the question remains. Will I appreciate the PS5 release of THPS 1 + 2?Now, Editor David Flynn has already reviewed THPS 1 + 2, and you can get the rundown here. David has already touched on what’s good and bad about the game, whereas I’ll be focusing on the technical difference with the PS5 version (just so you’re not reading the same thing twice). Nonetheless, let’s get on with it! As you may already know, THPS 1 + 2 is a remake of the very first Tony Hawk’s games. As with remakes, they can be a bit iffy or feel like a money grab. Developer Vicarious Visions have done a great job improving and implementing some solid changes to this remake to feel worthy of the hefty AAA price tag while missing out on some others. I do remember the original games feeling a bit heavy and clunky to play, whereas the remake feels smooth and responsive. Now, I feel like I can land far more difficult tricks with ease, stacking up combos and keeping my special meter high.Since this game is a remake that’s been re-released on the PS5, you might be wondering what the developers have implemented to make it feel like it’s a true next-gen game. Let’s be honest, excluding visuals (because, I mean, it’s Unreal Engine 4 and it’s hard to make a pretty game even prettier) the only things that matter are DualSense implementations and loading times. I’ll start with the latter. I’m not sure if the loading times were ever an issue in the PS4 release, because the only time it’ll matter is when you stack a trick and your character falls off their board. At least for the PS5 release, that’s instantaneous. Still, if you’re wondering, you won’t be spending much time in level loading screens — they’re pretty damn instantaneous too. That’s especially helpful when you’re trying to score a huge high score to finish a challenge, and you just want to quickly reset the level to try again.For the DualSense controller, well that’s a weird one. This might be the only time where I’d say the implemented PS4 controller features we’re better than the PS5 because these new changes are pretty jarring. I’ll start with haptic feedback. It’s ok, although it feels more like the PS4 vibration with slight improvements than something I’ve come to expect from the DualSense (Astro’s Playroom has really set the bar high on what’s possible, and what should be done). It doesn’t really feel like I’m skating, or grinding on rails — it feels pretty standard.As for adaptive triggers, well this is the weirdest one. The only time I find them locking up and feeling adaptive is when I try to land a revert (where you spin the board as it makes contact with the ground). When you’re riding or in the air the triggers are loose, but just as you can land and try to revert the triggers will lock up. It’s a super handy way of working out when you can land this trick (since you can hold the triggers loosely, then feel them tense up when you can land revert), but that’s about it. Sure, it feels tense and grippy as if you were landing one IRL, but that’s the only time that I found adaptive triggers were used. It would’ve been fun to have them implemented on, say, when you balance a grind — the left and right triggers lock up and you have to keep them at an even tensity to stay balanced — but sadly that’s not the case. A bit of a swing and a miss with the DualSense’s features.There are only two more things I’ll mention. Firstly, I didn’t find any bugs, glitches, or other technical grievances with the game — it’s fully optimized and feels like a solid final release of the game. Secondly, there have been no changes to the game’s content between the PS4 and PS5 release. For new players, that’s not a bad thing because they’ll have plenty of hours of content to chew through. However, previous players of the PS4 release may find themselves quickly bored by zero new content. Still, starting fresh is always an option if previous players aren’t interested in carrying their save over.So, to be honest, the PS5 version of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 isn’t a massive leap ahead from the PS4 release. There are some differences, like near-instantaneous loading times, but the DualSense features aren’t fully realized. It could have been so much more, but it seems like development was focused on bringing the game from PS4 to PS5, with loading times being a bargain and other PS5 features being something that was added in extra due to some freed-up development time.Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 for the PS5 is a great PlayStation game, but not necessarily a great PS5 game. It’s still a ton of fun to play, with no noticeable bugs or glitches. However, the only utilized PS5 feature is improved loading times. Adaptic triggers and haptic feedback felt largely unused, so much so it felt more like I was playing with a PS4 controller. Nonetheless, that doesn’t stop this remake from being amazing --- it’s still a ton of fun to play, and for new players there’s plenty of content to chew through that you won’t necessarily be missing those missed DualSense features.—Ben LombardoSee below for our list of partners and affiliates:One of the longest running independent gaming news, reviews and culture sites on the web.The thing that is magical about the Wizarding World isn’t the magic – it’s...by Ron BurkeThe world is going to end.

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2,David Flynn,GamingTrend,https://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/skate-or-live-tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-review/,"The Tony Hawk series has returned to its former glory. Many people, like myself, have a lot of nostalgia for the Pro Skater games. The franchise fell out of the public consciousness after subsequent games added unneeded features that didn’t add to the core gameplay in any way. There’s no story in Pro Skater 1 + 2, no controller gimmicks, just pure skateboarding fun – and that’s the way I like it.THPS1+2 is a remake/combination of the first two games in the series, released in 1999 and 2000 respectively. The years have been surprisingly kind to the locations you’ll visit, thanks to Vicarious Visions, as you’ll collect secret tapes, jump sick gaps, and perform gnarly tricks, bruh. If you’ve played any game in the franchise, you’ll feel right at home here. I was actually very surprised how much muscle memory came back to me considering it’s been over a decade since I’ve played one of these, and that’s thanks to the excellent controls.Whatever Pro you choose to play as or choose to create your own skater, the game feels mostly responsive and easy to control. It feels just a bit better than the warehouse demo even. The “mostly” there is very infrequent, but I would find my skater doing some tricks or releasing an ollie when I didn’t want them to. I mostly used the D-Pad on my old DS4 controller, so that may be at fault, but it’s worth mentioning regardless. Controls are standardized and customizable across all levels of both games as well, turns out you can teach old dogs new tricks, so you can do all the reverts, spine transfers, and 900s you want on any stage.As for what you’ll be doing in those stages, you’ve got a checklist in each level to complete. Some tasks persist across levels, like getting a high enough score or combo and collecting SKATE and secret tapes. Others are unique to the stage like wallriding alarm bells or ollieing over a homeless man 5 times (which just feels cruel). To unlock the next stage, you have to complete a certain amount of objectives across all previous levels, which incentivizes returning to older stages and mastering them. As you play, you’ll also gain experience and level up, which grants you the ability to purchase new clothes for your created skaters, board designs, and strangely, parts to use when creating your own levels. As of writing, there are no microtransactions present in this system, but I’d be surprised if Activision doesn’t force them in at some point. The game also presents you with several challenges to complete for even more experience and fake cash, like getting a combo of a certain length. The closest comparison I can think of are Nook Miles in Animal Crossing: New Horizons, in that they serve as small rewards just for playing the game.In addition to clothing and boards, you can customize just about every move a particular skater can do. You can change the button combinations of any basic tricks as well as assign up to 8 special tricks, with four unlocked from the start. Once I found a setup I liked, I didn’t mess with it much. I also stuck with my created character for the majority of my playtime, but there are a lot of Pros to play as like Tony Hawk, Chad Muska, Leticia Bufoni, and Aori Nishimura with more unlockable during play. They all have game logos to find in each level, which will earn more points to allocate into their stats like speed or manual balance.Running on Unreal Engine, the game looks gorgeous with tons of new details added to make each location feel more alive, and the nostalgia factor also helps here just a tad. While the game looks and feels great while playing, I ran into several issues in menus, especially the shop, where the game would take a few seconds to fully load a texture or the framerate dropping dramatically as you scroll through customization options. Of course these won’t ruin the experience of actually playing the game, if there were any frame drops while playing I certainly didn’t notice them, but it certainly made me go into the shop less to not have to deal with all the waiting.THPS1+2 also sports local and online multiplayer, the latter of which we were able to try out thanks to some kind volunteers at Activision and Vicarious Visions. You and other skaters around the world will compete in various challenges like getting a high score, getting the longest combo, or a mode called Grafiti. In Graffiti, you’ll do tricks off of surfaces and ramps and claim them in your color. If another player performs a higher scoring series of tricks off of the same surface, they’ll claim it instead. Multiplayer is fun enough, but all the modes don’t really have you interacting with other players. You can see them as you play, but you just pass right through them. While this is appropriate for the modes on offer, I would have liked to see the game take the more wacky approach from later games with modes like a king of the hill match or racing through stages like Downhill Jam. Despite my less than great internet connection, I encountered absolutely no issues in multiplayer, aside from just barely losing to several people who are inhumanly good at these games.Pro Skater 1 + 2 not only perfectly recreates the pure joy of the originals, it improves on them greatly. The visuals have obviously been improved, but so have the responsive controls. If you have liked a Tony Hawk game in the past, you’ll feel right at home here.—David FlynnSee below for our list of partners and affiliates:One of the longest running independent gaming news, reviews and culture sites on the web.The thing that is magical about the Wizarding World isn’t the magic – it’s...by Ron BurkeThe world is going to end.

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2,Tom Hoggins,Telegraph,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/features/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-review-brilliant-remaster-nails-modern/,"
			The early-2000s skateboarding sims are among some of the best games ever made and this update recaptures a punkish heart for a new audience
		From the moment I dropped into the opening Warehouse level in this remaster of early-noughties-defining Tony Hawk's Pro Skater games, the muscle memory came flooding back. Recalled visions of million-point combos, stringing together a calvacade of grinds, lip tricks and impossible air, fingers dancing across the buttons. Here I go, I think, before launching off the back-wall half-pipe and immediately spiralling into a 540 Indy grab... then fluffing the landing and splatting poor old Tony across the tarmac.So, yes, for veterans there might be some rust to shake off the trucks before returning to your former skateboarding glory. But it is a feat that Vicarious Visions have achieved with this fabulous remaster, locating Neversoft's original code for its first two games, tweaking the necessary mod-cons and giving it a current-gen lick of paint.The result is a package that looks and play as your brain recalls it -the golden ticket for a remaster- videos of the originals now reveal a blocky and less slick version than is in your mind's eye. This brings it into more into line with how you think you remember it -roping in tricks (like the combo-linking manual) from later games- while retaining the heart that made it so good in the first place.And it is still extraordinarily good. The original Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 is second to only Ocarina of Time in Metacritic's highest ranked video games of all time and, regardless of whether you put much stock into such things, it is a well-earned position. The trick here is to unpack just what makes it such a treat, not so much for experienced players (they know what they are getting) but for younger folk for which the late-90s/early noughties skateboarding craze came too early. There are plenty of mod cons to satisfy a new audience: online play, countless game-spanning challenges and a solid Create-A-Park mode that allows you to share and play other players bonkers creations. But its excellence comes in how it provides its undeniable thrills.First and foremost it is because Tony Hawk's Pro Skater is chiefly concerned with being an exceptional video game. It never was a skateboarding 'simulation', more a digital fever dream with a die-hard reverence for its punkish subculture. The levels are manic combinations of street scenes and skate parks, often mundane urban areas re-imagined into a skater's paradise and packed with floating collectibles, secret locations and those special spots designed to reap enormous combinations.That Warehouse is a relatively tame mix of half-pipes and rails to ease you into learning the basics (though can be rinsed for huge scores for those in the know). Later in the first game you will trade it for the more merciless chaos of Downhill Jam, hurtling down a tight dam with valves to grind open and hidden swooping ramps to launch yourself improbably high across its water gaps. The second game in the package follows a similar pattern, but its levels become larger and more elaborate - from schoolyards, to New York City, venice Beach and beyond. While the street levels are almost universally more fun to whizz through than the skate parks, the variety is consistently arresting.This extends to the objectives; a list of 10 challenges per level that have you chasing high-scores, performing specific tricks in specific spots (ollie the cars, grind the school roll-call railings) and squirreling out collectibles. It strikes a terrific balance between skilful score chasing, exploration and the odd environmental puzzle that tasks you with find how to get to there from there using the 8-inch wide slab of maple wood beneath your feet.The performance of those jumps and tricks rests at the heart of it all. I will bang on incessantly about the best video games being the ones where you have an almost invisible connection between the controller in your hands and the character on-screen. This is from countless hours of playing Super Mario and -bear with me on the comparison here- the early Tony Hawk games. Once in the flow of spinning out of a half-pipe, into a manual before screeching into a succession of special grinds, your fingers on the pad become pure instinct.It doesn't always work, of course, and in my old age I bail far more often than I would like, watching my combo counter crumple into red mist as I plonk the board sideways. It can be a tough, often infuriating mistress, but one that always seems fair with any wipeouts feeling liek your fault. There is a knack to the amount of leeway you are given when landing and snapping into a grind; the game wanting to give you plenty of room for arcadey experimentation as you snap between tricks. But also give you enough challenge that when you nail a particularly troublesome objective or nail a huge combo, the feeling is one of exhilarating triumph.And let's be clear on this: Pro Skater's raucous energy is not something easily replicated - even within the same series. That the first four editions were bottled magic became ever clearer as calamitous later entries in the Tony Hawk series piled up. That this remaster both captures that nostalgic heart and makes the series feel fresh and relevant again is an impressive trick to land."
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2,Miles Dompier,Windows Central,https://www.windowscentral.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-review-game-decade-contender,"No offers foundWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.Tony Hawk's Pro Skater is easily one of the biggest franchises in video game history, but recent entries have not only failed to capture the magic of the original games, but honestly tarnished the reputation of the series. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 was an absolute disaster and there's an increasing number of spinoffs focusing on gimmicks over gameplay. Does anybody remember Tony Hawk's Ride?It makes total sense for a franchise that's clearly lost its way, to revisit its roots, and reevaluate what made these skating games so special in the first place and that's exactly what Vicarious Visions did with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2. This team managed to replicate the incredible, tight gameplay of these iconic titles and even make two games that are literally decades old, look and feel like a modern game.With a fresh coat of paint and some additional features, it becomes crystal clear just how ahead of the times the first two Tony Hawk's Pro Skater games were.Bottom line: Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 manages to deliver a gaming experience greater than my fondest memories of the franchise. These classic games look and feel better than ever.As someone who spent hundreds of hours playing Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 growing up, I went into this remake with a laundry list of expectations and a whole lot of muscle memory. Unfortunately for my fingers and my brain, this muscle memory was tied to sub-30 FPS on the PS1, so initially adapting to a locked 60 FPS on the Xbox One X was pretty intense. I spent the first several sessions crashing simple combos that I would have nailed with ease back in the day, but once was my reflexes caught up with the increased frame rate, everything clicked in a big way. These games didn't feel as good as I remembered them, they actually felt better.Additional mechanics from later Tony Hawk games like wall-hopping and reverts completely changed my combo game. I was able to revisit classic runs from my favorite stages and stretch my combos even further thanks to these additional features. While you do have the option to switch to classic Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 control schemes, these restrict your ability to wall-hop, revert, and even manual, but if you're interested in experiencing the most faithful feel of these classic games, this is a really cool detail for long-time fans.Even after all this time, I really can't stress enough how great these games feel. Even players who never touched the originals can dive into this remake and have a blast trying to beat their own high scores or gather fun collectibles thanks to its perfectly crafted arcade design. Sometimes revisiting a game you love reminds of its glaring flaws, but with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2, it only reinforces why this franchise was such a massive success.The only thing as important as the gameplay in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater franchise is the killer soundtracks. The music of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 defined a generation and perfectly embodied the spirit of skateboarding culture. This special blend of rock, hip-hop, alternative, and even heavy metal, didn't really exist in any other genre at the time.The soundtracks for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 are easily two of the best of all time and having the songs from the original games return with this remake, is a huge feat and an even bigger win when it comes delivering on that classic feeling. In addition to the tracks from the original soundtracks' 22 artists, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 adds 37 new songs, bringing the total to a staggering 59. While some of the new artists don't deliver the same skate-hype as infamous tracks like Guerilla Radio by Rage Against the Machine and When World's Collide by Powerman 5000, there are still some pretty great standouts from artists like Mercules, Billy Talent, and Zebrahead. Thankfully, you have the option to customize your skate playlist and skip any tracks that don't deliver on your skate vibe.There's really something for everyone here on the music front and I'm a bit blown away by the team's dedication to delivering on what was most definitely a licensing nightmare. Also, in case anyone needs a reminder - 'No Cigar' by Millencolin still hits hard.As we see more and more studios deliver incredible remakes, it becomes very apparent just how much we filled in the gaps of the original's graphical limitations with our imaginations. Going back and watching footage of the original Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2, I couldn't believe how poor the draw distance was and how bland the environments looked. I vividly remembered these areas feeling alive and vibrant, but now they are mostly dull and filled with gray fog.The updated Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 somehow manages to present environments that are more detailed and dynamic than even my wildest imagination as a child. Stages like Venice have bustling backgrounds with ocean waves, flocks of seagulls, and even sailboats. With a seemingly endless draw distance, you really feel like these places exist in a world and not simply as an isolated series of ramps and rails in a video game.The amount of detail in the recreated stages from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is genuinely jaw-dropping. You can stop anywhere on any stage and marvel at all the small touches Vicarious Visions put in to reimagine these iconic locations. The updated mall is incredible and a bit depressing, as all the shops from the original games are now boarded up and vandalized – mirroring the modern-day decline of the shopping mall. As a fan of the original games it was incredible seeing my favorite stages meticulously reconstructed and anyone jumping in for the first time will still be impressed by these gorgeous environments.One of my favorite elements of the original Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 was creating my own skater and living the Pro Skater dream. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 expands character customization in some huge ways. The number of boards and clothing options is so much more expansive than the original games. You have hundreds of options to choose from. Not only can you change your deck, grip tape, trucks, wheels, outfit, and appearance, but you can also customize your profile to share your favorite deck and emblem with other players online.The expansive skateshop offers a wide range of items you can purchase with your hard-earned skate cash, but there are also special unlocks tied to specific in-game challenges – including some amazing animated decks. Collecting SKATE and completing all stage challenges in both Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 also unlocks fun modifiers like Tiny Skater and low-gravity. And for players looking to forever leave their mark on the skating landscape, the new and improved create-a-park gives some pretty impressive stage creation tools. You can even upload and skate other player's creations online.With over 700 challenges, hundreds of unlocks, and a great suite of customization and creation tools, this is easily the most expansive Tony Hawk's Pro Skater experience to date. You literally and figuratively have a serious amount of stuff to grind.Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 brings back all your favorite local multiplayer modes and introduces a collection of new modes for local and online play. Horse and Free Skate make their return, but are unfortunately restricted to local play at the moment, but the classic Trick Attack and new modes like Combo Mambo and Combo Challenge are available to play in local or online multiplayer.A simplified party system and playlists for casual or competitive play, quickly throw you and up to 7 other players in a streamlined matchmaking system with a randomized assortment of these game modes. While I appreciate the overall simplicity of the matchmaking process in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2, I really hope the team has plans on expanding the options for online play. As it stands, you can't create a private skate session with your friends, choose a stage, play Free Skate or Horse, or even play created stages with other players.The local options are far more robust than online play right now, but that didn't stop me and remote friends from playing for hours at a time. With a few tweaks to online matchmaking, this could easily be the perfect Tony Hawk's Pro Skater multiplayer experience.The remake of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is a genuine triumph. Rarely does a game, especially a remake, meet my admittedly lofty expectations, but in the case of these two classic skating titles, Vicarious Visions absolutely blew me away. They managed to make two of my favorite games of all time look and feel better than they ever have.With beautifully recrafted stages, a massive collection of modes and unlocks, and gameplay that just doesn't get old, there's so much to love here. If Resident Evil 2 set the bar for quality video game remakes, then Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 has successfully Airwalked over it and set a new gold standard.Outside of a single complaint regarding a somewhat restricted online offering, this is a perfect remake and stands firmly as my Game of the Year for 2020. I'll have some serious internal debating to do, but there's even a genuine possibility this remake will end up being my game of the decade.The perfect remasterNew ways to play these classic gamesPlaying Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 feels so much better than ever before. Grab some friends and experience the king of skateboarding games.Miles Dompier is a Freelance Video Producer for Windows Central, focusing on video content for Windows Central Gaming.

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2,Will Freeman,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/sep/04/tony-hawks-pro-skater-12-review-skateboarding-ps4-xbox-one-pc,"PS4, Xbox One, PC; Vicarious Visions/ActivisionThe legendary skateboarding sim is back in a brilliant rerelease that offers a portal to the pastSkateboarding has often been misunderstood and misrepresented. To a degree, that’s part of its appeal. To skate is to exist out of step with traffic and pedestrians, moving through urban spaces in a way that architects and town planners never intended and reinventing mundane blocks of concrete as a canvas for play and creativity. It is a subculture as much as a sport, but skateboarding is also a welcoming home for misfits.So many adverts and music videos that clumsily riff on skating have failed to understand what the sport is about. But in 1999, a PlayStation game came along that did more than translate the mechanics of skateboarding into superb gameplay. Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater offered a portal to the subculture. It understood what it was to be part of skateboarding, to the point it felt near-documentary. The game was authentic yet accessible, welcoming a new generation to skateboarding while making household names of Hawk and his peers. Along with its sequel, it also had a tremendous influence on game design.Some 20 years later, the pair are the subject of a brilliant rerelease that serves up a portion of Y2K-era popular culture alongside the modernised and updated games. Each original Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater level is there, along with the cast. New tricks have been added from later series entries, letting you explore the spread of warehouses and empty schools with longer combos and individual flair – an improvement that adds nuance to the game without muddling its arcade purity. A host of contemporary skating pros join the roster, and while much of the original pop/punk-heavy soundtrack is in place, it is bolstered by additional music.The trick-focused, combo-heavy gameplay remains fundamentally unchanged. You’re usually dropped into two-minute sessions where goals must be met – score enough points, collect enough things. And everything is where it was before, from scattered “SKATE” letters to hidden video tapes. There’s a brilliantly fun, if basic, online mode (due to be expanded), while the seminal split-screen multiplayer of the originals returns. Additional achievement-like challenges and fresh skater and park creation tools also now feature.The most significant difference is that you can now move between both games with a single player profile, taking upgrades and progress with you. This remake presents Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 as a museum that you are free to wander through as you please. The visual design, from menus to fonts, leans heavily towards Y2K design. Today that might look cluttered and over-designed, and the fuzzy 4:3 skate videos seem downright archaic.Even if you are not nostalgic for the originals and or interested in skateboarding culture, there is still plenty to enjoy. The levels feel small by modern standards and the systems behind the skating aren’t always well communicated, but the first two games remain deeply engrossing, refined creations. Chasing scores, puzzling your way to seemingly inaccessible collectibles and drumming up some friendly rivalry with another player is as exciting as it ever was. Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 open a portal to a place, time and subculture – and it’s a delight to step through.Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2 is out now; £39.99."
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2,Stephan Adamus,COGconnected,https://cogconnected.com/review/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-switch-review/,"Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 2 was a cultural phenomenon. I would give it major credit for the current hugeness of skateboard culture, and extreme sports being popularized in general. If you’re a fan of the original games, then you definitely want this collection. It’s an enhancement and celebration of everything you already know and love about those games. If you’ve never played any of the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater games before, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 is the best place to start.All of the levels, songs, tricks, and skaters one could hope for are represented. All the content from the first two Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater games is merged into a cohesive whole. Points gained from levels in Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater can be used to enhance skaters in Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 2 levels, and visa versa.There’s so much content in this game, including: multiplayer, create-a-skater, create-a-park, an experience system, points challenges, score boards, etc. One could easily get lost in the many modes offered. My only problem with the game is that I’m still burnt out from playing too much Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 on Nintendo 64, and I found things got repetitive quickly. Anyone new to the franchise, or anyone who didn’t burn themselves out back in the day, are in for a real treat though.Almost the entire original soundtrack is represented in Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2. Every single track I remember is here (including the most important: Superman by Goldfinger). There’s even a newly created soundtrack, which is honestly pretty weak, but the game has enough customization options to make it so you’ll only hear the tracks you want to.Even though the controls are closer to newer Tony Hawk Pro Skater games, there’s still the option to switch to the controls to those of the original two games. Everything is so customizable that the only piece of the Pro Skater puzzle I was missing was the secret Spider-Man character from Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 2. My only huge complaint is I wish they’d given more robust create-a-skater options. For sure players will be able to make their dream board, but the skaters themselves are very limited. For a fatty ding dong like me, it was a bit of a bummer to not be able to make a skateboarder that looked anywhere close to me. The best I got was an anorexic Seth Rollins look-alike.The Switch version doesn’t have as good of graphics as the PS5 or Xbox Series versions, but they’re still fine. I doubt most people are playing Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 for the mind-blowing textures and realistic character models anyways. What’s much more important is that the framerate is solid, and the game plays smooth. It works just as well in portable mode, so if you’d like an on-the-go version of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2, you’ll be happy to know that the Switch version is as great as one could hope for.Whether you’re a fan of the originals, or a curious party looking to get into skateboarding games, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 is a must play. All the original content, a smooth framerate, portability, loads of in-game customization, and a pinch of new content are a recipe for skateboarding success. Only a lack of create-a-skater options and lack of Spider-Man mar this fun flashback. This is what it’s like when worlds collide.***Nintendo Switch code provided by the publisher***Developer: Vicarious VisionsPublisher: Activision"
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2,Lou Sytsma,COGconnected,https://cogconnected.com/review/tony-hawks-pro-skater-12-ps5-review/,"While professional sports leagues have been around for a long time they are confined to elite athletes, and to mostly team sports with strict rules and regulations. Other avenues, like Extreme Sports, arose in the 1990s and gained world-wide prominence with the Extreme Sports Channel which ran the X-Games. They were called extreme because of the much higher probability of sustaining injuries. One of those sports, of course, was skateboarding. Any skateboarder that aims to be the best must accept the certainty of injuries as their arena is the streets around them. To a skateboarder the term concrete jungle takes on a totally painful meaning. Skinned knees and elbows are the least of their concerns. Avoiding broken bones or concussions is like winning the lottery.Into this sport came Tony Hawk. Known as the Birdman, he became the first skateboarder to perform a 900 – which means doing two and half revolutions in mid-air. As the dominant force in skateboarding, Hawk parlayed that success into many other avenues. One of those was a deal with Activision to make video games. The Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater (THPS) video game series was born and spawned 18 titles. Of all of those titles the best received were Tony Hawk 1 & 2. Naturally these two games were bundled together, remastered, and released on the PS4, Xbox One X, and PC last year.Now the games ran at 1080p glory and at 60FPS. For the first time, the video game hardware was available to present the games in a manner befitting the dynamic nature of skateboarding with an extra level of immersion afforded by the control responsiveness with 60FPS graphics. All the jumps, bumps, grinds, and acrobatics are now faithfully reproduced in a visceral and satisfying package. THPS 1+2 has now been given an extra greater level of polish and have been upgraded to take advantage of the horsepower of the current Gen consoles such as the PS5 and Xbox Series X.If you’ve read our previous review of the previous-gen version of Tony Hawk 1 & 2 then you know this remaster was masterly done. If you want to know all about the goodness of the game and what it includes, please read the linked review above. This review will instead focus on the differences between the PS4 & PS5 versions of the game. Suffice it to say, all the moves, locations, characters, gameplay options, online/multiplayer are present. For digital deluxe edition owners, the upgrade to the PS5 version is free. Owners of the regular version are going to have to pay a $10 charge to upgrade to the PS5. Is the extra expense worth it? Let’s grab our board, hit a location, and see.On the technical side of things the upgrade to the PS5 version is pretty modest. The game runs in native 4K mode at a locked 60 FPS mode. There is also a Performance Option to play the game at 120F FPS at 1080P resolution but that mode is one I couldn’t test with my 60Hz only 4K TV. Also included is HDR support which increases the color gamut making for better reflections and shadow detail. The end result is a presentation which is a bit darker overall but lends a more solid and realistic look. When compared to the PS4 version, which runs a dynamic resolution solution that varies between 1080p and 1440p, the PS4 version displays a more video game-like presentation. It’s a bit disappointing that there is no video mode for the PS5 version that utilizes ray tracing.As expected, with the speed of SSD, load times are practically non-existent on a PS5. While not instantaneous, load times generally run in the 3-5 second range, a noticeable improvement over the PS4 version. Another way this version speeds things up is through the use of the PS5 Activity Card feature. Clicking on an Activity Card allows you to jump straight into the action foregoing all the standard navigation through game start and menu navigations.And that’s not the only notable gameplay enhancement. DualSense is supported with this version which brings an extra layer of immersion to the controls not possible with the Dual Shock 4. The haptic feedback is generally muted but it really kicks in when grinding. It’s a blast to feel the differing degrees of rattling and rumbling and shaking. You’ll also notice the differences in grinding based on the surface type of whatever you are railing on. Flat or concrete surfaces such as ledges or walls have a more aggressive and deeper vibration. On rounded surfaces such as rails the vibration is lighter, quicker, and smoother. There is support for the adaptive triggers but given the nature of the gameplay mechanics, the triggers aren’t used that much. Their function is for in-air tricks so the gradient of change needed for the triggers is minimal.In terms of additional content the upgraded version includes additional skins for the characters including retro outfits for Tony Hawk, Steve Caballero, and Rodney Mullen. The retro content is also extended to the Create-A-Skater mode. The most noticeable player addition is the iconic ‘The Ripper’ skater created by artist V.C. Johnson for the skateboard company giant: Powell-Peralta. It’s definitely cool to board around in bony glory in skeleton mode.Overall, the visual upgrade to 4K and the power of the PS5 take this already great game and add an extra level of immersion to it. Everything that is great in the PS4 version of the game is here, just better and faster. With the haptic feedback only possible with the DualSense, you’ll feel not only more in touch with it, but also more control in the game. Short of an entire remake to take full advantage of the new consoles this is the premium way to play Tony Hawk 1 + 2. While the overall differences between the PS4 and PS5 may be subtle, once you play the PS5 version you won’t want to go back to the other one. So yeah, the $10 is worth it. The original review gave the game a 95 rating. That rating holds for the PS5 version too. That said, I would have gone higher if more graphical enhancements like ray tracing had been added.***PS5 review code provided by the publisher***Developer: Vicarious VisionsPublisher: Activision"
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2,Stephen Tailby,Push Square,http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/tony_hawks_pro_skater_1_plus_2,"GuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpKeeping the combo goingVersion Reviewed: EuropeanTony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2, in case you weren't aware, is an excellent remake of the first two games in the legendary series. It originally launched last year on PlayStation 4, and it's a fantastic reimagining of these skateboarding classics. While it looked great on the older hardware, Activision has seen fit to develop and release a PS5 version, taking advantage of all the new bells and whistles. So, how is it?Well, first of all, it's still a cracking arcadey sports game. No matter where you play it, the remake revitalises the seminal franchise by folding in all the gameplay tweaks from subsequent releases, meaning it plays like a dream. There's an old-school charm to it all; it's quite a challenge, and the objectives in each level are refreshingly simple. The title also adds in original content in the form of new objectives, hundreds of unique challenges, and a revamped Create A Park mode, as well as decent online multiplayer.As for PS5-specific enhancements, the thing you'll notice most is the DualSense feedback. The game makes good use of the controller's haptics — you feel every landing, ollie, and grind, giving the experience a more tactile feel. The adaptive triggers are only really used when performing reverts, but there's a satisfying resistance as you do so. Elsewhere, the game runs flawlessly at 4K and 60 frames-per-second, although we did run into one random crash during our testing. We should also mention the game makes good use of Activity Cards, allowing you to hop straight into Free Skate, multiplayer, and other modes, skipping the usual title screens. Oh, and the loading times are definitely reduced, though not completely eliminated.Overall, we'd say this is a decent upgrade that makes effective use of PS5's capabilities. However, if you're yet to grab Sony's new machine, the PS4 version will serve you just fine until you do.

Ever hopeful that the Burnout series makes a miraculous return.Comments (13)The haptics are a bit of a letdown for me. I was hoping that it would go for feeling like an actual skateboard on different terrains but it just feels a bit like normal rumble.@nessisonett Agreed; the haptics seem to be a missed opportunities with PS5 games so far, but I think when development normalizes (i.e. system attach rate increases), we'll start seeing improvements in that regard. Also I find the trigger effects to be a hinderance on competitive games (THPS, COD Online, Etc.)The revert resistance is NOT a welcome addition, it makes pulling one off that much harder and inconsistent in practice. I’ve never had an issue with triggers or haptics negatively impacting my experience so this is a first. A positive is the performance in split screen co-op has improved tremendously! If I hadn’t bought the digital deluxe edition on sale this upgrade wouldn’t be worth $10 extra@KonkeyDong64 I’ve skated for years and honestly the haptics in certain games totally remind me of the feeling in your legs when you bomb a hill. It’s a shame that the haptics weren’t as great as they really could have been and if VV hadn’t been shuttered then I’d be hopeful that a new game or remake of 3 could improve on them.With games like this that require spot on timing I turn off the haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, they make my inputs less precise. Same goes with fighting games.Also, thanks for all the free trophies!oh c'mon Activision other Company's gave an upgrade for nowt..............now you expect people to pay you more money for more crashes(no kneepads won't soften the blow) and a slight Rumble jeesus just so wrong...hand it over to the original team.The main question is, is this worth the £10 upgrade? It certainly doesn’t sound like it so far 😕Flawless performance and occasional crashes contradict each other@Jeevz free trophies? I had some trophy prgress on the PS4 version before downloading and playing the PS5 version but none of my trophies popped. This is my first time playing a game that was upgraded from PS4 to PS5 so figured the trophy thing wasn’t a big deal...Did you upload your save on PS4 and Download that save on PS5?Not worth the 10 bucks to upgrade.How is the 120 fps mode?Thanks for the honest review!

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2,John-Paul Jones,PlayStation Universe,https://www.psu.com/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-review-ps5-the-best-skater-ever-made-gets-even-better/," John-Paul Jones / March 25, 2021Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 PS5 review. With support for native 4K visuals at 60 frames per second, a high framerate mode at 120 frames per second, faster loading times and DualSense support, few of us in September 1999 would imagine that Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater and it’s sequel would be reborn in quite so an eye-opening fashion as it has here.As such like other similar PS5 upgrade critiques, this review will be more focused on the technical changes and improvements that the PlayStation 5 version of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 brings to the table. For the complete skinny on the gameplay and mechanics of Tony Hawk’s 1 + 2, you can catch our original PS4 review right here.Boasting smooth 60 frames per second visuals in its last-gen incarnation, it’s fair to say that quite unlike other PS5 upgrades, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 was already something of an extremely accomplished technical prospect on PS4. On PS5 though, the ante is upped yet further still, allowing players to experience the furious grinds, kickflips and ollies of both games in a razor sharp native 4K resolution presentation. This is quite simply the best that either of the Tony Hawk’s games have ever looked.In addition to offering a massive bump in resolution, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 also allows players who are lucky enough to have a HDMI 2.1 compliant display to enable performance mode, which allows both games to run at a liquid smooth 120 frames per second. As you might expect the trade off for such a significant leap in framerate comes in the form of a resolution drop, which in the case of both games causes the resolution to fall to around 1080p.Ultimately though, it all depends on what trade off you favour. As it stands, both games were already super smooth and responsive on PS4 and PS4 Pro, but the leap to 120 frames per second makes the game feel even more effortless to play, with the long-running combos consisting of grinds, kickflips, ollies and so forth all proving super satisfying to pull off.Further Reading – All PS5 Games That Support 120 FPS – The Smoothest Games On PlayStation 5On the flipside, the drop to 1080p does erase some of the fine detail that the native 4K/60 FPS presentation manages to accentuate. After all, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 was and is widely considered to be one of the best remakes of the last few years, so if you want to keep all that beautiful detail intact, including the high detail textures, reflections and so forth, it’s completely understandable that you would want to stick with the resolution focused mode. Really, there are no losers here.Away from the visual improvements, the usual array of PS5 upgrades are also present and accounted for here. Loading times are now much faster than ever before; not only allowing you cold boot the game up quickly but more crucially, enabling you to restart a level in just a second or two. Quite honestly, I cannot underscore how much of a boon the latter is – especially if you’re trying to nail a specific set of tasks and keep failing. Like me.As expected, the DualSense controller is also brought into the fold too, with the haptic feedback doing its thing and emanating a low rumble as you grind across rails, while crashes and more forceful impacts in the game world create a much more palpable degree of feedback. Elsewhere, the adaptive triggers also come into play, providing ample tension and resistance as you hit reverts, fakies and nollies – something which might annoy Tony Hawk’s veterans who prefer to not deal with that sensation during competitive play.Thankfully though this is something of a non-issue, as Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 on PS5 allows players to enable or disable both the haptic feedback and adaptive trigger functionalities of the DualSense controller according to preference.In the end, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 on PlayStation 5 is a more refined version of one of the best skater titles ever made. Though it’s a touch a disappointing that you need to pay the extra few bucks to own the deluxe version of the game in order to get the PS5 upgrade (especially when other titles demand no such additional premium), Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 absolutely shines on PlayStation 5 and this is arguably the definitive way to play both legendary games.The best skating game ever just became even more essential on PlayStation 5.Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 releases for PS5 on March 26th, 2021.Review code kindly provided by PR.Placing a level of sheen on an already stellar effort, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 on PlayStation 5 is arguably the definitive version of the best two skater titles ever released.

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2,Eric Hauter,Gaming Nexus,https://www.gamingnexus.com/Article/6187/Tony-Hawke28099s-Pro-Skater-1-2b-2/,"It is time for a serious Gaming Nexus confession: I never played the original Tony Hawk Pro Skater. I also never played Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2. My time with the original PlayStation was extensive, and the river of games I played ran deep and wide. But somehow I managed to sleep on this series until one day in the early 2000s when I picked up a used copy of Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 on PS3 for five bucks at a local burrito shop (yes, the burrito shop had a used game area, RIP Talitas).Flailing around and bailing over and over again on the first level, I was immediately intrigued and hooked. Why was this game so damn hard? How could anyone possibly pull off some of these ludicrous challenges? Why were those letters just floating in the sky, and how could anyone feasibly get up there to get them? Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 was one of the rare times in my life where I actually exercised some patience with a game, settling in to master some tricks and get good.I ended up living pretty exclusively in Tony Hawk land for about a month. After I beat every challenge in Tony Hawk 3 (I would have gotten a platinum on that bad boy, if such things existed), I made another trip back to the burrito shop for Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4 on GameCube. Adjusting to the different controller and the new flow of the game was a bit of a hassle, but before long I settled in and beat every challenge in that game too. Then I just stopped.I never picked up another Tony Hawk game. I had vague intentions of trying out American Wasteland, and I watched in dismay as my oldest son wasted his Christmas wishes one year by asking for Tony Hawk Ride, the gaming abortion that came with a non-functional plastic skateboard peripheral. But I never went back. I figured that no games released would ever top the glories that I experienced with Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 + 4, and I felt no need to sully those memories with some substandard nonsense.So here I am, nearly 20 years later. From my perspective, Activision just dropped the world's best sequel from the sky right into my lap. To me, Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1 + 2 is my long awaited follow up to Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 + 4. And what a glorious follow up it is.Some of my happiest gaming memories are of sitting for hours playing Tony Hawk, trying the same two-minute level over and over again, attempting to get a “Sick” score. This new version of Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1 + 2 replicates that experience, and I’ve lost just enough of my skills to need to work for my high scores again. It can't be overstated how addictive this game loop is. I've gone hours on end, with no idea how much time has gone by. I've stayed up nights, well after my wife and kids have gone to sleep, only to wake everybody up with my shouts of triumph when I finally pull of a combo I've been trying to master. This game is a thumb blister-inducing blast.For the uninitiated, Tony Hawk games typically consist of about 10 levels. Levels tend to be sprawling areas, with tons of ramps, rails, pools to skate on, and lots of secrets to discover. Players run through the level with two minutes on the clock, attempting to complete as many of the level’s goals as they can. If you run out of time, you simply start again. Goals can be anything from hitting a given score, to finding hidden objects, to performing specific tricks on specific obstacles. Goals range from very simple to viciously difficult. Get ready to hit that restart button a lot, but also prepare for moments of absolute triumph when you pull off that magical run you’ve been attempting for hours on end.Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1 + 2 is an enormous game, and not just because the geniuses at Vicarious Visions took two sizable games and spliced them together. Simply doing that and giving the game a facelift would have been more than enough to ensure success. But Vicarious and Activision went much further than that, adding a ton of structure and goodies to the experience.Yes, if you want to, you can simply play through shiny new versions Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1 and Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 in order and be done. But you would be missing out on some of the very clever design choices that have been added in. For starters, any skill points your skater picks up in either game carry over to the other. This centralized progression allows players to dip back and forth between the two games, building their skater up further than was previously possible before facing the game’s late challenges. This lends a cohesiveness to the entire experience, making it feel more like one game than like two separate titles that have been welded together.Every original concept in the game has been expanded and modernized in a way that displays taste, care, and fidelity to the spirit of the original titles. New skaters have been added to the roster, and original skaters have been aged to appear the way they would now. New songs by current artists have been added to the amazing soundtrack, and they fit in exactly the way they should in the rotation, sounding like they had always been there. Online leaderboards have been instituted for Free Skate modes, allowing players to not only chase their own high scores, but the world’s.Moves that were introduced later in the series have been added in, allowing the muscle memory of fans like me that only played the subsequent games to still be viable. An entirely new system—challenges—has been added in, to give players of all skill levels something to strive for beyond each level’s goals. The depth of new additions makes the game feel fresh and modern—everything from current clothing options in the in-game store to advertisements on billboards for Beats by Dre.But one thing that hasn’t changed is the insanely tight gameplay that the series is known for. Tony Hawk games (the good ones, at least) are some of the most precise, reactive games in history. You press a button, and your character moves exactly as intended. The game shows you everything you need to know to succeed in its tutorial, but the only way to truly succeed is to learn how to use the tools in your kit together. That takes practice. If you’ve never played a Tony Hawk game before, get ready for one of the most rewarding learning curves you’ve ever experienced.Out of curiosity, I threw Tony Hawk 4 in the old GameCube and was surprised at how easily the moves I’ve relearned in this new game translate over to the older one. These games feel the same, and that’s a huge testament to the quality of work that Vicarious Visions put in for this remake. Yes, the visuals are modern, and some of the references have been updated, but Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1 + 2 feels like an O.G. Tony Hawk game. It turns out that you can go home again.* The product in this article was sent to us by the developer/company.Howdy.  My name is Eric Hauter, and I am a dad with a ton of kids.  During my non-existent spare time, I like to play a wide variety of games, including JRPGs, strategy and action games (with the occasional trip into the black hole of MMOs).

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2,Kai Powell,Wccftech,https://wccftech.com/review/tony-hawks-pro-skater-12-feeling-younger-in-my-mind/,"Realistic skateboarding games have been all the rage of recent years, from EA’s long-running Skate series to the Early Access release of Skater XL that graced PC not too long ago. But, just as there’s an arcade-y, exaggerated of nearly every other sports discipline on the market, so too is there something for the world of skateboarding. For two decades now, that has been the Tony Hawk series. The Birdman hasn’t had the best of luck with recent releases, from the HD Remix that failed to capture critical and fan acclaim to the Ride series that cluttered GameStop back rooms with plastic board accessories. When I heard that Vicarious Visions and Activision were dusting off the old skate deck with a new release, I was apprehensive at first, but needless to say, there’s no reason to fear Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2.Just about the full roster of what you remember from the first two Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater titles are available in this fully remade package. That includes Goldfinger’s Superman, Bucky Lasek, School and School II, the 900 special trick, and more. When it comes to picking your skater, you have around twenty pro skaters at your disposal, from the original cast of the first two THPS titles as well as a number of new skaters like Leticia Bufoni and Nyjah Huston. As for what didn’t make the cut? Well, you’re looking at three songs that couldn’t be part of the soundtrack (but Vicarious Visions did add in thirty-seven new tracks), and Spider-Man, who would’ve been a killer exclusive on PlayStation 4 but that licensing deal was probably only made with the original Neversoft developer on PlayStation 1.The campaign to Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2 isn’t too different from what you’d expect from the respective PlayStation 1 titles. Each title is in its own separate dropdown menu once you boot up the game, leaving the possibility open for expanding the experience with DLC from the other Pro Skater entries.Whether you’re jumping into Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 or 2 first, you’re going to have to tackle a similar set of challenges. Each level, starting from the famous Warehouse and School titles in the first game, is set up similarly to one another. Not only will players have two minutes to achieve a certain score, but there are a great number of collectibles tucked away in each stage. For the Warehouse stage, this includes collecting all five SKATE letters, a couple of stat points for your chosen skater, and smashing through five crates. Most of the collectible goals have to be achieved in a single run, so this turns THPS into a different type of two-minute experience as you run around trying to collect what you can or hit certain gaps with a specific trick.Everything you do in the career mode, even if you don’t score enough to earn a medal in the Competition levels, feeds into a universal skater level that rewards the player with cosmetics for skater and board alike. Far more exhaustive than the individual level challenges are a great number of challenges that have the player master every trick in their arsenal, or at least use them enough (expect to hit 10,000 of each grab/lip/grind trick if you want to earn them all). There’s also an in-game item shop where players can put forth a bit of virtual cash into purchasing shoes, grip tape, and other skater essentials (again, earned by challenges. While there is paid DLC like the Call of Duty Endowment United Pack and Digital Deluxe Upgrade, there isn’t much else to spend real world currency on in Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2 yet).There’s a very specific feel to the way a board handles in the original Tony Hawk titles, from how much air you get from a flatland Ollie to the rotations of your skater once you sail off a half pipe. Needless to say, Vicarious Visions has nailed that signature feel down to an exact science and transitioning from a mid-air grab to grinding a rail and finishing it off with a combo-linking revert just feels *right*.Not everything in Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2 is exactly the same as you might remember from the original PlayStation days but that’s an instance where this remaster exceeds the original. New to the first two Tony Hawk titles are the addition of Reverts and Manuals, both features that weren’t introduced until later games. A Revert, performed by hitting R2 once your skater lands from the air, lets them switch their stance upon hitting the ground. The other new trick, Manual, can be done by quickly tapping down then up, or up then down if you want the reverse, letting your skater glide forward on the front or rear sets of wheels. Both of these moves can be used to continue a combo chain once you hit the ground running, allowing the player to continue a combo multiplier that just gets astronomically higher as more tricks are performed.If you want to absolutely cheat the scoring system, transition into a Manual, Grab your board twice to get into a Handstand position, then keep tapping the Flip button to repeat this simple trick that just compounds the scoring multiplier the more you pull it off. There’s a need to keep yourself balanced while performing a Manual but you can just Ollie off the ground and end the combo if you think you’re close to bailing.There are also two additional Legacy control schemes available in Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2 but I want to use that term loosely. Neither change the fundamental controls for your skater but instead change the moveset that’s available to your skater. If you want the pure THPS1 experience, this disables some of the core features like Manuals, Reverts, Wall Plants, and a number of other features that weren’t available in the original release. THPS2 offers a similar change up to the moves but still allows for Manuals and Stance Switching (but no Reverts).If hitting the high scores in each run is too difficult for you, or if you want to just enjoy the game at an easier pace, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2 does offer a number of Assists in place to help you stay at peak performance. These offer the ability for perfect balance on anything that would otherwise require fumbling with the balance meters, or even the ability to never fail a trick. Once enabled, these do disable a majority of challenges and in-game achievements but consider them to be a good set of training wheels to get the feel for how to properly manipulate your board when it comes time to hit the ground running.If the on-disc skate parks and challenges aren’t enough for you and you don’t have a buddy nearby to do some split-screen multiplayer, why not take a spin at the online offerings in Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2? There’s quite a bit of online modes to choose from, from Jams and Competitive playlists, to Combo Mambo and It. Once you're loaded into a lobby and level, you can choose stick with the same group for multiple sessions and stages, just in case you aren't feeling like jumping out after every minute or two. Strangely, my old favorite H.O.R.S.E. Is only available in local multiplayer and can’t be played online. Also, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2 offers the full Create a Park experience that’s been a staple of the series since the second THPS. If you want to see just how dumb/awesome you can make your own Skate Park, just check out ‘Roller Coast’ on the map browser.Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2 is the first remake I’ve played in some time that’s completely nailed the feel of the original releases while still turning the finished project into something brand new. Perhaps the closest I could come to is Bluepoint’s work with Shadow of the Colossus and other milestones in gaming achievement, but the difference is that Bluepoint does their best to make these new releases faithful to the source material. No, what Activision and Vicarious Visions have done is found a damn fine reason to bring skateboarding back in vogue for an entirely new generation of hopefuls. Consider Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2 to be the X Games of skateboarding titles. There isn’t anything else that even comes close, perhaps for a possible Vicarious Visions-led remake of the other titles in Tony Hawk’s bag of tricks.Reviewed on PlayStation 4 Pro (code provided by the publisher).Though some of the skaters might be past their prime, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2 is an incredible example of how some classics just never go out of styleThe links above are affiliate links.

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2,Stephen Tailby,Push Square,http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/tony_hawks_pro_skater_1_plus_2,"GuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpTony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 22020 8.1Game RatingUser Ratings: 41Our Review: Scroll DownBack to the old grindVersion Reviewed: PS4 (Standard) / EuropeanRepublished on Wednesday 27th July 2022: We're bringing this review back from the archives following the announcement of August's PlayStation Plus lineup. The original text follows.Tony Hawk's Pro Skater is a series that defined early PlayStation just as much as Crash Bandicoot or Tomb Raider. The games are fondly remembered for their tight controls, licensed soundtracks, and endlessly replayable levels, although the franchise has certainly bailed a few times as well. Never fear, though, because Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is a triumphant return to form.Combining the first and second games into one package, this full-blown remake is a nollie flavoured nostalgia trip that will have old fans doing 900 degree spins in delight. As soon as you start playing, the controls feel absolutely spot on. It might take a minute to get back into the rhythm, but skating around and pulling off ridiculous tricks is just as fun as you remember from 20 years ago. It really does nail the handling, and frankly, that's half the battle won. Unlike the original two games, you have access to gameplay enhancements from later titles, such as spine transfers and the all-important revert. These moves allow you to keep combos going for miles, and landing a huge line of tricks is of course extremely satisfying. It feels particularly good at 60 frames-per-second, even if load times do take their sweet time.But there's more than just the wonderfully tight controls to enjoy. Each of the 19 levels from the original games are presented here in glorious form. The visual overhaul and attention to detail on display is brilliant, with most stages given a dramatic new look. It goes without saying the graphics are a huge improvement on the originals, but so much care has been taken on each map to give them all a unique identity. School and School II are now radically different from each other, Venice Beach doubles down on the graffiti, and Mall now looks like something out of The Last of Us. It's a seriously impressive effort.What's more, every level has had something added to it. This is most noticeable with the Tony Hawk 1 stages, where all the stages have more objectives to bring them in line with Tony Hawk 2. At the very least, each map now has a couple more gaps to find. It means that even veteran players will have something new to see and do, and that's to say nothing of the hundreds of challenges that'll keep completionists busy for a long time.That leads us to some structural changes that make the collection more cohesive. Stat points for each character are now collectibles scattered across the game, and instead of picking up cash icons, money is earned simply through completing objectives and beating challenges. You'll also earn XP and level up, which in turn unlocks more and more cosmetic items with which to customise your own skater. It does seem a bit limiting that these items can't be used with pro skaters, but it does at least encourage you to experiment with making a custom character. All these different metrics might sound confusing, but everything feeds into rewarding the player in some way, and it makes the game feel more modern.Speaking of modern, online play is pretty seamlessly integrated. You can easily start a session with friends or join a public lobby, and engage in all the multiplayer modes you remember, like Graffiti and Trick Attack. Local multiplayer is an option, too, where two skaters can enjoy some split-screen action.As well as creating your own skater, Create A Park returns, and it's more robust than ever. You can place all manner of ramps, rails, and other objects, then share your masterpiece with the community. However, there's more to it than just dropping in half pipes and funboxes; you can use smart pieces to create truly custom parks. Placing one of these down, you can then modify them in various ways, leading to totally unique obstacles. It's kind of fiddly to use, but with some practice, you could easily make some fun maps using these tools.Meanwhile, the soundtrack contains nearly all the music you remember while adding lots of new songs to the mix. While it's a shame that not all the songs from the originals are here, the vast majority of new additions fit right in. You can change what will show up in the playlist, but we left everything on as we enjoyed the variety. Among the skate punk and hip hop is some rap and pop music that somehow all hits the right tone.There's so much packed into this game that it can all feel a little daunting at first. As you begin your arcadey skating career, you'll see a bunch of challenge notifications, your level increasing, cash racking up — it's a lot to keep track of. However, everything is smartly presented, and once you get used to the game's structure, it offers lots of reasons to keep playing. There are secret skaters to unlock, hidden areas to access, and more. It just about balances the old school feel with more up-to-date features, meaning both old and new fans should be satisfied.Vicarious Visions has produced another excellent remake with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2. It brings those PS1 classics to the modern era with a wonderful visual upgrade, rock solid performance, and all the features you'd expect of a game released in 2020. Most importantly, though, it retains the specific feel of the franchise at its best, delivering an addictive, fast-paced, arcade-like experience. Old fans can rest easy knowing that the Tony Hawk games are back on form, while new players can dive into the skateboarding world for the first time.

I bought this after the first round of reviews popped up, and I have to agree with your takes 100%! The game feels fresh, even as I play and am like, ""Oh yeah....I remember this map!"" It's pretty cool being able to relive the past, especially when it's this well put together. My skills from back then, though? I need a bit of polishing up.Well to be fair, the pro skaters have extra costumes to unlock and unique board decals. And unlocking them also unlocks them for your custom skater which is nice.And yeah, the Mall reminded me of TLOU too. Half expected a Clicker to start chasing me with all the noise I was making smashing through windows.Brilliant, so looking forward to getting my hands on this! Way more hyped for this than anything else this year 😅This game has occupied my thoughts while away from it more than I thought I would. Not since middle school have I been this hooked on a Tony Hawk game.Sounds so good. Activision doesn't get enough credit for its excellent remake record this gen!My Tony Hawk skills are not what they once were. Haha.I’ve played an hour or so and I seem to have mastered face planting more than anything else. Haha.I’m really enjoying this, but I’m way rusty from back then.@get2sammyb I can't agree more. It's got to the point where the old discussion between what's a remake and what's a remaster has been blurred by the quality job that Activision have doneThis game is amazing. Like 10/10 amazing for me. My muscle memory is remarkably intact from the hundreds of hours i poured into the originals, and i couldnt be happier to jump back in.This game is pure noatalgia. But its also more than that. Its a game that you can drop in and out of at your leisure. The two minute rounds lend themselves well to fitting into short gaming sessions. And yet the game also nails that 'just one more go' feeling which sees you sat there for an hour, 2 hours, 3 hours and wondering where the time has gone.A triumphant success and a huge well done to Vicarious Visions and ActivisionCan't wait to get my copy. It's been years since I've played a Tony Hawk game.I think the last TH game I've played was Underground.Picked this up on Friday morning and barely stopped playing it since.An absolutely fantastic remake and very faithful to the originals.I've always kept my ps3 wired up in the bedroom so that I could pop the old Ps1 discs in whenever it took my fancy. All I need now is for gta 1 to be somehow released for modern consoles then I can finally retire my ps3The 1 thing that let's it down for me is, after you tick of anything from any level, thats it! You can't reply the same level with another character looking to collect SKATE for e.g.Other than that, yes it's a solid 8/10I think somehow, contrary to what others have said, my muscle memory has remained intact for this game. I opened it up and was pulling off 200k combos right away. Quick tip for everyone is that when you are in a manual or grind, you can change the style loads in quick succession by mashing the top 3 face buttons, I think for manuals ∆∆, OO, ∆O, O∆, ∆[], []∆ all change the manual and [][] does some sort of flip while you are doing the manual. Racks up the points quickly!@Quintumply cheers for the write up! I ended up caving and buying it after the review round up posted here on Thursday. I finished the main campaigns and I'll see what else it has to offer. I think this game made me a feel a bit up and down. Up because it's awesome and down because I am still playing the same game I played as a ten year old. Really weird feeling! It's probably because I played these games for months/years back then and I literally just finished it in 2 days this time. I'm going to have a go at some other modes during the week, see what else there is to do on it!@get2sammyb it's really weird that I've booted up 4 Activision games in the past few years (crash, spyro, CTR and this) considering I haven't touched (for any meaningful amount of time) an Activision game since the original Tony hawks series!@pip_muzz I think for me (and I know people will disagree), a port is just a straight port, a remaster is like an unlocked port on full settings (some stuff may be changed but overall it's the same) like Turok, star wars episode 1 racer or the PS3 HD collections and a remake is a significant overhaul, either with gameplay or just graphics or both, so I'd classify this (and crash n
Sane trilogy) as a remake because its not just a HD port. A reboot is something that just takes influence from the original but goes in its own direction like Tomb Raider.Why O’ why did they remove the separate goals for each skater. That’s where the replayability was.Really bummed me out. You do the goals once and they are done. Really rubbish decision to change that.Hope the patch them back in.You should have to do goals as each skater if you are that way inclined it’s why we played the first versions for monthsI’d seriously take two points off for that decision. It’s killed my buzz completely. Did the first two levels and wanted to go back and change skaters and do them again before moving on and you can’t. Really rubbish decision.This would be a 8/9 if it wasn’t for that. For me it’s a 6/7 as this will not be one you keeping coming back.If they remake ssx 3 they better not pull the same nonsenseGreat game and great review, although I'm not sure if the listed Cons deserve a docking of 2 full stars.My copy should be arriving soon. Looking forward to it cause this game looks spectacular. @Stocksy well you suckWhat about decks? Can you unlock a variety of cool decks for your board for any character?I asked elsewhere, but didn't get an answer. Is the online on this actually functional, or is it like CTR and is just broken? Because it seems to be quite an important part of this. I can't wait to get my grubby little mitts on it and relive my childhood.It is fun. I know I’m banging the drum but SSX! SSX@ralphdibny Hahaha you’ve just described my high score strategy on THPS3 and 4! Manuals with handstands, flips and pogo can fair rack up the points.@nessisonett lol, I reckon thps4 is where I first learned it!@ralphdibny Man, i could honestly kiss you. I couldnt remember how to pogo, etc... from manuals. It was driving me insane. Completley forgot you could adjust the manual/grind with the face buttons.This is the second 2020 made game I have purchased (after Animal Crossing) and I am reliving lots of old memories.Not only is this a polished remake of 2 games in one, but the fact Activision asked for $40 instead of $60 sealed the deal for me.@Stocksy @Dreamscape20 You can do a speedrun with a character. That's a mode where it times you to get all goals in a level. There's a par time to beat (e.g. 2 minutes for Warehouse) and a hard time to beat (e.g. 1 minute for Warehouse - yes all goals in just 60 seconds 😭) but you can of course just do all goals at your leisure as the timer rolls on.It's everything I wanted and more. I'm especially happy how they doubled the number of objectives in the first game and added so many challenges in general. I can't imaging this remake being more perfect (other than including THPS3).Can the directional pad still be used instead of analogue sticks?@Arnna yep, i am only using the dpad. Analogue sticks feel too imprecise for me for this type of game!@Weebleman my goodness! Well I'm glad I can be of some help at least 😅@Rob_230 thank god for that@zimbogamer Each pro has specific decks to unlock that only they and any custom skaters can use. Then the custom skater has an absolute sh*tload of decks to unlock that only they can use. Also you unlock different wheels, grip tape, clothes, logos (for your profile and clothing) and even new parts for the Create-a-Park mode. You can also change your trucks but can't unlock new ones as far as I can see.@Quintumply Do the remakes let us play as Spider-Man, or was he removed because Activision no longer has the licensing rights?Awsome games.spent hours playing these as a kid but remember being alot better than i am now tho 🙈. Guessing old man reactions are kicking in now.@KidBoruto No Spider-Man. Not unless it's an incredibly well kept secret. You can unlock Officer Dick and an alien, as far as I know. The closest you'll get to being Spider-Man is a web pattern for your grip tape.@Kidfunkadelic83 I've been watching a skater play it on YouTube and he's played all the games regularly since they came out. He's a lot better than me but he did say that the characters are heavier, yet they move faster, and that the balance metres seem to degrade faster. And this is a guy that's played some of the games that were hacked so you have 0 in all stats - so he's used to it being a challenge but it still stood out to him.@Matroska oh yeah it defenately feels faster@KidBoruto Yeah, Spider-Man isn't in the remake unfortunately.@Quintumply @Matroska That's unfortunate, but here's hoping Spider-Man can be added later as DLC.Be warned, this game has a new coat of plaint and far better frame rate, BUT the old school jankiness and questionable physics remain exactly the same. As a result it’s not easy to just ‘slip back into’ your old high scores and skill level.
