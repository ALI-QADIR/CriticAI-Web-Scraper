He pauses before a cryostasis control panel and, of all the thousands of scientists and engineers he could've thawed out, for some reason he chooses me: a janitor called Pippin with a twirly moustache and a wonky moral compass.This is the beginning of a quirky romp across a solar system ruled by brutal corporations. The Outer Worlds is a light-hearted RPG that aims to emulate the Firefly fantasy. You fly from planet to planet, gather a crew of misfits, pick your way through a series of moral quandaries, and shoot people with cool laser guns.The game's retrofuturistic aesthetics and dark sense of humour pitches The Outer Worlds against Bethesda's Fallout games, but there are important differences. True, you have ray guns, and companions who will shoot enemies and stand around staring awkwardly into walls, but this game isn't a sprawling sandbox experience. You hop between planets and space stations, exploring fairly large (and very pretty) zones full of corporate employees staving off plagues and wild animal attacks. Each area is loaded with loot and sidequests, but it's a tight and prescriptive RPG. You fetch science fiction gadgets for quest givers and make some entertaining moral decisions.That's not a bad thing, but in a world of 70-hour RPGs it's useful to set expectations. The Outer Worlds is a pulpy choose-your-own-adventure experience. If you don't go in expecting a deep systems-driven sandbox, it's a pleasure to breeze through.There's still plenty to tinker with. When you level up you get ten points to pour into your character's stat sheet. I went all-in on my handgun competency to pay homage to Obsidian's cult spy RPG Alpha Protocol, but you can also put stock in personality traits like perception and intelligence to unlock extra conversation options. I recommend that. Pippin the space janitor is an exceptional liar, which means I can mess with corporate stooges in entertaining ways.You can also mod weapons to add sights, improve their ammo capacity or, most importantly, change their damage type. There's a loose rock paper scissors system to combat. Energy weapons mess up animals, electric weapons mess up robots, and pretty much anything messes up humans. You don't really have to care about that if you don't want to, however. For hand-wavy science reasons you can slow down time and easily line up headshots. You can equip melee weapons too, and if you unlock the right skills there's a light parry system that lets you block precisely to rebound opponents.Combat isn't challenging, and enemies fit into worn categories—face rush melee types, sniper types, dog types. But the Jetsons-style sci fi weapons are fun to use and battles are frequently hilarious. Enemies explode into chunks with enthusiasm, often while screaming overwrought barks. It's entertaining even when it goes wrong. I blew a man's head clean off and he fell over screaming ""aaaaargh my eyes, I can't see!"" I've encountered a bunch of other amusing RPG contrivances. I looted money, light, ammo, drugs, and an entire mining suit from a man's dismembered right leg.The corporate colonies are full of employees keen to do the best job they can—largely because getting fired can mean exile and death.Fights exist to put some light friction between meetings with The Outer World's oppressed but surprisingly merry citizens. The corporate colonies are full of employees keen to do the best job they can—largely because getting fired can mean exile and death. The story winds between pockets of people trying their best to survive. The game's main dilemmas ask you to side with one faction against another. You're free to play the freedom fighter or a corporate shill, but quest outcomes are frequently messy and unexpected. Along with multiple endings, that gives the game some replayability.Your companions have their own stories too. They aren't as meaningful as, say, Mass Effect's companions, but they regularly chip in on conversations. The voice acting is great, but NPCs and companions can seem stilted and unmoving during conversations. There's also some extremely aggressive zoom when you initiate conversation, which takes me all the way back to the looming potato faces of Oblivion.For the most part the game ran beautifully on a GTX970. There were occasional stutters and quick texture popping upon loading into a new area. Barring menu controls, all other keys are rebindable and the game controls well on a mouse and keyboard setup, especially because you can use number keys to quickly select dialogue options. For a full breakdown of settings and hardware requirements, check out our Outer Worlds performance analysis (opens in new tab).It's still a fun journey. The advantage of the planet-hopping structure—rather than have a single contiguous wasteland to explore—is variety. It's a colourful universe full of excellent lumpen spaceships that remind me of Red Dwarf. You journey through improbable sci-fi landscapes, brightly lit space stations, and robot-infested facilities. I love the design though some minor texture popping in larger areas took me out of the moment at points.There's a category of games I think of as Saturday morning cartoon games. They lack depth, but they are fluffy and easy to enjoy. As I look back on some screenshots as Pippin laser blasts a poor marauder into a pile of dust, I realise that's what The Outer Worlds is to me. If you meet it on those terms, I think you'll enjoy it.An entertaining, uncomplicated RPG in colourful universe.Part of the UK team, Tom was with PC Gamer at the very beginning of the website's launch—first as a news writer, and then as online editor until his departure in 2020.

The Outer Worlds,Edwin Evans-Thirlwell,Eurogamer,https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-10-22-the-outer-worlds-review-an-inward-looking-genre-piece-that-never-stretches-the-imagination,"Corp speed.The solar system of Obsidian's The Outer Worlds is swimming with comically evil corporate products: toothpaste that causes blindness, hangover cures that induce comas, each with its jaunty advertising catchphrase and baleful barbershop jingle. Compared to that trove of terrors, the corporate product that is The Outer Worlds itself is kind of like a posh cup-a-soup. It's far from haute cuisine, or especially nutritious - the packaging probably accounts for a solid 30 per cent of the calories - but it goes down easily enough and it won't do you any damage. It's fine, is Outer Worlds. There's nothing I really loathe about it, the tedium of looting aside, and nothing I really love about it either. If you read the sales pitch ""Maker of Fallout: New Vegas makes Fallout-tinted cover version of Mass Effect"" and broke your thumb on the pre-order button, rest assured that this is broadly that. But what else could it have been? The game begins eccentrically enough. The Outer Worlds unfolds in an alternate universe where the USA never passed some critical anti-trust legislation, and humanity is accordingly owned and operated by vast corporations. Your custom-created character is a pioneer aboard the interstellar colony ship Hope, cast out toward the Halcyon system by the all-knowing hand of Profit Motive. Said hand then declines to revive you when the Hope turfs up, decades late, due to a drive malfunction. The system, you learn, has already been settled in your absence and transformed into a fungal, retro-futuristic Wild West, its planets dotted with flat-packed, hardscrabble townships of chrome and timber. It's a place of on-going resource wars and caricatured ideological tensions, with quasi-communist ""Philosophist"" rebels embedded on one moon and a trio of big companies tussling for preeminence. The last thing your employers need is another few hundred mouths to feed, particularly if those colonists then fall in with the lefties. Fortunately, you are sprung from cryosleep by motor-mouthed mad scientist (is there any other kind?) Dr Phineas Wells, who sends you on a quest to unfreeze the remainder of your crew. Among your first feats is to land an escape pod squarely on top of the mercenary captain Phineas has asked to be your chaperone. This frees you from oversight, while also giving you the keys to the mercenary's ship, the Unreliable, a cousin of Mass Effect's Normandy made entirely from trashcans and spit. This serves as your mobile homestead - complete with sarky AI landlord - as you explore Halcyon, undertaking main and optional quests, picking allegiances, unearthing ulterior motives and recruiting six companions to your cause. The two major planets consist of lavish open worlds with several landing sites. You'll spend the bulk of the game here, but there are also smaller areas such as asteroid hideaways, makeshift space bazaars, scorched mining facilities and prisons. Many landing sites must be unlocked by obtaining a pass, which turns The Outer Worlds into an interstellar game of Find the Keycard. You'll obtain these cards as part of the main story, which should last you 20-30 hours if you take your time.I had reasonably high expectations for The Outer Worlds' satire, after spending an hour with it this summer. These expectations were not met, though the writing has its moments. The premise is satisfyingly unceremonious, next to most other RPGs. It introduces you as spare goods, plucked at random from the left luggage locker, and endows you not with the usual Chosen One CV but a selection of blue-collar backstories such as bartender and factory loader. This puts you on the same footing as many of the colonists you'll meet, half of them contractually obliged to speak in advertising slogans; one conversation tree sees you pestering a miserable shopkeeper to say something, anything that's not in his script. There are some decent gags and moderately engrossing scenarios in play. Hackable terminals in the many gutted factories, outposts and laboratories you'll visit are full of emails about workplace abuses, blithe missives from HR, and passive-aggressive spats with coworkers. On one planet, there's a reformist rogue executive who speaks in self-care mantras; his nemesis, the daydreaming socialist across the valley, is a frustrated copywriter (I see you too, Obsidian).Sadly, though, the satire is more often cute than cutting. The game tries sporadically to explore the question of a corporate-run dystopia in earnest, typically by asking you to weigh the mutually exclusive claims of two factions, capitalist and anti-capitalist. But much of the time, the portrayal is too reliant on clichés sucked dry by Fallout and Bioshock. The bosses are invariably slick, silver-tongued and content to wallow in hypocrisy. The 50s-style ads that cover walls and loading screens are macabre in a predictable, adolescent way (each has its cheeky disclaimer detailing a range of horrible side effects). The people slaving under the corporate yoke are all folksy, can-do sorts who shave the grammatical subject from every sentence because dang it, there's no time for ""I"" when you're wearing your fingers to the bone on behalf of Johnny CEO. Most importantly, none of it makes much of an impact on your tools and tactics as player, beyond that eye-catching beginning. You could swap The Outer Worlds' social commentary elements for the peaks of Skyrim or Mordor and it would be exactly the same game, which is to say, one you've played many times before.There are a dozen or so skills to level up, with more specialised perks - such as a chance of resetting a companion's ability cooldown - to unlock every other level. You can mod your weapons and armour at worktables for tweaks like quieter footstep noise, and chug down a sizeable range of narcotics for a short-lived stat boost (and subsequent withdrawal symptoms). There are lots of variables, but it all boils down to four, millennia-old ways of role-playing: shooting, hacking, sneaking and talking people round to avoid conflict entirely. Generally, you'll make use of all of these approaches simultaneously, much as you might strive to define yourself as, say, a glib gunslinger or a brainiac with a tournament-class right hook. There's a slight claustrophobia to The Outer Worlds, for all its searing skyboxes and neon-striped roads winding in amongst hills of alien flora. There are too many ways of beating each quest per square metre. You'll discover key props or half-complete undiscovered quests in passing, and the different routes and means of reaching each waypoint are seldom far apart. You rarely have to really think about what you're doing, or exercise much curiosity about either the environments or the people that live within them - everything just sort of falls into place under your feet.Mind you, you'll be doing plenty of poking around. The Outer Worlds isn't quite as obsessed with loot as Fallout under Bethesda, not least because it doesn't support full object physics, but its landscapes brim nonetheless with containers and bricabrac. Even the homeliest shack in the wilderness is strewn with foodstuffs, weapon mods, equipment, ammo, drugs and sellable junk. You know that you need to sponge up some of the loot - much of it frustratingly tucked in amongst objects you don't want - to keep pace with the difficulty curve, but it's unclear what will prove essential down the line. So you end up gathering absolutely everything, till you hit your character's weight limit and dismantle/eat 50 per cent of your haul in frustration. The gunplay, at least, is smart and stylish enough to puncture the mounting boredom, thanks in no small part to a totally-not-VATS-inspired time-slowing ability that highlights the effects of targeting different body parts. The arsenal is a no-frills stew of pistols, rifles, heavy weapons and melee tools, but you'll need to match ammo types such as plasma or lightning to target vulnerabilities, which takes a bit of planning. It's never Bulletstorm, but it's a cut above mindless mayhem.Much of my apathy for The Outer Worlds' conventions is a question of taste, of course, and there are plenty of RPGs that do the same things worse. But all the same, do we really need another one of these? So much of this game feels like a formula on repeat, for all the charisma of its landscapes, which include some towering fields of Morrowindy mushrooms. Take companions, which, given Obsidian's previous achievements in this area, ought to be where the game is at its best. Your ship's AI is a feisty conversation partner, but your buddies in the field - a vicar, a gawky mechanic, a gun-slinging sawbones, an orphan boy, a battle mech and a bounty hunter - are weirdly interchangeable, even when not concealed beneath layers of armour. They have many lines of incidental dialogue, and offer different perspectives on key plot points. Max, the vicar, is on some level an obedient corporate stooge, while Ella, your medic, balances a brash exterior against a privileged upbringing. But they're oddly devoid of striking qualities once you get to know them, and I was never that interested in hearing their thoughts. Optional loyalty questlines aside, each character has their own potted skilltree and a secondary ability, which is rarely more complicated than dealing a big wodge of damage in one go.As the hours roll on, the objectives and encounters chain together without seam. People want stuff collecting and/or fixing and/or other people killing. The details vary - sometimes your employer is a wizened bounty-hunter whose friends are all dead, and sometimes it's a black market kingpin. Sometimes you're fetching ink for a printing press, and sometimes you're retrieving the targeting module from a crash-landed cruiser. Either way, it's the same waypoint, the same dependable buffet of sneaking, hacking, shooting or talking things through, and the same, slavish anti-climax of combing bins and corpses for goodies. You stop paying attention to concluding binary choices because it feels like there's very little, really, at stake, beyond some percentage points on the faction loyalty screen. I don't hate The Outer Worlds. Rather, what I hate about it is that it's sufficiently unhateful that you can spend 30 hours playing it without noticing. It's solidly-made enough that you keep hanging around in the hope of something more, like a layer of catchy percussion that never quite escalates into a song. I guess to sum things up, I would like two features to be added to the game. One is a powerful suction cannon with infinite extra-dimensional storage, so I can just gather all the loot in one fell swoop. The other is the option to hand off dialogue decisions to one of my companions, because I have no strong feelings either way, comrades. Let me do clean-up in the background, hosing down the level's crevices with one earbud in, following the conversation absent-mindedly. According to my own character's backstory as a janitor, that's exactly the part I was born to play.You're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!

The Outer Worlds,Joe Juba,Game Informer,https://www.gameinformer.com/review/the-outer-worlds/the-outer-worlds-review-good-company,"Your crew on the Unreliable are some of the best and brightest in Halcyon – but considering the sorry state of civilization in deep space, that isn’t saying much. Your compatriots include a religious zealot, a heavy drinker, a compulsive cleaning robot, and other imperfect individuals. However, despite their flaws, this plucky team can help you find remarkable and unconventional solutions to the colony’s biggest problems. Whether you want to heal a rift between warring factions or destabilize a governing body, the underdogs of the Unreliable can get it done.Like the misfits it features, The Outer Worlds finds inspiring success despite its rough edges. It has technical and visual quirks, and can veer dangerously close to feeling archaic, but these aren’t the qualities that define the game. Instead, The Outer Worlds distinguishes itself with a crumbling space colony controlled by cartoonishly evil corporate interests, then sets you and your party loose to explore, aid, and incite. Maybe that involves gunplay and innocent casualties – or maybe you can talk your way out of conflict altogether. The Outer Worlds finds brilliant and fun ways to blend signature aspects of well-known series like Fallout and Mass Effect; it is a space adventure featuring a likable cast and an irreverent-yet-dangerous frontier, with entertaining gameplay bridging the gaps. The single best part is the freedom you have in approaching the various problems plaguing Halcyon. The corporations have done a terrible job taking care of their workers/citizens, so you need to reroute power, recover salvage, and reconcile militant factions across various planets and space stations. As you try to address these issues, The Outer Worlds deftly presents options beyond simple “stealth or melee” scenarios; depending on how you build your character and which tasks you complete, you can pursue a wealth of available options with rewarding outcomes.In one case, I needed to access a high-security area in a government building. I found a woman who could sneak me in if I convinced her I was interested in a romantic rendezvous, or I could investigate a lunch-related feud between her and a coworker to win her over. Another option was simply stealing a disguise, which also required a silver tongue to divert suspicion if detected. Of course, I could have also opened fire and fought my way through, but I was so adept at lying and persuading that I usually only considered naked hostility as a last resort. This kind of flexibility makes The Outer Worlds especially satisfying, because no matter how you specialize, the team at Obsidian provides something clever to do apart from deciding how to kill folks.Though I often sought nonaggressive solutions, I had fun with combat when it happened. Again, the flavor of encounters changes based on how you’ve allocated your skill points. My first character was melee-focused, with lots of points invested in buffing my companions; eventually, they could handle most fights without me. For my second playthrough, I made a more active hero, specialized in handguns and rifles with perks spent on improving a tactical time-slowing power (similar to Fallout’s V.A.T.S. system). Regardless of your focus, the controls are responsive and feel great. I especially liked firing off my companions’ cinematic attacks.The crew of the Unreliable are solid traveling buddies, assuming you choose to recruit them. In different ways, they all struggle to find a place to belong in Halcyon, and I enjoyed getting to know them gradually through a mixture of conversations, ambient banter, and personal quests. However, these interactions are too sparse. What’s there is excellent; their dialogue and stories are well-done, and I like how most of them don’t fit neatly into established archetypes. But they can also feel oddly peripheral considering the time you spend with them by your side.Structurally, the game follows the blueprint established by classics like Knights of the Old Republic. You go to a planet or settlement, do some quests, and eventually make a bigger decision that determines the fate of the area. Over the course of my two playthroughs – one thorough, one fast – I saw these scenarios play out in different ways, and I was a bit disappointed at how black-and-white the options are. Most boil down to siding with a heartless corporation or a group of freedom-loving dissidents, though completing sidequests usually reveals an optimal third option, like bringing feuding groups together. This predictability diminishes the magnitude of the seemingly significant choices, and combined with the static explanation screens you get during the ending, this is an area where The Outer Worlds feels outdated.Even if the larger beats don’t always land, The Outer Worlds shines with a constant stream of small, bright moments. An amusing interaction with a clueless guard. A sugary corporate jingle. A brutal sneak attack. A solution to a problem you are sure won’t work, but it does. The team at Obsidian excels at encouraging creative experimentation within its responsive and absurd setting, ensuring that every visit to Halcyon is full of delightful surprises.

    Edmond Tran
   on January 16, 2020 at 5:29PM PSTThe Outer Worlds plays just like a Fallout game. That's a pretty tepid description and an obvious comparison. It's easy to take one look at the game, which strongly echoes the mechanical form of the Bethesda RPGs, and think you know what to expect. The developer, Obsidian Entertainment, was responsible for the cult-favorite Fallout: New Vegas after all. But The Outer Worlds doesn't just play like a Fallout game. It is, surprisingly, the best possible version of a Fallout game--a potent distillation of what made that series so beloved in the first place.The Outer Worlds adopts the most compelling innovations of modern Fallout games, emphasising immersive exploration and impactful, action-oriented combat in a game engine (Unreal Engine) that actually makes those things feel good by contemporary standards. It shares Fallout's satirical but incredibly bleak look at the future, but is free of its tired tropes. Critically, The Outer Worlds exhibits the same depth of soul as the early Interplay and Black Isle Fallout games (as well as other games in the '90s PC RPG genre) with a genuinely complex, interconnected narrative web of relationships and events that feel like they can change in a seemingly infinite number of ways based on the character you want to be, the variety of choices you can make, and the actions you take.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: The Outer Worlds Video ReviewGiven the studio and the key people responsible (original Fallout creators Tim Cain and Leonard Boyarsky), that last trait isn't surprising. But it's not the only element that makes The Outer Worlds an excellent space Western adventure--that's just the incredibly sound foundation that elevates the game's great world-building, wonderful characters, and multi-layered quest design, on top of punchy combat and consistently sharp writing.In The Outer Worlds, you are just one of the thousands of people left in hibernation on an abandoned colony ship, when a scientist of possibly ill repute frees you and enlists your help in saving the rest of your frozen peers. After a rigorous character creation process--involving a slew of variable attributes, perks, and aesthetic customization--you crash-land on a planet, alone, and from there, how you make your mark on the Halcyon system is up to you.The crux of this sci-fi setup is that, among other things, the Halcyon system is owned and run entirely by a board of corporations, and their presence is a big deal. Whole planets are owned by corps looking to use their ecosystems as part of a larger supply chain, and numerous vending machines from different companies populate towns, trying to attract you with their bright logos and jingles. In fact, The Outer Worlds is saturated with strikingly colourful locales; the planets you'll visit are impressively varied and sometimes beautiful, flaunting an H.G. Wells-like retro-futuristic aesthetic, the antithesis of grimdark cyberpunk.On the first impression, corporations appear as a mostly aesthetic layer folded into the world. A number of the companies mentioned seem to mostly just exist as manufacturers of weapons and consumables--a piece of flair to keep the tone light in the same way that the Circus of Values exists in BioShock, but it's far more ingrained than that. Corporate capitalism so deeply affects everything in The Outer Worlds, and explorations into how it can affect society on a variety of levels is a surprisingly well-considered constant, despite the semblance of parody. You'll meet sympathetic workers whose livelihoods are only made possible by offering themselves to exploitation and indentured servitude, white-collared outlaws who are more bureaucrats than pirates, and well-meaning middle-managers who are trying to change the corporate machine from the inside. You'll find moderates, idealists, extremists, and most things in between and around the fringes, all of which have their own feasible ideas about how to best serve the colony or themselves. By the time the climax hits, it's clear that The Outer Worlds has its own stance on this bleak future, but that doesn't stop the world it creates, the sojourns you take, and characters you meet along the way from being any less fascinating.There are plenty of characters in The Outer Worlds who I didn't like. Reed Tobson, for example, is a snivelling factory chief in the early hours of the game who I didn't have to think twice about undermining, and Felix, one of your potential companion characters, had such an annoyingly naive personality I avoided talking to him as much as possible. The Outer Worlds allows you to kill any character in the game (bar one), and the world will reshape and move on without them, but there's something to be said for game's depiction of its unappealing people, whose portrayal I admired despite my distaste. You'll talk to a lot of people in The Outer Worlds. How much you do is up to you--you're allowed to cut straight to get to the point or dive deeper--but chatting to the game's entire supporting cast of non-player characters is something that never gets tiring, even if you don't care for them, purely because of how strong the game's writing and vocal performances are.I never felt like I had to endure stretches of pointless or overly dramatic exchanges, both because of how focussed and subtle the script seemed to be, as well as the variety of response options for my player character which kept conversations flowing in largely natural ways. Numerous considerations for the world state let conversations take into account things you may or may not already have done throughout your campaign; brief and subtle injections of worldbuilding and lore stop conversation from being too matter of fact without losing the game's identity, and some exceptional low-key wit works very well in sparking a periodic laugh without humour feeling like a sticking point. Solid, consistent voice direction helps keep the tone firmly measured, meaning the hours you spend absorbing the world through its people are always engaging.Nowhere does the strength of the game's characters shine more strongly than in your companions, however (except for Felix; that guy is a weenie). You have the option to recruit six predetermined characters to accompany and assist you in your adventures, though the game does have tools to bolster a lone wolf character too. But having companions along for the ride is a delight, and that's, again, because of the strength of the character writing. Companions instantly feel like fleshed-out characters of their own accord, not like they simply exist to revolve around you. They'll converse privately with each other and chime in on conversations you have with other characters in the world, acting as sounding boards during key moments. They can, in extreme situations, leave you of their own accord if they strongly disagree with a course of action. It's all mechanically conditional, of course, but the illusion the game builds is so endearing--spending time with these folks feels just as valuable as your pursuing the overarching goal.Companions have their own customisable skill trees, equipment loadouts, combat tactics, and special abilities you can command them to use, which, with their cinematic camera angles, inspired battle cries, and useful status effects, never become unsatisfying to initiate. The other major tool at your disposal in combat, provided your character's weapon skills are high enough to use it, is Tactical Time Dilation (TTD)--a time-bending mechanic that slows the action to a crawl, allowing you to give yourself some breathing room in order to analyse enemies and take the time to execute precision attacks. Hitting certain locations on enemies will let you do things like cripple or maim them, or inflict weapon-specific effects like bleed damage or knocking them unconscious. Using TTD tactically to take out key targets and attempt to control the flow of battle makes it an entertaining and useful tool, but its availability is limited and not something you can rely on entirely until you get to meaningfully upgrade it much later in the game.Despite having strong RPG foundations, the combat in The Outer Worlds is very much focussed on first-person action, incorporating things like parries, blocks, and dodges on top of an array of melee weapons and firearms. There's a hectic and fast-paced fluidity to combat that feels very good, however. That's aided by some enthusiastic sound design, which does most of the heavy lifting in giving all weapons some satisfying feedback. A range of ""Science weapons"" bring some creative diversity in your arsenal, and features guns that have unique, entertaining properties like shrinking enemies or turning them against each other.The only problem with combat is that on the game's recommended Regular difficulty, it eventually turns into a cakewalk. This is satisfying in a way, of course--all the points I pumped into maxing out my handgun skills, thus becoming best gunslinger in the galaxy, did actually make me feel utterly invincible. But, it also meant I didn't feel pushed to explore the game's slew of combat-adjacent mechanics nearly as deeply as I would have hoped. Things like elemental damage, equipment modding, companion synergies, and the special effects allowed by consumables (which, by the way, are incredibly difficult to parse in the game's icon-heavy menu), could all be safely ignored. The Outer Worlds has a ""flaws"" system that lets you purposefully shoulder restrictive debuffs in certain situations in exchange for an extra perk point, but it's completely optional and rarely worth the tradeoff. Jumping into the ""Supernova"" difficulty level in a subsequent playthrough changes all that, however--combat danger increases, your ability to save your game becomes restricted, and survival mechanics like hunger and thirst are introduced, making all of the game's mechanical considerations feel far more vital. The game is more challenging and interesting because of it, but its demanding nature definitely makes it more of a second-run option.Toe-to-toe combat is not the only solution to your problems. The Outer Worlds allows for a variety of avenues for alternative and passive solutions--stealth, hacking, and speech-related options are available throughout the game, provided you pass the skill checks. It's nigh impossible to complete the game without getting into at least some combat, unfortunately, but to the game's credit, virtually every quest in the game, big or small, features branching options in terms of their paths to success and how you deal with the big, final choices you have to make to resolve disputes, which are often deliciously grey. It's at the level where you'll always be considering the additional ways you could have achieved something, whether that be taking a different route, finding more information out in the world, or killing the quest giver and everyone else in the town. When you hit the end, the game runs through a whole slew of epilogues that describe how you resolved the game's numerous major variables and what became of them, and being shown all your exploits after some 30 hours makes the whole journey and your unique path through it really feel quite meaningful. It's difficult to know the full extent of just how many directions something can go, and the end result of many quests can likely only ever differ in a small handful of ways, but this perception of freedom and possibilities on your first run is inspiring.I finished The Outer Worlds wanting more, eager to jump back into the world to see extra things. It's not a short game, but it's one packed with such a steady stream of wonderful characters to meet, interesting places to explore, and meaningful, multi-layered quests to solve, that it didn't feel like there was any room to get tired of it. I wanted to rewind the clock and do everything in a completely different way. The Outer Worlds is consistently compelling throughout, and it's a superb example of how to promote traditional RPG sensibilities in a sharp, modern experience. Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"
The Outer Worlds,Cass Marshall,Polygon,https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/10/22/20913097/outer-worlds-review-pc-ps4-xbox-one-obsidian,"Filed under:Obsidian launches its own IP, and the results are spectacularI knew I’d love The Outer Worlds as soon as I stumbled into a cave and met a bleeding, dying gentleman. I offered to help, but he hesitated. Was I using Spacer’s Choice health care products? His contract clearly states that he can’t use a competing product. This was my first real introduction to the weird, corporate dystopia of the Halcyon system, where giant, sprawling conglomerates have the final word on just about everything, and everyone is simply trying to get by. But maybe I can help with this whole mess, if I decide to try. The game begins with Phineas Welles — a guy who’s a little like a nicer Rick, sans Morty — waking me from cryosleep aboard the colonist vessel the Hope. The Hope was lost in space, I’ve been frozen for 70 years, and the entire system went straight to hell while I was on ice. Polygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences. When we award the Polygon Recommends badge, it’s because we believe the recipient is uniquely thought-provoking, entertaining, inventive, or fun — and worth fitting into your schedule. If you want curated lists of our favorite media, check out What to Play and What to Watch.So I’m emerging into a space-capitalist nightmare, and Welles is asking me for help. I’ve just got to murder some robots and raiders, meet the locals down on some of the nearby planets, and try to figure out whether I’m down with Welles’ vision of eating the rich.And I gotta admit, I’m a little hungry. Obsidian Entertainment is behind some of the best role-playing games ever, including Fallout: New Vegas, Alpha Protocol, and Knights of the Old Republic 2. The best moments from the studio’s games come from making imperfect choices in complicated worlds. I don’t remember much about individual areas or weapons from Obsidian titles; I think about characters. That’s the attitude I have when I jump into The Outer Worlds. I grab a weapon, begin to explore the galaxy in the game’s first-person view, fight enemies when necessary, and spend a lot of time talking to people.The game unfolds in an extremely “old lady who swallowed a fly” fashion. I need a ship to get where I’m going, so I should go over there to hire one. Oh no — the guy who owned the ship is dead, and the thing is broken anyways. Guess I need a power supply. Well, the person with the power supplies needs help with a little problem ... you get the idea.Before I know it, I have a full quest log and I’m trekking out with some companions to murder raiders, find lost citizens, and check out a power plant. This is a society run by corporations, like the aforementioned Spacer’s Choice, and almost everyone I talk to is an employee or cog of some kind in that ecosystem.It’s hard to kill, or even fight, a corporation; if you destroy a CEO, another will be appointed. All of this leads to a large-scale confrontation: Welles wants to tear down the Board that runs the colonized Halcyon system and unfreeze all my fellow Hope colonists so he can reform society.The Hope held the best and the brightest minds before it became lost, but more importantly, we haven’t been conditioned to love these corporations in the same manner as those who were born and grew up in the Halcyon system. We believe we can find a better way, because we originally lived in a time where business didn’t always have its boot on our necks ... or at least, the boot wasn’t pressing down quite so firmly. It’s one of the more interesting subplots in the game: I’m willing to fight for the future because we know a better future is possible. Most of the other people around me don’t even know what they’ve given up, including most of my own companions.As in many classic RPGs, each big idea or goal in The Outer Worlds rapidly devolves into a series of quests where I need to either collect or kill things, or find a clever way to avoid doing either.And everything comes down to choices. Am I for the “greater good,” or sticking it to corporations at all costs? Am I a mercenary, a freedom fighter, a burnout, or a sociopath? Happily, the game seems to be ready for whatever I decide I’d like to do. I’m able to betray Phineas right away if I so choose, for instance, by turning him in to the authorities. There are very few rails on this ride.Those very important choices begin when I’m creating my character. I take great care to sculpt a face (that I ultimately don’t see very much), decide my origin (I chose to be a former Earth cashier, so I have some charisma up my sleeve), and then spend some skill points.The Outer Worlds lets me allocate points to a variety of skills in combat, social situations, technology, and even leadership in battle. I’ve put a lot of points into the Sneak skill category in my latest build, for instance. Once the category has been leveled up enough, I can choose to prioritize subskills of Sneak, like Hacking or Lockpicking. I can also select perks that make my life a little easier, like adding extra health or the ability to carry more, or heavier, items. This isn’t about min-maxing as much as it’s about the options I would like to have when solving problems.In one settlement, I’m able to use my medical checks to figure out an important piece of backstory. The plague that I’m trying to fight isn’t anything beyond mortal comprehension; it’s just the flu! Then, I can use my knowledge of how the flu works to lean on the town’s boss for more info about why people aren’t healing from the plague. Turns out, he’s sending them to work even harder to cleanse their imperfections through capitalism! Needless to say, this new perspective changed how I dealt with this guy, and I wasn’t very nice about it. But my medical background took me to an interesting place before my other stats took over when I was ready to enact some of the ol’ ultraviolence.Engineering, persuasion, intimidation, and even lying ... all of these strategies and character builds open up new options and give me opportunities to avoid fighting, if I want to be a more creative player who doesn’t solve everything with might. This is all extremely great for role-playing. Every time I see a robot, my blood runs cold. Their plasma damage hurts, even though I’m now much stronger and tougher because of our bouts. The Outer Worlds nails the feeling of playing a game being run by a talented, but rather mischievous, dungeon master. The combat itself is perfectly adequate, if you decide you’d rather just fight your way toward your goals. There’s even a VATS-like system called Tactical Time Dilation that’s a side effect of my cryosleep. I can slow time at any moment to aim shots, dodge enemies, and reposition myself to have a stronger advantage in combat. The Outer Worlds was never going to be an action game, but the shooting and fighting is above average for a game that’s trying to offer a little bit of everything.As I go about the game and things go wrong, I might get the opportunity to accept a flaw as part of my build. For instance, my character isn’t having a great time fighting robots. The game gives me the option to take on the flaw of Robophobia, and offers me a perk point as compensation. I lean into this, turning the perk into extra carrying weight. I’m stronger overall, but robots remain my bane, and I have a grudge against them.It’s not like relying on brutality means you won’t get to role-play! During another run, I meet an important character during a mission and shoot him in the face, which takes much less time than talking to him about his problems. This triggers an encounter with his guards (they’re pretty upset for some reason, so I have to murder them too), and then I’m able to loot his office and walk away much richer. But one of my companions is now very upset about all the killing and almost leaves the party, until I convince her I did it all for her honor. That doesn’t cheer her up, but she seems worried about “letting me loose” on the world unattended, so she sticks around.See? All the killing was, in fact, very wise. The Outer Worlds is functional and stable for an Obsidian release — the studio’s games have historically been a little shaky at launch — but it’s the writing that elevates the experience. Every NPC has a distinct personality, and it’s easy to remember them all after I’ve moved on from their zones, even the one-dimensional joke characters. I feel bad when a companion or important character gets mad at me, because they’re written so well that they feel like, well, people.

  I collect six companions throughout the game, and they’re seeded throughout the main story. They each have unique perks, skills, and abilities: Parvati’s an engineer, Ellie’s a doctor, and so on. I can bring two of them at a time on missions to give me more options to solve problems or just to give me a hand during combat, and the whole party will often banter among themselves, learning more about each other and sharing their own points of view with me.  They’re a bunch of hot messes, honestly, and they have their own lives going on, ranging from being attracted to different NPCs we meet to wanting to hunt down the hidden truth of their religion. I’m heartbroken that I can’t romance them, because Vicar Max is one of the best RPG companions I’ve ever met, and he’s an absolute daddy of a priest.Each zone I explore helps to build up the overall world as well. Edgewater is a town where workers have to rent their own grave sites, newborn babies are corporate assets, and everyone’s ready to report each other to the ruling Board for crimes like “being sick” or “not loving the Board.”At one point, I spent a good 10 minutes exploring the graveyard. The best workers — their grave sites are marked with their lifetime earnings — have sealed steel coffins. Those in the next tier have metal grates over their graves, ensuring that animals can’t dig up their remains. The third tier just gets headstones. Anyone who can’t pay is thrown into a ditch.Obsidian does not pull any punches with The Outer Worlds: Capitalism is an ever-present, inescapable force that is rotting the Halcyon system. The injustice of it all makes my blood boil, but my companions are there to anchor me, or at least provide more context and nuance. Parvati, a timid engineer, was raised in this society, and she reminds me that the individual workers don’t know any alternatives to how they currently live their lives. At one point, I ignore her and do something drastic to “free” a settlement from a corporation’s control. My reward? A man spits in my face. He never asked to be liberated, and from his point of view, I’ve ruined the only life he has ever known.Obsidian has pulled off the delicate task of creating an RPG that feels big while still keeping control of the overall scope of the game itself. There is a galaxy map, but this isn’t No Man’s Sky, with the freedom to completely explore every sprawling world if I choose to. Each planet consists of relatively small zones, so I’m able to focus on my current quest without becoming overwhelmed. These areas are always small enough that I never lose track of the story or my immediate goals, but complex enough that new seeds are constantly being planted for the next area and quest. The Outer Worlds is expansive when it needs to be, but never falls into the trap of believing that bigger is always better. Each area is like a dense little croissant. The environments are bustling with people who feel like they’re a part of a cohesive society. For a capitalist dystopia where people work themselves into their rent-controlled graves, it’s not too bad to explore. And it’s frequently hilarious, if you don’t mind some incredibly dark humor. At one point, I found a gentleman wearing a giant, terrifying moon mask. No matter what I asked him, he just cheerfully redirected the conversation to the amazing wares of Spacer’s Choice. Can he eat in there? Isn’t it hot? Is that a rat I saw in the mask? He kept a poker face until I asked him if I could try it on. Then, his facade broke, and he pleaded with me to move on and never darken his door with such a suggestion again. It’s touches like this that make hanging out in a dystopia fun, and I can’t wait to go back. The Outer Worlds will be released Oct. 25 on PlayStation 4, Windows PC, and Xbox One.

The Outer Worlds,Gita Jackson,Kotaku,https://kotaku.com/the-outer-worlds-will-rattle-your-idea-of-a-perfect-pla-1839238442,"The very first quest in The Outer Worlds, Obsidian’s highly anticipated first-person RPG out October 25, asked me to make what felt like an impossible choice. On one side was a community of outsiders frustrated by corporate control. Their outpost was something like a worker’s paradise—they were well fed and mostly happy, surviving by relying on each other. I admired their leader, Adelaide, for the passion that she had for her people. On the other side was the corporate-owned town they left, led by Reed Tobson, an idiot that didn’t seem to realize that asking his workers to only eat canned fish (for protein!) led to the population being ravaged by plagues. Despite how much I hated Tobson, he was right that the people working for him suffered because of the workers that had abandoned the town to form their own community.I still don’t know if I did the right thing.The choice I would make would destroy one of these two communities permanently. I managed to find an in-between option, which disbanded the outpost of deserters but also allowed for deep reforms in the town. I was satisfied with this for a short while, but when I got back to my ship, I saw that I’d received a bit of memorabilia from my adventure: a town sign. As I sidled up to examine it, its description told me that I had taught the deserters something important about their dream of a life without corporations: to never dream.The universe that The Outer Worlds takes place in is bleak. Halcyon is a corporate-owned colony consisting of two planets of workers, a mining outpost on an asteroid, a ship called the Groundbreaker that acts as a waystation for groups of workers going to and fro, and a prison planet. Things are in dire straits, as the workers suffer low wages and long hours while the wealthy live in a gilded city, unconcerned with their plight. Several questions drive the game: How do you create the ideal society? And who is at fault for bringing this one to its knees? What adequate punishment exists for those responsible, if there is one at all? The Outer Worlds acts as a mirror this way; you answer these questions via the myriad choices you can make in the game, your moral standing met with visible consequences. You can also avoid all these questions in favor of just shooting everyone you see and taking everything in sight, though as time goes on, you will see how your selfishness affects the people around you.You play a variable that the corporations hadn’t accounted for in their quest for total economic and social control. The scientist (and outlaw) Phineas Welles has unfrozen you from 70 years of cryogenic sleep. You were a passenger on the colony ship The Hope, which houses some of the greatest scientists, artists, and philosophers Earth had to offer but never made it to its destination after being knocked out of its planned route. With their help, Welles thinks that Halcyon can recover, but he needs you to find the chemicals he needs to wake up the rest of the colonists, who have been frozen for so long that they would otherwise experience what Welles calls “explosive cell death” upon being thawed. Your perspective as someone outside of the colony is one that will eventually shape its future.For players concerned about Obsidian’s past issues with buggy releases, you can breathe a sigh of relief. The game isn’t quite bug free—my game had a hard time whenever I visited the abandoned, monster infested town of Cascadia, with texture pop-in and longer loading times, and for some reason it believed that one of my companions was dead, making it impossible to finish their personal quest (and snagging me a deadpan explanation that they didn’t survive at the end of the game). Neither of these issues were exactly game-breaking for me, and my playthrough didn’t suffer for them. This is the Obsidian game that people have been begging for: one with polish.""What happens to a dream deferred?""Class struggle simulatorExtremely thoughtful writing paired with gunplay that's just as sharp.Because the game sets the bar high, the places where the writing doesn't go far enough are glaring.ObsidianPlayStation 4 (played), Xbox One, PC, Switch (eventually)October 25, 2019Around 40 hoursBeing frozen for 70 years has some advantages: You gain “tactical time dilation,” which allows you to slow down time for combat. By slowing down time, you can target specific body parts that will temporarily give your enemies debuffs. Shooting an enemy in the eyes will blind them, making their shots less accurate. It’ll also allow you to reposition yourself, to peek out of cover with just enough time to take down an enemy and run to waist-high wall.The weapons themselves are fun enough to use that even though I tried to talk myself out of violence as much as I could, I never dreaded violence when it occurred. You can find and buy different modifications for your weapons and armor that change how they work, making almost every weapon and armor set work for every playstyle. If you like the hunting rifles but need something that takes out the automechanicals (robots that often have guns), you can add a mod that changes their damage type to shock rather than physical. If you like a certain set of heavy armor but need to sneak by a couple enemies, you can modify that set of armor so that the sounds of your footsteps are quieter.The Outer Worlds serves the player’s needs mechanically at every turn. As you level up, you can unlock perks for even more abilities, like the capacity to carry more items, recharge your tactical time dilation faster, or get a little health with each kill. You can also take on flaws, which will allow you to unlock another perk while giving a permanent debuff to your character. Flaws unlock based on your own weaknesses as a player. If you get sprayed by acid too many times, you can take on a flaw that makes acid that much harsher. I ended up not taking on any flaws, wanting not to continue to suffer for the ways I am deficient as a player, though I can see how this system will drive other players to change up their strategies in order to grab that one perk they were hoping for.These gun fights are fun and sometimes satisfyingly tricky, but it’s hard to get around the elephant in the room when it comes to Obsidian games. Yes, The Outer Worlds mechanically resembles the Fallout series. It was made by the same team that worked on the first two Fallout games as well as Fallout: New Vegas. It’s built on the skeleton of Dungeons and Dragons, with the player assigning points in perception and intelligence in character creation and as you level up. You will have to pass checks on those stats to unlock dialogue options that allow you to finish quests in different ways. This is not dissimilar to what Fallout has become under the ownership of Bethesda, though I will say that I have not felt as motivated to finish Fallout 3 or 4 as I felt to finish The Outer Worlds. The writing is centered, focused on getting the player to confront its class struggle, the universe built with that goal in mind. As a bonus, it’s also quite funny. Early on in the game, I laughed as a corporate guard told me that they were busy dealing with marauders, and worse: parking violators.You and your band of companions will eventually uncover some dark truths about Halcyon. From there, you can reshape it to fit whatever your vision of humanity’s potential is. For some, this will be a reflection of what their politics already are. As a socialist, I knew that whatever I ended up doing would be in the service of a colony that put the rights of workers first. Others who are more sympathetic to corporatism and capitalism will also have paths to enact their visions. If you see fit, you can even side against the scientist who unfroze you, Welles. The Outer Worlds will challenge you to make hard choices in your quest to find a better way of life, offering viewpoints that run directly counter to your own in a way that always felt fair and compelling. By the end of the game, I felt like I understood my own politics better.The key to making this feel naturalistic is by challenging the player to really commit to their ideals. When I first encountered the Iconoclasts, a faction of sorta socialists that are dedicated to their cause with a cult-like fervor, their community starved under a leader who spent far more time on empty rhetoric than on praxis. (In a turn that made me laugh, he’s also a former journalist.) It’s safe to say that the leader of the Iconoclasts is a pretty bad person, but on the other hand, under the control of the corporations, workers don’t have bathroom breaks or weekends. If you play your cards right, you’re probably going to find a way to stay true to yourself without leaving people in power that aren’t serving their communities. But in order to get that far, you’ll have to actively care, and the game provides enough deep character writing to give you avenues to care about what happens to the people of Halcyon.You companions act as guideposts to the many different walks of life that make up Halcyon. Their personal quest lines reveal as much about these characters as the world itself. Parvati is so used to not belonging that when she meets someone that she’s interested in romantically, she doesn’t know how to handle it. Her quest is both an examination of what it is like to be a square peg unable to fit in a round hole as much as it is a touching queer love story. Vicar Max, like other followers of his faith, is looking for peace in some kind of grand design, to make an uncertain world make sense. He is also, as the kids would say, daddy. One of my favorites, Felix, is an orphan who is fleeing Groundbreaker after starting a fight with his foreman over sports. He isn’t well-read, but his convictions are strong—he doesn’t need to study theory to know that workers are being exploited. Your companions will have strong reactions to the main story quests and the decisions you make in them. In fact, it was Parvati’s reactions in that first quest that led me to the choices I ended up making.No matter your politics, you’re not going to finish The Outer Worlds without addressing issues of labor head-on. I’m a union rep for Kotaku, and at times playing this game reminded me of the things we talk about in our meetings: How do we meet the needs of the workers, how do we placate the bosses? As someone not contracted by a corporation, you’re referred to as a “freelancer” by quest givers, which amused me. One quest even had me negotiating between striking workers and their boss. Labor is at the center of everything in Halcyon. The issues that are destroying the colony are directly related to the division of wealth between bosses and workers. Halcyon feels full and complete—at the edges of your understanding of its history lies the implication that nearly a century of life has unfolded in this colony.As my time in Halcyon went on, I ended up parsing what the game was asking me to think about through the Langston Hughes poem “Harlem.” What happens to a dream deferred, in space? Throughout the game you will see the result of dreams that have festered, dried up, crusted over. Once I got that idea in my head, it was hard not to notice the limitations of such a laser-focused pursuit to interrogate class struggle.Halcyon being called a colony certainly made me bristle at times, though conveniently, there are no sentient races that the colonizers have displaced. In The Outer Worlds, all social problems are filtered through class. Sexism and racism don’t meaningfully exist even though race does; many of the people you meet across classes are black and brown. Race and gender go essentially unacknowledged from the game’s core narrative to its tongue-in-cheek riffs on PR buzzwords, which was frustrating in a game so deeply embroiled in power dynamics. In our world, class and race are inexorably tied, and a world in which questions of class are more eternal than questions of race strikes me as dishonest. I trust in Obsidian to broach those issues with the same grace as they do issues of class, so I wish they had gone there.The Outer Worlds is so impactful that it made me question and ultimately settle more thoughtfully into my beliefs. My game ended with what felt like a utopian, worker-led vision for Halcyon, and the game gives you the room to enact whatever your personal vision may be. It pushed me without feeling preachy and gave me some fun shootouts between the politicking. In the end, The Outer Worlds aligns itself with Hughes. The dream of paradise that Halcyon has deferred exploded. How you pick up those pieces is up to you, for better or worse."
The Outer Worlds,Mike Williams,USgamer,https://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-outer-worlds-review,"
In an alternative timeline, Bethesda made Fallout 5 instead of 76 and cleaned up its bugs.That imaginary timeline isn't far from the Hellscape we inhabit in 2019, except it's Bethesda buddies Obsidian that have taken the Fallout formula, cleaned up the sloppy implementation and refined an adventure RPG that has all the early signs of evolving into its own series. The Outer Worlds may reach across planets, but it's smaller in scale that Fallout 4 and New Vegas. It's a focused game with a joyously conceived world, society and politics, making exploration and conversation with the locals flow like swirling currents. You're unlikely to get lost or lose track of your objectives when such snappy dialogue tumbles out of mouths. There's always a zinging one-liner to give you a sign-posted push in the right direction. Who doesn't want to flirt with a pharmacist for free drugs? Why would you say no to a mission that asks you to retrieve dinosaur robot porn?

Although you're exploring multiple planets and space stations, it's as familiar as the Wasteland or Commonwealth. The Outer Worlds is draped in sci-fi Americana, with a little bit of the Wild West thrown in for good measure. It has its own version of VATS where you slow down time to pinpoint better shots and cause more damage. It has a wealth of perks to choose from, sassy companions who need your help, and romantic dilemmas to get involved with. You will hack, loot, upgrade at benches and sneak past guards who really should be able to spot a party of three knee-crouching like something out of a bad panto. There's even a cute mascot or two to rival Vault Boy. An early part of the main questline has you wrestle with a big moral decision like you're back in Nuketown playing with The Power of the Atom. Todd Howard must be doing his nut in.Still, while it borrows heavily from Bethesda to the point of someone from the legal department drafting a stern letter, it's also confident in its own strengths. The clear highlight of The Outer Worlds is its dialogue and characters. The locals are quick witted, or drunk and stupid, horny, aggressive, depressed, pissed off, cynical, caustic, hyped up, ignorant, condescending and angry. They're a hoot, and it feels like every branch of conversation spins off into its own drama, tale of revenge, loss or friendship. It's refreshing and noticeable that the world isn't populated by boring white men asking you to do gruff military stuff. One of the first romance options you come across isn't about your personal love interests, but trying to facilitate a get together between two characters admiring each other from afar. It's genuinely sweet, even for a cynical, old, black-hearted bastard like myself. There's a lot more fun to be had spending quality time with the locals than fighting the mercenaries and monsters that lurk outside of town.  
 
""For those that were disappointed with Fallout 76 going online multiplayer, this is the single-player RPG you've been looking for""That's not to say combat is bad, but it is flavourless. The Outer Worlds is a better RPG and adventure game than a shooter, so it's a shame that it litters unexplored areas with so many enemies. It can feel like a slog churning through them to get to the next interesting populace. Enemy AI tends to default between charging like a bloke on a Saturday after nine pints, or just floating in the distance spitting venom and bullets at you. Your best approach is either send in your companions to do the dirty work, unload everything you have, or run away. There's also an abundance of cash and ammo on the default settings, which may be an admission that you'll want to blast through combat to get to the better bits. If violence and risk is your thing, tougher difficulties will make your companions mortal. But again, I'd rather try a second playthrough with a different attitude and stats than simply making combat harder.And while it borrows from the best, it doesn't stretch itself or risk innovation. The Outer Worlds never goes too deep in any one direction. Sure, you can upgrade and tinker with your stats, but you'll never get lost in the system or fall down a rabbit hole to really refine your character build. There's a neat little flaw system in play that adapts to your style; if you get your ass kicked by a lot of robots, for example, you can choose to accept a phobia and weakened stats in exchange for an extra perk. It's a shame then that perks are so functional. They may help you carry more, or do more damage, but there's little of the inventiveness of Fallout's vampire Hematophage perk, or the Mysterious Stranger. That feels like a missed opportunity in a game brimming with wit, but maybe it's something that would develop for a sequel. It also commits a few basic RPG sins we thought were on their way to the bin in 2019, such as forcing you to choose stats before you've barely played the game. But when it's hitting you with good gags at character creation with all the perky confidence of a Barden Bella on enrollment day, it's a niggle you can forgive quite easily.  
 
It doesn't feel right to praise a game for not having ugly or game-breaking bugs, but it's something we associate with this genre of sprawling single-player RPG. In The Outer Worlds' case then, Bethesda should really take note. Aside from some basic pop-up entering larger areas, I've come across no evidence of weird graphical glitches, busted questlines, disappearing items, weird animations or any of the other sloppiness we've become used to in recent Fallout games. Congratulations on not being broken, The Outer Worlds. That said, this is a much less physical world than Bethesda’s, which are usually littered with props that the game has to remember the location of. Most of The Outer Worlds’ items exist in menus.  I usually play these games with a build that errs on the side of violence when it comes down to it. I'm happy to play with a nasty attitude and blunder through killing and insulting people if I think there's more in it for me. But The Outer Worlds had me considering my violent acts, pulling me back from the brink on a number of occasions when I thought I'd already made my mind up how to deal with a situation. That's a testament to the great writing and characterisation, and it's this that The Outer Worlds should be celebrated for above all else.The Outer Worlds serves a need and fills a gap very neatly at the end of this console generation. The charm of The Outer Worlds lends itself to water-cooler tales and other moments to share, and certainly more than one playthrough adopting alternative styles. It's safe, but very welcoming. I can even see it developing into sequels if Microsoft chooses to support it and the fans embrace it, which I have no doubt will happen - some games are just made to cosplay. For those that were disappointed with Fallout 76 going online multiplayer, this is the single-player RPG you've been looking for. If you're hankering for somewhere you can while away the hours talking shit, chuckling and prodding at the locals, you won't be disappointed. Version tested: PS4.

THE OUTER WORLDS Switch version is now finally available, launching eight months after the PC, PS4, and Xbox One editions of the game. Virtuos is the developer behind the port, tasked with squashing down the Obsidian Entertainment creation to play nicely with the less powerful Nintendo Switch. We were blown away with The Outer Worlds when we played it on PS4 Pro, so how does it hold up on Nintendo’s hybrid home-portable console? Here’s our verdict.Coming in at a relatively impressive 13.7 GB in size, The Outer Worlds fits onto a game cartridge with plenty of room to spare. While other titles have suffered a loss in audio fidelity due to over-compression to get the game to fit, The Outer Worlds Switch version sounds solid to me. This is the full experience, too, so there was no need to cut content to save space.The Switch edition features motion controls, using the console’s gyroscope. Players can opt to aim by rotating a detached Joy-Con. I didn’t find this to be useful at all, but hey, it’s an option and it might work well for others.Of course, the biggest advantage of playing The Outer Worlds on Switch is the portability factor. You can now enjoy a fantastic Obsidian RPG on a handheld, a feat that’s still hard to believe despite my many hours with the game.Of course, non-Lite players can still dock their system and play on the big screen. Though, I’d personally advise against doing that as it turns the already heavily compromised visuals into an even bigger mess. This gets worse the bigger the external display is.This is where things get ugly, unfortunately. While it should be obvious that a game like The Outer Worlds is going to suffer compromises when moving to less powerful hardware, I was still surprised by the downgraded visuals. Something had to give in order to keep performance at an acceptable level, and it quickly becomes obvious that the “something” was a crisp resolution.As you’ll see in the majority of screenshots that I’ve captured while playing, The Outer Worlds can get very, very blurry. While the output resolution is 720p portable and 1080p docked, it’s clear that upscaling from a lower resolution is often used to keep the experience as close to 30 FPS as possible.It’s a shame to see what is such a fantastic-looking game on PC, PS4, and Xbox One, crushed down to look like this. There are no graphics options to fiddle around with, either, which are what ultimately helped save The Witcher 3 on Switch from looking like a puddle of Vaseline.Overall stability of the frame-rate is mostly fine. However, in larger gunfights or when moving more quickly through the world, you can sometimes suffer the occasional hiccup. Both docked and portable play had these rare stutters, but they were infrequent enough to only be minor annoyances.I’m happy that frame-rate has been given the priority, especially for a game with a first-person perspective and gameplay that requires reasonably speedy aim, but it comes at a much greater cost than I was expecting.I should also mention load times, which are a little long. Saving the game is very quick, however, which is important for a title like this where players may want to rechoose dialogue options or approach a fight differently. The game supports multiple save files, so you can go wild.If you can get past the greasy look of the game, you’ll still find The Outer Worlds‘ gameplay underneath. The awesome class and weapon customization will still keep you busy as you become more powerful and try out new tools. Tough decisions still need to be made, and you’ll see them impact the world in positive and negative ways. You’ll also still be able to appreciate the variety in scenery across different planets.Characters are well-acted and vibrant, with their own little quirks giving them that extra bit of personality. This often makes it tricky to choose which faction to side with, especially if you’re used to trying to keep everyone happy in other games. There are multiple ways to play out the adventure, which invites a replay or two.Some of the characters you meet will offer to join you as a companion. Companions in other RPGs can often hold you back or require you to babysit them, but in The Outer Worlds they are incredibly useful. Helping to bolster the player’s statistics is one advantage, but companions also have their own abilities that can save the day against a big mob of enemies or a particularly tough boss.Again, there is still a lot to enjoy here. Obsidian made a damn good game, creating a Fallout-style RPG with its own unique strengths, which is now playable on the go.While the game’s blurry presentation has me recommending any other version of The Outer Worlds over this Switch edition, if you have to play on the Nintendo handheld, then there are a few ways you can handle the compromised experience.The aim assist and easy difficulty option both help to make challenging combat easier to handle and less stressful. While controls are decently responsive, intense combat can still be tricky. Keep the aim assist on and consider playing on easy to help balance out any accuracy fails.I chose to avoid sniper builds and focus on melee, in addition to leadership. This meant that I didn’t have to worry about pinpoint accuracy and I was able to rely on my companions’ fast ability cooldowns to make fights easier. Investing points into buffing the Tactical Time Dilation is also wise, as it allows you to constantly be slowing down time to land shots.Obviously it’s not great that I felt the need to go down a specific customization path just to handle the combat, but fighting is only one aspect of The Outer Worlds. There is still a lot of enjoyable gameplay to be had with interacting with characters and exploring the wild landscapes.It’s unfortunate that The Witcher 3 on Switch set the bar so high for handheld ports. While it also had its compromises, it still managed to retain the charm of one of the best games of all time, with the options to disable Motion Blur and Blur, as well as to increase Sharpening, coming in clutch to save it.The Outer Worlds on Switch is too heavily compromised in the visuals department for me to recommend it above any other version of the game. However, for owners of the Nintendo Switch and no other supported system, then there is still plenty to love here, provided you can stomach the full price at launch.This was of the greatest games of 2019 and is still worthy of playing, but you’ll need to prepare yourself for the blur. It’s still The Outer Worlds, provided you squint a little!The Outer Worlds was reviewed on an original Nintendo Switch with code provided by the publisher. The game is also available on PC, PS4, and Xbox One.7Mack is slowly grinding his way to Level 100. With each article you read, he gets 1 XP! // 23,597 XP UNTIL NEXT LEVEL //Share article"

Paul Tamburro 
It’s impossible to discuss The Outer Worlds without mentioning Fallout. It touches every cornerstone of a Fallout game, from the camera zooming in on an NPC’s face when you strike up a conversation with them, through to enemies crumpling up in an awkward pile of physics when you kill them with a critical shot. Developer Obsidian isn’t exactly shy of its influence. However, branding The Outer Worlds as “Fallout, but in space” would be doing a disservice to what the studio has achieved here; if The Outer Worlds were a Fallout game, it’d arguably be the best Fallout game ever.The comparisons between The Outer Worlds and Bethesda’s post-apocalyptic series are immediate and obvious. It’s a first-person, open-world action RPG set in a struggling star system filled with morally dubious characters who can be attacked, bartered with, and befriended. Players are aided in combat by Tactical Time Dilation, which allows them to slow time in order to land critical shots with greater ease. Quests can have multiple outcomes and will force you to make tough decisions, such as whether to divert power to an established community struggling with plague and famine, or divert it to a thriving band of deserters. It shares more in common with New Vegas than Fallout 3 or 4, which is understandable considering Obsidian developed the 2010 spin-off. Its utilization of an overarching faction reputation system also contributes to it feeling more like a New Vegas spiritual successor than a sci-fi Fallout 5.But while Bethesda may have fallen into the deep end after fundamentally misunderstanding its audience with Fallout 76, The Outer Worlds takes what that audience loves and expands on it. The end result is a sprawling adventure that feels like it could have been published by Bethesda, while also outright removing many of the flaws and mistakes of its source of inspiration. It’s well-polished, ambitious, and boasts a gripping central story that continues to ramp up the stakes until its satisfying conclusion.The Outer Worlds places you in the player-created shoes of a survivor of the Hope, a colony ship that seemingly disappeared without a trace after being sent to help colonize the Halcyon star system. You’re rescued by the eccentric Phineas Wells, a rogue scientist on the run from the sinister Board, the entity which controls all of Halcyon. Waking up from a deep cryosleep, you must go in search of more information about the Board, the Hope, and the future of the Halcyon system.You navigate the system in your ship, the charmingly titled ‘The Unreliable,’ previously owned by the AWOL Captain Hawthorne. The Captain is AWOL because your escape pod crashed on top of him and killed him in The Outer Worlds‘ opening scenes, but you now have the added bonus of assuming his identity whenever anyone asks you for ID. Or you can play it straight and give them the truth. Or you can attack them and make them wish they never asked you in the first place. The star system is your oyster in The Outer Worlds, and there are multiple ways to solve each problem it presents.There’s no all-encompassing karma system, with your choices instead affecting your reputation with each faction you encounter. Keep working in favor of one faction and they’ll grow to revere you, but if it’s to the detriment of another faction they’ll eventually learn to despise you and attack you on sight. Across both its main and side quests, you’ll be faced with numerous tough moral decisions to make, and rarely does the decision feel clear-cut good or evil. In my second playthrough, I attempted to play as selfishly as possible, but the dialogue is so engrossing and the characters so sympathetic and well-acted that I found it genuinely difficult to detach myself from its story to do so.In certain quests, you’ll find yourself faced with a decision that will have devastating ramifications on one community but greatly benefit the other. However, even in those quests, there are smaller choices you can make leading up to this decision that might help you reach an amicable conclusion. There’s also the possibility that you’ll play your cards wrong and botch the quest altogether, preventing you from completing it in the process. While there’s no right or wrong way to complete a quest, there are certainly more satisfying outcomes. These are typically achieved with more legwork, whether that be completing the optional quests included in a certain objective, or talking to involved parties who may offer you additional helpful information.Due to Obsidian presenting players with very few instances of good vs. bad, there’s a distinct lack of a primary antagonist. You meet characters that get on your bad side, and you know that the Board isn’t to be trusted, but for much of the game your player-character is without an arch-nemesis. This works when it comes to dealing with the conflicts of the planets you visit, but not when it comes to tackling the overarching threat of the Board.The Board is a mostly silent oppressor, with its stranglehold on Halcyon initially being explained to you in conversation with its dissatisfied colonists. You know that it’s the puppeteer of the system that seems to be asleep at the wheel, with various communities in its regime struggling for survival while its members seemingly thrive. It’s a story about the evils of the sci-fi one-percenters, though given The Outer Worlds‘ penchant for exploring the moral grey areas rather than the black and whites, its message isn’t as simple as “capitalism bad.” Making the “right” decision in the game usually isn’t as simple as outright siding with the dissenters, even though it’s clear from your surroundings that the Board’s methods aren’t working as well as they’d like you to believe.The Outer Worlds is set in an alternate future where President William McKinley wasn’t assassinated, allowing him to serve his full second term and continue his support of big business. This leads to the 23rd century being dominated by megacorporations, who have ventured far beyond Earth and now govern the alien planets they’ve colonized. The exact timeframe of all this space travel and terraforming is muddled; each planet retains the same retrofuturistic aesthetic, coupling space marine armor and science weapons with 1950s-era posters and saloons.While these inconsistencies can certainly be ignored, it doesn’t give The Outer Worlds its own visual identity. Perhaps this was a conscious decision to lure in the Fallout fans, but even transporting another era into space like the ’70s or ’80s would have been preferable. Instead, its ramshackle buildings and the fashion sense of those living in them feels derivative. If ‘I Don’t Want to Set the World on Fire’ started playing on my ship’s speakers, I wouldn’t have second-guessed it.Fortunately, the planets themselves look gorgeous. Their pastel color palette is reminiscent of No Man’s Sky, while their skyboxes are filled with the nearby planets you can see on your ship’s navigation system. Looking up in the sky and being curious about a distant planet, then being able to travel over to it later, makes the game’s series of relatively small open-world environments feel massive. While they aren’t exactly busy outside of their designated communities — don’t expect many random quests to pop up while you’re out exploring — there’s a fast travel system that eradicates all of the unnecessary wandering you’d otherwise have to do. This ensures that hopping between objectives is never laborious, and most exploring you do is out of choice, not necessity.I was also taken aback by how few glitches I encountered during my playthroughs, considering that Obsidian’s last crack at the Fallout whip was the infamously buggy New Vegas. Aside from a smattering of physics-related problems after killing enemies in firefights, not one notable issue in this department crept in during my 40+ hours with the game. While it may be capped at 30 FPS on PS4 Pro, I never experienced any noticeable dips, and everything ran smoothly from beginning to end.Combat isn’t the most interesting aspect of The Outer Worlds on the surface, though remains consistently exciting throughout. By providing its own spin on VATs with Tactical Time Dilation, you’re granted the opportunity to systematically take down enemies in fun and gruesome firefights. TTD allows you to slow down time and aim your shots better, along with displaying information on-screen indicating what each shot will do. If you aim for the eyes, you can disorientate your attacker, or aiming for their weak point might land a critical hit and bring them to their knees. Entering into pseudo-bullet time and slow-mo shooting at a giant mantiqueen’s belly retains the pace of the action, unlike VATs pulling you out into a boring menu, while also allowing you to deal out massive damage while feeling like a hugely overpowered gunslinger.Melee weapons don’t fare as well as ranged weapons, with close-quarters combat being trickier to handle in first-person and many tougher enemies dealing massive damage when up close. However, particularly in the late game, you eventually get access to some monstrously overpowered equipment that’s a blast to use. There are more than a few guns and melee weapons tucked into The Outer Worlds which dramatically turn the tide in your favor, and while it doesn’t threaten Borderlands 3‘s zany arsenal of firearms, they still pack an almighty punch.Despite bringing the ’50s to space, The Outer Worlds left behind its social politics. The companions you can recruit throughout your journey are a diverse group, ranging from Max, the hilariously embittered vicar, through to Nyoka, a drunk big game hunter. Each brings something unique to the table, both in terms of their personality and the special abilities they can perform in battle. They also have their own equipable perks, which can grant you bonuses both in and out of conflict, along with providing you with advice during tough decisions.AI teammates are always a difficult proposition given their propensity to do the opposite of what you want, and The Outer Worlds sometimes skirts this fine line. Without leveling up the specific skill dedicated to healing them, they’re difficult to keep alive, being much more willing to throw themselves in the line of gunfire than you’d like. Fortunately, their aggressiveness and the range in which they do combat can be altered, ensuring that they won’t attack unless explicitly told to do so. After investing points into increasing their respective abilities, I also swiftly found that my little team was able to decimate swathes of enemies at will.It’s all a matter of how much you want to invest in them, but with the option of also being able to leave them behind on the Unreliable, if you’re more of a lone wolf then you needn’t worry about them getting in your way. Still, you’d be missing out on the camaraderie that helps drive The Outer Worlds‘ story of a plucky band of survivors fighting back against the big bad Board. While there are no tangible improvements in your relationships with your companions as you progress (i.e. no romance options), just having them along for the ride adds personality to your quests. Whether they’re having little arguments with each other, or poking their head in to offer their unsolicited thoughts on a shady quest-giver, it makes you feel like Picard beaming down from the Enterprise with a couple of members of Starfleet.Of course, you don’t have to be as Lawful Good as Picard, and it often feels like The Outer Worlds doesn’t want you to be. During conversations, specialized dialog options will routinely present themselves if you have a high enough level in that particular skill. For instance, you may be able to lie about the disturbing fertilization methods used by a community leader, or you could intimidate a guard into stepping aside and allowing you entry into a restricted area. These present unique solutions to challenging problems, though it does feel like it’s far too easy to talk your way out of situations.There is no downside to using one of these specialized dialog options, as they will always be successful if your skill level is high enough. Lying to someone, even if that person is a high-standing community member, won’t affect your faction reputation, and I never came across someone who responded to my intimidation methods by calling my bluff and attacking me. Given how many variables there are in The Outer Worlds’ quests, perhaps the addition of even more deviations from the common path presented would have been too much for Obsidian to implement. However, the lack of repercussions you face can be jarring after you’ve made a particularly cutting remark about someone who really didn’t deserve it.While this element of The Outer Worlds may be over-simplified, I found myself able to overlook it as a result of the impressive complexity of its branching dialog. In terms of the game’s bigger picture, every action has a suitable reaction and the consequences of my decisions were always logical, even if they were often grim. It’s difficult being the middle-man of a bunch of colonized alien planets, and while I attempted to toe the line between citizens and the looming presence of the Board, doing so while also operating in my own self-interest presented various moral quandaries. In different playthroughs I attempted different solutions, and the stark contrast between the outcome of these solutions was impressive.A game with as much player-choice as The Outer Worlds has the potential to leave a slew of loose ends behind when the credits roll, but Obsidian ensures that everything is impacted as it should be in your wake. As a result, your decisions feel crucial and important, with you leaving a real impact on each location you visit — for better and for worse. When citizens say that word has got around about your misadventures, you believe them, and it’s suitably depressing to return to a town that you’ve tarnished only for its desperate citizens to start attacking you as soon as you enter the door.For over 40 hours, The Outer Worlds allowed me to be a space cowboy with all the adventure, intrigue, and danger that came along with it. Planet-hopping throughout Halcyon is one of the best experiences I’ve had in a game in years, introducing me to a cast of sympathetic and interesting characters, throwing me into exciting gunfights, and inundating me with tough decisions to make. This is a must-play for RPG fans, and an absolutely vital game for Fallout fans.The Outer Worlds review code provided by publisher.

The Outer Worlds,Chris Carter,Destructoid,https://www.destructoid.com/review-the-outer-worlds-569391.phtml,"darkFor the uninitiated, when publishers wanted a sure-thing studio to come in and elevate an existing IP, Obsidian was the one developer you called. They rocked The Old Republic for BioWare and continued the Neverwinter Nights series. Look, they made the best modern Fallout game, New Vegas. Our audience even agrees!In the past nine years they’ve mostly stuck to the Baldur’s Gate-esque Pillars of Eternity series (plus Tyranny), a one-off adventure with a South Park RPG, and a joint MMO venture with Allods Team. What I’m saying is: I want more Obsidian in my life.And with The Outer Worlds, a massive first-person RPG in the same vein as New Vegas, I got it.The Outer Worlds (PC, PS4 [reviewed], Switch, Xbox One)
Developer: Obsidian Entertainment
Publisher: Private Division
Released: October 25, 2019 (PC, PS4, XB1) / TBA (Switch)
MSRP: $59.99If you were expecting something irreverent and subversive that didn’t take itself too seriously: congratulations, you’re going to love Outer Worlds. Our journey takes us to Halcyon: a perfect society “guaranteed to maximize your productivity.” I got immediate Sorry to Bother You vibes from the whole professional servitude angle, and one of the first lines of dialogue is “not likely, bootlickers.” Oh hell yeah, this is my kind of game.Naturally, a rebel group sparks conflict at the start of the game’s events, and that’s where you come in. Said rebel leader cherry-picks one of the many hibernating citizens (you), which is how they cleverly justify the character creation process. Said process, mind, is extremely customizable, allowing you to jack up (or down) various parts of your personality, which impacts skills like melee or ranged attacks, tech, stealth, lock-picking, defense, and dialogue-based options.There’s even a (mostly flavor) “aptitude” rating that defines your former career/life. For my first playthrough I was a silver-tongued, crackshot cashier, which is another way of saying I was living my best virtual life. The whole system is rife for replays, which plays into the multiple endings angle. After your avatar is good and ready you’ll jet down to a planet surface to help out (or betray) your benefactors. It’s open-ended like that.It must be said upfront: this is not a fully open world game, and you know what? I’m glad. Zones are broken up into planets or space stations (which you can jet to using your ship), and there isn’t one big map to connect them all. Because of this choice, each zone gets its own chance to breathe a little without the stress involved with pixel-hunting icons (or radio towers) on a map.It helps that my first impression of the initial planet was positive. You can see out into the distant, beautiful horizon, and the segmented approach helps differentiate each area. Due to the isolated nature of the planet-by-planet structure, it’s natural to feel cut off from the universe as a whole; like Outer Worlds is smaller than it really is.Thankfully, Obsidian keeps treks (and load times) to a minimum as it focuses on planet-centric storylines without having to hop across the galaxy for errands. The flow kind of reminds me of the new God of War, moving around to different medium-to-large-sized zones through a hub interface. Your ship, which houses your companions (yes, this is one of my favorite Obsidian things too), is also home to ADA, your wisecracking AI. It’s safe in some respects, keen to not jettison every modern RPG trope.It’s got marauders (evil flesh-eating mercs, classic), lock picking (though thankfully not a minigame this time, just a button prompt), that sort of familiarity. It’s comfortable at times. But it also has the classic Obsidian charm, filled to the brim with clandestine political discussions, plenty of (well-timed and funny) outbursts of cursing, and that rusted vibrancy aesthetic they do so well. Although walking around can sometimes feel lifeless — especially when so many buildings are closed or layouts repeat — that feeling often fades when you see a weird new lifeform or a ship fly by in the sky to remind you that you’re not alone.That humor also pays dividends when you’re doing the actual RPG bits. This is one of those games where you’re often presented with five branching choices, which will spur a lot of save file diversity just to see where it all deviates. You’ll see what I mean when you try to talk down a major confrontation and can’t do it due to a lack of persuasion rating.Just like the Bethesda-era Fallout series it draws upon, The Outer Worlds‘ bread and butter is first-person combat, but with a time-slow ability (that can be tweaked) instead of V.A.T.S. The emphasis on constant motion makes everything feel more action-oriented as a result, which Obsidian doubles down on with a double-tap/click jump dodge (melee is also formidable in Outer Worlds because the time-slow mechanic benefits both ranged and close-quarters styles of play). Of course, there’s always the non-violent/stealth option, and interesting optional “flaws” can pop up after messing up one too many times (like acrophobia if you fall too much).From a UI perspective, it also isn’t a complete mess on consoles in spite of the complexity. The inventory system is clean (with an option to instantly mark items as junk and pawn them off en masse), there’s a respec (build change) tool, and best of all, food buffs you for a limited time — no more pausing the game to spam 25 apples to recover health.You can solve conflicts non-violently through your words, murder everyone, extort them, or chastise them and make them apologize for off-handed comments. You’ll also have the chance to convince unsuspecting NPCs that you’re a space inspector instead of confronting them upfront, then kill them when they’re walking away. This sort of openness extends all the way through to the end, where exhaustive satisfying epilogues are provided for all major characters (at least in my case).The absolute highlight of Outer Worlds though has to be the companion system. It’s no bullshit, shucking any sort of unfun micromanagement or restrictions. Once you meet a companion you can always quest with them anywhere, and they’ll constantly chime in with their opinion on the task at hand or open up new quests/avenues of play. They passively buff your skills and carrying capacity by just existing, and while the AI is decent by default, you can customize their basic strategy through menu options. Companions also sport over-exaggerated skills (which are supers, really) and can be fully kitted out with their own inventory, gear, and perks. Plus you can have two with you at all times!Although I did not encounter any crashes on PS4, there is jank. Sometimes the game says you’re in combat when you clearly aren’t, forcing you to retreat a bit (or even fast travel) to sort of clean the errant glitchy pipes and allow you to interact with a key item. Companion powers are shaky too, and sometimes buggy (teleporting them across the field instantly), but they’re fun to look at and always connect as a result.An open world game also has to have open world bugs, right? During my playthrough on PS4, I encountered some frame-skipping (nothing too major, unless you’re playing on the max difficulty setting, then it can cause problems), and the game-over screen is super sudden, which is annoying when coupled with an infrequent auto-save system. Loading screens, when they do happen, can approach 30 seconds even on a PS4 Pro.Despite some nominal issues that might be easier for some to hand-wave than others, Obsidian has out-Fallouted recent Fallout efforts. The Outer Worlds is more limited from a size standpoint compared to a lot of other open world adventures, but it makes up for it in charm and a succinct vision without much bloat.[This review is based on a retail copy of the game provided by the publisher.]SuperbA hallmark of excellence. There may be flaws, but they are negligible and won't cause massive damage.

Login NowThe Outer Worlds provides a solid set of tools and a vibrant world full of interesting characters to carve your own path. Our review of Obsidian Entertainment's Game of the Year contender.Nothing makes me buy into a game more than knowing my decisions have an impact on the outcome. The more I’m asked to invest, the more I expect to receive in return. Experiences like this often leave me thinking about them long after I’m done, and such is the case with The Outer Worlds. From its first moments until its last, players will be asked to make decisions which will alter how the story plays out. Seemingly insignificant moments will come back to bite hours later, and hindsight will force players to second guess their choices and fire up another run. In The Outer Worlds, players find themselves waking from hibernation after the ship they’re traveling on goes dark and is abandoned. Their immediate goal, given by Phineas Welles, the stranger that wakes them from cryo-sleep, is to head to a nearby colony to secure resources and wake the remaining passengers aboard the ship. This kicks off a journey that sees players trying to make sense of a world that, on the surface seems stable, but is struggling against the immense pressure of corporate greed.Once given control things begin in similar fashion to many open-world games. Players create their ideal character both aesthetically and by allotting skill points to shape how they wish to play. The game will run through a tutorial mission that teaches the ins and outs of movement, stealth, dialogue, and both melee and ranged combat. This tutorial mission leads to the Unreliable, a ship that serves as a personal hub throughout the experience. It’s complete with a map to travel to different planets, personal quarters to store items, and a workbench to tinker, modify, repair, or break down gear. Soon enough, though, the training wheels come off and players are given total control to shape the events of almost every moment of The Outer Worlds.Truthfully, it took me a few hours to really get my feet under me in The Outer Worlds. I was engaging in every conversation and exploring all dialogue options. This led to a quest page full of things to do all over the game’s first planet, Terra 2. I even recruited my first companion, but, as someone who’d recently woken from hibernation and been dropped off on a strange world, I was figuring it all out. I wasn’t seeing the complete picture.My first major task was to decide the fate of two opposing groups of people, but I had lots of side quests to deal with along the path. The path, by the way, was littered with enemies like humans, robots, and alien beasts. To my surprise, only once was combat challenging on the default difficulty, and I didn’t initially understand it to appreciate all the moving parts. What I failed to realize in my first hours was the depth combat could have with the right skills and perks. Bump Leadership and companions can unleash devastating special attacks. Add a few points to the Ranged skill and see enemy weak points in Tactical Time Dilation, The Outer Worlds’ version of Fallout’s V.A.T.S. I understood little of this in the first few hours, and this left me feeling like combat was simply there out of necessity.Once I had a feel for combat and how the skill and perk trees worked, things opened up. I started thinking outside the box about how to approach objectives. There is almost always more than one way to tackle a quest in The Outer Worlds. Players can choose to invest heavily in the Persuade skill to talk their way out of a sticky situation, go with a balance of combat and people skills, or shoot their way through any problems that pop up. I regret a lot of my skill-point decisions from my first run, mostly because the game teased me by showing I could have talked my way out of something had I spent my skill points better. Say hello to replay value.The Outer Worlds is not just about shooting and conflict, though. Most of my time was spent exploring, digging into the lore presented through environmental storytelling, and working my way through conversations that would shape the future of the colony. I’m not someone who can leave a building or crate unchecked. I must read all terminals, pick up all gear, and look high and low for alternate paths to complete an objective or find a hidden stash of weapons. The Outer Worlds has an abundance of subtle things to discover.The high of exploration is driven by gorgeous graphics in The Outer Worlds. Realism isn’t the goal, with Obsidian Entertainment opting instead to go with a colorful world full of unique characters and creatures. Whether walking through the abandoned buildings of Terra 2 or exploring the dark corridors of a space station, Halcyon is a world I can’t get enough of. This extends to each of the game’s characters, which are all unique in how they look and are exceptionally portrayed through great writing and acting.The quality of characters in The Outer Worlds is never on better display than with its various companions to meet and travel with. Each has their own story and gameplay benefits when in the player’s company. I had my favorites shortly after meeting them, and generally stuck with those two (yes, you can travel with two at a time) unless there was a gameplay reason for taking someone else, such as their personal quest.In hindsight, The Outer Worlds might have my favorite companions in any game, partly because of how relatable I found them, but also because they offered real value to my decisions. At one point I was settled on a major choice, until my companion offered up an alternate perspective I hadn’t considered. I’m used to NPCs telling me something is bad because they believe it’s bad, but this was more subtle and genuinely convinced me I was making the wrong move when I previously thought it was a no-brainer.If there’s anything that just wasn’t quite up to standard with The Outer Worlds, it was in its menus. The pop-up description for inventory items blocks the rest of the inventory, which made navigation a bit of a chore. The Codex, for some reason, would give me a notification if I repeated an in-game action I’d already been notified of. The quest log would only allow tracking a single quest, even with several to tackle while in the area. This led me to track a quest, check the map, track another, check the map, and repeat this through my entire quest page.For the most part, I was a fan of the game’s workbench where players can tinker, modify, scrap, or repair their weapons and armor. What I wasn’t a fan of was finding a weapon in the world and not being able to compare it to what I had equipped. Carry weight is limited based on skills, perks, mods and companions, so I might pick a weapon up or leave it behind based on stats, but this decision required entering and exiting several menus. I also would have preferred my personal storage on the Unreliable be connected to the workbench for easier modifications to gear. None of these were game breaking and it would only cause me momentary frustration, but it’s something that could have been better polished.It took me a few hours to really get my feet under me in The Outer Worlds. During those early stages, I thought this was a good game most would enjoy, but I wasn’t thinking about it between sessions and questioning decisions. It was an issue of mastery, though, and it would be unrealistic to expect the best a game has to offer in the first 10 percent of its content. As I began to invest more, I found a highly rewarding experience. When I reached the conclusion of my first run, I couldn’t wait to get back in and right some wrongs by approaching things from a different perspective.The Outer Worlds demands players put in the time and effort if they want the best it has to offer. It’s a fine game under any circumstances, but it’s a top-notch RPG with heavy consequences at almost every turn for those that are willing to immerse themselves. The Outer Worlds doesn’t tell you a story, it gives you a world full of interesting characters and asks you to tell your own.This review is based on a PC download code provided by the publisher.

					Who the fuck is PCGamesN? Never heard of them.  But they do have a real website evidently.  Doesn't matter, don't know who he is don't care.  				
					Some Jaboofers.				
					Today I learned: Jaboofer;   term used for over-achievers in some High School Algebra classes  Interesting.  				
					That is not my definition.				
					Definition please!				
					A jaboofer is a jabroni who acts like a douche.				
					I have returned to this comment and laughed at least three times due entirely to you taking the time to verify they are a real website.				
					I love that Shacknews is included in the grouping.				
					Great review!!				
					So glad it's good, getting more hype!				
					Oh shi...there goes $60! Great job to the Obsidian team!				
					Get it on Gamepass for 1 dollar				
					[deleted]				
					So good!				
					Nice, not sure I can hold out for the Switch version. Might need to grab a cheap used XBO.				
					It's on pc as well! Gamepass, even! 				
					I only have a Dell laptop from like 2007, lol. They need to get this out on Switch ASAP...like before Christmas break would be great.				
					It’s also on PS4, if you have that.				
					I will play this after I'm satisfied* with Disco Elysium.   *being satisfied will probably involve include multiple playthroughs.				
					YES! I knew it was going to own, good thing I am already pre-ordered on the PC and ready to go! Friday is going to own \m/ :) \m/ and be a good day. Thanks for the write up! [ Q ] regarding the loot system, I have scene videos that show that the loot is graded by levels(1,2,3 etc) is it also colour graded(white, green, blue, purple, orange, yellow)? TIA				
					valcan_s, the fact that you're not a gamepass subscriber shocks me. 				
					I can't stand the idea of not owning a game or really anything that I want, that concept bothers Me even if I think it's an amazing deal which it is. Might sound crazy, but I can't support game passes on any platform. Basically I think it de values games in the long run and makes gamers not appreciate games in regards to the opposite which is saving up and buying it out and only owning games that a person really wants. Having said that in My current situation I can see how anyone would think that a game pass was made for Me(that makes sense for sure). Also I make a point to support the games and developers I like as much as Humanly possible so I buy them out and also double dip on GOG when ever I can. It's weird I know :) , just roll with it.				
					you can buy the games at a discount...				
					That is a really solid point, I never thought of it that way. GMG does that as well though so you can skip the monthly fee if you want games at a discount for free. Having said that the try full games as long as you want is pretty incredible with the pass. Bottom line it's an amazing service and I have always thought so regardless of the other stuff I mentioned.				
					In no way do I have an argument against anything you said, which is also the reason I find exclusives to be absolute insanity.  But I will say that every single rumbling I've heard coming out of the companies that have been bought by / sold on Microsoft Game Pass has been positive! So!				
					Yeah it is crazy, Man I am very glad of this for I do worry for those Devs/Games ""But I will say that every single rumbling I've heard coming out of the companies that have been bought by / sold on Microsoft Game Pass has been positive! So!"" It be very cool if it was super positive and helped everyone in the long run, we just have to believe.				
					Does anyone know if cross-play / cross-save is allowed for Xbox / PC? 				
					Not mentioned on the Xbox Gamepass site so it's looking like a hard no.				
					Is there a FOV setting?				
					The FOV setting on PC goes up to 120.				
					Is there prostitution?				
					I don't believe so, no. If there is I didn't run into it while reviewing the game. 				
					Apparently the PC version is pretty solid. Can't wait. Light and fun, easy to get into RPG is exactly what I've been missing in my gaming life lately.				
					My review was based on a PC copy. No crashes. Don't recall any glitches at all. I would get a tiny bit of rendering weirdness outside, with objects (usually a small rock or bush) popping in. I played in 2560x1440 and was getting about 100 (or more) frames per second with everything cranked as high as it could go.				"
The Outer Worlds,Matt Martin,VG247,https://www.vg247.com/2019/10/23/outer-worlds-review/,"
In an alternative timeline, Bethesda made Fallout 5 instead of 76 and cleaned up its bugs.That imaginary timeline isn't far from the Hellscape we inhabit in 2019, except it's Bethesda buddies Obsidian that have taken the Fallout formula, cleaned up the sloppy implementation and refined an adventure RPG that has all the early signs of evolving into its own series. The Outer Worlds may reach across planets, but it's smaller in scale that Fallout 4 and New Vegas. It's a focused game with a joyously conceived world, society and politics, making exploration and conversation with the locals flow like swirling currents. You're unlikely to get lost or lose track of your objectives when such snappy dialogue tumbles out of mouths. There's always a zinging one-liner to give you a sign-posted push in the right direction. Who doesn't want to flirt with a pharmacist for free drugs? Why would you say no to a mission that asks you to retrieve dinosaur robot porn?




Watch on YouTube    
Although you're exploring multiple planets and space stations, it's as familiar as the Wasteland or Commonwealth. The Outer Worlds is draped in sci-fi Americana, with a little bit of the Wild West thrown in for good measure. It has its own version of VATS where you slow down time to pinpoint better shots and cause more damage. It has a wealth of perks to choose from, sassy companions who need your help, and romantic dilemmas to get involved with. You will hack, loot, upgrade at benches and sneak past guards who really should be able to spot a party of three knee-crouching like something out of a bad panto. There's even a cute mascot or two to rival Vault Boy. An early part of the main questline has you wrestle with a big moral decision like you're back in Nuketown playing with The Power of the Atom. Todd Howard must be doing his nut in.Still, while it borrows heavily from Bethesda to the point of someone from the legal department drafting a stern letter, it's also confident in its own strengths. The clear highlight of The Outer Worlds is its dialogue and characters. The locals are quick witted, or drunk and stupid, horny, aggressive, depressed, pissed off, cynical, caustic, hyped up, ignorant, condescending and angry. They're a hoot, and it feels like every branch of conversation spins off into its own drama, tale of revenge, loss or friendship. It's refreshing and noticeable that the world isn't populated by boring white men asking you to do gruff military stuff. One of the first romance options you come across isn't about your personal love interests, but trying to facilitate a get together between two characters admiring each other from afar. It's genuinely sweet, even for a cynical, old, black-hearted bastard like myself. There's a lot more fun to be had spending quality time with the locals than fighting the mercenaries and monsters that lurk outside of town.  
 
""For those that were disappointed with Fallout 76 going online multiplayer, this is the single-player RPG you've been looking for""That's not to say combat is bad, but it is flavourless. The Outer Worlds is a better RPG and adventure game than a shooter, so it's a shame that it litters unexplored areas with so many enemies. It can feel like a slog churning through them to get to the next interesting populace. Enemy AI tends to default between charging like a bloke on a Saturday after nine pints, or just floating in the distance spitting venom and bullets at you. Your best approach is either send in your companions to do the dirty work, unload everything you have, or run away. There's also an abundance of cash and ammo on the default settings, which may be an admission that you'll want to blast through combat to get to the better bits. If violence and risk is your thing, tougher difficulties will make your companions mortal. But again, I'd rather try a second playthrough with a different attitude and stats than simply making combat harder.And while it borrows from the best, it doesn't stretch itself or risk innovation. The Outer Worlds never goes too deep in any one direction. Sure, you can upgrade and tinker with your stats, but you'll never get lost in the system or fall down a rabbit hole to really refine your character build. There's a neat little flaw system in play that adapts to your style; if you get your ass kicked by a lot of robots, for example, you can choose to accept a phobia and weakened stats in exchange for an extra perk. It's a shame then that perks are so functional. They may help you carry more, or do more damage, but there's little of the inventiveness of Fallout's vampire Hematophage perk, or the Mysterious Stranger. That feels like a missed opportunity in a game brimming with wit, but maybe it's something that would develop for a sequel. It also commits a few basic RPG sins we thought were on their way to the bin in 2019, such as forcing you to choose stats before you've barely played the game. But when it's hitting you with good gags at character creation with all the perky confidence of a Barden Bella on enrollment day, it's a niggle you can forgive quite easily.  
 
It doesn't feel right to praise a game for not having ugly or game-breaking bugs, but it's something we associate with this genre of sprawling single-player RPG. In The Outer Worlds' case then, Bethesda should really take note. Aside from some basic pop-up entering larger areas, I've come across no evidence of weird graphical glitches, busted questlines, disappearing items, weird animations or any of the other sloppiness we've become used to in recent Fallout games. Congratulations on not being broken, The Outer Worlds. That said, this is a much less physical world than Bethesda’s, which are usually littered with props that the game has to remember the location of. Most of The Outer Worlds’ items exist in menus.  I usually play these games with a build that errs on the side of violence when it comes down to it. I'm happy to play with a nasty attitude and blunder through killing and insulting people if I think there's more in it for me. But The Outer Worlds had me considering my violent acts, pulling me back from the brink on a number of occasions when I thought I'd already made my mind up how to deal with a situation. That's a testament to the great writing and characterisation, and it's this that The Outer Worlds should be celebrated for above all else.The Outer Worlds serves a need and fills a gap very neatly at the end of this console generation. The charm of The Outer Worlds lends itself to water-cooler tales and other moments to share, and certainly more than one playthrough adopting alternative styles. It's safe, but very welcoming. I can even see it developing into sequels if Microsoft chooses to support it and the fans embrace it, which I have no doubt will happen - some games are just made to cosplay. For those that were disappointed with Fallout 76 going online multiplayer, this is the single-player RPG you've been looking for. If you're hankering for somewhere you can while away the hours talking shit, chuckling and prodding at the locals, you won't be disappointed. Version tested: PS4.

Fallout Worlds is one of the best... ahem, sorry, I keep slipping with the name. This week's The Outer Worlds is a brand-new game, set in a brand-new universe, but in nearly every way that counts, it's a Fallout game.For one, the team at Outer Worlds creators Obsidian Entertainment includes team members from the original Fallout's development. That team later stretched its ""3D Fallout"" wings in 2010 by making the revered Fallout: New Vegas. So much pedigree, plus a late-2018 trailer that looked Fallout as all get-out, set serious expectations for this week's game launch on Windows 10, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4.Even if you were to start playing Outer Worlds oblivious to those facts, you wouldn't need long to feel a sense of déjà vu. The Bethesda series' trappings, for one, are all over this offline, single-player Obsidian game. Create a character with a wide range of combat and non-combat ratings—and make tough decisions on which of those abilities to spend the most points on. Then dive into a first-person RPG where the game teases a ridiculous number of options and strategies to proceed.Want to be a goodie two-shoes? Follow quests' orders and avoid combat. Want to raise hell? Ignore your stated objectives, kill anything that annoys you, and pick up useful weapons, items, and keys that still somehow get you to the end. In either case, expect a ton of characters in a ton of cities to offer a ton of dialogue.On paper, that above description should've been 2015's Fallout 4. But opinions on that game were divided, and I counted among our staff's most disappointed players. Its plot dragged with boring characters and unclear momentum. Its world looked chunky, repetitive, and ugly—and not in an ""it's the apocalypse"" way, either. The world was redundant. Its ""settlement"" system required too much investment with too little payoff. For every blip of surprise, excitement, and power armor, so much of the package otherwise felt flat.But what if someone went back to the Fallout 3 wheel, with a clear understanding of what made Fallout's questing, 3D exploration, and choice-filled quests so addictive, and doubled down on that formula, complaints of ""too familiar"" be damned?You'd get The Outer Worlds.The Outer Worlds is a dizzying, dense shot at reclaiming the indisputable glory of Fallout: New Vegas, and the results show a studio that knows its source material well enough to understand what's worth reinventing and what's worth leaving alone.It's a stubborn game, made precisely for people who want the same sensations as FO3 and FO:NV, but it's also not a lazy retread. The writing is rich. Quality-of-life tweaks line every step of the way. Unnecessary clutter is gone.Crucially—at the precise moments the new-game smell wears off, and certain rudimentary and grindy tasks threaten to slow the game's momentum down—is when The Outer Worlds' pieces come together. That's when enough plot threads have unraveled for players to grab onto and when enough superpowers emerge for players to find their own badass path to blasting off these godforsaken rocks. Say hello and hell-yes to this year's ultimate confluence of familiar, refreshing, rich, twitchy, and fun in gaming's 3D-RPG universe.The year is 2351-ish... in a 1950s ""this is what the future will look like"" way. The planets of Outer Worlds' universe are dominated by art deco, cigarettes, lasers, baseball (albeit a futuristic version), and colorful worlds seemingly ripped from Hollywood's Technicolor era. You land in this far-from-Earth solar system, dubbed Halcyon (named after its star), as one of thousands who went into cryo-sleep on a colonization vessel roughly one century earlier. You'd signed onto the promise that you'd wake on a new colony in a few years.Instead, you remained asleep on a ship that was left for dead. Your existence was covered up by The Board, the corporate cabal that runs this game's human-populated universe. Your ship, The Hope, became the stuff of urban legend—but a renegade researcher and doctor by the name of Phineas Welles eventually found your ship parked near an isolated ice planet. You're the only frozen colonist he was able to save.Welles launches you via an escape pod, then puts a hefty responsibility on your shoulders: wanna help expose the truth, bring down the Board, and possibly save the rest of your crewmates? Phineas suffers from some health issues, he says, so he can only help you by talking into your helmet's earpiece and making radio calls on your behalf.You take control after crash-landing on a puny planet whose denizens have been roiled by Halcyon's unfeeling corporate overlords in various ways. You're stuck on this planet, because your plan to blast off into space with a helpful accomplice went screwy. Now you need a power source to get a different spaceship beyond your landing site's atmosphere. A standard tutorial mission plays out in very Fallout 3 style: use melee, guns, stealth, dialogue, and general exploration to reach your next destination by any means necessary. Whatever you choose to do will likely rack up your ""experience points"" bar, even if you ignore kind citizens' pleas and become a murderous sociopath.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

The Outer Worlds,Brandon Adams,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-for-nintendo-switch-review/,"The Outer Worlds launched last October to strong reviews, but the Nintendo Switch port was no where to be seen. Turns out it wasn’t quite ready for the limelight, and developer Obsidian and port-partner Virtuos eventually revealed The Outer Worlds would drop on the Nintendo Switch in March of 2020. Then COVID-19 shut everything down, and the port was indefinitely delayed.Here we are – finally at the end of the tunnel – and The Outer Worlds is out on the Switch. Does it reach the same lofty heights as Virtuos’ more recent ports, or was it pulled out of cryogenic storage too soon? Well, we didn’t write new reviews for either BioShock: The Collection, or the Borderlands Legendary Collection because we felt those ports lived up to their original releases, yet here we are . . . .Let’s get this out of the way out of the gate: Virtuos’ recent ports were of last-gen games with some current-gen upgrades, whereas The Outer Worlds is very much a modern game. Virtuos had their work cut out for them, though formerly “impossible” ports like The Witcher 3 on the Nintendo Switch proved a capable team could in fact make even the most visually lush and graphically demanding games work on Nintendo’s hybrid console without sacrificing every bell and whistle.Sadly, The Outer Worlds does not join the board of excellent Switch ports. It’s barely capable of grabbing their coffee. It is a rough looking, mediocre performing addition to the Switch’s growing third-party library, though it’s clear Virtuos tried their damnedest to get this one over the line (so much so that much of what you’re going to read below had to be rewritten at the 11th hour thanks to a Day 1 patch that brought performance up from “terrible” to “mostly acceptable.” The joys of early code).The work they put into making The Outer Worlds even playable on the Nintendo Switch is immediately obvious the moment you land in the Emerald Vale. Unless you haven’t played the game yet, it’s evident that the graphical adjustments made to The Outer Worlds are on the extreme end of the spectrum. Textures are even lower resolution than those found on PC at the lowest settings, lighting is washed out and what real-time shadows did survive the purge are lumpy messes, foliage and trees are missing by the forest, and on average the resolution is well below the “targeted” thresholds.This was all in docked, mind you. Handheld fares far worse, with a dynamic resolution that is more often than not sitting at half the targeted 720p resolution. This is a muddy, ugly looking port when the game is able to reach peak resolution (usually when your indoors), but in play, out in the world, it’s like I’m playing a forgotten PlayStation 2 title.The UI sticks to 1080p and 720p in both docked and handheld respectively, which is a boon considering how murky the overall image is. Even when standing directly in front of a Spacer’s Choice billboard the textures are low enough to render it nigh unreadable. That’s assuming they load of course, because even with the Day 1 HD textures most assets take upwards of thirty seconds to swap over to their more legible counterparts. Switch ports of modern games typically require many graphical nips and tucks to run on the system’s mobile hardware, but The Outer Worlds has had whole organs removed.Even the game’s unique, stylized art design can’t overcome these vast reductions and removals. Everything in the game looks flat and lifeless, and because texture streaming takes an eon to cycle between “incredibly shitty textures” to “mostly shitty textures” the vast majority of assets in the port appear as if they’re placeholders from an alpha build. There were even times where I would physically outrun the rendering pipepline and either be stopped dead in my tracks as the game froze with a buffering icon, or find myself in an area where entire assets – such as characters, props, and static shadows – had yet to load.If you don’t believe me then compare these two screenshots of the Botanical Labs outside Edgewater in the Emerald Vale – the first here is from the PC version running at the lowest settings available at 720p resolution:And the second is from the Nintendo Switch port running as low as it can go in handheld mode:Even The Witcher 3, which is arguably a more difficult game for the Switch to run, looks better than this. The culling of visual quality is so stark, and the resolution drops so extreme, that you’d hope the game could at least hold a stable 30 frames-per-second. Before the Day 1 patch that was no where near the case, but since the update it does come closer than it did before.To give you an idea as to how bad performance was prior to the patch, here’s a snippet from the original draft of this review I wrote prior to this last minute Hail Mary: “the only time I held a stable 30 frames-per-second in The Outer Worlds for the Nintendo Switch was when I was indoors and had absolutely no one near me. The moment an enemy or NPC entered the scene the frame-rate started to drop into the mid to low twenties, and when in the middle of a firefight with alpha effects popping off it fell as low as the mid-teens.”Thank the Board this isn’t the case any longer, because prior to the patch the performance was so bad I couldn’t soundly recommend this port to anyone. I mean . . . it’s still a hard port to recommend at its current price-point, but more on that in a bit. Needless to say there are still issues with performance, and combat out in the world continues to cause the frame-rate to drop; it’s simply tolerable now, as compared to unplayable.To be blunt, if you have any other way to play The Outer Worlds then the Nintendo Switch port is a hard sell. If you only own a Switch then it’s passable, but it’ll cost you more to play it on Nintendo’s hybrid than any other platform (gotta love that “Switch Tax”). The port looks terrible, and performance is so middling that it’s hard to suggest it to anyone other than the faithful dying to take The Outer Worlds on the go. An ugly Switch port of a popular third-party title can usually justify its existence if, at a minimum, it runs well in handheld mode. The Outer Worlds barely clears that hurdle, and comes with a premium price-tag.The Outer Worlds for the Nintendo Switch is selling for the full $60 retail price. Considering the quality of the port and how cheap the game can be purchased elsewhere this feels like a bit of an insult. If you have a budget PC or an Xbox you can play The Outer Worlds for less than $10 thanks to Xbox Game Pass. You can buy it for half-off at the time of this review on the PlayStation 4. Hell, you can find a physical release for either the Xbox or PlayStation sitting around $40 to $30 these days. There are so many superior ways to play The Outer Worlds that the full retail price here makes it all the harder to suggest the game.I went into The Outer Worlds on Nintendo Switch with high hopes: if The Witcher 3 could find a home on the Switch, then so could Obsidian’s recent gem – especially if the savants behind the sublime Borderlands and BioShock ports were handling it. But reality is often cruel, and it likes to remind us nothing is certain. The Day 1 patch certainly came to the rescue, and it was enough to convince me that maybe, just maybe, the game will improve over time, but the quality at launch doesn’t hold much bang for your dollar.The Outer Worlds for the Nintendo Switch is an admirable, yet mediocre port of an otherwise great game – end of story. It runs well enough to justify its existence, but at the current asking price you’re better off playing Obsidian’s latest elsewhere.

The Outer Worlds,Nicola Ardron,God is a Geek,https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-switch-review-switch-report/,"5 June, 2020I am going to get this out of the way, I am a big fan of The Outer Worlds. I played it on Xbox and thoroughly enjoyed the dark humour, characters, the setting and the world. Playing an action RPG that asks you to make decisions, many of them moral judgements about the plight of different people, set against the backdrop of extreme corporate feudalism seems weirdly prescient of a future not too far off. And certainly with the events of recent months, way closer than I previously thought.The story and style will be familiar to many players. The Outer Worlds feels in many ways an extension of Obsidian’s widely acclaimed work on Fallout New Vegas, with smart, tongue-in-cheek dialogue and a cast of memorable crew mates and NPCs. The combat, too, has a familiar rhythm to it, with Fallout’s VATS system translated here to TTD or Tactical Time Dilation. It has a different name, but functions in exactly the same way; time is slowed and, with the addition of perks, different areas of the enemy can be targeted.The Outer Worlds on Switch works smoothly, with a relatively stable frame-rate, however there is some slow down during particularly hectic fights, and noticeable texture pop-in when moving through areas. Load times between transition areas can feel a little lengthy as well, but they give you time to appreciate the gorgeously detailed and irreverent load screens. A launch day patched has been promised though, which will hopefully iron out some of the more noticeable kinks.If graphical performance is a priority for you, I would suggest you skip this version. Colours are washed-out and there is a significant reduction in the draw distance, with a gentle fogging of objects further away. Even in hand-held mode you can see that the vibrancy and fidelity of the visuals have experienced a downgrade from other versions; in docked this becomes even more apparent. That isn’t to say that The Outer Worlds doesn’t show its beauty in the Switch version. The art direction is excellent, with a very strong sense of style. There is a timeless quality to it, and even with the slightly washed-out colours it stands out. The sky boxes don’t quite have the same arresting quality, but there’s still plenty to marvel at if this is the first time you’ve played.The unique features of the Switch console make playing something like The Outer Worlds a different experience to playing on another console. The ability to switch to hand-held and play an expansive RPG like this, curled up in your bed, does make an attractive proposition. I think that the graphical downgrade actually makes the hand-held mode my preferred option, as much of the texture pop and draw-distance fade is not as noticeable on the smaller screen. Incidentally, a lot of my criticism of games in hand-held revolves around the size of the text, and whilst it is on the small side on the smaller screen, the font choice and colour make it much easier to read than I anticipated.The Outer Worlds on Switch is a good port to the console. It perhaps wouldn’t be my first choice if I had other options as it does perform and look better on more powerful systems, but I have thoroughly enjoyed exploring the world again. If this is your first time playing the game then you have a well-written, amusing and striking role-playing game to work your way through.Strong art direction
Excellent writing
Meaningful & difficult player choicesColours are washed out
Some frame dips in busy areas
Texture pop-in The Outer Worlds on Switch is a good port of a great game. Some of the graphical fidelity is lost, but a strong art direction and excellent writing make this version worth picking up Your home for all your videogame needs.

The Outer Worlds,Mick Fraser,God is a Geek,https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-review/,"October 25, 2019Mistaken identity is hardly a new trope in video game writing, but it’s rarely handled in such a deliberately tongue-in-cheek way as it is in The Outer Worlds. Awoken from hypersleep early by decidedly dodgy outlawed scientist Phineas Welles, your protagonist is bundled into an escape pod and sent hurtling towards the surface of Terra 2 to meet with smuggler and adventurer, Captain Alex Hawthorne of the Unreliable. Unfortunately, after a rather unfortunate series of events, you’re soon calling yourself Alex Hawthorne and taking control of his freighter. Well, once you find a power source to get it back star-side, that is.Such is the opening of The Outer Worlds, a gleefully grim (or grimly gleeful) space-western set in a far-future galaxy where mega-corporations own everything: worlds, sports teams, human lives. A person is nothing if not employed, and people dance to advert jingles and worship brands, not gods. It’s worth knowing on your way in that this is very, very much a Fallout game in all but name. Fans of Bethesda’s somewhat fallen idol will be instantly familiar with many of the systems, including the ones that have been tweaked like copied homework. For example, the slow motion, appendage-targeting V.A.T.S system is here called TTD, or Tactical Time Dilation, a side-effect of being thawed out of hypersleep so quickly. It works in much the same way, slowing time to allow you to do extra damage to targeted areas, and rewarding you with a slow motion kill cam shot for your trouble.Reward is a big part of The Outer Worlds, in fact, and Obsidian seem to delight in giving you things and watching your little face light up. New weapons and weapon-types come at you thick and fast, you level up at a fair pace, unlocking a new perk at every even level, and you earn XP for everything, even for locating new areas or winning dialogue rolls. The loop takes hold of you early and hangs on tight, even factoring in permanent debuffs called “flaws”, which work counter to perks. If you take too much physical damage in a short space of time, for instance, you could receive a flaw that sees you taking more melee damage from that point on. Some of these flaws can be refused, but if you take them you will unlock another perk point in return, so there’s a cost-benefit analysis to do every time.Another system that feels similar to a certain other franchise is the dialogue. People face you square on, fully voicing their lines while you select responses from a drop down menu. Occasionally one of your character skills will factor in, such as Perception or Science, allowing you to steer the conversation in your favour. Each skill has a numerical value assigned based on points you spend when you level up, and as long as the number is at least equal to the required value, you’ll win. It’s not a new system but it’s effective, especially as some of the writing is so good. There’s more to the NPCs of the Halcyon system than just giving you busy work to do, and you can push most people you talk to into opening up. Your companions, six in total, have colourful personalities that will react not only with one another but with people you meet and things you do.Each companion has their own reasons for tagging along with you, and they all have their own backstory and purpose. In addition to just being another gun in a gunfight, they can extend their expertise to you. For example, first recruit Parvati is a novitiate engineer intent on cutting her teeth on the Unreliable’s battered engines, and her presence in the party (you can have two with you at any time) will increase your Engineering skill, allowing you to apply her knowledge to the world and conversations. As a result of this, every foray outside your ship could potentially go differently depending on who you take with you. You could make different allies, avoid a tough fight, or completely ruin your standing with one of the various factions. I don’t know how deep it goes, but the potential for replayability is high – which is a boon, because The Outer Worlds isn’t a 60-hour open world epic.Areas in the game are separated, and you’ll need to travel between each one in a way more akin to something like Dragon Age than Fallout. Many towns have vast areas around and between them that you can trek across, but sooner or later those areas will be walled off and you’ll need the Unreliable to go further. Exploration is vital, though, as you’ll encounter scores of side quests and hidden curiosities, not to mention local wildlife that evokes memories of Borderlands. Almost everything you kill or search will yield something worth collecting, from weapons and armour to vendor trash, crafting materials, and collectibles. The various locales of The Outer Worlds are fizzing with flavour, from data-pads and terminals you can hack to NPCs with stories to tell.As you progress through the story you’ll align yourself with one or more factions vying for various end-goals, either greater control of the System, freedom from oppression or maybe just better quarterly finance reports. You’ll investigate relay stations that have lost communication, deal with infestations of alien horrors, come into possession of a shrink-ray, and save the residents of a space station from being cooked alive. Maybe you’ll work out why there are suddenly woolly-haired cows in your engine room, which had me stumped for a while. Or you might not do those things; the important take-away is that your choices will shape the story you tell around the water cooler with your friends, and you may find your experiences very different to theirs. Stealth plays a part, too, offering you even more ways to approach situations. Interestingly, you’ll receive a device early on that projects a holographic cloak around you, which allows you to disguise yourself as various different guards or personnel provided you have the data card to do so. It’s a cool system that not only adds tension to infiltration, but forces you to use your wits if you get found out, as you’ll be given three opportunities to talk your way out of trouble. Of course, such choice and variety often come at a price, and that price here is performance. I want to be clear that compared to other games of the genre, The Outer Worlds feels refreshingly polished. NPC models use the character creator, but the lip-synching and expressions are above average – as are some of the performances (Parvati in particular stands out for me). The issues instead manifest as drops in frame rate, and texture pop-in, both of which are noticeable and frequent in certain areas. The latter is a particular problem on the inventory screen where it takes several seconds to apply textures to your protagonist’s armour. I haven’t encountered any actual bugs or glitches though, which is surprising considering how beautiful The Outer Worlds looks a lot of the time. Environments do reuse assets quite a lot, especially in settlements where you’ll often see the same exact room with some of the furniture rearranged in two different buildings, but, my word, some of the sky-boxes are breathtaking.Ultimately, if you’ve played a Fallout game before, you won’t be surprised by many of The Outer Worlds’ systems and features, but each familiar idea is tweaked just enough to feel different if not unique. A wealth of side quests and places to explore ensure that you can never quite predict what’s over the next horizon, and some surprisingly intelligent and thoughtful writing shoots a bolt of maturity through the satirical atmosphere that provides levity and occasional pause for thought. The retro-futuristic, space western style may be nothing new in 2019, but The Outer Worlds approaches it with such undeniable charisma that you can’t help but be drawn into its colourful, diverse universe. And what’s more, it’s so confidently written and lovingly made that you’ll almost certainly want to go back for another adventure when you’re done.Looks gorgeous
The writing is excellent at times
Player choice feels meaningful
So many sidequestsNot many new ideas

The Outer Worlds,William Schwartz,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds/,"Obsidian Entertainment is known for some of the most beloved role-playing games of all time, they’ve also made some poor ones.  On one hand, this is the studio that made Fallout: New Vegas — probably the most highly-acclaimed game in the series since it went first-person open world.  They’re the studio that made the popular follow-up to Bioware’s KOTOR, but they’re also the studio that made Alpha Protocol and Dungeon Siege III.  The point is, it’s never quite clear which Obsidian is going to show up in a given game.  With The Outer Worlds, we land somewhere in the middle of the quality scale.  There’s a lot to love about Obsidian’s latest, and there’s a lot that’s going to leave some players on the fence.Much of what’s been said about The Outer Worlds is that it’s like Fallout: New Vegas.  I’d like to start out by saying that this isn’t that game.  It looks like that game.  It even plays somewhat like that game, but it’s not quite the scale of New Vegas, though it does have some well written characters.  So long as you know that this is something different, you might not be disappointed.  But those looking for that Fallout replacement after the disappointment that Fallout 76 was, you’re not going to find it here.The Outer Worlds is a sci-fi tale where you play the role of a colonist whose ship to the Halcyon galaxy gets put into stasis for around 70 years. A scientist named Phineas Welles wakes you out of your slumber to help him and sets you loose on the planets of the system to discover why the colonists all remain asleep all these years later.  The story from this point really does depend on your actions.  Although the main path of the game is fairly narrow, there are many different moving parts along the way.  There are factions to help or hurt, people to meet and recruit to your cause, and a ton of different loot and skills to earn and learn.The Outer Worlds biggest strength is in the writing of all of the different characters in the game.  Like any good RPG, some of the best stuff is tucked away behind a ton of dialogue and in off the beaten path areas of the world.  You really can shape the world to your liking though, through any of the choices that you make along the way.  Your different dialogue options allow you to dig into the relationships between characters and push into directions that aren’t immediately clear from the onset of a relationship.  Or you can abandon talking altogether and just wipe a central character completely out of the narrative (except for a handful).  With The Outer Worlds, you can completely change the course of history for Halcyon by choosing to align yourself with different characters.  While the main choice is somewhat binary as you move towards the end-game, there are plenty of moving parts on the periphery that do change the outcomes and the endings that you experience.That said, there’s a good bit of replayability in The Outer Worlds and if you really want to see it all you’ll either be doing a lot of save scumming in this game, or you can play it on various difficulty levels.  While it does feel pretty easy on the default skill level, bumping it up to hard mode which gives enemies more health and damage will really make you engage with the systems of the game.  For those that really want the full immersive experience we recommend playing it on the Supernova Difficulty which has a bunch of additional challenges, the least of which are the survival elements that require you to eat, drink, and sleep to survive along with a bunch of other settings that make life a little bit more difficult.But those systems are many, so it’s a shame that the lower difficulties don’t really make you engage with them as much as you would like.  There are weapons upgrades and repairs to deal with.  Same goes for armor.  You’ve got a whole system of perks and skills to unlock as you earn points for leveling up.  These help you do things like improve your hacking, lock-picking, weapon or armor proficiencies, speech craft and more.  And these systems are where plenty of the comparisons to New Vegas will come into play.  Improving things like your lock-picking, hacking or speech craft will allow you to access dialogue options and/or areas of the world that you might not be able to get to without.  Sometimes you can get outcomes to conversations that just aren’t possible without a certain level of persuasion, intimidation, or lying ability.  Same goes for hacking or lock-picking.  Some levels have alternate areas or weapons tucked away that you couldn’t get without the either finding a key card or having the ability to pick a lock or hack a terminal.The Outer Worlds isn’t one big open world.  It’s actually a handful of planets and other areas that you can land on and visit through your ship, the Unreliable.  The Unreliable acts as your home base where you and your crew can assemble for the next mission at hand.  While it does serve a purpose on the aforementioned Supernova difficulty, it really doesn’t have as big a place in the game on the others.  The planets and areas that you can travel to all do have a unique look to them, but the enemy variety that you’ll find on them feels somewhat lacking.  Fights are largely first person shooting or melee combat, and you can choose to bring companions with you when exploring or on a mission.  There is some control over the A.I. companions, including the ability to direct special abilities and which enemies your companions target.Your weapons and armor, as well as your companion weapon and armor are completely controlled by you.  You can outfit yourself in any way that you want, whether you want to wear a top hat and light armor or regular clothes or heavy armor that blocks significant damage.  There are a bunch of different systems at play when it comes to weapons as the game has numerous weapon types which fire light, heavy, or energy bullets and there are numerous types of damage effects like Acid, Bleed, Burn, and more with different types of enemies being susceptible to different damage types.  On the armor side of the equation, while you can go for straight damage protection with high armor stats, light armor or helmets deliver different skill bonuses that can give you upgrades to a number of different skill areas.  All that said, The Outer Worlds has a deep enough set of systems to dig into for those that really want to experience the hardest challenges of the game.  For those that just want the broad strokes of the main path, there’s little reason to dig too far.The gunplay of The Outer Worlds is OK.  I couldn’t quite tell what felt off about it and a colleague explained that it was aim assist that was missing.  For a console game to not have aim assist is a little bit off putting and makes the gun play feel sloppy at times.  There are some unique mechanics that don’t make this quite the twitch shooter that something like Borderlands is (a game that some have compared The Outer Worlds).  You’ve got multiple systems like the Time Dilation Skill which allows you to slow time and target specific spots of an enemy.  This skill has some unlockable features which allow you to see weak spots and location hit effects which can cripple body parts, maim, stagger, and have other effects on an enemy.  If it sounds like a modification of the V.A.T.S. system of the Fallout series, that’s because it kinda is.  So like that game, it’s not straight shooting in The Outer Worlds, but it is mostly a shooter with some other elements that you need to manage along with your A.I. teammates if you choose to fight alongside them.The visual presentation of The Outer Worlds definitely does leave a lot to be desired.  Compared to what we’re seeing from other open world games, this does not stand up to other recent releases on consoles.  Given that this isn’t actually a true open world and a collection of sandbox style levels, you would think they could’ve pushed the limits a little more, and the end result is actually something that feels a little bit dated.  The good news is that there really isn’t that much “jank” which you would expect from a game of this type.  The smaller sandbox areas probably make for finding the problems a little bit easier, so there really isn’t that much of that, unless you consider questionable ragdoll effects the kind of lovable jank that you were expecting.What is truly lovable about this game is the writing and the depth to the conversations that it has.  I can’t remember a mainstream RPG that has had this type of depth to the conversations and the freedom to take them to different places depending on your mood or archetype that you’re committing to.  A mixture of bleak humanity and humor make this a world that you want to explore with people in it that you want to talk to.  And that’s a good thing considering that most of the value on the role play front is had from these aspects of the game.If there is a big downside to The Outer Worlds it’s in that you really have to go seek out the side content, faction missions, and companion quests if you want to get the most out of the game and experience the true flavor of the world.  There’s been plenty put here with a varied cast of unique characters in this world, but it’s really up to you to search out… for the most part.  The main path quest is enjoyable, but there is a lot of interesting stuff that is very easy to miss if you aren’t looking hard enough.  And a single playthrough doesn’t really tell the entire story.  It’s hard to imagine that every player of The Outer Worlds play the game multiple times to see everything or save scum their way through the game, and it’s likely that most people will miss the multiple endings and outcomes that vary quite differently from one another.The Outer Worlds might not be exactly what you think it’s going to be.  It’s a smaller game, one that focuses on replay value and role play fantasy to really get the most out of the experience.  It’s a dense game though, where there’s plenty of lore packed into smaller sandbox style areas.  It’s up to you to poke around in the corners of these areas to get the most out of it.

The Outer Worlds,Imogen Donovan,VideoGamer,http://www.videogamer.com//reviews/the-outer-worlds-review," Posted in Reviews
The Outer Worlds is like Lizzo’s ‘Like a Girl.’ I thought this while on the commute, and it dawned on me a little later that this is a ridiculous thought to think. But, it did happen. And I think I understand why this thought came to be thought; the gospel of Lizzo informs us that she ‘woke up feelin’ like I just might run for President, even if there ain’t no precedent.’ Similarly, I might become the unplanned ultimate authority in this pocket of the galaxy, or I might just save a space colony destined to collapse. Take the path less travelled, or turn around and walk in the other direction. And incredibly enough, there are no right answers, no good end, no wrong way. Obsidian’s managed to create a space opera with conscious themes and consequences, and no one clipped through the floor even once.The game opens with Dr. Phineas Welles, vagabond and eccentric scientist extraordinaire, clambering on board a long-lost human colony ship, called the Hope The player customises their character’s attributes from inside a cryo-chamber. Much like Fallout, these include Strength, Perception, Dexterity, Intelligence, and so on. It’s here where I’m warned that making a stat below average will have knock-on effects in the game. I locked in low intelligence, with a helping of speech skills, and expertise in the shooty-bang side of things. Welles taps frantically on the glass and tells the character they are the Halcyon Colony’s only hope. He revealed that the Board – a collective of powerful individuals who organise the corporations running this corner of the galaxy – has left the ship to rust among the stars. My character is ejected unceremoniously into an escape pod to meet Welles’ valuable contact, Captain Hawthorne, for the next stage in his grand plan. Once I land, I see two legs stretched akimbo in a darkly cosmic Wizard of Oz reference. I’ve squished Captain Hawthorne.The humour continues on this course throughout The Outer Worlds. There are slimy execs only out for themselves, downtrodden workers who believe the Board to be godlike in its powers of execution, fiscal and corporeal. Don’t expect a laugh track or a crash of cymbals with every wisecrack, because the jokes came with a bite that established the game’s anti-capitalist themes. For example, you discover that one employee committed suicide at work. His colleagues complain that it was annoying to take time out of their day to clean his remains off of the walls, but his death actually constituted a corporate crime. His body belonged to the company and damaging it in any way would lead to a hefty fine and disapproval from the Board. This particular planet has fallen on hard times, and it would be the final nail in the coffin if the news reached the top brass.It would be simple and clean to say The Outer Worlds is like Fallout in space. And if it is, it’s more specifically like Fallout: New Vegas in space, and comes with the bells and whistles of a true Obsidian RPG. However, unlike with that game, Obsidian isn’t stepping into the shoes of an established series here, and the consequent artistic freedom looks like a splendid explosion in an art-nouveau print factory. The delicate font choice, though aesthetically pleasing, highlighted just how awful my eyesight is. Elsewhere, chatting to characters results in a zoom on their face, and a bunch of things to say to them, both hallmarks of Fallout: New Vegas. But unlike its spiritual predecessor, these people have fully functioning face muscles and will squint, smile, and furrow their brow as the protagonist challenges or concedes to their outlook on life. Because my character had low intelligence, I got special ‘Dumb’ dialogue options to use in conversation. Characters despaired over my non-existent knowledge of basic concepts, whereas others liked my gumption, and some thought it best to steer clear of a knucklehead wielding a plasma rifle.Pushing The Outer Worlds to its limits reveals its most impressive mechanics. Every action has an equal reaction, and if my skills were too low in hacking or persuasion or melee, only a selection of the multitude of options would be possible. It balances flexibility with inflexibility: if I was to be a bonehead with no appreciation for the sciences, then of course I wouldn’t be able to name-drop the periodic table to gain access to a medical facility.There is always the option to take a traditional approach, though. The Outer Worlds has a conventional selection of weapons and abilities for a role-playing game, and your proficiency with these increases as the character levels up and inputs points into attributes. Stealth is possible, and modifications lets you add silencers and increased magazines to the guns, as well as a host of other upgrades. It’s also got Tactical Time Dilation, which is not Fallout’s V.A.T.S. Kind of. It slows time and reveals weak spots on your enemies, who range from  monstrous Mantiqueens to shopkeepers with whom you’ve had a critical misunderstanding.The combat is fun, and playing with some of the more imaginative weapons in the game is comedic and tactically rewarding. There is even an optional Flaw mechanic, with which players will be awarded an extra perk point if they take on a vulnerability that changes gameplay. I walked over too many mines (how many mines is too many mines?) and I received a Permanent Concussion. I was formerly a half-wit, now I was a no-wit. It meant I got no critical damage bonuses and combat was much harder, even with a heavy weapon, but the game nodded towards my numb skull every so often. You could be a lone ranger in The Outer Worlds, and there are perks specific to a solo experience, but you’d be missing out on its vibrant and volatile cast of characters.The crew you collect along the way include a not-very-holier-than-thou vicar, a pirate with a medical degree, a wayward anarchist, and a sweet but shy engineer. They’ve got their own companion storylines with which you can pick up and drop at any time. As a woman out of time, I valued their opinions and voices on the determinant decisions in the game, and there aren’t any signifiers to say whether they agreed or disagreed with your conclusion. In addition, there are factions on each of the planets, and how you react to their messages and quests will affect their feeling toward you. Unload a magazine or few into the Board’s lackeys and they’ll feel ‘Put Out’. Settle a feud between two warring communities and they’ll think the world of you, but stealing some snacks will still irritate the people you’ve saved. This may seem a little old-hat, but, when I reached the end of the story, The Outer Worlds detailed how each and every one of my decisions altered the fate of the Halcyon colony.The Outer Worlds is Fallout in space, but that isn’t to say you’ve seen it all before. In fact, I believe I haven’t seen the half of what this game can do, and it still allures after a concentrated and compact campaign. I’m sorry to report to Lizzo that I didn’t run the whole damn Outer world but I was sugar, spice, and nice, when needs must. The game was surprising and sparky, letting me do what I liked regardless of whether it meant life, death, chaos, peace, or none of the above. It feels like a familiar Obsidian experience, but the game’s polish shows that the studio is a force to be reckoned with. We’ve waited a while for The Outer Worlds, and it was certainly worth it.Developer: Obsidian EntertainmentPublisher: Private DivisionAvailable on: PC, Xbox, PlayStation 4 [reviewed on].Release Date: October 25, 2019To check what a review score means from us, click here.

The Outer Worlds,Jason Wilson,GamesBeat,https://venturebeat.com/2019/10/22/the-outer-worlds-review-even-the-final-frontier-cant-hide-from-corporate-greed/,"Connect with top gaming leaders in Los Angeles at GamesBeat Summit 2023 this May 22-23. Register here.As I played The Outer Worlds, I kept thinking about the Alien films. The two share a dystopian future in which corporations wield far too much power over the galaxy. But where Alien uses terror and bloodthirsty monsters to hammer home its message, Obsidian Entertainment and The Private Division deploy a quick wit and sharp satire to show what happens when mega-conglomerates, not governments, rule the final frontier.The Outer Worlds is a role-playing game that comes out October 25 for the PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. I reviewed it on the PS4, and I found a wickedly funny skewering of corporations. It’s a RPG with smart character-building and some satisfying dungeon design. Combat could be better, and the world is full of people who look like they were cloned from the same half-dozen archetypes. This didn’t stop me from enjoying it, and I look forward to returning to it as soon as I finish writing this review.Check out our Reviews Vault for past game reviews.It’s funnyGamesBeat Summit 2023Join the GamesBeat community in Los Angeles this May 22-23. You’ll hear from the brightest minds within the gaming industry to share their updates on the latest developments.The best part of The Outer Worlds is its humor. It’s sharp. Some of its jokes are easy one-liners dealing with your current situations, but most of it goes deeper, either developing into short bits (such as one about the use of serial commas, one that I felt was made just for me) or into a recurring theme of roasting corporate culture.The humor starts early, turning a joke about bureaucrats into part of building your character. You find people all over the Halcyon sector (these are the colonies in The Outer Worlds’ corner of space) hewing to corporate lingo and jingles. The de facto leader of an abandoned colony speaks like he’s still filling out TPS reports for his bosses. The names of many of the corporations — such as Spacer’s Choice (does this ring a bell?) or Auntie Cleo (its logo reminds me of Mom from Futurama) — are little jokes. Later, a Spacer’s Choice employee sounds like a pitchman even after you save them from the jaws of hungry raptidons (one of the aggressive fauna standing in the way of corporate expansion). Another worker wears a moon-shaped hat with a ridiculous face on it, and he tells you in hushed, terrified tones that “you’d never would ask if you knew what it was like in here” when you ask if you can buy the head wear from him.Above: Nope.Or the researcher who discovers that raptidon enzymes can become a diet toothpaste thanks to the power of science … and asks you to help him save his notes from a facility overrun by the beasts and ne’er-do-wells.This comes across as a commentary on those bad bosses we’ve all had in corporations, making one inane and ill-advised decision after another, and those poor sods (namely us) that have to deal with them. You’ll emphasize with some of them, and others will leave you shaking your heads at their stupidity.And in the background, The Board — a group made up of leaders from each of the corporations in this sector — looms over everything, as people bend backward to please their corporate overlords or spit in their faces as they eek out a living while trying to pull free of their influence. For me, The Board shows the dark place some of the humor comes from.Character buildingI’ve long preferred putting points into stats/stat blocks to RPGs that just open up new powers as you advance (hi, Diablo III). The Outer Worlds gives you blocks of stats, such as Melee, Ranged, Defense, and Dialogue, and you pump them up as you see fit. I put a great deal of points into Dialogue, giving me options such as Lie and Persuade when talking to people. Dialogue options are one of my favorite aspects of RPG design, and seeing how these change situations — or better and worse — is satisfying. And it’s key to the some fantastic interactions. Boosting Tech helps you pick locks, deal with computers, and other engineering feats.You also get Perks every few levels, which enhance your combat skills or other abilities. Other Perks reduce the cooldowns of your companions, give your discounts at vending machines, or help you carry more. Your companions get Perks as well.Above: All I had to do to earn this was fall a lot.My favorite part of the skill system is Flaws. You get these for, well, failing. You take a few dings on stats in exchange for a new Perk. I’ve long loved RPG design in which you take on disadvantages for a boost (I first encountered these in Advanced Dungeons & Dragons‘ 2nd Edition Player’s Option line). I got my first Flaw from falling from hills too often (something I could see happening in real life). My second came from taking too much damage against robots.Couple all this with the difficulty settings, and you get a great deal of freedom in how you build your character. Play on the easiest modes, and you don’t need to worry too much about dumping points into combat stats.The loading screen artWhenever The Outer Worlds loads in a new area, it puts up a piece of gorgeous art. It comes from the concepts developed by the art team. These designs, which evoke a style from the 1940s-1950s, look great and add character to the world. Some of these are ad pitches for the companies The Outer Worlds spoofs. Others are dissections of creatures you find.They also reflect your decisions. Events you bring about appear in these loading screens. It’s a neat feature.Decisions matterAbove: This image is the result of your decisions. You may not get it on your playthrough.Early on, you learn the choices you make, the alliances you foster, have ramifications. Every planet you visit, every station you stop at, the decisions you make have the chance to influence, even change the lives of, everyone there. In a story like The Outer Worlds, people should be left dealing with your wake, either for good or ill. It makes you more conscious of your decisions as well.After my actions helped people in one settlement to the detriment of those in a much larger town, I decided to to be a mite more careful. On the next planet, I brought together arguing factions and helped them hammer out a compromise in which they could both live with … and, I hope, prosper together.Bland combatFighting feels like it’s in the way of you exploring and interacting with the people of Halcyon. It’s first-person, like Fallout 4 or The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, but it doesn’t have the draw of those games. Part of it comes from the hordes of marauders you fight on some planets. They feel the same, regardless which world you’re on, and it leads to a number of rote encounters.I do enjoy slowing down time. The “tactical time dilation” feels like the V.A.T.S. system from Fallout (no surprise, since Fallout folk count among Outer Worlds’ designers). It’s helpful for when you want to snipe targets or plan out assaults. I used it sometimes, and I didn’t use it with other encounters, and I didn’t miss it when I skipped it.You can mod weapons, but I keep feeling like the combat designers were pushing me to use machine guns and other weapons with bullets. Most of them just do more damage than energy weapons. I’m in space! Give me cool lasers, blasters, and other sci-fi weapons. If I wanted to fire machine guns, I could play Call of Duty this fall.Picking up lots of loot is a painAbove: Just let me pick it all up at once.When you go into houses, research facilities, and other locations, you’ll often find a lot of items sitting on counters, the floor, and tabletops. Shelves will hold things you can eat and drink.And you have to highlight each, picking them up one by one. It’s tedious. It’s annoying. And it’s archaic. We should be able to press one button to pick up all the stuff scattered around.The Outer Worlds is funny and an effective critique of corporate culture … and the power conglomerates we have in our society. Each world and way station has plenty of quests for you, and most of them have a good little story to accompany them. The characters can be intriguing, subtle, or over-the-top. But you remember them, and that’s saying much more than I can about other RPGs I’ve played this year.My complaints with The Outer Worlds are small, more quality of life things than anything else. Combat will drag, as it does in many RPGs (and yes, I know Obsidian’s isometric combat in Pillars of Eternity can get repetitive as well). Yet the humor, the world-building, and the decisions you face outpace any of my concerns about combat or loot. And it’s an excellent followup to Private Division’s first published game, Kerbal Space Program.The Outer Worlds is Obsidian’s final game as an independent company (it’s now part of Xbox Game Studios), and it’s one helluva swansong.Score: 91/100The Outer Worlds comes out October 25 for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

The Outer Worlds,Alice Bell,"Rock, Paper, Shotgun",https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/10/22/the-outer-worlds-pc-review/,"In space, no one can hear you memeRelease: October 25 2019
On: Windows
From: Epic Games Store
For: £50, $60, €60There are a few times, during Obsidian's rootin' tootin' shootin' lootin' first person space cowboy RPG The Outer Worlds, where the game lampshades the tropes it uses. One of them really stood out to me. An information broker asked me to clear the airwaves he used for his radio signals, meaning I had to convince two rival faction leaders to stop broadcasting. This meant having to do a task for each of them, with each task involving a sub-task. When I handed the quests in, they both had more errands. And so on and so forth. When I finally returned to the broker and he asked me to reset his satellite relay, I was like ""Oh, I bet I have to press three different switches now or whatever"", and he was like ""No, don't be ridiculous, that is a stupid system, who would design that, it's just one button."" And while it's all very well to put that little joke in your game, it won't change the fact that the rest of it is all about finding sets of three switches.In classic Obsidian style, you play as a sort of chosen one, mostly because everyone else is so inept they can't even buy their own hangover pills (this is genuinely a pivotal part of a main story quest, by the way). You are the only colonist successfully reanimated from cryosleep aboard the colony ship Hope, which ended up dropping out of lightspeed and doing the last bit of its journey to the Halcyon colony planets in real time. This took 50 years, however, during which time everyone got on with doing space capitalism and indentured corporate servitude without you. The Halcyon colony is in a bit of a state. Almost everyone and everything is owned by one of a number of corporations, which operate in an insane tangle of bureaucracy, and whether you're on the inside pissing out or outside pissing in, you're probably starving to death. Friendly mad scientist Phineas Welles is tired of this, and woke you up without the permission of the mega-corporate business baddies on The Board, with the broad aim of getting you to fuck shit up, and then eventually unfreezing everyone left on the Hope. You decide how you go about this during character creation, which has some fun space makeup and big noses to choose from. You decide your rough focus by setting Body (punching, dodging), Mind (thinking, noticing) and Personality (talking, leading) attributes -- which do not change as you progress -- and then fine tuning by distributing skill points, which you get more of as you level up. Skills include your different combat abilities: hacking, sneaking, persuasion, all that kind of stuff. You can level them up to 100 points, with milestones granting new buffs and debuffs every 20. 




Watch on YouTube    
This all sets how you'll experience the game largely in stone. While you can, admirably, complete almost every mission by using either combat or not-combat approaches, you won't level up enough to be good at everything -- though I should say that you probably can't avoid combat entirely. Even avoiding most of it will entail a lot of slow crab-walking through grass or hiding behind bins. Luckily, you can collect six different companion characters (tanks, a medic, an engineer, and so on) to cover your weaknesses. Even so, I had much more fun putting points into shooting, though it's a bit ""click to produce numbers"". The Outer Worlds has Time Dilation, see, a purply slow motion ability that's a big copy of Fallout's VATS system. Basically, the only point in having that is to snipe someone's leg off before they even know it's flown off into the bushes behind them. My spacer, Del, was kind of a Han Solo type -- charming, but a dead shot. I got into a politician's home by persuading the post office to hand over a parcel for him (which would normally have taken 35 years to arrive with the requisite forms), and then persuading the guards on the door that I was a real delivery person. Once I was inside, I shot everyone else in the face with a shotgun. Excellent. Pew pew. But once you've decided what sort of gently defrosting rube you are, you notice the grind after a few hours. You rock up at a new location (a township or district or space station) and explore. You encounter the factions at play, who are generally served in either Corporate Stooge or Rebel Outlaw flavours. Still, you sometimes find a caprese salad side dish in the form of people who are Neutral And Out For Themselves. By asking around, you get jobs to do. You make your way through the local population of factionless marauders, swivelly robots, and giant angry fire insects/acid iguanas/rock gorillas, retrieving what you were sent to retrieve. How you retrieve things and who you eventually give them to will raise or lower your standing with the factions. At some point, you realise you've accidentally completed the story mission for an area. Usually, but not always, you will be presented with a choice that ultimately helps or hinders one or other of the factions.Oh, sure: in one town the rebels will be a sort of hippy commune growing their own tomatoes, and in another they'll be a weird religious fringe group - but the parts of the process still feel the same. It's the biggest annoyance in The Outer Worlds, and it's more noticeable because a lot of everything else is identical too, aside from a few ""ooh look at this"" vista reveals. You'll probably run into a lot of people with the same haircut as you, too. It's not that it's not, you know, a romp, but it can't stop nakedly doing impressions of other things you like, like a kid at school going ""What do you like? Yeah I like Douglas Adams too! 42! Belgium! Hahahah!"". Like the Time Dilation I mentioned earlier, and the way the screen zooms into peoples' faces when you have a conversation, and the CRT-ish computer terminals with messages between employees, which are all clearly cribbing from newer Fallouts.Did you enjoy Knights Of The Old Republic? Because one of your companions is a fun robot you've modified to kill people. What about Borderlands? Have fun killing masked marauders as they run at you brandishing big hitting sticks, and picking up lots of guns! Fan of Firefly? You'll love the stark contrast between the grubby spacers living on the edge of poverty in their nu-old west towns, and the bumbling asshole rich guys with bolo ties in charge of it all. Also one of your companions is a priest with a past, and another is a sweet engineer gal in overalls with a southern accent. I dunno what to tell you.It even has a selection of greatest hits in the side quests. Count 'em off: overly friendly family who are definitely cannibals; my parents died and I am a weird man-baby murderer now; smuggler trapped in a cave; hack them robots!; dangerous cross-species experimentation in a secret lab; bring me that specific kind of pie.When The Outer Worlds does travel in more original directions, it's great! Probably my favourite thing in the game is a kind of devil's bargain system, where you can accept a Flaw, brought on by context in the game, in exchange for a valuable Perk point (that is, a powerful buff ability). I got attacked by a bunch of robots and chose to accept Robophobia, meaning I suffered penalties whenever I was around a mechanical bruiser. But then I fixed up the aforementioned robot companion SAM, and discovered that if I had him in my party I was permanently terrified, which I loved. I then accepted almost every flaw I was presented with. It's a relatively small system change that ends up being mad fun.The skewering of corporations is low hanging fruit, but The Outer Worlds' sense of humour is way less scatological than Borderlands, and has little subtleties -- like, one of the loading screens has text that says something like ""Your tutorial tip here!"" like those ads on the back of toilet doors in a Wetherspoons. All the corporate lords are men who are a bit shit at their jobs, while the rebel and indie factions are lead by strong women(™), which I enjoyed even if my eyes began to roll sometimes. You can, at any point, betray Phin, and do the whole game working for the Board. Parvati, the explicitly asexual engineer, asks you for help setting her up on a date with a fellow woman engineer. There's a dude who constantly says the word wink, instead of actually winking, and you have the option to just punch him in the face. You can spend the whole game being an unrelenting asshole to everyone, in fact.The Outer Worlds is alright, innit. It's good fun. Sit back and let the orange and neon wash over you. Boo the cartoonishly evil corporations. Exhale through your nose at their Diet Toothpaste. I bet I'll play it again, in fact. But you can tell it could have been great, if it had taken a few more risks.

The Outer Worlds,Bryan Lawver,GamingTrend,https://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/gilded-space-age-the-outer-world-review/,"When I previewed The Outer Worlds this summer and found that it wasn’t quite clicking, I wondered if it was just because I only had 90 minutes to play when the full game is many times that length. After all, it had some of the elements that I remember best from Fallout: New Vegas (the quirky characters, the mountain of side quests, the vast wasteland to explore, the just-OK combat), but it just wasn’t scratching the same itch. Maybe, I thought, it’s a game that only really feels good when you have the time to see how your moment-to-moment choices ripple out across a longer timespan. Having played the final game, I can say that the section I played earlier just wasn’t a great part of the game and there are plenty of moments that work much better in isolation, even if the full game is less than the sum of its parts.The Outer Worlds follows a structure familiar to anyone who’s played open-world RPGs like Fallout or The Elder Scrolls. You show up in town, chat with NPCs, recruit companions, and wander through the wilderness completing side quests as you slowly pick away at the main mission. In this case, you find yourself awoken from suspended animation by rogue scientist Phineas Welles after he discovers your ship, Hope, which has been adrift in space for decades. You then make your way to Halcyon, a space colony ruled over by a handful of corporations collectively known as the Board, to help Phineas save the crumbling colony. Obsidian has been very open about The Outer Worlds being smaller in scope than other games in the genre, but it feels oddly too big and too small at the same time. It seems to want to keep all the trappings of typical open-world RPGs without the scale to have them make sense, from its mostly empty landscape to its limited companion quests.That’s not to say that there’s no fun to be had within its limited structure. The combat in The Outer Worlds is satisfying but not spectacular, and there’s a wide enough range of weapons that you’ll likely be able to find one that suits you well. I ended up sticking with similar loadouts for most of the game, despite constantly tripping over piles of guns, just because fast-firing weapons with elemental effects gave the most satisfying feedback when they hit their target, something that’s severely lacking in most of the game’s conventional weapons. Regardless of your loadout, your companions can absolutely destroy most enemies in the game with minimal assistance, despite their most advanced tactical option being “stand 10 feet from the first thing you see and shotgun it to death.” If you’re looking for any sort of challenge, I’d recommend cranking the difficulty up to Hard, where baddies at least hit a bit harder and take longer to kill.Combat isn’t the highlight of The Outer Worlds, though. I’d go as far as to say that there’s actually too much combat, given how much more satisfying some of the less action-oriented parts of the game are. The game is full of well-written, funny dialog and has its share of compelling characters among both your allies and enemies. I picked my companions based solely on how much I liked their personality, and the biggest pay-off for most quests came not from the rewards they granted but for the story details and conversations that would happen along the way. While most of its big-picture satire falls completely flat, it’s packed with little one-liners that got some genuine belly laughs out of me.Starting from the first reveal of The Outer Worlds, Obsidian pushed two big selling points: its tongue-in-cheek corporate dystopian setting and the freedom to play however you want. It turns out those are two of the most interesting parts of the game, but they’re interesting for how they fail as much as how they succeed. Trailer after trailer emphasized how you’ll be able to decide not only your own fate in The Outer Worlds, but the fate of the entire Halcyon colony, and it’s true — you can play The Outer Worlds basically any way you want to, but rather than feeling empowering, the result is oddly constraining.The basic form your nominal freedom takes is the ability to customize your character. From an array of skills that will be familiar to any New Vegas player, you’ll distribute experience points you gain every time you level up. Put points into Hack and you’ll be able to take over mechanical enemies or snoop around in strangers’ emails; dump them into 1-Handed Melee and you can pound those rowdy robots into dust with a hammer and just stick to imagining what kind of raunchy things Halcyon’s inhabitants are writing about in their diaries. The Outer Worlds introduces some interesting twists to this familiar system. Each skill belongs to a group, like Ranged or Tech, and putting one point into any group will increase every skill in it up to level 50, at which point you have to start picking specific skills. It’s a helpful system if you just want to progress from terrible to slightly-less-terrible at ranged combat without having to specialize in a particular type of gun while still having enough points to go deep into the skills you really care about. There’s even a skill that lets you gain points in other skills from your companions, which gives you even more freedom to tweak your skill loadout each time you change your party.The trouble comes with how you actually use those skills in the game. The Outer Worlds keeps its promise of letting you play however you want by flattening the difference between skill sets and being unwilling to keep any of its content out of reach. While on rare occasions, being an expert hacker or inveterate liar might give you a slightly different way to complete a quest, the end result is almost always the same, and never once did I encounter an obstacle that I had to put off until I could level up or switch crewmates to complete. Most important locked computer terminals can also be opened with a passcode found conveniently nearby, and anything you gain by charming your way through a conversation can also be achieved through violence. Time after time, I used my Lockpick skill to break into an off-limits section of one or another practically identical compound only to find another unlocked door just feet away for anyone who hadn’t bothered to invest their skill points in skullduggery. And no matter what skills you invest in, there’s no avoiding the fact that combat is the most prevalent pillar of gameplay. You can be a sneaky, charismatic hacker if you want, but there’s no avoiding a lot of firefights along the way.Passing any skill check also gives you a shot of XP, which creates a weird feedback loop where the more you invest in these skills, the more skill points you end up getting. Between the bonuses I got from my companions and the fountains of XP shooting out of every locked door and secure computer, there was basically no skill check I couldn’t pass by the middle of the game. Rather than crafting a unique character with their own way of addressing Halcyon’s challenges, I wound up becoming a jack of all trades with more skills than I knew what to do with, and it felt more disappointing than empowering. Because The Outer Worlds seems to be built to let you pass any obstacle however you see fit, I was often arbitrarily choosing from three or four options with the exact same outcome. You could argue that it’s because of how I played: I could have ditched my companions, poured more points into my neglected combat skills, or kept some scores artificially low. Those are all options, but a skill system that you have to exploit to make yourself less powerful may just be a flawed system.If the ethos of The Outer Worlds’ skill system is to give you unlimited ways to solve the same problem, the ethos of its narrative is to give you unlimited paths to the same destination. In theory, you’re determining the course of the Halcyon colony, siding with the outlaw scientist Phineas Welles to awaken the inhabitants of the lost Hope or handing him over to the ruthless Board and helping them make the colony into the Ayn Rand theme park of their dreams. Along the way, you can side with different factions to chart the fates of Halcyon’s various settlements, but in practice, those choices don’t add up to much more than a blurb in the end-of-game wrap-up. Yes, you can decide who’s in charge of a handful of towns or just slaughter everyone in the colony, but you’ll still end up playing the same main missions and following the same general path. There is an impressive degree of flexibility to how the game adapts to your choices, letting you switch sides over and over with the relevant faction quests just getting slotted into place, but that’s enabled by a thin illusion of choice covering a very rigid narrative structure. Whether you broker peace in any given town or consign it to ruin, the story keeps chugging along, shuttling you onto the next location without so much as a look back at the planet whose fate you’ve just single handedly decided. You can often just kill your quest givers and take whatever you were hoping to gain from them without any real consequences except the ire of a faction you’ll never need to deal with again.It’s the colony that matters in The Outer Worlds, not the people in it, and that basically dooms its attempts at corporate satire from the start. The Board sees individual workers as drones that it is absolutely willing to kill to help the 1% live a little better for a little longer, but even the “heroic” ending doesn’t imbue them with any humanity, still considering Hope’s inhabitants valuable only by virtue of how they might help the colony survive. Your quest to awaken the colonists stuck in suspended animation on the Hope isn’t motivated by wanting to help them; it’s because the Hope is evidently some kind of honor student ark filled with Earth’s “best and brightest” who can put the failing colony back on track.The shaky premise that underpins The Outer Worlds sits on top of an uneven satire, which posits a space colony run by amoral corporations for the exclusive benefit of the rich without really having anything to say about it. Colonists are pressed into indentured servitude, devoting their lives to a corporation in exchange for the relative safety of living inside a walled city modeled after a 19th-century company town run with practically no oversight. The Outer Worlds’ attempts at satire build on that framework, drawing on some very real issues but treating them like punchlines in and of themselves. References to worker exploitation (up to and including workers being killed or dismembered), companies getting entire communities sick, and even parallels to corporate-backed paramilitary groups like the Pinkertons are used either as jokes or evidence of the evil of the game’s corporations, but The Outer Worlds refuses to examine any of it further, content to just display this depravity without further comment. If you choose to side with the Board, things get even darker, but the game seems to actually tone down its jabs when you take this path, painting the perpetrators of atrocities as somehow being forced into it — almost as if you’re expected to find them reasonable, if still unsympathetic. (This company only gives workers 10 minutes of break time for their birthdays; isn’t that funny? Anyway, go slaughter an entire town to save the Board on energy costs. Don’t worry; you’ll never have to interrogate that decision later.)As you would expect, plenty of people object to the Board’s rule, but The Outer Worlds pushes them to the margins almost as much as the corporations themselves do. Aside from universally aggressive marauders, the only real resistance to the corporations is limited to one isolated band of deserters and a quasi-religious group of revolutionaries living in the wilderness. Ever careful to avoid taking sides, The Outer Worlds goes out of its way to make the leaders of these groups seem dangerous, selfish, or hypocritical, and siding with them generally leads to worse outcomes than collaborating with the corporations. It all adds up to the bizarrely conservative notion that, while these corporations would literally kill to make a profit, they do provide stability, so who’s to say whether we’d really be better off without them? This strange ambivalence, the desire to paint those who oppose the game’s cartoonishly evil corporations as somehow suspect, shows up all over the place in The Outer Worlds. For instance, your most reasonable companions tend to be the most protective of the status quo, while the most radical is also kind of a starry-eyed airhead. One of the most telling details for me is the simple fact that corporate NPCs get names like “guard” and “worker,” while members of the anti-corporate Iconoclasts are called things like “rioter,” even if they’re doing nothing more than standing around a bar or doing clerical work.The Outer Worlds is so uninterested in commenting on its setting, it makes me wonder why it was chosen at all. Rather than say anything about unchecked corporatism, The Outer Worlds just portrays its excesses, seemingly hoping that players will draw their own conclusions even when it’s unwilling to do the same. Despite its confused, noncommittal story, The Outer Worlds features some great writing and memorable if underused characters. If you’re able to look past its ultimate shallowness and don’t demand much more from the game’s combat than what you’d get from a first-person Fallout game, The Outer Worlds may still satisfy your open-world RPG craving.For better or worse, The Outer Worlds is a perfectly middle-of-the-road open-world RPG. It doesn’t take any big risks, but that also keeps it from falling on its face. Despite some great writing, the game doesn’t have much to say about the corporate dystopia it establishes, ultimately playing it too safe to justify the premise.

The Outer Worlds,Steve Boxer,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/oct/24/the-outer-worlds-review-obsidan-entertainment,"PC, PS4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One; Obsidian EntertainmentMore than just Fallout in space, this action-RPG is a delightful sci-fi romp with razor-sharp writing, lashings of humour and enough content to entertain you for monthsSet in an unspecified future in which humankind has begun to colonise other planets, The Outer Worlds is easy to describe but in no way derivative. In essence, as a single-player, first-person action-RPG, it’s Fallout in space. There is a steampunk vibe, as well as art direction that harks back to 1950s sci-fi comics such as Dan Dare and The Eagle. But the look, feel and game world are distinctive and fully realised, and it addresses modern concerns, such as the disasters that happen when mega-corporations assume the role of governments.In the star system of Halcyon, the furthest colony from Earth, a giant ship called the Hope, packed with hundreds of thousands of colonists in suspended animation, has been abandoned in space for inexplicable bureaucratic reasons. Phineas Welles, a sort of dissident mad-scientist adventurer, locates it and wakes up one person on board: your character.In classic RPG fashion, you can decide which gender you want to be and allocate a bunch of skill points, before Welles whisks you off to a nearby planet where he has freelancer Captain Hawthorne standing by with a ship to help you. Unfortunately, Hawthorne proves not to be the brightest star in the galaxy and is crushed by your pod when it lands on his beacon. So you must work your way to his ship by performing helpful missions for the locals, before contacting Welles to find out what to do next.What ensues is a delightful sci-fi romp with razor-sharp writing, lashings of humour and immaculately observed characters that put most game franchises to shame. The gameplay is well crafted, too. Although its shooting engine – which provides an assortment of ever more exotic weaponry and features a time-slowing mechanic – does feel like Fallout, albeit simplified and honed, it is augmented by modding, skill and perk systems that avoid the baffling arcaneness that can afflict similarly ambitious RPGs.It’s not all just about shooting: you can employ stealth, often have to partake in mild puzzle-solving, and dialogue with other characters emerges as a key element. As you progress, you accumulate a band of assistants whose equipment and fighting styles you can influence, each of whom has some drama going on in which you can get involved, triggering stories that feel like mini-soap operas.Each of the planets in Halcyon is run by a different corporation – one churning out canned food, for example, and another meds – and you begin to encounter groups who have escaped the corporate yoke. All the planets, meanwhile, have a problem with aggressive outlaws and dangerous wildlife. Your overarching mission is to subvert the Board, which controls the various corporations and has clearly been running Halcyon into the ground, before reanimating the settlers on the Hope in the expectation that they will run Halcyon in a less venal, money-grabbing and authoritarian manner.Apart from the fabulous art and attention to detail in the myriad compelling missions (even the quests that stray into fetch-and-carry territory prove fun), what really marks out The Outer Worlds as a special experience is the way in which, right from the start, it somehow feels cosy, inviting and, despite its stylised air, curiously plausible. Its characters are so well-written that it’s easy to become emotionally involved with them, and the game plays on that by confronting you with occasional dilemmas.It’s huge and sprawling, with enough content to keep you immersed for weeks or even months, but it is also something of a holy grail for action-RPGs: although there is a complicated set of systems, with vast amounts of gear, armour and weaponry to loot, it is never complicated to play.The Outer Worlds is vital proof that mid-sized indie teams can take on the big guns at their own game, and leave them looking a little foolish. It provides the most enjoyable dose of escapism I have encountered this year."
The Outer Worlds,Jez Corden,Windows Central,https://www.windowscentral.com/outer-worlds-xbox-one-pc-review,"No offers foundWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.The Outer Worlds launches on October 25, 2019, and as I write this, I literally just got finished with the story.Set a few hundred years in the future, 10 Earth corporations pooled their resources and purchased an entire solar system, shipping out several colony ships with the aim of building up an all-new home away from Earth. As you might expect, things didn't exactly go to plan.The Outer Worlds is an utterly tremendous achievement that showcases the best of Obsidian's writing wit, world-building detail, and character focus. The game borrows heavily from other major beloved RPG franchises that have fallen out of favor with shareholders in recent years, which is perhaps ironic given the game's extreme-Capitalism plot beats. Obsidian fills that forgotten niche with confidence and rigor.Here's everything awesome (and not so awesome) about The Outer Worlds, the most exciting new IP in years.$60 (opens in new tab)Bottom line: While rough around the edges, The Outer Worlds journey across the stars is an instant-classic RPG fans cannot miss.Stunning world, combat, and charactersThe Outer Worlds feels like the culmination of years of Obsidian Entertainment experience with RPGs, from Knights of the Old Republic II to Fallout New Vegas. What the studio has put together here has some rough edges, but here's why I think it's the most exciting new IP in years.Bethesda and Bioware, known for games like Skyrim and Mass Effect often feel like they've taken a step back from the very idea of a single-player RPG, urged by shareholders to chase multiplayer cash cows. There's been a slight void in the market for an RPG on this level where your choices truly matter, and Obsidian is filling it with confidence and rigor.Set a few hundred years in the future, several corporations banded together and purchased the Halcyon solar system, shipping huge colony ships across the galaxy to reach it. As a member of one of the hitherto lost colony ships, The Hope, you're unceremoniously revived out of hibernation by what can only be described as a mad scientist, then dropped out of space on the surface of a colorful alien world. The opening is as hilarious as it is disorienting.Obsidian's writing shines through as The Outer World's best feature. From the most minor side quests to grand finales, Obsidian had me roiling in laughter, sickened with disgust, and perplexed by deep philosophical discussions between the game's surprisingly fleshed out fictional religions. Much of The Outer World's marketing has revolved around the game's humor, and of that there is plenty. It lures you into a false sense of security, however. Make no mistake, The Outer Worlds can get extremely dark, extremely fast. It'll sucker-punch you, and leave a lasting impression.The world-building is simply excellent here, with Obsidian really flexing its experience to build something that fans of Firefly and Cowboy Bebop will utterly adore. Halcyon's colonies are trapped in a capitalistic hell, where corporations literally rule.Indentured servitude has been religiousized, almost, as each colony you visit is besieged by various problems. Roaming deserters and marauders, hungry alien monsters, and worker droids gone haywire. You'll travel across various colonies in various states of disrepair, unlocking the secrets of the mysterious Halcyon Board that controls everything.The Outer Worlds marries shooter combat with RPG mechanics more elegantly than many other similar games.Along the way, you'll meet comrades and enlist them (or reject them) into your squad, making the journey all the more rewarding. SAM the repurposed sanitation droid that now spews acid, instead of soap, hell-bent on eliminating ""germs."" Ellie, the runaway-turned-pirate, and Vicar Max, who reads his enemies their last rites before shotgunning them in the face. Each companion has their own quests and quirks to solve, and will bicker and banter among themselves along the way.The Outer Worlds approach to combat has some rough edges (which I'll go over in the next section), but I'd argue that The Outer Worlds marries shooter combat with RPG mechanics more elegantly than many other similar games that have attempted it.As a side effect of the hibernation process, the player character perceives time a little differently. Time dilation allows you to slow down the action, and target specific body parts manually for different effects. Cripple legs to make enemies move slower, blind them with a headshot, or disarm them by shooting their hands. If you choose to roll with companions, they can provide tactical support with their unique abilities which charge on a cooldown. The SAM droid can use his rocket boosters to slam down on enemies, creating an area stun effect, for example. These abillities add some depth and tactical play to proceedings, which can be crucial on higher difficulties.Structurally, The Outer Worlds takes place across various wide open spaces. Monarch is by far the largest, complete with large city settlements, abandoned colonies and plains full of roaming monsters. Some of the side missions take place in smaller locales, which you can access via your personal ship — The Unreliable. You can skip a lot of the side missions and head straight to the end, but the game will be nowhere near as rich for those who rush. The epilogue guides you through the long-term effects of every decision you've made throughout the game, after all, so be sure to take your time.The Outer Worlds is the first shooter in what feels like an incredibly long time where your choices really matter. You can choose to persuade, intimidate, or lie your way to better rewards or new story paths, while betraying or supporting various factions. There are plenty of gray areas, morally, when it comes to your decisions, and your choices ultimately shape what sort of colony Halcyon will become.Obsidian's writing shines through as The Outer World's best feature.It's rare that I find myself longing for more after finishing a game nowadays, in an age of perpetual service-driven experiences. The Outer Worlds feels as old school as it comes in that respect. I adored every moment of my time in Halcyon, blasting bandits into bloody chunks, warping gravity with the game's unique ""Science"" weapons, and watching heads burst in slow motion.There is no question in my mind that The Outer Worlds represents an instant classic, but like many of those Xbox 360-era RPGs we remember fondly in 2019, there is quite a collection of annoyances worth addressing.UI, A.I., and physics odditiesI'm happy to to forgive The Outer Worlds for most of these, as reading my list of grievances in my notes feels like a list of nitpicks rather than genuine problems, particularly since most could easily be patched. The first entry in a new IP is always going to have pain points here and there, but The Outer Worlds has quite a few oddities that I hope Obsidian can address either in patches, or in future sequels (and oh my God, please make a sequel).Outside of conversation dialogue, The Outer Worlds' cities and townships can feel a little robotic. NPCs walk around and discuss your deeds and decisions, which is awesome. However, they only really stand around, feeling like props, rather than living entities. It undermine's the game's environmental design, which is otherwise staggeringly good.In terms of combat, many of The Outer Worlds' kill cameras just, fail, most of the time. Vicar Max's shotgun scenes are almost certain to drop the camera behind a rock or something, obscuring your view of the fun. It also doesn't help that companion abilities have this tendency to target friendly NPCs, unintentionally, which often comes with dire consequences.The enemy/companion A.I. isn't that great either, with NPCs generally running into the open, without any concept of taking cover or avoiding fire on the ground. You can, at least, control your own NPCs with handy commands, which elleviates some of these issues.Outside of conversation dialogue, The Outer Worlds' cities and townships can feel a little robotic.Some of the weapon's visual effects are far too large and bright at times, which betrays the whole point of having slow motion kills. If I can't see the effects of my slick slow motion skillz because they're hidden behind a gigantic red flash, what is the point? Also the gore mechanics feel quirky and inconsistent. Sometimes, a sniper shot to the chest has caused a target's arms and legs to fall off, which while hilarious at first, is a little bit odd considering that it can be rare, even with maxed out rifle skills, to produce a skull-popping headshot.The other annoyances pertain to the UI. Scrolling around the map on controller is painfully slow and sticky, and the fact you can't track multiple quests at once forces you into the menus far more often than I'd like. The Outer Worlds also suffers from what I'll call Prey Syndrome, where completing late-stage side quests requires you to fast travel around the entire system, with interim space trips, producing a parade of loading screens.The ability to stack quests would've helped with that sensation. I'm also not a huge fan of the game's medical inhaler, which serves as your primary method for health replenishment. The mechanic itself is great, but you have to constantly dive back into the menus to restock it with raw materials, which I feel could've been implemented without having to enter the main inventory screen to manage.None of these issues really hindered my enjoyment of the game, however. I didn't encounter any performance issues, bugs, or other system-level problems. Dare I say it, for the most part, Obsidian managed to build a polished game.The Outer Worlds is a tremendous RPG that feels like the culmination of Obsidian's efforts with similar franchises over the years. As a fan of classic Bioware and Bethesda RPGs, The Outer Worlds not only scratches the itch, but exceeds the legacy of the titles it draws inspiration from in some ways.With an intriguing world ripe for expansion, tight combat, and a meticulous focus on world-building, The Outer Worlds is an instant classic well worthy of any RPG fan's time.Instant classicMost-exciting new IP in yearsThe Outer Worlds is a little rough around the edges similar to its ragtag crew of heroes, but it's not for lack of heart and soul. The Outer Worlds is a tremendous journey across an entire star system RPG fans can't miss.Jez Corden a Managing Editor at Windows Central, focusing primarily on all things Xbox and gaming.

The Outer Worlds,Rhett Waselenchuk,COGconnected,https://cogconnected.com/review/outer-worlds-switch-review/,"Last year, Obsidian Entertainment burst back on to the scene with The Outer Worlds. It combined everything Obsidian had learned from developing Fallout: New Vegas, with exciting new ideas that included a setting based around a six-planet star system and deeper role-playing elements that fans of subsequent Fallout releases were missing. The Outer Worlds was a complete success, with many touting it as Obsidian’s most exceptional work to date. So it’s entirely regretful to have to be the bearer of bad news – but The Outer Worlds on the Nintendo Switch is another port in a long list of games that have no business being on this system.COGconnected’s own Alexander Thomas covered The Outer Worlds upon its initial release with an in-depth review that can get you up to speed on the intricacies of the game. I’d like to focus more on what you can expect from the technical side of the Switch version, but to quickly get you caught up if you’re unfamiliar, The Outer Worlds is set in 2355. You’re awoken on Halcyon’s outskirts, the previously mentioned six-planet star system, and are subsequently dragged into the conflict between the planets’ inhabitants, and ‘The Board.’ The Board is a collection of multi-mega corporations that control all aspects of civilian life. If you’ve played any of the modern Fallout games, you’ll feel right at home here. A vast world is at your fingertips, with rich, developed characters and missions aplenty for you to explore. Mix in a deep progression system featuring skills and perks that unlock with a relatively speedy consistency, as well as routinely having to make decisions that will come with life-or-death consequences. Putting all of this together, it’s hard to argue that this space-themed cocktail isn’t a noteworthy achievement for Obsidian Entertainment. But there’s nothing remarkable or noteworthy about The Outer Worlds on the Switch.Like so many games before it that have struggled to stand on their own two feet under the weight of the Nintendo Switch hardware limitations, The Outer Worlds, too, buckles to the pressure of it all. More frustrating than anything, I couldn’t find a single way to play the game that felt ‘right.’ In docked mode, character models while in a cutscene are entirely serviceable, but as soon as the game gets going, things fall apart. Visuals are completely washed out, with everything other than what’s closest to you, losing all texture and detail. It’s just too difficult, in 2020, to play a game on a 65” TV that the majority of the time looks as if it’s running through a fogged-up window. Typically, these AAA Switch ports tend to look better in handheld mode, as the smaller screen hides much of the lack of detail, but The Outer Worlds might be the worst example of this I’ve seen to date.Part of what made the original so fascinating to me was the beauty of the planets you would visit. Everything popped with fun, vibrant color, and it helped to keep the player anticipating what would come next. Flipping over to handheld mode while playing the game on the Switch has sucked that enjoyment and anticipation right out of me. I’m somebody that needs to explore every nook and cranny of games like this. My brain just won’t let me pass through an area unless I’m convinced I’ve discovered everything it has to offer. But it’s not like that with this game. I don’t want to explore anything, because it’s all just a blurry mess that, no matter how hard I try, I can’t get used to. The game looks terrible. Just like in docked mode, everything but the closest objects lose all detail as you move to and from them. Meaning the pop-in becomes horrific as you make your way through settlements and towns, and the objects that maintain their texture look about as good as a game from fifteen years ago.You would think that if such sacrifices have been made to the visuals, inevitably, the game would at least run smoothly. But more often than not, I would find the framerate rendering the game nearly unplayable. You’ll be fine enough moving about, getting from point A to point B, but as soon as any sort of action starts, it feels like it dips to below twenty frames per second. This makes it extremely difficult to play. Not only for the fact that as you progress further along and the missions become more intricate, with an increase in moving parts, the framerate gets worse and worse – this, of course, makes aiming in these situations a complete nightmare. But also, couple this with the Switch Joycons having some of the flimsiest, most imprecise sticks you’ll ever find on a controller, and just trying to score a kill can become an excruciating test of patience.With that all being said, I felt as if I was left with one option. Playing the game in tabletop mode, with a pro controller. Boy, that sure sounds fun, doesn’t it? You can imagine it isn’t exactly difficult for me not to recommend something that I believe works best only after jumping through a few hoops. Much like The Witcher 3, it’s undeniably impressive that the entire package is here, at the ready to be taken on the go. There’s a vast world under the hood, with a lot of missions and dialogue on file, but I think that lends more credence to the argument that this deserves to be experienced at its full potential. And you’ll never get that on the Switch.The Outer Worlds on the Nintendo Switch is the final straw for me. My heart can’t take the disappointment of these ports anymore. Time and time again, a port of an otherwise excellent game is released on the Switch (at full price, mind you) only to be a shell of the developer’s original vision. I get it, there’s money to be made, and there will always be that dedicated group of fans that can’t be told no, and will argue these games don’t look the way they do. But we all know that’s a joke. The Outer Worlds on the Switch looks bad, plays bad, and did nothing more than make me want to get the game elsewhere. I guess that’s a win for Obsidian.***Switch key provided by the publisher***Developer: Obsidian EntertainmentPublisher: Private Division"
The Outer Worlds,Randy Kalista,Gaming Nexus,https://www.gamingnexus.com/Article/6022/The-Outer-Worlds/,"You rarely hear the term “comfort food gaming” thrown around sports titles or annual shooters. But role-playing games fondly earn that title from their audience. Indeed, that’s what The Outer Worlds is: comfort food gaming. While it fills your plate with a lot of the best things to come out of video game RPGs of the last 10 years, sometimes between mouthfuls you’ll think to yourself, “We’re having this again?”Obsidian’s quirky brand of drama and comedy is in full effect, right from the character creation screen. You aren’t some tried-and-true sci-fi trope, like a colonist that survived their entire colony being wiped out, or a rugged individualist that somehow made it through space army school. In The Outer Worlds, your background is much less glamorous sounding in all the best ways. You were a janitor or a farmer, a food additive taster or sub sous chef. But that experience still contributes to your stats. Were you a tossball team mascot? Here’s an aptitude bonus to your Inspiration score. If you’d rather put a -3% on shock damage received, consider a former life as a wire spooler doing electrician work on construction sites. It’s all intentionally mundane. Can’t imagine Commander Shepard from Mass Effect touting those credentials. Yes, Obsidian, makers of Fallout: New Vegas, is definitely on brand. You can tell, again, from that character creation screen. That and the Christopher-Walken-as-Dr.-Emmet-Brown-from-Back-to-the-Future character.In this perfectly boring dystopia, corporations rule the solar system. It’s as if Walmart and Amazon and, I don’t know, Costco each became president of their own little planet, and everybody acts as if they’re all on the clock. At best, the average citizen detects the irony in their own voice as they cough up the company byline. At worst, they’re profiteering off the backs of distressed workers with an “it is what it is” resignation about life.Your a stranger ‘round these parts, having just been woken up out of cryostasis on a colony ship that’s been lost in space for decades. Just you. And now this Doc Brown character has got it in his noggin that you’re going to Judge Dredd these corporate overlords with your old school values that don’t give a rip about corporate values. Eat the rich!The environments are pretty, in that overbaked Unreal engine kind of way. The art style is less about creating unique-looking scenery and more about cramming the screen with as much stuff as humanly possible. The art style can be...offensive in that way. After being woken up, you’re welcomed to Edgewater, population: cynical. It’s a swampy town built strictly for corporations and corporate employees. The only environmental storytelling comes from advertisements, the guards take miserable breaks when they’re not harassing employees that are on their breaks. It’s a place where only the best employees receive health care in this meritocracy, but the doctors who treat the best employees can’t make the payments on their own future-grave rentals.For some reason, the Talk button is the same as the Pull Out Your Gun button, which is the same as the reload button. Which is the same as the open doors/operate elevators/pick up cans of tuna button. The gamepad controls are apparently a little slow on the uptick when it comes to context. For a role-playing game about witty dialogue options, it sure is trigger happy. Mouse and keyboard don’t have this problem. I’ll readily admit, the main story choices you’re asked to make aren’t always easy, and they start you off with a doozy. The brave part wasn’t making the choice I’d made. The brave part was going back to my employer and telling them why I just screwed them over. Whoever said, “Asking for forgiveness is easier than asking for permission,” doesn’t always make the most credible point here. You know when you’re watching a TV show and you realize that you don’t really like the TV show because you don’t really like the main character? Well, I was afraid--after making the first big decision in The Outer Worlds--that that had become my problem. I wasn’t sure I was a likeable main character anymore. One green-eyed, green-haired NPC named Esther Blaine made my gameplay morality very clear. She explained why I’d gone from my usual Lawful Neutral kind of playthrough to a more Chaotic Good playthrough. She simply said, “Sometimes you’ve gotta do the wrong thing for the right reasons.” The Outer Worlds makes me feel like I’m always doing the wrong thing. The mechanical nature of the game all slants on the very easy side of things. The looting is fast and furious. You carry bottomless loads of ammunition. You can get a perk letting you fast travel while overencumbered. There’s no end to the shortcuts handed to you if you dislike slow-burn role-playing games. This is one of the most action-oriented RPGs I’ve ever played; or one of the most RPG-oriented action games I’ve ever played. I can’t decide. The Outer Worlds are made up of the pulpiest science-fiction. Where geothermal plants sip lava through giant straws straight from volcanoes. The maps are intentionally small and entirely unconvincing from a world-building perspective. They only serve players that aren’t terribly interested in traversing maps in the first place. Exploration is rewarded cheaply, where a crate with a few items will be tucked behind this rock or that tree. The worlds feels un-lived in, I don’t care how many “Where do they poop?” toilets in people’s sleeping quarters.Too much of The Outer Worlds feels all too familiar and done-before. In 2009, this game would’ve blown my mind. In 2019, it feels too late to ride the diesel-punk gravy train, and too soon for a Throwback Thursday celebration of that aesthetic. Everywhere you go feels like a Firefly-BioShock high school reunion. It’s a land of comical violence, with every corpse missing entire limbs, swimming in clay-colored pools of their own blood and viscera. I liked how my ship’s computer would clue me in on two of my crewmates having an off-topic conversation, for instance, above the cargo bay. I head over, poke my head into the convo, and, most likely, put those two as my wingmen on my next mission together. Nothing made me pair those two together. But quiet storytime elements like those made it impossible not to pair them up. The next time I’d return to my ship, the ship’s A.I. would tell me about a different couple of teammates she happened to overhear talking. Then I’d walk to them, poke my head into the convo, be just as pleasantly surprised by their conversation, and then let them tag along during my next away mission. It was a great way to get me to mix and match my crew, while earning some Mass Effect-style get-to-know-you time in the process.Looting is lazy fun, if you don’t care what you’re getting, because it doesn’t often matter. If you’ve got the encumbrance to spare, then you just pick everything up. It’s Hoover looting. Ollie Ollie Toxifree, Ambidextrine, Tarmac and Cheese. It doesn’t matter. Bypass Shunts, Armor Parts, Mag-Picks? Pick it all up. Don’t even read what it is when you do it. There’s no need to finesse your way through the process. You’re basically just Pac-Man chomping up lines of loot dots. And that’s just fine, as long as you don’t spend too much time reading about it in the menus, menus which are as convoluted as navigating menus with a Pip-Boy in Fallout. The Outer Worlds is about labor issues: workers and their supervisors, supervisors and their managers, managers and their directors, directors and their owners. Boss fights are mostly just fights with people’s bosses. Worker reforms, right sizing, relocations, corporate loyalty--and the breaking down of those structures. The gameplay is fast, sometimes too fast. The art style is overly busy. The stories are pulpy and a couple of your companions are always worth talking to. Something tells me, though, that I will always be forgetting how good The Outer Worlds is.Obsidian set out to make a Fallout game, but didn’t think we’d mind if they actually made it a Firefly game along the way. So now we have an anti-capitalist Firefly mired in labor issues but elevated by rapidfire gunplay, peppered with chuckles from a tryhard sense of humor.

A memorable time in space.It's easy to compare The Outer Worlds to the Fallout series. The two share a lot in common: The Outer Worlds is a story-driven action role-playing game, complete with branching paths, companions, perks, the lot – and that's before mentioning the fact that developer Obsidian Entertainment previously made Fallout: New Vegas.But The Outer Worlds is a more focused package. Instead of one massive open world, the game is split into several smaller zones in space with your ship acting as the hub area. Each location is distinct visually and in personality as you travel across Halcyon, the solar system at the centre of the story, to stop (or help carry out) the schemes of the corporations running the settlements.At the start of the game, scientist Phineas Wells rescues your character from 70 years of cryosleep on your colony's ship, and wants your help to revive the thousands of others in hibernation.Halcyon is a capitalist's haven, where workers are exploited and treated inhumanely for profit, and your first pit stop – a town named Edgewater – paints that grim picture. The people in Edgewater are malnourished, with medicine only given to those deemed most able to contribute. The gravedigger is also looking for muscle to collect money from those who have yet to pay for their burial plots.Meanwhile, a group of deserters have managed to get away and form their own community. They ask for your assistance, although siding with them (if you choose to go down this route) will have ramifications for the workers who remain in Edgewater.There are difficult decisions to make, and the anti-capitalist tone of the game is commendably strong throughout. That said, while engaging most of the time, the execution isn't perfect. The capitalist setting is overly satirical in spots to the point where it can be hard to take some of the dialogue and quests seriously, robbing them of impact.In your time in Halcyon, there are numerous enemy encounters to fight through – against marauders, robots, beasts, and more. The combat starts off fairly dull but really comes into its own when your options fully open up through levelling, affording you the chance to mould the character's build to your liking.Spending points into skills unlocks significant effects, and there are more than 60 perks to choose from to support your playstyle. One major feature is Tactical Time Dilation (TTD), which briefly slows down time when used. TTD is very limited and doesn't give that much of an advantage during the early levels, but becomes incredibly powerful after investing in it and starting to unlock its true potential.Weapons and armour can also be outfitted with mods, bringing another layer of customisation. This includes damage types, which encourage you to have different weapons to deal with different enemies. Shock damage is effective on robots, for example.Some of the customisation applies to your companions as well, including managing their weapon loadouts and perks. There are six companions in total to recruit, although only two can accompany you at any one time.They add an additional layer to the combat, but what makes them stand out is that each companion is fleshed out with their own personality and backstory, not dissimilar to what you would expect in a Mass Effect game.Our favourite companion is Parvati Holcomb, a shy asexual mechanic who gets to know and grows closer to a female ship engineer. In her companion quests, she seeks your guidance and help in asking the engineer out, and the arc is very wholesome.If there's one other point to make, it's that The Outer Worlds is fairly low on risk and does not stray far from its Fallout DNA.That's not a bad thing in itself and likely won't bother a lot of people. It's difficult to avoid mentioning that mechanically speaking, this is a game that does feel familiar and lack in genuine surprises, although the distinct tone of the narrative as well as some of the writing and characters fortunately does help to mitigate that feeling.VerdictThe Outer Worlds is one of the most polished and best games of this type, undoubtedly helped by the smaller scope.Focusing and doubling down on the right areas while telling a story that often asks thought-provoking and difficult questions, the game provides a memorable time without overstaying its welcome.Version reviewed: PCTime spent: 25 hours.

The Outer Worlds,Dominic Preston,Tech Advisor,https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/games/the-outer-worlds-3698073/,"When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence.The Outer Worlds is essentially trying to appeal to a very specific niche, and you probably know if you’re in it. The good news is, it really does deliver on what it promises.
The writing is mostly sharp, even if the satire sometimes falls flat, and the relatively tight story leaves enough breathing room for expansive player choice and roleplaying while keeping things brief enough to make it easy to go back in a second time and see the game from another perspective.Obsidian Entertainment is best known for creating Fallout: New Vegas, widely considered one of the best games within the Fallout franchise. Now the developer is taking a turn at its own expansive, anarchic sci-fi RPG shooter in The Outer Worlds.This isn’t a Fallout game, but the DNA is clear. Only instead of a post-apocalyptic Earth it takes an arch-capitalistic space colony as its setting, leaning deeper into anti-corporate themes as it lets players build characters that let them navigate the world of Halcyon just about any way they please.The Outer Worlds is out now on PC, PS4, and Xbox One and Nintendo Switch. You can grab it right now from 
Amazon, or check our guide to 
where to buy the game to find out basically everywhere it’s for sale.The game see you step into the space boots of a colonist in the Halcyon system. You’re one of the inhabitants of the supposedly lost colony ship Hope, revived 70 years late to discover a solar system overrun by corporatism. It’s then up to you to decide whether to fight the man and bring the capitalist structure down, carve out your own niche as a freelancer for hire, or quash the various socialist and anarchist rebellions and prove yourself a company man and/or woman.At its core, this is a Fallout-esque game. It’s a first-person sci-fi RPG in which you’ll navigate the various planets of the Halcyon from behind the barrel of a gun. Shooting is central, but you can also talk, bribe, hack, and sneak your way through most of the problems that you’ll face, and there’s a heavy emphasis on the scope of player choice here.That’s clear from the get-go. Character creation not only gives you the requisite set of physical characteristics to tweak (not that you’ll see them often) but also a whole set of stats to dump points into. High points in stats give you extra bonuses and abilities, while skimping will give you disadvantages you’ll be stuck with the whole way through the game.You get to keep distributing points and perks – special buffs – throughout the game as you level, continuing to shape your character’s abilities and playstyle, with your gear and companions offering further buffs and debuffs. That really lets you lean into ranged weapons, melee fighting, hacking, charming, or intimidating as your go-to approach, or mix-and-match for a jack-of-all-trades.Plenty of games offer that sort of diversity in character building, but few do such a good job of following it through in-game. Most missions – especially the larger main story ones – give you a choice of different approaches to take, and I only rarely felt I had to compromise my personal vision of my character’s take on things to fit into one of the approved options.That inevitably means consequences abound. You can kill almost any NPC, and pick fights with every faction, which will quickly result in whole towns or corporations turning against you if you’re not careful – in turn closing off some narrative options, while perhaps opening up others. The main story runs to 30 hours or so, making it lengthy enough to feel fulfilling in its own right, but short enough to reward replayability.Roleplaying even extends to the combat. Not just in the sense that your stats dictate your approach to fight either – the game will dynamically offer you the chance to take on new faults based on how you play. I kept getting killed by robots, giving me the chance to become phobic of them, making me even worse at fighting robots – but in turn getting an extra perk point to give myself a buff elsewhere and let my character be shaped by her escapades.Combat itself is fine, but it’s definitely one of the game’s weaker links. Shooting feels OK, and there’s a decent amount of weapon variety, improved further by the chance to mod weapons in various ways and even switch them between various damage types. You can also slow down time temporarily to target specific body parts and trigger various effects, in a system that might as well be called definitely-not-VATS-please-don’t-sue-us.You can also be joined in fights by up to two companions, who you can direct with (very) basic commands and who will each have a special ability. These abilities are mostly just big damage attacks with a short cut scene you can’t skip, and you will get fed up of them, I promise.Really, the companions are more important to the game’s roleplaying side than its combat anyway. There are six, five of which bring their own companion quest line (one is more of a comedy character) and will offer their opinions on the game’s other moral dilemmas along the way.They’re thinly sketched by comparison to the Mass Effect series, but each has a strong sense of character and their own charms – though it’s the first two you’ll meet, the engineer Parvati and space vicar Max, that have the strongest arcs. There are no romance options, and not much scope to build your own relationship with them – romantic or otherwise – but it’s unexpectedly impactful getting the chance to confer with them on the game’s biggest decision points, and they actually offer more diverse and challenging viewpoints than the Andromeda’s crew ever did.Those big decisions are varied in themselves. Capitalism is obviously where the game’s writers have set their sights, but there’s more to it than just ‘corporations bad, unions good’. On one planet you’ll have to choose between supporting the well-meaning leader of a smaller company hoping to reform the Halcyon Board from the inside or a camp of deserters hoping to violently tear the whole system down, and in that and other quests it rarely feels like there are easy answers.It helps that the world itself looks gnarly in the best possible way. There’s always an element of detachment when a multi-million dollar game backed by a major publisher decides to skewer corporate interests, and while Obsidian doesn’t pull its punches there’s still a light touch, and the setting here is as gritty as it is tongue-in-cheek.Unexpectedly, it’s when the game takes itself seriously that the writing shines, and its more satirical side tends to fall flat. The early 20th century-style marketing materials and corporate slogans still feel too familiar in the wake of both the Fallout series and the BioShock games, and for all the jokes I’m not sure I ever actually laughed.On a sentence-to-sentence level the writing works though, and the wealth of memos, logs, and messages buried in terminals and files across the planets are usually worth reading. The main story is at its best early on when it’s a loose series of errands mostly designed to force you to explore, but once it hits its twist it barrels towards a conclusion in a way that can’t help but feel a little anticlimactic.That’s at least partly because it puts you off fully exploring Halcyon, which is mostly a joy to wander around. Each planet or area feels distinct, from the overrun wilds of Monarch to the glistening townhouses of Byzantium, with but one frustrating common element: they are overrun with the same pointless loot that clogs up every Bethesda game. It’s endless busywork that just bogs you down with inventory management for no good reason – though at least there’s no crafting to waste any more of your time.The Outer Worlds is essentially trying to appeal to a very specific niche, and you probably know if you’re in it. The good news is, it really does deliver on what it promises.The writing is mostly sharp, even if the satire sometimes falls flat, and the relatively tight story leaves enough breathing room for expansive player choice and roleplaying while keeping things brief enough to make it easy to go back in a second time and see the game from another perspective.The Fallout heritage is undeniable – it’s in the OTT looting, the overly cheery marketing messages, and that definitely-not-VATS attack system – but throwing in companions, changing the setting, and leaning further into the games’ roleplaying roots helps The Outer Worlds feel like a different beast to the official Fallout games coming from Bethesda.Tech Advisor's Deputy Editor, Dom covers everything that runs on electricity, from phones and laptops to wearables, audio, gaming, smart home, and streaming - plus he's a regular fixture on the Tech Advisor YouTube channel.Tech Advisor's Deputy Editor, Dom covers everything that runs on electricity, from phones and laptops to wearables, audio, gaming, smart home, and streaming - plus he's a regular fixture on the Tech Advisor YouTube channel.PhonesLaptopsTabletsWearable TechHome TechSecurityDigital Magazine - SubscribeNewsletters"
The Outer Worlds,Tim McDonald,PC Invasion,https://www.pcinvasion.com/the-outer-worlds-review-not-so-brave-new-worlds/,"I want to say something about The Outer Worlds right from the off: it’s a good game. It’s a flawed game, and one that lacks some inspiration, but it’s still a good game. When I’m complaining about the combat or the user interface, do bear that in mind.Also, I need to apologize because I’m going to endlessly compare The Outer Worlds to Bethesda’s Fallout games. In large part, that’s because it wears its inspirations from that series on its sleeve. Hell, it can be fairly accurately described as a far more constrained Fallout game with some ideas yanked out of BioWare’s digital melodramas.So yes, The Outer Worlds is good. Yes, it’s very Fallout. And yes, “but” is going to be added to a lot of sentences.The far future: where ads are even more in-your-face than now.One thing I absolutely can’t fault is the premise. In The Outer Worlds, you’re one of a slew of hapless colonists sent to a distant cluster. Unfortunately, something happened with your particular ship, and it turned up 70 years too late – and the now-established locals have no real idea how to revive you or any of the other thousands left in cryostasis. After that long in deep freeze, conventional revival techniques prove a bit liquefying.They also have no real desire to revive you. The colony has enough problems of its own, and more than that, it’s quite literally owned by corporations. The amount of red tape is staggering: eating the food of a rival company is a punishable offense, and even things like graves require regular rental payment. It’s no surprise that the shining jewel of this particular cluster – a place where the rich live in luxury and do very little of importance – is called Byzantium. It’s played for both horror and laughs: terrible things happen and the state of the colony is frankly abysmal, but it’s hard not to chuckle when you find a secret lab… which is emblazoned with a giant neon sign declaring it as a secret lab.In the middle of this bureaucratic clusterfuck, you get revived by the rogue (and very wanted) scientist, Phineas Welles. Congratulations: you’ve been conscripted on a mission to revive everyone else on the ship, and hopefully save the colony. If that’s what you want to do, anyway…Most dialogue options don’t really alter conversations, but it’s always nice to have “exasperated” as a choice.Thankfully, you’re not forced into this path. The Outer Worlds is very, very good at letting you act how you want and finding ways to keep the game going regardless. You can opt to betray Welles as soon as is humanly possible and start working for someone else instead. You can murder any NPC you like at any time — assuming you can reach them (Welles and a few others will, for most of the game, only talk to you remotely).For my second playthrough, I opted to viciously dispatch literally every living person I could find in the initial area of Emerald Vale. On the one hand, The Outer Worlds did make note of the deaths of the faction leaders and reacted to this accordingly in the future. On the other hand, it didn’t really register my horrible massacre. Bah.This hands-off approach works rather well, though, if you like to go off the rails. While my first playthrough was straight-laced, my second was full of ridiculous backstabbings, both literal and metaphorical. Aside from brutally destroying anybody because it seemed amusing, I’d accept quests, complete them, murder the quest-giver and swap sides, and… well, yes. And I’m faintly impressed that The Outer Worlds managed to keep up with my manic idiocy.This would be more impressive if I hadn’t fought quite a few of these things already.It has its limits, though. Playing as a low intelligence character gives you “Dumb” conversation options, but unlike older CRPGs where this would hugely limit your conversations, here it just occasionally gives you an extra dialogue option. You can mostly say the exact same things as “smart” characters, and even converse intelligently about science and medicine if you have those skills, and then throw in an idiotic option.In terms of actual gameplay, The Outer Worlds… well, it’s basically Bethesda’s Fallout, but the open world has been replaced with a host of smaller maps. No, really. If you’ve played Fallout 3, 4, or Obsidian’s own New Vegas, the gameplay will feel startlingly familiar. That’s true right down to having hundreds of things to pick up and then try to organize while struggling with a really, really irritating inventory UI. You even hold down Reload to holster your weapon.Tactical Time Dilation makes everything go all wibbly. It looks kinda neat in-game, but makes for dreadful screenshots.There are differences and improvements, but this still feels like Fallout 1.5. As an example: instead of VATS, you have Tactical Time Dilation, which lets you slow everything down and take careful aim at a body part of your choice. But here, the aim is manual. The plus side is that going for the head isn’t necessarily the best move: every extremity affects an enemy differently, and the effects even change based on your weapon. A headshot can blind an enemy, but smacking them in the torso with a giant hammer can knock them prone, leaving them defenseless against further attacks. The problem is that it doesn’t really feel like a blazing sci-fi gun battle. Most weapons lack heft and enemies don’t particularly react to being hit, so combat feels rather lackluster. A problem, as it’s what you’ll spend a lot of time doing.Bonus points go to the camouflage shroud, though, which lets you walk into restricted areas unnoticed. Each bit of movement drains it, and when it reaches rock bottom, the next person to spot you will interrogate you. I mean, you can always shoot your way through, but it’s a neat way of working around stealth sections by using careful movement and dialogue instead. (And stealth or gunplay are always options, of course.)There’s always some sort of crew interaction going on when you visit the Unreliable, and it takes a while before they repeat.In a more BioWare twist on things, you have a hub base: your ship, the Unreliable. Your companions gather here, and you can find them interacting with each other or go on their individual quests. A couple of these quests are lengthy, interesting, and excellent; the same goes for a couple of characters. Others, conversely, are practically cardboard cutouts with zero personality, featuring quests that are resolved almost immediately.You’ve got someone who is pretty much Kaylee Frye from Firefly, and she’s glorious. There’s a gun-slinging pirate doctor, who is equally glorious. Both have fun and interesting quests that shed some light on both them and the larger world. And then there’s… a sports-loving rebel who hates the governing Board. That’s close to his entire character arc. Um.Much as The Outer Worlds pushes these characters as very varied in combat, the truth is that they’re all fairly similar. There are some minor differences in health pools and they’ll give different buffs to your stats, but aside from a single special skill, you can otherwise outfit them with whatever you like and they’ll perform just about as well.One of the better improvements is in character creation and growth. Skills cap out at 100, and up until 50 every skill in a “set” gains points at the same time. If you’re focusing on ranged weapons, then handguns, long guns, and energy weapons will level up simultaneously until 50. This means you can bulk up your skills and spread things around quickly. With some very useful abilities (repairing gear in the field, selling items to vending machines) unlocking every 20 points, it borders on necessary. Not only that, but your ship has a handy respec machine tucked away, so you can switch things around should you decide your current build isn’t for you.The ludicrous limits of the corporations still amuse me.But for all of these welcome additions, there are plenty of times when The Outer Worlds feels like it either lacks ambition or needed a bit more time. Buildings and dungeons feel like prefabs; at best, they’re built out of identical rooms. Even some set-piece rooms – like a gory vivisection area you may wander into fairly early on – pop up again in later dungeons.Enemy types aren’t particularly broad, either. There are mutant ape enemies, mutant insect enemies, and mutant lizard enemies, with a few sub-types in each group. It’s not the most diverse or eclectic set of foes, and while a Mantiqueen is impressive the first time you see one, they quickly grow a bit stale.And then there are some subplots and hints at ulterior motives that go exactly nowhere. There are characters, like the companion mentioned above, that barely deserve to be called “characters.” And despite the efforts at revitalizing the combat with the Tactical Time Dilation gubbins, it still feels very much like Fallout; weapons often lack a feeling of impact or strength. It feels like you’re clicking and watching health bars go down rather than engaging in a frantic firefight.Add some Power Armor and this would be very Fallout.Which is why I’m so torn on The Outer Worlds. Some of this is perhaps just disappointment: I expect a lot from Obsidian because of just how bloody good they can be. There are bits of this that are, absolutely, as good as I expect – the critical path stretching to accommodate your silliest urges, for example. But I wish the combat was more exciting and that areas were more diverse. I wish there was a quest to rival Fallout: New Vegas‘ Beyond the Beef. I wish I could compare shop items to what I have equipped without memorizing the numbers, backing out of the shop, and going to my inventory. I wish my inventory wasn’t full of 30 kinds of cereal that have the same status boosts. I wish, I wish, I wish.Nonetheless, remember what I said at the start: The Outer Worlds is a good game. It’s an enjoyable, amusing, and regularly chaotic romp through a fascinating take on unchecked corporate rampancy. I just would’ve liked to have been able to describe large parts of the gameplay as “innovative” rather than “serviceable.”An enjoyable adventure, but one that hews a little too close to its FPS Fallout roots.About Us

The Outer Worlds,Eric Hauter,PlayStation Universe,https://www.psu.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-ps4-review/," Eric Hauter / October 22, 2019Fallout fans have long been vocally unhappy with the turns the franchise has taken. Fallout 4 failed to please a large sub-section of the community, and Fallout 76 caused something akin to an internet riot. After years without a satisfying Fallout game, Obsidian Entertainment is swooping in to the rescue. The Outer Worlds isn’t technically a Fallout game, but if you squint a little bit you could be forgiven for assuming it is. Obsidian’s latest title delivers a burst of sweet nostalgia and an exciting new game world, all at the same time.The Outer Worlds is a fantastic game; and, by all appearances, it was constructed specifically for Fallout fans and those who enjoyed Obsidian’s own Fallout: New Vegas. For all those that have been disappointed by the Fallout series and recent attempts at first-person RPG’s Obsidian has a present for you, and it is one of the best games of the year.The Outer Worlds gets the ball rolling, then gets out of its own way to let players explore its fascinating world. The setup for your adventure will feel like déjà vu to Fallout fans. A mysterious stranger is awakened after a long sleep and set free to explore a world that has dramatically changed during their slumber. However, instead of a nuclear war, this time it is corporate greed that has decimated the landscape.When the player character is first awakened, they are reasonably confused about their surroundings. Having been put in suspended animation aboard the interstellar passenger ship, The Hope, they expected to wake up to a life spent taming the rugged space frontier.But The Hope was lost in space for sixty or seventy years; so by the time the player character is rescued and revived by a mad-scientist-type character, the planets in The Outer Worlds have been somewhat settled and tamed. But for settled worlds, these planets are more unsettling than they first seem.Outposts are owned by various corporations – each greedier and more corrupt than the last. Residents are considered employees – but are really little more than expendable pieces of property – subject to brutal living conditions and uber-restrictive codes of conduct. As most settlements are now generations-old, residents have little life experience beyond rattling off slogans and jingles while being denied basic human rights.Into these settlements wanders the player character, completely unbound to any entity and able to cause a ruckus anywhere and everywhere. I don’t want to spoil the game with any specific plot lines, but each area has its own fascinating self-contained storyline which still ties into the over-arching narrative. Players can approach these settlements any way they wish – from allowing the status quo to continue undisturbed to completely disrupting the way they function.But beware of indulging your humanitarian instincts. It is best to think hard before “freeing” anyone from their bondage,” as the corporations offer the only real structure these people have ever known. Many don’t take kindly to your tearing them down.The freedom to make or break these settlements (and individuals within them) is something that has been done in many games, but The Outer Worlds does it better than any I have ever seen. The game reacts to your choices in a manner that feels organic. When you see the results of an earlier decision reappear hours later, it is a fun surprise, but it never feels calculated or “gamey.”With The Outer Worlds, Obsidian has managed to create a fresh, new universe while still maintaining the absurdist art-deco-retro-sci-fi world-building that fans love so much. To be clear, The Outer Worlds’ universe isn’t a Fallout knock-off, but it shares enough DNA that fans will immediately feel a sense of warm familiarity wash over them. The overall effect is wildly entertaining.Each of the settlements (and many of the spaceships) are set up like a mini-open world. There is plenty of room surrounding base cities to wander around and discover fun creatures and explore abandoned settlements. Even though quests send you to each area’s high points, it is still entertaining to strike out on your own to go explore. Despite each area having its own map and the game not being one big open world, it feels open enough that you will likely not notice. The Outer Worlds does not suffer from a lack of content.Travel between planets and outposts (there are sometimes more than one on each planet) is handled via a fast-travel system housed on the player’s personal spaceship, The Unreliable. You simply tell the ship where you want to go, then disembark at your new location. This manner of travel is convenient, and it works well within the game’s established universe.You can expect to do a lot of bouncing between planets as a solar system full of settlements slowly opens up. Beginning quests keep you on the first planet while you get your feet wet, but before long you will be flying all over the system on various entertaining missions. I would typically scan my quest journal for multiple things I needed to accomplish at a location before setting out. There is a ton to do and see in each world.I have long been astounded that beyond Fallout and The Elder Scrolls, there aren’t many first-person RPGs on the market. It is clear that these games are difficult to make, but the genre is so beloved that it is striking that not more developers have had a try at it. That said, we now have a new franchise that can stand tall with those Bethesda stalwarts.There is no question that The Outer Worlds is closely modeled after Fallout. How closely? Well…very closely. Companions stop you short and ask “Can we talk?” Crazy powerful weapons are found laying unobtrusively in side rooms of sprawling bureaucratic structures. Terminals deliver wickedly funny backstories for those that take the time to read them. Hilarious and ironic propaganda posters litter the landscape. The Outer Worlds feels, looks, and behaves like an awesome Fallout game.That said, Obsidian took the time to make some improvements to the formula. Instead of irritating everyone with a minigame, lockpicking is now handled with the press of a button. The perk system is clearly laid out, allowing for planning. Respecs are available right on your ship (for a price). Tutorials pop up contextually throughout the game – as you run into stuff, the game explains what it is and how it works.But the biggest and most glorious improvement with The Outer Worlds is how polished it is. The bugs and glitches that plague the Fallout games are barely present here, if present at all. I’m sure there are some – games this size don’t get released without some issues eventually emerging. But in my playthrough, I never once experienced an issue. None. The closest thing I saw to a bug was one of my companions’ helmet loading in a little slow during a cutscene. If that’s the biggest technical issue I spotted, I would call The Outer Worlds a raging success.It is possible to resolve many quests without killing. With several different verbal options available, I often took the peaceful way out of conflicts when ever it was a option. Intimidation is my favorite way to push NPCs to do my bidding, but persuasion and outright lying are also effective ways to get what you want in The Outer WorldsIf you are the sort that needs to go all death/murder/kill on outposts, The Outer Worlds will allow you to do so. But even in the first outpost’s Megaton-style quandary, it is possible to completely screw over the settlement without killing everyone. I walked away from the first settlement I encountered both revered and feared, which was a deeply satisfying state to be in. The citizens were really pissed off and bewildered by my actions, but I still got great prices at local shops.Regardless of how conscientious you are, there are still critters and marauders in The Outer Worlds, and you are going to have to take some out. The combat in The Outer Worlds feels rich and rewarding, making cleansing the frontier a pleasure.You can equip up to four weapons, and cycle through them with a press of the Triangle button. I typically kept a couple of ranged weapons, a handgun and a melee weapon on hand. Weapons can be modded in a number of ways to make them more powerful, including the ability to add elemental damage.The weapons in The Outer Worlds handle well and are fun to use. Enemies aren’t particularly bright in The Outer Worlds, mostly either making a beeline for the player or hiding. This makes it fairly simple to mow them down with a flamethrower, but you might occasionally find yourself chasing someone over hill and dale, or getting surrounded when you accidentally trigger an entire town of marauders and space dogs. Killing enemies delivers a sizable burst of experience, which makes combat feel rewarding and worth engaging with.The Outer Worlds’ version of VATS is known as Time Dilation. A click of the R1 button will slow combat to a crawl for a few seconds, allowing the player to get in a few good shots before the flow of time resumes and the enemy charges in. Though this ability isn’t super useful at the beginning of the game, adding a few perks to it boosts it later on. Still, it is just as exciting to ignore Time Dilation completely and play The Outer Worlds as a straight shooter. This is the best combat I’ve seen in a first person RPG.There are so many great features in The Outer Worlds, more than I can cover in this review. The characters are well drawn and funny as hell, brought to life by some of the best voice acting I’ve heard in ages. The visuals – while not the most modern – still manage to deliver a sense of wonder and beauty. The absurdest dystopian humor is spot on, and delivers some great laughs on a regular basis.As a longtime Fallout (and Elder Scrolls) fan, as well as a fan of Obsidian’s isometric RPGs, this game resonated with me like few others I’ve played. This is a game for fans like me, fans of the Fallout franchise, fans of first-person RPG’s, and if you count yourself among our number, The Outer Worlds is a must-play. If you weren’t previously a fan of the genre, or you were thinking about checking it out, I can think of no better introduction to this genre.Obsidian set out to create a new universe and apply proven game concepts to it and they succeeded wildly.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPbrKXda6RIThe Outer Worlds releases for PS4, Xbox One, and PC on October 25, 2019.Review copy kindly provided by publisher.With a startlingly original new world to play in – combined with a warm feeling of familiarity – Obsidian has managed to deliver the one of the best first-person RPG's.

More specifically, Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas, the latter being developer Obsidian's own creation. You travel between disgruntled communities, picking up quests and shooting people you don't like. You click your way through branching dialogue options, and the camera zooms in on a character's mug whenever you initiate a conversation. At times it's eerily similar to the popular post-apocalyptic property, but as a pure role-playing experience, it has Bethesda well and truly beaten.Obsidian has proven itself a master of player choice, and The Outer Worlds is perhaps one of its finest works. As was the case with the aforementioned Fallout: New Vegas, the freedom that you're given in the way that you can approach quests, deal with people, and build your character, is pretty much unrivalled. The result is a title that is consistently engaging, surprising, and rewarding, regardless of how you choose to play.Taking place across a space colony known as Halcyon, your custom character is awakened from stasis a whole 70 years after your ship -- conveniently named The Hope -- should have arrived at its destination. You see, Halcyon isn't doing too well. Food shortages and plague outbreaks mean that some communities are barely hanging on, while governing bodies struggle to maintain law and order as situations grow more dire by the day.Coaxed out of cryosleep by an unhinged scientist named Phineas Welles, he reckons Halcyon's doomed unless you can help him resurrect everyone else who's still sleeping on The Hope -- some of the best and brightest minds that Earth ever sent off into space. What follows is a planet-hopping adventure that sees you bring peace or complete and utter chaos to the colony. The choice is yours.There are factions to side with, characters to lean on, and societal scandals to uncover. You can spend hours helping people out and making friends, or you can just step off your ship and start popping heads with your favourite revolver until you find some answers. The beauty of The Outer Worlds is that you're never out of options. Say you need information from someone, but even your silver tongue can't convince them to part with it. You could try lockpicking your way into their backroom and rummaging through their files -- but what if your lockpicking skill isn't high enough? Maybe you'll have to settle for doing them a favour or, y'know, you could just brutally murder them and loot their corpse.Quests can change dramatically depending on your actions, and your alignment with each faction can fluctuate significantly if you adopt a more, ahem, extreme approach to problem solving. There's no doubt that you can weave a tangled web throughout Halcyon, but again, it never feels like you're punished for doing things your way. Sure, siding with those guys might have been easier, and it might have netted you shiny new amour, but you would have missed out on some hair-raising shootouts and a slew of deliciously dark dialogue options.Speaking of which, The Outer Worlds has some of our favourite ever dialogue options in a video game -- and that's not something we say lightly. Your character isn't voiced, but this gives way to some brilliantly written and often genuinely funny responses. You can be the most snarky smart-arse that the galaxy has ever seen, or you can just straight up lie to people on a constant basis. You can obviously be a nice guy as well, but where's the fun in that? Dialogue choices are presented to you after almost every line of speech, and it's this immediate back and forth that makes every conversation thoroughly engaging, all while allowing you to shape your character's personality. It's top tier role-playing.Of course, it's not just you that has to deal with the people of Halcyon. You can recruit six different party members as you go about your business, each of them with their own outlook and moral standings. It's with these allies that The Outer Worlds starts to look a bit like Mass Effect as they each find a home on your ship, which is comically named The Unreliable. While your pals aren't quite as memorable as Garrus or Wrex, they're all interesting, nuanced, and brought to life by some great voice acting. And yes, they even get their own loyalty missions.As hinted, these missions will see you travel all across Halcyon. The game's not open world, but it does feature a number of spacious locations that you're free to explore. Between large cities and dangerous wilderness, environments feel distinct and well realised, even if they come off as somewhat static when compared to the open worlds that we've grown used to seeing this console generation.Okay, so we've got a great cast of characters and a twisting, turning story that branches off in countless different directions based on your actions -- but what about combat? Well, we're happy to report that the gunplay here is leagues ahead of what Fallout 4 has to offer, even if it doesn't measure up to the more focused first-person shooters on the market. It's actually quite twitchy, and movement is smooth. Some weapons have a better kick to them than others -- the revolvers feel great, for example -- but overall, it's rock solid action.Combat's elevated by TTD, or Tactical Time Dilation. It's essentially The Outer World's version of V.A.T.S., letting you slow time to a crawl as you assess your enemies and pick your shots. However, attacks made while using TTD aren't automatic -- you still have to move, aim, and pull the trigger. As such, it's a more versatile mechanic than Fallout's alternative, since you can slow time to move away from incoming assaults, or reposition yourself if you're caught out in the open. TTD doesn't last long unless you're standing very still, but it recharges quite quickly, allowing you to punctuate each skirmish with some stylish kills.Unfortunately, melee combat doesn't fare so well. Attacks made with blades and blunt instruments tend to lack a little bit of impact. It's not a deal breaker -- going melee is great fun once you're used to blocking and dodging -- but it doesn't feel as satisfying as capping your foes with your favourite rifle.Now, we know what you're thinking. Obsidian's got a bit of a reputation when it comes to buggy games, but you may be surprised to hear that The Outer Worlds is basically bug-free, at least in our experience. Aside from that one time where a party member just... Died for no discernible reason and we had to reload our save, we didn't come across a single issue in our 40 hours with the release. It also runs well on PlayStation 4 Pro, the framerate sticking to a consistent 30 frames-per-second outside of some very minor stutters when it's busy autosaving. When it comes to performance, our only real complaint is that load screens can be lengthy -- some of them breaking the one minute mark if you're entering a particularly dense area.Moving on, The Outer Worlds isn't a much of a looker, despite some lovely skyboxes and good art direction. Some textures are pretty darn muddy, and some characters are pretty darn ugly. That said, the facial animations aren't bad at all. They're certainly not inline with the best in the business, but much like The Witcher 3, the game makes great use of decent stock animations to get the job done.Before we head over to the conclusion, it's worth noting that The Outer Worlds isn't a particularly long game. You could probably blitz the main story in 15 hours or so, but you'd be missing out on some great optional quests. A full run bumps your playtime up to 30 hours or thereabouts, and honestly, it's quite refreshing not to have to spend 100 hours digging through a gigantic RPG. What's more, at 30 hours a pop -- likely much less on additional playthroughs -- The Outer Worlds has a massive amount of replay potential.The Outer Worlds is a role-playing triumph. With its sights set squarely on player choice, Obsidian delivers a brilliantly crafted sci-fi adventure that's packed with witty writing, great characters, and a fantastic degree of freedom. Add solid combat and rewarding exploration to the mix, and you've got the recipe for an RPG that begs to replayed time and time again.

When he's not practising combos, he's usually getting lost in the latest 100-hour RPG, or, y'know, replaying The Witcher 3.Comments (56)Any questions, let me know!@ShogunRokWell looks like I'll be buying this, nice review btw.Will you be doing an update once you have the day one patch too? I imagine it'll be the loading times that are targeted first hopefully.100% getting. Not sure if PS4 or Game Pass yet tho...@ShogunRok is the game double dip worthy? I want to wait for the switch port next year but also can’t wait to play it, seeing how it has so much replay value, would it be worth it to buy on ps4 right now and, assuming the port will be as good, buy it again in a few months and replay it with different choises?@Futureshark Yeah, we'll do an article on the patch if it makes any significant changes.YES!!! I'm so happy this game is not just hype and is definitely something I'm genuinely looking forward too now@darkswabber I think it could be, yeah. I think it might actually be a decent fit for handheld play. I'd check out some gameplay, read all the reviews, and then decide if you want to buy it now. If you do, then it's just a case of seeing how much you enjoy it.Fantastic! Will pick up. It's funny that the dead companion bug happened to the Kotaku reviewer as well. Sounds like a hot fix is needed.It's gonna be dope!
So glad I canceled, uncanceled, ununcanceled, and then pre-ordered my pre-order for this game!First person only you say?Pre-order canceled!Can't wait to play it! HahaI very much prefer a voiced character over a mute but saying that, some of the dialogue choices in New Vegas had me in stitches.Good to know that it's relatively bug free too. I'm defo buying this.I feel like im coming down with something fridayNice, I already have it on pc gamepass, can’t wait to try it great review! (see bethesda this is what fallout 76 should have been)but i'll be the guy that just HAS to ask this in any review,how does this run on the base ps4?(something all reviews of any game should mention whenever possible tbh)@Deadhunter Really? That's pretty funny. I was just going about my business on my ship and my companion's quest suddenly failed. I checked my quest log and it said that they were dead. Incredibly weird, but thankfully my game had autosaved just a few minutes back and it never happened again.Great review and this man knows his rpgs so I really can't wait until Friday now. This sounds exactly like the game I've been waiting for since New Vegas, a proper rpg with real customisation making a genuine difference to your game experience 😁""It's quite refreshing not to have to spend 100 hours digging through a gigantic RPG.""PREACH!I wasn't interested in getting this, but after reading the review, I may have to get it after all.@Deadlyblack snap I was thinking this game could go either way but glad it's gone the right way I'm going to see the sacrifices made on the switch port first, but I'll probably be picking this up down the line!Great and love the shorter run time. Will get to this after Assassin' Creed Odyssey and Afterparty (when that hits).Quite hyped for this one, I'm going to wait and see if the Switch port is going to be passable but if that bombs then I'm glad that I always have my PS4 to fall back on.Whaaaat? 9/10 ok now I'm interested!If anyone has been disappointed by recent Fallout games then I hope The Outer Worlds makes up for it.I'd admittedly kinda forgot about this til that ps4 pro malarky (That turned out to be fine) article... Looks like I'll have to keep my eye on this!Baaaah!!!So much good stuff is coming out right now I'm spoilt for choice! I cannot wait to get this feels like a long time since I played a really good rpg with real role playing were decisions actually affect the world.My comments elsewhere (about your ""guide"" for this game) not withstanding, excellent review.I would, though, like to see performance on base PS4 at least touched upon in all reviews going forward, until PS5 drops next year. Surely the majority of your readers are playing on the base system, based on sales figures between base/Pro..? Most reviews here seem to be based on the Pro.@Loki7T1 Me again  It's unlikely they can issue each reviewer with 2 PS4s, and where necessary a 4k TV. I believe at least one of the regular reviewers plays on a base PS4.I reckon Digital Foundry have that area covered so well, it's not even worth other sites touching on it to be honest. Unless performance on the base console is widely known to be different, in which case they can (and probably do) touch on it.Can’t wait to play this@Splat With Modern Warfare releasing the same day I will be getting it on Game Pass myself.I already have this installed on my XB1 thanks to game pass. I really want to play this launch day, but as usual my nemesis - time - says not likely matey! And I always feel guilty if I ditch another game I’m currently playing just to play a newer one! 🙄Yes, I'm glad it got nice reviews. Can't wait to be the boring nice guy once again 😁Another game I need to buy (wallet crying out loud on the floor in the background)Sounds like it's a lot of fun. Still, what with this, Death Stranding and Fallen Order out this year something's got to give.Maybe pick this up in the New Year.How is the PS4 framerate? Is it a stable 30 even at 4k for PS4 pro? I'm sensitive to frame rate fluctuations which is why I ask@holbroal Framerate's very solid on PS4 Pro. It does have some very slight dips but they're rare, and there are some stutters when the game autosaves, but that's it.Thanks for the info!Nice too hear its great but backlog so next year we will get it. 😁Nah I'll have to wait for Kojima's strange thing and the Star Wars something something reviews first.@ShogunRok How is the skill system? Is it varied enough to make you feel like you are playing a different character on a second play through? Like playing a warrior one time and a mage the next in other rpgs.@Gumbopudding Quite broad, and you only get enough skill points to properly specialise in two or three areas. Using guns is a lot different to using melee weapons, and having high dialogue stats can lead to totally different quest outcomes.I'd say specialising in different areas can make gameplay feel a lot different, even when it's something as small as having enough lockpicking skill to rob everyone blind.Trails of Cold Steel 3 and Outer Worlds... It is RPG heaven on PS4 regardless how you like them 😀I'll do this one on PC game Pass with this months $5 subscription. Already paying for Cold Steel 3 and Death Standing is just around the corner on PS4.You know, I’ve been teetering back and forth about this title since it was announced, but this review pushed me in the direction of a purchase. Sounds like a phenomenal RPG.I wouldn't even waste a dollar on game pass for this.@ShogunRok it all looks so bright and goofy, are there darker more twisted times to be had? Or is it all very comic booky?? If ya know what i mean@Gmork___ It does look quite colourful and bright, but that's not really the tone of the game. It's mostly all about dark comedy, very much in Obsidian's typical writing style (if you've played New Vegas you'll be right at home). Hopefully that answers your question!@ShogunRok Yep absolutely. I kinda figured. I played a disgusting TONNE of new vegas. Though that amount of primary colors makes me want to puke im sure ill love it anyway. Probably a day 1 for me.Is there any news about DLC planned for the game and would the PS4 get it now that M$ own Obsidian?Man, I wasn’t really all that excited about this game but now I’m considering it. Probably not right away since we have Death Stranding and Fallen Order around the corner but it looks like a good one to grab on sale in about 6 months. As well received as New Vegas was, I seem to recall it dropping in price pretty quickly.@Loki7T1 This is a problem for most review sites now who only consider the PS4 Pro despite the majority of players on base PS4. It would like to see the whole user base considered by at least comparing the performance/visuals of the two versions. As it stands, we rely on Digital Foundry which certainly can't cover all games.Damn, another game I'm going to have to buy...Great stuff, ordered it just now@LemonHaze No, I don't believe it does. The only PS4 Pro enhancement it has is a slightly boosted resolution.@darksoul77 Worth playing Divinity Original Sin 2.. available day one on XBox Game Pass... unbeatable value... installing it now..Ill do my very best to resist and wait for the switch versionI'm still on the first planet but it's great so far. I've already spoken to many interesting, well written and well acted characters. Cracking stuff.
