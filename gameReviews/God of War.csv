Link Official site (opens in new tab)God of War is a PC game. That still felt weird to say as I wrapped up my second playthrough over the holidays. Not far above it on my Steam library sits another game that is ""of War"" for a different master—Gears 5 (opens in new tab). Just a few years ago, these two tentpole series existing on the same device was impossible. Now they share a virtual shelf.Sony's latest angry dad game is evidence that the PC is the ultimate videogame unifier, and a great reminder of how the platform can bring out the best in games. I've killed my way across Midgard at 30 fps on a PS4 and 4K on PS5, but I don't think I can go back to either after 24 hours of buttery smooth monster chopping at 90+ fps. This is a damn good port, at least on my higher-end PC.If you skipped God of War 2018 or haven't touched the series at all, this is the God of War to play. All you need to know going in is that Kratos was Athena's best murder man until he was betrayed and decided to kill all of the gods (including his daddy, Zeus). This soft reboot picks up years later. In that time, Kratos left a now-godless Greece and wandered into the Norse lands, where he gained a wife (who has just passed away at the start of the game), a son named Atreus, and a glorious beard.God of War is its restraint. It's a small story in a world of gigantic characters. Kratos and Atreus aren't out to save the world—they just want to spread their wife/mother's ashes on a big mountain. They're not looking for a fight, but end up walking into a bunch of them because, apparently, Midgard has been a nightmare land of evil trolls, poison witches, and zombies for the last century or so. Much of the game is basically carving a path through this broken world, unraveling the petty god drama that led to its ruin.There's a lot of The Last of Us and Uncharted in its puzzly moments—hoisting young Atreus up a ledge to kick down a rope and jostling dilapidated supports to make a bridge are pages straight out of the Naughty Dog playbook—but these familiar puzzles get to have a lot of fun with Kratos' superhuman strength.My strongest memories all revolve around one of the greatest weapons in videogames: the Leviathan Axe.It's both cool and funny how often Atreus ponders how they're going to cross a gap just as Kratos lifts a beam the size of six cars or spins an entire building like it's a windup toy. Where Nathan Drake looks for a chain to lift an ancient pulley, Kratos simply throws his axe at the gears so hard that they spin. For a character that used to mostly show his toughness by killing every living thing in the room, it's nice to see Kratos throw his weight around the world itself. Lifting big rocks wouldn't be near as fun without the back and forth banter with Atreus (or as he's often called, ""boy""). It's not exactly a new narrative trick to pair a strong silent type with an inquisitive youngster, but unlike the developing relationship of Joel and Ellie, Atreus and Kratos already have a layered rapport that's steadily peeled back over time. It's obvious from the jump that the two aren't close. Atreus is determined to prove he's ready to make the journey and pressured to live up to Kratos' high standards (""Do not be sorry. Be better,"" Kratos tells him after taking a careless shot at a deer). Kratos, meanwhile, is an emotionally distant father who projects his own issues on other people.Their relationship evolves organically as they take on the world together, but Sony Santa Monica was smart to let side characters do some heavy lifting as well. One character introduced halfway through is easily the best part of the game, a wise old grandpa figure brimming with useful advice and stories to fill the dead air while the trio boat around Midgard.For as good as God of War's characters and stories are, my strongest memories all revolve around one of the greatest weapons in videogames: the Leviathan Axe. The axe is your primary weapon and do-it-all multitool throughout the entire game. It can pry open doors, destroy obstacles, freeze machinery in place, or be thrown the length of a football field to nab hard-to-reach loot. In combat, the Leviathan is a gratifying balance of heft and speed that hits a lot harder than Kratos' old Blades of Chaos. Here, again, Sony Santa Monica leverages Kratos' supernatural might to let you do impossible things with an axe, like cleave three enemies in half with a single move.Then there's the Leviathan's other perk. You've probably seen cool gifs of Kratos throwing the axe at a draugr and recalling it back to his hand like Thor's Mjölnir hammer. It feels just as cool as it looks and doesn't stop being cool for dozens of hours. Axe combat translates surprisingly well to keyboard and mouse, too: left and right mouse are standard attacks and you have to hold Ctrl to ready a throw. It was a good sign for God of War's default keybindings when I instinctually called back the axe by pressing the standard R reload key and it totally worked. That said, reaching for Ctrl might become a nuisance after a while if you don't have pinkies of steel. You can chuck the axe like a boomerang for a quick attack that bounces off enemies or throw it overhead for a harder hit that sticks and freezes them in place. It often made sense for me to leave that pinned enemy in place, because axe-less Kratos can still fight with his two meaty fists.Because nothing in God of War goes to waste, unarmed combat is an entirely different beast with its own skill tree and advantages. Blunt blows don’t deal as much damage as the axe, but they do fill enemy stagger meters super fast. Once fully staggered, Kratos can seal the deal with an instant execution straight out of Doomguy's library of glory kills. These spectacle kills are so satisfying that I was constantly looking for an excuse to lose the axe and go full boxer. Backing up Kratos at all times is Atreus, who has a dedicated button to command him to shoot arrows at whoever you're targeting. This on-the-fly weapon swapping creates fun improvisational brawls that compliment every fighting style. I can keep spamming light attack, or I could go full galaxy brain by pinning the biggest guy in place with the axe, beating fodder zombies to a pulp, and recalling the axe at just the right angle to slice through an enemy on the way back. When the stars align, I'm chaining moves in a literal combat loop. Everything matters at the same time, even if I could one-trick with the axe through most of the game.You get more cool stuff as the story progresses that you're best off seeing yourself, so much that I was a little overwhelmed by choice in the back half of the game. I tried hard to make the most out of every awesome way I have to kill stuff and yet Atreus would still berate me for not asking him to shoot arrows enough. I'm sorry kid, I just get carried away with axe headshots and forget about your wimpy arrows sometimes.Nvidia's upscaling tech has gotten so good I'm not sure why you'd ever flip it off when it's available.My second God of War playthrough was my best playthrough, and it had everything to do with the higher framerate I enjoyed with this PC port. Like Days Gone and Horizon: Zero Dawn before it, God of War flies on a good PC. On an RTX 3060 at 1920x1080, I was able to crank up the target fps to 90 and mostly stay there with Nvidia DLSS set to Quality. I noticed things got a little choppier during doorway transitions to the open-world lake area, but the frames would steady after a while. God of War also runs fine without DLSS, though at this point, Nvidia's upscaling tech has gotten so good I'm not sure why you'd ever flip it off when it's available. Little issues that plagued earlier versions of DLSS (like that weird ghosting effect you'd see on the small floating particles) are cleaned up nowadays, and what's left is an AI-assisted upscaled image that I can hardly discern from a native 1080p image. The magic trick may be a little less convincing if you scale it down to Balanced or Ultra Performance, but Quality is a safe bet for 1080p gaming. As for 1440p or 4K, I'm unfortunately ill-equipped to give it a go.DLSS isn't the only flavor or upscaling supported by God of War, either. You can alternatively flip on AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution. I don't have as much experience with this one, but I noticed a bit more blurriness when set to quality. It's still good, and as a frame-hungry PC gamer, I'd keep it on if it was my only choice.I also fiddled with individual graphics options here and there, of which God of War has several but not everything you could ask for, though I was satisfied with the game's simple presets. The game defaults to the curiously named ""Original"" preset (which I assume means the original PS4 look). I played mostly on Original and it looked great throughout, but I did notice sharper textures and post-processing on High and Ultra. My Kratos looks so good I can just about reach out and touch his wrinkly face.It's exciting to think about what God of War's landing on PC could mean for the console exclusive status quo. Sony has a dedicated PC publishing label (opens in new tab) now. As the company gets more serious about PC ports, will we ever get to the point where its games release on PC months after launch instead of years? Could it even pull a Microsoft and drop everything on PC at the same time as console?That's probably a stretch, but God of War is a positive sign. The best game on the PS4 is now one of the best games on PC.I was one of those people that scoffed at Dad of War when it was announced. I thought we were getting The Last of Us with an axe, but instead, we got a fully-fledged RPG with tiered loot and skill trees expertly weaved into a story about power, violence, and bad parents. It's an impressive departure from the edgy slaughter fest that this series used to be and a necessary change if it was going to come back at all. The mountain of money, talent, and time it took to reboot this 2000s relic into something worth existing today is evident in every moment. Four years later, God of War is still a triumph. The best game on PS4 is now one of the best games on PC.Morgan has been writing for PC Gamer since 2018, first as a freelancer and currently as a staff writer.

God of War,Christian Donlan,Eurogamer,https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-04-12-god-of-war-review-astonishing-technological-craft-in-the-service-of-simple-pleasures,"Here comes the head-stepper.Remove the heart. Climb on the chest, feet slapping against sinew and skin. The ruined flesh beneath shudders but holds. The first incision. One to pierce the surface. The second to part the ribs with a brisk crack. The heart is in there, but it's well connected. Reach deep. Pull. Remove the heart. Pull.Something about this incident gets at, well, the heart of God of War. It is ridiculous and petulant, a world in which gods are just giants and giants can be felled and there is still, regardless of your own beliefs or lack of them, something of a guilty shudder to that. But it's also sort of realistic, or at least it cleaves to the most superficial elements of reality: to the human textures of the shells we all bumble around in, the warm depths. And it's disgusting, but it's also businesslike: we are kept in our place, and - if you look closely, as it were, at what we are shown and not shown - we are quietly shielded from the least palatable aspects of it. God of War is so committed to getting us close to acts of depravity that at times - when it's literally tugging at the heart - it steps back just a little and reveals its secret, shameful conservatism.Then there's this, of course: that heart is one grotesque highlight nestled in amongst an endless run of highlights. Everything is a glissando here, in a game of one god set against all the others. Kratos will have forgotten the heart ten minutes from now, even though it bloomed and shimmered when he held it aloft, like a Pimms jug with a couple of glowsticks in it. And ten minutes from then? What fresh horrors will he be up to by that point?None of these things are criticisms. God of War is so lavish, so sharp-edged with technological brilliance, so studied in its understanding of everything a big budget game needs in order to make people feel the bigness of its budget that these internal contradictions are welcome, because they give it a bit of life, a bit of warmth. They give it, I almost want to say, a bit of humanity. Just a bit.Anyway, God of War is back. Not quite rebooted but certainly heavily retooled. Kratos is even more serious now, and even more violent. And he's taken a bit of a trip, washing up in the Christmas forests of Midgard, Greek gods a muddy stain behind him, Norse gods forming a gauntlet of freewheeling hicks and Biro-tatted hoboes up ahead. There's a shift in location, then, but this most beautiful of series is very capable with the frozen north, with rocks and moss and trees and snow underfoot. There's a shift in the cast, but gods are gods in a world like this, which means they are sleazy, compromised, fallen and corrupt. The Greek world was connected by chains, this one is threaded into the roots of a tree, and yet there is an understanding that both realities can coexist. All beliefs are equally real, equally foolish. The chains and the tree do not cancel each other out.So what's the big difference? It's tempting to say that it's the boy - the son, Atreus - that Kratos now takes on his adventure. God of War meets The Last of Us? But this isn't entirely true. We'll get to the boy, but the main shift is one of perspective. In previous God of War games, you were big but the world was bigger, so Kratos, perversely, was often quite small, an ant crawling over a Titan the size of a mountain range. That elastic camera would sacrifice your sense of personal size in order to give the Greek myths their panoramic due. Here, though, Kratos is given his weight and stature and it never leaves him. The camera moves in close and it stays close. We see the world at almost all times from over his gigantic shoulder. He is a marvel: muscle twisting and bunching beneath the tats, weighty flesh casting shadows, skin stretching and revealing scars, one along the back that I cannot stop wincing at, one running over the stomach and suggesting, even if it runs in the wrong direction, a weird hint of cesarean childbirth. Kratos' beard: you can see every strand of the thing, just as you can see the glossy irises of the eyes, just as you can read his age, his agonies, in the bruising beneath the sockets of those eyes. He is the main character, but he is also the theme and the backstory, all of it on display at all times, all of it written in the things that happen to flesh. The world is another marvel, thankfully, capable of suitable deity-crushing bigness despite the fact that you're wedged so close to the surface with none of that sprightly wandering of the old game's cinematic camera. The detailing, though! Silver birches have peeling curlicues of bark, rocks have little cracks running through them, huts are made of planks of wood that do not meet cleanly, that do not match. All of the extraordinary flights of fancy of the gods and their realms builds upon this sense of reality, of messy wilderness. This means when the game takes you somewhere extraordinary it does not purely feel like a set-dressing change, but it also does not feel entirely natural. The gods' worlds are impositions, garish indulgences, and they look like it - because the gods are children, and they are forced, perhaps through the weight of expectations, to remain children. An interesting choice, really, to come in close. These games have always been graphical showcases, and they show, this time, that the things we like to look at have changed. God of War is as spectacular as all the other God of Wars, and there are still those dizzying shifts in scale that define the series' imagination, but the designers have also developed an eye for the smaller things and found a way to make it all work together.It feels a bit like Tomb Raider in this regard - another reboot that sought to bring the camera in closer and rediscover the natural world and make things a little less pulpy as it did so. Crucial to this aim in God of War is Kratos' son. Atreus, who sets off with Kratos at the start of the game on a mournful, treacherous mission that his father does not think he is ready for. The less said of the plot the better - it is simultaneously filled with spoilers and light on any real sense of forward momentum, offering complications and frustrations rather than genuine developments that might enrich proceedings - but the character of Atreus is well-realised for the most part. Sure, he is a surprisingly Californian son for a Greek god seeking refuge in the frozen north - at one point he stalks away from an argument with a petulant, ""Whatever..."" - but this is a series that has always been playful in combining modern sensibilities with its ancient cast, in understanding that the ancients saw their gods as contemporary beings. He is dark-eyed, scarred and watchful, Atreus, but beneath the heavy burden of backstory and the hacked-about Hoxton haircut, he has a lot of genuine child to him. I think someone involved in God of War may even have had a kid of their own for a while. Riding on a timber lift, he will bounce up and down on the springy planks filled with aimless energy. He is nervous around his remote father one minute and teasing the next. He pushes things and you fear for him. This glimmer of actual life inside him makes up for so much of the game's trajectory, which spends too long, in amongst the predictably gradual thawing between father and son, on that annoying idea that the best a child can be is a perfected version of the parent - or that, at the very least, they must in some ways be defined by their relationship to the parent's flaws.Thankfully, as a game character, Atreus behaves very well too, keeping himself alive and warping, I suspect, in and out when I'm not looking to avoid snagging himself on geometry. Out of combat he is a hint system, a plot reminder and a means of making the subtext of a moment clear even to people who like to check their messages during cutscenes. In combat, he is a ranged weapon with his bow and arrow and has some nice magical trinkets hidden away in the upgrade menu. God, it was a happy day when I realised I could slot a rune or whatever it was into a socket in him and make him summon a spectral herd of wild boar at trying moments. That's my boy, off into battle, awaiting my cry of, ""Ghost-pigs! Hit them with the ghost-pigs!""As runes and sockets suggests, God of War has become very excited about items and levels and other RPG trappings. Fights grant XP, which allow you to unlock new skills for your various weapons, but enemies also drop Hacksilver and resources that you can submit to a pair of blacksmiths to buy and upgrade armour and other handy bits of kit. Everything has a socket which allows you to trick things out further, and Kratos' stats are divided into categories like strength, defence, vitality and luck. This stuff links together in a friendly muddle and means that you always have a reason to dip into a menu and give your axe a new pommel, say, which might boost this or that, or to slot an enchantment into armour. I tended to let my XP build up - a sure sign that there isn't anything truly earth-shattering lurking amongst all the literal earth-shattering going on with the skills to spend it on - but it's still nice to locate a perk that allows me to summon a boulder and chuck it, or unlock a nice launcher move. It looks the part, in other words, but the depths are never deep enough to lose your way in. God of War has loot and items and crafting, but it's not Diablo, just as it has a bit of gentle gear-gating but it's not Metroid.What it is is God of War, thankfully, and the recipe is surprisingly unchanged despite the son and his echoes of The Last of Us and despite the new mournfulness and the tragedy beard and the close-up camera. Moment to moment this is light, visually appealing puzzling, often with an enormously satisfying pay-off as ancient machinery turns, or as forgotten doors open, or as an entire island spins on its axis like the mechanism of an old watch. It's a bit of that, yes, and a bit of no-fuss traversal as Atreus hops on your back and you gamble up an artfully rendered cliff-face emerging into the rosy light of another perfect dawn. And then it's a bit of exploration, through a world that is perhaps a little more open than before and has side-quests - and a lot of backtracking - sprinkled in, but remains, at heart, a series of extremely pretty corridors connecting hubs and battle arenas.All of this and then combat, and combat remains the biggy.It is still such a joy, too, such a sometimes-tactical, technical-as-you-want-it-to-be, shamefully violent, blood-rushing pleasure. Kratos appears to have traded his chains for an axe, but the range of the chains is still available since the axe can be chucked at people and then summoned again with an outstretched hand, and it can also be swung with great force and purpose, cleaving distant archers in two, knocking tanks sideways, or sending ripples of ice through the ground. You can parry and dodge with precision, or you can knock down the difficulty to the point where neither is required. Enemies, ranging from teleporting witches to the spindly, Peperami-in-armour forces of the Northern undead Draugr all come with their attack quirks and all succumb eventually, often exploding in bright gouts of Lucozade, while the chugging economy of being an angry god thunders through the game, violence allowing your rage to grow, and rage being cashed in for moments of absolute frenzy in which violence suddenly rebuilds your health bar. Is the axe as much fun as the chains? Not entirely if I'm being honest, and there are signs the developers realise this since the axe is joined, in the second half, by further weapons which should not be spoiled. And as the action increases and the XP starts to get pumped into different abilities, a true synthesis emerges between Kratos and Atreus. In another developer's hands this would have felt like a prolonged escort mission, bringing the kid along, but there is none of that in God of War. On the standard settings, at least, Atreus looks after himself and you both look after each other. The escorting is saved for quiet moments of exposition.The regular fights - elemental baddies, baddies with shields, baddies who hover and spit fire - are so much fun that the bosses almost take a backseat. They're still spectacular, of course, but the stage-management of them, with which they pull you between arena-brawling and moments of lofty on-rails theatrics, make them feel a little less alive than the basic scrapping. In a game about the indulgences of the gods, these are the indulgences of the real higher powers: the designers. Even here, though, the sheer drama of being a god who hates other gods steps in to keep things fresh. You fight a winged beast by racing up over its scaly back and into its mouth where much dentistry awaits; you knock a man through a mountain and then he knocks you through another. It's astonishing stuff to look at and playing on a PS4 Pro the frame-rate never faltered (although the audio occasionally hitched and there was the odd pause for loading).Such are the intricate pleasures of brawling your way through Midgard and beyond, it can sometimes be hard to notice all the game's wilder ambitions. Despite the plotting, I didn't really reflect much on God of War's relationship with the other big relationship games out there: Kratos and Atreus just sort of get on with it. Despite the backtracking, I didn't really think much about the fact that the whole adventure was knotted up in an audacious, improbably calm single shot with no cutaways or flashbacks. There's padding and asset reuse, but look at the richness of the assets and the world they are delivering. And at the end of it there's still so much left to mop up, still so much that remains unseen. God of War does a lot with holy light and crumbling temples, but one of its best moments involves waves of enemies and two bonfires that must not be extinguished. It is capable of making fun from very straightforward things.Yes. Like Kratos, the god of fury who must learn not to fear his son, this is a strange beast, really. The latest technology and astonishing craft and artistry are employed to deliver a game of extremely simple pleasures - a wash of new pseudo-ideas that cannot hide the fact that the basics remain unfixed because they were not broken. God of War dresses things up, in other words, but it is ultimately the same deal it always was. As is the way with myths, I guess. As is the way with gods.You're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!

God of War,Leon Hurley,GamesRadar+,https://www.gamesradar.com/god-of-war-review/,"When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.One of PlayStation’s finest moments, Kratos has been reimagined for a new audience while keeping the best bits of what originally made him great. An incredible spectacle of combat and actionGreat characters, story and a beautifully realised semi-open worldSo much to see, investigate and doUpgrades are initially confusingIt’s not always clear if you have the right tool for an enemy or puzzle yetWhy you can trust GamesRadar+ 


Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy.There’s a moment in God of War when you realise you can go anywhere. Clear of the opening set up, the game steps back, presents you with a map of the world and says, ‘you know what? You’re a demigod, you’ve got a boat: sort yourself out.’ It’s perhaps the biggest change to the series, aside from the [deep breath] combat, Kratos, timezone, location, gods, monsters... beard. The ability to go anywhere and do anything in a semi-open world suddenly makes this as much about your journey through Kratos’ story as it is any of his goals. Don’t worry, though, there’s still a tightly woven tale here. It’s beautifully rhythmic and perfectly paced as it ebbs and flows through violently crashing narrative crescendos and quieter, expositional lulls. Now, however, you can control when to mainline the plot, or just wander off in a canoe and explore. For a series more traditionally built on a carefully controlled theme park ride of excitement and set pieces, this newfound freedom is just as much a rush as any building-sized monster with oh-so-gougeable eyes. These changes mean this God of War works whether it's your first time with Kratos or you know the man well. There are call outs that will mean more to some than others, but nothing to alienate a newcomer. The new (old) world Kratos now roams the Norse realm of Midgard. He’s older, beardier and a very changed man, mourning a wife not long dead and with a son, Atreus, to raise. I’ll steer clear of any spoilers but, safe to say, some things happen, and you set off into the world to do something about it. Mainly by being grumpy about stuff and hitting it with an axe. God of War won't stop with Norse mythology - prepare for ancient Egyptian and Mayan locations tooPerhaps God of War’s greatest achievement in all this is making Kratos a likable character. The original PS2 games’ vicious edge and misogyny got somewhat of a pass from its cartoonish sheen and sheer outlandishness but, as things got more realistic on PS3, the Ghost of Sparta became increasingly harder to enjoy. He was just a spiteful, cruel man full of rage and with almost no redeeming qualities. Now, he’s wiser: aware of, and unhappy with, his past. Trying, as he so often repeats to Atreus, to “be better” while gruffly and inexpertly attempting to pass on what he’s learned the long way round to prevent his son repeating his mistakes. Hoping to make both the boy and his future a better place as a result. This is wisely done without ever ignoring what went before - Kratos never denies or excuses his history, just a desire to ensure he doesn’t pass it on. It’s not hard to read more into the God of War’s attempts to be a good man as the series reinvents itself for a new generation, minus the sex mini-games and exposed breasts of before. As a result the relationship between father and son is everything. It’s full of frustration, awkward moments of bonding, and popping breakthroughs of progress. You’ll be rooting as much for them to just sort it out, as you are for hacking up a 30 foot troll. Their chats, as you explore, develop them, the world and characters around them in detail, and every person you meet is expertly realised, written and performed. This has some of the best storytelling and cast in a game for a long time, and even the most incidental conversation is written with all the weight and care of a major cutscene. It’s funny too, in a very ‘real’ way, not just jokes for jokes’ sake. I can’t say much without spoiling it but there are interactions, one liners and interplays that feel believable and human, even if there is a massive fantasy monster crashing about in the background. Plus it’s got one of most interesting and different villains I’ve seen for awhile. Every person you meet is expertly realised, written and performed. This has some of the best storytelling and cast in a game for a long timeYou’ve probably noticed I haven’t even touched on the combat yet, mainly because there’s so much going on with characters, world and story. There is plenty of fighting though, so don’t worry - brutal, bloody, ‘can’t unsee what you just did to that man’s face’ fighting, with a system that’s spectacularly physical and flexible. Kratos’ chained blades have been replaced by the Leviathan Axe, a more focused and drawn in weapon. Using a combo system of light and heavy blows it’s about prioritising threats and managing space with dodges and parries around ever-closing enemies.The upgrade systems driving the combat are huge, letting you build out both Kratos and Atreus’ abilities, gear and armour on multiple skill trees: the latter mainly able to unleash stunning arrows, or choke enemies (weakening them for an axing) with a press of Square. Then there’s magic, the ability to throw the axe as a projectile and fight with your fists, a shield for rebounding parries, and more. The options initially seem daunting because of the scale - there’s just so much to consider with a range of stats that can be hard to decipher at first. Is +3 Strength better than +10 Runic overall? If this new bit of kit drops my Luck by two will that matter? If I’m honest I didn’t feel entirely comfortable with it all that until at least 20 hour so hours in. However, the system grows as you master it into a devastating arsenal of splintering, crushing damage. It’s a beautiful thing to watch as you swiftly dodge and counter, or time a cleaving blow perfectly. Atreus also becomes increasingly useful as you power him up and, by the end, you’ll be fighting as a coordinated unit - both from hammering Square to call out his arrows and magic, or contextual attacks. For example, when you’re bent over from a heavy axe blow he’ll jump from your shoulders to rain arrows down on your target as he flies past. It is just the best thing.Elsewhere this is every bit as brutally unflinching as previous games. Rib cages are torn open with bare hands, or jaws are left hanging on strips of skin. Vicious curb stomps will make you flinch for a second, before gently whispering ‘again’ and diving straight back in. Unrecognisable in a lot of ways, this still is 100% a God of War game when the action flexes it ample muscle. The series’ sense of scale is still there, just redirected and more equally distributed. In the same way the old games would make you blink in disbelief at the scale of a single boss fight or set piece, this applies that to the entire world. Every region, each place you visit, has a colossus, hydra or Titan’s worth of ‘WOW’ applied across every inch of Midgard’s soil, rock and mountains. There are frogs in this game, hopping around the background, that are better crafted than some entire game campaigns. And, when the game does roll up its sleeves for a spectacle, it does not disappoint.How God of War's combat team made Kratos' new axe feel so goodSomething that’s really cleverly done is how you use your flesh-rending arsenal to also interact with the wider world. God of War’s map is full of puzzles and navigational obstacles to hack, thump and fire at. For a vocabulary mainly built on hitting things it’s incredible just how satisfying the language of solving problems is. At a basic level your axe can freeze cogs to hold a door open, say, but as you progress, how you reach that cog escalates, or other mechanics come into play. There are gear-gated elements that hold things back for later with barriers you can’t pass or solve until you have certain items or skills. These gently corral you back to the main story, only to return later with a new tool and a dawning epiphany of what that means for whatever you couldn’t get past before. Even now, a good 15 hours post credits, I’m still finding new areas, and puzzles that have me slow-clapping the screen at whoever made the damn thing. They’re rarely a chore and with a level of ingenuity up there with Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild’s Korok Seeds when you see something familiar flipped in a way you’d never have predicted. It’s a world that continues in a very satisfying way long after you’ve ‘finished’ the main story. You can occasionally find yourself unsure if you’re doing something wrong, or don’t have the right equipment yetThat openness, combined with the range of abilities to unlock, can leave you a little confused sometimes. Possibly my only real criticism is that you can occasionally find yourself unsure if you’re doing something wrong, or don’t have the right equipment yet. Is it you, or the game, that has the problem? Are you solving this puzzle wrong? Or just lacking the right tool? Is this enemy too hard for a reason? Or just because you haven’t found the thing that hurts it more?Realistically, however, I don’t think it’s possible to overstate just how good God of War is; how well realised its world, how nuanced and layered its characters and storytelling. The depth and craft of its combat, puzzles and almost every system it has sparkles and shines with an indulgence and luxury that regularly stopped me in my tracks to drink it all in. Whether breathless and bloody in the aftermath of an axe-hacked victory, or watching Kratos and his son Atreus share a genuinely human moment, this is a level of game making that doesn’t happen often. The final question really isn’t about where it sits in any game of the year discussions, but rather its place in eventual game of the generation talks. I'm GamesRadar's Senior Guides Co-ordinator, which means I run GamesRadar's guides and tips content.

God of War,Joe Juba,Game Informer,http://www.gameinformer.com/games/god_of_war/b/playstation4/archive/2018/04/12/god-of-war-ps4-review-game-informer.aspx,"In gruff moments of fatherly instruction, Kratos repeats the phrase “be better” to his son, Atreus. This happens in different contexts, but the lesson remains consistent: Your decisions are not bound by precedent, and the choices of others are not examples to follow – they only set standards you can strive to exceed. In developing the latest God of War, Sony’s Santa Monica studio apparently took this message to heart. While previous games in this series established a successful formula of stylish action and epic setpieces, the team used this opportunity to be better; with surprising changes on every front, God of War forges a new identity and surpasses even its most acclaimed predecessors.As a longtime fan of the series, this entry captivated me for completely different reasons. The narrative is one of them, despite its simple premise: Kratos and Atreus need to reach the top of the highest mountain in the Norse domain. They encounter detours and surprises along the way, but the precise story beats are less important than how they are conveyed. God of War brilliantly presents a desolate journey in a gorgeous world, all through the lens of the relationship between a distant father and his eager son.The interactions of Kratos and Atreus range from adversarial to compassionate, and these exchanges have ample room to breathe and draw players in. Atreus wonders what he might say to his departed mother if given the chance – an exercise Kratos finds pointless. When Kratos artlessly paraphrases the fable of the tortoise and the hare, Atreus mocks his lack of storytelling prowess. These quiet moments are interesting, slowly and believably closing the distance between two characters – a focus that contrasts sharply with previous games. In terse responses and long silences, Kratos conveys more than he ever did cursing Olympus at the top of his lungs.That isn’t to say God of War has sacrificed its ability to deliver incredible spectacle. An early encounter (against a mysterious enemy called the Stranger) sets the bar absurdly high, and a cathartic sequence later on stands out as my favorite moment in the series to date. Between those points and beyond, the adventure is punctuated by a steady flow of enormous beasts, ancient architecture, and intense boss fights. The environments and characters look fantastic, and a new cinematic camera angle brings you close the action and never cuts away – a decision that proves immensely rewarding during big moments by giving you an intimate view. Despite this more grounded approach to presentation, the action’s scope and ambition is stunning in cutscenes and combat alike.The Greek world may be gone, but Kratos is still a god of war, and his skill on the battlefield is appropriately divine. He fires off magic attacks and performs brutal executions in his attempts to defeat a clever assortment of foes from Norse myth. The ice-infused axe Leviathan is a drastic departure from the iconic Blades of Chaos Kratos once wielded, but it is a well-balanced and entertaining tool of destruction. I like how it emphasizes a more calculated style of combat; instead of zoomed-out, combo-driven encounters, Leviathan makes you a tactician. You can’t cut through huge swaths of enemies with it, so you need to consider how to manage your foes. You can freeze one from afar by throwing your axe, then use your fists to stun and grab another, then recall Leviathan for an area-of-effect ice burst. This kind of strategy gives many fights – especially one-on-one bosses – an engaging duel-like quality. Plus, the “thunk” of Leviathan magically flying back into Kratos’ hand is satisfying every time.During the first few hours, I had doubts about the axe-and-shield emphasis. In those opening segments, crowded melees are difficult to navigate due to off-screen attacks, which encouraged me to keep my distance – at least until I got more comfortable with key mechanics like parrying. After that, I quickly came around; the combat system’s gradual unfolding in God of War is a joy. Though it may feel restrictive at first, before long you are rapidly alternating between all the tools and skills at your disposal, including your fists, Spartan Rage, Leviathan, and more. Cooldown-regulated runic attacks provide a diverse and unique array of special moves, like a freezing beam or a stunning blast, and I had fun experimenting with them and seeing which ones I wanted to cycle into my regular rotation.You spend experience to unlock cool new techniques, and they aren’t just damage or range improvements; several have a significant impact on your options, like Kratos assuming a secondary stance from which additional attacks are possible. I also leaned on Atreus for assistance, since his arrows are crucial for incapacitating many creatures. Some of these concepts are introduced too slowly, but on the other hand, I relished how God of War’s battles avoid stagnation through constant evolution.Underlying all of your combat endeavors is a surprisingly involved gear system that gives you an avenue to customize your arsenal, but also dangles aspirational goals in front of you. Many of your deeds provide materials and equipment as rewards, and like an RPG, you see the numbers next to your stats increase as you build and equip new items. You also see materials you don’t have for pieces of gear you want to craft, which adds to the excitement when that item finally drops after finishing a sidequest or beating a tough foe. This layer of upgrading may be less exciting than learning new moves to chop up monsters, but it still provides a powerful incentive to explore.While not strictly open-world, the game has a large lake with various shores and islands available for free exploration. I loved systematically checking out new locations and acquiring crafting materials, enchantments, and other rewards. These excursions are largely optional, but they are the best way to ensure that you have everything you need for equipment upkeep. As a bonus, these diversions flesh out the world with some interesting NPCs, in addition to offering some fun (but not too challenging) puzzle-like scenarios. They can provide a nice break from the main story, but they’re always available, so you don’t need to invest in them at the expense of the narrative pacing.God of War’s momentum rarely falters, and when it does, the inconvenience is brief. For example, you have the freedom to explore, but the map isn’t especially helpful for tracking your position relative to the things you are interested in, and the fast-travel system is weirdly cumbersome and opens up too late. This is more frustrating if you plan on being thorough with collectibles and post-game objectives (no new game+ this time around), but that didn’t dampen my enthusiasm for climbing cliffs and delving into ruins long after the 30 hours I spent finishing the main story.Years ago, Kratos killed the deities of Mount Olympus in a gory rampage. Now, in the Norse realm, he has remade himself into a different kind of god. He is quieter and more deliberate, affected by his history but not constrained by it. Kratos’ reinvention serves as a narrative hook, but it also parallels the series’ evolution as a whole; where God of War once relied on bombast and bloodlust, now it leaves space for strategy and nuance. It still has superb action and plenty of jaw-dropping moments, but it supports them with a new level of depth and maturity. God of War learns from its past while clearing an exciting path for the future, and emerges as one of the best games of this generation.

   on January 12, 2022 at 8:00AM PSTThis review has been updated to include impressions of God of War's PC version, released in 2022. The initial review, written by Peter Brown in 2018, follows. The new text, written by Phil Hornshaw in 2022, has been added at the bottom of the original review.The God of War series has, until now, stuck very close to the standards set in the original 2005 game. More than a decade (and many games) later, it makes sense that Sony would want to mix things up for the aged hack-and-slash series. Like so many popular franchises that have reinvented themselves in recent years, the new God of War dips into the well of open-world RPG tropes. It also shifts its focus to Norse mythology, casting off the iconic Greek gods and legends that provided the basis for every previous game.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: God Of War Video ReviewThese major shifts don't signal the end of God of War as we know it, rather they allow the series' DNA to express itself in new ways. There are many reasons why the structural transformations are a good thing, but it's what's become of Kratos, the hulking death machine, that leaves a lasting impression. A furious, bloodthirsty icon has transformed into a sensitive father figure. Part of him retains the old violent tendencies that made him a star long ago. However, with his young son Atreus to protect and guide, we also see Kratos take a deep breath and bury his savage instincts in order to set a positive example.Watching Kratos take care in nurturing his child's sensibilities does feel a bit jarring at the start, but thanks to the natural writing, fitting voice actors, and flawless animation, it's easy to get sucked into the duo's journey and buy into their mutual growth. Though he is a teacher, Kratos carries a mountain of grief and self-pity that only the innocence of his son can help him overcome. And Atreus experiences his own ups and downs that might have set him down a very different path if not for Kratos' guiding hand.Atreus was raised in isolation from the dangers of the wild world around him, and rightfully fails to grasp his place in it when confronted with the realities of a land protected by and under siege from gods. It's the death of his mother prior to the start of the game that thrusts Atreus and Kratos outward; her dying wish was to have her ashes spread atop the highest peak in the land. As if wild predators and ghastly fiends weren't obstacles enough, representatives from the pantheon of Norse mythology arise in an attempt to disrupt their mission, establishing the amplified stakes and the clash of impressive forces that you expect from God of War.And like its predecessors, God of War is a technical and artistic showcase. It is without a doubt one of the best-looking console games ever released, with every breathtaking environment and mythical character exhibiting impressive attention to detail and beautifying flourishes aplenty. The vision behind all of this is evident in Kratos' meticulously grizzled physique and weathered equipment, in the atmospheric effects that transform believably rustic environments into the stuff of dreams, and in the overall design and structure of the world itself.The majority of the journey is set in the realm of Midgard. At its heart lies a wide lake that you can explore by canoe, with a coastline dotted by optional puzzles, formidable opponents, and entrances to the map's primary regions. Your mission will carry you through to most of these places, and along the way you'll likely take note of inaccessible pathways and glimpses of sealed treasures. There's always ample room to explore off the main path and good reasons to give into curiosity regardless, but these teases in particular spur you to re-examine previously visited areas as your capabilities expand.With the boy fighting by your side, firing arrows or choking unsuspecting enemies, you will team up against corrupted cave trolls, face towering beasts, and fight hundreds of intelligent supernatural warriors during your travels. Kratos prefers to use an axe these days, which functions very differently than the chained Blades of Chaos he's known for. This comes with the very satisfying and cool ability to magically summon your weapon to your hand (like Thor and his hammer), a move that never gets old.And really, neither does combat in general. The new over-the-shoulder camera brings you directly into the fray, and consequently limits your view. You can't see enemies from all angles at once and must be on guard at all times. By default the game provides proximity icons to alert you of incoming attacks, but it's worth tinkering with the UI for a more immersive experience as you get the hang of how fights flow.It's rare that you can actually spam combos without putting yourself at risk, and this emphasis on mindfulness solidifies God of War's graduation from the traditional hack-and-slash doldrums. The realities of fighting with an axe also makes skirting away from harm an exacting process. But when variables align and you get to lay into an enemy, Kratos' dexterous axe handling allow him to hit hard, and give you the opportunity to flex his might with a bit of style.The basic set of close-range combos and weapon behaviors can be expanded by pouring experience points into a skill tree and by activating magical rune abilities that bind to your two attack inputs. There are a lot of options to consider and tactics to learn, including skill trees for fighting empty-handed. There's a wonderful rhythm to be found when switching from axe to fists, and then into Kratos' satisfyingly brutal execution moves, all the while ducking and rolling out of harm's way.God of War's combat is already great at the start, but it gets better as it steadily introduces one new layer after another. You can absolutely stumble into incredibly punishing enemies that are made easier with adept timing and mastery of every available skill, but you can also succeed at any level so long as you've mastered the art of parrying and dodging incoming attacks.Atreus can't be configured to the same extent that Kratos can, but there are still a lot of ways to tailor his capabilities to your liking. The arrows he fires can be laced with different types of magic, with multiple elemental and functionality upgrades, and he eventually gains the ability to summon spectral animals that can harm and distract enemies, or collect items. Thanks to the smart button layout, it's actually very easy to both attack and defend as Kratos while also commanding Atreus. God of War gives you plenty to do in any given moment and makes you feel like an experienced warrior in the process.The armor that Kratos and Atreus wear can influence a range of character stats, elemental affinities, and may include slots for enchantments that grant further bonuses. Armor can be purchased or crafted using the few resources scattered about the world, and can be upgraded by the game's two blacksmiths: two dwarven brothers constantly at odds with each other. There's Brok, the foul-mouthed blue dwarf, and Sindri, a far more gentle yet tragically germophobic fellow--a gag that is usually funny, though occasionally pushed a bit too hard.As enjoyable as those two can be, it's Mimir that ultimately steals the show. The horned, one-eyed sage accompanies you and Atreus for the majority of the game, serving as your guide to Midgard, and an inside source into the ins and outs of Norse politics. Mimir and the blacksmiths have strong individual personalities, as with every other character you meet during the course of the game. We're keeping other identities vague in general to avoid spoilers, but regardless of who you bump into, God of War's cast is strong, convincing, and oddly enchanting. But the real accomplishment is how, even though there are just a handful of characters to interact with, their big personalities color your adventure with tantalizing anecdotes that draw you into the world and imbue the land with a tangible sense of history.If there's any piece of the overarching mission that feels like a letdown, it's the final battle against the primary antagonist. He's great from a narrative standpoint, unraveling in a manner that changes your perspective, but it's the fight itself that leaves you wanting. There are plenty of big boss battles and tests of skill throughout the course of the game, yet this fight doesn't reach the same heights, and feels like it was played a little safe. It could be an effect of configuring Kratos and Atreus just so, or it may just be too easy to begin with. Thankfully, that's not all the game has up its sleeve.Two optional areas in particular seem designed with the endgame in mind. The first, Muspelheim, offers a series of battles in arenas surrounded by lava flows and scorched earth. Some trials are merely fights against strong enemies, while others require you to defeat waves in quick succession--if even one enemy remains alive, it only takes a few seconds for others to resurrect automatically. The other realm, Niflheim, is randomly generated every time you visit, but it's always filled with poisonous gas. The goal there is to survive for as long as possible while racking up kills and collecting treasure, and escape before the poison takes hold. Both locations offer tense and rewarding pursuits that are only accessible if you play at your best.And odds are that you'll be so hooked by the story's pacing and procession of events that there will be plenty of other side activities left in Midgard after the credits roll. God of War isn't set in a massive open world, but it is stuffed with secrets and quests. Where most games with long and diverse quest opportunities tend to run a bit stale by the end, God of War has the opposite effect. It's far longer than it needs to be, though you hope you never run out of things to do.In many ways God of War is what the series has always been. It's a spectacular action game with epic set pieces, big-budget production values, and hard-hitting combat that grows more feverish and impressive as you progress. What may surprise you is how mature its storytelling has become. Like Kratos, God of War recalls the past while acknowledging the need to improve. Everything new it does is for the better, and everything it holds onto benefits as a result. Kratos is no longer a predictable brute. God of War is no longer an old-fashioned action series. With this reboot, it confidently walks a new path that will hopefully lead to more exciting adventures to come.Nearly four years after its initial release, God of War has finally made its way to PC. If you haven't yet checked out Sony Santa Monica's lengthy tale of Mad Dad Kratos and Boy, the PC version is the one you should grab. It doesn't bring any new content to the table, but it does offer graphical options that make an already beautiful game look even better.The PC version of God of War supports 4k resolution and unlocked framerates, DLSS and ultrawide displays, as well as some more granular options for tweaking the look of the game, like turning up the resolution of textures or enhancing the appearance of shadows. Probably the most notable improvement is the unlocked framerate, which makes for some buttery smooth moments of Kratos slamming the Leviathan Axe into draugr and trolls. God of War ran at 30fps on PlayStation 4, so if this is your first time playing or revisiting the game since then (without, say, the upgrade to its PlayStation 5 version), the higher framerate is a nice step forward for a game that's all about slick animations and the flow state of building devastating combos. Generally, though, God of War was a very pretty game even in its PS4 incarnation, and it remains a very pretty game here, whether you're turning up the graphics and framerate or not. Apart from the amped-up graphical capabilities, the other main upgrade in the PC version is customization. You can do a lot to mess with the game's graphics, heads-up display, and camera controls to make God of War play the way you want. Like other PC games, God of War also supports a variety of control setups--while PlayStation players are limited to using the DualShock or DualSense, you're not locked into those on PC. I played almost exclusively with an Xbox gamepad, and it felt just as natural as if the game had been made to play on the platform from the start. While you can't remap gamepad controls, everything can be customized if you're playing with a mouse and keyboard for even more opportunities to adjust how the game feels.God of War isn't drastically different on PC when compared to the PS4 version that launched back in 2018, but its little improvements are definitely nice ones, making this a solid PC port overall. There isn't reason enough here to buy a second copy of the game if you've already played, necessarily, but the PC version is a great reason to check out God of War for the first time for anybody who hasn't had a chance to experience it. God of War remains an excellent, gorgeous, affecting action game, and with the port to PC, it gets a handful of nice, if somewhat minor, improvements.God Of War is featured as one of the best PS5 games.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"
God of War,Ryan Gilliam,Polygon,https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22878555/god-of-war-pc-steam-epic-review-ragnarok-playstation-kratos,"Filed under:Before Ragnarok later this year, God of War finally comes to a new audience2018’s God of War is one of the best games ever made. And with its move to Windows PC nearly four years after launch, it’s managed to get even better.God of War surprised players with the ways in which it matured the series — like making Kratos a character people care about rather than an unrepentant bastard, and doing away with the extreme objectification of female characters. But as much as developer Sony Santa Monica focused on building a new legacy, it didn’t do away with the past completely.God of War picks up years after Kratos’ adventures through Greece, where he slew the entire pantheon of Olympian gods. Now he’s a father, again, and he’s trying to pull his son, Atreus, in a different direction, to help Atreus avoid some of the cruel mistakes Kratos made in his previous lives on PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3.Polygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences.

If you want curated lists of our favorite media, check out What to Play and What to Watch.It’s still a series about rage, but instead of focusing on the youthful frustrations of the past, it offers a more mature take. Fear is the new heart at the center of Kratos’ fury — fear that Kratos’ past will never let him be at peace, that his son will discover who he truly is, and that he’s too broken to ever be the father he needs to be. And of course, fear fuels a new rogues’ gallery of enemies — the Norse gods — who are all fighting to stave off the end of the world. God of War wraps a beautiful story into a tight third-person action and puzzle game. It demonstrates a fervid appreciation for Norse myths in the way it makes these gods into compelling characters. It takes RPG systems, narrative-based exploration, unique weapons, and storytelling tricks from different kinds of games, and melds them all together perfectly. It’s a marvel of modern game design, but it’s been shackled to PlayStation for years, limiting both its technical potential as well as the number of people who can experience it.With this PC release, Sony has not only brought an excellent game to masses of PC players; it has also given God of War a second life as a visual feast. The original release looked great in 2018 on PlayStation 4, and in 2021 on PlayStation 5. But in 2022, God of War looks downright gorgeous on PC.On ultra settings, God of War runs smoothly at 120 frames per second in 1080p  resolution on my PC. (I’m rocking an Nvidia RTX 3080 with a Core i7-10700K processor at 3.80 GHz and 32 GB of RAM.) The melted innards of Draugr splinter apart with a crack when Kratos rips the creatures open, spewing orange viscera everywhere. During emotional moments, the subtle twitches of Kratos’ face betray his thoughts beautifully. And during close-up shots, I can count the individual gray hairs in his beautifully detailed beard.

  Nothing compares to playing a game like God of War for the first time, seeing the way the water rushes out of the Lake of Nine as Jörmungandr, the World Serpent, rises from beneath the waves. But when the giant snake opened his mouth, and his voice bellowed through my headphones, I was even more awestruck by his design — his 4-year-old model and textures look excellent, even with my face just inches away from the monitor. The water dripping off of his mossy beard, the shadows in his nostrils, and his throat wavering while he speaks — it all looks better than ever. It’s the same game, but with its already impressive sets and visuals turned up, creating an even more immersive experience.But my beautiful PC playthrough wasn’t without some hiccups. On rare occasions, I experienced minor screen tearing during quick turns. Kratos’ armor also occasionally clips through his body or objects. The enhanced visuals make the 2018 level of detail on certain textures — like a rare kind of chest, made of a bright gold — more noticeable, with the game’s improved shadows seemingly not pulling the same weight on brighter textures. But those blemishes were the exception to the rule, thrown into contrast by the beauty seen everywhere else in the game. The excellent visuals and smooth performance of the PC version is something I’d hoped for — a way to see this excellent game in a new light, not constrained by my PS4 that was just a few years away from being benched for a PS5. God of War is an exciting addition to anyone’s Steam or Epic Games Store library because it looks beautiful and runs almost perfectly, but there’s another reason to be glad about its jump to PC: A legion of new players will get to experience Sony Santa Monica’s magnum opus for the first time.With Sony’s recent move to get some of its exclusive titles (Horizon Zero Dawn, Ghost of Tsushima, Days Gone) into the hands of PC players, it’s opening itself up to an even wider fan base. Sure, some of those players might buy a console to check out God of War Ragnarok later this year, but that’s not the point. God of War is my go-to example of how mechanics and storytelling can combine to create something distinct from other mediums, a game I recommend to nongamer friends and family all the time (with a high degree of success). It was always a bummer that it took buying into a single console ecosystem to experience this game, and now, it doesn’t.God of War on PC is more than just a great visual upgrade for an already stunning game. It’s the best version of one of the best games ever made, perfect for replays and first run-throughs alike. God of War will be released Jan. 14 on Windows PC. The game was reviewed using a Steam key provided by PlayStation. Vox Media has affiliate partnerships.

   on January 12, 2022 at 8:00AM PSTThis review has been updated to include impressions of God of War's PC version, released in 2022. The initial review, written by Peter Brown in 2018, follows. The new text, written by Phil Hornshaw in 2022, has been added at the bottom of the original review.The God of War series has, until now, stuck very close to the standards set in the original 2005 game. More than a decade (and many games) later, it makes sense that Sony would want to mix things up for the aged hack-and-slash series. Like so many popular franchises that have reinvented themselves in recent years, the new God of War dips into the well of open-world RPG tropes. It also shifts its focus to Norse mythology, casting off the iconic Greek gods and legends that provided the basis for every previous game.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: God Of War Video ReviewThese major shifts don't signal the end of God of War as we know it, rather they allow the series' DNA to express itself in new ways. There are many reasons why the structural transformations are a good thing, but it's what's become of Kratos, the hulking death machine, that leaves a lasting impression. A furious, bloodthirsty icon has transformed into a sensitive father figure. Part of him retains the old violent tendencies that made him a star long ago. However, with his young son Atreus to protect and guide, we also see Kratos take a deep breath and bury his savage instincts in order to set a positive example.Watching Kratos take care in nurturing his child's sensibilities does feel a bit jarring at the start, but thanks to the natural writing, fitting voice actors, and flawless animation, it's easy to get sucked into the duo's journey and buy into their mutual growth. Though he is a teacher, Kratos carries a mountain of grief and self-pity that only the innocence of his son can help him overcome. And Atreus experiences his own ups and downs that might have set him down a very different path if not for Kratos' guiding hand.Atreus was raised in isolation from the dangers of the wild world around him, and rightfully fails to grasp his place in it when confronted with the realities of a land protected by and under siege from gods. It's the death of his mother prior to the start of the game that thrusts Atreus and Kratos outward; her dying wish was to have her ashes spread atop the highest peak in the land. As if wild predators and ghastly fiends weren't obstacles enough, representatives from the pantheon of Norse mythology arise in an attempt to disrupt their mission, establishing the amplified stakes and the clash of impressive forces that you expect from God of War.And like its predecessors, God of War is a technical and artistic showcase. It is without a doubt one of the best-looking console games ever released, with every breathtaking environment and mythical character exhibiting impressive attention to detail and beautifying flourishes aplenty. The vision behind all of this is evident in Kratos' meticulously grizzled physique and weathered equipment, in the atmospheric effects that transform believably rustic environments into the stuff of dreams, and in the overall design and structure of the world itself.The majority of the journey is set in the realm of Midgard. At its heart lies a wide lake that you can explore by canoe, with a coastline dotted by optional puzzles, formidable opponents, and entrances to the map's primary regions. Your mission will carry you through to most of these places, and along the way you'll likely take note of inaccessible pathways and glimpses of sealed treasures. There's always ample room to explore off the main path and good reasons to give into curiosity regardless, but these teases in particular spur you to re-examine previously visited areas as your capabilities expand.With the boy fighting by your side, firing arrows or choking unsuspecting enemies, you will team up against corrupted cave trolls, face towering beasts, and fight hundreds of intelligent supernatural warriors during your travels. Kratos prefers to use an axe these days, which functions very differently than the chained Blades of Chaos he's known for. This comes with the very satisfying and cool ability to magically summon your weapon to your hand (like Thor and his hammer), a move that never gets old.And really, neither does combat in general. The new over-the-shoulder camera brings you directly into the fray, and consequently limits your view. You can't see enemies from all angles at once and must be on guard at all times. By default the game provides proximity icons to alert you of incoming attacks, but it's worth tinkering with the UI for a more immersive experience as you get the hang of how fights flow.It's rare that you can actually spam combos without putting yourself at risk, and this emphasis on mindfulness solidifies God of War's graduation from the traditional hack-and-slash doldrums. The realities of fighting with an axe also makes skirting away from harm an exacting process. But when variables align and you get to lay into an enemy, Kratos' dexterous axe handling allow him to hit hard, and give you the opportunity to flex his might with a bit of style.The basic set of close-range combos and weapon behaviors can be expanded by pouring experience points into a skill tree and by activating magical rune abilities that bind to your two attack inputs. There are a lot of options to consider and tactics to learn, including skill trees for fighting empty-handed. There's a wonderful rhythm to be found when switching from axe to fists, and then into Kratos' satisfyingly brutal execution moves, all the while ducking and rolling out of harm's way.God of War's combat is already great at the start, but it gets better as it steadily introduces one new layer after another. You can absolutely stumble into incredibly punishing enemies that are made easier with adept timing and mastery of every available skill, but you can also succeed at any level so long as you've mastered the art of parrying and dodging incoming attacks.Atreus can't be configured to the same extent that Kratos can, but there are still a lot of ways to tailor his capabilities to your liking. The arrows he fires can be laced with different types of magic, with multiple elemental and functionality upgrades, and he eventually gains the ability to summon spectral animals that can harm and distract enemies, or collect items. Thanks to the smart button layout, it's actually very easy to both attack and defend as Kratos while also commanding Atreus. God of War gives you plenty to do in any given moment and makes you feel like an experienced warrior in the process.The armor that Kratos and Atreus wear can influence a range of character stats, elemental affinities, and may include slots for enchantments that grant further bonuses. Armor can be purchased or crafted using the few resources scattered about the world, and can be upgraded by the game's two blacksmiths: two dwarven brothers constantly at odds with each other. There's Brok, the foul-mouthed blue dwarf, and Sindri, a far more gentle yet tragically germophobic fellow--a gag that is usually funny, though occasionally pushed a bit too hard.As enjoyable as those two can be, it's Mimir that ultimately steals the show. The horned, one-eyed sage accompanies you and Atreus for the majority of the game, serving as your guide to Midgard, and an inside source into the ins and outs of Norse politics. Mimir and the blacksmiths have strong individual personalities, as with every other character you meet during the course of the game. We're keeping other identities vague in general to avoid spoilers, but regardless of who you bump into, God of War's cast is strong, convincing, and oddly enchanting. But the real accomplishment is how, even though there are just a handful of characters to interact with, their big personalities color your adventure with tantalizing anecdotes that draw you into the world and imbue the land with a tangible sense of history.If there's any piece of the overarching mission that feels like a letdown, it's the final battle against the primary antagonist. He's great from a narrative standpoint, unraveling in a manner that changes your perspective, but it's the fight itself that leaves you wanting. There are plenty of big boss battles and tests of skill throughout the course of the game, yet this fight doesn't reach the same heights, and feels like it was played a little safe. It could be an effect of configuring Kratos and Atreus just so, or it may just be too easy to begin with. Thankfully, that's not all the game has up its sleeve.Two optional areas in particular seem designed with the endgame in mind. The first, Muspelheim, offers a series of battles in arenas surrounded by lava flows and scorched earth. Some trials are merely fights against strong enemies, while others require you to defeat waves in quick succession--if even one enemy remains alive, it only takes a few seconds for others to resurrect automatically. The other realm, Niflheim, is randomly generated every time you visit, but it's always filled with poisonous gas. The goal there is to survive for as long as possible while racking up kills and collecting treasure, and escape before the poison takes hold. Both locations offer tense and rewarding pursuits that are only accessible if you play at your best.And odds are that you'll be so hooked by the story's pacing and procession of events that there will be plenty of other side activities left in Midgard after the credits roll. God of War isn't set in a massive open world, but it is stuffed with secrets and quests. Where most games with long and diverse quest opportunities tend to run a bit stale by the end, God of War has the opposite effect. It's far longer than it needs to be, though you hope you never run out of things to do.In many ways God of War is what the series has always been. It's a spectacular action game with epic set pieces, big-budget production values, and hard-hitting combat that grows more feverish and impressive as you progress. What may surprise you is how mature its storytelling has become. Like Kratos, God of War recalls the past while acknowledging the need to improve. Everything new it does is for the better, and everything it holds onto benefits as a result. Kratos is no longer a predictable brute. God of War is no longer an old-fashioned action series. With this reboot, it confidently walks a new path that will hopefully lead to more exciting adventures to come.Nearly four years after its initial release, God of War has finally made its way to PC. If you haven't yet checked out Sony Santa Monica's lengthy tale of Mad Dad Kratos and Boy, the PC version is the one you should grab. It doesn't bring any new content to the table, but it does offer graphical options that make an already beautiful game look even better.The PC version of God of War supports 4k resolution and unlocked framerates, DLSS and ultrawide displays, as well as some more granular options for tweaking the look of the game, like turning up the resolution of textures or enhancing the appearance of shadows. Probably the most notable improvement is the unlocked framerate, which makes for some buttery smooth moments of Kratos slamming the Leviathan Axe into draugr and trolls. God of War ran at 30fps on PlayStation 4, so if this is your first time playing or revisiting the game since then (without, say, the upgrade to its PlayStation 5 version), the higher framerate is a nice step forward for a game that's all about slick animations and the flow state of building devastating combos. Generally, though, God of War was a very pretty game even in its PS4 incarnation, and it remains a very pretty game here, whether you're turning up the graphics and framerate or not. Apart from the amped-up graphical capabilities, the other main upgrade in the PC version is customization. You can do a lot to mess with the game's graphics, heads-up display, and camera controls to make God of War play the way you want. Like other PC games, God of War also supports a variety of control setups--while PlayStation players are limited to using the DualShock or DualSense, you're not locked into those on PC. I played almost exclusively with an Xbox gamepad, and it felt just as natural as if the game had been made to play on the platform from the start. While you can't remap gamepad controls, everything can be customized if you're playing with a mouse and keyboard for even more opportunities to adjust how the game feels.God of War isn't drastically different on PC when compared to the PS4 version that launched back in 2018, but its little improvements are definitely nice ones, making this a solid PC port overall. There isn't reason enough here to buy a second copy of the game if you've already played, necessarily, but the PC version is a great reason to check out God of War for the first time for anybody who hasn't had a chance to experience it. God of War remains an excellent, gorgeous, affecting action game, and with the port to PC, it gets a handful of nice, if somewhat minor, improvements.God Of War is featured as one of the best PS5 games.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"
God of War,Chris Plante,Polygon,https://www.polygon.com/2018/4/12/17226486/god-of-war-review-ps4-2018,"Filed under:Dream daddyAbout midway through God of War, Kratos and his son Atreus sit in a canoe in the middle of a lake, listening intently to a disembodied head recount the tawdry and tragic dramas of the Norse gods. The head dishes with the gusto of a gossip columnist and the smoothness of a public radio host. Kratos and son show the orator respect, only interrupting with the occasional question for clarification. That this serene moment doesn’t ring false, let alone veer into tedium, speaks to the tremendous heavy lifting done by the creators of God of War to shift the tone, the style and the expectations of one of the most beloved but also most violent and debaucherous franchises in modern games.Last we saw Kratos, he still enjoyed getting hammered on a bottle of red, participating in a well-lit orgy and slaying Greek gods in ways that a teenager might storyboard onto the back of a ruled notebook. He and his franchise thrived on adrenaline, any inner turmoil serving as a springboard for ultraviolence, rather than an emotional well to be drawn from. Times change, and the new God of War, part sequel (the story continues from where it left off) and part reboot (the adventure is slower and the characterization more thoughtful), has more heroic ambitions for the notorious antihero.Polygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences.

If you want curated lists of our favorite media, check out What to Play and What to Watch.Kratos is a parent now, older, calmer and from what I can tell, into the tiny home fad. He’s taken part in an ancient form of witness protection by moving north and living in a modest cabin in the forests of the Norse realm of Midgard. Kratos is, however, no less a magnet for domestic tragedy. His second wife, the mother to his son Atreus, has just died and been cremated. And so, this particular adventure, at the outset at least, has Kratos and his tween on a quest to fulfill her final wish: that her ashes be carried to the highest peak in the realm. (Yes, the game kicks off with a spin on the “woman in the fridge,” but mercifully, things become more complicated as the story unpacks itself.)The gods and the past get in the way of good intentions, and rather quickly, Kratos and his son find themselves vivisecting undead soldiers, elves, trolls, ancients, and a number of other mythological creatures with silly names and even siller characteristics (e.g., the tatzelwurm, a poison-spitting, tunnel-burrowing walrus-tiger hybrid). Thank goodness. For all the changes to tone and ethos, this is still a God of War game, and you can feel that in the joy of the combat. Kratos doesn’t punch; he pulverizes. He moves like a boxer, shoulders set, legs grapevining back and forth. The way his ax zips into an enemy’s skull, then back to his hand, is so smooth and natural that it’s easy to overlook how challenging it must have been to animate such a thing. (Fortunately, animation director Kristjan Zadziuk explains how the developers likely did it in this YouTube video.)In the early hours, God of War feels, if not like a follow-up to the original game, then a creative revamping. As the 2005 God of War took the individual great combat ideas from its time and blended them together, so does the new God of War for a new era. But the game doesn’t set into any style for too long. Without warning, the linear adventure, focused on fights and dramatic showdowns, bursts wide open, and the preset paths of past entries give way to a new, grand hub, its spokes taking the crew far beyond Midgard. The main objective must be attended to, sure, but not now, not necessarily. Kratos’ goal has weight, but the world isn’t literally rotating around his every decision — an increasingly common and welcome change in AAA blockbusters. This relaxed pace frees you to explore, and it frees Kratos to focus more on parenting than on saving the planet. On more than one occasion, he threatens a bratty Atreus that he will turn this canoe around and head straight back home, and it feels like he might actually do it.In this way, the game has less in common with Homer’s epic Odyssey than with last year’s memoir An Odyssey by Daniel Mendelsohn, which serves as a rich, therapeutic and exploratory look at the author’s relationship with his father through the lens of the classical text. And like that book, God of War does it with wit and grace. The dialogue doesn’t put on a faux-Shakespearean haughtiness. Atreus talks like a kid, sweet and also selfish. And Kratos acts, in turn, like a father who has no clue how to be a parent, and yet feels a profound need to protect this boy from the world and his own bloodline. God of War is awesome at times, in the true sense of the word, but its heart lives in the small ways this man and this boy are building and unbuilding their relationship. All of which is to say that the game is relaxed to the point of bordering on indifferent. Many of God of War’s most interesting surprises are optional, branching from the game’s sturdy throughline: secret rooms giving way to hidden caverns winding to towering statues or belligerent dragons — which I would have missed altogether had I just followed my compass to the next objective. You don’t find collectibles; you find entire chunks of story tucked behind a mossy wall or under a tropical island. God of War, like last year’s Nier: Automata and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, rewards the player who inspects its immaculately designed world as if it were a hidden object game. Also optional are the spoken tales I mentioned earlier, the ones told by the disembodied head. Whenever you step from the canoe onto dry land, the head hushes up, and like a courteous tour guide, promises to eventually pick up his yarns where he left off. I got the most enjoyment from letting him finish, though. This applies to everybody Kratos meets during the journey. I encourage you to hang in the water. Lounge around the shops. Don’t rush into battle when characters are speaking to you. Set down the controller, take in the scenery and listen to what they have to say.By journey’s end, of course, the fate of the world is at play — baby, bathwater — at which point God of War is thoroughly spiced with the gristle of Game of Thrones. Ice zombies, a skeuomorphic tabletop map, some occasionally stilted dialogue about the history of powerful family legacies that had hitherto been mentioned only in passing. The game’s one glaring weakness is this occasional mimicry of the iconography established by George R.R. Martin and his fantasy forebears. The art design excels when it tries something different, such as the buglike dark elves and ghastly white elves, neither of which look like elvish cliches.The rare riff on other fantasy epics would be more bothersome if the game didn’t so confidently hold its own alongside its contemporaries when it comes to sheer scale. I’m hesitant to call the biggest moments in God of War setpieces, since they don’t operate in the fashion setpieces normally would. Some involve heavily choreographed fights and gargantuan explosions. Others, however, make Kratos a diminutive object in the frame, like when he’s dwarfed by a sea serpent that, coiled, must be the size of a small city. One of the most memorable moments has Kratos (with the player maintaining control) parting a lake, creating long chasms of waterfalls that extend into the horizon. No blood or guts, just beauty.These visuals don’t boil down to glorified matte paintings. Unlike in other action games, where spectacle happens around the hero while they fight inside a controlled arena, Kratos and Atreus step into these dense backgrounds. That massive lane in the lake becomes a pathway to an elven kingdom, filled with fights and puzzles. The giant serpent rests languidly around the world’s central hub. And the camera never cuts away. There are no load screens. From the opening frame, through the credits and beyond, the camera lingers behind Kratos, the story proceeding in real time. God of War takes place in one shot.The unedited long take is a bit stress-inducing, at least at first, like watching a movie and not being allowed to blink. But as the game established its more chill pace, I appreciated the refusal to cut away from Kratos and company. I felt more like a participant in the world, rather than someone watching the adventure from outside it. As a technical achievement, the single shot is mind-bending, a never-ending “how did they pull this off?” Open-world sequences seamlessly transition into cinematic showdowns into lengthy trips in the canoe — without a stutter. Because the game can’t cut away, or skip ahead in time or space, you must follow Kratos on every step from one location to the next. As a result of the decision, the world is big and condensed all at the same time. There’s a lot to see, but God of War’s designers have been creative in how they minimize backtracking. Generally, you can see where you’re going or where you came from, as paths through castles and cliffsides have you doubling back, creating shortcuts or secret passages back to the main route. (You eventually gain access to a tool that makes travel simpler and faster, all without breaking the game’s single long camera take. It’s neat.)It sounds Dark Souls-ish because it is Dark Souls-ish. That comparison extends to the combat, which — especially in the extremely difficult postgame content — does a good (if imperfect) impression of everybody’s favorite masocore series. Borrowed inspiration isn’t limited to the Souls franchise. Fights involve an unusual but effective hodgepodge of genres: Ax melee attacks handle like an old-fashioned beat-’em-up; ax throws work like a sniper rifle, the weapon returning to Kratos with the tap of a button; Atreus (whom you can command to fire arrows) behaves almost like an RPG party member, flanking large enemies and stunning packs into position for attacks.In fact, God of War takes a good deal from role-playing games. Gear can be purchased or found, then upgraded or modified, to increase Kratos’ status, which is displayed on the pause screen like a tabletop character sheet. The ax, the shield and the bow have upgrade trees. Kratos’ fanciest attacks are called runics, and you assign one light and one heavy runic attack at a time. Runic attacks replace complex combos, and are performed with a simple tap of the shoulder buttons. No pressure to master reflexes and motor skills. Instead, precious brain juice can be spent on strategy: Does a zone call for attacks that stun large groups of enemies, setting up a sequence of brutal takedowns, or does a big boss warrant narrow but powerful damage-dealing blows? Tough battles are made easy when treated like puzzles to be solved with the right combat approach.None of this is explicitly clarified by the game, nor does it need to be. You won’t see tutorials, just small reminders of which button corresponds to which move. God of War embraces a certain degree of ambiguity, freeing the player to discover their own methods, and tackle the journey how they see fit. Same goes for the story. Kratos and Atreus’ quest takes them in and out of the dramas of other people and kingdoms, and their involvement isn’t clearly rationalized as good or bad. Early in the game, Kratos tells Atreus a tale of sailors who drank seawater and believed they heard the call of their families, the voices both pleasing them and driving them mad. It’s a brief moment, but it subtly establishes a distrust of one’s perception that’s reflected and refracted by the central storyline.This ambiguity works because it’s intentional, not a byproduct of poor storytelling. Even small details pay off. Brief anecdotes parallel core themes. Seemingly inconsequential decisions have major repercussions. Like the game’s world, the story folds in on itself, inviting you to re-examine where you’ve been and reconsider where you’re going. There’s a musicality to the structure: The central hub that Kratos and Atreus visit between adventures acts like a chorus, with each spoke of their journey its own verse. Atreus and other characters gently guide the player toward priorities, though they just as often mention a bundle of side quests that are just as worthy of your time. Simple chatter usually has a purpose, either moving the story forward, or nudging you, wittingly or unwittingly, in a new direction.I’ll skip spoilers and specifics, but even core mechanical design choices, things that seem gamey and intangible, are given narrative purpose by the end. God of War is, in a single word, holistic. Every aspect is excellent on its own, but more importantly, it all serves and accentuates the larger vision.A decade ago, director Cory Barlog helped establish the God of War franchise as an iconic gory and debaucherous video game romp. While its antihero, Kratos, had pathos (he killed his wife and daughter in a fit of rage, his skin forever grayed by their ashes), it served little dramatic purpose, rather existing as a grimdark excuse for his god-slaying and orgy-having ways. Barlog — now older, a father — has returned to the series with a small army of talented designers, many of whom served on the earlier games, to make good on that rich but neglected potential at the francises’ core. There’s still plenty of gore, but now the guts have meatiness. Some die-hard fans may fear this isn’t really God of War. I suppose they’re right. It’s even better. God of War was reviewed using a final “retail” PlayStation 4 download code provided by Sony. You can find additional information about Polygon’s ethics policy here. The game was played on a PS4 Pro on Performance mode. For PS4 Pro users, God of War offers a display mode with 4K resolution, but it had frame-rate issues in our tests. The game was also tested by the Polygon team on a standard PS4 and exhibited no major performance issues.

Not due to quality issues (that year’s God of War III and Ghost of Sparta were critically acclaimed), but because it seemed that there was no place else to go. Kratos’ quest for revenge had led him on a rampage through the pantheon of Greek gods and culminated with the death of his father Zeus. We had performed hundreds of QTEs, killed dozens of gods in the grisliest of manners, and heard plenty of angry Kratos screams. We were done.When Ascension was announced a few years later, you could almost hear the collective groan from the gaming world. It was yet another prequel, it didn’t introduce much in the way of new gameplay, and Sony confusingly led its marketing with a multiplayer mode that no one was asking for. It wasn’t a trainwreck of a game, but it was far from eventful and didn’t necessitate the return of the neatly tied-up series.At E3 2016, we saw our first glimpse of yet another return to God of War. Unlike Ascension, this reveal felt like far more of a departure from the franchise’s past. Kratos wasn’t screaming at the heavens or tearing a minotaur’s horn off and using it to disembowel him. Rather, the nearly ten-minute trailer focused more on dialogue between the protagonist and an as-yet-unknown son.I was excited about the prospect of taking God of War in a new direction, but I also wondered if I’d enjoy it as much. I had always loved the over-the-top brutality in the same way that I enjoyed Mortal Kombat’s cartoonish fatalities. My favorite moments included beating Zeus to death until the screen was covered in blood, tearing the massive fingernail off of a titan, and in perhaps my favorite moment in the series, slamming a metal door onto the head of Theseus for way too long. God of War was a hilarious, over-the-top, violent revenge story, and I loved it for that. I worried that a more “mature” take on the series would be like remaking Commando with an emphasis on the relationship between Col. Matrix and Jenny instead of an emphasis on rowing a boat up to an island and killing tons of bad guys.Of course, God of War wouldn’t have seen the massive success it enjoyed if it were based solely on blood and guts. Rock-solid gameplay ensured that it was more than a one-trick pony, so I hoped this PS4 reboot would satisfy on the gameplay front even if the “screaming and killing” tone had changed.The games of the original trilogy began by impaling the head of a Hydra on the mast of a ship, destroying a rampaging colossus from the inside, and poking out Poseidon’s eyes and throwing him off a cliff. By contrast, Kratos spends most of his time in the early hours of the new game by chatting with his young son. Compared to the seemingly intentional lack of nuance in the series’ past, it’s handled extremely well this time around. Kratos is no longer a screaming avatar of rage that expresses himself via quicktime event. He’s older and sadder, with a quest of fulfilling a loved one’s dying wish instead of exacting vengeance on every god that crosses his path.At the outset, he seems to be simultaneously preparing his son Atreus for a life as a warrior while also trying to steer him away from the path he took for himself. He’s harsh and humorless in the face of Atreus’ childlike playfulness and inquisitive nature. If the topic of conversation isn’t about focusing in combat or removing emotion from killing, Kratos seems to have no time for it.If this were the tone for the entire game, it could quickly become tiresome. Thankfully, this new world (set in Nordic mythology for the first time) is populated with plenty of characters that aren’t amused or intimidated by Kratos’ gruffness. There are several new characters (including Atreus) who call him out on his attitude or poke fun at how much of a ridiculous grump he is, and he never really seems to know how to respond.We spend several hours getting accustomed to the new world, characters, mythology, and father/son dynamic. These hours aren’t without the occasional skirmish, so you’ll also have some time to get accustomed to the new over-the-shoulder camera and completely overhauled combat system. The new perspective and Kratos’ Leviathan axe instantly feel more deliberate than the iconic, crowd-clearing Blades of Chaos. Your abilities are limited in use early on, with little to do other than light and heavy swings, bare-handed attacks, blocking with your shield, throwing the axe (with a boomerang-like return), and commanding Atreus to fire his bow in the general direction of the camera’s view.Combat has changed in more fundamental ways than “it’s over-the-shoulder and you have a kid now.” Rather than the face button-centric combat of the past, the majority of attacks are now handled via some combination of the triggers. Instead of a directional evade controlled by the right analog stick, you can now block (or parry) with L1 or roll out of the way by double-tapping X. It takes some time to get used to and I found myself messing up for many hours before I acclimated myself to the new system. Once everything clicks into place and you’ve earned some upgrades, combat feels as intense and responsive as ever.I felt limited in my axe attacks in the early hours, but your combat capabilities continuously evolve over the course of the game. By the end, I was utilizing my weapons, bare-handed techniques, two special Runic attacks, a talisman ability, a rage meter, tons of unlocked combos, and numerous Atreus abilities to control and defeat large groups of enemies. Once you know what you’re doing and you have plenty of moves at your disposal, combat becomes more satisfying than the mash-friendly encounters of the past.Atreus is just as critical to combat as he is to the game’s story. You can use him to pull enemy attention and deal damage via his arrow attacks, and it never feels like he’s in the way or requires babysitting. It’s an even-better implementation of a companion than Ellie in The Last of Us. While she didn’t require a lot of protection either, she’d sometimes break immersion by running around in plain sight during a stealth sequence. That isn’t an issue in God of War, as Atreus fits in perfectly at all times, whether it’s a combat encounter or a father/son chat while rowing across the Lake of Nine.Hopping into that boat with Atreus is the first real taste of just how open and different the format is this time around. Previous God of War titles were strictly linear, with only the occasional branch off the main path (almost always to find a hidden chest). A story objective is clearly marked once you reach the lake, but it’s immediately clear that you’re free to explore at your leisure. The Lake of Nine almost feels like Hyrule Field in a 3D Zelda game, serving as a central hub that connects a wide variety of smaller locales and challenges. Between almost every story beat, I loved sailing around to side areas to see what I could find. More often than not, my exploration would be rewarded in the form of side stories, clever puzzles, hidden collectibles, or new gear.I was initially excited about the prospect of a robust customization system in a God of War game, but it doesn’t quite work as well as I hoped. You can discover and craft a wide variety of armor, talismans, axe pommels, runes, and more, but everything from the interface to the inventory management feels a bit half-baked. New crafting materials are constantly being thrown at you (especially late in the game) with little explanation of what they’re for. A “resources” tab in the menu doesn’t always clear things up, such as when I started finding things like Symbols of Perseverance in treasure chests but no mention of them anywhere else in the game.Some materials are tied to rare enemies, so I had no idea if their supply was inherently limited or if the necessary enemies would respawn at a later time. I also found little reason to change out gear or runic abilities unless it was for a significant, obvious step up in rarity. Once I found something I liked, I’d funnel tons of materials and currency into upgrading it. I’d eventually find some new base-level gear or ability, but I’d already be so invested in whatever I was currently using that I wouldn’t want to start the process again with something that was untested.God of War’s first gear system doesn’t knock it out of the park, but it’s at least cool to see new armor represented visually on Kratos. Each element of this game’s visual design is impeccable, melding the stunning scenery the earlier titles were known for with technical brilliance that rivals the best we’ve seen from Naughty Dog. Titles like Uncharted: Lost Legacy and Horizon: Zero Dawn have made great cases for a PS4 Pro and a 4K television, but God of War’s visuals are a bigger selling point than anything I’ve seen on Sony’s platform to date. Dark caverns and blinding ethereal locations make great use of HDR, and the art design of the various environments is bound to look amazing regardless of what you’re playing on.I was excited for a new take on God of War, but I don’t think I could have expected what Sony Santa Monica pulled off with this one. Those first three games are among my favorite games of the 2000s thanks to their visceral combat, stunning environments, grand scale, satisfying upgrades, and memorable boss fights. I even loved the skin deep, silly nature of its narrative and violence. This new entry proves that it can provide all of the positive qualities of the franchise’s past while expanding on and evolving them in every conceivable way. The new combat system is excellent, the numerous puzzles are clever and rewarding, a more open format gives you plenty of reason to explore, and the entire adventure is at least three times longer than any of the original games without ever feeling padded out.Perhaps most importantly, I didn’t know how much more ground could be covered with Kratos as a character. The new Nordic mythology obviously gives Sony Santa Monica plenty of new material to play with, but it’s the new Kratos that’s responsible for the game’s most striking evolution. I’ve played through five God of War games as this character, and never saw him as much more than “the tough screamy guy that’s gonna kill all these gods in hilarious ways.” Now, I find myself just as invested in the quiet conversations Kratos has with Atreus as I do with my newest weapon upgrade. God of War grew up, and the result is the best entry in the series.The CHAMP and Jan are here to deliver news on The Last of Us Part 1 PC port, EA layoffs, PSVR2 reports, and more!© 2023 GIANT BOMB, A FANDOM COMPANY.

God of War,Mike Williams,USgamer,http://www.usgamer.net/articles/god-of-war-review,"There’s a scene in God of War where Kratos decapitates someone to free them from a magical cage within the mangled roots of a tree. The original games would have relished in the act, pulling the camera close for each grisly axe swing, zooming in as the tendons snap back like stretched elastic bands. In God of War 2018, the camera pans away instead, and the act itself takes just one clean cut. The pantheon-punching God of War series has always been as subtle as a demigod’s boot to the face, but this sequel has more class, more confidence than ever. It allows things to go unseen or unsaid. In one early cutscene, Kratos’s wrist bandages untangle. He stares down at the dangling cloth as his hand instinctively tries to catch some invisible hilt, grasping at nothing. There’s no flashback to explain what he is thinking - everything you need to know is right there in his face: he has left the Ghost of Sparta, and the Blades of Chaos, behind. We join Kratos in the frozen, craggy land of Norse mythology, a place ruled over by deities Odin and Thor. He did not come here to carve up the gods, however. No. He came here to start a new life - a new life as a man. The adventure begins with the funeral of Kratos’s wife, shortly before he and his son, Atreus, take a journey to the tallest peak in all the realms to scatter her ashes. Rather than kicking off with a massive boss fight - though you punch someone through a mountain within an hour - God of War 2018 begins with a slow walk. 
 
This is a story about the sins of the father - a central theme wrapped around the experience like a flaming chain and mirrored in the characters you meet. God of War has always been thematically consistent, but rage is not the sole driving force here. Kratos is still a sullen slaphead whose brain is probably made of a bicep (he punches certain chests - treasure chests, not pectorals - open for Christ’s sake). He is also still a brutally efficient murderer who moisturises his ashen skin with the blood of his foes. Kratos is just more world-weary, mindful of the consequences of his Greek revenge spree, and now he has something to lose. ""The pantheon-punching God of War series has always been as subtle as a demigod’s boot to the face, but this sequel has more class, more confidence than ever.""Just as there’s a steadfast commitment to its themes, God of War is unmoving in its style. It is filmed in a single shot, the camera dancing in and out of the action with no visible loading between areas. There is a trade-off - it means that you can never see what is happening off-screen - but it all comes together to make the journey feel more personal. You have to admire Sony Santa Monica’s devotion to such a novel artistic choice. During cutscenes that seamlessly transition between exploration and combat, the camera dollies out or becomes a drone that hovers around the action, swooping in and following the carnage. When you are in control, the camera hugs Kratos’s back, allowing you to look around freely - unlike in the older games where fixed camera angles amped up the drama of your grandiose surroundings, often reducing Kratos to a spec against the environment. If anything, the fact you have to angle the camera up to take in some of the game’s huge creatures and ornate contraptions makes everything seem grander still.  
 
Kicking a dragon in the face is just best experienced up-close, you know? As for the violence itself, combat is comfortably familiar despite the change of perspective. You have a light and heavy attack - though now they are on R1 and R2 - and you can mix them together to create combos, or pause between attacks to switch stances and perform different strikes, once unlocked. Stagger an enemy and you can perform a grisly and satisfying execution with R3. For incoming attacks, you can dodge, guard, or - with the right timing - parry. Fill up your rage meter and you go into a fury and pound your enemies to a pulp while recovering health with successful strikes. The main difference is your toolkit. Your primary weapon (others come later) is an ice axe capable of freezing enemies or mechanisms in place. Squeeze L2 and it functions like a gun in a third-person shooter, allowing you to fling it at speed and bury it into an enemy’s face or a part of the environment - this is useful in both combat and puzzles. When the axe is out of your hands, you fight with your fists, feet, and a shield. Tap triangle at any time and the axe whizzes through the air like Thor’s hammer, hitting any enemies it passes through on its return to your hand where it lands with a lovely clunk. Yes, it is as cool as it sounds. No, it never gets old. ""Sitting alongside the snappy and at times genuinely funny dialogue are the ridiculous, bombastic set-pieces you expect from a God of War game. ""Atreus also helps out in combat, grabbing enemies by the neck and holding them in place, loosing volleys of arrows at your command, or summoning spectral animals to trample on your foes. Combat isn’t as deep as some action games, but there’s a real heft to every attack as Kratos spins like a hurricane that just swept through a knife shop, and new abilities unlock at a rapid rate.  
 
As well as pulling his weight in battles, Atreus acts as a cipher for the player’s curiosity. He has spent his entire life squirrelled away in a shack in the woods, and now he’s seeing the land of Norse mythology with fresh eyes, just as you are. As you row between islands or explore on foot, the father and son pair chat (well, Kratos grunts) about your goals. Atreus is happy to go off and explore, while Kratos is concerned only with your quest and making sure Atreus doesn’t develop his father’s temper and go all dad-stabby. Other than one clumsy bit of character development in the final third, the writing is excellent. Atreus is in awe of his father, a burly baldy who can flip an entire temple upside down with his hands, while Kratos himself treats Atreus as a student, rather than a son. Their relationship matures over the 20-odd hours the main story takes to complete, and both are different people by the time the credits roll. The same goes for the supporting cast, who are trying to reconcile their own family bonds. Sitting alongside the snappy and at times genuinely funny dialogue are the ridiculous, bombastic set-pieces you expect from a God of War game. I won’t spoil them, but there are moments here that rival God of War 3’s opening scene, only now they have something to contrast against - the moments of downtime make these wonderfully choreographed action sequences and environmental oddities really stand out.  
 
God of War comes with all the trappings of a video game released in 2018, letting you loose into a small open-world, filling it with sidequests, and layering it in light RPG elements, but it’s such a beautiful, awe-inspiring landscape that even simply exploring is enjoyable. Sony Santa Monica makes great use of the space, too, opening up new areas with dropping water levels, or allowing you to discover looping shortcuts, so there always feels like there is something new to discover when you want a distraction from your main quest.Partway through the game, you get access to a teleporting machine that allows you to access other realms, opening up the world even more. My only real criticism is how that contraption promises more than it delivers. A handful of the realms are locked throughout - presumably put aside for DLC - while two of them are essentially fighting arenas, distractions where you can battle to grab legendary loot. Only two of the other realms contain a ‘proper’ new landscape to explore. Still, it’s a credit to the quality of what is there that I didn’t want to leave its world after the credits rolled and instantly headed back into the world to punch werewolves again. God of War has grown up. It is violent, but it’s not excessive. It is angry, but there is something to contrast it against. There is a flash of nipple, but it’s Kratos’s. Kratos is older, and he feels remorse for his past, but it feels like Sony Santa Monica also wants to atone. If that was God of War’s goal, the studio deserves a standing ovation. This isn’t only the best God of War game, it’s one of the best games of the current generation. You're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!

Almost every console has a defining game, one that comes to mind whenever you think about the platform. These are the Marios and Halos of the video game world, the exclusive games that sell systems. While no one could argue that the PlayStation 4 doesn’t have a sizable collection of quality exclusives, its library has been missing that magical title that makes gamers everywhere pause in reflection. A game that transcends all fan bases and attracts aficionados of any genre.Well, that game is finally here. God of War (2018) is an amalgam of the best of everything PS4 has to offer to this point. It perfects current-gen gameplay conventions and introduces it’s own twists that we’ll see replicated in games for years to come. God of War is the Breath of the Wild of the PS4, and it’s joined the handful or so of exclusive titles that alone are worth the price of the console.SIE Santa Monica has crafted an utterly amazing world in God of War. Part of this is because it’s rooted in Norse mythology and has a vast pool of legends to draw from. Sometime after God of War 3, Kratos pulled up his stakes and moved from Greece to Midgard. Instead of Zeus, Athena, and pals, Kratos now has to worry about the likes of Odin, Thor, and Baldur.However, instead of leaning entirely on the old tales, the writers have taken liberties with the legends here and there to weave the story of Kratos and his son Atreus into Norse mythology in a way that makes it feel as though they were always there. Additionally, SIE Santa Monica made this game with the idea in mind that those who have never played a God of War game can enjoy and understand it just as well as someone who has played all of them. It’s sort of a soft reboot (thus the God of War moniker instead of God of War 4) in that it doesn’t rely heavily on previous knowledge of the series, but longtime fans of the series will enjoy the references to previous events in Kratos’ life..The game begins with Kratos cremating the remains of his wife, Faye. Faye’s last wish was to have her ashes scattered from the highest mountain in all the realms. Sad, but a pretty simple objective, right? Unfortunately, Kratos may have run from Greece, but he can’t run from his godhood, and there are plenty of people in the Norse realms that aren’t particularly happy about a stray god traipsing about.At center stage in the game is Kratos’ relationship with his son. Kratos was a terrible father in Greece, and he didn’t do a much better job in Midgard. His relationship with Atreus is strained at best, and without Faye to stand as a medium between them they’re forced to directly interact with each other for an extended period for the first time.The two’s journey together is a struggle in multiple ways. Dealing with the loss of a wife and mother is hard enough on its own, but their histories make the going even tougher. Kratos, though older and wiser, still has a lot of difficulty with the concept of family. Not only did he kill his family due to Ares’ trickery, but his relationship with his own father and mother, Zeus and Callisto, was far from healthy. Because of Kratos standoffish demeanor, Atreus struggles to feel accepted by his father and doesn’t think he’ll ever be strong enough to make him proud.Watching the two grow throughout their journey is incredibly rewarding, and measures up with pairings such as Ellie and Joel or Lee and Clementine. The writing and acting bring out the bond between father and son and drive home the moments when it’s strengthened or strained. Atreus, while mature for his age, is still a young boy and watching Kratos teach him how to be a man, and how the world works is heartwrenching. Though you control Kratos, both he and Atreus are the main characters of the game, and part of what makes God of War so great is the fact that you’re made an audience to their struggles. Neither of them is an avatar for the player; this is their story and not a choose-your-own-adventure game.Just because you want Kratos or Atreus to do something doesn’t mean it’s going to happen. They do things according to their own personalities, regardless of how bad an idea it is. Some might be turned off by this “lack of player agency,” but I think that’s rubbish. After all the sandbox, open-world games that get released, I’m always thrilled to play a game with a strong lead role instead of some nameless protagonist making shallow, insignificant decisions.Instead, everything in God of War makes sense in the context of the world it takes place in. Almost nothing remains unexplained, down to fast travel and why the dwarven shopkeepers can be everywhere at once. Some games would suffer greatly by taking player choice out of the equation, but by closing the world to direct player influence, God of War is able to weave a fantastic plot and build an incredible world without having to worry about what’s going to happen if you randomly kill an NPC.Just because the plot of God of War is linear though, doesn’t mean there’s not exploration and open-world design. At key parts during the game, you’ll get the opportunity to break aware from the main quest for a while and explore Midgard and some of the other Norse realms.The great thing about the exploration in God of War is that you can participate in it as little or as much as you want. There are tens of hours of optional exploring and side questing you can do that will reward you with powerful armor and enhancements along with a ton of lore and backstory about the world you’re in. If you’re just interested in the story though, you can stay on the path and move on.An excellent design decision in God of War is that during many main plot points the game keeps you on task. If you need to hurry somewhere, the game locks you into that course of action so you won’t get distracted. This allows God of War to have the best of both worlds: an urgent and linear main quest and plenty of open-world exploration and side quests if you so choose.The pacing of how the world is revealed is excellent in God of War. At first, you don’t even have a compass. The game makes you figure out the basics without assistance and gradually introduces mechanics before doing so becomes cumbersome or irritating.Fast travel too, isn’t available from the start, and for most of the game, you can only fast travel to one centrally located area. As a result, you have to actually traverse the world on foot and by boat and take it all in instead of going to a menu and changing location every five minutes and waiting for a loading screen. Some players may find this irritating, but I really enjoyed how it set the pace for most of the game, and by the end, I felt like I had been on a real journey because of it.The pace of exploration is kept nicely as well. There are key events in the game that open up new areas to explore and new ways to get past certain obstacles. This means that you might complete exploring most of an area early in the game, but not have the means to open a door or create a path to the last part of that area until late in the game. This kind of keeps you filled with a sense of anticipation, wondering, “when will I get to see what’s behind that door?”Midgard is by far the largest area to explore, and where most of the game takes place, but you’ll gain access to five other realms as well. The Norse realms exist layered on top of one another, so each one is a different version of the other eight. This means that some are filled with cold winds while others are teaming with magma and spewing molten rock. All of these changes in scenery look amazing on the PS4, and with 4K and HDR this game goes a step beyond what even games like Horizon Zero Dawn showed us was possible on this platform.Beyond crisp resolution and stunning HDR colors though are the incredibly detailed textures. Your journey takes you through a lot of different environments, and the texture work in God of War really brings them to life. As I was playing through the main quest, I didn’t notice it so much, but as I was going back and completing the side quests and exploration I hadn’t finished yet, I took the time to really look at the scenery.Run-of-the-mill environmental aspects like dirt, water, and snow all look great, but it’s the buildings and statues that show how much love SIE Santa Monica put into this game. You’ll see temples with golden decor all about, all engraved with ridiculously intricate scrollwork and runes. The detail throughout the game is consistent and astounding, and even the most inconsequential areas seem to have had special care taken with them.Somehow the God of War displays all these visuals without any loading screens in-between areas. After the initial game load, you’ll never have a big black screen take you out of the action. Of course, this is mostly due to some clever programming tricks. Instead of a loading screen, you may have to paddle your boat through a narrow tunnel to the next area or wait for a piece of enchanted machinery to cycle.However, I’d much rather remain in control of a character, even if it means you’re just doing something mundane like riding an elevator. These disguised loading periods are also often punctuated by conversations between Kratos and Atreus about the state of the world or Kratos’ past. It gives a chance for some exposition during a time most games would just have a loading screen displayed, and keeps your head in the game instead of sighing and waiting for the next opportunity to play.There are plenty of undead (and living) foes that stand between Atreus and Kratos’ objective. The God of War games are known for their hack-and-slash gameplay, but this time around things are a bit more measured.Most of the control in the game is over Kratos, though you can also call on Atreus to assist you with his bow. Kratos’ starting weapon is the Leviathan Axe, which works a lot like Mjolnir. You can throw it and have it instantly fly back into Kratos’ hands. You’ll also have access to a retractable shield and, of course, Kratos’ fists.The combat in this game is similar to Horizon Zero Dawn, though it tends to play out fast and against more numerous and more powerful foes than that game. Enemies in God of War usually have two meters: health and stun. While the most straightforward way to kill an enemy is to drain their health to zero, you can also stun them with specific attacks. If you manage to fill the stun gauge enough to daze an enemy, Kratos can attack them for massive damage.The interplay between Kratos ax, fists, and shield, and Atreus’ bow makes for an impressive fighting system, one that when mastered will have you truly performing godlike acts of martial skill on-screen. Throwing your ax into a far-off Draugr for the kill, then stunning a nearby one and ripping it in half before calling back your ax to carve through a third enemy looks amazing and gives you a real feeling of power.As you continue through the game, both Kratos and Atreus gain new skills that add to the utility of their weapons. Kratos starts the game with some basic moves and the ability to throw his ax. However, by the time you reach the end, you’ll have acquired extra techniques that allow you to chain together devastating combos. If you put some time into learning the different combinations of attacks, you can eventually get to the point where most enemies can’t even touch you as you pull off infinite combos that kill just about anything that gets near.At the beginning of God of War, you’ll likely find one or two enemies difficult to take on, but there’s plenty of equipment to locate and craft that feeds into the games stat system. For the most part, an item’s power is dictated by its rarity, with Epic gear being the best.However, sometimes you’ll be better off wearing an upgraded piece of lower-tier gear than a fresh piece of Epic gear. There are also enchantments that bestow bonus effects when socketed into armor and weapons that give you beneficial effects like increased sprint speed or resistance to burn damage.Crafting new armor and enhancement items is a big part of why exploration and side quests in God of War are important. For going out of your way, you’ll often get access to a new item or crafting ingredients which will give you a mighty boost over what you’re currently wearing or let you upgrade your current equipment even further. Though like I said above, you can altogether skip out on all of this. The game rewards you with enough armor and enchantments as you play through that you can forgo the crafting system if you want.Unfortunately, God of War shares some of the issues that other third-person action games do. In fact, these problems are so widespread that I didn’t even end up counting them against this game in particular.During combat, it can be difficult to control the camera and keep a bead on the enemies you’re fighting. If you’re fighting a large number of foes or a particularly fast one, it’s not hard to lose track of them and take damage that you really shouldn’t have. There’s a lock-on function that helps this somewhat, but I found it a bit too sticky and using it was often more detrimental than helpful.God of War does have among the best controls I’ve seen in a third-person action game, though. Until humans can get a third arm grafted on to control the camera independently or someone comes up with a better controller idea than the standard configuration all three consoles use right now, then this is about as good as it’s going to get.The game has four difficulty settings, and I played on “Give Me a Balanced Experience” which corresponds to the Normal in most games. I found the combat challenging, but fair, and didn’t have an issue making it through most of the game without getting frustrated. I will say some side bosses are absolutely brutal and will try you even with a tricked out Kratos and Atreus.For those that want more of a challenge there’s also “Give Me a Challenge” (hard) and Give Me God of War (very hard), and for those who want a lighter experience, there’s “Give Me a Story (easy). For the first three difficulty modes you can change the difficulty at will, but for the hardest mode, you’re locked in for the duration. The difficulty setting seems to influence enemy AI, health and strength instead of limiting item usage or changing item placement, so it should only really affect how tough combat is.These aren’t the most robust difficulty options I’ve ever seen in a game, but they don’t have to be. Gamers who want a challenge have the opportunity to play through the game in that manner, and those who are in it for the story both should be satisfied with the options presented in God of War. If you want some extra difficulty, or you just don’t want a HUD, there’s an immersive mode available that lets you turn on and off parts of the HUD at will. In fact, it’s entirely possible to play through the whole game with a minimal or no interface.[springboard type=”video” id=”1735565″ player=”ga027″ width=”640″ height=”387″ ]I’ve never given a game a perfect score before, and I thought long and hard about whether or not God of War deserves it. No matter how much I enjoy a game, typically there are at least a few moments where I get frustrated or bored, but not with this one. It’s possibly the best example of what the PS4 has to offer, and I feel like it’s going to be one of those games that instantly comes to mind when they think of this console generation.The graphics, sound, combat, world, and plot all come together to make an exquisite package that is a prime example of why games are art and God of War is right up there with the best films and novels when it comes to storytelling. If you have a PlayStation 4, you should play God of War. If you don’t have one, you should consider getting one to play this game.PS4 digital review copy was provided by the publisher.

God of War,Chris Carter,Destructoid,https://www.destructoid.com/review-god-of-war-ps4--497165.phtml,"darkI was highly skeptical of the soft God of War Norse reboot. I’m always willing to give something a shot, but taking the fast and frenetic combat of the original series and slowing it down to focus on a father and son relationship? It’s a bold and risky move.One that paid off in spades.God of War (PS4)
Developer: SIE Santa Monica Studio
Publisher: Sony Interactive Entertainment
Released: April 20, 2018
MSRP: $59.99With its muted intro of…gathering wood, it’s immediately clear that God of War is moving in a new direction. The pacing, score, and the voicework are a hat tip at the level of effort that Santa Monica put into this labor of love, and can only be described as meticulous. Before you chop your first undead grunt in half, the table is set for a personal journey intertwined with an epic quest. Yes, you actually get both.I’ve jokingly referred to the project as “Dad of War” since it was revealed, but that light ribbing slowly became more of a term of endearment as I wrapped myself around the narrative. Kratos and his son Atreus have a tumultuous relationship at the start, and although you can guess where that setup is going, the way it gets there is organic. Having played every game in the series it’s a little tough for me to truly reconcile Kratos’ new turn from “murderous genocidal asshole” to “stern father,” but some of that history is addressed, and it’s strongly hinted that the rest will make its way into the fold eventually. I’m still wrestling with it.Atreus worms his way into combat and the game’s puzzles, mostly propelled by a square button prompt that initiates actions and commands him to fire arrows at enemies. I’ll be the first to admit that I was wary of the whole familial angle, but Atreus, at his worst at the absolute start of the tale, is merely a smartass. Very quickly he starts to come into his own in a way that doesn’t feel forced, and roughly five hours in he’s a badass in training that starts actively participating in combat with the player. Far too often works in any form of media can screw up the kid angle — but a kid that can summon spirit wolves, talk smack on Kratos, and choke out Norse zombies sure beats the hell out of most video game companions.What starts off as a semi-grounded affair (minus some quick bouts with the undead, a few trolls, and a God) soon gets otherworldly. If the narrative isn’t moving along there’s a subtle level of worldbuilding going on, frequently spouted in sections I call “story time,” when the player is rowing down a stream or walking toward a key destination. The heavy-hitting moments (including one “oh hell yea” scene) are few and far between which is a good thing, as the pacing is even-keeled. Without giving you any details, suffice to say this is not a self-contained story.Progression isn’t chapter-based as the discovery of new areas is seamlessly linked. For the critical path you’re moving from setpiece to setpiece, some of which are labyrinthine caves or quasi-large open zones, and then eventually you trigger a cutscene (which are nicely done with the in-game engine) or leap down from a ledge of no return. But after that individual bit is done, you’re free to come back and explore again, uncovering new secrets, sometimes with items you’ve picked up later in the story. There’s a legitimate endgame here after the credits roll, involving multiple optional areas, challenges, and bosses (the campaign took me roughly 20 hours to best, and I wrapped up every major quest minus a few collectibles in around 35).Shortly into the fray you’ll get a fast-travel item that works at specific doorways. It’s a great compromise because while there is some light bloat (the map constantly reminds you of missed riches and collectibles), it never reaches gargantuan radio tower levels. I’ll refrain from making direct comparisons, but with a bevy of shortcuts there’s a clear amount of From Software influence afoot.Okay but enough about how much God of War strays from the path of the original. Can you still rip apart wolf jaws and juggle fools with combos? Sure! At the start you’ll be kitted out with Kratos’ Leviathan Axe, which can be recalled after thrown and used in basic light/heavy attacks. Eventually you’ll unlock two magic slots, which are basically old combo abilities now tied to a cooldown — and you’ll earn new skills and light combos through experience points.Early on, the limited amount of moves at your disposal aren’t as flashy as you’d expect. Calling back your axe is very cool at first and even offers an additional layer of strategy (it’s incorporated into many puzzles), but it does get old. It would have been a lot more effective of a gimmick if you could recall it while running/jumping and so on to encourage more locomotion; as it stands you have to wait until a late upgrade to recall it quickly, and even then it’s in a limited fashion. In case you’re wondering QTEs are mostly out, with the exception of the occasional circle button mashing during key moments.Your bread and butter is using a heavy attack as a launcher then juggling with light blows, and peppering in arrows from Atreus. A quick tap for a smooth dodge and a double-tap for rolling is a nice touch, and my favorite aspect of combat is micro-managing Atreus while Kratos is animation locked. You can also manipulate your abilities in several cool ways, like linking them to a talisman that resets their cooldowns to create new builds. Despite these nuances, at first, I was worried. Initially, combat is clunkier than you’re used to in a refined God of War. That’s because the original trilogy contains some of the finest action mechanics of the past few decades, and it doesn’t mean that the new PS4 iteration is by any means sub-par.It’s a minor annoyance that you acclimate to after the first incredible boss fight, and more and more as you start to weave in Atreus and your god powers (Rage of the Gods is back), take in the scenery, acquire at least one new weapon, and deal with the runic and progression systems. Oh, God of War has more RPG elements now. Gear can be crafted or purchased after acquiring the appropriate materials, and it has a World of Warcraft rarity level of green, blue, purple, and gold.Kratos can level-up by equipping better gear, and has a full statline that can be min-maxed or evenly spread. It completely depends on what you want your playstyle to be and the kinds of gems you socket. Some of this begets grinding, especially later in the game as you’re scrounging for upgrades, but it’s by no means required to see the end of the tale. As always, swift dodging and a penchant for iFrame (invincibility) windows will get you past all of the game’s challenges.Don’t think that Santa Monica put all of their effort into dialogue and drama, as God of War maintains the same bonkers-level boss fights and setpieces, all of which are presented in the stunning in-game engine that features a hell of a draw distance. Environmental destruction helps give fights scale, and the new engine is constantly trying to push the envelope. I was hanging on by a thread in what feels like nearly every battle, which speaks to the balance team’s talent on a technical level too.A bit of housekeeping, as I know there’s a lot of purists out there: the medium difficulty setting feels pretty on-point, and there’s a hard and very hard setting to mess around with from the start. You can also swap to easy, medium, or hard whenever you want (very hard is a take-it-or-leave-it kind of thing that locks you from changing it).God of War is a different game for a new era of the medium. While I’m a sucker for more frantic arcadey action there are plenty of studios left carrying on that legacy. Unless something catastrophic happens to Sony Santa Monica, there’s more story to tell, and I hope the exact same team is able to tell it.[This review is based on a retail version of the game provided by the publisher.]Flawless10s aren't perfect, since nothing is, but they come as close as you could get in a given genre. The new leader to beat in its sector, we're talking pure ecstasy.

God of War,Dave Thier,Forbes,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2018/04/12/god-of-war-review/#5a6cbf3488a4,"'God of War.'The first enemy you fight in God of War is a tree. Kratos is living as a man now, and that's what he's using his axe for, after all. He's no less angry at it for the fact that it isn't trying to rip his throat out with sharp claws: his wife is dead, and there's no shortage of residual rage from the character who we last saw beating his own father's skull into the ground with his bare hands. But the camera gives us plenty of opportunities to look at his new, haggard face, both here in this first moments and throughout the game: the wrinkles both a sign of his advanced years and the fact that this is his first adventure built for the PlayStation 4's graphical capability. His beard, too, is the game's way of saying that we're in new territory now, a soft reboot for what was once one of PlayStation's core franchises. We're in mythological Scandinavia now, the home of Odin, Thor and the Norse Gods.That's the challenge of God of War, or of any reboot. Fans of the series, of which there are many, want a God of War game. But they want a new one, not a retread of old territory. We need Kratos to be familiar, but not identical, just like the combat, the new setting and the rest of the gameplay. That the world of the Eddas translates well into the series' signature larger-than-life brutality is not surprising: we have Trolls, Jotuns, Elves, Dwarves and vengeful Gods, magic hammers, Sacred Runes and everything else we need to piece together a set piece action RPG. What is surprising, however, is how well it all works, not just the change in setting but the ambitious writing and more involved combat. God of War is not just a true God of War game -- it's an excellent one, and my favorite installment since God of War 2. God of War.A Whole New WorldThe move to Norse Mythology is no less natural for being a move borne out of necessity: there were neither any real stories left to tell in Kratos' Greek life nor any characters left for him to kill. The game doesn't linger on the idea much: this is a shared world where the realms of Greek and Norse mythology both exist more or less separate from each other save this one character that's moved between them, and we're leaving it at that. It works as a vehicle to bring fresh Gods and monsters into our world, and that's sort of enough.The story centers on Kratos and Atreus, his son by a woman named Fey, recently deceased at the beginning of the game. Their journey, like so many of the mythological tales that inspire it, is simple: to scatter her ashes on the highest peak in all the realms. There are some complications along the way, and thus makes the game -- the writing here is more involved than the rest of the series, where Kratos was mostly an avatar of rage and more or less all the other characters were dead within minutes of meeting him. That breakneck pace of violence is a bit slower this time around. Kratos is a character this time, and a surprisingly engaging one: no less savage in combat, but more reluctantly so, worried to keep his child from his same fate -- or the fate of his previous children. Kratos has few examples of functional families in his life.What follows works, in and out of combat: Atreus is wide-eyed and excitable, a foil for his father's gruff, world-weary stoicism. Atreus asks him questions, Kratos responds with what becomes a sort of catchphrase: ""I do not know."" The two become endearing, a camera to begin this early exploration of a new world. And the world is different: there is nothing like the glittering, towering temples of the original series, and something about that grandeur is missed. But things are smaller and colder this time around, a little more human to match Kratos' now-fleshed-out character. As in the past, there is no lack of the large scale in this game. But there's also a small scale that's never been present before. We'll talk about the camera in the next section, how the close-in angle changes the way combat works. But it matters to the story, too: everything is that much more intimate.It feels a little like God of War by way of Uncharted, with the sort of two-character writing that keeps dialogue rolling through what would otherwise be a solitary adventure. There is even a bit of comedy here, especially when you pick up a new companion along the way. Kratos -- yes, Kratos -- actually has a few lines which could be roughly interpreted as jokes, a very new role for the Ghost of Sparta. At one point, a character discussing the nine realms of the world asks him if he's ever been to hell.""Not this one,"" he responds.God of War.Bringing it in CloseJust like the Blades of Chaos defined the area-controlling, flaming menace of the original series, so the new Leviathan Axe defines most of this one. It's a nimble weapon but a heavy one, which is essentially how combat feels here: Kratos isn't exactly difficult to move around, but he's less acrobatic than he was in his earlier years. That's thanks it most part to the close-in camera, behind-the-shoulder camera, which makes the whole experience more intimate and weightier, bringing us right up to a distance that was mostly reserved for cinematic moments before. Just like the story feels like God of War by way of Uncharted, the combat feels like God of War by way of that old touchstone Dark Souls: we get the physicality, camera and impact of a Souls game combined with the ferocity and power of a God of War game.Kratos is a little more versatile this time around, however. To start with, the Leviathan Axe can also be thrown, adding in a much more involved layer of ranged capabilities both in combat and when solving environmental puzzles -- Kratos can recall it with Triangle and it whooshes back with a satisfying thud every time. That throwing gives options in combat that the game didn't have before, and it allows for a lot more variety in playstyles. Kratos can also opt to go bare-handed, a satisfying way to lay stun damage down on an enemy until you can trigger one of the series' signature executions -- sans button prompts, thankfully. The combination of a shield and some more elaborate high-level moves allow for a strong power fantasy associated with mastering the wealth of options on offer.Things are more disorienting when you can't see enemies behind you, which can be frustrating when you're mobbed. That's mitigated by both a wider range of magic attacks, as well as UI warnings and Atreus, who will warn you when you're getting attacked from a blind spot. The kid had people worried that the game was going to be one long escort mission, but both solid writing and clever combat implementation help avoid that entirely: if anything, his arrows are a little bit overpowered, something which helps endear him to the player in and out of combat. There's far more to keep track of than in older games, and it can be a bit much at times. Still, if you can keep it all straight in your head, it's massively satisfying to pull off some of the games' more elaborate executions.There are also customization options to be had -- a lot of them. Kratos can find and craft new armor for his chest, waist and arms, in addition to pommels for his weapons and an ability-granting talisman. Each piece of armor can also a number of enchantments based on their level -- my Kratos currently has six, in total. All equipment can be upgraded, and the weapons can be equipped with different special moves, which can also be upgraded. Atreus, too, can upgrade his armor, bow and quiver. It's a lot to work with, between the dozen or so equipable items and the embarrassment in resources involved in their crafting and maintenance, and it's here that I found my biggest sticking point with the game: I always felt like I was spending my resources in the wrong place, or that I should have saved for one thing or another, or that I was failing to maximize my gains with what I did have. It's not a great feeling, especially when the game is a linear narrative at its core: it slows you down.God of War.The More Things ChangeWhen the enemies are swarming, the axe is swinging and Kratos is bashing a poor Draugr's head in with his bare shoulder, it's remarkable how much this still feels like God of War. It's a heavier, more intimate version of God of War, but it feels like much more has been gained than lost: we may not have those arena-spanning acrobatics, but we have a more expansive moveset, tactical options with Atreus' bow, extensive ranged options and more. Environmental puzzles are just difficult enough to be satisfying, just easy enough to keep things moving. It is -- and this is one thing I never expected to be saying -- if anything more controller-shaking brutal than the games that came before it, something really driven home by those weighty, angry swings of the Leviathan Axe. Kratos wants to end the cycle of violence, he says, but there's plenty to be had along the way.I had heard of the Minotaur when I was a kid, at least in basic terms. I had likely seen it in a cartoon or two, as well as read about it in the kid-friendly and always popular D'aularies book of Greek mythology. It was a silly sort of thing: half-bull, half-man, angry but easily outsmarted by a red handkerchief. And then I remember playing the original God of War and just thinking: oh. Here was a Minotaur, but there was nothing silly about it. It was tall and angry, rendered with the full, ferocious terror that gave those older stories a sort of savage presence I had never really felt before. It may not have been an exactly canon version of those stories, but all those creatures and characters felt like they were made true with a kind of essential accuracy that ran deeper than that.This new God of War does that for Norse mythology, but in a different way: we still have the grandeur here and there, between the massive, stone-swinging trolls, the great coiled World Serpent and a few other pieces of set dressing I won't spoil. But it does something beyond that, too, giving us a much more involved look at the twisted family drama that make up these stories as well. The Gods here are more human then they've ever been, and there's something as captivating about that as there was about the larger-than-life absurdity of characters like Poseidon and Hades in the original series. God of War works for what it keeps and works for what it changes. It's a foundation for a series that's suddenly a tentpole once again.Developer: Sony Interactive EntertainmentPlatforms: PS4Publisher: Sony Santa MonicaRelease Date: April 20, 2018Price: $59.99Score: 9.5/10A review code was provided for the purpose of this review."

Login NowHas fatherhood truly changed Kratos or is this God of War as everyone remembers it? Our review.For adults that may be reading this, it's safe to say no one was the same person they once were when they were younger. Life changes, things happen, everyone meets people or experiences the kind of events that reshape their perspectives on life, society, and their outlook on existence. In short, people tend to grow up.God of War appears to have a reached a crossroads. People remember the series for wanton violence, vulgarity, and an unbridled rage towards the world as a whole. But this new entry to the main series from Sony Santa Monica stars a Kratos who has clearly grown up, while hanging on to the root of what made him such a badass character. It's the former that makes this one of the best stories I've seen in a Triple-A game in a long time, while the latter makes it a whole lot of fun.It'll be tough to tiptoe around the story of God of War, because honestly, there are a lot of twists and turns that should be experienced first-hand. But anyone who has followed the development of this new chapter is familiar with the central premise. Kratos is suddenly a single father, raising young boy Atreus and bringing him along on a dangerous journey across a world full of monsters, both alive and dead.The Kratos at the start of the game isn't the Ghost of Sparta that everyone remembers. He's very much settled into family life, but circumstances see him suddenly embark on this adventure through the Norse land of Midgard with Atreus. What follows is a dive into the question of fate, maturity, and the ability to choose one's own path. Is it possible for people to change who they are? Or are they destined to always go down a certain path, especially when people judge them for past actions?For Atreus, this theme also affects him as someone who's looking to stamp his own place in the world. Without spoiling the finer points of the Kratos/Atreus dynamic, God of War proves to be a fascinating look into what it means to be to try and be better, knowing they won't always be perfect, but that they have the means to sincerely endeavor to live on their own terms.The God of War combat formula returns, but with a greater degree of complexity. The biggest addition is the Leviathan Axe, which is basically Kratos' answer to Mjolnir. The Axe can be used as a melee weapon or flung at enemies in the distance. Kratos has multiple ways to fight, both with weaponry and bare-handed, with each style offering numerous upgrades and unlockable attacks.Atreus can fight, too, but he's mostly off at a safe distance. For the most part, he can't be harmed, though I did bump into a few fights where he could be left momentarily incapacitated. Those are the difficult ones, because Atreus' help can be invaluable. His arrows can be upgraded to cause significant damage or cause a valuable distraction. The little guy will even jump into the fray himself, trying to strangle enemies and giving Kratos an opening to tear in with a combo.As much fun as it is for Kratos and Atreus to fight together, there were also several moments in the game where they noticeably bonded through certain activities. There were a couple of instances in the game where Kratos would teach Atreus how to hunt with the player directing his arrow while proud papa kneeled over his shoulder or Atreus would get boosted into an unreachable area and solve a puzzle for his father. I particularly enjoyed these moments and thought more of them could have been incorporated into the story. As it was, I came to appreciate the two learning to fight together, especially when hitting the final set of boss battles.Speaking of which, I remember citing during my preview in March that I barely noticed any quick-time events. That's much less the case with the rest of the game as a whole. Quick-time events are indeed here and while they feel less intrusive than past God of War games, they did start to feel unwelcome at certain point.While past God of War games felt noticeably linear, God of War's PlayStation 4 version is very much not that. While the first couple of hours feel like Kratos is going down a set path, the world soon opens up in a huge way. It's not even just the main map, either, as players soon get a chance to check out multiple worlds, each with numerous puzzles, hidden areas, and collectibles.If I have a criticism for God of War, it's that it sometimes feels like there are too many minor collectibles. There are multiple currencies, lore pieces, tokens, and the like, all of which contribute to different things. Some are used for customization at a dwarf shop, others are used to fill out Atreus' journal, and others just feel like collecting for the sake of collecting. For example, I don't feel the need to take out 100 ravens and it's hard to imagine anyone who would.But many of the divergent side paths feel worthwhile. While some players will explore hidden temples to scoop up legendary items for Kratos, these will also contain ample challenges. Those who think the main game is too easy will dig these extra puzzles and battles.God of War was never the deepest experience, especially with what feels like limited enemy types. But the PlayStation 4 makes up for this in spades with an incredibly vast world and a heartwarming story. Beyond Kratos and Atreus, the game is filled with some surprisingly lovable characters. On top of that, finishing the main story doesn't truly feel like the end. While previous games made it feel like treading old territory to find everything, the post-game in this God of War makes it feel like the world has truly opened up.God of War feels like a breath of fresh air, thanks to a reimagined world and some deeper customization features. But at the root of the game is the classic God of War combat, slightly less gory but only slightly less grisly. Tearing monsters apart bare-handed is just as much of a rush as it ever was. And that's good, because even if it's time to grow up, it's okay not to change too much.This review is based on a PlayStation 4 download code provided by the publisher. God of War will be available on PlayStation 4 and the PlayStation Store for $59.99 on April 20. The game is rated M.Ozzie has been playing video games since picking up his first NES controller at age 5. He has been into games ever since, only briefly stepping away during his college years. But he was pulled back in after spending years in QA circles for both THQ and Activision, mostly spending time helping to push forward the Guitar Hero series at its peak. Ozzie has become a big fan of platformers, puzzle games, shooters, and RPGs, just to name a few genres, but he’s also a huge sucker for anything with a good, compelling narrative behind it.

					Absolutely enthralled and enamored with the character Kratos. Looking back on God of War 1 through 3 I always thought about them as phenomenal games that I had a huge amount of pleasure playing and adored the grandness of the combat, but I never considered them to be on a list like my top 5 games of all time. They were great...just not in the way that games like Breath of the Wild, Super Metroid, or Last of Us hit me. Seeing the change to the series never worried me at all and in fact was something I embraced! So, it's obvious to say that I can not wait to play this game and feel the rumble of the Leviathan Axe hitting my palm. I can not wait to experience the scope and adventure everyone has been speaking of and I can imagine that I'll be able to finally say that God of War is one of my favorite games of all time.

					Http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/04/god-of-war-2018-how-to-reinvent-a-beloved-series-without-ruining-what-works/2/CHUGGING ALONGGod of War's Norse myth-infused world looks great on a PS4 Pro, especially in screenshots. It looks worse in motion, though, with the frame rate constantly and noticeably chugging and sputtering below 30 frames per second during crowded scenes. This problem was frequent in the game's ""prioritized resolution"" mode. It's still sometimes present even in ""prioritize performance"" mode, where the PS4 Pro struggled to keep a consistent frame rate even at 1080p.The stuttering took me right out of the wonderful environments whenever it happened. I'd gladly trade some detail in the graphics for more solid performance. 
					The Resolution mode targets a frame rate of 30 fps, while the Performance mode unlocks the frame rate with a cap of 60 fps. (The graphics mode option is grayed out if you’re not using a PS4 Pro.) it says unlocks. Nothing about achieving 60fps target or frame times. Hitman has an unlocked framerate in performance mode and never hit the 60fps and was actually worse than 30fps.   https://www.polygon.com/2018/4/12/17227946/god-of-war-ps4-pro-60fps-4k-1080p 
					[deleted]				
					thanks guys!				
					Curious what you thought about the change in camera view (didn't see that mentioned in the review).  I was wondering if it affected the gameplay much (seeing more of Kratos, from a different angle than we usually see in the previous games). Does the camera ever pull back quite a bit to show the epic set pieces (one of my favourite things from the old games)?				
					That's one thing I'm interested in as well. When I started seeing previews/trailers/pictures of the gameplay of this new GoW my first though was, fuck that camera is way too close. 				
					The camera doesn't quite pull back all the way during combat. Think something closer to Horizon Zero Dawn. But in-between battles, the game will revel in its set pieces.				
					In anticipation of this, I finally went back and beat GoW III which I had never done.  I picked up the Remaster on the PS4 a while back and knocked it out over a couple of weekends.  Damn that was a great game and I'm kind of pissed at myself for waiting so long to beat it.  I'm way excited to the new one, especially now seeing the reviews.  The trailers gave it a Last of Us vibe with the kid around, and I know how that turned out. 
					Same! God Of War III was the last game I finished, a few weeks ago (after owning the original for the PS3, only playing a few hours of it, and then getting a cheap used PS4 copy a few weeks ago). I finished it off in a 3 days. The story was silly, but the game was glorious. 
					hmmm Im sure I saw that in the used bin at the video game store last time I was there for like $10 perhaps I should go grab it. Never played it before.				
					If you have a PS4 you should get the remaster and play that instead.				
					yeah thats what I mean... saw it in the used bin last time I was digging through 
					Have you played the previous 2?				
					How long did you punch at the end of 3?				
					Hahaha.. I let it go a good 5 minutes.. :)				
					GOD OF WAR!!!! (i am so taking an entire week off to platinum this game)				"
God of War,Kirk McKeand,VG247,https://www.vg247.com/2018/04/12/god-war-review/,"There’s a scene in God of War where Kratos decapitates someone to free them from a magical cage within the mangled roots of a tree. The original games would have relished in the act, pulling the camera close for each grisly axe swing, zooming in as the tendons snap back like stretched elastic bands. In God of War 2018, the camera pans away instead, and the act itself takes just one clean cut. The pantheon-punching God of War series has always been as subtle as a demigod’s boot to the face, but this sequel has more class, more confidence than ever. It allows things to go unseen or unsaid. In one early cutscene, Kratos’s wrist bandages untangle. He stares down at the dangling cloth as his hand instinctively tries to catch some invisible hilt, grasping at nothing. There’s no flashback to explain what he is thinking - everything you need to know is right there in his face: he has left the Ghost of Sparta, and the Blades of Chaos, behind. We join Kratos in the frozen, craggy land of Norse mythology, a place ruled over by deities Odin and Thor. He did not come here to carve up the gods, however. No. He came here to start a new life - a new life as a man. The adventure begins with the funeral of Kratos’s wife, shortly before he and his son, Atreus, take a journey to the tallest peak in all the realms to scatter her ashes. Rather than kicking off with a massive boss fight - though you punch someone through a mountain within an hour - God of War 2018 begins with a slow walk. 
 
This is a story about the sins of the father - a central theme wrapped around the experience like a flaming chain and mirrored in the characters you meet. God of War has always been thematically consistent, but rage is not the sole driving force here. Kratos is still a sullen slaphead whose brain is probably made of a bicep (he punches certain chests - treasure chests, not pectorals - open for Christ’s sake). He is also still a brutally efficient murderer who moisturises his ashen skin with the blood of his foes. Kratos is just more world-weary, mindful of the consequences of his Greek revenge spree, and now he has something to lose. ""The pantheon-punching God of War series has always been as subtle as a demigod’s boot to the face, but this sequel has more class, more confidence than ever.""Just as there’s a steadfast commitment to its themes, God of War is unmoving in its style. It is filmed in a single shot, the camera dancing in and out of the action with no visible loading between areas. There is a trade-off - it means that you can never see what is happening off-screen - but it all comes together to make the journey feel more personal. You have to admire Sony Santa Monica’s devotion to such a novel artistic choice. During cutscenes that seamlessly transition between exploration and combat, the camera dollies out or becomes a drone that hovers around the action, swooping in and following the carnage. When you are in control, the camera hugs Kratos’s back, allowing you to look around freely - unlike in the older games where fixed camera angles amped up the drama of your grandiose surroundings, often reducing Kratos to a spec against the environment. If anything, the fact you have to angle the camera up to take in some of the game’s huge creatures and ornate contraptions makes everything seem grander still.  
 
Kicking a dragon in the face is just best experienced up-close, you know? As for the violence itself, combat is comfortably familiar despite the change of perspective. You have a light and heavy attack - though now they are on R1 and R2 - and you can mix them together to create combos, or pause between attacks to switch stances and perform different strikes, once unlocked. Stagger an enemy and you can perform a grisly and satisfying execution with R3. For incoming attacks, you can dodge, guard, or - with the right timing - parry. Fill up your rage meter and you go into a fury and pound your enemies to a pulp while recovering health with successful strikes. The main difference is your toolkit. Your primary weapon (others come later) is an ice axe capable of freezing enemies or mechanisms in place. Squeeze L2 and it functions like a gun in a third-person shooter, allowing you to fling it at speed and bury it into an enemy’s face or a part of the environment - this is useful in both combat and puzzles. When the axe is out of your hands, you fight with your fists, feet, and a shield. Tap triangle at any time and the axe whizzes through the air like Thor’s hammer, hitting any enemies it passes through on its return to your hand where it lands with a lovely clunk. Yes, it is as cool as it sounds. No, it never gets old. ""Sitting alongside the snappy and at times genuinely funny dialogue are the ridiculous, bombastic set-pieces you expect from a God of War game. ""Atreus also helps out in combat, grabbing enemies by the neck and holding them in place, loosing volleys of arrows at your command, or summoning spectral animals to trample on your foes. Combat isn’t as deep as some action games, but there’s a real heft to every attack as Kratos spins like a hurricane that just swept through a knife shop, and new abilities unlock at a rapid rate.  
 
As well as pulling his weight in battles, Atreus acts as a cipher for the player’s curiosity. He has spent his entire life squirrelled away in a shack in the woods, and now he’s seeing the land of Norse mythology with fresh eyes, just as you are. As you row between islands or explore on foot, the father and son pair chat (well, Kratos grunts) about your goals. Atreus is happy to go off and explore, while Kratos is concerned only with your quest and making sure Atreus doesn’t develop his father’s temper and go all dad-stabby. Other than one clumsy bit of character development in the final third, the writing is excellent. Atreus is in awe of his father, a burly baldy who can flip an entire temple upside down with his hands, while Kratos himself treats Atreus as a student, rather than a son. Their relationship matures over the 20-odd hours the main story takes to complete, and both are different people by the time the credits roll. The same goes for the supporting cast, who are trying to reconcile their own family bonds. Sitting alongside the snappy and at times genuinely funny dialogue are the ridiculous, bombastic set-pieces you expect from a God of War game. I won’t spoil them, but there are moments here that rival God of War 3’s opening scene, only now they have something to contrast against - the moments of downtime make these wonderfully choreographed action sequences and environmental oddities really stand out.  
 
God of War comes with all the trappings of a video game released in 2018, letting you loose into a small open-world, filling it with sidequests, and layering it in light RPG elements, but it’s such a beautiful, awe-inspiring landscape that even simply exploring is enjoyable. Sony Santa Monica makes great use of the space, too, opening up new areas with dropping water levels, or allowing you to discover looping shortcuts, so there always feels like there is something new to discover when you want a distraction from your main quest.Partway through the game, you get access to a teleporting machine that allows you to access other realms, opening up the world even more. My only real criticism is how that contraption promises more than it delivers. A handful of the realms are locked throughout - presumably put aside for DLC - while two of them are essentially fighting arenas, distractions where you can battle to grab legendary loot. Only two of the other realms contain a ‘proper’ new landscape to explore. Still, it’s a credit to the quality of what is there that I didn’t want to leave its world after the credits rolled and instantly headed back into the world to punch werewolves again. God of War has grown up. It is violent, but it’s not excessive. It is angry, but there is something to contrast it against. There is a flash of nipple, but it’s Kratos’s. Kratos is older, and he feels remorse for his past, but it feels like Sony Santa Monica also wants to atone. If that was God of War’s goal, the studio deserves a standing ovation. This isn’t only the best God of War game, it’s one of the best games of the current generation. You're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!

God of War,Diego Perez,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/god-of-war-pc-review/,"It’s hard to believe that it’s been nearly four years since the release of God of War. Santa Monica Studio’s reinvention of the staple PlayStation series became an instant classic when it hit PlayStation 4 in 2018, bringing the once-dominant action franchise back into the spotlight in a big way. Now, with a highly-anticipated sequel on the way, God of War is reaching an all-new audience for the first time.Continuing the trend for Sony, God of War is the latest PlayStation game to hit PC, following in the footsteps of Horizon Zero Dawn and Days Gone. It won’t be the last either, with upcoming games like Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection and likely many more following suit in the future under Sony’s new PlayStation PC publishing label.So, how does God of War hold up on PC? Is it a messy port akin to Horizon Zero Dawn at launch, or is it a smooth experience closer to Death Stranding’s initial PC launch? Thankfully, the God of War PC port is one of Sony’s best to date, giving PC players the opportunity to experience this journey without many compromises.It’s no secret that God of War is an excellent video game. Sitting at an incredibly impressive 94 on Metacritic, it’s widely hailed as one of the defining achievements of the last console generation. We praised just about every aspect of the game in our original review of the PS4 version, awarding it a score of 4.5/5 stars. Everything that people loved about the game on PlayStation 4 is still present in the PC version, but the power and flexibility of the PC platform elevate the experience to new heights.The original PlayStation 4 version of God of War ran at 1080p and was locked at 30 FPS. The resolution was increased to a checkerboard 4K resolution on PlayStation 4 Pro, and now PlayStation 5 users can enjoy the game at a locked 60 FPS thanks to a free update. With a 4K/60 FPS patch available on PlayStation 5, can the PC version really be that much better? The answer is yes, thanks to a few PC-exclusive features present in the port.While the original game looks beautiful on its own, the PC version features enhanced graphics settings that give the game a much cleaner look. It’s not going to look anywhere near as nice as its upcoming sequel, but setting things to High or Ultra results in a noticeable improvement. The largest quality increases come in the form of sharper textures and shadows. It’s not a radical difference, but it can make the original graphics settings look a bit muddy in comparison.Performance is also great on the PC version, which is super important for a game like God of War. The game uses the original PS4 settings as a baseline, much like previous PlayStation PC ports, and the game runs very smooth on that preset without sacrificing any graphical fidelity. Of course, performance takes a hit if you bump things up to High or Ultra, but God of War features NVIDIA’s DLSS technology to help you boost your framerate. With DLSS set to Balanced, I was able to hover around 90 FPS on maximum settings at 3440×1440. Granted, I was playing on an RTX 3070, but you should be able to hit a decent framerate as long as you meet the recommended settings.As far as actually playing on PC goes, the keyboard and mouse controls work surprisingly well. Most people will want to plug in a controller (DualShock 4 and DualSense controllers are supported natively), but the game is fairly playable with a keyboard and mouse. Playing an action game like this without a gamepad might seem strange to some, but its slower speed compared to other games makes it easy to control. It helps that the default keybinds are good as well. There’s also NVIDIA Reflex Low Latency support, but the game already feels quite responsive without it enabled, so your mileage may vary with that setting.All of these PC benefits go a long way to enhance the overall experience. God of War places heavy emphasis on its narrative, so the game feels right at home on a 21:9 ultrawide display. Close-ups of characters’ faces look better than ever before if you crank the settings up, and environmental textures are very sharp. The game looks great, which is to be expected from a title that already looked so good on PlayStation 4.Since the game came out so long ago at this point, it’s easy to forget just how stellar it really is. Playing through the opening segment is an immediate reminder of how well-written God of War is, and picking up the Leviathan Axe again after all these years felt like coming home. Again, our original review of God of War goes into much more detail about how excellent the game is, but its quality really cannot be overstated.God of War isn’t the first PlayStation game to come to PC, nor should it be the last. It’s a trend that should continue, and there are still plenty of other previously exclusive games that could someday make the jump to PC. Just like Horizon Zero Dawn and Days Gone, God of War proves that PlayStation games have a home on PC. The PlayStation PC lineup seems to grow larger and larger as the months go by, so it may be only a matter of time before we see other Sony icons on the Steam store alongside Kratos, Aloy, and Nathan Drake.If you never got the chance to play God of War, whether that be from not owning a PlayStation or simply skipping the title back in 2018, you owe it to yourself to jump into the PC version. This game has one of the best stories of the last generation with thrilling action combat to match, and it’s a game that PC players should not skip. Even if you’ve already platinumed the game on PlayStation 4, the PC version is good enough to warrant another playthrough to prepare for God of War Ragnarok. Whether you’re revisiting the frozen Norse realm or diving into Kratos and Atreus’ journey for the first time, there’s never been a better way to experience this epic tale.This game was reviewed using a copy of the game provided by the game's publisher,public relations company, developer or other for the express purpose of a review.

God of War,Adam Cook,God is a Geek,https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/god-of-war-pc-review/,"January 14, 2022.How I envy anyone getting to play God of War PC for the first time. 4K resolution, uncapped frame-rates, 21:9 ultra-wide support that could make it even more cinematic than the original one-camera/one-shot direction did? Sure, you probably don’t have one of those ultra expensive wide monitors that will get that level of fidelity out of it. But with DLSS you don’t even need the best hardware available to make Sony Santa Monica’s Kratos-reboot sing.Unlike Horizon Zero Dawn, which launched in a good state but required a fair few patches afterwards, it’s hard to see much fault with the PC port of God of War. The vistas look incredible, even considering it’s a nearly four-year-old game, and some of the more colorful locations still show off some of the best art direction in modern gaming to date.For those who are going in blind on this adventure, Kratos is now living in a new realm: one that includes the Norse Gods and monsters. He has a son now, Atreus, and is journeying to the top of the mountain with him to say his farewells to his wife, who has passed away. It’s a third-person action adventure, and has more in common with the likes of Demon’s Souls than the original games, in terms of how it actually plays.Light and heavy attacks are on the shoulder buttons, you’ve a shield to block, parry, and generally stay alive. You can unlock armour upgrades, runes to use in combat, and even new skills for Atreus. He wields a bow and arrow, and will shoot on command, distracting enemies so you can devastate them with your Leviathan axe.On that note, the axe is basically like Thor’s hammer in that it can be thrown and recalled directly to your hand. 30 hours in it still doesn’t get old to throw that axe, damage an enemy, then double that damage as your recall scythes through them a second time. The combat is best in class, truth be told, and on higher difficulty levels demands precision, timing, and concentration.As someone who played the original on PlayStation 4 back when it was released, I can say that playing God of War PC has been a breath of fresh air. God of War is a title I have lauded as the pinnacle of what gaming can offer. So it was scary to go back, my trepidation leading to a playthrough of a game that feels as good today as it did four years ago. It’s a blockbuster that must have cost a fortune to make, but it’s one that, like the Marvel movies, you can see every penny on screen. It also has a tremendous amount of heart, and characters you won’t expect, nor forget.In fact, playing God of War PC has made me realise why Sony isn’t ditching the PS4 for the new iterations of its banner franchises. God of War Ragnarok and Horizon Forbidden West are both coming to PS4 as well as PS5, and playing through both recently it’s clear why. These games still look incredible.There’s a plethora of visual options that should suit almost any reasonable rig. I found it quite interesting that pushing a gaming laptop with an external GPU (Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080) in it to a 4K 60FPS quality, with everything up as high as it could go, didn’t max out the GPU usage. Unless you’re playing on an enormous screen (or outputting to a 4KTV) you won’t miss too much if you scale it down to 1080p and keep the higher frame rate, either. I didn’t notice many, if any, stutters on that 60fps as well. It was pushing my GPU to about 60-70% of its memory. But it’s still a surprise that it can maintain that high frame rate at 4K anyway. On my older 2060 card it looks just fine as well. Though obviously you’re not going to get 4K out of that without a much lower frame rate.All told, while there is no new “content” here for returning fans, this is very much one for the PC gamers out there. The PS4 version has been updated to run better on PS5, too. But frankly, all that remains to be said is that one of the best games on PlayStation is now also one of the best games on PC. As with any title, if you hate the genre, it is what it is, but a mixture of storytelling, direction, graphical and audio splendour, brutal yet brilliant combat combine to make for a game that is likely only to be topped by its own sequel. Still brilliant, and a phenomenal PC port to boot.Incredible audio & visual design
A brilliant PC version
One of the best examples of the genreMakes the wait for the sequel even harderGod of War PC is, simply put, a brilliant port of one of the best games ever to grace PlayStation consoles.

God of War,William Schwartz,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/god-of-war/,"There’s a very particular formula that the God of War series has followed since its original release in 2005.  It was one of fast-paced hack and slash action with a healthy dose of big boss battles, quick time events and brutal, bloody combat.  That story was centered around vengeance, with Kratos seeking revenge for the deaths of his wife and daughter.  If you haven’t played those games (spoiler alert), Kratos gets the revenge he sought. He rampaged through the gods of Greek mythology, killing all that stood before him on his way to the summit of Mt. Olympus.In retrospect they truly are some of the best action games of all time.  In each game Sony Santa Monica captured the imagination with the scope of these fabled gods/monsters, and killing them was the ultimate power fantasy.  While many thought that the series had been put to bed after the climax in God of War 3, God of War: Ascension, a prequel, released to far less fanfare than the previous games, and it was unclear where Sony Santa Monica could go after that.God of War is a hard pivot to something more matureWhat WAS clear was that they couldn’t just keep going back to that same well.  They had told a complete story, how much more could they tell around this central narrative?  Where do you go after you’ve killed all the gods?  Apparently you start over anew, move to a new land with a new cast of ruling dieties.  While it’s still Kratos in the central role of the game, he’s changed and some time has passed.  Older and wiser, he’s seemingly put his past behind him, or at least tried to.  He’s found peace, married again, and had a son.  Unfortunately though, tragedy is never far behind him.  While the new God of War never gives you a glimpse of the goings on between God of War 3 to the present, the game begins with Kratos in mourning of his new wife’s passing.  He and his son Atreus are preparing for a trip to bring his wife’s ashes to the highest point of the Norse lands.  The problem they encounter is that the Gods of this new realm don’t take kindly to another God encroaching on their turf and they’ll do everything they possibly can to stop the father and son from reaching their destination.  Of course there are plenty of twists and turns, interesting characters, and great moments in the game for God of War fans that are simply best experienced by playing, so we’re going to leave it at that.More broadly, God of War is a hard pivot to something more mature, something where Sony Santa Monica explores the character of Kratos on a deeper level than has been touched on in previous games.  He is different in the new God of War — He’s a father, a teacher, and a role-model. It’s a somber story, with the main goal being to fulfill your wife’s dying wish.  Everything else just seems to orbit around this. And while that might sound like somewhat of a boring description, the adventure is anything but.  God of War has incredible high peaks of action packed moments and calmer more reflective periods.  For fans of the series, there’s just enough resolution to give you satisfaction. Yet there’s just enough tease to let you know that there’s more story to tell here. What it all boils down to is a game that feels more mature and casts a wider net, telling a story that God of War fans can appreciate and others can relate to.  While previous games focused on the power fantasy and rage of Kratos, the addition of Atreus into the game alters the narrative tone, but there are gameplay implications as well.God of War has always been about combat, with Kratos slinging around the Blades of Chaos (among others) and using quick time events for what felt like big, cinematic moments in every battle.  A lot has changed here in the new God of War.  There are less quick time events. Combat has a more deliberate pace to it and there’s a lot more exploration and light puzzle solving.  In almost every aspect, the new God of War has been touched up and modernized, not straying too far away from previous games to make it unrecognizable, but strong moves in new directions nonetheless. On the combat side, Kratos has traded in his trademark blades for a more setting-suitable melee weapon called the Leviathan Axe.  He’ll use this in combination with his shield, fists, rage powers, and fancy footwork while in battle.  He’s also got Atreus in tow, who is a capable AI companion when it comes to fighting.  Atreus moves around the world, controlled by the computer, but the player does control when Atreus shoots his bow and arrow as an attack.  Putting all these things together and you’ve got a combat system in the new God of War that feels entirely different than previous games.  When you add to that a tighter, over-the-shoulder view, there’s a pretty big shift in both the way the combat looks and plays.Combat has a slower, more deliberate paceBattles are more up close and personal, with Kratos needing to pick his dodging and blocking spots accordingly, throwing in rolls, parries, and finishing moves as the opportunities present themselves — while also utilizing Atreus’ skill with the bow and arrow to soften up enemies.  The Leviathan Axe is something completely different from other weapons that Kratos has used and it really changes the flow of combat.  Kratos can wield the axe as a melee weapon, or use its projectile function.  You can whip the axe at enemies and then recall it back to you. It’s an undeniably cool mechanic.  Combat is a mixture of old school God of War and modern action RPGs it’s easy to learn but has enough depth to it that allows you to become better and ultimately more powerful throughout the course of the game or successive playthroughs on higher difficulty levels.These same weapons that Kratos and Atreus use to take down their enemies, they’re using to navigate the world, complete puzzles, and reap rewards.  The Leviathan Axe is certainly fun to toss at enemies, but it’s also used in many environmental puzzles in the game.  As it has a freezing capability when thrown, it can be used to freeze levers in place and clear paths through hazardous areas.  As Atreus grows, so do his skills with the bow and arrow.  He’ll learn a handful of abilities that allow the pair to go places that they previously couldn’t, through the use of different arrow types that can create bridges or blow-up certain types of barriers.  Being that the game is non-linear, there are many places that are technically reachable at the early parts of the game that can’t be accessed until certain skills are learned.If there’s a single complaint that we can levy against the core combat in the new God of War, it isn’t because of what’s been changed.  The new system is fun, and more challenging that the older games.  Where this game falls short is in the boss battles that you’ll encounter on your journey.  Sure, this new God of War has plenty of big moments, but they feel a little less impactful than they were in previous games.  Perhaps its the introduction to this new world, and the gods that reside here, but I think that’s because almost everyone is familiar with Zeus, Poseidon, Aries, and the laundry list of Greek gods that Kratos vanquished in his younger years.  Baldr, for example, is not nearly as well known.  Nevertheless, some of the biggest moments in the game do ultimately fall flat if only when comparing it to previous games.  What we’ve come to expect from the God of War series is fights with massive bosses, and Sony Santa Monica does a lot of recycling here, with troll bosses standing in for more iconic gods or monsters.Quick time events far less prevalent than previous God of War gamesThese troll mini-bosses feel like they’re overused just a little too much and you’ll encounter them numerous times throughout the game .  While they have unique attacks, features, and names, they all look somewhat similar to one another. Other than varying elemental attacks these battles end in roughly the same manner — with Kratos slamming a giant rock slab on them for the finishing blow.  With quick time events being far less prevalent than previous games, it would’ve been nice to see a little more variety in them when they do pop up.  The same can be said of a number of different enemy types and the finishing moves that Kratos uses to deliver a final blow.  Typically these moments were where you saw the brutality and anger of Kratos as he ripped a monster’s head off of its body or popped its eye out of socket.  The game still features this brutal violence, but it really feels boiled down into a handful of animations that you’ll likely see many times throughout the course of the game due to a lack of variety.These enemies simply aren’t one size fits all though, they have levels and weaknesses associated with them, so fighting with just a single high level enemy can be a long dance of using all of the aforementioned tools.  To tackle the baddest of baddies, you’ll need to be working to improve the skills of Kratos and Atreus by upgrading the skill trees for each of the characters. Kratos can level his weapons, rage attacks, and shield attacks.  While Atreus can level his attacking skills as a whole. These levels are somewhat gated by the loot system of the game, in which you must find items that allow you to level your weapons, and you must be a certain weapon level to learn specific skills.  There’s a lot more exploration in this God of War game than any before it.  You’re constantly tracking down treasures that include things like in-game currency, gems that can be socketed into weapons, or items that allow you to increase your health and rage meters.  Each area of the game has numerous treasures to hunt down or environmental puzzles to solve and it’s really up to you in terms of how much or how little you want to trek off of the main path.  Puzzles almost always end with Kratos popping open a treasure chest to procure some new loot.  Exploration is a big part of the game as it leads to new items and loadout possibilities, but it can be a little overwhelming at times as there is no linear path to a “most powerful character”.  While your weapon selection in itself is slim, there’s a variety of different ways to customize Kratos and Atreus in gems that are socketed into their weapons and armor.Two of the main characters in the game that you’ll meet early on are a pair of Blacksmith brothers who’ll craft you powerful armor in a number of different categories:  Chest Armor, Wrist Armor, Waist Armor, Pommels, and Talismans.  You can also upgrade your existing armor or purchase new pieces outright.  This is a pretty deep system when compared to previous games in the series and I think it adds to the game in meaningful ways that make you want to get out and explore the world to find new equipment, gems, or other items.  This deepening of the equipment systems for the series goes hand in hand with the quasi open world elements of the game.  God of War isn’t a true open world like, say, Assassin’s Creed for example.  There’s a hub called the Lake of the Nine which serves as a starting point for most adventures as it’s both a place that has numerous tributaries that can be explored, yet also holds a Tree which can be used to access different realms. You’ll hit most of these spots across the course of the story, but there’s plenty that you won’t uncover unless you explore a little bit.  The story might introduce you to some of these areas, but since the story missions are mostly linear, you’ll want to head back into these different realms to uncover hidden treasures, secrets, trials, and combat sequences.  If this doesn’t sound like the God of War that you remember, that’s because it’s really not.Freedom to explore and customize Kratos and Atreus how you wantThis is a new God of War that features many of the different trappings of more modern games, with all of the loot, progression, and exploration that are stuffed into them.  That said, all of this stuff doesn’t feel shoehorned into the new God of War either. In fact, after the credits rolled I felt like I had only seen a sliver of what the game had to offer in terms of items to unlock and secrets to find.  You do have the ability to go back into the game and explore at will and I’m glad that I did.  I found a challenge arena, a host of Valkyrie fights, and a bunch of side content that really gave you a better understanding of the world.  There are some NPC nags that you’ll encounter throughout the game that poke you in the direction of checking out side content, but I would’ve liked to experience more of this content before getting to the end of the game where it’s a little less meaningful.Where God of War does feel familiar is in its presentation.  This game is an absolute beauty on the PlayStation 4.  There’s a gorgeous art style to the game and it features some of the very best visuals we’ve yet to see on the PlayStation 4.  God of War has always been about these larger than life moments that present a sense of scale to the player that just blow you away.  At least that’s always been my takeaway from these games.  There was always a sense in the older games that you were persevering through the grunt combat to get to that massive, beautiful, book-end boss.  This game doesn’t have quite the same pace as previous games, but the big moments are still very much there.  And when they are, they are just as amazing as ever.  Sure, it’s kind of hard to top the Cronos fight, Posiedon battle, or showdown with Zeus himself, but the new God of War manages to sneak in its own big moments even if it is with lesser known figures.The new God of War lives up to expectations set by the great games before itNeedless to say, God of War has a very high bar of quality expectations to live up to.  For the most part Sony Santa Monica has succeeded.  The art direction of the game is absolutely incredible, and while there have been a bunch of great looking games on the PlayStation 4 so far, this is definitely right up there with the very best on the platform. For those looking for an even deeper, immersive experience, you can turn off the hub to take in the visuals without monster levels, health meters, threat indicators, and world compass.  Either way, God of War is a great looking, more often than not, jaw-dropping game from a presentation standpoint.It’s hard to imagine a God of War fan not enjoying this, for all the reasons that we DID mention and some that we’re holding back for the sake of spoilers. Eventhough it has seen considerable changes from previous games in the series, they almost all feel like they were for the better.  It’s a bigger, better looking game than any in the series.  The tone is a welcome change that shows us a side of Kratos that hasn’t been seen before, while introducing us to a brand new world.  There are countless hours to spend on the single player campaign and there’s a ton of stuff to keep you busy on the side. Regardless, this next chapter in the life of Kratos seems like it’s going to be just as interesting as his younger years.

God of War,Chris White,God is a Geek,http://www.godisageek.com/reviews/god-of-war-review/,"April 20, 2018.Within the first 30 minutes of God of War, I realised it was going to be special. After a breathtaking and moving scene, followed by some hunting and tutorials, then an incredible fight with an unwelcome visitor, you set off on a journey that will leave your jaw on the floor. This is the finest God of War yet, and for those that hold Horizon Zero Dawn or Bloodborne dearly at the top of their favourite PS4 exclusives, this could certainly change things. It’s going to be tricky to explain some things without giving anything away, because this is a more story-heavy God of War than ever before, so I’ll be intentionally vague: I don’t want to ruin this, and you’ll most certainly want to experience the splendour of this one on your own, especially since this one contains some of the best moments in modern gaming. Have I hyped this up enough? Good, because it’s a phenomenal game.Kratos and his son Atreus are living in seclusion, but after someone comes knocking on their door, the future for the Greek God is left hanging in the balance. He wants to live in peace, away from the dangers of the world both to protect his son, and to forget his past. Unfortunately, things go awry and the two are sent on a journey to scatter some ashes at the highest peak in all the realms. You visit many famous locations from Norse mythology, and encounter other Gods and monsters you’ll be familiar with, but the way they’re incorporated is spectacular. The visuals are impressive – from the snowy peaks of Midgard to the haunting and death-riddled realm of Helheim. The character design and animation is incredible, and the way in which you engage in combat, or watch a cutscene play out leaves you admiring every facet of it. In fact, the cutscenes are so well done they are almost unnoticeable: they segue seamlessly between gameplay and at times you’re not even sure you’re watching one, or playing one – they’re that good. In fact, this quality stretches to the direction of the game in general. The camera work is exemplary throughout, giving yet more emotional weight to moments both light and dark.The combat is vast and rewarding, and the ways in which you fight every enemy will be different from one to the next. If you’re fighting a Giant Ogre, Draugr, or Hel-walker, there’s a need to change tactics on the fly. Your main weapon is the Leviathan Axe – perfect for dealing frost damage to your enemies. R1 provides a faster strike, whilst R2 allows you to hit harder but slower. You use these differently dependent on the enemy, as well as using L1 to ready your shield for protection. Some Ogres use long range attacks which can be blocked, and there are lots of different Draugrs that will run at you, be heavily armoured, or launch projectiles at you to make sure you and your son perish. The ability to throw your axe at enemies is one of the coolest things you can do, whether it’s straight at an enemy’s head or to freeze a mechanism, it looks great – forget Mjolnir, it’s all about the Leviathan Axe. You get opportunities to build the strength of your axe by finding upgrades in chests, or going to two dwarves who’ll become your friends – Brok and Sindri, two brothers who’ve fallen out, and whose story alone provides some much needed humour throughout the heavy and dramatic narrative elsewhere.As well as upgrading your axe pommel to provide more power or runic ability, you can change your two Runic attacks. These attacks are activated by holding down L1 and pressing the relevant button to unleash the power of the Leviathan Axe, providing they’re highlighted or they’ve been through the relevant cooldown process. You can create a path of frost spikes, charge at enemies with your shield, and lots more. There’s a selection of armour on offer, with each piece improving your main body of stats, such as Strength, Luck, and Cooldown. All of these cost money (Hacksilver, here) but some not only give you added abilities, they also look badass. Even Kratos needs to look good, you know. One of the best combat features is the use of your son, Atreus. He isn’t as strong or agile as you, but his bow can provide a much needed distraction. By pressing square Atreus will fire arrows at enemies, and it can distract them, allowing you to get a satisfying thwack in. They also help stop witches teleporting, which is a massive help. Atreus will eventually get good at melee combat, and he’ll jump on enemies to steady them, allowing you to strike while the iron’s hot, or the Draugr is frozen. All of his stats can be leveled up assuming you have enough XP for the both of you, and his Talon Bow and armour will get some tasty upgrades too.The main story is impactful, emotional, funny, and exhilarating. The set pieces are ridiculously impressive, and the pace never feels slow, or too quick to follow. The relationship between Kratos and his son grows more and more as the story progresses, and by the end you care greatly for Atreus, just as much as you care for Kratos. The voice acting is also excellent, and even the supporting cast pull off some fantastic performances. I could name a few, but like I said earlier, you’re going to want to meet them for the first time when you play it. The music is so good, thanks to the wonderfully talented Bear McCreary (of Battlestar Galactica and The Walking Dead fame). There are some sombre moments when the music plays so powerfully, you may just shed a tear (and that’s just the opening 10 minutes or so). Aside from your main journey, there’s plenty to do elsewhere. While the game may be fairly linear, in some respects you’ll travel further than you’ve done in most games. Think Uncharted rather than Horizon, especially Lost Legacy. You can collect items to unlock new realms, defeat Valkyries, do favours for both Brok and Sindri, use treasure maps, find artifacts, free spirits, or just go and explore this expertly crafted world. There are elements of Metroidvania, where you go back through past locations and use abilities you didn’t have before, or explore places you hadn’t seen. There’s easily an extra 15 or so hours outside of the massive 30-hour main story. This is not your average game, it’s huge, despite being a smaller “open-world” than most games offer, it’s packed with content that’s actually enjoyable to do.This is easily up there with the best games of this generation, and it’s the easiest ten out of ten I’ve ever given. When you think you’re reaching a point where the gameplay slows down, you’re introduced to something better. This is by no means a game just for original fans of the series either. Due to the new setting, newcomers will enjoy it just as much. It’s welcoming and punishing, but ultimately satisfying, and the benchmark has been set firmly for the future of video games. A masterpiece.Excellent combat
Character and environmental design is incredible
Stunning soundtrack
Enemy variety

God of War,Mike Minotti,GamesBeat,https://venturebeat.com/2018/04/12/god-of-war-review/,"Connect with top gaming leaders in Los Angeles at GamesBeat Summit 2023 this May 22-23. Register here.In 2005, God of War was one the coolest things I ever played. The PlayStation 2 action game was fast-paced, brutal, and edgy. But after several sequels and prequels, both its formula and attitude felt stale. I began rolling my eyes whenever Kratos yelled or ripped the head off some mythological beast.The PlayStation 4’s God of War is changing a lot when it launches April 20. Kratos is now fighting in a Norse setting instead of ancient Greece. But that new locale isn’t the most radical departure. This God of War is slower, less gory, and less angry. Kratos is no longer a one-dimensional machine of rage and vengeance. He’s a father trying to understand and train a young son.This new Kratos makes God of War relevant again.Above: “Look, Atreus. Everything the light touches is our kingdom.”A more mature godGamesBeat Summit 2023Join the GamesBeat community in Los Angeles this May 22-23. You’ll hear from the brightest minds within the gaming industry to share their updates on the latest developments.The old Kratos was fun in that generic action hero sort of way. He had little character development. The tragic past was for his motivation, not for our contemplation. Kratos was like The Hulk. Kratos smash … well, really, Kratos kill. Horrifically.The end of God of War 3 left little for the Spartan to do. He had killed all the gods and had his vengeance. So how does he end up in these lands of the Norse? How did he find love and a family after everything he went through. These questions build immediate interest in the revival.And Kratos himself, who used to be an avatar of destruction, is now interesting. He’s still angry, but not in a generic, shout-happy kind of way. His anger is something he tries to control (if often unsuccessfully). It comes out as impatience, rebuttals, and refusals, most of them directed at his young son, Atreus.Kratos’s child is with him through most of their journey. They often talk to each other as they work on their troubled relationship. It’s a dynamic that’s not unlike the one between Joel and Ellie in The Last of Us. The connection between these two stars gives us an investment in their world and story beyond the beasts, monsters, and people they’re killing.Above: Kratos still fights plenty of monsters.Intense combatGod of War has more in common with The Last of Us than a child/father relationship. Previous God of War games use high-angled cameras that gave you a view of Kratos and most of his surroundings. For this reboot/sequel, director Cory Barlog has dropped the point of view behind your back, similar to a third-person shooter.But this is not a shooter. You’re still using weapons and magic to attack enemies, and the closer camera angle has an intensifying effect on combat. No, it’s not Dark Souls. But the action is slower and less dependent on combos than before. Much of the combat revolves around keeping track of the multiple enemies you engage, a more difficult task when you can’t easily see behind you.The perspective adds drama to fights. You see the details in your enemies and the weight in Kratos’s blows.And while combat doesn’t rely as much on combos, it can still be flashy. Instead of his chain-daggers, Kratos has a magical axe. You can swing it like a normal weapon, but you can also throw it … and then summon it right back to your hand. It works akin to Thor’s magical hammer from the Marvel comics and movies, and it’s just as awesome as it sounds. With its freezing powers, the axe also serves as the key to a number of puzzles.Atreus has a role in combat as well. While you control Kratos, you can still order your son to shoot arrows and use other skills. These can go a long way toward keeping enemies distracted and dazed. It has you feel like you’re controlling a team instead of a single fighter.Above: Pretty.A beautiful, connected worldGod of War is an open-world game, but not in the way you might think. Its world is large and connected, but don’t expect Far Cry or Horizon: Zero Dawn. You’ll find few empty spaces or trivial sidequests. Every part of the world feels big and distinct.It’s a beautiful and detailed setting — one of the most gorgeous I’ve ever seen.Instead of today’s open-world games, God of War reminds me of Metroid Prime. It’s big, with many paths, but places have a way of connecting back to hubs or other shortcuts. And just like with Metroid Prime, the world encourages you to explore far-flung areas and search for secrets. You’ll even acquire abilities later in the game that help you access new places and unlock treasures.It’s … differentThe original God of War games are good. Some of them are great. They have a lot of fans, and not all of them will be happy to see just how much Sony has changed Kratos and his world. Even as much as I love this new game, I did have times where I yearned for something faster. In the older God of War games, you could kill dozens of enemies with a few combos. It could make you feel like a god. The combat here is slower.The new mechanics work and are satisfying, but they do, in a way, feel unlike God of War. If you’re nostalgic for something like the original, this may not satisfy you.Above: “Uh, you got something on your face.”This new God of War takes a lot of risks. It trades blind rage and revenge for a story about a troubled father/son relationship. It ditches fast, combo-based violence for something more methodical. It’s a departure from everything that once was God of War.But almost all of these risks pay off. God of War is an exhilarating, beautiful action game that turns one of PlayStation’s biggest icons into a character you can care about.Score: 90/100God of War comes out for the PlayStation 4 on April 20.

But if you're looking for a mature game with some gratuitous, yet stylish violence thrown in for good measure, then please keep reading.This isn't the Kratos you remember from the previous God of War titles. This Kratos is somber, grieving and a bit scared. After seemingly destroying the world as we knew it in God of War III and beating his father, Zeus, to a bloody, mushy pulp, the titular demigod has run afoul of the Norse pantheon. And instead of cutting a swath of destruction through the land so deep that you'd hear the gnashing of teeth and lamentations in your dreams, Kratos has settled down and gotten a family.But this is Kratos we're talking about, and nothing comes ever comes easy for him. At the start of the story, we find him and his adolescent son, Atreus, searching for a specific type of wood for a cremation — for Kratos' wife. Once the father-son pair has immolated the body, Kratos gathers the ashes to fulfill his lover's last wish and spread them at the top of the nearby mountain. However, before father and son can begin the trip, Kratos has to hide his son when a mysterious stranger accosts the father. Odin knows that Kratos is here, the stranger says, and does not appreciate the Greek's presence.So, Kratos and Atreus embark on a quest to honor their lost loved one, and the path is fraught with danger, magic and mystery. But the biggest obstacle is the distance between father and son. How does a god in exile, who succeeds through sheer rage, stubbornness and a twinge of myopia, find the tenderness needed to nurture his growing son in the boy's time of need? After all, this is the same Kratos who killed his daughter at the start of the series and later forsook her when he reunited with her in the Elysian fields in a later title.Throughout the game, I wanted to throw my controller at the screen when Kratos would go to comfort his son, only to think better of it and draw his hand back. For the love of Zeus and Odin, Kratos, give that child a hug! But this is a sentimentality I've gained as I've gotten older. I'm curious how a younger gamer, battle-hardened by hundreds of hours of gameplay, will feel about this new relationship.In this new GoW, you won't necessarily be tearing out a cyclops's eye while the camera lovingly pans and zooms over the gore. That's not to say that the game isn't violent — heavens no. During my time exploring the Nine Realms, I've impaled a dark elf with his own spear and torn the still-glowing, beating heart from a golem. I've also grabbed a wraith-like witch by the face and torn her head off — so yeah, plenty of violence.But developer Santa Monica Studio has definitely matured in the way it tackles violence. The colors are richer, and the textures more detailed, especially when you're playing on the PlayStation 4 Pro on a 65-inch Samsung television. I started playing by myself, but quickly had an audience of my coworkersoohing and ahhing at the action. By then, I had unlocked enough moves on the skill tree for both Atreus and Kratos that combat looked like a beautiful ballet. While Kratos dove into battle, using his physicality to bludgeon, slam, kick and grab, Atreus used his bow to stun enemies and provide a bit of crowd control, keeping the hostile numbers manageable.Depending on the skills you have unlocked, you can aim Kratos' Leviathan ax like a sniper rifle to get precision headshots at range, or you can send it spinning into a crowd of hostiles like a whirling dervish of death. Best of all, when the carnage is done, or when you want to just bury the weapon in the head of a foolish foe, you can call the ax back to Kratos' waiting hand with a quick tap of the triangle button.Currently, my build of Atreus has him shooting off three arrows at a time to disperse enemies. He can also summon a magical frost wolf to dispatch foes. But just because he's small, don't think that Atreus can't go toe to toe with some baddies. Depending on the armor, you can unlock a number of melee traits. For instance, Atreus will jump on an enemy's shoulders and choke them out with his bowstring or throw Kratos a health boost if Dad's low on energy. Atreus can even revive his father when Kratos has been knocked out.Ultimately, Atreus is the evolution of the smart AI-assistant dynamic we praised in BioShock Infinite with Booker and Elizabeth. Similar to Elizabeth, Atreus' relationship with his father drives the story. However, in combat, Atreus takes things a step further than what you saw in BioShock, thanks to his dynamic combat skills. There was never a time when I worried that he wouldn't be there to provide ample support. And even when I'm not directing where his arrows should go, he's a competent-enough companion that can hold his own.The God of War series has typically been a linear experience, with a bit of backtracking thrown in for a touch of exploration. This latest edition of GoW is still linear; however, the world is anything but. The set pieces are massive, with nooks and crannies just aching to be explored. Right now, my favorite place to return to is the Sea of Nine, which is littered with islands that you can explore.The strangely placid waters are always foggy, which makes navigating on a small canoe a bit tense, especially when you have only a small lantern to light the way. But, suddenly, the fog lifts, and you find yourself in front of a hulking statue of Thor or by an abandoned village with a chained dragon. In another part of the game, I traveled to a different realm that had gorgeous bridges made of light, big, purple flowers and graceful, but-murderous dark elves, all under a rose-pink sky.In another part of the game, you'll encounter a huge face carved into a mountain, with billows of midnight-black smoke pouring from the nose and mouth. My point is: Explore as much as possible.Not only are you going to encounter some incredible sights and sounds, but you'll also find that many of those trips lead to hidden treasure chests. These can yield new armor, power boosts or items that you can sell to a vendor. Santa Monica Studio made a gorgeous game that you shouldn't rush through. Don't be afraid to stop and enjoy the scenery, as well as the dialogue between Kratos and Atreus.Similar to what you find on other GoW titles, you're not a god-killing badass at the start of the game. The skills that allow for those fancy air-juggles and devastating shoulder slams will have to be earned throughout the course of the game. But instead of using the blood-red souls of your enemies, you'll purchase abilities via experience points. Kratos has four sets of skill trees to Atreus' two. With Kratos, you can enhance ranged, close, rage and shield attacks, while Atreus has trees for magic and expert combat.Outside of a quick video for each skill in its respective tree, the game doesn't hold your hand when it comes to putting together effective combos. It's up to you to learn what moves work best against which enemies. But before you panic, know that Atreus' journal doles out some helpful tips via the bestiary. Once you get the hang of it, GoW becomes an exercise in strategic strikes and dodges, instead of frantic button-mashing.  MORE: PS4 Games: Our Staff FavoritesPrevious GoW titles took a couple of popular components from role-playing games and used them to great effect. This is the first GoW in the series that incorporates stats in various armaments like tunics and bracers. Most armor pieces will directly affect Kratos' attributes, including strength, vitality, luck, cooldown and defense. However, some armor will feature a slot or two for an enchantment or a talisman, which can unlock passive abilities like getting a small health boost with every ax kill. Best of all, armor, talismans and enchantments can all be upgraded to get more-powerful attacks.God of War has come a long way. The series began as a bloody good romp through the Greek pantheon with a devil-may-care attitude, and it slowly fleshed out the torment of a man turned god. The latest iteration of the franchise takes that legacy and expands upon it brilliantly, delivering a mature story that allows Kratos to grow up. Now, the titular God of War can fully reflect on his past deeds and try to impart some of his hard-earned wisdom to his son, all while attempting to establish a meaningful relationship with said child. Add in an evolved take on the GoW combat system, smartly integrated stats and skills, and an absolutely gorgeous world, and you have a game that I plan to complete a couple of times over. You should too. Credit: Tom's GuideSherri L. Smith has been cranking out product reviews for Laptopmag.com since 2011.

God of War,Alice Bell,"Rock, Paper, Shotgun",https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/god-of-war-pc-review,"Dad's backIn the eight year gap between 2010's more conventional sexy gore fest God Of War 3 and this new and improved action-dadventure God Of War, the angry Ancient Greek warboy Kratos handed in his god-killing badge and gun to live in Norse mythology's woods with his wife Faye and their son Atreus. When Faye dies, Kratos & Son go on a journey to scatter her ashes from the top of a mountain. This becomes a micro rumination on familial relationships, a macro world-saving epic of legendary proportions, and a hack and slash fest that'll have you grinning from ear to ear. On balance, then, I am Team Fridge Faye.I played this God Of War on its previously exclusive release on PlayStation in 2018, and it lived in my memory as a 70 hour poetic battle between gods and monsters. Revisiting it again on PC, it turns out that it's actually only about 20 hours long, but it looms so large as an experience that turning it off at the end feels like stumbling into daylight, having spent many weeks in a firelit, sweaty hunting lodge in a Norwegian pine forest, slamming mead and singing songs about warriors tearing goats in two. There are a lot of big warriors in God Of War. There are a lot of very big things in it in general: statues, dragons, big angry rocks. And a big man, because the titular Kratos, as a yardstick to measure size, is already incongruously big, just so many sacks of salted beef held together by leather armour.The whole time you are beset by giant wolves, fiery beasts, and, yes, boss fights with gods. Atreus, though he be small (especially in comparison to, for example, giant world-circling snakes; his dad) does not turn God Of War into a 20-hour escort mission. Indeed, he operates as a sort of attack drone during combat. You can order him to fire arrows at the press of a button, but otherwise he'll hover around, attacking whichever enemy you're not focused on, or choking them out with his bow when he's feeling bold. This frees you up, as Kratos, to lay waste to the place with a magic axe.The Leviathan Axe is your weapon of choice for the majority of the game (there are other options later), and it's best wielded with a controller (though the M+K defaults are serviceable if you're a purist). The Leviathan has ice powers, and you can throw it and call it back to you like a boomerang. Combining heavy and light swings with a pretty dynamic blocking and dodging system, as well as special runic magic attacks, makes combat fast and fun despite Kratos's weighty style. Though he has an invincible rage mode you can use once he's built up enough anger, I mostly tried to build up an enemy's stun bar for an insta-kill attack where you might, for example, stamp on their head like a ripe cantaloupe. When you chain all your abilities, well, it's a proper delight. I stunned a draugr tank enemy with an ice run AOE attack, picked him up and charged him into an elf, then impaled the elf with his own trident. Lovely stuff.You always have to pay attention, though. If you take your eye off the ball then you can easily go down to one of the draugr or other undead that make up the majority of your enemies. These come in different elemental flavous (earth, fire, ice, plague) and are often backed up by bigger lads like Soul Eaters or trolls - mini-bosses the first time you encounter them, but thrown in as extra challenges as you get better and stronger.Levelling is a more manual affair compared to other action-adventure RPGs. For example, earning XP to unlock new moves and abilities in combat is just one of the building blocks you're given to create the strongest possible Kratos. You also have to think about your armour, your weapons, the levels of both, and the buffs applied from socketing runes on your gear. You can also unlock combat abilities for young Atreus, so you're kind of building the father/son team you want as they go on their journey.This aforementioned journey is, no word of a lie, epic. Your starting realm is Midgard, aka realm of the normies. It's the largest area, and one you'll return to and spend the most time in. It's a cold place, the iron-grey waters of the lake around Tyr's temple changing as the great loops of a giant snake move. The water level drops, and new, strange shores emerge. You tramp through mud and snow, and sometimes over bright green moss. You can easily pad the 20 or so hours of the story to well over 30 if you explore all the optional nooks and crannies of Midgard, and some of these are the best bits of the game. Exploring the halls of long-dead mountain Kings, or haunted mines full of giant crystals. You use the axe in small platforming puzzles here as well, freezing gears on doors in place or smashing wooden boards to clear a path for Atreus, so he can then throw down a chain for you to climb.Other realms are slightly smaller in scope in terms of exploration, but their sense of vision is anything but. Alfheim, the realm of the elves, is one of blossom and Lord Of The Ringsian architecture set against a balmy sunset. Muspelheim is an optional time-trial challenge in a kind of volcanic colosseum. Niflheim is a poisonous maze. In the course of this game, you fight through the frozen depths of hell, travel deep inside the earth, and climb the mountain-sized corpse of a giant. And what's so impressive is that, through all of this, God Of War manages to centre the relationship between Kratos and Atreus in everything.Kratos's backstory makes him almost the original sad murder dad of games, and while his previous adventures were sort of peak Degeneration X in their tone, in this God Of War it foregrounds him being a father. His relationship with Atreus, his struggle to know what being a good dad might mean, and to express love in a way his son understands, is the heart of the game. The unreal setting for it disappears behind the amazing performances of Christopher Judge and Sunny Suljic, just being a man and a boy who don't understand each other, but want to. Atreus will comment on events, expressing admiration for a particularly good shot, or defeating an enemy. As the game goes on, he will ask for advice or disagree with Kratos more openly, seek approval, or gently make fun of his ol' dad. And in turn, Kratos gives approval, begins to respect Atreus's unique skills, and smiles. They meet each other somewhere in the middle, balancing pragmatism and empathy.You see their relationship everywhere in the game. In the architecture of ruined temples, in the side quests you're given, in every single supporting character who seems to be paired up with a family member somehow, a mirror of Kratos & Son. It affects how you fight, how you explore, how you interact with other characters. God Of War feels like a game crafted from the ground up by a team of many people all pulling towards the same thing: to make you feel emotions about these two boys. But also, to really enjoy it.You're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!

Create Account The latest God of War game is all about growing up.We see it first in a strained relationship between a young son, Atreus, and his father, the franchise’s perpetually angry antihero Kratos. The former is mourning the loss of his mother while attempting to forge a stronger bond with his distant dad, who is at once overprotective and seemingly uncaring as he tries to teach his son how to be a man in a dangerous world, while the latter is struggling to move beyond the uncontrolled rage of his past and become a responsible paterfamilias.Sign up to receive the daily top stories from the Financial Post, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.A welcome email is on its way. If you don't see it, please check your junk folder.The next issue of Financial Post Top Stories will soon be in your inbox. We encountered an issue signing you up. Please try again Just as importantly, we see a new maturity in the series’ transition from traditional hack and slash play to something a little more modern and nuanced. The camera is pulled in tight, just over the shoulder of our musclebound protagonist, creating an intimacy lacking in previous God of War games that’s well suited to this edition’s more sophisticated storytelling.Some long-time franchise fans might be disappointed to see SIE Santa Monica Studio’s series, best known for its epic battles and visceral violence, evolve in such ways. But I suspect there are plenty of players who have also grown up a little over the 13 years since we were first introduced to Kratos who will appreciate the transition. Besides which, after half a dozen games each of which has attempted to outdo its predecessors via bigger set pieces and a growing sense of wrath and fury, it just feels like a good time for a change.If you’re new to the series, here’s all you really need to know heading into this latest entry, dubbed simply God of War. Once upon a time a Spartan warrior named Kratos was tricked into murdering his own family by the Greek god Ares in order to achieve the power necessary to win a desperate battle. When he realized what he’d done he was overcome with a consuming hatred of all things deific, and he spent the next several games killing off pretty much the entire Greek pantheon to sate his need for vengeance. Eventually – and a little ironically – he discovered that he himself was the son of Zeus, and, thus, a demigod. God of War III – chronologically the most recent game in the series prior to this one – saw Kratos destroy Zeus and ended with our protagonist sacrificing himself for humanity, perhaps his first truly selfless act.Fast forward to now, and we learn that Kratos has somehow survived. He’s ditched Greece for more northern climes, residing in Midgard during the time of the old Norse gods. His trademark chain swords – once embedded in his wrists by Ares – are gone, the wounds covered with bandages, and he’s grown a thick hipster beard.What’s more, he has a new wife and son. However, the game picks up just after the death of the former, with Kratos and Atreus about to embark on a journey to sprinkle her ashes atop the highest peak in all the realms. Cue adventure, starting with a shockingly primeval physical confrontation with a small, strange man – played in wonderfully eccentric fashion by the always odd Jeremy Davies – sent to visit Kratos by the Allfather Odin that involves tree trunks wielded like baseball bats and the cracking of mountains.So there’s no need to worry; the franchise’s signature violence hasn’t been diluted. Intense combat remains core to the formula, highlighted by Leviathan, Kratos’ new dwarf-forged, Mjölnir-like magical axe, which is highly gratifying to both swing and throw. It even comes back on command at the tap of a button, lethally bludgeoning any enemies unlucky enough to be caught in its path. And we can feel the ferocity of battle in subtle but effective new ways, from expertly executed controller rumbles to cinematic camera movements – like the harsh, kinetic snap when Kratos catches his hatchet – perfectly suited for the new over-the-shoulder camera configuration.The series’ strong puzzle DNA remains intact as well.Scores upon scores of clever conundrums and secrets are scattered around Midgard, from runic language barriers that require translation to challenging environment traversal brainteasers, many of which are tied to the continually evolving shape of the main hub world, set on a lake that drains as the game progresses to reveal secret passages, shipwrecks, and ruins. It’s an extraordinarily intricate feat of virtual mapmaking – made all the more special by the game’s absolutely stunning visual presentation (this is a new graphical showcase for Sony, especially if you happen to play on a PlayStation 4 Pro connected to a 4K HDR TV) – that only grows more gratifying the more you see.And added to all of this is a new emotional connection with Kratos we’ve never before had. We finally get to see him attempt to redeem himself as a father and family man. And, given his shameful and bloody history – which he hides from Atreus – his relationship with his son is stressed in all the right ways. Their arguments, Atreus’ resentment and worries, Kratos’ overwhelming need to ensure his son doesn’t make the same mistakes he did – it all rings authentic and true on a surprisingly deep level. Kratos is no longer seeking revenge, but rather redemption. He feels multidimensional for the first time. As a dad, I sometimes found myself rooting for and even identifying with him on a gut level, especially as I watched him make some obvious parenting mistakes.SIE Santa Monica Studio has leveraged this change in narrative tone to create a kind of strategic combat more befitting a modern flagship console franchise.In addition to a bevy of axe attacks – the selection of which at any given moment depends on equipment upgrades and the magical runes players choose to equip – players also have control over Atreus’ archery. Kratos’ son runs around the battlefield of his own accord, attacking when he sees openings, but we can command him to shoot specific enemies to stun and damage them as well as summon ghostly beasts to support the pair in combat.The duo’s interactions create entirely new tactical possibilities not seen in previous God of War games. More than that, their battlefield interplay informs their relationship as father and son. It’s a wonderful thing to watch as it takes shape.Of course, with so many changes to the God of War formula it was perhaps inevitable that there would be a stumble or two along way, the biggest of which is a frustrating amount of backtracking. As I took on new side quests, found more treasure maps, and gradually gained additional abilities that let me access previously inaccessible areas, I found myself revisiting the same locations as many as half a dozen times over.The sense of repetition is thankfully mitigated a bit by the progressively changing shape of the main world map, but the need to keep heading back to the same places time and again eventually affects the game’s pacing.This issue is exacerbated by a fast travel system so limited – especially for the first 15 or 20 hours – that I almost never used it, opting instead to run or paddle my way to my destinations.Realizing that players would be spending plenty of time traveling between locations, the writers gave the main characters the ability to burst into random conversations during lulls – including the telling of classic (and revised) Norse myths, related to us by the disembodied head of Mimir. But, entertainingly orated as these stories may be, they are a bandage solution to a problem that really ought to have been solved through game design.Still, we all know growing up is hard work. Everyone makes a few mistakes. The key is keeping them relatively small, and – as Kratos repeatedly tells Atreus – learning from them. I get the sense that SIE Santa Monica Studio, with some bold changes worth applause, has set out on the right path toward maturing this iconic franchise.

God of War,Ron Burke,GamingTrend,http://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/apple-doesnt-fall-far-god-of-war-review/,"I never imagined a world where I’d be describing God of War as an emotional and well-wrought storyline wrapped around challenging yet well-balanced gameplay, but here we are. Technically the seventh game in the series (console and portable, minus the mobile game), this newest God of War represents a massive shift for the series, introducing RPG elements, a wealth of gameplay mechanics, and a semi open-world setting. I was excited to see Kratos try to rebuild his life after the apocalyptic end of God of War: Ascension, but I was unprepared with just how amazing this new journey could be.I will do my best to not spoil elements of the storyline in God of War, because unlike its predecessors, this game features a non-linear and highly rewarding storyline. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoyed the more their straightforward action and bombastic storytelling, but this outing is…different.God of War opens with an older Kratos and his young son, Atreus, on a journey to the top of the highest mountain in the land to complete a sacred task. You see, Kratos, having moved to the Norse lands, has settled down and raised a family. The father/son story that unfolds is rewarding, touching, emotional, genuinely funny, and insightful. The writers at Sony Santa Monica have outdone themselves, and the smallest moments between Kratos and Atreus are profoundly impactful.As Kratos and his son enter the Norse world of the Gods (specifically, the Lake of Nine) they encounter the more traditional setting over the Marvel-ized version. Specifically, the nine realms of Asgard, Vanaheim, Alfheim, Svartalvheim, Muspelheim, Niflheim, Jötunheim, and Midgard — the last being the realm of men. Sidenote: The Nine Realms exist in the Marvel universe, though I would also consider God of War to be a bit of a reimagining of the original myths as well, though in many aspects it stays more true. Ultimately, the Norse myths are largely represented here, though they benefit from being framed by a different perspective than you might find in Bullfinch’s Mythology. What’s different here is that Kratos isn’t on a progressive killing streak to remove all of the Gods from each realm one world at a time, instead encouraging his son to ignore the petty squabbles of these Norse Gods, eschewing contact with them at all costs.The world(s) of this new God of War are absolutely massive in scale.Too much ale and a man’s heart is laid open for all to see.
It was at the moment I realized that all nine of these worlds exist in the game (though you won’t visit all of them) that I realized that this newest God of War would be the longest of all of them — easily approaching 35 hours or more, to tackle all it has to offer. God of War has always been about fighting your way to a boss, getting something from that boss (their head to turn people to stone, or to light your path, a new weapon, etc.), and using it to solve a puzzle or open a pathway. Here, the world is (mostly) open for you to explore. For the first time, side quests are a subsection in the menu, granting entirely optional challenges that can result in additional lore, loot, and XP. There are still collectables that upgrade your health and rage, but now smaller collectables like carved wooden cups and child’s toys can also yield additional funds for upgrades. What starts as a very personal story for father and son very quickly begins to have major ramifications in the world around them, building to a finale that is both shocking and epic, and zero doubts as to whether the story will continue.For reasons best explained by the game’s storyline, the Blades of Chaos that once were strapped to the forearms of Kratos are gone, replaced by Leviathan’s Axe — a magical weapon that returns to the hands of Kratos not unlike Thor’s magical hammer, Mjölnir. Unlike Mjölnir, Leviathan’s Axe is imbued with a frost power that can damage, freeze, and even shatter enemies. Or at least, that’s how things start.
God of War has a completely revamped upgrade mechanic that touches all facets of the game. No longer is the progression gated by having a specific upgrade, or having found the right amount of Gorgon Eyes (in this case health upgrades come from Iðunn’s Apples, which have a cool mythology all their own), but instead are gated by a combination of skills and equipment. Throughout the world you’ll find hacksilver (again, cool real-world history), gold, and magical bits and bobs. Visiting Brok and Sindri, the two dwarves that created the aforementioned Mjölnir hammer, according to Norse mythology, gives Kratos a chance to craft his own chest, waist, and wrist armor, bonus-granting pendants, and even new gear for Atreus. You can also upgrade this equipment a few times, adding sockets for gems, and upgrading their stats across six stats — Strength, Runic, Defense, Vitality, Lucky, and Cooldown. It’s very reminiscent of the Diablo III system, though loot drops are far less common.The expansive gear system gives players a wealth of options to fit their play style.If you are thinking that God of War is now a full-blown RPG, that’s not entirely true. Sure, the various stats affect our hero’s ability to fend off damage, deal it, or unleash his various powers, but you won’t be juggling inventory or having to grind out levels. Instead, equipment is somewhat rare, must be crafted or purchased, and is wrapped around six primary stats. It’s a nod to min/maxing stat management, but at the end of the day, having the right gear for the job is secondary to having honed the action skills for combat.Instead of whipping around the Blades of Chaos, Kratos now engages at multiple ranges with his fists or the Leviathan Axe. Kratos can throw his axe at targets (each of which with more than half a dozen target areas), swing it at close range with a light or heavy attack, or smash foes with his fists and a new shield that springs from his bracer. As before, the mechanics are intuitive enough to pick up, but challenging enough to master. When you begin to face challenging (and often very large) foes, your earlier practice will pay dividends.One thing that surprised me, based on previous games, is that Kratos no longer swims or jumps. Sure, he’ll jump as part of a combat action, but there is no longer a dedicated button for either action. Instead, timing blocks with the new shield takes up the shoulder button press, leaving Kratos a more defensive option than he’s had in the past. Dodging is a big part as well. This is an older Kratos, a little more cautious, especially since he’s not just fighting for himself this time. Timing and nuance rules the day here, instead of raw unbridled devotion to aggression.The skills system grants upgrades for your weapons, shield, and Atreus’ bow.To help Kratos in combat, Atreus has a bow that he can unleash, as well as new moves to learn and equipment to craft and upgrade. In the beginning, the game feels like you are in the longest escort mission ever as you shepherd over Atreus (though he can’t die permanently). As his skills and equipment grow in power, his ability to stun enemies becomes invaluable. There were more than a few opportunities after the midpoint in the game where I am certain I would have failed repeatedly without his help. Just as it unfolds in the story arc, my appreciation for Atreus matches that of Kratos.Magnificent massacre in motion
Running at 4K native resolution on PlayStation 4 Pro (thanks to some fantastically applied checkerboard rendering), God of War’s presentation is a visual feast. I didn’t imagine that we’d see something exceed the jaw dropping work Guerilla Games gave us with Horizon Zero Dawn, but somehow that’s precisely what we have here. From top to bottom, the visuals in God of War are without compare — this is the new game you reach for to show your friends why you bought a PlayStation 4 Pro.  I’ve included a slice of combat that is entirely spoiler-free below, running at 4K resolution on a PlayStation 4 Pro — enjoy.The level of detail and quality in Kratos and his son Atreus are staggering. His leather armor looks careworn, with obvious buckle indentations, gorgeous fur padding where it contacts the skin, and indentation where the straps bite into the material. His shield gauntlet has rivet-placed reinforced plates underneath the shield to create stabilization, his axe hand wrapped in highly detailed cloth. Similarly, his pouches are cross-stitched, the leather looking supple from years of use. Kratos’s skin is equally as detailed. His skin is porous, with well-defined muscle structures, the signature (though somewhat faded) red chest marking buttressed by the scars of a lifetime of battle.Sony Santa Monica is well known for delivering staggering visual quality, and nowhere is that more clear than the faces in this game. Kratos and Atreus get the most attention, naturally, but the extensive supporting cast of friends and foes are equally as lovingly crafted. Kratos, now on a different path in his life, has grown out a strikingly realistic beard, sporting a few more lines in his face than in his youth. In a world where this level of quality exists, there’s no need for jarring CGI cutscenes.Through story elements I won’t reveal here, Kratos finds himself in Midgard. The region is deeply rooted in Norse mythology, which is reflected in every space in the game. From large structure to small, every rock, flower, waterfall, lava flow, and shimmering lake shines with detail. I see no evidence of copy and pasted textures anywhere here — the entire game looks like it’s been lovingly crafted by hand, and the bespoke result is absolutely staggering.It is impossible to convey just how gorgeous this game really is.Moving a level deeper, the lighting and particle effects in God of War are a tour de force. The bombastic action is accented as his axe bites deep, spraying colored pyrotechnics this way and that. Smashing a foe in the face with the edge of your shield is equally as satisfying as the game pulls a tried-and-true slow motion moment, the shield casting sparks as it impacts. Combined with the physics engine, the game comes to life. Wood explodes and falls naturally, and cloth flexes and bends as Kratos twists to catch his returning axe in flight. It brings everything to life, driving immersion to amazing effect.On Playstation 4 Pro, we get to see the full HDR color pallet in all of its glory. Gone are the often-muted color schemes of prior games, replaced by a rich and varied color space for worldbuilding. The volumetric lighting highlights this nicely, creating dense fog, falling debris, gorgeous godrays, and beautiful shadows that rarely look jagged as they interplay with objects in the environment.On a stock PlayStation 4, the game runs at 1080p. The framerate is rock solid, with only the most minor of hiccups when a new area is loaded. While it isn’t as jaw-dropping as it is on the Pro, it looks better than just about anything that has come out for the 4.5 year-old system.The environments in this game are absolutely stunning.I would be remiss if I failed to mention the audio in this new God of War. The music is scored by Bear McCreary, along with lead music producer Peter Scaturro, culminating in a growling Nordic score (with Faroese singer Eivør Pálsdóttir tackling some amazingly difficult singing), with rousing percussion and an amazing orchestral backing. Equally as impressive are the various effects. Kratos smashing his way through the world has never sounded so good.Alongside this amazing soundtrack and fantastic sound effect work comes some of the best voiceovers I’ve heard in recent memory. Christopher Judge (of Stargate SG-1 fame) replaces TC Carson as Kratos, but his deep booming voice embodies an older Kratos perfectly. Atreus is played by Sunny Suljic, whom you’ll be able to see on the big screen in his role in the upcoming film, The House with a Clock in Its Walls. Both turn in fantastic performances, supported by equally incredible work from a supporting cast that I can’t name as they lie squarely in spoiler territory.It’s very rare that a game grabs me this completely, but God of War is, without a doubt, an early contender for Game of the Year. It’s flawless in its execution, and the new benchmark for action titles. Well done, Santa Monica Studios, and thanks for taking us on this entirely new adventure.—Ron BurkeSee below for our list of partners and affiliates:One of the longest running independent gaming news, reviews and culture sites on the web.The thing that is magical about the Wizarding World isn’t the magic – it’s...by Ron BurkeThe world is going to end.

God of War,Jez Corden,Windows Central,https://www.windowscentral.com/god-of-war-pc-review,"No offers foundWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.Sony has been gradually opening up its coffers to Windows PC gaming over the past few years, first with Horizon Zero Dawn and Days Gone. Now, we have another PlayStation 4 classic hitting gaming rigs everywhere on Jan. 14, 2022 — God of War.A reimagining of the classic PS2 franchise, God of War masterfully reforges the classic hack 'n' slash action into a surprisingly thoughtful action-adventure, set in a fantastical Viking-era Nordic setting. Mythological behemoths roam the land, while a band of Æsir gods hunt the eponymous Kratos for reasons unknown.You already know God of War is hailed as a masterpiece, with top-shelf acting and writing, next-level art direction, and varied and satisfying combat. A question emerges of any console to PC port: Is it faithful to the platform? That answer is a resounding yes.Bottom line: With a surprisingly heartfelt story, witty and memorable characters, restlessly satisfying combat, in an expansive and well-optimized hand-crafted world — simply put, God of War is a must-play game.Disclaimer: This review was made possible by a review code provided by Sony Interactive Entertainment. The company did not see the contents of the review before publishing.Sony continues its streak of faithful PC ports with God of War. While Horizon Zero Dawn and Days Gone had issues for some users at launch, Sony and its partners worked hard to bring them up to speed. It seems they may have taken some of that learning to God of War, since even on this build I've had for a month, I've had nothing short of an utterly flawless experience.I am running God of War on a Razer Blade 17, with an RTX 2070 Max-Q, 16 GB of RAM, and Intel i7-10875H CPU, with Windows 11. It's by no means the best gaming laptop out there, but it's handled most of what I've thrown at it at 1080p or 1440p. While performance naturally varies from system to system, I've been utterly impressed with God of War's performance on my system, although it took me a bit of tweaking to balance the game's stunning visuals and effects with a frame rate that didn't produce tearing or performance degradation. In the end, I settled on 1440p with a 50 FPS limiter to create a consistent experience on my 4K monitor. At 1080p I could easily reach for a higher frame rate, but God of War is such a detailed and cinematically crisp game, I wanted to really see how far I could push the visuals without settling for a middlingly low frame rate. Of course, you can also leverage both SuperFX from AMD and NVIDIA DLSS too, which is nice to see. Naturally, more powerful systems than mine will produce better results, but the game performs exactly as I would've expected given my hardware, given its overall presentation density.Source: Windows CentralGod of War gives you a mountain of display settings to tweak and accessibility options to configure, showcasing Sony's efforts to make full use of the benefits of Windows and PC gaming. Of course, I can't test God of War on every possible PC configuration out there, but the fact it works as well as I can expect on my hardware, despite not having a ""day one"" update, I'd say it bodes well for general performance (hopefully).God of War is an audiovisual work of art, and the quality of its PC port bodes well for future Sony games.Beyond performance, God of War is a simple marvel on the art direction department too. The music is majestic and varied, cutting deep in the game's most emotional moments, and ascending with cinematic intensity during setpiece boss events. Every axe hit, bone split, and skull smash can be felt with delicious excess.Midgard is surprisingly varied in its environmental design too. It goes beyond the typical real-world landscapes of the Nordics you'd expect, although even these look incredible, with snow tessellation, stunning lighting and weather, and crisp details. Where God of War shines is in its more alien climbs, the elf realm of Alfheim shines with otherworldly fleshy coral structures, and ancient ruins beset by civil war. The way the opposing elvish factions are depicted is unlike anything I've seen in modern takes too, with Dark Elves appearing almost insectoid in their presentation. God of War takes well-traversed tropes and subverts them, much like its predecessors did, usurping the ancient mythos of Greece to tell a wholly new tale. It exemplifies Kratos himself, rebelling against what's expected of him, often violently.God of War is an audiovisual work of art, and the quality of its PC port bodes well for future Sony games making their way from PlayStation to Windows. God of War is a rare game that very effortlessly marries its art direction with its story and gameplay delivery too, which also defy expectations.God of War has plenty of nods to the history of the franchise, but as its title suggests, it's something of a reboot. In the original games, Kratos is something of an anti-hero, victimized by a Greek pantheon of Gods depicted as corrupted by vanity and greed. Kratos ultimately spells their demise, usurping the role of God of War for himself. Following the events of God of War III, it appears from the outset that Kratos fled ancient Greece and headed north, to the frozen mountains and evergreen forests of the Norse lands.Settling down with a wife and fathering a sickly human son, Kratos resigns himself to simple wilderness living. The game begins with Kratos and his son, Atreus, tending to the last rites of Faye, who has sadly passed on. Faye's last wish for her husband and son was for her ashes to be scattered at the realm's highest peak, setting Kratos and Atreus on a lengthy journey fraught with perils and mysterious godly conspiracy, that unravels into several impressive twists and turns throughout the plot. Right at the very beginning of the game, Kratos does battle with a scrawny-looking man who sports godlike strength, in a battle that splits the very ground in twain.Without giving too much away, God of War weaves a truly masterful story that follows themes laid down by the original games. It showcases a Kratos utterly haunted by his past, and his struggle to forge a new future for himself and his son. Kratos' angry demeanor is gradually softened throughout the game by Atreus, whose childlike curiosity and kind-hearted nature stands wholly in juxtaposition to the anti-heroic Kratos, whose capacity for brutality shines through in every combat segment.The story delivery alone makes God of War a must-play title.God of War examines fatherhood, grief, and ultimately healing in the least likely of settings, creating a strangely human and sobering tale in a world full of gigantic serpents and fantastical magic.I can say quite honestly, I was not prepared for just how engrossing God of War turned out to be. Although it started a little slow in the beginning, I would come to find myself utterly transfixed to Kratos' tale, and the unraveling mystery of their quest. Why are unknown godlike beings rising up against Kratos? Why are the wilds crawling with undead revenants? What happened between God of War III and now? All of these questions and more are answered as you play, told through the eyes of Kratos and Atreus, whose relationship grounds the player in reality amidst all the fantasy. It's masterfully done, and the story delivery alone makes God of War a must-play title. Thankfully, there are even more reasons to love this landmark title.God of War reimagines the hack 'n' slash gameplay the series is known for into a heavier format for the reboot. Kratos of 2018 is less agile, but has a big arsenal of Norse-inspired runic magic, a Thor-like retractable axe, and other tools that keep combat as varied as it is cinematic.The Leviathan Axe is a marvel of modern video game engineering. There's no other weapon really like it in any game I've played, and its use weaves beautifully with Kratos' character animation and the game's physics, like a paintbrush of destruction. Kratos can throw his axe in various ways that get more complex as you grow in power, using the axe to freeze enemies (or indeed, puzzle elements) in place, or clip flying enemies out of the air. Of course, you can also use it to butcher enemies into bloody chunks, juggling them in the air dynamically, before splitting them in half. Once you learn the Leviathan Axe's ins and outs, you'll feel immeasurably powerful, dancing around enemy attacks while stripping their flesh from their bones, and as soon as it starts getting old, the game throws new enemies, epic boss events, and new weaponry your way to keep things persistently fresh.If you've thrown the Leviathan Axe into an enemy, you can instantly call it back boomerang-style, carving enemies along its trajectory path along the way. You can also leave it still on the battlefield, and use your fists and Sparta-inspired shield to beat enemies into bloody chunks, ripping them apart with a badass contextual execution at the end.Atreus accompanies Kratos along the way, and grows in power and confidence in the game's combat dialogue as the story progresses. He also gets more attacks and can accompany Kratos from afar with magical bow shots and acrobatics that make the pair feel increasingly like a single combat unit. It's almost lamentable that a second player can't control Atreus, but perhaps in a future installment.Indeed, there's not a huge amount to complain about when it comes to God of War's combat, besides things that would be ""nice to have,"" like co-op play. I also wasn't a huge fan of the Gears of War-like shoulder camera, since it can be hard to manage enemies who are attacking from behind or from the side, but it's a minor gripe ultimately — and the game does give you indicators if an enemy off-screen is about to attack.God of War also has a layered progression system that ties deeply into the game's exploration elements. Make no mistake, God of War is a beast of a game, easily taking completionists upwards of 30+ hours to fully explore.All of that is bespoke hand-crafted content, too, with no pointless and repetitive open-world busywork masquerading as gameplay either. The land of Midgard is meticulous in execution, with incredibly detailed dungeons, filled with puzzle elements and exploration opportunities.Hidden crafting materials help you to build up Kratos' strength and arsenal, allowing you to construct increasingly powerful armor and gear, helping you undertake further optional bosses and other challenges. As the story progresses, more worlds and areas open up for exploration too, and additional tools give you the ability to backtrack to previous areas to unlock more content as well. In an age of flat and basic open-world games, experiencing God of War's weaving, handcrafted dungeons, and setpieces was a true delight.God of War almost makes me lament how rare these types of experiences seem to be getting at this level of quality. It's a testament to the quality that Sony has become known for. The fact that they're porting their games to PC so faithfully deserves every bit of admiration and praise, and I can only hope this trend continues.Source: Windows CentralGod of War is another wholly expected win from Sony and its teams on PC. Like Days Gone and Horizon Zero Dawn before it, God of War seeks to capitalize on a vibrant PC market eager for high-quality, polished experiences — and God of War for PC utterly delivers.Polished to a glistening finish, God of War is an example to be followed for any company seeking to bring their console-bound titles to the vital PC gaming space. Well optimized with heaps of configuration options, God of War bodes well for future titles making their way across from PlayStation.As a game, there's little more to say that hasn't been said already. God of War is a masterpiece, simply put. From when it launched originally in 2018, to its PS5 upgrade, to this PC version, regardless of how you play, God of War is a landmark experience that publishers outside of Sony itself simply seem incapable of achieving. Incredible art meets ambitious storytelling and meticulously precise combat, creating a whole that is greater than its already formidable parts. God of War is utterly incredible.Bottom line: God of War for PC is a truly incredible experience that subverts expectations with a surprisingly deep story, flanked by incredible audiovisual direction and relentlessly satisfying combat. God of War is a landmark experience that absolutely everybody should play.Jez Corden a Managing Editor at Windows Central, focusing primarily on all things Xbox and gaming.

God of War,Tom Hoggins,Telegraph,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/reviews/god-war-ps4-review-one-gorgeous-spectacular-impactful-blockbusters/,"Salvation does not come easy, particularly for a god. And even less so for Kratos, the Spartan deity that crushed, crunched and dismembered his way through the entirety of Olympus in a murderous, vengeful rage. Across three main games and three prequels, from the brutalisation of Hercules and Helios, to the demise of his father Zeus, Kratos let nothing stand in his way until the entire Greek pantheon were giblets and bone.So where on Earth (or the heavens) do you go from there? Often when a video game series has run its thematic course, it calls for a complete revamp; the safety of a reboot preserving a popular name while rewriting its history.Despite the non-numerical title suggesting a complete do-over, God of War is thrillingly different. This is more redemption than reinvention, though there is plenty of that too, as Sony Santa Monica levy the weight of Kratos’ past in one of the most gorgeous, spectacular and impactful blockbusters of the generation.In truth, Kratos is hoping for peace more than penance. As we as we join him in the wilderness of the Norse mountains, the Ghost of Sparta is mourning the death of his wife, Fay, and must now take sole care of their young son Atreus. A sickly boy with a hot temper, Atreus is aware of his father’s own coiled rage but not his true nature. Now the pair must fulfill Fay’s final wish; to have her ashes scattered at the highest point of the nine kingdoms.It’s a paternal road trip, then, with the simplicity of the setup allowing the details to flex and breathe much in the same way as cinematic cousin Logan or Sony stable-mate The Last of Us. In God of War, it is in Kratos teaching Atreus to survive in a hostile land while controlling his own rage in the hope his son will not make the same mistakes. “Don’t be sorry,” growls Kratos as Atreus fluffs an arrow shot, “be better.” Which, as he wrestles with his own brutal instincts, feels like an edict to himself as much as the boy.From a player’s point of view, it means Atreus is a constant presence by your side, aiding in scraps with a volley of arrows and helping Kratos navigate an unfamiliar world. In one sense, God of War will be familiar to series veterans: you will fight mythological ghouls in combo-heavy combat, solve environmental puzzles and occasionally have to crush the skull of beasts three times your size. But, again, the details are deliciously different, honed to freshen up the formula and welcome more modern newcomers.The camera hugs close behind Kratos as he wields his frost-imbued Leviathan Axe, fights exploding with screen-shuddering force. While Kratos may try to rein in some of his rage for the sake of his son, when it comes to battle he is barely contained fury. Fights flare violently and quickly, with your axe thumping into draugrs and trolls with thunderous tactility.Even early on, combat is dynamic and gratifying. Juggling foes with sweeps of the axe up close, or throwing it from afar before recalling it like the world’s most lethal boomerang. You might launch your axe through an enemy’s leg, them collapsing to the ground, parry an incoming blow with your shield before thumping your assailant with coiled fists before recalling your axe back through the bad guy and swatting them away like a fly. It’s terrific stuff, with Atreus damaging and distracting from the perimeter with his own elemental arrows, always an asset rather than a burden.As you progress through the game and your arsenal expands, with you sinking experience points into simple but generous skill trees, you unlock more elaborate combos and rib-splitting power attacks. The action is extraordinary noise and fury, rather than balletic martial prowess, but is always fluid and intuitively controlled.Wielding the axe feels fantastic and doesn’t God of War know it, often using it in simple but satisfying environmental puzzles as Kratos lobs it into gears, snips dangling ropes and freezes doors open. The spells of quiet between the combat flashpoints are often just as compelling, with exploration becoming a key part of the game as it progresses. Initially you might venture off the beaten track to simply hunt out goodies on your way through Midgard, but within a few hours the game opens up exponentially as you reach the hub of the Lake of Nine.From here you can take a row-boat across Midgard, before eventually travelling between realms entirely. Areas are gated off in a familiar Metroidvania style, by glowering red crystals or angry looking hell brambles, waiting to be discovered as you uncover more gear or elemental powers for Atreus’ bow. The elegant simplicity of the narrative plays its part here. While it is liberal with its thrills and peril, particularly as Odin and the deities of Asgard start to pay attention to Kratos’ escapades, the nature of your quest gives plenty of room to explore.And you will want to make room. Not least because God of War is a stupendously good-looking game, possibly the very best on console. Kratos himself, aged and bearded, is staggeringly detailed, from the scars he has collected to the individual scales on his pauldrons. The landscapes, meanwhile, are quite extraordinary. Snow-capped mountains overlook sprawling vistas, a glorious technicolour forest is resplendent with vibrant reds, greens and a enormous kindly turtle carrying a friend’s house on his back. The Lake of Nine is a sun-drenched paradise at first glance, overlooked by a giant mountain-spanning snake that peers down on crystal waters and wrecked statues of Thor.Technically it is glorious, with dancing light and colour, from fire, magic or blood shimmering over almost every scene. But its head-spinning cinematography is quite something too. God of War is shot as a single continuous-take, much like Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu’s Birdman. The camera attaches itself to Kratos’ back as you play, of course, but then swings and swirls around him during cutscenes in a dizzyingly brilliant effect before nestling in behind you when it is time to move on.God of War is a phenomenal video game and takes cues from both its own past and more recent games to build its vocabulary in its more open exploration and RPG-elements, but it is also extremely well-versed in the language of cinema. This is nearly always to the game’s credit as it finds it rhythm both visually and in its surprisingly excellent script.Despite some heavy-handed mood swings from Atreus later on, the relationship between Kratos and his son is superbly-pitched. Both of them initially struggle to come to terms with their relationship, Kratos struggling with his inner-demons, Atreus with his father’s hitherto absence and fury. It isn’t immune to cliche, but does well to avoid becoming too saccharine. Kratos’ is a coiled spring and harsh taskmaster that is quick to admonish, with a temper that isn’t always easy to like. But that only manages to make the tender moments more effective. God of War is open about Kratos’ descent into thuggery in previous games, but you buy into his desire for Atreus to avoid repeating his folly without absolving him.It is not an easy balancing act, particularly for a video game in which you are using an axe to snap the jaw of an ogre, but the central relationship carries the game admirably. It is supplemented by a terrific supporting cast too: a mysterious witch of the woods, the bickering blacksmith brothers in a constant battle to outdo each other by upgrading and crafting your equipment; Mimir, a sometime companion with a Scottish lilt and a fine line in Norse mythological tales. It is sharp, effecting and, perhaps most surprisingly, genuinely funny. Try to hide a smirk at Mimir describing Thor as a ‘sweaty bawbag’ or the delightful terseness of Kratos trying to regale Atreus with the fable of the tortoise and the hare.All of this equates to a game that crackles with the thrill of its ferocious combat and vast expanse of Norse mythology, but also takes pains to stay grounded and intimate. How well this will play with fans of the series remains to be seen. This is, without question, the biggest God of War game yet -it will be knocking on 30 hours before the credits roll- but is comparatively reserved in scale. And as the game succumbs to a touch of bloat in its denouement and a habit of enemy repetition starts to bite, you wonder if a few more gargantuan scuffles would have filled the gap before its spectacular finale.But perhaps that would be too easy, because as it is God of War represents a stunning, creatively-risky gamble that deserves to pay off. Turns out there are plenty of places it could go, after all."
God of War,Keza MacDonald,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/apr/12/god-of-war-review-violent-vengeful-and-more-brilliant-than-ever,"PlayStation 4; Sony/Santa Monica StudioKratos returns older and wiser, but still exhilaratingly brutal in a story that deftly intertwines family drama and mythological epicAs the average age of video-game developers and players has crept upwards, everyone has started to expect more from their characters. In the last decade, formerly two-dimensional avatars from Lara Croft to Wolfenstein’s BJ Blazkowicz have been retrofitted with backstories and motivations – with varying success.On the face of it, Kratos, the vengeful god who powered the excellent (and gratuitously violent) God of War games of the 00s, is an absurd candidate for such humanisation. Until now, his sole character trait has been angry. He has retired to Scandinavia, is recently widowed and father to a tweenaged son who knows nothing of his god-slaying, blood-soaked past in Greece. He and the boy set out to scatter his wife’s ashes from the top of a distant mountain, getting unwillingly caught up in the affairs of Norse gods along the way.This God of War wants us to see Kratos as a person, rather than an instrument of extraordinary violence. The game not only pulls this off, but turns Kratos and his son’s journey into one of the best games of recent years: a deft intertwining of relatable familial drama and awe-inspiring mythological epic.The combat is not as comically overblown as it once was, but this is still a very violent game, with deliberate, intense fights against creatures ranging from the frozen undead to building-sized monsters. It is exhilaratingly brutal: every hit has heft, and most enemies are a threat. You can unfurl an arsenal of attacks with bare fists, a shield and an ice-imbued axe that, once thrown, flies back into Kratos’s hand with a satisfying thunk. His son, Atreus, who blinks back tears while hunting a deer in one of the game’s first scenes, gradually becomes more accomplished with a bow and helpful in confrontations.When not fighting, you are exploring the reaches of Midgard on foot or by boat, finding temples and ruins that take inspiration from Norse mythology. Treasure chests and mythological texts are hidden in places that need brainwork rather than brawn to unlock, encouraging the player to look around and feel present in the world. The axe is frequently put to alternative use in these puzzles, freezing mechanisms in place or thrown to flip switches or destroy sigils. Comprehending God of War’s memorable places is as satisfying as sinking the axe into a demon’s skull – alternating between thinking and fighting gives God of War a rhythm that can be absorbing for hours at a time.The game is one continuous shot, with no interruptions; irritating necessities such as loading screens are hidden so effectively that you barely realise they are there. This cinematic commitment to Kratos’ point of view enhances the story’s efforts to humanise him. You walk in his boots, flowing between combat, story scenes and exploration without interruption. There are abundant moments of outstanding beauty: canoeing beneath the rusting legs of an ancient statue of Thor and on to a lake; traversing the bodies of fallen giants; entering a temple to find cavernous, treasure-packed chambers, resplendent works of virtual architecture. It is among the most visually impressive games made – so much so that rendering it makes the PlayStation 4 sound as if it’s about to expire.God of War’s world is enormous – set aside at least 30 hours to explore it – but it is devoid of the busy work that plagues similarly ambitious games. Every diversion from the main story is an adventure rather than a task, making exploration worth your while for more than the treasure; some of the best stories here are hidden. The mythological setting imbues this world with mystery. Players feel like archeologists, learning more about the fiction with every foray into an unexplored corner of the map.God of War is a story about what it means to be a god – traversing realms, killing mythical monsters, exerting power, exploring the boundaries of possibility – but also about what it means to be a man. Power and masculinity are intertwined, and Kratos’s desire to protect his son from the realities of both is unexpectedly touching. Atreus is far from the irritating sidekick he might have been, complementing Kratos’s gruff and humourless dialogue with quips and endearing observations, turning his father’s intense seriousness and inability to find humour in anything into a running joke. Their dynamic changes shape more than once over the course of the story, and their relationship involves a lot more demon blood and magical artefacts than the typical parent-child relationship, but Kratos is still a distant, emotionally remote father trying clumsily to reach out to a son who feels unwanted.It is rare to play a game so accomplished in everything it sets out to do. God of War is a standard-setter both technologically and narratively. It is a game that, until recently, would have been impossible."
God of War,David Carcasole,PlayStation Universe,https://www.psu.com/reviews/god-of-war-review-pc/," David Carcasole / January 19, 2022God Of War Review (PC) – Developer Sony Santa Monica’s 2018 hit God Of War is not the first PlayStation Studios game to appear on PC.In fact it’s the third, but there’s something different in the air about this port. God Of War coming to PC represents a step forward both for PlayStation and its community of players, and thankfully this port put its best foot forward.First off, since this game has been out since 2018 I feel it pertinent to tell you I’ve played it three times through, before jumping in on PC. After another 19.5 hours according to Steam, I’ve now played it four times through.I absolutely adored it at launch, and getting back to it on my PC transported me back to those early memories. What is especially amazing however, is that the same awe I had when I first played God Of War on my new PS5, after it had been patched was captured again on my PC.Whether 4K or just 2560x1440p, which is how I played it on my deck, this game will take your breath away. It was practically shocking that it looked that good, while running so well. It is clearly very well optimized, as I had absolutely no problem holding a steady framerate without compromising the visuals while playing on my low to mid tier build. You can check out my detailed PC specs at the bottom of the review below.Each moment, narratively and visually was still impactful the way it was when I first played through them. It’s a wonder and a joy to play it on PC as a long-time PlayStation fan, knowing that so many more players can now experience this amazing game.This whole review won’t be in absolute praise of everything, God Of War does however. There are choices that, – of all things – add monotony to an otherwise varied and fun fighting system.Namely, the enemy variation. I’ve played the game one each difficulty level, with my most recent one being on Hard. It’s not a boast, only a distinction that when you play on those higher difficulty levels, the lack of variation within the different creatures you fight becomes so much more apparent.Some enemies are distinct, but you’ll be given more of the common variety drauger and undead far more often than fighting unique creatures like Nightmares. Even those however have their limit, when you start to just see elemental skin differences of every enemy type.These changes from a “Frost Nightmare” to a “Poisonous Nightmare” to a “Fire Nightmare” did little to add any variety as to how you dealt with them, and the same goes for other enemy elemental variations. Your arsenal stays extremely consistent for the whole game, and it is fun as heck to throw and swing the Leviathan Axe around.That doesn’t change the fact that encounters do end up feeling repetitive. The most egregious encounters though, are unfortunately the boss encounters. All of the main campaign bosses, barring The Stranger and a dragon are very literally the same kind of troll or ogre with a different elemental variance.There’s little to no difference in their attack patterns, and by the end of the game the process of killing them really does feel monotonous. It’s unfortunate because at its best, the combat is intense, challenging, and spectacular all at the same time.It just feels wasted to keep fighting the same kinds of enemies over and over.Those familiar with God Of War are likely shouting, “What about the Valkyrie fights?”. I’ve completed each of them, and they are all exquisite. Yes, it is the same kind of enemy multiple times, but they each have a variety to how they fight that helps make it feel fresh. It also helps that they are the most challenging fights you’ll find in the game, which makes them all the more intriguing.However, those fights alone do not make up for the rest of the game, especially when they are all optional, and can be entirely skipped over.What has been applauded more than anything else though about God Of War, and deservingly so, is the story. Kratos and Atreus’ journey to spread their Faye’s ashes at the highest peak in all the realms is transformative in every sense.It’s a narrative that I can at least connect with deeply. I don’t think I’ve ever met someone who hasn’t had a problem connecting with their parents, specifically their father at some point.Of course I’m not alone in that, and watching how they both grow to know one another in a way they didn’t at the start. Playing it again, I found myself actually astonished at how it seemed like Kratos in retrospect, doesn’t really open up that much.He spares Atreus of the details in most cases, and fails to answer questions at all points of the story. It is clear that it’s difficult for Kratos to open up. I’ve played every game in the God Of War franchise, and well aware of Kratos’ crime and trauma.Having already had a family that he was manipulated into killing, followed by endless violence and trauma that only ceased when he was near dead and causing unknown chaos – it isn’t surprising to see him be a closed off kind of guy.However it was in this playthrough, with God Of War Ragnarok on the horizon, that I thought more about the narrative within the context of its sequel. Maybe this first game isn’t about the big emotional leaps Kratos doesn’t take, but rather the small advances that build a foundation for Ragnarok to take off from.It didn’t change just how much I knew I would enjoy the story. I just found it to be an interesting guise under which to play, which ultimately helped me understand the game in a new way.Without giving away spoilers, more than anything it is clear that this is Atreus’s story. It makes me all the more excited for what’s to come, when Ragnarok hopefully releases sometime this year.Simply put, if you haven’t played God Of War yet then playing it on PC is an absolutely incredible way to do so. It is undoubtedly in my mind the best way to experience the game, especially if you have the rig to crank it up. Or even if you have something more like mine, which was borne out of budgetary needs.Even if you have already played it on PS5 or PS4, if you have a capable PC I encourage you to pick it up. This game is well worth revisiting and the more we can get amazing first party PlayStation titles like this on PC, the better.Now Sony – we have Uncharted coming to PC next, I think we all know what should come after that. Grant us eyes, grant us eyes…!God Of War is now available on PC on Steam and the Epic Games Store.Played on a PC featuring:Review code generously provided by the publishGod Of War on PC is unsurprisingly the same amazing game it was on PS4 back in 2018, although its pain points are more blatant years later. The visuals, narrative and stunning experience however do not disappoint and remain as impactful as they've always been. It also helps that this is so far, Sony's best port to PC in terms of optimization. This is well worth picking up, whether or not it is your first time.

God of War,Lillian King,COGconnected,https://cogconnected.com/review/god-of-war-pc-review/,"When God of War came out, it was one of the biggest releases of the year. Nearly every news outlet put it in contention for best game of 2018. It won many of these nominations, including the Game Awards title. It was a huge console-selling exclusive for the PlayStation 4, and it revitalized the franchise without losing what made it compelling.Everything I said just now is what I’ve been hearing people say for the last three years, but I’d never played the game myself. Thankfully, Sony Santa Monica changed that by finally releasing God of War on PC.If you’re like me and you managed to avoid one of the best games of the last decade so far, the story is simple. Kratos is a Greek god of war traveling with his son Atreus through the harsh, cold world of ancient Scandinavia. The player fights using combo attacks with Kratos’s new Leviathan axe and unlocks the open-but-not-quite-open-world with various puzzles. The rebuilt combat is incredibly fun, but the real star is the growing and nuanced relationship between Kratos and Atreus.One of the most striking differences between God of War and other triple A releases of the same time is the seamlessness of the scripted scenes. Instead of awkward loading time before a cutscene, the flow of the gameplay and visuals are almost indiscernible. It’s incredibly impressive that I couldn’t always anticipate the moment when the game returns to the player’s control.God of War accomplishes what all huge game environments should do: it makes the player want to explore. Every time I loaded up the game I planned to get straight into the main quest, but I always got distracted by the nooks and crannies hidden in every corner, lush or barren.The game’s not completely perfect. The map disoriented me sometimes. I love armor and weapon systems, but God of War had so many different enchantment and rune options that I felt bogged down by them. It’s a sad day when I dread looking at my loadout.On a less technical level, it’s an intense game. I’m not talking violence, but general tone. I really had to be in the mood to immerse myself in the world of Kratos and Atreus. It wasn’t something I picked up for twenty minutes on a whim. When I played God of War, I was sitting down for a Serious Gaming Session.I don’t want to expound on the game’s original features too long. COGconnected reviewed the game at launch, and you can check our PS4 review out here. The game’s core elements remain the same as they did then. What makes it different is that I played it hunched in front of my computer screen.I played God of War on a slightly out-of-date gaming laptop. I thought I’d have to lower the framerate or resolution, but I didn’t. This meant I got to enjoy the game at its peak graphics quality, and it ran butter smooth with few exceptions. The game crashed twice while I was playing it, but I lost virtually no progress both times. I also had very few bugs. Looking back, I’m struggling to remember any bugs at all, although I’m sure they’re there in some respect.Playing God of War on PC took several forms for me. First, I tried to power through using the classic WASD keys, but that only lasted until the first boss fight. The controls felt too clunky and unnatural to me.After that, I switched to a wired PS4 controller. After my partner expressed an interest in watching me play, I took my laptop off my gaming desk and out to our living room, where she could see the screen more easily. This was the most enjoyable experience yet, and how I finished out the game.Therein lies the problem. Playing with a controller in my living room? Wow, that sounds like something else I know. The solution I really wanted was, simply, my PlayStation. Long, cinematic games like this just aren’t the types of games I want to play on my computer.How you play God of War comes down to personal choice. If you’re the type who still mods Skyrim and prefers to play on a computer come hell or high water, the PC experience of the game is for you. If you’re prepared to sacrifice some graphical quality for playing comfort, then you’re better suited to the console experience.Of course, it’s a little more complicated if the PS5 is an option for you. Making the decision for graphics isn’t the obvious choice it used to be. The differences between God of War PS5 and PC are slight enough that if you prefer to play on console, I’d recommend going that route.If you don’t own any PlayStation consoles and this is your first chance to play God of War, then this is your call to action. It’s worth it: there’s a reason everyone was obsessed with this game. God of War lives up to the hype, and it hasn’t aged since its release. All the reasons God of War was so good the first time around haven’t gone anywhere.I’m glad Sony Santa Monica released God of War on PC. The more people who can play God of War, the better. Maybe you’ll end up just like me: one of those people telling everyone how good God of War is. Finally.***A PC code was provided by the publisher***Developer: Sony Santa MonicaPublisher: Sony"
God of War,Andrew Farrell,PC Invasion,https://www.pcinvasion.com/god-of-war-pc-review/,"It was a big deal when Sony began porting some of its exclusive PlayStation games to PC. As the company puts out some of the highest-budget, best-made games around, the possibilities were very promising. Though when it came time to release the first couple of games outside the PlayStation brand, we got a couple of somewhat bland open-world games instead of anything that really showed the true potential of the surprising development. But God of War is here now. It’s not only the best game in its series, but it was one of the best of the last decade, making it a true must play for anyone that hasn’t gotten to experience it yet — even nearly four years after its initial release.If you’ve never played a God of War game before, this is kind of a soft reboot, so that doesn’t matter. All you need to know is that there’s this demigod named Kratos who became a god by killing the everloving shit out of other gods. No familiarity is required even if bits of the other games are alluded to, and knowing the backstory is worth plenty for the character. Much like the earlier games focused on the Greek pantheon, this new setting is all about Norse mythology. And, boy, does it work. The writing in the game is amazing. The cinematography of the cutscenes is still as jaw-dropping and intimate as it was nearly four years ago. Time has done nothing to diminish how insanely high quality every facet of God of War‘s production. It’s visually astounding on PC, and you can find yourself hitting high framerates outside of certain larger areas. The story is terrific, with a strong emotional core buoyed by a likable supporting cast that grows as things progress. Pretty much everything about the game is a beacon of excellence.The gist of the story is that Kratos’ second wife has passed on (not by his own hand this time, either: AAAAAAAAAREEEEEES!!!!). She requests that, after her untimely demise, her ashes be scattered from the highest mountain in all the realms. Kratos and his son, Atreus, don’t have the warmest relationship on account of Kratos being, well, Kratos, but the two set off to grant her final wish. But things are, obviously, more complex than what it seems. The Norse gods know what Kratos is and most don’t take kindly to other deities on their turf. Our father and son duo find themselves embroiled in matters outside of their control. And that’s without mentioning that they might be slightly misinterpreting just what their quest entails.What follows is an epic, lengthy adventure that is simply one of the best games you can experience. There’s a reason God of War was dubbed ‘game of the year’ from not only multiple awards shows, but a bevy of publications as well. It does have its detractors, but the game is very much considered a modern classic for the most part. At the time this seemed kind of nuts, as the original games, while good, were smaller and less ambitious.God of War follows a linear narrative, but there’s a ton of side stuff to do off the beaten path. Optional chests, upgrade materials, side quests, spirit birds to wallop by throwing your ax, and collectibles abound. There’s a lot to the game, to the point that it can easily keep you hooked for 30 hours or more. That wouldn’t mean much if it wasn’t for the insanely high-quality world design and wonderful controls, though. Kratos starts the game by using either his wife’s frost ax or with his bare hands and shield, but things get a bit more, let’s say, familiar around the midpoint.Kratos’ moveset can be supplemented with new skills once the proper amount of experience is collected. But you’ll also be able to craft new types of armor, each of which has unique statistical properties. God of War is almost an action-RPG, but it’s too focused to really go that far, I’d say. There are also a bunch of special attacks that can be set, as well as summons. Atreus is a constant presence in combat, as Kratos can direct him to shoot at foes with his bow, plus he’ll distract enemies and hold them back for you. There are even important abilities bestowed upon you which grant some Metroid-esque opportunities to go back and get things you couldn’t before. It’s all awesome.I never particularly cared for the combat in the earlier titles. It was good, but I always felt like Kratos’ weapons were made of Nerf foam. Here, combat is much more immediate and satisfying. The originals also had a considerable focus on quick time events and button mashing to put enemies down, while this game usually just has you press a single button once you do enough stun damage. Kratos can use light and heavy attacks, block with his shield, and do quick steps as well as dodge rolls to avoid damage.The combat is extremely responsive and visceral. Throwing the ax at a foe, only to watch them freeze in place once it embeds in their face, and then beating them to death with your bare heads is really something. The only thing I don’t like here is that there’s still no FOV option, so the camera is wicked close. Aside from combat, there’s a hell of a lot of climbing, and even a fair amount of light puzzle solving. It’s almost comparable to the recent Tomb Raider trilogy. Juggling between these different types of sequences is something that the game excels at, and it’s a continuing joy to listen to Kratos’ humorously gruff brevity when attempting to interact with his hyper-curious child.Since steps were taken to ensure that Days Gone had a great PC port, God of War is also much the same. There are a wealth of options, but generally game runs quite well. Although it can drop some serious frames in larger areas, even while using stronger cards. But the game looks and plays wonderfully, and DLSS can make things a sight easier if you’re looking to keep the resolution up. Regardless, the art direction is gorgeous, as is seeing the different realms the game takes you to. Anyone that picks the game up on PC will find a truly special time awaiting them, with visuals that are much more befitting than it being locked at 30 fps and other limits of the older last-gen hardware.One of the best games of recent years gets even better, courtesy of a superb port and content that has withstood the march of time with aplomb.About Us
