Buy it Humble (opens in new tab) / Steam (opens in new tab)One of the most remarkable things about this Resident Evil 2 remake is that it makes zombies—the slow, shambling, groaning kind—exciting again. The undead in this game are incredible, horrible things: shuffling lumps of bloody meat who batter down doors, tumble through broken windows, and lunge hungrily from the shadows. They're physical and clumsy and an absolute joy to kill—if you have the ammunition to spare.Shoot a leg off and they keep coming, dragging themselves along the floor, reaching at you with pale, clawing hands. Turn a corner, and as your flashlight beam catches their glassy white eyes they screech and trudge towards you, arms outstretched, jaws slung with glistening blood. They don't sprint or explode or sprout thrashing parasites like they do in newer Resident Evil games. They just moan and lurch and grab, and there's something enjoyably back-to-basics about that—a feeling that echoes through every claustrophobic hallway of this confident remake.After the subversive, rule-breaking Resident Evil 7 (opens in new tab), with its grimy Southern Gothic aesthetic and intimate first-person horror, Resident Evil 2 is a return to a more familiar style of game. It's a remake, but it's never a slave to the source material, adding or cleverly remixing enough elements to make it feel brand new. You can still play as two characters—Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield—and a few fan favourite bosses and locations have been recreated. But even moments of fan service are given some kind of interesting twist or fresh angle, which is, honestly, not what I expected from this remake at all.Graphics options Anti-aliasing (FXAA/TAA/FXAA+TAA/SMAA), texture quality, texture filter quality (anisotropic 2-16x), subsurface scattering, contact shadows, screen space reflections, particle lighting quality, ambient occlusion (SSAO limited/SSAO full/HDAO/HBAO+), motion blur, graphics API (DX11/DX12)Performance With a GTX 1080, 16GB of RAM, and an i5-6600K overclocked to 4.0GHz I was able to play Resident Evil 2 at 1440p/60fps on almost max settings, and it ran smoothly—albeit with some judder when sprinting into a large, open area such as the RPD main hall.The grand, imposing Raccoon City Police Department was always a great setting, but the shift to three dimensions makes it magnificent. While the original game relied on fixed camera angles and the distant moan of unseen zombies to build fear, the remake uses light, shadow, and layout to get under your skin. Some parts of the station have been plunged into darkness, forcing you to pick through the gloom with a flashlight. The building itself is a labyrinth of blind corners, shadowy recesses, and warren-like corridors, creating a constant feeling of apprehension and unease.The station is essentially a giant box of puzzles, and an absence of objective markers, beyond a few marked points of interest, means you have to draft a mental map as you play. At first most of the building is locked up tight, or obstacles such as the burning wreck of a crashed helicopter block the way forward. But as you explore you find items that let you delve deeper, and slowly but surely the maze of halls, offices, atriums, and stairwells starts to feel familiar. I also like how dead zombies stay put, even after reloading a save, as I'd often use their corpses as a kind of macabre breadcrumb trail.But navigating the station and deciphering its many riddles and puzzles is only half the battle. The zombies, as much fun as they are to scrap with, can take a hell of a beating. Their health seems to be randomised, meaning that you can empty ten bullets into one and it'll keep crawling after you, while another will be put down permanently by just a few shots. And whichever dice roll governs the chance of an explosive headshot is weirdly stingy. This makes the zombies unpredictable and tenacious, as zombies should rightly be. But it also teaches you a hard lesson that every bullet in this remake is precious, and if you can slip past an enemy rather than killing it, you probably should.Then there's the Tyrant, a hulking great mutant in a trench coat (and a hat, which you can shoot off) for whom gunfire is little more than a minor inconvenience. At certain points in the game this merciless, invincible killing machine will hunt you around the station with grim persistence. You can track his movements by listening to the heavy thud of his footsteps, but other than blinding him with a flashbang, evasion is your only real option. He's also attracted to gunfire, which adds further weight to decisions involving fighting regular zombies. Do you waste ammo and risk alerting the Tyrant?Ink ribbons? ✓

The whole game is third-person, similar to Resident Evil 4, but that doesn't make exploring the RPD building any less tense.Original music? X
The remake has its own new score, but if you buy the 'Deluxe Edition' you get the option to replace it with the classic tunes.The way he walks slowly towards you, unflinching and emotionless, is genuinely unsettling—especially when he suddenly appears at the end of a long corridor. And he's always lurking near items you need to progress, which is brilliantly cruel. But I would have liked more ways to interact with him, because eventually these run-ins start to feel rather one-note, and the fear can mutate into frustration. Even the ability to throw something to distract him would have made these sections more interesting, but as it stands the concept feels underdeveloped.Similar to Resident Evil 4, the difficulty of the game adapts as you play. How it actually works is obscured, but whatever's going on behind the scenes, the balancing is quite masterful. For the entire nine hours it took me to finish my first run as Leon, I felt constantly on the verge of catastrophic failure. I always had a handful of bullets, little or no health items, and I kept wondering if I'd backed myself into an inescapable rut. But I'd always scrape through, and it's hugely impressive how the game managed to maintain this knife-edge tension from start to finish.The good news is that if you sacrifice ammo to clear an area, it'll stay clear. More zombies can spill through open windows, but you can block these up with wooden boards. This gives you some breathing room, especially when you're being chased by the Tyrant. The last thing you need is zombies clawing at you when you're trying to run to safety. Counter-weapons can also tip the balance. If you have a grenade or a combat knife in your inventory and something grabs you while you're low on health, you'll avoid death: stabbing them with the blade or shoving a grenade in their mouth. So the game isn't completely relentless in its attempts to sabotage you, but for every inch it gives you, it rudely snatches one right back.It's never really that scary, though. Unnerving, tense, and sometimes overwhelmingly stressful, sure, but there's nothing particularly understated or psychological about it. But that was always Resident Evil's thing: zombie dogs crashing loudly through windows rather than the psycho-sexual mind-beasts of Silent Hill. Still, Resident Evil 7 had some effectively surreal, eerie moments, and I would have liked some of that to make its way into this remake. If you can't deal with the stress, there is an 'assisted' difficulty option that adds generous auto-aim and makes a small amount of health regenerate automatically. But, honestly, the game just isn't very exciting when your item box is heaving with an abundance of spare shotgun shells and healing herbs.As an evolution, and a celebration, of vintage Resident Evil, you couldn't ask for much moreWhen you finish your first playthrough, you've really only seen half of what the game has to offer. The second uses the same locations and has many of the same story beats, but the puzzles are different, enemy types and locations are mixed up, and you take a different route through each of the game's three major locations. What I love about this so-called 'B' scenario is how the game uses your knowledge of the setting against you. Walking into the RPD main hall as Claire, a protected haven for Leon, and seeing zombies in there was a fun subversion. It's just a shame the intensity of the Tyrant is amped up to such a preposterous degree. He's constantly looming over your shoulder, which I ultimately found a bit annoying.As a longtime fan of the original Resident Evil 2, I enjoyed the remake's many self-aware attempts to clarify some of the more abstract stuff in the game—such as why a sewer system is powered by plugs shaped like chess pieces, or why a police station would inexplicably theme its keys and locks around playing card suits. There are other cute references to the old games to find as well, but they're pretty subtle and don't feel forced. This could have easily been a game targeted squarely at diehard fans, but if this is your first Resident Evil you could get your head around everything in minutes—another example of how refreshingly simple the remake is. The story is really no more complicated than: zombies everywhere, get to safety. Which makes even the relatively pared-down narrative of Resident Evil 7 seem overly complex.Some of the voice acting and writing are pretty bad, and not 'fun bad' like in the old PlayStation games: just regular bad. The second act, which takes place in a dingy sewer, slows the action down to a crawl. And I was glad when the section where you play as Ada Wong, solving hacking puzzles while the Tyrant stalks you, was over. But otherwise, this is pretty much the ultimate refinement of the classic Resident Evil formula—but with the added intensity of RE4's slick, dynamic over-the-shoulder combat. The result is a game that is comfortably among the best in the series, and a thrilling survival horror experience in its own right. It's not as surprising as RE7, but as an evolution, and a celebration, of vintage Resident Evil, you couldn't ask for much more.A tense, challenging, and beautiful remake of a classic survival horror game, and with enough fresh ideas to make it feel excitingly new.If it’s set in space, Andy will probably write about it. He loves sci-fi, adventure games, taking screenshots, Twin Peaks, weird sims, Alien: Isolation, and anything with a good story.Resident Evil 2 and 3 have quietly had their ray tracing options removedOriginal versions of Resident Evil remakes return to Steam after 'overwhelming community response'The Gollum collector's edition really is called the 'Precious Edition'By Phil Iwaniuk6 April 2023By Dave James5 April 2023By Kizito Katawonga4 April 2023By Jacob Ridley4 April 2023By Ian Evenden4 April 2023By Jorge Jimenez3 April 2023By Luke Winkie3 April 2023By Ted Litchfield31 March 2023By Robin Valentine31 March 2023By Katie Wickens31 March 2023By Dave James30 March 2023PC Gamer is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Resident Evil 2,Aoife Wilson,Eurogamer,https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-01-22-resident-evil-2-review,"Raccoon tale.You know you're playing a good Resident Evil game when you need to keep a pen and a piece of scrap paper close at hand. Sitting on the first open page of my notepad, in a frantic scrawl, are rudimentary diagrams with numbers sticking out at odd angles, repeating three letter codes, bizarre rune patterns, abbreviated riddles, safe-cracking combinations, random running tallies, and then sometimes just the odd word, number or phrase followed with a bemused question mark. Lion statue? Stained glass? Locker room? Keypad? This is the frenzied, stream of consciousness-style note-taking of someone deep down a Resident Evil rabbit hole. As an old-school Resident Evil fan, I couldn't be happier. Calling this modern Resident Evil 2 a remake feels like an undersell. Yes, it's a faithful recreation of the 1998 survival horror classic, but it has been rebuilt completely from the ground up, resurrecting iconic locations like the Raccoon City Police Station using Resident Evil 7's RE Engine. And the RPD has never looked better. From the detailed character models and animations to the way your quivering torchlight illuminates the glistening entrails of what used to be a cop, this game looks incredible. Certain elements of the art museum-turned-police station have been reshuffled and reimagined to make sense in a photorealistic environment and for a modern audience, but though this is not the police station as it was in the original Resident Evil 2, it's the police station as you remember it. A grand gilded entrance hall making way for a dozen twisted corridors and antechambers, layered and meted out through keys and trinkets that only get more bizarre as the story continues. The zombies and the corporate espionage are all well and good, but the original game was memorable in a good part due to the station's starring role as both your place of refuge and your prison. Despite the change from fixed camera angles to a third-person over the shoulder perspective, it's a testament to the layout that locations still manage to be both claustrophobic and oppressive. Even the larger, more open spaces like the main police station reception aren't wasted, as these are often put to use by giving you line of sight to a pursuing enemy as you try to shake them on your way through to another interconnecting hallway. You do get a good feel for where everything is after a few loops around the building, but even veteran players would be lost without the map screen, which mercifully logs all the most pertinent information as you play, including the locations of items you've seen but haven't picked up, safes or lockers you've yet to crack open, windows you've boarded and doors that have yet to be unlocked, along with which key or item you need to open them up. It's one of the places the game's lineage shines through most and you're going to need to get on board with the micromanagement of it all - regularly casting back to your map screen, flipping through in-game files, opening up your inventory to examine items and find clues as to their usefulness. A feature that very much comes in handy but in hindsight I think I relied upon a little too much is the game's habit of marking a room red on the map when it still has secrets for you to uncover, and blue once you've squeezed it for every last item or ammo clip it's hiding. You can get into a bad habit of constantly flipping back and checking the status of this colour-co-ordination on the map screen instead of simply exploring things at your own pace, but it's also worth bearing in mind that files and various other reading materials are often crucial for seeing Resident Evil's bigger picture, and these do not show up on the map in any shape or form - you just have to keep your eyes peeled for them yourself. No matter how well you explore, how many enemies you defeat and how many puzzles you solve, however, the game will still have more surprises up its sleeve by the time you first see the credits roll. Upon starting your game of Resident Evil 2, you'll be asked which character you'd like to play as - rookie cop Leon S. Kennedy or obscenely capable college student Claire Redfield. Seeing the campaign through as either one or the other, you'll be meeting unique characters, fighting different enemies and wielding specialist weapons. Upon completing that campaign, you'll be prompted to begin a New Game '2nd Run,' a follow-up scenario featuring the other character where the ending and certain parts of the game have been changed. It's only after completing this second run that you'll get the 'true ending' of the game, and after this second play through you'll also unlock The Fourth Survivor mode and the 2nd Run scenario for your first character. So, just like the original Resident Evil 2, you can play up to four full length campaigns with varying enemy placements and puzzle solutions every time. The story beats don't vary wildly between first and second run-throughs with the same characters (and the locations don't really vary at all), but there are subtle differences here and there. Combine this with additional challenges to unlock bonus assets and artwork and a hardcore difficulty featuring stronger enemies and the need to use an ink ribbon consumable item to save, means there's plenty to keep classic Resident Evil fans coming back for third or fourth helpings. For reference, it took me roughly seven hours to complete both my first and second campaign, first as Claire and then as Leon. The divergent story paths will take you through pretty much the exact same areas, particularly in the latter half of the game, but Resident Evil 2 makes sure to switch up the gameplay with different weapons, different key item placements and different puzzle solutions. Most situations, in other words, will not be exactly as you first experienced them (except for, oddly, safe code combinations, which carry over wholesale into 2nd run playthroughs). Both Claire and Leon's scenarios flesh out their individual storylines, but in a new addition to this retelling both Ada Wong and Sherry Birkin are playable for short sections this time around during Leon and Claire's campaigns respectively. Ada's sequence is a little more involved than her playable section in the original game and features a unique hacking gadget that sounds great in theory but isn't all that fun to wield, while Sherry plays an elaborate game of Hide and Seek in a spooky orphanage - as if there's any other kind. These are only very brief detours from the main campaigns they feature in and mechanically, each is very hit and miss in its own way, and yet they both serve as a welcome palate cleanser and quick change of pace to the central campaign. Playing as Claire and Leon, your time is split between navigating your way around and away from lunging enemies, exercising an itchy, tasty trigger finger when necessary and using your capable yet delicious brains to advance deeper into the city of the dead. As a practiced zombie-killer, I of course know that the fastest way to an efficient kill is with a headshot, but often, even with the most basic fodder in Resident Evil 2, one or even two headshots isn't enough to bring them down permanently. This means that even on standard difficulty, you'll soon find that there are far more enemies than you have bullets, so often you may have to swallow your pride and simply run away. If the zombie is somewhere you'll be passing through with any kind of regularity, however, like a police station thoroughfare, you'll want to at least immobilise them to an extent, by taking off their legs and/or arms.There's a definite sadistic pleasure to be had in this, too - as satisfying as it is to land a perfect headshot right between the eyes, the act of popping off a zombie's limbs one by one and seeing them fall with a wet slop onto the polished marble floor of the police station reception offers its own grim fun. It's a small act of genius that this game allows you to move and shoot, as you'd expect from any modern third person action title, but in a subtle callback to the game's survival horror roots, shooting is refined this time out in that by standing still for a few seconds, the reticule tightens to a pinpoint and you become far more accurate. It's a way of honouring the series' past without sacrificing the kind of gunplay we're used to in 2019, and this Resident Evil 2 is filled with similar smart tweaks, where things have been refined and reframed, but the spirit of survival horror is left very much intact.Of course, with some enemies, running is and was always the only option. The Tyrant T-00 (just like in the original, he's never referred to as Mr X in-game) is a formidable foe, but he won't stalk you for the entirety of Resident Evil 2, as some players initially feared. There are certain portions he'll show up for and certainly stress you out during, but this mechanic doesn't outstay its welcome, nor does it definitively block curious players from exploring every inch of the RPD at their own leisure. He's still a horribly imposing and unpredictable presence, though there are moments it does feel unfair that when cornered by him in a dead-end corridor, there's no way to avoid him taking a swing at you other than unloading a couple of bullets into his head to momentarily stun him. Part of Resident Evil's challenge is weighing up the risk versus reward of travelling back through an infested area knowing full well that you may well end up having to use a healing item or spend more bullets than you can technically afford. That is, of course, part of the game's long-lasting appeal and though this Resident Evil 2 is a beautiful and at times incredibly modern-feeling game, beneath its new and impeccably polished trappings you can still feel the beating heart of the classic and increasingly aged framework it's built on. But that framework is precisely what made the original Resident Evil 2 such a stone cold classic, and though some story beats have been streamlined and some gameplay mechanics have been embellished or added to, this is a reimagining that sticks remarkably close to its source material. Even better, it toes the line between schlocky and scary that the older Resident Evil games managed so well, and does so in perhaps one of the most atmospheric settings ever to grace a survival horror game. It's good to be back in the RPD. Just be sure to bring a pen and paper with you. You're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!

I’m also sure I developed an entirely new dimensional plane of swearing at several points. This lovingly-crafted remake perfectly recaptures what made the original great, which is mainly putting you in a small room with too many monsters and not enough bullets; seesawing from tense exploratory poking through dark blood stained corridors one minute, to oh so much screaming and flailing the next.    Resident Evil 2 guide (opens in new tab) | Best Resident Evil 2 guns (opens in new tab) |Resident Evil 2 Mr Raccoon locations | Resident Evil 2 Safe codes (opens in new tab) | Resident Evil 2 locker codes (opens in new tab) | How to get the Resident Evil 2 shotgun and grenade launcher (opens in new tab) | Resident Evil 2 Film Roll locations (opens in new tab) | Resident Evil 2 key locations (opens in new tab)| Resident Evil 2 medallion locations (opens in new tab)| How to solve the Resident Evil 2 chess plug puzzle (opens in new tab) | Find the Resident evil 2 hip pouch locations (opens in new tab)What’s good about this modern reincarnation is how it honours all the original’s ideas but builds on it using today's gaming capabilities and vocabulary, taking the essence of the 1996 PS1 era Resident Evil and making it feel like it was always on PS4. Just as in the original this follows rookie cop Leon S Kennedy and motorcycling student Claire Redfield as they get caught up in zombie outbreak and uncover the truth behind the pharmaceutical company, Umbrella, that's responsible for it. The plot, characters and locations are all largely the same, the Remake has just spruced up the looks, camera and gameplay to better suit today’s 4K standards. As you’d hope, the zombies are the real stars here. They moan, they shuffle, they peel: skin sloughing off and cracked bones releasing broken limbs to the floor as flesh stretches and snaps. A few well-placed bullets leave wet, schlepping meat bags that relentlessly drag themselves towards you. It’s beautifully horrific, creating some of the best undead I’ve seen in anything for a while. It captures both the obvious and immediate threat of a ravenous undying corpse, and the sad sight of a broken, roadkill mess of meat dragging itself pitifully towards you; mewing as a useless jaw works for a meal it can never reach. I’ve wasted so much time just watching them scrape around, just to enjoy the spectacle. Or to see just how much damage they can actually take. (If you’re interested it’s possible to have a zombie with no arms and legs that still writhes on the floor trying to reach you.) Other, more dangerous monsters, like the Licker (a predatory, skinless beasts with a lengthy, razor sharp tongue) are just as terrifying but will always play second fiddle to the true stars of the series. When the undead aren’t jumping out at you, or leaving a trail of themselves as they advance, they add a persistent tension by their unpredictable inability to completely die. Corpses can lie, unmoving for hours, on the floor, all but forgotten until you hear an ‘Uhrrrrrrrrr’ in the dark and the sound of something getting up. It creates a constant unease that bubbles in the background of the quieter sections - long moments of peace that lull you into a false sense of security just long enough to mess you up. Because you’ve got limited supplies - scarce reserves of ammo and healing - it forces you to think carefully about how you deal with threats. For the most part you’ll be balancing careful resource management, jump scares and the tense, unpleasant promise of a new, dark room - all of which can collapse into chaos with one misstep or when the indestructible Tyrant appears, stomping relentlessly after you. All those undead you thought you’d save a bullet on suddenly become obstacles as you panic, and it’s moments like that you really get a sense of just how likely you’d be able to survive an actual zombie apocalypse. In the first half the atmosphere this creates is wonderfully macabre and jumpy, full of classic Ghost Train-style scares you totally knew were coming as you trundle along its rails. The initial police station is a beautifully crafted area full of blood splattered walls, debris strewn corridors and smashed windows, creating a pensive atmosphere as your narrating torch tells a story with questioning sweeps. Then something moves in the shadows and there’s shooting, yelling and frantic searches for an exit - at times Resident Evil 2 Remake plays like the best season of The Walking Dead we’ve had in a long time. As you crisscross the game’s various areas repeatedly to solve things and open doors you realise what an intricately designed puzzle box it all is. Rather than opening Door 1 and moving on to Door 2, this is more about discovering Object A exists, and that it opens Cupboard X, which gets you Thing B that, when examined, pops out Key ‘Who the fuck designed this?’ for Door C waaaay back where you found the first thing. This interlocking design loops back and forth across the map, expanding and accessing new areas with each step you make in the right direction. It rarely wears out its welcome either, because everything is so compact and efficiently laid out. You get lost occasionally, scanning the in-game map searching for some clue or corner you’ve missed, but rarely for long and the challenge is always a rewarding one when that light bulb goes off. The opening intricacy of the Police Station is a peak though. The later areas have a similar sense of design and are great to explore and work out, but lack the scale and finesse by comparison. As you progress, levels decrease in size and complexity, which does help to keep the focus and pace up but also feels like the later stages were curtailed in some way. For example, there are Blue Herbs scattered throughout the entire game that can cure poisoning, which is an effect that literally only happens in one single room. Were there more reasons to have them originally?As with the original game you’ll need to play through twice to see everything, as completing the game with one character opens up a slightly altered playthrough with the other. You’ll get different weapons, altered puzzles and new cutscenes, as well as skipping or swapping some sections and steps to speed things up. Both Both Leon and Claire have different secondary characters they encounter, with their own playable sections. So there’s enough new stuff and variation to make a replay feel fresh. Plus what you learn from the first time around radically changed your approach and awareness when you go back. 12 essential Resident Evil 2 Remake tips (opens in new tab) to know before you playIn terms of other callbacks honouring the old games the boss fights are still… well, basically a bit shit. The slow, methodical controls that work so well in fostering a sense of manageable vulnerability against zombies become fumblingly sluggish against faster moving enemies and bosses. In those scenario it’s less about vulnerability and more about howling at the screen as your character corners like a Roomba stuck on a rug and fails to dodge a huge swiping claw from off screen. Classic Resident Evil has always been a bit like that though, making these encounters more about taking a couple of goes to get the ‘trick’ you need to win rather than pulling off a slick set of moves. There’s also one encounter involving a swinging shipping container that’s a disaster. It takes place in a tiny area barely bigger than the monster you’re fighting and really highlights the limits of the controls.But one kink doesn’t kill a classic and it’s interesting to see how much of the old game comes through. Limited movement that leaves you exposed, scant resources and meticulous puzzle solving layers are all mainstays of the original and after the total reinvention of Resident Evil 7’s first person reboot this proves that those ideas still have legs.

Resident Evil 2,Ben Reeves,Game Informer,https://www.gameinformer.com/Resident%20Evil%202%20game%20informer%20Review,"For more than a decade, Resident Evil has felt like a franchise struggling to find its identity. The seminal Resident Evil 4 put a greater focus on action, but subsequent entries lost their luster. Resident Evil 7 was a major course correction but still felt like a radical reinvention that was finding its footing. Fortunately, Capcom might have finally found the magic once again. This brilliant homage to Resident Evil 2 not only revitalizes many of the survival horror elements that put Resident Evil on the map, it paves a brilliant path for the future of the franchise.In its era, Resident Evil 2 was the pinnacle of survival horror. While the original Resident Evil established a formula, its sequel raised the stakes in nearly every way with tense exploration and nail-biting action. In 1998, Resident Evil 2’s action was as intense as its atmosphere was horrifying, so it became a benchmark for PS One horror. Unfortunately, Capcom’s classic has aged about as poorly as a zombie-eaten corpse.Capcom’s remake gives Racoon City a much-needed facelift, but a new third-person perspective does even more to update Resident Evil’s action. This remake returns to the series’ slower-paced roots. Thankfully, slowing down the shootouts doesn’t diminish Resident Evil’s intensity. On the contrary, Resident Evil’s action feels better than it has in years, and its smooth shooter controls are incredibly intuitive. Zombies shamble forward like herky-jerky wind-up toys. These animations are unnerving, but they also create an exciting metagame in which you must time your shots perfectly to hit these brain eaters in the brainpan. If you miss your shot, they keep stumbling forward, meaning that even two flanking zombies can pose a challenge if you’re off your A-game.Resident Evil 2’s new visuals also create a darker, more haunting vibe. For those who think Resident Evil has lost its teeth, Resident Evil 2 might be the most intense game in the series. The original Resident Evil 2’s bold colors look cartoonish today, but the remake’s atmosphere is foreboding. Zombie heads pop in a sickening shower of brain bits. Grotesque body horrors skitter across the walls and ceilings. The station’s halls echo with steady footfalls. I normally have an incredibly steady hand, but Resident Evil 2 had me jumping at shadows, and I couldn’t escape the feeling of being stalked.Resident Evil 2 is also much more than a remake. In a lot of important ways, this feels like a brand-new experience. Fans will recognize locations within Racoon City’s police department and its sprawling sewer system, but Capcom cleverly reworked the entire layout so they feel fresh. Many of the environmental puzzles are more realistic, and moments like rewiring an electrical grid or looking for environmental clues to a combination lock offer a refreshing break from the action.Another big change from the original game is the removal of the zapping system. In the PlayStation original, players’ actions with one character could affect events in a second playthrough with the other character. While the zapping system is gone, this modern update has a mode called 2nd Run, which allows you to play through the campaign a second time with the other character. These two campaigns don’t talk to each other as in the PlayStation game, but 2nd Run challenges you to take a different path through the station and gives you a few new tools to use in the process, such as a rapid-fire revolver that burns through high-grade ammo. Leon and Claire’s stories are also very different, so this feature adds extra incentive to play through the game a second time. Fortunately, both playthroughs felt significantly different, and I was excited to see what happened to both protagonists.Over the years, Capcom has experimented with several different approaches to Resident Evil, but this is one approach I hope gets revisited. Resident Evil 2 not only looks great, it plays well, and it forces you into a series of dark encounters that are a total rush. Resident Evil is finally running on all cylinders.

   on January 28, 2019 at 8:01AM PSTReliving familiar frights can often make for a less-than-exciting horror experience. But with the remake of Resident Evil 2, Capcom shows respect for the original while also going to great lengths to give the macabre atmosphere and tense gameplay a noticeable upgrade. In doing so, this revamp of the classic survival horror game shows that the series can still offer a terrifying experience like no other.You once again play as either Leon Kennedy or Claire Redfield. A viral outbreak has unleashed hordes of zombies and other grotesque monsters upon Raccoon City, leading to a series of dangerous and nightmare-inducing encounters for the two characters. While both protagonists' storylines have similar plots and take place in the same locations, there are different supporting characters and unique challenges in each that set the two playthroughs apart.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Resident Evil 2 Video ReviewIn traditional Resident Evil fashion, you're tasked with surviving through the night and overcoming the nightmarish creatures and devious puzzles found throughout the infested streets of the city, the tight, dimly lit halls of the Police Station, and in the subterranean passages below. RE2 is a great mix of the understated survivalist approach from the original games and the tactile, reflex-oriented gameplay from more recent entries. It's very much a game about escalation; as your resources dwindle and the monsters become fearsome and more elaborate, the pressure is always mounting as the story progresses, and each moment feels just a bit more desperate than the last. Even the smallest of victories can feel like major wins in RE2, and you'll often find yourself onto the next struggle before you know it.While those who played the original game will enter with an idea of what's to come, the remake does a lot to refresh certain encounters and locations. Though many locales and their layouts are similar--save for the addition of a brand-new area and a new monster to deal with--the events therein are new. Jump scares don't trigger when you expect them to, or a room that once spelled certain doom in your head is now a safe haven--but then the question arises: if this room is safe, which room is the real dangerous one?Early Resident Evil games have a reputation for being melodramatic, often unintentionally, but the RE2 remake a more serious tone that makes for a more evocative story. While there is still the undercurrent of the hokey tone from the classics, with the characters cutting the tension with humor when appropriate, the remake's narrative is far more convincing, propped up by some impressive writing and strong performances that help convey urgency and despair. This is especially evident during the more quiet moments, when the protagonists will try to psych themselves up for what's to come. Even minor characters are given additional substance in the remake, with poignant moments given to the doomed police lieutenant Marvin Branagh and gun shop owner Robert Kendo.Both Claire and Leon have two different versions of the campaign, and after finishing the first run for one, you'll be prompted to start a follow-up with the other. Called Second Scenarios, they allow you to see the larger story from a different perspective. Both scenarios are totally isolated from another, and choices therein won't impact the other, but what makes these second runs worthwhile are the different encounters and sub-plots that don't occur in the first. It's a very interesting way to experience the narrative, and with four versions of the campaigns between the two leads--with the first two averaging 12-15 hours--you constantly uncover new details and events that weren't present in the previous playthroughs.Resident Evil 2's more serious tone is further enhanced by the renewed, fantastically atmospheric presentation, which gives familiar details from the classic game more of a pronounced look and feel. Moving away from the static camera angles of the original, everything has been redesigned with over-the-shoulder gameplay in mind, giving more of a palpable and invasive sense of dread when exploring. This is heightened even more by the impeccable audio and visual design of the game, creating an eerie, isolating vibe throughout. In a number of cases, you'll only have the illumination of your flashlight as you walk the dark hallways of the bloody and ruined police station, with the ambient rain and distant monster sounds ramping up the tension. You rarely feel safe in RE2, even when you actually are.The remake's impressive level of detail is consistently noticeable, but especially so during gorey moments. These gruesome encounters channel the same macabre and staccato approach from the classics, but are now honed through the visual luster of modern rendering and animation. As the zombies are the one constant threat throughout, you quickly become accustomed to seeing flesh chip away as you fire off pistol shots, along with watching the undead torn in half by well-placed shotgun blasts. Though RE2 easily proves to be the goriest game of the series, it never comes off as excessive, and the grizzly details all serve to highlight the grim circumstances of the desperate situation.Resident Evil 2's more serious tone is further enhanced by the renewed, fantastically atmospheric presentation...At the beginning, your meager selection of weapons doesn't seem like a match for the game's most intimidating horrors, but there are means available that can give you the upper hand in a lopsided fight. In addition to dismembering enemies with well-aimed shots hindering zombies' speed and offense, you can barricade certain windows to block ravenous undead from entering from outside. While many of these options are simply a temporary solution to a long-term problem, which can make it seem like they're not all that worth taking advantage of, they are helpful in a pinch.While you will no doubt settle into tactics that work well, RE2 throws in some fresh challenges. In one of the game's more tense encounters, you cross paths with the Tyrant, a hulking presence whose footsteps echo throughout the environment. Though it was a serious foe shown in small doses in the original, this imposing force of nature is now more of a persistent threat that actively stalks you during key periods in the story. Simply ducking into another room isn't enough, as it'll quickly follow you in to keep the chase going--similar to the RE3's Nemesis in that regard. If you manage to create enough distance and it loses line of sight, it'll disengage, but will remain lurking throughout the halls. With this dynamic, the Tyrant also makes the common foes you've gotten a handle of become genuine threats once again. As you find yourself trying to stay focused on the stalking figure, it's all too easy to round a corner and run into a group of zombies.Though the Tyrant offers a nerve-wracking surprise during some of these key moments, which makes the feeling of getting the best of it all the more satisfying, there are other times when it can disrupt Resident Evil 2's pacing. This is especially frustrating when you're simply trying to acquire an item or solve a puzzle in a room that the Tyrant and zombies frequent. What should be tense encounters can sometimes become annoying exercises in trying to lure it away, and in some cases it comes off like you're taking advantage of the Tyrant's rather limited AI to do just that. The Tyrant can overstay its welcome, but in most cases, its presence is a constant reminder of the looming threat throughout the game.While RE2 often keeps things serious, it's not all doom and gloom. In addition to occasional references that break the tension, there's also a suite of unlockable content available to the delight of RE fans, including the classic RE2 outfits for both Leon and Claire. After completing the campaign for both characters, you'll unlock a set of bonus modes starring fan-favorites Hunk and Tofu, the later of which is a sentient knife-wielding block of coagulated soy. Both of these extra modes take you on timed gauntlets battling through many intense encounters, with Tofu's mode being the most difficult scenario in the entire game. They also allow for a chance to cut loose against hordes of monsters without the worry of the larger survival-horror mechanics during the main game.Resident Evil 2 is not only a stellar remake of the original, but it's also simply a strong horror game that delivers anxiety-inducing and grotesque situations, topping some of the series' finest entries. But above all, the remake is an impressive game for the fact that it goes all-in on the pure survival horror experience, confidently embracing its horrifying tone and rarely letting up until the story's conclusion. Though Resident Evil 2 has its roots firmly in the past, it reworks the familiar horrors into something that feels brand new and all its own.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"
Resident Evil 2,Michael McWhertor,Polygon,https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/1/22/18192509/resident-evil-2-remake-review,"Filed under:Capcom has remade Resident Evil 2 into something exciting, new, and nostalgicCapcom hasn’t always understood what makes Resident Evil great. Maybe it has never consistently, fully grasped the thing that it has on its hands.That’s been evident since the original Resident Evil 2, which was famously scrapped and restarted well into its development, ultimately becoming a beloved follow-up to a genre-defining game. After that 1998 PlayStation game, however, Capcom’s zombie series has wavered. Resident Evil 4 was a revelation. Its immediate successors, not so much. But the outstanding Resident Evil 7 showed that Capcom had the thoughtfulness to reflect on what made the franchise so beloved in the first place.Polygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences.

If you want curated lists of our favorite media, check out What to Play and What to Watch.Capcom took Resident Evil 7’s design decisions to heart in its remake of Resident Evil 2, which has not been simply polished with slick graphics for modern consoles and computers, but has been completely remade inside and out. It’s no mean feat; the developers of the new Resident Evil 2 have carefully threaded a needle with their new version of a very old thing. Capcom has woven modern mechanics into its groundbreaking sequel, never abandoning what is truly great about the first Resident Evil 2. The result is a fresh, expensive-looking game that evokes the best memories of the PlayStation original, while also being something altogether new.The new Resident Evil 2 begins just like its now-primitive ancestor: Rookie cop Leon Kennedy and college student Claire Redfield trek to the town of Raccoon City in search of answers. The two are united by a chance encounter but quickly separated by a terrible accident. What follows is a fight for survival as both Claire and Leon try to escape the city alive, then find themselves caught up in something much bigger.Resident Evil 2’s main setting, a police station, should be a safe haven for its heroes. It should be stockpiled with weapons, ammunition, and survival gear, the perfect place to wait out a zombie apocalypse. But Claire and Leon arrive weeks into Raccoon City’s ordeal. The entirety of the city’s police force is either dead, zombified, or on the brink of death. Supplies have been expended. The halls run slick with blood. Corpses — it’s unclear if they’re truly dead or reanimated — lay piled around every corner. It is immediately terrifying.The walking dead stalk me through the station — during my first playthrough as Leon — from room to room. They break through windows and doors, upending my expectations about how Resident Evil’s zombies are supposed to behave. I shoot them in the head, missing every third shot because of their unpredictable bobbleheaded movements, but they don’t stay down for long. I’m wasting ammo, constantly. I curse the zombies. I curse my aim. Leon curses too, annoyed or frightened that headshots aren’t working. Rooms I think are clear of threats are somehow inhabited by new zombies when I return to search for something I missed.Resident Evil 2 quickly forces me to get back to behaviors I learned in 1998. Conserve ammo. Run away when I can. Hack at a zombie with a knife until I’m 100 percent sure that thing isn’t getting back up again.The game’s bizarre puzzles likewise take me back to that time. I sprint from room to room in search of a diamond-shaped key for a diamond-shaped lock. I develop rolls of film that reveal a single picture of a padlock combination. A half-eaten police officer dies with a notebook in his hand. The book contains the solution to an elaborate, station-spanning puzzle that requires three medallions culled from three marble statues — and, ludicrously, it’s my only hope of getting out of this place.How does Resident Evil 2 justify all this? Raccoon City’s police department is actually a renovated art museum, and its architect — either a certified genius or an authentic wacko — has devised this series of convoluted puzzles that stand between me and survival. Resident Evil’s puzzles have felt natural in games where the settings were dark-and-stormy-night haunted houses, but set against the background of a municipal police station, they are absurd. I enjoy completing them immensely.While the game’s many puzzles root Resident Evil 2 to its past, virtually everything else is gloriously modernized. Claire and Leon no longer move like tanks, but like modern video game action heroes in third-person view. The police station is beautifully, gruesomely realized. Some rooms are dark as night, lit only by the blaze of Claire’s or Leon’s flashlight. Emergency lighting reflects off the water in flooded hallways. There is trash and rot in the attics, piled-up office furniture blocking pathways, and it’s all very realistic-looking. Claire and Leon themselves look like real human beings, slickly rendered. They become sweaty, dirty, and bloody. They shoot like regular human beings, though, with imperfect aim. On Resident Evil 2’s standard difficulty, there is no aim assistance, a very modern video game convenience that I miss terribly every time I waste precious ammo shooting wildly at zombies. In my second playthrough, as Claire, I play on “assisted” mode, which adds generous aim assistance and automatically regenerating health. Resident Evil 2 is almost too easy, but very enjoyable, on this lower difficulty setting. A “hardcore” mode is available too. It brings with it the requirement that you save the game using ink ribbons — a finite resource — at typewriters, and other punishments I can’t bring myself to endure yet. To play Resident Evil 2 requires a throbbing, constant stress, and to return to ink ribbons at this stage, without having memorized the placement of every item scattered throughout the game, is too much.But Resident Evil 2 begs to be played multiple times over. As with the original version of the game, Capcom has created distinct scenarios for both Claire and Leon. They meet different people on their journey, battle monsters unique to them, and see the story play out in very different ways. I was pleasantly surprised at just how much had changed, and how fresh each side of Resident Evil 2’s story felt from their different perspectives. They each get a “second run” scenario too, so if you complete the game with Leon, you’ll be able to see what Claire was busying herself with during his adventure, and vice versa. Those second runs play out as more condensed horror stories, and each contains its own surprises. Each scenario was worth the time I spent with it.Where Resident Evil 2 falters is when the game gives you control of people that aren’t Claire or Leon. A pair of interludes starring supporting characters Ada Wong and Sherry Birkin offer ostensibly new perspectives, but both are bogged down by dull, trial-and-error tasks. While both characters are essential to the plot, their playable scenarios are unfortunate speed bumps on an otherwise thrumming horror story.Outside of those interruptions, Resident Evil 2 is everything a video game remake should be. It’s faithful in tone and story to its source material, while updating a classic in meaningful ways. It’s exciting in the ways that Resident Evil used to be, when the games were driven not by explosive set-pieces, but a constant sensation of high tension.Umbrella, the sinister corporation at the heart of the horrors in the Resident Evil games, has never exhibited total control over its creations. That’s a lesson at the heart of Resident Evil 2, in which a virus runs amok, culminating in the destruction of Umbrella’s own underground lair — where those zombie-making viruses were conceived.Capcom, on a far less dangerous scale, has not always known how to handle its own creation. After mutating from quaint horror to buffoonish action to back again, the Resident Evil series has been wildly inconsistent. But back-to-back Resident Evil games that showcase the very best of survival horror is evidence that Capcom may have its monster under control. Resident Evil 2 is available Jan. 25 for PlayStation 4, Windows PC, and Xbox One. The game was reviewed using a final “retail” Xbox One download code provided by Capcom.

Resident Evil 2,Heather Alexandra,Kotaku,https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-2-the-kotaku-review-1831951036,"There’s a lot to love about the new Resident Evil 2, from its brash bloodiness to the wide variety of experiences packed into the game. Looking over the wreckage of my playthroughs, my own feelings are complicated. It is an exciting and astounding experience, but it feels compromised. Pushes towards modernization through changes to the camera and controls lessen the sense of dread of the original, and the presentation suffers without returning actors to tie it into the larger franchise. It has many excellent parts, but it sometimes struggles to cohere into a satisfying whole.This piece originally appeared 1/22/19. We’ve bumped it today for the game’s release.When the original Resident Evil debuted in 1996, it helped codify a new genre of games. Combining cinematic camera cuts and resilient enemies, it wove a masterful tapestry of isolation and alienation. Its sequel, Resident Evil 2, increased the level of action. As director Hideki Kamiya took charge over Shinji Mikami, an increased emphasis on combat altered how the series approached horror. Resident Evil 2 was not a game of isolation. It was about being overwhelmed. Rushing around a corner could leave the player face to face with numerous zombies. It was a game of deliberate decision-making, of knowing when to commit to combat and when to avoid it.""Jesus Christ, stay back!""Prestige Television RemakeDeliciously bloody, good puzzles, and it's genuinely terrifying to be hunted.Gameplay changes sometimes make things too easy. Certain segments drag on too long.CapcomPS4 (Played), Xbox One, PCLeon's story took about eight hours, Claire's was roughly three. Around 14 hours total with extras and restarts.That 1998 PlayStation sequel has been remade by Kazunori Kadoi and a team of Capcom veterans for a new modern Resident Evil 2 that changes its camera angles and expands parts of the original. These changes give players more control but that sometimes erodes the original version’s tension. It’s a different kind of experience, full of action, gore, and grit but not always as anxiety-inducing.Resident Evil 2 takes place in the zombie-infested Raccoon City. The story follows rookie cop Leon Kennedy and college student Claire Redfield, who is looking for her brother, Resident Evil protagonist Chris Redfield. Leon is drawn into the path of a mysterious femme fatale. Claire takes charge and tries to protect a child. Their stories intersect—players experience one story, then play the other character’s perspective—creating a tapestry of one night’s events in Raccoon City.The remake keeps this narrative frame, but its most radical change presents all of the action in a new camera angle. The early Resident Evil games presented their scenes from fixed camera angles with pre-rendered backgrounds, pulling the camera out to make the player feel smaller or even moving outside of locations to emulate the monster’s perspective. Turning a corner could mean a smash cut to a new angle showing half a dozen zombies. These movements helped create a sense of space and mounting tension. The remake loses a lot of this by moving the camera behind the characters’ shoulders in a perspective that resembles the revolutionary Resident Evil 4 and many modern third-person action games. When this first occurred in RE4, it opened the series to a creative renaissance. Here, it helps evoke the original game’s move towards action but in giving players more control over their characters and centering those characters prominently in the camera frame at all times, the game loses some of the 1998 version’s unease. Changing the camera is a well-motivated attempt to evoke the original game’s action bent, but it has some side effects. It is easy—too easy—to feel powerful in Resident Evil 2, as both the cameras and controls encourage a confident push forward that the original did not always compel. While the Racoon Police Department is dark and foreboding it never feels as harrowing as it did in the original.The remake instead adds tension by making its zombie hordes a resilience and menace unlike anything seen in the series before. Even when playing at the easiest setting, the player needs up to three shots to a zombie’s skull to dispatch of them. Once fallen, zombies can quickly rise again. You might use several bullets to clear a tight pathway only to find your foes have risen again by the time you come around for a return trip. The tougher enemies are initially interesting to fight, but I missed the tension that came from the larger crowds of enemies that swarmed players in the original.This Resident Evil 2 remake, like the original, is generous with ammo. At least on the default difficulty. Players will find themselves able to dispatch most of their enemies to the point of a final death, but their propensity for soaking up bullets also means there will be rooms players avoid because they are too constricted and there are too few bullets remaining.The core aesthetic behind this remake  is a push toward high-fidelity gore and violence. This is not a game for the squeamish, as zombies enthusiastically rip off pieces of flesh, characters have their skulls caved in, and shotguns blast bodies apart. The richness of Resident Evil 2’s viscera helps propel combat. Assaulting a zombie’s flank with knife slashes might result in a sliced off arm while a Licker’s slash could leave a long-lasting gash on your character until they heal. The wounds you are inflicting or that are inflicted upon you give Resident Evil 2’s familiar gameplay a raw tangibility. That helps ground the player in a space and makes threats feel real, but the graphical fidelity is undermined by the game’s controls and the enemies’ lack of intelligence. The player will find that they’re just too capable for these zombies to deal with even as mistakes are punished with bloody death.Claire and Leon can run at a fair speed, snap their guns up quickly for firing, and even have the ability to quickly turn around with a simple button press. Enemies might be bullet sponges but they are easy to avoid or else sneak around. It might be unsettling the first few times a zombie shrieks and identifies your position, but after the fiftieth time running around them, the luster long wears off. The early Resident Evils, including the first version of this game, had so-called “tank controls” that reduced characters’ mobility and enhanced the players’ terror. The new camera angle in the remake increases the agility and decreases the horror. Even when the game introduces Lickers, highly mutated albeit blind monsters, it never quite manages to truly instill horror thanks to how much control the player has over their characters.Alongside plentiful ammo and a lack of isolating camera angles, the early portions of the game are simply not as scary as they could be. Instead of watching confused characters adapt to a terrifying situation, it’s all too easy to feel like a familiar third-person action protagonist. Though this remake is initially less scary than the source material, the original game’s best twist returns and is more frightening than ever.About a third into the game, Mr. X arrives and the entire dynamic changes. (Skip the next three paragraphs if you don’t want to know what that entails.) Mr. X is a Tyrant, a special bioweapon meant to wreak havoc and withstand the toughest conditions. He is dropped into Raccoon City to find a sample of the virus causing the zombie outbreak and he decides that you have it. His arrival into the police station radically alters Resident Evil 2. He will follow you everywhere, chasing you from room to room until he can grab you by the neck and snap your bones. If you elude him, the chase is merely postponed as he wanders the area searching for you. He cannot be killed, although he can be stunned with enough damage. I’ve watched him shrug off high powered handgun rounds and continue to march after being doused with flamethrower fluid. The only time he staggered quickly was when I smashed two acid grenades against his face. That might buy you time to escape but it does you little good when you’re still desperately searching for that last key item.Mr. X breaks the rules, and that rule breaking is Resident Evil 2’s greatest trick. Until this point, zombies are not able to enter safe rooms or breach into the main hall of the police department. Mr. X does whatever he wants, and the moment I learned that is forever burned into my gaming memory. I was waiting in the main hall’s second floor, outside of the library. I needed to enter in order to solve a puzzle where I pushed bookshelves to make a bridge over a broken balcony. Wherever Mr. X walks, he stomps his feet with a tremendous weight. He doesn’t have footsteps. He leaves mini-earthquakes. Behind the library door, I heard him stomp as he looked for me. So I decided to wait until he left. For a moment, the steps died down and then the door opened. Mr. X marched into the main hall, into the space that Resident Evil 2 had stressed was safe, and began to chase me.It was brilliant and horrifying all at once. Like getting chased by Jack Baker in Resident Evil 7 or enduring the ever-possible ambushes of Resident Evil 3’s titular Nemesis, there’s a great sense of disempowerment that comes from being plagued with an implacable foe. Resident Evil 2 almost uniformly empowers the player elsewhere, but that changes whenever Mr. X is around. Knowing that there is no safe spot, knowing that he will find you and you will need to deal with him is panic-inducing. While he sometimes can feel more like nuisance than menace—especially when you simply want to finish a puzzle—his inclusion and the execution therein helps elevate Resident Evil 2 to a genuinely terrifying experience. When it lands its punches, Resident Evil 2 hits like a champ.Resident Evil 2 works best when it is taking risks and altering how players engage with it. It breathes new life into the gameplay by switching character perspectives. A segment as corporate spy Ada Wong turns Leon’s story into a sort of puzzle game, where Ada uses her spy tech to manufacture escape routes from a variety of different deadly situations. More impactfully, Claire’s story leaps perspective to the child Sherry Birkin. Her sequence is part room-escape and part horrifying hide-and-seek as she attempts to escape from the evil police chief, Brian Irons. These moments continue the trend set by Mr. X—they disempower the player and help Resident Evil 2 break away from its more standard action to something more cerebral. These sequences were present in the original game but are given more focus here, creating an ensemble feel that allows the game to explore different modes of interaction. It is one area where the remake clearly surpasses the original.Resident Evil 2 also does a far better job of incorporating puzzles into the mix than contemporaries like Resident Evil 7. Much of this is due to just how dense the police station and adjoining areas are. These locations are packed with keys to find, generators to power up, serums to concoct, and safes to unlock. Often, this is simply a matter of finding the right widget to plug into the correct sprocket but there’s just enough variety here that you’ll find yourself examining items for clues, mentally marking down where initially inaccessible items are, and sitting down to work through genuine brain teasers. None of it is particularly novel but it is masterfully woven into the larger experience and more interesting than just a set of locks and keys. The puzzles help slow the pace into something a bit more introspective. It never quite reaches the sublime mixture of navigation and brain teasing of the original Resident Evil nor its subsequent remake, but these moments help modulate a game whose shift toward traditional combat isn’t sufficient enough to carry the full experience.Resident Evil 2’s variety is commendable, but leaves the game feeling inconsistent as it never seems to settle on a theme. Its jumbled experiences don’t combine into as intelligent a whole as Resident Evil’s remake. That game took a core experience of isolation and added a gothic richness. This Resident Evil 2 remake applies modern sensibilities and experiments and the result is less coherent. That’s not to say that it is a bad experience. In fact, it’s easy to see how many of the design decisions are motivated by a desire to capture the original’s action tone. But Resident Evil 2 mixes its modes to such a degree that while each individual piece is appreciated, it is hard to say if they point towards a purposeful experience. Much of this comes from how generic the proceedings feel in comparison to other games in the franchise. Resident Evil evoked Romero horror and Gothic classics like Frankenstein, Resident Evil 7 leaned into the grindhouse world of The Devil’s Rejects and found footage films. It’s harder to define what Resident Evil 2’s identity is. It might simply be that Resident Evil 2’s identity is Resident Evil 2 itself. That’s fine, but I wish this game had a clearer ethos other than to exist for its own sake.The parts are greater than their sum, and the remake’s lack of visual identity or narrative goals becomes an issue as things progress. Resident Evil 7 leveraged its schlock-film influences to tell a story about the nature of families. It used the severing of limbs and increasing levels of mold as visual metaphors for separation anxiety and wrath. The Resident Evil remake mixed gothic images and hard-cutting camera angles to create a sort of modern day horror. It mixed high luxury with isolation, and even expanded on the series mythos with new terrors like the face-wearing Lisa Trevor. The Resident Evil 2 remake never manages to really explore its themes or build out its world. (A recently announced DLC called Ghost Survivors will feature new character perspectives and will hopefully add some extra narrative depth.) Claire’s story takes steps in that direction, but falls short of telling the Aliens-esque story of motherhood that it could. None of this prevents the remake from being fun. It’s some of the best zombie blasting you’ll find. But this is an adaptation more than it is a franchise redefining expansion.It doesn’t help that the narrative is marred by a lack of returning actors. Resident Evil’s charm as a series rests both in the original camp presentation of the originals and the growing earnestness with which later games presented its pulp-action. Resident Evil 2 suffers from a lack of two figures: voice actors Matthew Mercer and Alyson Court, who portrayed Leon and Claire previously in the series. For reasons unclear, Resident Evil 2 opts for a new cast led by non-union actors and the result is that the narrative lacks charm. It doesn’t have the campiness of the original or even the self-serious earnestness of later games. Scenes move at a rapid pace, actors plowing through lines that might have been given far more weight and richness. The decision to go with a new cast harms Resident Evil 2 as a production, both ethically and in presentation. Scenes feel rushed and line delivery is too sedate. That understated nature sometimes translates to a budget-television feel that doesn’t even achieve the comfortable camp that initially defined the franchise. Instead, the new acting feels off-brand, like a college student’s reimagining of Resident Evil 2.Resident Evil 2 provides some of the best moments in the franchise. That can mean turning to flee as an unstoppable tyrant stomps closer and closer to you, using a flamethrower to dispose of a plant-infested zombie, or puzzling out where to place the Queen piece in a puzzle. The raw experience of playing Resident Evil 2 is visceral, bloody, and often incredibly rewarding. It stands side by side with some of the series’ best entries. It’s only in retrospect, after Raccoon City is in the rearview mirror, that questions begin to form. What was the game doing? What new things were built upon a familiar foundation? Did all the changes really work?For many fans, the answer to that last question will be an unequivocal yes, but the game can also feel uneven, moreso thanks to the changes made to modernize it. The new game certainly charges ahead more, but it’s lost something. The remake forces a somewhat ill-fitting gameplay frame onto environments and atmosphere that doesn’t always accommodate it well.  It exhibits  inspiring confidence as it presses forward without fear. But it’s that last part that gives me pause: without fear. It’s a fine game, an excellent horror experience, but also an inconsistent one. It  is neither a reinvention or a completely coherent celebration. It’s something trickier, if consistently captivating. It is pulse-pounding and a must play for horror fans, sometimes experimental but also superficial and rougher than expected."
Resident Evil 2,Matthew Kim,USgamer,https://www.usgamer.net/articles/resident-evil-2-review,"I’m clutching my injured side and running for my life through Raccoon City Police Department’s west corridor. A zombie crashes through the window at the foot of the stairs ahead, and I can hear the claws of a licker clattering along the ceiling behind me, but it’s the stomps of the pursuing tyrant that have my heart pounding. Mr. X was sent here to smush my head. He’s unkillable, relentless, and he wears a narrow-brimmed hat like a deranged men’s rights activist.I make it to the safe room around the corner just in time, the door swinging shut behind me, and I turn in time to see the tyrant cheekily poke his head around the door as if he’s looking to flog me some car insurance. Soon after, I hear him stomping away.Mr. X hunts you incessantly whenever he’s around, but there are a few places where you can seek refuge. Like the xenomorph in Alien Isolation, he’s mostly unscripted and governed by set rules. This ruleset occasionally collides with other game systems to create funny, unexpected moments like the one above. You can also use his logic against him, drawing him to an area with gunfire before legging it to another wing of the station. Playing as Claire, you can get a silencer for your SMG that allows you to kneecap zombies in peace. 
 
The first few times you face him, panic takes over. The strange layout and tight corridors of the police station - a former museum - means that running without a purpose equals death. You have to constantly consult your map. Limited inventory capacity also forces you to make choices as to what key items to carry at any time, since they will be taking the space of ammo and healing items. Wherever you go, you have to go with purpose. You’re forced to pay attention.Because of this, you naturally learn the layout of this place as you play. Somehow, it only becomes more and more enjoyable as your mastery evolves. Resident Evil has always been about space. You’re in a hole and you can’t escape - you can only go deeper, into the parking garage, through the dog kennels, into the sewers, and finally, into the laboratory below. Even escaping the laboratory takes you deeper still, into the tunnels beneath the skin of the city. Along the way, you find shortcuts that loop back to earlier points and unlock new doors that increase your understanding, connecting those two locations like synapses firing in your brain. It’s intoxicating. 
 
My first playthrough takes me almost nine hours, not counting cutscenes, inventory management, and map consultation. By my fifth playthrough, I’ve cut my time down to just over two hours. I’ve made notes of all the puzzle solutions, allowing me to skip out getting the clues. I know which items to go for and which to leave. I know that avoiding the dead is often the best course of action, and I know that I should board up as many of those goddamn west corridor windows as I can.The thing is, the faster you try to play, the more mistakes you’re likely to make. It’s all fine and well running past zombies, but you’re going to have to navigate these rooms again later and with Mr. X dogging you. That aforementioned west corridor becomes a nightmare bottleneck if you don’t take the time to board up certain windows, and you have to return there at a few key points. Mess up and you’re stuck in a narrow walkway filled with lickers, zombies, and that unkillable bastard.Then there are the differences between playthroughs. Claire and Leon both have access to different areas of the station, as well as different enemy configurations. These alter slightly depending on which you play as first. One minute you might be fully stocked on ammo and ready to take on anything, and the next you’re limping along with a knife. There seems to be some kind of magic algorithm under the hood that works to keep you teetering on the edge of running out of ammo, so you often feel like you just scraped through. 
 
Even the way enemies behave keeps things exciting. Zombies move erratically, pacing past open doorways and teasing you with their rotten heads. When moving towards you, they sometimes change their gait, clawing at you in a burst of speed. The way their arms reach out to grab you can sometimes throw off your aim as well, the bullet tearing through their arm and causing the meat to fall off the bone like a slow cooked leg of lamb. Then there are the critical shots which occasionally see zombie heads explode in a single bullet, completely at random. The game is laced with things that can turn situations for and against you in a moment. That layer of unpredictability keeps things fresh through subsequent playthroughs.That gore system is also the best ever devised. Each shot takes a chunk out of an approaching zombie, and they can take a hell of a beating. What’s scarier than a normal zombie? A zombie with no fucking face, still trying to chomp at you with its exposed jaw and empty eye sockets, of course. This works together with a weighty physics system that sees downed zombies drop with a thud, or fall with their arms stuck between the bars of a jail cell. I killed one zombie in an office and it keeled over on a table. Moments later, it reanimated and began crawling along the table towards me. I shat it. Then there’s that zombie - I call him Peanut - who lost all his limbs and laid on the floor, staring and clicking his jaw in my direction. 
 
In all, I only really have one complaint, and it’s that I wish Leon and Claire would shut up. When aiming at an enemy, they have a set amount of voice lines where they react to the situation. Rather than sounding scared, they scream “fuck off” at zombies, and hurl other insults at the undead. At one point, Claire shouted “asshole” at a zombified dog. Still, it’s not enough to detract from a game this good.For my money, Resident Evil 2 Remake is right up there with Resident Evil 4 as the best game in the series. It’s the perfect blend of nostalgia and the new, marrying a classic game with contemporary game design, and a prime candidate for those Game of the Year lists. In January!

Resident Evil 2,Chris Carter,Destructoid,https://www.destructoid.com/review-resident-evil-2-2019--538881.phtml,"darkAfter the bombastic Resident Evil 6 nearly killed the franchise, we’re starting to see a resurgence of the series.While going back to the tried-and-true original with an HD remake is an almost guaranteed home run, Capcom also managed to follow up nostalgia with innovation in Resident Evil 7. The series is in a good spot is what I’m saying, and now the Resident Evil 2 remaster can join its ranks.Resident Evil 2 (PC, PS4 [reviewed], Xbox One)Developer: Capcom R&D Division 1Publisher: CapcomReleased: January 25, 2019MSRP: $59.99This isn’t just a touched-up re-release, it’s a full-on recreation of the original game. Some character models look completely beefed up (or in Mr. X’s case, morphed into a beefcake), a few sport interesting aesthetic changes, but nearly all of the alterations are for the better. Environmental touches like more dramatic lighting are standard fare, adding more urgency to some of the game’s myriad tense moments, but creepier enemy patterns are more nuanced. It’s all thanks to the decision to use the relatively recent Resident Evil 7‘s engine as a canvas.The entire setup is also ripe for revisiting. Leon, a green recruit of the Raccoon City police force, and the equally capable Claire are still quite the duo. There’s still some cheese, sure (I love seeing Leon yell “get off him” at a crazed lunatic who’s in the process of biting someone’s neck off), but it’s toned down a bit as Capcom severely pumped up the gore and horror factor, propped up by the updated sheen.The police station, much like the classic mansion in the original, also deserves a special mention as a character in and of itself. It manages to open up without getting too ridiculous (shotgunning wolves in an open tundra in Revelations was a bit much) and still present plenty of labyrinthine tunnels when it needs to. It’s creepier thanks to the engine change, and it most definitely benefits from Capcom’s decision to wait over 20 years to remaster it rather than the alternative: a stop-gap project a few generations ago.Not everything needed to be updated though. I still adore the built-in tension and overall philosophy of the Resident Evil series, which rewards prudence, thriftiness, and exploration. That latter bit is key as you’ll really need to take in your surroundings like a hawk. Did you remember that one hallway that has a door that needs bolt cutters to get through two hours after it’s relevant? I hope so, or you’ll be doing a lot of wandering, even with the semi-useful markings on the in-game map. Resident Evil has always awarded vigilance and this remaster continues that worthy legacy.While I don’t necessarily mind the fixed camera angles or tank controls of old, modern concessions that eliminate both ultimately help Resident Evil 2. Useless items are marked, so you can safely dispose of them. Multiple zombies can overpower you and knock you to the ground dynamically. The new engine is transformative: seeing a crawling zombie with no face (that you just shot off) is a spectacle.There are a few tradeoffs. Running animations are a little stiff, especially when juxtaposed to other elements of locomotion. Zombie grabs are a bit static and repetitive as well (they tend to always grab with pinpoint accuracy and hold on a little too long), even if they look visually impressive. There’s also a strangely low amount of zombie models present: to the point where you’ll see the same few faces every 10-15 minutes. You could chalk this up to the fact that they’re undying folk, but it does get a little silly witnessing the same exact dude shambling toward you after blowing another clone’s face off moments before.These are minor gripes: the world subsequently feels more alive and functionally impressive. This is mainly the same gist and location beats (which I won’t ruin here just in case, even if the game is two decades old), and the slight alterations to the story make for a better-paced, more horror-driven experience.While some may lament the removal of the “zapping” concept of the original, I don’t really miss it here. Now there are two clear cut-campaigns to tackle, which can either be played by Leon or Claire. Options are the name of the game, as you’ll unlock a “New Game [2nd Run]” with changes after the first completion (which took me roughly five and a half hours). There’s also another hardcore difficulty (ink ribbons required for saving, no autosaves, and enemies are stronger) and more extras in the form of 4th Survivor (a mini-scenario with Hunk and fixed items) and a Tofu jaunt.It’s interesting as you’re butting against the same exact linear pathway filled to the brim with enemies, but slowly learning and adapting the most optimal way to use items and dodge pratfalls (beat my time! It’s 10:39). After that, it’s onto the harder joke mode with Tofu on (basically) the same journey, just with knives-only. Between that and hardcore mode, stalwart fans of the original who are worried about the remaster being overly streamlined should be sated.My complaints about the Resident Evil 2 remaster are minimal. An argument could be made that Capcom could have done more, but the spirit of the original has been preserved and in many cases, enhanced. I hope every legacy game in the series gets this loving treatment, as I’ll probably be playing them for the rest of my life.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]SuperbA hallmark of excellence. There may be flaws, but they are negligible and won't cause massive damage.

Jason Faulkner 
I remember being nine-years-old and seeing Resident Evil 2 among the new releases at Wal-Mart. I don’t know exactly what drew me to it, as I had never played a horror game before. Something inside of me just knew I had to have it. That January day in 1998 I took a fresh copy of RE2 and the unofficial Prima guide — the one with the creepy Van Gogh looking zombie on the cover — home with me and entered the world of survival horror for the first time.Resident Evil 2 is one of my top games of all time. I played it during an especially tough time in my life. My father had just passed away, and I was emotionally raw. The game scared the bejeezus out of me. I had to hide the guide underneath a dresser because that damn zombie creeped me out so much, only pulling it out when I needed a crucial clue.But, even though RE2 gave me plenty of nightmares, it also helped me. The fear of zombies and Lickers enabled me to forget the much more immediate concern of life without my father. That’s the gift of horror games and movies. It’s a warped form of escapism that puts our real fears in perspective, and I’ll always love Resident Evil 2 for this reason.When I heard the news that there was finally going to be a Resident Evil 2 remake I was ecstatic. Over the years I’ve come to love the rest of the series, even the weaker entries, but RE2 is where it all began for me. Although I was somewhat nervous that somehow the magic of the original would be lost, reviewing this reimagining of Resident Evil 2 has been an absolute pleasure, and this game marks a real return to the series roots.The premise of RE2R is the same as the first. Leon Kennedy is the latest addition to the Raccoon City Police Department. Even after being warned by his superiors to steer clear of his first assignment, he drives into Raccoon City to see if he can make a difference. He crosses paths with Claire Redfield, college student and motorcycle enthusiast, who is looking for her brother and one of the main characters of RE1, Chris Redfield.The two wind up in Raccoon City surrounded by zombies and other horrors created as a result of the nefarious actions of the Umbrella Corporation. Along the way, Leon meets Ada Wong, a woman who claims to be an FBI agent investigating Umbrella, and Claire meets Sherry, a little girl who has somehow survived the horror, but who is more connected to its origin than anyone would guess.The path our two heroes take through the Resident Evil 2 remake is significantly different from that in the original, but the story hits many of the same points in one form or another. The most important fact for fans of the original is that nothing has been removed. All the characters you know are here, and many of their roles have expanded.But the Resident Evil 2 remake isn’t just a remaster with added content. It would be easy to get that image in your head since that’s how Capcom handled the remake of the original Resident Evil in 2002. Instead, this is a from-the-ground-up reimagining. Every single bit of the original has been changed in one way or another.There’s plenty of familiar territory in Resident Evil 2 remake, no doubt, but by necessity, no location in the game retains the exact same look as its original counterpart. Some purists might think this is a bad thing, but there was no other way to make this game. The original used pre-rendered backgrounds and fixed camera angles, so whole swaths of locations were just never in view. It’s weird to think of just how much of the RPD, Sewers, and Labs we didn’t see in the original, and how much was filled in with our imagination.Because of the limited view of the original’s fixed cameras pretty much the whole game had to be redesigned to some extent. All those places that were out of sight before now needed to have just as much attention paid to them as the ones that were out in the open due to the decision to use a third-person, freely-rotating camera. As a result, even the areas that closely follow the design of the original game feel new.The higher fidelity imagery also adds a lot of details that we never got to see in the original. A lot of areas in the original allowed you to examine them to get flavor text like, “The desk is disorganized and untidy. It probably reflects the owner’s personality.” Now, though, you get to see that type of thing instead of just reading commentary on it by the characters. The whole game is peppered with little details that make it feel more real. For example, the RPD’s walls are decked in missing person posters, departmental awards, cork boards with memos, and it just adds to the illusion of being in a besieged police station.Although many areas are similar to their counterparts from the original game, there are a massive amount of additions, tweaks, and twists that come with Resident Evil 2 remake. Some locations have been moved, items may do things they didn’t do in the original, or be used in different ways. Puzzles are also all-new, so even if you find yourself in a familiar situation, you’ll see that knowledge of the first game doesn’t always translate into knowing what to do in the remake.The remake expands each location in the original game considerably. The RPD gets a whole third level added to it, a more extensive basement, and more. The sewers are now more than just a brief stopover and are a key location in their own right. You’ll also get to see more of the streets of Raccoon City than you did in the original game. Besides familiar areas, there are also entirely new locations that have been added that you’ll visit during your journey.There are a few places that have been removed, though you probably won’t even miss them the first time through the game. I don’t want to drop spoilers and ruin anyone’s exploration experience, so I won’t name what these areas are. I will say that the geography makes more sense with one of them gone, and at least one section of another canon Resident Evil game now makes a hell of a lot more sense.The most important thing about the new environmental design is that I didn’t feel like I was missing anything from the original after I was done with Resident Evil 2 remake. The locations Resident Evil 2 takes place in are as much a part of the cast as Ada, Sherry, or Annette, and I feared that something significant would be cut or changed in a way that would negatively impact the game. Surprisingly, Capcom somehow managed to translate the game into a fully 3D world without leaving anything important out.We haven’t seen classic zombies in Resident Evil since before Resident Evil 4 debuted, so I was really wondering how they’d pull them off. In the third-person RE games, we’ve always had zombies that for one reason or another retained enough intelligence to allow them to use weapons or work as a group. I genuinely wondered if they could implement those classic, dumb zombies in 3D without making them feel toothless. After all, a big part of what made them so threatening in the original game was the fixed camera angles and tank controls.I’m glad to report that RE2R‘s zombies are even more threatening than the ones in the original. For one, they’re tougher. They can take a whole handgun magazine in the chest, and you might make them fall over, but they’ll be coming back for more.Because zombies soak up ammo, you have to be more strategic when combating them. A lone zombie in an area can be a major block to your advancement. They hit harder than in the original, but you also have more choice on how to deal with them. You can lure them out of an area and run past them. If you can’t do that, you can handicap them by blasting off one of their legs, since with this game zombies are fully dismemberable. Of course, if you’re feeling your inner Dirty Harry, you can also fell them with one melon-splitting magnum headshot.What adds even more to the feeling of horror that zombies, and other enemies, bring is the gore system in Resident Evil 2 remake. Each gunshot, explosion, or knife swipe takes out a big chunk of your enemy wherever it hits. Blast a zombie in the face with a shotgun, and you might be rewarded brain matter flying everywhere, or if you’re unlucky you might just have peeled off the meat and now have a grinning skull lunging toward your throat.One place that RE2R really improves on RE7 is the enemy variety. Besides a few minor enemies, all the monsters from the original return, albeit some in different forms. While some are just a graphical improvement over their original versions, they all have new weak spots and behaviors that take advantage of the new 3D gameplay. Lickers, for example, are blind and hunt based on hearing. This was a facet in the original, but given their improved lethality in the remake, stealthing past these long-tongued monsters is a smart tactic.I just got done talking about enemies, but there’s one in particular that stood out as an absolute menace. Tyrant T-103, a.k.a. Mr. X returns in the Resident Evil 2 remake as an even more intimidating enemy. In the original game, he’d appear during each character’s B scenario and was imposing there. However, he was also predictable. After getting over the shock of him bursting through a wall or slowly walking down the corridor at you, it wasn’t hard to realize that if you just go through a door, then he’d leave you alone until the next time you triggered him to pop out.I rarely feel any panic in games. After all, how often is there actually something actively fighting against you in games? In the majority of games the AI just reacts to you entering an area, you kill or slip past them, and that’s the end of it. In Resident Evil 2 remake Mr. X is no joke. Mr. X doesn’t care about all that passive mess. He wants to kill you, and he is going to follow you until he does it.The first time I met him, I was genuinely panicked. I knew where I had to go, but that relentless thudding as you hear him closing in on you makes it hard to think. The RPD forms many loops, so you do have a chance to evade him, but it’s easy to get pushed into a bad situation. You may have to slip into a corridor with a Licker or several zombies and try your luck with some enemies you can snake past or takedown.While he may be relentless, you can outpace Mr. X. He’s sensitive to sound, so if you avoid firing your gun, step lightly, and don’t slam through doors, it’ll take longer for him to track you. For me, this was somehow worse than him just thundering after me. Sneaking down the desolate corridors, filled with the creaking of wooden boards punctuated by the moans of the undead all the while listening to his footsteps getting closer, then further, then closer is nerve-wracking. This is survival horror, this is what Resident Evil is all about, and RE2R captures it spectacularly.The good part, though, is that Mr. X doesn’t overstay his welcome. The parts where he chases you are thrilling without becoming unfair and frustrating.The transition to 3D could have been a bad one for Resident Evil 2. The original game gives the illusion of 3D, but really all the action takes place on one plane, with some limited interaction above and below the player. The thing that made the gunplay difficult and exciting in the original was the awkward controls, obscured vision, and spongey enemies.All the controls and combat of the original RE2 had to be thrown out the window for the remake. The transition to the third-person camera makes things a lot more complicated. The perspective is now over-the-shoulder and plays more like RE4, 5, and 6 than it does RE2. However, don’t let that fool you into thinking RE2R is an action game.The devs have taken a system that could have led to a more traditional third-person shooter feel and tweaked it to retain the horror feel. The most crucial step they took was when it comes to aiming your weapon. RE2R requires a bit more time than your standard third-person shooter for your character to take aim. If you aim and immediately fire, the spread will be so wide you likely won’t hit anything, even if it’s right in front of you.Instead, each weapon has its own quirks when it comes to aiming right. If you don’t want to waste your very limited supply of bullets you need to stand your ground and take your time between each shot. As you play the game more, you’ll start to get down the nuances of each gun, and you’ll start getting the muscle memory down to fire right at the moment when your character has steadied themselves.All but one of the weapons from the original game return in RE2R, and you can find upgrade parts for each throughout the game to enhance their abilities. You may be upset to hear that one weapon was cut, but I assure you, it sucked, and no one liked it. To make up for it, the Spark Shot and Flamethrower are actually useful this time around, and I found that every weapon for both Claire and Leon had its utility.RE2R manages to introduce an entirely new method of control and gunplay while still retaining the overall feel of the original. This is an area that was really make-or-break for the spirit of the game, and I’m impressed that Capcom was able to pull it off.To complete both Leon and Claire’s scenarios the first time took me around 11 hours. I already knew the general layout of the RPD, minus the additions, from the original game and the demo, and went through at a relatively brisk pace. Contrary to early reports, however, A/B scenarios are still in the game. This time around they’re called 1st and 2nd runs, and the differences between them are a bit more negligible than in the original. However, I still found it fun to take each character through both of their scenarios.Besides the 1st and 2nd run scenarios, there’s a host of other unlockables available as well. The “Records” section gives you a checklist of tasks to complete, for which you’ll be rewarded with models for the model viewer, concept art, weapons, costumes, and even other modes. Hunk returns in a revamped 4th Survivor mode and you can still unlock Tofu in The Tofu Survivor as well.You get a rank at the end of each campaign run-through as well. So, there’s a lot of fun to be had in trying to beat your times. It’s evident that the developers kept speedrunners in mind when designing the game, and one of the things I like about the new location designs is that there are a ton of optional areas that you don’t even have to visit to beat the game.So, if you choose to take the scenic route, there’s plenty of places to visit and items to obtain that can help you in your journey. Alternatively, if you’re looking to make a record time you can skip these non-essential locations at the expense of perhaps not getting a weapon upgrade, or having to make do with less healing items or ammo.While I was reviewing the game, I managed to get an S rank, but I’m confident there are more efficient paths to take than I did. I can’t wait to see people start speedrunning this game and see just how minimalistic you can get with a run.I also got the good fortune to play with the retro soundtrack, and man, if you’re a fan of the original, it’s definitely worth a whole playthrough just to experience this DLC. I’m generally not one to emphasize any purchases beyond the base game, but the retro soundtrack is just nostalgia city, and still manages to blend well with the new gameplay and locations.The Resident Evil 2 remake has brought the series back to where it needs to be. This game captures the spirit of the original trilogy perfectly while also bringing to bear all the good things that came out of the later entries in the series. As a fan of the original RE2, I was blown away by how much love was poured into this remake, and I hope it’s a sign of things to come for the future of Resident Evil.Whether you’re a long time fan or a newcomer, Resident Evil 2 remake is an absolutely fantastic game. It’s the best in the series yet and wholly outshined my most optimistic expectations. It doesn’t supersede the original, but it’s an excellent retelling, a wonderful update, and an excellent experience.Buy Resident Evil 2 Now!Resident Evil 2 reviewed on PS4.

Login NowThis slick, action-packed remake of the survival horror classic is Capcom at its finest, but is it worth making a trip back to the zombie-ridden R.P.D.? Our review. For the most part, you should never remake a classic. It’s been gotten wrong too many times in the past to count, whether we’re talking movies, songs, video games, or other forms of media. There’s a reason why it’s a classic, after all – and messing with what made it that way in the first place is often a bad idea.However, Capcom has proven in the past with 2002’s GameCube Resident Evil remake that, under the right circumstances, the new product could possibly surpass the original. It’s not often this happens, and it’s hardly ever fair that the new version could ever replace what came before it, but it can get pretty damn close. That’s the case with Resident Evil 2, Capcom’s latest stab at revitalizing the long-running survival horror series. Instead of taking the existing game and slapping a fresh coat of paint on it for a quick buck, Capcom took its time to create something new, different, and sublime while aiming to preserve the greatness of the past.Resident Evil 2 is one of the best games the series has ever seen, and should be held in as high regard as the original PlayStation classic, in fact. Here’s why.The game has been transformed entirely from the ground up, though it still retains important narrative cues from the original. Leon S. Kennedy is on the way to his first shift as a member of the Raccoon City police force, but upon arriving at the R.P.D., he very quickly realizes that something's amiss. On the flip side, college student Claire Redfield is searching for her S.T.A.R.S operative brother Chris Redfield. Upon meeting in Raccoon City, the two attempt to team up, to combat the zombie threat, but are immediately divided, setting the stage for the dual campaign you can play through one after the other.This full-on reboot has shifted from fixed camera angles and tank controls to a polished, more fluid action game that's smooth like butter. Leon and Claire move slowly and methodically through labyrinthine, nearly claustrophobic environments, with some of the best handling the series has seen since Resident Evil 7. The action-oriented over-the-shoulder play is tweaked to perfection here, swapping in third-person shooter methodology that instills gut-wrenching horror in every step you take.The atmosphere is unbelievable, as is the tension that permeates every inch of the game. This is Resident Evil, distilled to its finest form, and you’ll want to drink every single bit of it up. It’s lush, it’s visceral, it’s morbid. It’s the culmination of what the series always has been and could be, and then some.With the darkness washing over everything and your flashlight acting as the only beacon in a world rife with bloodthirsty zombies, you feel the chill of this new vision of Resident Evil right away. Moans and blood-curdling shrieks can cut through the silence at any moment. One wrong move, and the deteriorating corpse at your feet may spring up to greet you. You can unload an entire clip in it, sure, but it may still keep coming for you.That’s why it’s such a boon that you can now blow limbs off to cleave through a zombie’s leg or ankle and slow them down, or give them a shotgun blast to the face that, for the first time in recent Resident Evil history, actually looks like you hit them at close-range with a powerful weapon. We’re not talking chunks flying everywhere, but believable model destruction that could very well give you nightmares if you’re not used to sinewy-faced shamblers reaching out for you in the dark. It’s a beautiful thing, seeing a horror franchise embrace everything that makes it terrifying in the first place, and this was one of the game’s biggest highlights for me.Yes, the zombies' gore factor this time around has been ratcheted up to 100, and the game features, quite frankly, the best blood, entrails, and disfigured corpses I've ever seen in a game, even from those that purport to be ""horrific"" and ""disturbing."" It’s fun to just sit back and pump the zombies full of lead to see what you can do to them as they’re lying there because it’s so ridiculously detailed. There are also encounters, such as with the always painful-looking William Birkin, that really drive home how much work was put into making every inch of this game look as detailed as possible. Mmm, guts.Of course, we can't forget about the Tyrant, also lovingly referred to as Mr X. The persistent boss character's threatening presence, stature, and demeanor are even creepier than the first time we made his acquaintance, and actively attempting to avoid him is nerve-wracking in the best possible way. Somehow, he's even more imposing than ever before. Perhaps it's that hat, or that slow, sure gait. He knows he can crush you like a tin can, and he wants to. Whatever it is, it's a signal to get your butt moving and get gone before you're pulverized.Thankfully, his appearances aren’t random, and he isn’t a consistent threat throughout the entire game, but when he’s out and about, you need to hightail it out of there to somewhere he’s not, unless you want to lose quite a bit of game progress. He’s always been one of the most intriguing parts of Resident Evil 2 by far, and the terror he strikes in the hearts of players is only magnified here. He adds an incredible amount of tension to the game, which makes it even more of a pleasure to play through.Most of the threats you’ll face are zombies and other variations thereof, of course. Some classic enemies are nowhere to be found, however, such as spiders and crows, which may bug series purists. In their stead are a spread of interesting new enemies that'll have you shaking, though, so it's no huge loss. It's still something to keep in mind if you're looking for those big fuzzy arachnids and wondering how nasty they look in HD.For those looking for more cerebral action, fear not – it's not been turned into a third-person shooter by any means, though you'll have your fair share of zombie slaying to deal with. There's a wide variety of puzzles to contend with, some similar in scope to the original Resident Evil 2's, and a selection of others that are completely new. You won't be able to rely on old solutions (or old guides) here, and may find yourself stumbling until you figure things out, but that's part of the fun. Being forced to figure out which key goes where and if item X needs to be used for area Y has always been an integral part of the series, and that's still here in full force.Just because you’ve finished one campaign, that doesn’t mean you’re completely finished. It doesn’t matter who you start with. Go back and do it again with the other character for your next playthrough, otherwise you’re not even done. Both Leon and Claire's campaigns feature a wealth of completely different scenarios that are integral to experiencing the whole of Resident Evil 2. While you’ll explore a modicum of the same areas and complete similar objectives, a good stretch of each campaign is totally different. For instance, there are entire blocks of time you'll spend with or as different characters, such as Ada Wong with Leon and Sherry Birkin with Claire.Ada is on her way to catch up with the enigmatic Annette Birkin during her portion of Leon’s campaign, utilizing her EMF visualizer and pistol to get past the obstacles in her way. She can hold her own, of course, but you’ll have to be smart about when and where to use the EMF tool so you can progress to the next area. Sherry is a stealth-oriented character, with no way to defend herself beyond flitting behind cabinets and desks to avoid being slaughtered by Chief Irons. You’ll only switch off to these “partner” characters with extended one-time scenarios, so it’s not a tag-team affair. Originally, you took control of both characters a few times, so the campaigns have been condensed a bit to streamline the switch-offs. While Ada’s action-packed segments are entertaining of course, it’s Sherry’s section that really caught my attention, as it takes place in an entirely new area: the orphanage. Police chief Brian Irons is after the young girl, and he’s up to no good, for reasons I can’t spoil here. He takes Sherry to the orphanage, where she’s dead set on getting out and getting back to Claire.There are a variety of disturbing sights and sounds found there, too. In one area, he has Raccoon City’s Mayor Warren’s daughter spread out on a table with the intent to stuff her, calling back to his profession as a taxidermist in the past. The scene has chilling implications as you wonder what Irons was up to before the young girl was tied to the table. Sherry has to hide from Irons in a section not unlike something you’d see in games like Outlast, where you’re being chased by an unbeatable enemy that’ll send you hurtling toward an instant Game Over if you’re spotted. It was an excellent stealth section that really communicated what a piece of work Irons was, and elevated Sherry’s character for me, personally.You’ll also come across quite a few surprises in terms of boss encounters and scenes that definitely weren’t in the original game that I won’t spoil here, but suffice it to say, you’ll be left with your jaw hanging open. Unfortunately, the game doesn’t take the opportunity to flesh out or expand on some of the more ambiguous parts of the Resident Evil lore, which I would have liked to see, but given that it does deliver with new content all its own, that’s not a huge issue.Beyond its main components, everything about Resident Evil 2 is an absolute joy. From the updated character models to the voice acting and everything in between, you can tell this was indeed a labor of love pieced together painstakingly in a way that Capcom knew would appeal to even the most hardcore fans.It's a small touch, but I appreciated the fact that both Leon and Claire would occasionally utter phrases like ""Oh, what the f*ck?"" and other incredulous exclamations while traipsing around areas positively riddled with zombies. It’s not often you hear these organic sound bytes in games, as most protagonists wade calmly through hordes of monsters and enemies, usually stopping to comment on the situation when they receive a call or something like that. Leon and Claire love to talk about what’s going on around them, unprompted, which will always get a giggle (or equally horrified line) out of you.Then there’s the extra content aside from the game. When you finish the game, you'll unlock The 4th Survivor, a brief side story featuring series mainstay Hunk. Complete this mission and you'll be rewarded with the Tofu Survivor mode, which lets you take on The 4th Survivor once more as the adorable, gelatinous blob of bean curd. There are other surprises that come out of Tofu Survivor, but you'll have to play to find out what they are.Beyond conquering both Leon and Claire's paths and improving your rank with each run-through, there's a series of fun in-game ""achievements"" you can unlock that grant concept art, character models, and other goodies. There’s a series of Weekly Challenges that are set to come to the game soon, but I couldn’t access them during my review period as they weren’t yet available. Selecting the option went to the Resident Evil website, as the option was linked to an address that obviously wasn’t live at the time. It’ll be interesting to see what these bring to the table and what sort of rewards they offer as well.For those wondering, there are no microtransactions whatsoever, nothing you have to pay extra to enjoy, and nothing you can’t unlock with a little bit of effort. Leon and Claire’s campaigns can be completed in about 7 to 10 hours total, but you can get through them both a lot quicker than that. For my S-rank playthrough of Leon’s campaign, it only took under four hours, and you can shave plenty of time off from there.Don't labor under the delusion that, if you played the original Resident Evil 2, that you should skip this one for some reason. There’s no excuse of “I’ve already played the original, so I don’t need to grab this one.” You couldn’t be more wrong if that’s your line of thinking. From top to bottom, this is already an early contender for Game of the Year 2019, and one of the greatest reasons ever to be a survival horror fan. This incarnation of Resident Evil is nearly like playing a wholly different game, and in fact stands on its own as an excellent analogue to one of the greatest survival horror games of all time. Whether you're a Resident Evil fan or you're looking to delve into the terrifying world of horror gaming, you owe it to yourself to make this iteration of Resident Evil a day one purchase.This review is based on a PlayStation 4 code provided by the game’s publisher. Resident Evil 2 will be available for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on January 25, 2019.Fueled by horror, rainbow-sugar-pixel-rushes, and video games, Brittany is a Senior Editor at Shacknews who thrives on surrealism and ultraviolence.

					Great review, Brittany. Looking forward to playing this!				
					Nicely written, can't wait till Friday!				
					Give it to me now!				
					[deleted]				
					The first 2 RE games weren't particularly long. I figured it wouldn't be like RE4. :(				
					I mentioned this in the review, but you get The 4th Survivor after completing the game and then Tofu Survivor after finishing that. Obviously you finish Leon or Claire first and get their A/B scenarios after that, but no New Game+ in a technical sense. There is a new DLC package coming at some point (I covered today on Shacknews) which appears to be adding a randomizer for free, so that's good news. There will also be weekly challenges, but we don't know what they'll entail yet.

					Yay!  A good read, I still plan on finishing the 'original remake' before getting this one				
					Great review, but does it need a spoiler warning?				
					Did you get the Deluxe copy, and did you try the original soundtrack if so?				
					I did, and I did try it out. You won't be disappointed!				
					Nice, thanks!

Two years ago, Capcom struck surprising gold with its umpteenth Resident Evil video game. 2017's Resident Evil 7 was the spark the aging series needed, particularly after RE5 and RE6 threw out the series' best ideas, and it proved that Capcom still knew how to deliver familiar chills without making things boring.The game's success put Capcom in an odd conundrum. How the heck does it follow such a quality surprise? The answer is an apparent stopgap: Resident Evil 2, a deliberate remake of the 1998 classic Playstation hit.The result is honestly everything you might want from a triple-A game launching in the slow month of January. RE2 is a modern Resident Evil game: behind-the-shoulder action, smooth controls, gorgeous visuals, masterfully staged atmosphere, ridiculous entrails, and true surprises. RE2 is also a classic Resident Evil game: cheesy dialogue, tight corridors, police-station environs, lumbering zombies, and simple puzzles that rely on item fetching and backtracking.Authenticity isn't the issue, then, but rather how much of that authenticity you can stomach two decades later. Does a popcorn-muncher of a horror film sequel sound fun, in which you accept yet another return to summer camp or the creepy suburbs in exchange for new twists on familiar scares? RE2 does the same thing for video games by marrying memorable moments, tried-and-tiring mechanics, and a return trip to the Raccoon City Police Department.The zombies are back. It's Umbrella Corporation's fault. Two easily startled young people—one rookie cop and one veteran cop's sister—are running straight into the heart of the chaos to learn more, for reasons. This curiosity gets them stuck in a monster-infested police station full of weapons, ammo, puzzles, and healing herbs.That setup should sound painfully familiar to series fans, but it's not a note-for-note retread. RE2's twists and divergences from the 1998 source material are welcome, including brand-new dialogue and voice acting, though it's worth noting that the result isn't a character-driven drama on par with RE7's creepy family. Still, the most important shift from the 1998 game comes from the police station itself. Here, Capcom either reimagines the original game's most familiar scenes or invents entirely new ones, to creepy effect.Part of that boils down to the incredible tech on display, fueled by Capcom's proprietary RE Engine. Where that engine was optimized in RE7 for comfortable, fluid visuals in a VR headset, RE2 cranks its atmospheric effects into overdrive. Realistically baked lights, dazzling water effects (whether dripping as shiny particles of rain or gushing as a flood in a creepy room), judicious use of particle-loaded clouds of smoke and fog, and stretchy, gooey effects on bullet-ravaged zombies: we're teetering on the edge of what current-gen consoles can muster, and RE2 should already enjoy a cozy spot in a year-end, ""best graphics of 2019"" list.You'll still get a helluva looker on any standard or ""pro"" console this generation, but all console versions ship without getting near 60fps. This isn't a twitchy shooter by any stretch, so you'll get by, but Capcom deserves a ton of credit for letting PC players easily tweak their way to 60fps without sacrificing the RE Engine's most atmospheric stuff.You'll be forgiven for expecting something twitchier, thanks to the game's shift in perspective. Whereas RE2 originally shipped on PS1 with pre-rendered ""cinematic"" camera angles, this year's model hangs the camera behind players' shoulders.This camera perspective was first popularized in Resident Evil 4, but that game opted for open, gray-sky environs between its cabins and underground scenes. Capcom has finally married this action-oriented perspective with the tighter, creepier corridors of the series' first era. You might expect a nightmare of unoptimized cameras, like in PS1 games that constantly rejigger the view to random behind-the-back points, but Capcom makes these worries melt away with nimble camera management. That's helped by a solid control suite, tuned for fast turns and quick, smooth aiming.As a result, RE2 never intentionally hamstrings your ability to easily look at or run through its most claustrophobic moments. This game delivers a front-row seat to some of the creepiest vistas ever in a game, and it makes players feel like they're in control of a ""cinematic"" view, instead of forcing pre-rendered angles.Yet all of that positive stuff is still draped over familiar '90s adventure tropes. RE2 leads players through a sprawling, multi-path police estate, but the gameplay is ultimately quite linear. Every sequence can be described as follows: go to the one or two open paths available at a given moment. Find a new barrier and a new ""key item."" Go back to a previously blocked zone and use that key item to open a path or get a new item. Use what you've found to go back to the last barrier you discovered. Fear for your virtual life in the process. And repeat.Conveniently, when you return in back-tracking fashion to a room you've been to before, perhaps to unlock a safe or solve a puzzle, a new door, window, or vent will usually have opened. This ensures that you will at least face the fear of encountering some new, terrible zombie scourge, even if one doesn't appear. (One probably will appear. Or three.)This backtracking is made as tedious as ever by inventory management. Players can only carry eight distinct items at a time to start, and each slot can be hogged by a single weapon, a single herb, a key item, a giant stack of ammo, etc. It doesn't take long to add a few more slots, and on ""normal"" difficulty, this excludes the ""typewriter ink"" needed to save your game. (Ink only factors in if you pick ""hard"" difficulty.)But it's still a thing to deal with, clearly intended to make players feel weak and hobbled when they're forced to leave health or ammo supplies behind. But many of the game's stretches come with an abundance of items and a lack of zombie interruptions once a wave of baddies is cleared. Thus, an average player can expect to go through a major path, pick up key items, run back to a storage locker, dump certain items, go back to their previous path, grab the rest of the items, return again to a storage locker, dump more items, shuffle inventory, and head to the next objective.Is that better than having any return to a ""cleared"" zone be artificially altered by magically generating zombies? Not necessarily. But while some of the game's backtracking cleverly forces players to deal with surprises, much of it doesn't. That is a glaring miss in a game full of mostly solid center-mass hits.Did I mention the sound design? Goodness, the sound design. A quarter of the ambient sounds are tried-and-true horror game staples—creaking floorboards, growling zombies, wild rainstorms—but the majority of the soundscape is filled with diabolically weird stuff. Ambient synthesizer tones, frequency tricks, inexplicable mechanical whirls, distorted heavy breathing: this game's audio universe is pretty close to peerless.And then there's the matter of the game gleefully owning its predictability. Take a sequence in which players must retrieve a variety of mechanical parts to open a door. One path, to a ""generator room,"" is marked on the map, and to get to it, you have to go through a ""kennel room."" As in, the home of the crazed zombie dogs you just met before finding that map. Sure enough, you have to tiptoe past a row of conveniently locked cages, full of psychotic zombie mutts.Get to the generator room, and you'll find what you need—but the act of finding it loudly unlocks a door. Amid a ringing alarm, you realize you're trapped in a dead-end, where the only way out is back through the kennel room. Whose cages have all just unlocked.Beep, beep, beep.Bark, bark, bark.Crap, crap, CRAP.The panicked run that follows, sung to the tune of ""there are way more dogs and zombies than there are bullets in my gun,"" is one of the game's many pitch-perfect moments of terror, the kind that horror buffs will drool over no matter what tedium it takes to reach them. And those fans will need to really savor RE2's highs, because they're met with a good number of been-there-done-that lows.Backtracking, fetch quests, and serviceable boss fights see Capcom leaving much of the game in the ""just good enough"" pile (and, honestly, padding each runthrough's 12-hour time estimate). RE2 is by no means a modern reinvention of the horror wheel, unlike the jaw-dropping success of RE7 or the creeping-dread experimentation of Konami's P.T.Instead, it's as good of a stopgap horror game as we're likely to see for some time. Capcom has made the welcome decision of marrying existing plot, concept, and mechanics with an abundance of polish—and not overselling the results. If that sounds good enough to you, prepare to enjoy RE2's equal mix of comfort and spine-tingling discomfort.Verdict: The modern-aesthetic upgrade more than makes up for the game's lowest lows. Horror fans should immediately buy.Listing image by CapcomJoin the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

Resident Evil 2,Kirk McKeand,VG247,https://www.vg247.com/2019/01/22/resident-evil-2-remake-review/,"I’m clutching my injured side and running for my life through Raccoon City Police Department’s west corridor. A zombie crashes through the window at the foot of the stairs ahead, and I can hear the claws of a licker clattering along the ceiling behind me, but it’s the stomps of the pursuing tyrant that have my heart pounding. Mr. X was sent here to smush my head. He’s unkillable, relentless, and he wears a narrow-brimmed hat like a deranged men’s rights activist.I make it to the safe room around the corner just in time, the door swinging shut behind me, and I turn in time to see the tyrant cheekily poke his head around the door as if he’s looking to flog me some car insurance. Soon after, I hear him stomping away.Mr. X hunts you incessantly whenever he’s around, but there are a few places where you can seek refuge. Like the xenomorph in Alien Isolation, he’s mostly unscripted and governed by set rules. This ruleset occasionally collides with other game systems to create funny, unexpected moments like the one above. You can also use his logic against him, drawing him to an area with gunfire before legging it to another wing of the station. Playing as Claire, you can get a silencer for your SMG that allows you to kneecap zombies in peace. 
 
The first few times you face him, panic takes over. The strange layout and tight corridors of the police station - a former museum - means that running without a purpose equals death. You have to constantly consult your map. Limited inventory capacity also forces you to make choices as to what key items to carry at any time, since they will be taking the space of ammo and healing items. Wherever you go, you have to go with purpose. You’re forced to pay attention.Because of this, you naturally learn the layout of this place as you play. Somehow, it only becomes more and more enjoyable as your mastery evolves. Resident Evil has always been about space. You’re in a hole and you can’t escape - you can only go deeper, into the parking garage, through the dog kennels, into the sewers, and finally, into the laboratory below. Even escaping the laboratory takes you deeper still, into the tunnels beneath the skin of the city. Along the way, you find shortcuts that loop back to earlier points and unlock new doors that increase your understanding, connecting those two locations like synapses firing in your brain. It’s intoxicating. 
 
My first playthrough takes me almost nine hours, not counting cutscenes, inventory management, and map consultation. By my fifth playthrough, I’ve cut my time down to just over two hours. I’ve made notes of all the puzzle solutions, allowing me to skip out getting the clues. I know which items to go for and which to leave. I know that avoiding the dead is often the best course of action, and I know that I should board up as many of those goddamn west corridor windows as I can.The thing is, the faster you try to play, the more mistakes you’re likely to make. It’s all fine and well running past zombies, but you’re going to have to navigate these rooms again later and with Mr. X dogging you. That aforementioned west corridor becomes a nightmare bottleneck if you don’t take the time to board up certain windows, and you have to return there at a few key points. Mess up and you’re stuck in a narrow walkway filled with lickers, zombies, and that unkillable bastard.Then there are the differences between playthroughs. Claire and Leon both have access to different areas of the station, as well as different enemy configurations. These alter slightly depending on which you play as first. One minute you might be fully stocked on ammo and ready to take on anything, and the next you’re limping along with a knife. There seems to be some kind of magic algorithm under the hood that works to keep you teetering on the edge of running out of ammo, so you often feel like you just scraped through. 
 
Even the way enemies behave keeps things exciting. Zombies move erratically, pacing past open doorways and teasing you with their rotten heads. When moving towards you, they sometimes change their gait, clawing at you in a burst of speed. The way their arms reach out to grab you can sometimes throw off your aim as well, the bullet tearing through their arm and causing the meat to fall off the bone like a slow cooked leg of lamb. Then there are the critical shots which occasionally see zombie heads explode in a single bullet, completely at random. The game is laced with things that can turn situations for and against you in a moment. That layer of unpredictability keeps things fresh through subsequent playthroughs.That gore system is also the best ever devised. Each shot takes a chunk out of an approaching zombie, and they can take a hell of a beating. What’s scarier than a normal zombie? A zombie with no fucking face, still trying to chomp at you with its exposed jaw and empty eye sockets, of course. This works together with a weighty physics system that sees downed zombies drop with a thud, or fall with their arms stuck between the bars of a jail cell. I killed one zombie in an office and it keeled over on a table. Moments later, it reanimated and began crawling along the table towards me. I shat it. Then there’s that zombie - I call him Peanut - who lost all his limbs and laid on the floor, staring and clicking his jaw in my direction. 
 
In all, I only really have one complaint, and it’s that I wish Leon and Claire would shut up. When aiming at an enemy, they have a set amount of voice lines where they react to the situation. Rather than sounding scared, they scream “fuck off” at zombies, and hurl other insults at the undead. At one point, Claire shouted “asshole” at a zombified dog. Still, it’s not enough to detract from a game this good.For my money, Resident Evil 2 Remake is right up there with Resident Evil 4 as the best game in the series. It’s the perfect blend of nostalgia and the new, marrying a classic game with contemporary game design, and a prime candidate for those Game of the Year lists. In January!

Resident Evil 2,Gary Bailey,God is a Geek,https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/resident-evil-2-review/,"25th January 2019I’m not going to beat about the bush on this one: Resident Evil 2 is a triumph. Whether you are a fan of the original or not, this remake is phenomenal. Right from the beginning, it sinks its teeth into you like the zombies contained within, and it refuses to let go.You play as either Leon Kennedy (thankfully, he’s dropped the middle “S” initial when he introduces himself) or Claire Redfield, who are both drawn to Raccoon City on the same day. Claire is looking for her brother, Chris, while Leon is heading to his first day as a police officer in the RPD, and quite possibly the worst first day ever. You see, Raccoon City is in a bit of a pickle on the day that our heroes arrive. A virus has ravaged the population and turned them into the walking dead, leading Claire and Leon to head to the police station in an attempt to find safety.Probably not their best decision, as it turns out.The great thing about the original game is that it was still a fantastic entry point to the series, requiring no prior knowledge of the story. This means that newcomers to Resident Evil will be right at home in the remake too, and as with the Gamecube remake of the first game, Capcom’s complete reimagining of its classic sequel means that this is essentially a brand new experience for both new players and fans of the PlayStation original. Make no mistake, fans will not be disappointed. The game may have been rebuilt from the ground up, but there is still a familiarity in its design that had me grinning on numerous occasions throughout. From direct reproductions of certain rooms and corridors, to the little musical nods littered throughout the game, it feels like Resident Evil 2.The game sets its stall out early on, as you’re forced into a dark corridor with nothing but a torch and your near-empty handgun. The darkness feels like it’s pulling you in, your torch illuminating nothing but ruin and decay, as you search for survivors and clues as to what happened in Raccoon City. Fairly soon, you’ll find yourself surrounded by the undead and struggling to survive, which is a feeling you’d better get used to. They shuffle and lurch toward you, their flesh rotting and their teeth gnashing, and they don’t drop easily. Headshots do the most damage, but shoot their arms and legs and the sinews start to stretch, as limbs tear free from their owners. It’s disgustingly impressive and, as I said, these zombies don’t drop easily.But it’s not just the undead you have to worry about in Resident Evil 2. I’m not just talking about the Lickers, terrifying in their shiny new RE Engine incarnation; there is another danger that stalks the hallways of the RPD building: the Tyrant. Originally, this trenchcoat-wearing hulk would not appear until the second scenario that took place alongside the main story. He was seemingly unstoppable in his pursuit of Leon or Claire, but would only show up at set times. However, in this new version, not only does he stalk you during the main story, he sticks around. I swear, whenever I hear the clomping of boots from now on, it will trigger horrific memories of hiding from the Tyrant. I literally said, “nope,” when he first appeared, as I turned on my heel and fled in fear.The Tyrant is actually a fantastic example of how well sound is used in Resident Evil 2. When played with headphones (or a big ol’ surround sound system), you’ll hear his heavy boots stomping around whenever he’s nearby. Music rarely plays, leaving the ambient sound to do most of the heavy lifting, which makes his proximity all the more alarming. There was a moment during my Leon playthrough where I was in a small room with only one way in or out, when I heard those boots stomping around and I froze. I backed Leon into the corner, hoping that the Tyrant would give up and try elsewhere, the muffled boot steps not allowing me to get a precise fix on his location. Then the door burst open and I found those lifeless eyes locked on me, the music kicked in and all hell broke loose. Instinct drove me to pull my shotgun’s trigger, the impact hitting the Tyrant square in the face and staggering him just enough that I could make my escape. He followed and I fled in terror, I dodging zombies, only for him to toss them aside like ragdolls. This sums up most of my time in the Raccoon City police station.However, it must be said that after a while the Tyrant’s pursuit can become tiring. You might find yourself having to do a lap around the station to avoid him when he just happens to be wandering around outside the room you need to enter. Don’t get me wrong, it’s never less than incredibly tense even then, but there will probably be times when you just want to go use that key you just found. It is possible to lose him for a while, but when things go silent that can be even worse, as he can pop up when you least expect it.Capcom has nailed the atmosphere, with some astonishing visuals to match the quality of its sound design. Even the opening shot of the game, a close-up of a greasy burger followed by the truck driver’s messy eating of said burger, just feels like the developer is showing off. There is a level of detail in this enhanced version of the RE Engine, the same one used for Resident Evil 7, that shines whether you play in 1080p or 4K resolution. I did try it in both, but it’s an impressive feat that the PS4 Pro has it running at 60fps in 4K with nary a dropped frame. The level of detail in the characters is in a different league to RE7, which is impressive in itself, and Leon, Claire and Ada look especially real at times. Every time there’s a close-up shot of either main character, the animation is jaw-dropping.The gameplay is where it really shines, though. Gone are the fixed camera angles, instead replaced with the claustrophobic over-the-shoulder view of Resident Evils 4-6, which allows you to really get close to the horror. I spent most of my first playthrough carefully walking around (when I wasn’t being chased), checking corners and shining my torch into every nook and cranny, pausing at every zombie groan heard in the distance. I had to watch my ammo, choosing whether to take out a zombie or bypass them entirely. Inventory management is key in Resident Evil 2, as you strike that balance between carrying the right ammo and health items, while leaving yourself room to pick up new items and keys. When things get more heated, like when a boss is trying to put its giant claws through your face, the controls still feel tight and responsive. The only reason you’ll miss a shot is because you’re panicking at that rapidly approaching claw.But like the Resident Evils of old, this remake focuses as much on exploration as it does on its action and scares. You’ll spend a good few hours looking around the police station, backtracking when you find the key to that locked door you passed an hour ago, but the game never lets you do it in peace. Something is always waiting for you, or tracking you. Even if you think you cleared that corridor earlier, chances are something new has crawled out of the woodwork. At one point, I returned to an area to find that several new zombies had appeared because I hadn’t boarded up some windows. That caught me out completely. Puzzles make a welcome return on top of all this, in both familiar and new forms. Some are as straightforward as finding a key item, whereas others offer nothing but a riddle or an image, leaving you scratching your head for a while. It feels good when you find the answer and it all adds up to an experience as rewarding as it is terrifying.Resident Evil 2 is a remake that feels incredibly faithful to the original, paying homage through subtle music cues that recall classic pieces from the 1998 soundtrack, as well as telling the same story for a more modern audience. Not to sell it short however, as it’s far more than a simple remake: It constantly throws new things at you during the 12-15 hours of that first full playthrough. It feels like a whole new game that anyone can enjoy, as long as they don’t mind changing their underwear after each gameplay session. This is not just Resident Evil for a new generation.This is Resident Evil at its absolute best.Dripping with atmosphere
Stunning visuals
Incredibly faithful, but still feels fresh and new

Resident Evil 2,Kyle Hanson,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/resident-evil-2-remake-review/,"The Resident Evil series is mostly broken up into two distinct eras. There’s the survival-horror classics, and the action-fests that followed RE4. Lately, such as with 2017’s Resident Evil 7, Capcom has worked to merge the older style with more modern gameplay sensibilities. Nobody wants to run around using tank controls and fixed cameras anymore. So with Resident Evil 2, the team had a lot of work ahead of them. And with the specter of one of the best remakes of all time in the Gamecube REmake hanging over its head, the pressure was truly on. Clearly that pressure wasn’t a factor as RE2 lives up not only to the original, but to the series’ pedigree as one of the best franchises in horror gaming.This new remake of Resident Evil 2 follows the same overall plot as the 1998 classic. Players start off by choosing between RE2’s two main characters. Each has their own semi-unique story. Leon is arriving on his first day as a rookie cop, while Claire is searching for her missing brother: Chris Redfield of Resident Evil 1 fame. While these characters technically have their own story, much of the content is recycled between the two. You’ll even be solving a lot of the same puzzles, and searching for the same items.It’s a bit of a narrative disconnect, and the second time through the horrors of Raccoon City aren’t as impactful as the first, but it helps flesh out the game and its story. If you finish one chapter and not the other, you will be missing out, though it would have been nice if more had been put into separating these two characters’ stories and especially the puzzles. The original release was pretty similar, with this remake just merging together elements from what used to be four much more alike campaigns. So it’s not a loss, but it is still worth noting that these aren’t two totally separate campaigns. More like two different flavors of the same one.Like its predecessor, this is one of the best remakes of all time, hands down.Playing as either Leon S. Kennedy or Claire Redfield, you must survive the nightmarish, zombie-infested town of Raccoon City. You’ll explore the Raccoon Police Department, searching for puzzle pieces and helpful items/weapons; all while being chased, tormented, and attacked by the various mutated creatures that hide within. As the danger grows, and you meet fellow survivors, you’ll start to figure out just what went wrong here. What wiped out all of Raccoon City and turned its populace into flesh-eating monsters? If you live long enough, you might find out.Resident Evil 2 impressed back in 1998 with its gory, tense, and truly scary adventure through a ruined city. However, its tank controls, fixed-cameras, and other antiquated elements clearly needed an upgrade on their way to a 2019 release. Capcom could have taken a light touch, editing around a few things while updating the graphics and securing a decent, if underwhelming release. That’s not how Capcom does things though, as evidenced by the original Resident Evil remake on Gamecube.Still considered one of the best remakes of all time, that game showed the power of a caring team being given free-reign to update and rework a true classic. They’ve done it again with Resident Evil 2 Remake. This game is simply phenomenal in all the ways it needs to be. You’ll be saying “wow” and finding yourself in disbelief all throughout RE2 Remake, as you see how gorgeous it is, but also how well it plays.Let’s get the easy stuff out of the way first: Resident Evil 2 looks fantastic. The RE Engine has been impressing for years, with RE7 offering stellar visuals and atmosphere two years ago. It’s clearly been updated over those intervening years, because the RE2 remake is gorgeous. Characters, textures, lighting, all of it is at or near the top of its league, and being layered on top of what was already a well-crafted game just makes it all that much better.Resident Evil 2 is seen by many as the pinnacle of early RE games. Featuring a rewarding and interesting story, the game still held true horror within the dimly lit halls of RPD and areas beyond. Of course, with the RE series moving more toward action in its later entries, and the proliferation of zombies across all media, the scares were either going to be absent in the remake or at least be tough to pull off.This is especially true as the RE2 remake shifts to a more traditional third-person camera angle, giving players more control over what they see and do. Thankfully, the team behind this game have found truly brilliant ways to ratchet up the scares. From its first few moments, Resident Evil 2 will make players feel tense, scared, and all those other adrenaline-pumping emotions they crave from survival-horror games. How it pulls this off is through some really inventive positioning of enemies, and the general dread created by the sound design, and the fact that enemies could be ready to pounce on you around every corner.Does the game cheat a bit to create this atmosphere? Yep. Zombies take a ton of bullets to truly bring them down. Sure, a couple of headshots, each of which tears away parts of the zombie’s rotted flesh in gory, realistic, and impressive fashion, will bring them to the floor, but that doesn’t mean they’re dead. If you really want to make sure they go down and don’t come back up, it can take entire clips of ammo, or more. This can create less fear and more frustration at times, as you (and your character) exclaim how ridiculous it is, but it works exceptionally well overall.The only areas where it feels like Resident Evil 2 truly falters are when it loses its pacing.Adding to this are various boss or mutated creatures that truly strike fear into the hearts of players. Never before has walking into a room and hearing the sound of a Licker been more terrifying as it is in Resident Evil 2’s remake. The Tyrant has also been improved, and has shifted from an intermittent story point to an ever-present nightmare. Whenever he’s around, you know it, and there’s not much you can do but run and hide. Hearing Tyrant stomp around brought back memories of Alien: Isolation, in all the right ways.In fact, sound plays a massive role throughout all of Resident Evil 2. The Tyrant can strike fear with just his thumping foot steps, but every creature has their own unique way to make players soil themselves. The lowly zombie, which often becomes fodder for bullets to the brain, can make sounds you’ll remember in your worst nightmares. It all comes to life through some fantastic audio tech, which starts with Dolby Atmos support and expands with binaural audio that puts you right into the game. Playing Resident Evil 2 late at night, in the dark, with your surround sound speakers/headphones turned way up will make you feel like a scared child again…which is exactly what it should do.So Resident Evil 2 nailed all the things it had to to live up to the original, but does it stand on its own? Will someone like this game if they never played the 1998 original? If you like survival-horror, then absolutely. In fact, if this were a brand new game, it’d still be deserving of this high praise I’m lavishing onto it. RE2 has a great story, with interesting characters, in an intriguing universe, and it offers fun, challenging gameplay that is capped off with some truly frightening atmosphere.The only areas where it feels like Resident Evil 2 truly falters are when it loses its pacing. The RPD area is great, and feels like you’re always exploring someplace new, or working through the maze-like hallways in an orderly fashion. There’s backtracking, but it all works well. The second area you explore hurts the pacing immensely with its meandering structure and dull design. It doesn’t kill the player’s enjoyment of the game, but it feels like a slog, and the extra  story elements this remake add don’t help a ton. Things get back on track, and RE2 doesn’t overstay its welcome like so many other horror titles, but if editing was an option, there were some areas where a larger, sharper knife could have been applied.From top to bottom, Resident Evil 2 is a stellar achievement from a team that obviously loved the source material and went to great lengths to update and enhance it without losing that original magic. Its few faults either lie in the original source material, or are added elements that don’t truly detract from the game’s worth. Like its predecessor, this is one of the best remakes of all time, hands down.

Resident Evil 2,Jeff Grubb,GamesBeat,https://venturebeat.com/2019/01/22/resident-evil-2-review/,"Connect with top gaming leaders in Los Angeles at GamesBeat Summit 2023 this May 22-23. Register here.I have enough stress in my life. I’m a parent to a young kid. We’ve got another one arriving any minute now. The future seems uncertain, and every moment feels like things are only getting more out of control. So I don’t go looking for more stress. And that would be a problem for a tense horror game, but somehow Capcom’s Resident Evil 2 remake is getting by just fine.Resident Evil 2 is the latest entry in the long-running survival-horror franchise. It is due out January 25 on PC (reviewed), PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, and it is a complete reimagining of the original 1998 PlayStation release.Capcom retained the setting, characters, and basic story of the original, but the publisher also incorporated elements from other games in the series. Resident Evil 2 uses the same RE Engine that powered the atmospheric and beautiful Resident Evil 7. And like Resident Evil 4, this remake uses an over-the-shoulder camera perspective to put you closer to the action.The result is a Resident Evil that is scary but also packed with excitement.GamesBeat Summit 2023Join the GamesBeat community in Los Angeles this May 22-23. You’ll hear from the brightest minds within the gaming industry to share their updates on the latest developments.Resident Evil 2 introduces a hacking tool to solve puzzles about halfway through. At the same time, it strips many of your weapons away from you and handcuffs your ammunition. This makes you vulnerable, and in this part of the game, a massive enemy makes regular attacks against you.With almost no ammo, I began putting three bullets into the thighs of every zombie. This strategy causes their leg to fall off, which slows them to a literal crawl. That gave me enough time to solve the puzzle in the room and move along.That’s when two things happened: I found a locked door. And the large boss-style enemy showed up right behind me.I only had 9 rounds. So I aimed down sights and waited for my reticle to shrink to ensure accuracy. It was a tense moment, trying to line up the shot with the over-the-shoulder perspective and the enemy barreling straight at me. But when I had everything just right, I unleashed 9 rounds right into the behemoth’s face.Above: Resident Evil 2 is extremely beautiful at times, and it is always moody and atmospheric.Somehow, I had just enough bullets to stagger the giant. It didn’t kill him, but it stopped his progress. That gave me just enough time to remember I had a door to unlock. I pulled out my hacking tool and got through just as the monster was getting back to his feet.This encounter is indicative of everything that Resident Evil 2 is great at. It’s horrifying. I was scared. But the solution wasn’t just to run away or hide. I had to fight back just long enough to create an opportunity to escape.Capcom struck an ideal balance between horror and action, and that is why this remake works so well. Yes, it is stressful. I would almost call it too stressful for a fragile guy like me. But the fights give you just enough space to punch back that you feel like you can create some breathing room.Resident Evil 4 is still my favorite in the series. I prefer action over horror. But where Resident Evil 4 has a lot of variety in its action, Resident Evil 2 remake keeps things fresh on multiple different levels. And it is better than any other in the series at serving all of Resident Evil’s disparate audiences.If you’re here for the lore and characters, Resident Evil 2 nails it. Are you looking for a zombie game with modern graphical tech, Capcom’s got you. If you want something that is intense and full of action, this is a bingo.Above: Leon Kennedy is not Rick Grimes.But Resident Evil 2 also plays all of its various aspects off of one another really well. It has bigger and badder enemies to break up the monotony of the slow-moving zombies. And to break up that combat, it has the charming old-school puzzle design where you open secret passages with a medallion. It is a smart game for modern players who are looking for multifaceted gaming experiences.Aiming and firing your weapon in Resident Evil 2 feels nice. But moving your character around the world is still a bit awkward. It is a huge improvement over the tank controls from the early games, but I still find myself struggling to get my character to move exactly where I want. And that’s a problem when it results in a zombie getting close enough to give me a nip on the neck.I also found myself opening up my map every five steps at a number of points in the game. The dark police station is tough to navigate. And just as you get the hang of things, it opens up a new area. And when something giant and impervious chases you, you don’t want to go down a dead end or anything.Resident Evil 2 isn’t as scary as I was expecting. It is stressful, but it’s not the nonstop nightmare fuel that Resident Evil 7 was.It is still stressful, but most of that comes from a sort of situational horror. Almost any game would cause you stress if you had to make it from one side of the map to the other with a wounded character, no health items, and 2 rounds in your weakest hand gun.Above: A metaphor … probably for the president or something.The zombies, the lickers, and the rest of Resident Evil 2’s cast of undead just don’t frighten me much anymore. I’m probably just desensitized at this point, but I was expecting Capcom to do more.Resident Evil 2 is going to click with a lot of people, and those folks are going to love it. I still really enjoy it even if it didn’t fully click with me. But my issues with this game are just a matter of taste and not execution. I prefer the Resident Evil 4 style where I have enough ammo to just blast my way out of every situation.But what’s great about Resident Evil 2 is that it’s still a really fun and well-made experience even when it drives someone like me out of their comfort zone. That’s the sign of a strong game.Finally, Capcom has put a lot of game into Resident Evil 2. It has four remixed campaigns — two each for the playable characters Leon and Claire. But Capcom has also revealed plans to add even more. That includes a mode that randomizes where items are as well as new player characters.It’s a good time to be a Resident Evil fan again.Score: 85/100Resident Evil 2 hits PC, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4 on January 25.

Leon and Claire’s pulse-pounding adventure through Raccoon City’s zombie-infested streets, police department, sewers and hidden laboratories stands as a staunch and undeniable classic in the medium of interactive entertainment.Sign up to receive the daily top stories from the Financial Post, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.A welcome email is on its way.

Please try again The problem with games, though, is that they don’t age very well. Unlike movies, music and books, revisiting a game released 20 or more years ago is often a painful experience, as our modern gaming sensibilities are forced to contend with antiquated technology.Case in point: Resident Evil 2‘s presentation, while outstanding for its era – I actually remember telling my friends at the time that it was so lifelike that I felt like I was playing a film – is now laughably outdated. More than that, it has clunky controls, terrible aiming, annoying loading screens between every room, a frustratingly restrictive camera … the list goes on.The none-too-easy task assigned Capcom’s remake team was to keep everything that players loved about the original while cutting or improving everything else. They had to give us the game we remember through rose-coloured glasses, not the one we actually played.And, by golly, that’s exactly what they’ve done.2019’s Resident Evil 2 captures the vibe of the original perfectly, thanks largely to outstanding production values.Its visual design stands toe-to-toe with any contemporary work, with fantastic character models, dramatic motion capture performances and extraordinarily detailed and refined environment design. Just about everything is worth looking at a second or third time, either to catch a potential game clue or simply to appreciate its beauty.The audio is just as impressive, featuring a talented cast, wonderfully creepy ambient sounds that help make you feel like water is pattering on tile in your living room or fire is burning in the next room, and a minimalistic but powerful score that always rears its terrifying head at just the right time to send one’s pulse racing and make you wish you hadn’t switched off the lights.It’s the tweaks to how the game plays, however, that show just what a careful and loving a hand was applied to remaking this beloved work of interactive art.The restrictive camera is gone, replaced by an over-the-shoulder perspective that feels natural by modern standards but still allows for the sort of tight direction and jump scares inherent to the Resident Evil experience. And Capcom’s gamesmiths have managed to keep the original’s stop, pivot and aim shooting mechanics – something I’ve always felt was far more realistic than the running and gunning found in most games – while adjusting movement and targeting so that it feels natural and unrestricted. I felt empowered to track and aim at both lumbering and fast-moving enemies.And by eliminating virtually all loading screens – including moving through doors and walking up stairs and ladders – movement through the game’s iconic police station and other environments is far quicker and more exciting. What’s more, this speedier traversal makes the limited inventory – essential to creating a sense that you aren’t a superhero, that you’re vulnerable, that you must both plan ahead and be extremely cautious – more bearable, since getting back to a stash to switch out items no longer feels like such a slog.Perhaps most satisfying of all is the trick that Capcom’s designers have pulled off in making exploration both familiar and new. Having played the original Resident Evil 2 more times than I can remember, I went into the remake feeling as though I already knew all the locations I’d be visiting. And while much of what I expected was there, and where I thought it would be, locations have been expanded and slightly rearranged. Enemies don’t always show up where you remember them, keys aren’t where you might think, and puzzles are fresh and challenging.Add in a host of subtle but important quality-of-life improvements – maps provide much more information, including locations of items you’ve had to leave behind and types of locks and barriers you’ve encountered; and sorting through inventory and combining items has been simplified and made more intuitive – and you’ve got the great game that we remember made completely playable in the modern age.Of course, whether it will have the same appeal to a younger audience unacquainted with the play style of early Resident Evil games is an open question. I can’t clearly separate how much of my enjoyment of Resident Evil 2 can be attributed to smart, timeless game design and how much to the powerful nostalgia I felt from start to finish.Truth be told, though, at the moment I don’t much care. I’m still sailing high on the joy of re-experiencing one of my very favourite games in a new yet vigorously familiar way. I can’t wait to jump in for a second play-through.

Resident Evil 2,Matt Cox,"Rock, Paper, Shotgun",https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/01/22/resident-evil-2-review/,"Undying affectionCertain moments in Resident Evil 2 are imbued with a specific kind of awful. Moments when calculated slaughter gets drowned under a tide of undead flesh, all thought of eradication consumed by escape. There's this deep, prolonged pull of fear, punctured by sharp desperation. Moments when a dozen zombies and worse lumber between you and presumed safety, grabbing and biting and clawing as they drag you to the floor over and over again. It's messy. It's grim. It's kind of brilliant.It does strange things to your head, reviewing a remake of a survival horror game you know to be beloved. My first impulse was rejection.I know what you lot are like, you see. You lot, with your blood-tinted spectacles and habit of holding up outdated classics as modern masterpieces. ""Doom is still the best shooter of all time"", you'll say, forgetting that the aiming is weird and it doesn't have any grappling hooks. My first couple of hours with Resident Evil 2 reminded me of that, even though it's in proper third-person now and you no longer control a human tank from nightmarish corner angles.Horror games need to horrify, and those first hours did not. Nothing quells fear like familiarity, and nothing is more familiar than a zombie. I know exactly what those chaps get up to. Ripping people in half, moaning, reanimating, lumbering - check check check check. My eyes glazed over as b-movie action was interspersed with b-movie cutscenes, my schlock tolerance not cut out for a hammy mix of over and under-acting.I ran down gloomy hallways, I got lost, I felt little but frustration. Raccoon City's police station was like a Gothic painting by numbers, only some of the numbers were stupid puzzles. 
 
There was one near the start that particularly jarred, with its naked insistence that I tap in a correct button sequence by trial and error. They're puzzles of the sort that provide little satisfaction for those that solve them quickly, and far too much anguish for those that don't. Another source of anguish was the limited inventory, which I refuse to regard as a worthwhile constraint. Lack of inventory space doesn’t generate interesting decisions. It generates tedious jogs back to the last magic box.I thought I was trapped in a game that was itself ensnared by the past. Then I met a licker.Nothing should be allowed to scuttle like a licker. Even if they were to just stick to the floor, which of course lickers do not. They're on the walls. They're on the ceiling. They're on your chest, gouging out chunks of precious torso. I hate them. They've got brains where they shouldn't, claws longer than your leg, tongues that... well, let's just not talk about the tongues. 
 
The point is, I thought Resident Evil's capacity to scare had been lost in a cloud of contrivances, perhaps blown in by the winds of time, perhaps there from the beginning. That licker was the first fella to prove me wrong. It wasn't the last.Where lickers taught me panic, the tyrant taught me dread. A slab of bulletproof marble, marching towards you with all the inevitability of death. You can run, you can hide, but you can never escape entirely. You'll still hear the pitter patter of oversized feet, clunking forwards to a beat that makes you want to puke at every dead end. You'll reach that central area, the one you'd assumed was an oasis of safety where nothing could follow. You'll be wrong.As the Evil grew Eviler, I grew paradoxically more comfortable. Not with the horrors inside the world, but with the task of navigating it: I stopped my thoughtless wandering, and shifted to targeted exploration. I made a proper study of the map, putting more work than I'm used to into learning my way around. I still struggled - and that's with the help of a map that changes colour when you've found every item in an area. A modern convenience, indispensable for a generation accustomed to arrow-following. 
 
I still got stuck, and I'm still not convinced that was always my fault. I spent 40 minutes trekking around one section, not realising the key to progress was literally on my person. Or it would have been, if I hadn't stuffed a crucial object into storage because of that needlessly small inventory. You heard me. NEEDLESS.Which brings us back to the story. It's poorly written, poorly acted schlock without a milligram of believability - though I'm conflicted about whether to hold that against it. I've come to see it as goofy set-dressing that often undercuts the menace, while - sometimes - contributing to the fun. It's hard not to laugh at a parent who seems comically uninterested in the safety of her child, or a cop who's worried about not having the authority to work with an FBI agent in the midst of a zombie apocalypse. 
 
That cop's called Leon, and he's the player character for one of two campaigns. They're disappointingly similar, taking you on near-identical tours of sewers, police stations and laboratories. Apart from the cutscenes, the main difference between them is a section where you play as one of the people you meet. I found the special section in Claire's campaign, she being the other protagonist and (one of) Leon's lazily insinuated love interests, far more effective. Playing as a child in a horror game might be a cheap trick, but it works.I do wish they'd stop screaming “you bastard” at the poor zombies. Especially you, Leon. Even though you do have the more satisfying weapon selection, with one gun in particular that pops heads oh-so pleasingly. Regular enemies go down in three or five headshots to a regular pistol, which is a neat way of wresting away control. It makes it hard to calculate the time or bullets needed to deal with an approaching mob, leading to the kind of panic I described earlier. Unless you break out Leon's lovely lighthawk. Then you get to enjoy an animation where you kill a zombie just as it lunges, shrugging off its freshly headless-corpse. 
 
That's where Resident Evil succeeds. Not in the drivel spouted from its character's mouths, but in the bullets spewed from their guns. Or better yet - the clicking of empty chambers, or the spine-chilling scratches of scrabbling overhead. I may hate lickers, but I'm also a little bit in love.You're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!

Resident Evil 2,Pierce Turner,GamingTrend,http://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/re-masterpiece-resident-evil-2-review/,"There’s an art to remaking a classic. The trick is to stay true to the original, without simply rehashing the same thing; to update with new ideas, without straying too far from what made it great in the first place. This is an art that developer Capcom proved it had back in 2002 when it remade the original Resident Evil and it’s proved it once again with Resident Evil 2. This new REmake is a near perfect reimagining of the 1998 original. It’s scarier, it’s more difficult, and it rivals the best games in the series, including RE4. It’s that good.Just don’t mess up Leon’s hair.Resident Evil 2 looks incredible. The RE Engine introduced in RE7 is put to much greater use this time. The police station is beautifully recreated from the ground up, and is absolutely grand in scale. Environments are familiar, but updated to be more modern, and usually covered in more blood. Some later areas are almost completely unrecognizable like the sewers and the lab. The lighting creates claustrophobia when you can only see a few feet in front of you, characters look and act real, and the terrifying monsters are on full display, with every gory detail.Resident Evil 2 opts out of the fixed camera of the past, or newer first-person perspective implemented in Resident Evil 7, but instead uses the over the shoulder angle founded by the indomitable Resident Evil 4. You can see exactly what you’re doing, what you’re shooting at, what’s in front of you, and there’s plenty of scary things in front of you.Boss fights are intimate and terrifying.And it is scary. I got visibly spooked multiple times throughout my playthrough, but thankfully nobody was around to see. That’s saying a lot too, because I thought I’ve seen it all with this franchise, especially since this is a remake, but Capcom clearly still has some tricks up its sleeves.Like the first REmake, Resident Evil 2 plays with your expectations. Certain events play out differently than you remember, whether it’s a different place, or a different time. Remember that Licker in the window? It’s not there anymore, at least not that window. Remember that encounter with the giant alligator? Well, it plays out a little differently this time. Just about every enemy behaves completely different from the original, and they all come with their own sets of rules. Zombies are tough and will almost always keep getting up unless their head is completely smushed, but that’s hard to do, so best to stun them and keep running. Zombie dogs chase you faster than you can run, but moving in a serpentine pattern seems to work. Lickers are almost indestructible, but also blind. Stay quiet and don’t be an idiot like me and try to fight them.My mistake.The biggest change, however, is the Tyrant, and all of those other rules are thrown out of the window when he appears. This large, blueish man follows you almost everywhere, rather than only appearing in triggered events, and seeing him is about as startling as seeing a real man in a fedora and trench coat chasing you. His presence is announced by booming footsteps and music. When you hear that, it means drop whatever you are doing and run because this guy will literally push over any zombie or monster to get to you and turn you into a Leon or Claire sandwich. It’s a constant danger that makes you feel unsafe for nearly the whole game.RE2 constantly forces tough decisions on you. “Do I use this flash grenade to stun this group of zombies, or save it for later in case I get grabbed?” “Should I take the hallway full of Zombies, or go around and risk alerting the Lickers?” “What if the Tyrant shows up? I better not take the narrow hallways because I won’t be able to run past him.”M’lady.Though it’s best to run from most enemies, there are several bosses you have to take down and, more often than not, I ended those fights with my last bullet, or my last healing item. All of these fights are epic, but take place in tight, intimate arenas, ensuring that there’s nowhere to run. All of this adds to the main purpose of the game and the purpose that started the franchise: to scare the hell out of you by making you struggle to survive. Items and resources aren’t just limited, it feels like they’re actively avoiding you. It doesn’t help that the enemies are so dangerous that you are forced down to your last bullet and your last herb constantly. It may sound like I’m complaining, but this is a good thing. A beautiful thing. This is the kind of dread in horror games that crazy people, like me, crave; the kind that put Resident Evil on the map in the first place, and brought it back in recent history. Resident Evil 2 is a survival horror masterpiece, and sets an unbelievably high standard for video game remakes. The unrivaled realism, terror, and difficulty creates a tremendous, immersive experience that, honestly, makes other horror games look bad. I can see this game living on forever in speedruns, let’s plays, and even discussions for the greatest horror games ever made.—Pierce TurnerSee below for our list of partners and affiliates:One of the longest running independent gaming news, reviews and culture sites on the web.The thing that is magical about the Wizarding World isn’t the magic – it’s...by Ron BurkeThe world is going to end.

Resident Evil 2,Tom Hoggins,Telegraph,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/reviews/resident-evil-2-remake-review-survival-horror-perfection/,"Labelling this new version of Capcom’s survival-horror classic a ‘remake’ somehow feels like an curious understatement. Resident Evil 2 is a thrilling return to the legacy of the 1998 original, no doubt, hewing close to its style, structure and the zombified tale of a city infected with a devastating virus.But while it would be tempting to file this away as an unnecessary, even cynical, return to source; Resident Evil 2 is crafted with such gusto that it is as much a modern marvel as it is a nostalgia-fuelled horror tripIn its two-pronged campaign, you play as either rookie police officer Leon S Kennedy; finding his first-day in the Racoon City Police Department filled with grubby face-chewers, or Claire Redfield; a student searching for her special task force brother Chris. Bumping into each other at a zombie-filled gas stop, the pair make their way to the city’s police station before being separated; left to negotiate the former museum’s ornate hallways, locked doors and intricate baroque puzzles alone.What a creation the station is; a stage so convincingly set that you can almost smell the blood spattered in its darkened hallways. It will conjure a sense of familiarity to Resident Evil stalwarts, but has been crafted with such texture and modern mod-cons that it will feel thrillingly new to even the most experienced of players.It is thick with atmosphere and detail. The cavernous, brightly-lit main hall has been appropriated as a makeshift first-aid station. But, of course, all the beds are empty, the undead’s moans echoing towards the rafters, chairs and desks piled in front of the main doors. Venture into its bowels and the lights are out, your flashlight bouncing off walls covered in crimson Rorschach tests. The dead are everywhere, slumped in corners or over desks, while the undead smash against vending machines. Rain thunders against all-too-vulnerable windows, with rotten arms lurching out as you pass.It is resplendent with horror that creates a constant sense of unease; that something truly terrible has happened here. And that’s before you even start to consider the myriad monsters that lurk in its shadows.Much of Resident Evil 2’s milieu is created with the benefit of modern technology, of course, with the RE engine flexing its muscle in lighting and detail and binaural audio creating a genuinely spine-chilling soundscape of shuffling footsteps and inhuman shrieks. But key to it is that somewhat lost art of crafting a small, detailed and believably joined-up setting.You will be spending the majority of your time with Resident Evil 2 in the station and its appendages and as you backtrack through its halls --unlocking ornate trick boxes with gemstones liberated from statues and activating secret underground passages with medallions-- you will start to get familiar with its quirks.In an age of sprawling open-worlds, it is a genuine pleasure to acquaint yourself with a far more intimate environment. You will go from constantly checking the map, planning your next move and scrubbing off explored rooms, to knowing each creaky floorboard, blocked route and shortcut to a save point. A key skill, particularly during the times that certain indestructible git known as the Tyrant comes stomping through the hallways behind you.At its heart, Resident Evil 2 remains a certain vintage of video game, which may prove a sticking point for some. Constantly juggling inventory between armament, first aid and essential gadgets and items; battling your way to a locked door you haven’t found the key to yet...They are the kind of quirks specific to early day Resident Evil that perhaps not everyone will be on board with. But they are also essential to its particular brand of tension. As scary as Resident Evil 2 can be, there is little that compares to the horror of staggering your way through an army of the undead in critical condition, only to find you left the gear you needed in a storage trunk because you were low on shotgun shells.There is a constant sense of jeopardy, in other words. While there are modern concessions --an easier ‘assist’ mode for beginners, unlimited saves and the odd checkpoint on normal-- Resident Evil 2 still plays to the ‘hardcore’ crowd with the option of the old-school ink ribbon system which limits your saves to physical items found in the game.But while retaining some of that old ethos is key to Resident Evil 2’s success, it is equally adept at bringing itself up to date. The combat is brilliantly refined, with that Resident Evil 4 style viewpoint allowing you to pick shots with a deliciously crunchy payoff. Headshots connect with real viscera, with location-specific damage seeing flesh slewed off. Which only makes the zombies that shamble towards you regardless all the more horrifying.Even those ‘basic’ zombies are terrifying, too, with a level of detail and individuality that make them the most convincing undead I’ve seen in a video game. Each missed shot adds a layer of panic and they are all a genuine threat, particularly if they are in a pack. More than a few times in my two playthroughs have I been concentrating on a tougher enemy and been blind-sided by a lurking zombie ready to chew my neck off.That refinement doesn’t mean that Resident Evil 2 has been made into a Resi 4 style action game by any means, ammunition is limited and combat is often best avoided, but it does mean that gunplay is another string in the remake’s bow.What it allows for is a terrific sense of pacing. The heart of the game is exploring that station, but Capcom are clever at dispatching new threats just when you might be letting your guard down. The infamous blind, skin-deprived Lickers are ferocious, scuttling over walls and ready to gobble you up in a few hits. You can endeavour to sneak past them without making a sound, but it is a risky, ludicrously stressful strategy to employ, particularly if there are other enemies shuffling in the background. Or the Tyrant comes thundering into view.It’s when all these foes come down on you at once that Resident Evil 2 is at its most exquisitely terrifying; an unparalleled sense of panic as you try to wrest control of the situation without dumping all your ammo or just sprinting for the nearest door. (though, for the record, you can now be followed, zombies more than happy to bash down obstacles in their way).It is terrifically paced between that heightened stress and more atmospheric exploration, while the game also times its more obvious breakaways well. Boss fights are often claustrophobic set-tos against grotesque monsters, given an edge by that combat, while both Leon and Claire’s campaigns have interludes in which you take control of enigmatic FBI agent Ada Wong or the young Sherry Birkin respectively. These are probably not the best sections of the game, but their mixture of environmental puzzling and an altogether different kind of horror are smartly timed palate cleansers.They also help tie the wider narrative together. The writing and acting is sharper than the the original, of course, but finds plenty of space to ham it up when necessary. While there is a touch more depth to its characters than in the original, Resident Evil is B-movie schlock at its finest. “Chew on that you overgrown son of a b---h,” growls Leon as he explodes the top half of a giant alligator in a grungy sewer underneath the police station.I’m not sure you would want it any other way. The silliness helps tie together Resident Evil 2’s combination of genuine terror with baroque puzzles and excessive action, making sure that it is frightening but always fun. It has always been the ethos that has made Resident Evil such an enduring survival-horror success for over twenty years. This remake captures it perfectly, but makes sure it has plenty of fresh tricks up its sleeve to ensure it has as much of an impact on the here and now.What are your hopes and fears for Resident Evil 2 and what features do you hope the sequel retains from the original?

Here’s how it works.As I type this intro, I am seconds away from having completed Resident Evil 2. As someone who played the original game through dozens of times as a youngster in the late 90s, I find myself in a state of child-like elation all over again.What a game, I thought to myself over 20 years ago, and I'm happy to report Resident Evil 2 has the same bone-chilling magic it did back in 1998.Resident Evil 2 (RE2), more so than Resident Evil 1, is probably responsible for popularizing the ""survival horror"" video game genre, where tense exploration, puzzle solving, and limited supplies make up the basis of play. Resident Evil 2 takes very little away from the PlayStation 1 classic while adding a lot more, with completely rebuilt visuals, writing, sound, and voice acting. RE2 pays close attention to the locations and creatures RE2 veterans will be familiar with, while throwing a range of surprises into the mix. As a fan, there's very little to complain about with the finished product.Welcome to our review of Resident Evil 2, which is not just one of the best horror games on Xbox One, but one of the best games period.Warning: This review contains violent images from within the game.Back from the deadCapcom shows the world how remasters are made.Resident Evil 2 defends the franchise position as an apex horror predator with masterful suspense, infectious gameplay, and utterly grotesque creatures.Resident Evil 2 has jaw-dropping art direction across the board, which pays homage to its source material while elevating it with some modern flair.Following on from the work Capcom did with Resident Evil 7, there is a huge emphasis on truly visceral 3-dimensional gore rather than simple projected textures, giving all of Resident Evil 2's weapons a fun, impactful feel. Guns blow holes through zombie's clothes, even out through the other side, leaving chunks of fatty tissue strewn all over the place. It's quite the visual feast.Beyond the wide range of unique human zombie models, Resident Evil 2 is also well-known for its monstrous menagerie of mutant freaks and overgrown animals. The legendary ""Licker"" enemies look truly horrific in 2019. Spread inside out by their mutations, blood-flushed muscles glistening in the game's dynamic lighting.Resident Evil 7's ""RE Engine"" continues to deliver truly uncanny facial animations, twisting up in fear and pain, which compliment the boosted performance work. Leon, Claire, and the supporting cast also take on all sorts of visual wear and tear as the game progresses, starting with shiny new clothes, and ending the game covered in blood, armed to the teeth.Resident Evil 2 felt surprisingly light on music compared to its predecessor, insteadgoing for a perpetual air of foreboding ambiance. The game enlists binaural audio to extend the sense of paranoia, offering the sounds of shuffling of zombies (or god knows what else) over in the next room or hallway. This surround treatment is particularly effective when being stalked by the hulking Tyrant super soldier, whose distant thundering boot stomps are straight up panic-inducing.It's not all peachy though, at least not on Xbox One where we did the majority of our testing. There are some odd graphical glitches present throughout the game, which speak to limitations on the console to some degree. On Xbox One, Capcom seems to have attempted some form of pseudo ray tracing-style reflections on surfaces such as marble floors and in water, but in practice, it looks incredibly pixelated and glitchy. This sorta stuff was probably best left to the PC version.In addition, some textures here and there look a little incomplete or overly compressed, which betrays how detailed and atmospheric the vast majority of the game looks. Resident Evil 2 runs at 60 FPS on Xbox One X, but it does seem as though image quality was sacrificed to get it there.While an NVIDIA RTX ray tracing-capable PC will be the best way to experience Resident Evil 2, the Xbox One version is still a visceral and detailed gallery of gore that will chill your senses.Resident Evil had a bit of an identity crisis for a while, struggling to strike a balance between the ""modern"" shooter and the intentionally-awkward, punishing gameplay that the horror classic previously revolved around. In the original, save points were limited, turning was difficult, and ammo was scarce, which is generally at odds with the demands of a mass-market game.Capcom is not only rediscovering this classic horror format, it's also celebrating it.Resident Evil 2 now lets you choose between a more classic ""hardcore"" mode, complete with consumable ink ribbons to save your game, versus ""normal"" and ""easy"" modes, that feature quicksave points, and even regenerating health on the easiest difficulty. The approach should ensure fans of all types are well-catered for.While normal mode felt a little too easy (finishing the game with piles of un-used first aid sprays and ammo), hardcore mode presents a real challenge, where avoiding conflict often tends to be the better strategy. Resident Evil 2 gives you a range of tools to help out for this type of play, allowing you to board up windows in the police station, as well as use throw-away items like flash-bang grenades and combat knives to stun enemies. Even on normal mode, actually putting a zombie down permanently is quite hard. You never know if that twitching corpse in the hallway is going to leap at your ankles for a cheeky gnaw.Never trust a corpse...Beyond your standard zombies, there are far more difficult beasties to deal with. Lickers crawl on walls and can kill you very rapidly, especially on hardcore, but they are also completely blind. Painstakingly eluding them, walking as slowly as possible is anxiety-inducing, as they curiously edge towards your soft footsteps.The maps recreated for Resident Evil 2 almost perfectly match their static-background counterparts from the late 90s, with truly impressive attention to detail. That said, don't expect to be able to utilize your knowledge of the previous game too much. The path through the game's locations, whether it's the zombie-infested police station or the fetid sewers, are by and large completely different, with new keys, puzzles, and other surprises along the way.Explore the map, scrounge for ammo, solve the puzzles, find the keys.All of the classic weaponry from the original Resident Evil 2 makes a return, complete with upgrade kits to scrape and search for. Some weapons and upgrades are entirely optional, depending on how willing you are to puzzle solve or backtrack to that hallway you left teeming with zombies, while others present themselves as part of the story. A non-upgraded weapon might take longer to zero-in when aiming, resulting in missed shots, and then wasted ammunition. I am guilty of wasting entire clips in panic mode while struggling with a licker in a cramped hallway. Picking your shots carefully is crucial to managing your inventory, which is also limited in space.Resident Evil 2's movement is modernized from its predecessor. You're able to quickly turn in the direction you push your joystick, ditching the ""tank"" style controls of yesteryear.Still, Leon and Claire move relatively slowly compared to some shooters out there, which makes positioning intentionally more thoughtful. It's quite easy to get overwhelmed, especially when some of Resident Evil 2's more complex enemies come into play later in the game.Considering Resident Evil 2 barely tweaks the core concepts, yet remains incredibly tense fun proves that Capcom delivered a timeless horror formula back in 1998. Capcom is not only rediscovering this classic horror format, but it's celebrating it too.Like the Resident Evil 1 remake, Resident Evil 2 follows all the plot points of the original, while refreshing and fleshing out other aspects. The result is, surprisingly, a more emotional story, with plenty of new memorable moments, while remaining true and faithful to the iconic plot points fans will be looking forward to.Resident Evil 2 follows on from the events of Resident Evil 1 (also remastered on Xbox One (opens in new tab), also awesome), this time taking place in the fictional town of Raccoon City. Playable as both rookie cop Leon Kennedy and unlucky visitor Claire Redfield, Resident Evil 2 features a city-wide biological catastrophe, where a viral outbreak has created swarms of reanimated corpses and other twisted, violent creatures.You will play through as both Leon and Claire experiencing different paths through the story, meeting different characters, uncovering different aspects of the wider mystery.Without giving away too much for those who haven't played, Resident Evil 2 is more of a personal tale than some of the other games in the series, focusing entirely on Leon and Claire and the other survivors they meet. Resident Evil 2 remains a bit self-referential with its writing, unable to resist cheesy one-liners that spawned some of the franchise's most popular memes. That said, some of the new scenes it introduces have been truly moving, which is typically not something I expect of Resident Evil.Some of the monsters and characters have been given expanded roles and significance in the story, which adds clarity to some of the fuzzier plot points of the original. However, there does feel like some missed opportunities to add more depth. For example, Leon and Claire still don't seem even the slightest bit concerned about the possibility of getting infected, despite being bitten constantly, and despite the fact that there are corpses with hazmat suits lying around all over the place. Neither of them seem too phased by what's going on either, which is a little at odds with the attempts to inject more emotion into the plot.Resident Evil 2 won't win any Oscars, and there are certainly some missed opportunity to have further expanded the scope of the story, more similarly to how the Resident Evil 1 remake fared. However, there are shades of fresh ambition in among the returning iconic scenes that give me renewed hope for the franchise.Resident Evil 7 was not a fluke. Capcom is clearly willing and able to commit to a modernized Resident Evil formula that retains what made the series so popular in the first place, while making it appealing to modern standards. The visuals are goretastic, the sound work is nail-bitingly paranoia-inducing, and the gunplay is oh so satisfying.I had high expectations for Resident Evil 2, and Capcom delivered.Resident Evil 2 retains some of that b-movie-style writing cheese, but the attempts Capcom made to inject more emotion into proceedings while fleshing out other aspects of the story undoubtedly pushed the game beyond the original. It all leaves me hungry to see what other classics like Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, Code Veronica, and Resident Evil 4 might look like reimagined by this team.A single Resident Evil 2 playthrough consists of running through the story as both Leon and Claire, meeting different characters and exploring intersecting areas. Running through Scenario ""A"" and ""B"" will net you around 10-12 hours of play, depending on how much exploration you do, while completionists looking to unlock the hidden scenarios and additional weapons on hardcore difficulty will find they can get even more out of the game. Resident Evil 2 is designed for speed running as well, similarly to the original, grading players at the end based on how fast they were able to run through it. The Xbox version also features a lot of fun, relatively lenient achievements.As far as recommendations are concerned, I think ""Normal"" is far too easy for veterans of the series, or even fans of horror in general. You'll end up with piles of ammo and health items at the end, even if you gun down the majority of enemies you see. The auto save feature that occurs before some of the game's more difficult moments drains the tension out a bit, too. So if you're brave enough, stick it on hardcore for a more definitive Resident Evil 2 experience.I had high expectations for Resident Evil 2, and Capcom delivered. This is the best horror game on Xbox One today, and one of its best single-player experiences in general.Resident Evil 2 is set to go on sale on January 25th, 2019, for Xbox One, PC, and PS4 for $59.99.See at Amazon (opens in new tab)This review was conducted on Xbox One X with a copy provided by Capcom.Jez Corden a Managing Editor at Windows Central, focusing primarily on all things Xbox and gaming.

Resident Evil 2,Keith Stuart,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/jan/22/resident-evil-2-review-genre-defining-horror-loaded-with-dread,"Capcom’s survival horror classic returns with improved visuals, new controls and a whole host of monstrous surprisesLet’s get this out of the way: Resident Evil 2 is the best game in Capcom’s long-running survival horror series and possibly the greatest example of the genre ever produced. Released in 1998, two years after the agenda-setting Resident Evil, it introduced the iconic characters Leon Kennedy, Claire Redfield and Ada Wong. It had wonderfully horrible monsters (the tongue-lashing Lickers, the hideously mutated William Birkin, the indomitable Mr X), and it boasted a brilliant set-piece location, the Racoon City police department, housed within a scary old art gallery.Now, 20 years later, Capcom has taken the game by the scruff of its neck, fully updated the visuals and controls, and reshuffled the narrative structure to deliver a contemporary horror experience that plays like our blood-tinted memories of the original. There’s been a zombifying outbreak in Raccoon City and two characters, rookie cop Leon and student Claire, find themselves trapped in the seemingly abandoned police station, trying to work out what has happened while fighting off the greedy and persistent undead. As we encounter reams of mutated scientists and endless documents about synthetic viruses, it becomes clear that local employer Umbrella Corp has been a very naughty pharmaceutical megacorp.Every location in the game is, in fact, a giant and enthralling escape room, in which fiendish puzzles involving weird gems and gadgets and complex sequences of numbers and rotations reveal keys to the next locked area. The ultimate brainteaser, however, is inventory management. Ammo is strictly rationed, so every encounter is fraught with deadly peril (although a new assisted mode makes things more palatable for newcomers, offering unlimited saves and easier aiming).This time round the experiences of lead characters Leon and Claire have been divided into two different adventures, rather than having players swapping between two similar versions of the same narrative, which was perhaps the only trying element of the 1998 version. To facilitate this, there are new areas to discover, while iconic locations – such as the police station – have been restructured and expanded, a fascinating and at times terrifying change for veterans who still recall the original and think they know where the monsters are. Play through the game as one character, and you open up a “second run” version of the other character’s story, so the two feel much more integrated.Cleverly, the concessions to modernity – including a dynamic camera and behind-the-shoulder perspective – don’t ruin the gripping tension. Resident Evil 2 is a game loaded with dread. Every darkened corridor, dimly lit by flickering strip lights, every gothic chamber, dressed with stuffed animals and ancient libraries, every metallic laboratory, crammed with bizarre scientific equipment, is drenched in uncanny atmosphere. The diabolical mad-scientist narrative retains its B-movie schlock appeal, but is much improved with new voice acting (much to the chagrin of some fans) and lead characters who don’t look like blocky shop-window mannequins.Directed by Hideki Kamiya (who would go on to oversee the spectacularly stylish Devil May Cry, Viewtiful Joe and Bayonetta), the original Resi 2 was more lush and cinematic than its predecessor, with well-directed cutscenes that really shine in this modernised version. Drawing on influences from the Alien and Die Hard movies as well as countless gothic thriller tropes, Resident Evil 2 still feels really alive as a horror text, and its underlying themes of scientific hubris, ingenuity and comradeship will resonate just as much with younger audiences more familiar with Netflix than exploitation flicks.Ultimately, the Resident Evil 2 remake is a reminder of how beautifully crafted survival horror games were in their heyday. From a terrifying orphanage to the festering sewers beneath the city, the feel of the action is always perfectly matched with the aesthetics of the setting. The rhythm, gradually building from many minutes of quiet exploration and puzzle-solving to gigantic, pulverising boss battles, is exact and beautiful, like some monstrous Wagner opera.For veterans who remember the original (and I reviewed it at the time), it is an unmissable nostalgic treat. For those who don’t know their T-Viruses from their Code Veronicas, the experience is easily vivid and entertaining enough to stand on its own merits. This is horror game design as true craft."
Resident Evil 2,Liam Croft,Push Square,http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/resident-evil-2,"GuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpResident Evil 22022 9.0Game RatingUser Ratings: 96Our Review: Scroll DownMr. X gon' give it to yaVersion Reviewed: EuropeanMore than three years later, Resident Evil 2 remains the blueprint for any developer looking to remake a classic title. Successfully modernising the 1998 survival horror game for fans and newcomers, there's no doubting its sustained quality. What we said in our Resident Evil 2 PS4 review rings true to this day, so our new verdict will focus purely on what's new in the recently released PS5 version.The most substantial of which are two graphical modes: one implements ray tracing and the other boosts the frame rate beyond 60fps. You can't have the best of both worlds, and that's the most disappointing thing about the new native PS5 version: each graphical mode has its drawbacks to the point where there's no definitive option.Resident Evil 2 was a fantastic-looking title on Sony’s last-gen console and throwing a native 4K resolution and ray tracing on top truly makes the game shine. The main hall of the Raccoon Police Department is staggeringly shiny, with reflections popping off all over the place. In a similar vein, the dark hallways shooting off the famous entrance plaza are still dripping with atmosphere, heightened on PS5 with crystal clear graphics.The trade-off, though, is the frame rate. Having ray tracing active means the frame rate never remains consistent, constantly dipping and somewhat ruining the immersion. It's not too much of a problem whilst simply walking around the environment and exploring, but the more action-heavy the screen gets, the more the frame rate drops.If you've no interest in ray tracing, then the other graphical mode is the one for you. Seemingly targeting 120fps (don’t quote us on that, we're not Digital Foundry), gameplay is so much smoother and crisp. Again, however, you must sacrifice something. The visuals take a battering should you wish to double the frame rate, and that goes beyond the general lack of ray tracing. Lighting takes a real hit and so too do the details making up character models and objects in the environment.Thus, a situation has been created where the game is always having to compromise on one thing in order to enhance something else. Ray tracing makes Resident Evil 2 look better than ever, but it won't be a smooth experience as the frame rate routinely dips. You could instead opt to almost double that frame rate, but then the visuals aren't so hot. It's frustrating not knowing which one's best overall, creating circumstances where you know certain aspects would be better on the other side of the coin.At least it's fairly plain sailing elsewhere. Lightning-fast load times will have you playing the game in a matter of seconds. After downloading our PS4 saves (and automatically unlocking all the Trophies), we were able to zip about all our save states across different playthroughs as Leon and Claire. It never took more than maybe three seconds from hitting the load button to the title being ready to play once again.The PS5's adaptive triggers are also taken for a light spin; each weapon simulates resistance on the left trigger slightly differently. It's a very basic implementation, but welcome nonetheless. Haptic feedback is also listed as a supported feature on PS5, although we couldn't feel its utilisation outside of the standard rumble and vibration features.Taken as a whole, this PS5 version offers some basic upgrades over the original PS4 edition — it's just a shame there's no definitive graphical mode to recommend. The game is still more than worth playing in 2022; its survival horror spark hasn't worn off in the slightest. Fans will love returning to the Raccoon Police Department with an extra layer of shine, and newcomers have the chance to experience one of gaming's greatest remakes. A cheap and cheerful upgrade doesn't ruin any of Resident Evil 2's quality.Capcom hasn't gone to any great lengths with its updated PS5 version of Resident Evil 2, offering fans and newcomers two imperfect graphical modes to choose from. Very speedy load times will have you immersed in a flash, though, and the support for the PS5's adaptive triggers adds another extra wrinkle on top. Resident Evil 2 is still every bit as good as it was three years ago; this PS5 version simply gives you the chance to experience it all over again with further shine.Great 8/10Scoring PolicyAbout Liam CroftLiam grew up with a PlayStation controller in his hands and a love for Metal Gear Solid. Nowadays, he can be found playing the latest and greatest PS5 games as well as supporting Derby County. That last detail is his downfall.Comments (72)Feel like all 3 upgrades were pretty unnecessary but a really nice gesture by Capcom. The updates are not massive or game changing by any means. But they are very welcome.Shame they didn't use the haptics.Would love to feel Mr.X's footsteps coming closer lol! tbh that would genuinely heighten the experience.@rawzekuI agree also as it a free upgrade it quite decent!I said from the start that these upgrades where completely unneeded all 3 of these game looks absolutely stunning and run at a consistent 60 and apparently the upgrades have big drawbacks. Ah well they're free so F it 😅I guess the real question this doesn't truly answer is... Are the graphics at least just as good as the PS4 Pro version when playing at 60 FPS? If so, I can live with that as long as the graphics don't end up being worse.Yeah, it is disappointing that these at least don't use haptic feedback more to heighten the immersion. Oh well I guess.""You could instead opt to almost double that frame rate, but then the visuals aren't so hot. It's frustrating not knowing which one's best overall, creating circumstances where you know certain aspects would be better on the other side of the coin.""This has been one of my biggest bugbears this past generation — when a game gives you the choice for only one or the other, surely it should be up to the devs to find a balance that accommodates both framerate and fidelity? That'd be like making a pizza for someone and saying ""yeah you can have cheese, OR tomato — you can't have both"".@LiamCroft Quick clarification. Are there two NEW graphical modes or do these two replace the old ones? Seems weird that they would have just a locked 60fps mode, or do they?The best part is that it's a free upgrade. If only more publishers would do the same when it's purely a graphical change.For me personally this is worse than the original version. The only benefits are faster loading times and a slightly higher resolution. Ray tracing hurts the framerate too much but also those damn triggers. It’s now painful to keep trying to shoot compared to before. I hate that feature in PS5 games, I really do.@Andee This is why I don’t care too much for the new standard of having graphic options. I got heat for it as ‘options are good’…but we’re also seeing more and more it results in the standard of optimisation dropping.Playing at a (seemingly) locked 60fps without RT is my preferred option. Game still looks better than on PS4/Pro. 👍Resi 7 holds up better with its RT. Lovely and smooth with some beautiful (well, as beautiful as the grotesque can be) lighting. And all with nary a blip or stutter.Terrific games.@themightyant The two new ones are the standard on PS5, but you can turn both ray tracing and the high frame rate mode off. I believe that puts the game in a default 60fps state, with just a better resolution over the PS4 Pro version.From what I've seen on YouTube, ray tracing mode with VRR (supported these remasters) may be the way to go.@LiamCroft Thanks. Makes sense.@LiamCroft Good to know. I was waiting for the PS5 upgrade for (hopefully) better visuals on RE2, but it seems like if I don't want to sacrifice performance and don't have a 120hz TV, I should just play this PS5 version with the new options turned off. That's fine.Haven’t tried this one yet but they seem to go further with Resident Evil 7. On my TV, an LG CX, the 60 FPS is very consistent and the ray tracing really makes a difference. And while 120 is nice, a smooth 60 is still great for these types of games. So you’re still playing at a high frame rate and getting the bells and whistles.Did you test the high frame rate using a VRR display? I reckon that mode would be nice on my LG CX that supports it.Also IIRC the knife damage is connected to framerate, so does high framerate make the knife the boss it is on the PC ver?Played through a few hours of this last night and it's still a superb game.Your review is a little deceptive by not at least acknowledging that both options can be turned off. It does make it sound like the only options are RT or High Framerate and nothing else.Turning off both at least provides a higher resolution at a smooth 60fps. I am sure Digital Foundry would be able to provide a more detailed look at any non-RT-related benefits beyond resolution (if at all).I played only a small amount of RE2 after the update (on Series X using a previous save) and there wasn't much RT benefit in the sewer section of the game (but it ran relatively smooth). Sounds like those opening moments are the most RT heavy given all the reflections in the police station (and the rain).@LiamCroft did you get the chance to check out whether the ps5 vrr boost made a difference with the frame dips you were seeing in rt mode?@AndyKazama I have an LG CX also, and it was incredibly smooth. Mind-blowing that they still haven't fixed those aweful screen space reflections yet.. after all these years. Still pixelated afI was going to grab these games for the ps5 (even though im terrified of anything horror related) but its sad to hear about the lack of any punchy haptics. As stated above Mr X's stompig footsteps could have been fed through the controller to give an idea of location and distance. Also more distinct fire arm resistance would have been cool. Would still like to run it through my C1 vith vrr as i stopped playing when Mr x came for me and i ***** my pants 😂💩@awp69 regarding Gaming Tech on YouTube the framerate is not consistent in the RT mode but with VRR it should be ok unless it dips below 48 Fps.@R1spam important to say: There is no „boost“ with VRR. Framerate is not magically increased with VRR. That’s very important to understand. What VRR does is that it matches the framerate with the refresh rate of the display constantly, so framerate dips aren’t noticeable or at least way less noticeable than without VRR.I imagine the RT performance could get patched; Sony may even demand it if there's a lot of bad press written about it.@Andee This is standard for PC gaming and honestly i'm glad we get the choice as some people like the flashy visuals while others prefer the 60fps or higher framerate. If i had my way we would have way more settings and modes to pick from, being able you tailor the game around what you want is great.@liamCroft
You totally left out the option of ""ray tracing off"" and ""higher frame rate off"".
That according to my tv gives you 4k 60.
Higher frame rate mode drops the game to 1080p and agreed Ray tracing is very unstable.It's not a bad upgrade as it was never broke, on pro anyway.Stupid question, but ...If I buy the PS4 version (it's in Tesco for 12 quid), and play on my PS5, will I get the PS5 upgrades?@WallyWest Yeah, but this is one of the reasons I'm not a PC gamer — Pro models aside, consoles should give you a consistent performance standard that means you don't need to balance a load of spec plates in order to comfortably run the game, without worrying that you're sacrificing one aspect of the experience for another.@LiamCroft my man. Cracking TV.@Reeneman I was using the framerate display on my LG CX and didn’t see any dips while I was playing but maybe it dips during bosses or cinematics. Do have VRR for those cases though so I will stick with 60 FPS with RT on RE7 at least. It looks great!Is there no way devs could implement ray tracing when its apparent in certain locations, and then turn it off when its not visible,guardians of the galaxy for example doesnt need it in certain areas ,no idea if this is possible ,probably cause the game to fluctuate too much,ill shut up now ha ha@tinCAT-zero Absolutely! 4k60 IS the definitive way to play. I'll wait on a ps5pro to really play games with RT that aren't Sony 60fps balance modes.@CyberWolf yes mate. There isnt any native ps5 version. Just a free upgrade for owners of a ps4 copy.@CyberWolf Yes.@CyberWolf Yes. When you put the disc in there will be an option to download the PS5 version. You will still have to have the disc in to play though.This is good have grand kids will get to play these at there best for the first time ! Some things are not only about us in life !@KayOL77 I'd love a PS5 pro and PS5 slim in the future. Hopefully they'll both happen.@Reeneman apologies, I know it doesn't boost the framerate but as you say, makes dips in frames above 40ish fps harder to see. Was interested to see whether it made a difference in this unsupported game. I switched this mode on for elden ring (also unsupported) for my LG b9 and in some areas, it made a real difference to observable dips and frame pacing.Thanks for the honest re-review, I expected as much from a free upgrade!@awp69 sounds great! Unjust saw gameplay from the Gaming Tech YouTube channel. He showed RE 3 and in the RT mode there were dips below 60 but it seemed that the game at least stays above 48 fps which is then totally fine!Enjoy playing these great games!
I had always my issues with RE but I might give it a try in the future. At least moving and aiming at the same time should be a huge upgrade for me compared to the old versions.Suprised no one is talking about the upgraded 3d audio in the ps5 version,its really immersive !!why didn’t they just provide a locked 60 mode with 4K and no Ray Tracing. Seriously what were they thinking.@LiamCroft This is super helpful, thanks for clarifyingI've gone through the Hunk scenario and Claires game on Hardcore with RT and the worst performing area is the main hall and the East office, it should be noted that the lighting also benefits and it fixes the weird SSR artefacts the game had. With RT off it still looks significantly better than the PS4 version but as @LiamCroft says the Dualsense is underutilised, I did play a bit of RE7 and it's heavily used there@bighal you can turn off RT and do exactly that.@LiamCroft did you realise that you can simply turn RT off and have a locked 4K60FPS?PS5 with RT on 
PS5 with RT off 
So yeah the lighting is also improved and the PS4 original looks quite a bit worse seen below @KilloWertz they're much better than the PS4 Pro version@WaveBoy Tbh I didn't play/test the game that much. My tv will handle 120fps and for the bit I played I didn't notice any problems, either with the frame rate or picture quality at 1080p in higher frame rate mode. In ray tracing on mode I could see stutter. The other 2 modes looked brilliant and seemed buttery smooth to me. I didn't notice the picture taking a hit in higher frame rate mode, but I barely played it.I play on a Sony X95H 65"" TV.@themightyant there are 3, you can have 4K60FPS with RT on or off, so off basically locked the framerate as far as I can tell and then there's the high framerate mode. Even without RT it looks significantly better than the PS4 versionI haven't put much time into the PS5 version of RE2 (already have the Platinum trophy) as I have been with the Series X version, but to me the Series X version runs smoother with ray tracing & VRR enabled. I kinda prefer the 120fps mode though, which still looks great visually on my LG C1 OLED. I'm a big fan of the adaptive triggers on the Dualsense, so that's always a welcome addition. But Idk why Capcom (or most developers for that matter) refuse to add gyro support for PS4/PS5 games. 60 or 120fps with gyro aiming would be amazing! I love using gyro for shooters on my Switch. (Doom, Sniper Elite, Zombie Army, ect)Most Playstation games don't include it, which makes no sense.What an awesome service!Own all 3 & all FOC!!@WaveBoy much higher resolution for a start, screen space reflections have been improved with less of the halo effect and around characters and objects even wothout RT. The Pro version was image reconstruction for that resolution and this looks significantly sharper, it seems to have higher settings for volumetric lights and a few other things from what I can tell. I did post some screenshots above. The resolution is certainly the biggest difference overall without RT and with it looks better again with improved lighting too@SCHONBOB You do realize there's an option to turn it off in the ps5 settings... right?@get2sammyb probably my favourite game on the PS4, I spent much of yesterday on it and it's still amazing@WaveBoy The 120fps mode is meant to be good. Also, I'm refusing to play 120fps modes until it becomes an actual norm. 60fps is plenty if you don't attempt to spoil it all the time with 120fps(Vr not included9@WaveBoy Agreed. For example, playing Metroid Prime Trilogy & Resident Evil 4 on Wii is by far the best way to play those games, with the motion aiming alone. I'm definitely interested In PSVR2 to play RE2 & RE Village with motion controls. I skipped PSVR, so I didn't get to try RE7 in VR...@Nepp67 I actually didn’t know that. Thanks.@Kidfunkadelic83 These are native PS5 versions, they even have their own trophy lists.@SCHONBOB No problem, I prefer to have them on cause if it's implemented well it'll help me enjoy a game more like Warframe and I didn't like Warframe all that muchPretty funny how the PC crowd is whining about the new updates to these RE games because it ramped up the system requirements and the games don't run well on their old PC's anymore. Plus more importantly for most of them, the big booby mods don't work anymore. I've never understood gaming with a low end PC, just go console at that point.@carlos82 The ps4 version looks like the worst of both worlds lol!Thanks for the share Carlos (isn't that the officer's name in the game?)@WallyWest that was my fault and i completely worded it wrong. What i was meaning was any copy of the games, be it didital or physical would be eligible for the upgrade. I was having a moment 😂@Kidfunkadelic83 Ahh i get you haha@WaveBoy Now I think your just making stuff up 🙈@WaveBoy I am under the impression that every 16.6ms an entirely new frame is drawn. I play old retro games on my TV and the movement is perfectly smooth to me. Pixel incrementation per frame for scrolling looks identical(CRT TVs literally keep 50% of the last frame on screen in interlaced form)@carlos82 Thanks for the confirmation. I should have known they would look better on the PS5 automatically, but you never know. Some developers do half ass these things, but it's nice to see Capcom didn't really.I'll probably just go with the regular 4K/60 mode, as while I do like RT when it's implemented really well, I think the high resolution and the steady 60 FPS will be good enough. That is unless some have exaggerated how much the RT drags down the framerate.@Keyblade-Dan yeah I'm replaying resident evil 2 on my PS4 pro & it's just an absolutely stunning game & the frame rate is really smooth , still claimed the ps5 versions For when I eventually get one because why not@KilloWertz as for framerate I will say I beat it on hardcore difficulty in RT mode with little problem and even 4th Survivor. The framerate is certainly noticable in and around the main hall which as the first main area maybe puts people off but outside of that I'd say it was solid for the most part.@Would_you_kindly Yeah again they're free so exactly why not? But given that apparently the upgrades have these drawbacks and the original PS4 versions of 7 and 2R are pretty much perfect in my eyes I probably won't waste my PS5's storage space on these 😅The Haptic feedback & adaptive triggers are disappointing really  (I want it to be like Astro's Playroom. Well EVERY game be like Astro's Playroom. Feedback wise)  & I wasn't really impressed with any of it(it was ok)  I don't know people nowadays just get obsessed about all the graphics stuff.

Resident Evil 2,Greg Bargas,PC Invasion,https://www.pcinvasion.com/review/resident-evil-2-review-survival-horror-revival/,"As I timidly started towards the gas station as Claire in the Resident Evil 2 remake, I’ll admit I was a bit torn. When the first few minutes of the story unfolded, it became easy to see that this wasn’t the game that I had become fond of in my adolescent years.The most noticeable change from the original was the action-oriented playstyle. I’m not sure why this bothered me at first. I guess this might have been a lie I was telling myself. “If too many things are different, then there’s no way it could be as good as the original.”As I continued to play, it became more apparent that many of the core gameplay mechanics were still present. Limited inventory space and scarce ammo still provided a steady stream of anxiety. I never thought a game that I would consider worthy of the masterpiece label could coexist with its modern rendition. That is, until I had played through Capcom’s new take on its own classic.
In Resident Evil 1, much of the core exploration takes place inside a massive, puzzle-ridden mansion. There are a number of different enemies and obstacles to overcome as you fight your way out of this hellacious palace. Resident Evil 2 took that same approach, only this time trapping the main protagonists inside of a police station against the backdrop of a massive city-wide outbreak.The important thing to note is just how much happens within the confines of a single inner-city police precinct. You’ll find weapons and ammo amidst the clutches of zombies. You’ll discover secret passages and rooms while an unrelenting creature (Mr. X, aka the Tyrant) tears through walls to get to you. The impressive thing is that the majority of the action and story happen in a single location. Through this design decision, gameplay becomes much more of a focus, almost demanding that it be the most polished setpiece within the experience.
As mentioned earlier, I didn’t quite know how I felt about Resident Evil 2 including more modernized controls and action elements. For better or worse, this provides a much broader spectrum of appeal, catering to those outside of the hardcore fan cliques.There have been litters of Resident Evil titles that have come and gone since the release of the original Resident Evil 2. However, the one thing that I couldn’t stop thinking about was how much Resident Evil 4 offered new beginnings to the franchise with its change in gameplay, much like how Resident Evil 7 has done in recent years. Capcom then embraced concepts that made both of these titles great, surprisingly turning out something that wasn’t an abomination. Instead, this concept and execution have proven that this was the right time for a revival.
There’s more to a game than just adding pretty visuals and action game controls. There was a noticeable curation process in terms of balancing mechanics, action, and gameplay. This new design for the franchise has allowed it to reach a much wider audience, one that might have found the original tank controls and RPG elements not to their liking.The Resident Evil 2 remake is still very much about deciphering puzzles, item scarcity, and reading through notes discovered as you explore. The game is a product of evolution, while still bearing many of the recognizable traits that made it unique in the first place. Things like inventory management are still part of the survival process, and limited ammunition can stir up panic in mere seconds. Other aspects like backtracking don’t seem as cumbersome without a fixed view, which was more representative of hardware limitations at the time than of design.Prior to the full review, I had run through the game’s visual performance, also touching on its audio design. The game runs impressively well visually, and having Dolby Atmos support is a huge plus. These elements, coupled with solid gameplay mechanics, offer a story worth retelling. Funnily enough, it’s almost akin to the live-action Disney movies that have been coming down the pipeline. Although they may never be as good as the originals, they at least allow the viewer to see things through an alternate narrative lens, keeping most of the focal points in place that made the experience stand out in the first place.
I was surprised to see that the 1-Shot Demo was going to be something as brief as it was. There were 30 minutes of gameplay, offering you a chance to see the game’s character models and a snippet of what the NPCs would bring to the table. However, when the final game released, I couldn’t help feeling that some more time incubating could have fixed some minor woes.Many of the character models of the game have changed to better reflect the timeframe in which the events occur. Leon S. Kennedy is visibly younger in the face, portraying a less-seasoned Mr. Kennedy than we are used to seeing. Claire, too, sports a different character model and voice. Both are welcome adjustments in order to provide a convincing timeline of events. However, these instances are interrupted with subpar facial animations that simply detracted from the dire sequence of events unfolding within them. Even the first run-in with William Birkin contradicted the production pedigree that the rest of the game boasts. These are but minor nitpicks, but the frequency in which they occur leave them too hard not to notice.I had a very real fear that a reimagining of Resident Evil 2 would break something that I had grown to love since I was a child. Over the years, the franchise has gone through its ups and its downs (Resident Evil 6/Operation Raccoon City). However, the visuals and sound design guided this experience back to its roots, something that few franchises manage.Although I felt it could have spent some more time in incubation for very minor details and polish, the rest of the game provides an experience for both newcomers and veterans alike.This wasn’t the first time we’ve experienced the incident in Raccoon City or met Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield. However, Capcom has done this in such a way that it feels like the first time I stepped foot on those chaotic streets as Claire, feverish with fear, pistol in hand, barely ready for what lay ahead.The core mechanics of the original are still very present, even amongst a more action-focused playstyle. If anything, this has widened the audience reach to those who've never played the original and want to enjoy a hearty helping of panic and inventory stress.About Us

Resident Evil 2,Nicholas Leon,Gaming Nexus,https://www.gamingnexus.com/Article/5881/Resident-Evil-2-Remake/,"Perhaps one of the best parts about the recent remake of Resident Evil 2, the latest in a slew of remarkable rereleases of the classic horror series, is not the many times the player will be shakily adjusting their aim to get a headshot on an undead, or when the tension of sneaking past a sound-sensitive enemy makes them shake, or when they have to scramble their sound plans when an unexpected enemy appears, but simply when the player directs the character to run. All those other moments are tense and brilliant as well, but the difference between the moments is the refreshing serenity of simply watching Leon or Claire jog from one place to another.I say this because it is one of the most immediate ways to see how the game, in its current iteration, has changed from its original form. Many are aware of how the series hit a low point with action-oriented gameplay, and then made a comeback with Resident Evil 7. This game uses the same engine as that entry, but with the key difference being a return to the over-the-shoulder, third-person perspective that revolutionized the series all those years ago.If I could make only a slightly stretched analogy, I would say that this game is like a restored Mustang your motor head neighbor is constantly working on, only they aren’t afraid to take it out more than one weekend at a time. In essence, it is more than just an old game with a fresh coat of paint. Paced just slow enough to make the player think, and filled with enough tension and flow to keep the player going even after they might think they’ve hit a dead end, Resident Evil 2 combines enough elements to freshen up an older title and bring its flavor to the contemporary era.But to get back to that bit about the perspective. To me, it signifies the way in which so much can change upon the altering of one simple mechanic. As fans know, the original version had a fixed camera angle, this release obviously changes that with the free spinning camera, but more than that, it presents a newer way in which the series as a whole approaches its design. Whether it’s long, narrow hallways or even wide open chambers, there are always new modes with which to either challenge or scare the crap out of the player.From absolute darkness, to murky water, to tradeoffs between rushing through a packed room just to get a critical item or popping off a few bullets to either stagger or put down enemies for a few seconds at a time. At the end of my time with the game, it was really the mechanics, visuals, and generally just the more physical aspects that stuck with me the most.The writing between main characters Leon and Claire is corny at times, like they are trying to flirt and they either have no chemistry or are just really awkward. Fortunately, every other character interaction feels genuine and at times a playful sort of serious. One item of importance should be noted, however. With two characters come two different gameplay experiences. I first played as Leon because honestly who doesn’t love a man in a uniform, committed to his job one hundred percent of the time? It took me eight hours to complete the first playthrough, and as of writing, I just started on the game’s 2nd Run, which runs through the game’s story from the other character’s perspective, which allow for a different experience in narrative and even certain mechanics, such as access to different areas and weapons.The most potent way that this game succeeds is how it coaches the player to continue on, despite the odds. I recall many times where, in my first run, I found myself either trapped or out of ammo, with knowledge of only one route out of my predicament. One notable example was when I was running through a garage packed with the series’ notorious zombie dogs. I dropped into a safe room through a sewer grate, and could considered my options. I had one route leading back to the main hub area, but it was locked off because of an earlier boss fight, so that led to the jail cells that I finally had a critical component for in order to reboot the power. The only obstacle were those mangy mutts. Seeing as it was either cower in the safe room, waiting for nothing, or brazenly charge out into near-certain death in hopes of completing my objective. Opting for the ladder, I made my way back to the jail cells using my memory of that particular setting’s layout, and was able to move onto the next area.That sort of method, of always keeping the player on their toes, but giving them the tools they need not only through mechanics, but recognizable setting and design, is what sets Resident Evil 2 apart from its contemporaries. There are no icons that represent needless side objectives, and no areas that look identical to each other, just an experience where the player learns, with equal dependence and independence, what they have to do to progress. Now that I am in my 2nd Run, I find myself familiar enough with the game world that I rarely need to consult the map.Okay, but enough about how much I find refreshing in this game. The graphics are fantastic, the movement and camera are pretty fluid, and the design exceeds my expectations for a contemporary release. The only element that I find myself having a slight issue with, however, is the combat and the way in which it affects the pacing.Playing on normal difficulty, I found the gunplay challenging. The zombies don’t move in an altogether predictable manner, not extremely slow ramblers like in The Walking Dead. They sway and shamble in ways that will throw off even the most careful sharpshooter. So, if the player wants to score a headshot, they need to be patient up to the moment the reticle aligns with the cranium, otherwise, it will just be a lot of bullets flying into walls and windows. Consequently, it is a constant gamble whether to utilize what little ammo is on hand, hence the numerous times that I ran out of it. But, as aforementioned, the game always provided me a way out. One of these ways is to dodge into rooms, be it safe rooms or others, where enemies are mostly unable to enter. These safe havens provide ways for players to reconsider their paths should enemies hound them to the point of either low health or low ammo, and are much appreciated. However, as helpful as it constantly proves to be, it soon becomes a repetitive practice to dodge in after receiving damage and just try to start for a new passage to the objective. I don’t see any way around this, however, as it really would stink if zombies were able to invade my safe room.At the end of the night, Resident Evil 2 always leaves the player wanting more. Whether it's the key item critically needed to unlock a new weapon, or the temptation to explore the world to get the combination to a safe that just might have a direly needed health item. It's a great mix of old and new gameplay mechanics that make for a truly unique entry in this generation. Resident Evil 2 is a breath of fresh (or should I say foul and dead?) air into the bloated world of open-ended gameplay mechanics that, instead of leaving the player feeling empty and exhausted for the amount of options, leave them with a constant sense of tension but knowledge and will to push on. Truly an innovation that proves its necessity. * The product in this article was sent to us by the developer/company.I am Nicholas Leon.

	Att göra om en älskad spelklassiker från grunden är ingen lätt uppgift, men Capcom lyckas utmärkt. Resident Evil 2 var väl värt all väntan.Få spel har lyckats traumatisera så många prepubertala pojkar och flickor som Resident Evil 2. Capcoms numera ikoniska skildring av zombiekatastrofen i Raccoon City från 1998 ses rent allmänt som ett av de bästa spelen i Resident Evil-serien, och byggde vidare på det genredefinierande koncept för överlevnadsskräck som cementerades av det första spelet 1996.Styltiga kontroller, låsta kameravinklar och ett av 90-talets lökigaste dialogmanuskript har dock inte behandlats särskilt väl av tidens tand. Den fantastiska Gamecube-remaken av Resident Evil från 2002 må ha lyckats på dessa premisser, men 17 år senare krävs det mer av Capcom för att göra uppföljaren relevant.Med åren har skräckserien samlat på sig en enorm, krävande fan-skara och redan i januari står det klart att nya Resident Evil 2 är ett av årets mest emotsedda spelsläpp. Själva spelmekaniken i Resident Evil 2 anno 2019 har dock genomgått såpass fundamentala förändringar att vi inte pratar om en renodlad nyversion. Den låsta kameran har bytts ut mot en dynamisk över axeln-vinkel som följer den nybakade polisen Leon S Kennedy och människorättsaktivisten Claire Redfield på ett helt nytt sätt.Läs även: Resident Evil HD Remaster: Skräckklassikern håller fortfarandeDe olika rum vi tar oss emellan är inte längre isolerade zoner, utan såväl protagonister som zombiefierade poliskonstaplar kan fritt röra sig mellan dem i realtid. Även om miljöerna och storyn känns igen så har förutsättningarna för hur vi tar oss an Resident Evil 2 helt kastats överbord till förmån för något nytt.Detta faktum resulterar i en mängd olika upplevelser – både lysande och mindre lyckade sådana. Den skräckinjagade atmosfären skruvas upp ytterligare några snäpp. Panik och hjälplöshet råder när vi famlar oss fram i mörka, vindlande korridorer med ett halvdussin 9-millimeterspatroner och det flackande ljusskenet från ficklampan som enda sällskap.Lemlästade människokroppar ligger strödda överallt, och vi har inte en aning om hur många av dem som planerar att resa sig upp och stönande börja hasa efter oss. ""Varför DÖR du inte?!"" skriker vi desperat efter att ha pepprat en fetlagd zombiepolis med bly ett tiotal gånger. Sjok av ruttnande människokött faller ned på golvet i en morbid avklädningsprocess. Till sist faller även vår motståndare, bara för att resa sig någon minut senare och fortsätta jaga oss genom Raccoon Citys polishus.Nästa fiende lyckas vi blåsa skallen av med ett enda, välriktat skott. Från likets bröst rycker vi den kniv vi tvingades försvara oss med efter att ha klivit runt ett hörn och blivit överrumplade.Reaktionsbaserade vapen som används i självförsvarssyfte gör en välkommen comeback i Resident Evil 2 och är oerhört viktiga med tanke på att fienderna är snabbare och mer seglivade än någonsin.Överraskningar, jump-scares och ren slumpmässighet gör Resident Evil 2 till något av det obehagligaste vi över huvud taget spelat. Det är oerhört snålt med såväl hälsoföremål som ammunition och aldrig tidigare har vi behövt vara så noga med att välja våra strider. Att i lugn och ro söka igenom varje område efter resurser och nödvändiga nyckelobjekt är bara att glömma, för oftast är du jagad av någonting.För att inte avslöja för mycket kan vi berätta att du blir jagad av just ""någonting"" – alltså en specifik karaktär – under flera längre sekvenser i framför allt polishuset. Precis som i fallet med Nemesis från Resident Evil 3 dyker denna fiende upp i tid och otid, men till skillnad från samma spel går det inte att fly förrän vi utfört en specifik handling som tar huvudstoryn vidare.De första minuterna av katt och råtta-lek är förtjusande skräckinjagande; vi gömmer oss i ett förråd och lyssnar på mullrande fotsteg utanför dörren. Vi blir nästan alltid upptäckta och har i stort sett inga medel för självförsvar. Till slut blir flyendet mest tröttsamt och irriterande. Vi inser att det är en smaksak huruvida man uppskattar den konstanta flykten. När Jack Baker terroriserade oss på samma sätt i Resident Evil 7 upplevde vi det som storydrivande och relevant. Denna gång kan vi inte låta bli att känna att Capcom lagt lite för mycket fokus på samma koncept – särskilt i jämförelse med hur det fungerade i Resident Evil 2 från 1998.Att tvingas panikspringa igenom de grafiskt fenomenala miljöerna i jakt på rätt nyckel eller handlingssekvens går ut över helhetsupplevelsen på ett sätt vi inte är helt bekväma med. För oss är Resident Evil 2 synonymt med att taktfast nysta upp de hemligheter som omgärdar polisstationen – men 2019 är de möjligheterna kraftigt begränsade.Resident Evil 2 bjuder dock på långt fler ändringar än det tempomässiga. Spelet har fått sig en genomgående modernisering. Visuellt sett är spelet magnifikt; Capcom har experimenterat mycket med den mörkare delen av färgpaletten för att skapa en ny typ av utmaning.Det är svårt att orientera sig och hinna upptäcka fiender i tid, vilket naturligtvis bidrar till den härliga survival horror-känsla som varit utvecklarens signum från första början. Spelet osar av atmosfär på ett sätt som få kan mäta sig med.Såväl huvudpersonerna Leon och Claire som de fascinerande karaktärer vi möter under resans gång har fått mer genomtänkta modeller och mindre ostiga dialoger. Mötena med andra överlevande driver berättelsen på ett tydligare sätt än 1998 och vi får lättare att relatera till karaktärerna. Särskilt då Leon och Claire, som precis som i originalet möter olika personer.En andra genomspelning är därför högt rekommenderad. När du klarat spelet en gång låser du dessutom upp ett andra scenario, som ändrar en del på skeendena i spelet. Med undantag för ett spontant möte tidigt i spelet och en handfull kvarlämnade lappar är interaktionen mellan Leon och Claire ännu mer sparsmakad än i originalspelet. Sidokaraktärerna vi möter kan till viss del kompensera för detta, men när avslutningen ska knytas ihop känns återföreningen lite överspelad sett till hur få minuter karaktärerna spenderat tillsammans. Vi hade gärna sett att de utsattes för någon gemensam fara och behövde samarbeta på något sätt, men man kan inte få allt här i världen.Polisstation, kloaker, forskningslabb. Vi färdas genom välbekanta miljöer och njuter av vår nyvunna frihet. Den nya kameravinkeln känns perfekt från minut ett och det moderna kontrollschemat är svårt att anmärka på. Vi kan numera gå och skjuta samtidigt, men fortfarande finns en viss klumpighet i rörelseschemat. Antagligen ett medvetet val av Capcom för att hålla såväl skräckfaktor som svårighetsgrad uppe. Tankenötterna och de små pusslen lever kvar men har även de gjorts lite mer moderna och är för det mesta riktigt roliga att ge sig på.Under de åtta timmar som en första genomspelning tar (scenario 2 betade vi av på fem timmar) infinner sig en växande känsla av respekt för Capcom, som verkligen lyckats hitta en väl fungerande balans mellan gammalt och nytt. Igenkänningsfaktorn är hög samtidigt som vi hela tiden blir överraskade av alla finurliga justeringar som gjorts för att ge nytt liv åt ett 21 år gammalt mästerverk.Vi må inte vara helt överens med alla aspekter av det uppskruvade tempot, men Resident Evil 2 är i stort och smått en väldigt väl genomförd modernisering. Grafiken är på topp, atmosfären i det närmaste oslagbar och nyheterna kring kameravinkel och kontroller levererar över förväntan. Nu väntar vi på samma behandling av Resident Evil 3: Nemesis!Läs mer: Fler spelrecensioner hittar du på m3.se/gamingGenre: Överlevnadsskräck. Utvecklare: Capcom. Utgivare: Capcom.

Resident Evil 2,Adam Byrne,PlayStation Universe,https://www.psu.com/reviews/ps4-resident-evil-2-remake/," Adam Byrne / January 22, 2019Full disclosure – the original Resident Evil 2 is my favorite game of all time.I remember it like it was yesterday; scouring the local newsagents for any magazine that had a morsel of news as the release date crept ever closer. It felt like an age – no doubt lengthened by the game’s well-documented development woes following the surprise success of the Sweet Home-inspired original.Ironically, perhaps, when it finally did arrive in April of 1998 I spent the vast majority of my time cowered behind the couch, as my uncle – who had kick-started my fondness for the series by gifting me an issue of Play Magazine that featured the Spencer Mansion’s window-smashing dog on its cover – went through the motions of uncovering the secrets of the Raccoon City Police Department. Though we never did quite uncover why there wasn’t a bathroom in the entire building, mind.It was the guttural, deep sound of the zombies; the foreboding sense of urgency that was then replaced by the slow-paced meticulous nature of the RPD itself. In truth, there hasn’t been a survival horror game that has had as profound an effect on me as Resident Evil 2. It was a natural evolution from its predecessor – larger, more intricate, technically sounder, and far more grandiose in its narrative.It planted the seed and set the tempo for future releases to come so it’s perhaps fitting, then, that this remake some twenty years later tightens and expands these advancements and presents the maiden story of Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield in a smarter, more refined, and tense fashion. Make no mistake, the Resident Evil 2 remake doesn’t simply retread old ground, it repaves it.It was an unenviable task that developer Capcom faced, that’s for sure, having to systematically overhaul the second entry in one of its premier franchises to a more drastic degree than that of its stunning effort with original Resident Evil back in 2002. Times have changed and so has certain development sensibilities, so there has much more on the line – and indeed much more room to slip up – when trying to modernize Resident Evil 2’s key components, such as its ‘zapping system’ and its popular set of characters.For the remake, the dual campaigns are back, with one for both Leon and Claire; completing one will unlock the ‘B-side’ of the other, which changes the introduction up a little and some other small aspects. Leon is still imbued with that innate sense of duty, whilst Claire acts as the spunky counterweight, quick to stand up and be counted on when push comes to shove.Though their character outlines remain mostly intact, Capcom has added substantially to each, creating a level of depth and relatability that really makes you empathize with their conjoined plight. Graphical advancements in the last twenty years would of course dictate that both protagonists will be more expressive, emotive, and realistic, but the great writing, added interactions, and overall tension that is borne out of the ambiance and how they react to the horror means that this is without a doubt the most well-rounded iteration of each character to date.What perhaps wasn’t as expected, however, is just how the game treats its eclectic cast of side characters. There’s been a lot of discussion leveled towards which creatures have and have not made the cut this time around but one of the most remarkable aspects of this remake, especially for those with an affinity for the original, is the amount of additional characterization and depth that has been afforded to virtually every single side character along the way.Some of these appearances are fleeting, sure, whilst others are given more prominent roles in the overall story, but irrespective of screen time you’ll come out the other side with an added appreciation for each due to the care that Capcom has evidently put in. Without veering into spoiler territory, Annette Birkin’s role in both campaigns is night and day compared to that of the original; she’s now a multifaceted character with agency who’s intrinsic to the game’s narrative.Her arc just makes a lot more sense in the context of this reimagining. There are other examples, too, as each character brings a mature weight to proceedings, but in terms of a contrast between both games Annette is certainly the starkest.Fundamentally, Resident Evil is about management; negotiating the balance between risk versus reward. We’ve all been there. Your health is on ‘caution’, you’ve just gotten a precinct key that’s paved the way to a new area but you’re low on ammunition. You unlock the door and it creaks open, unveiling three or four shambling zombies; you turn around, straight back the way you came.You start to form a plan: should you use the 6 handgun bullets you’ve got left? Should you kill the first one and then try and bait the rest to give you space to run past? Classic Resident Evil asks questions of its players and expects solutions based upon logical assessment. While this ethos has been diluted in later releases, it’s back here in spades. Resident Evil 2 Remake is a tense experience through and through. It can be bloody difficult, too.The word ‘relentless’ comes to mind immediately. The iconic RPD building is now a mixture of dimmed light and darkness, with zombies placed in well-trodden areas and narrow hallways. They’re aggressive, persistent, and should never be underestimated. 20 handgun bullets may seem generous in comparison to the paltry offerings in the original, but zombies can now routinely take six shots directly to the head and still get up to just absorb another half a clip with ease. It forces you to be strategic. Some may find their resilience to be a shortcoming or indeed overkill, but to me it feels designed to elicit that feeling of claustrophobia and impotency. And it works.Add the stoic persistence of Mr. X into the mix and the game can get quite stressful as you backtrack and open new areas with the aforementioned tyrant in tow. One thing to note – aside from the fact that Lickers are a nightmare this time around and can make use of vents – is just how layered each of the enemies are. They’re far more intelligent, multidimensional and can often surprise you with their ability to inflict damage from a starting point you’d normally gauge as safe.Some will decry the lack of certain enemies, namely that of spiders, and though that is unfortunate, the game never feels as though it’s lacking in the enemy variety department simply because there’s so many variables at the heart of these encounters. There are numerous instances of entering a room only to be faced with multiple zombies closing in on your position while the sound of menacing footsteps can be heard from behind.Practically no area is safe, either. The station itself has retained its iconic atmosphere and its modernized layout works brilliantly. The backtracking has purpose; the key items are well designed, and the constant threat of Mr. X pushes the pace well. What’s interesting is how Capcom has managed to retain tension with its contemporary camera view and controls.The original Resident Evil 2 used its limitations smartly to increase the stress of the game; the fixed cameras hid areas where enemies could lurk, and the tank-like controls dictated that you couldn’t turn on a dime. This time around both Leon and Claire control very fluidity but despite this you’re still vulnerable and at the behest of the enemies.Surprisingly, Capcom has plumped for a decidedly minimalist soundtrack with a greater emphasis on spatial sound effects which’ll undoubtedly be to the chagrin of veteran players. As a compromise the old-school OST and sound effect swap is wonderful, but that’s unfortunately locked behind more expensive editions of the game. For what Capcom is trying to achieve, however, the new sound setup oozes atmosphere, and the distant footsteps of Mr. X are as effective in subsequent playthroughs.Like Resident Evil 7’s Baker estate, the RPD building feels lived in, and it’s still one of the most affecting locales in gaming. For those pining for some more city-based exploration, however, you’re fresh out of luck. It now takes less time to reach the entrance to the police station than in the original. And though you do venture out into the city briefly in both campaigns separately, the remake does by-and-large follow the same story beats albeit jumbled up a bit.The city parts are extremely linear, too, which is a real shame, as Raccoon City is as much a character as anybody in the series. Though city exploration is the real focal point of Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, it would’ve been nice to at least be able to enter different storefronts, however small, and it would’ve added some of the environmental depth that’s so present in every other portion of the game.Despite its linearity, the rain-sodden streets of Raccoon City are positively gorgeous, and the game as a whole is quite a technical feat. The environments are, for the most part, richly detailed and paint a picture of unbridled chaos with blood splashes affixed to every crevice and books and posters strewn across top surfaces and floors. The use of sterile, cold colours in later areas also acts as a nice contrast to the mahogany-tinged walls of the RPD.That said, there seems to be slight issue, especially in the latter part of the game, where reflections from metallic surfaces don’t cast the image on the floor in front of you correctly. It sort of shimmers and can be a bit distracting with how frequent it is. On the other hand, the facial capture and emotive animation are top notch and bring so much life to each character on-screen.Though nostalgia certainly plays a part in seeing these characters more fully realized, you can really feel the struggle and desperation on some of their faces. Also look out for the burger in the opening shot of the game – it’s a real looker. In terms of graphical options, the game doesn’t support a distinction between 4K/30 frames per second or 1080p/60 frames per second for PS4 Pro users like was previously reported, instead Capcom opted for a 4K display with a variable frame rate as standard. It feels great and is definitely holding an average above 30 frames per second which is commendable given the Pro’s specifications.In many ways, Capcom has achieved the near-impossible with the remake of Resident Evil 2. It’s a remarkable labour of design, iteration, faithfulness, and adaptation; a masterclass in knowing what to change, how to change it, and what to build upon. Sure, there are some slight niggles and design choices that perhaps long-time fans won’t appreciate but there’s no denying that Capcom has been bold in its design philosophy and has exuded a confidence and consistency in its execution throughout.The biggest compliment that can be leveled is how the game manages to elicit the same sense of dread and consequence that made the original a classic whilst injecting just enough complexity and modern sensibility to see it emerge from the shadow of its namesake with consummate ease.Published and developed by Capcom, Resident Evil 2 releases on January 25, 2019 for PS4, Xbox One and PC.Capcom has achieved the near-impossible with the remake of Resident Evil 2.

Not the kind of obsessive love that results in remakes unchanged apart from graphics, but instead a love that wants to see this classic reborn at its absolute best – with whatever changes it takes to achieve that.
No doubt some tweaks will be divisive, but this is a remake done right. It’s been modernised without feeling modern, built primarily for the fans, while welcoming new players so long as they’re willing to meet it in the middle.The Resident Evil franchise isn’t short on beloved entries (or maligned ones, to be fair) but Resident Evil 2 in particular has stuck in gamers’ consciousness as a series highlight.That’s why it’s no real surprise that Capcom decided to give it the remake treatment, rebuilding the game from the ground up in 
Resident Evil 7’s engine. I’ve spent the weekend screaming from my sofa at the 
Resident Evil 2 remake, playing through by Claire and Leon’s campaigns to find out what’s new, what’s old, and why the hell the Tyrant won’t just leave me alone.Out on PC, Xbox One, and PS4 from 25 January, the Resident Evil 2 remake comes with the usual choice between a standard edition and a 
deluxe version, which includes a few alternative costumes and the brilliant option to play with the original soundtrack. You can order it right now from 
Amazon in the US or 
Game in the UK if you’re so inclined.Including fan service options like the original soundtrack might suggest that this is a slavish reproduction of the 1998 original, but this isn’t quite so faithful. Sure, like the original game this features separate campaigns for the game’s two protagonists, Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield, as they fight through the overrun Raccoon City, but each of those stories has been tweaked and improved, to both keep things fresh for returning players and improve the appeal for newer victims.Take the Kendo Gun Shop for example. Anyone with fond memories of the original may be disappointed to run through the early game without setting foot in the store. But without giving anything away, the store (and its owner) pop up later in the story, and that new context is used to tweak the tone and content of the scene to better suit the new story.Those kinds of changes have been made throughout the game, in ways both big and small. From the order you meet certain characters, to the way boss fights play out, even down to the nature of the story’s MacGuffins, it’s clear that every detail of the game – mechanics, music, story and more – has been questioned and considered.None of which is to say that it’s all new, and in fact you might be surprised by some of what’s been left behind. You’ll still heal with herbs, save at typewriters, and spend at least half of your playtime battling with the nostalgically clunky inventory system.Those typewriters are now backed up by frequent autosaves though, and you’ll now be able to focus on fighting the undead without clashing with the controls: yup, the much maligned tank controls are gone in favour of the over-the-shoulder camera and responsive controls of Resident Evil 4.I have a soft spot for the old Resi system, which made up in tension and claustrophobia what it lost in accessibility. The fixed camera angles always held the possibility of something or other lurking just out of sight, and the fear was heightened thanks to the knowledge that just trying to turn around and run away would probably take you about half a minute.Still, there’s a balance here, and this remake feels just as grounded in horror as 2017’s Resident Evil 7, rather than a return to the action games of the series’ nadir. Claire and Leon are still slow – agonisingly so when you’re trying to sprint down a corridor to the percussive rhythm of the Tyrant’s footsteps behind you – ammo is tight, and zombies are plentiful. Not in a ‘kill them all!’ way, but in the proper ‘panic and run and hope’ because there are way too many of them to manage kind of way.Shiny new graphics add realism to the horror, but as always it’s the enhanced audio that really matters: you begin to obsess about every creak and footstep, the pounds and shrieks of the soundtrack blurring together with the creatures that stalk the police station, sewers and streets of the city.The graphics do come into their own too though. Aside from adding a lush sheen to the whole game, they bring entirely new life to the characters with facial animations that are another step up from Resident Evil 7. It’s let down a bit by the voice acting – Capcom has drawn recent criticism for the decision to save money with non-union actors, rather than reuniting the original cast – but hammy vocals are as much a staple of Resident Evil as confusingly themed keys, so it’s easy to forgive in the end.Much was made ahead of release of the developers’ suggestion that the remake would no longer feature four different versions of the campaign, but it looks like that was either a case of mistranslation or something changed. Once again you have the choice to play through once as Leon or Claire – with the same basic puzzles, but different weapon options and cut scenes – and completing the game once then unlocks the ‘Second Run’ option, a remixed campaign that lets you experience the events of the original playthrough from the other character’s perspective.That means you’ll at least want to play through the game twice – doing the second run with the other character offers you new weapons, puzzles, story sequences, and more – while the hardcore could play through four times or more, so the game’s not short of replayability. Extra game modes – where you play as fan-favourites Hunk and, uh, Tofu – also appear, so there’s plenty to do.If there’s one thing that’s clear about Resident Evil 2, it’s that it’s a labour of love. Not the kind of obsessive love that results in remakes unchanged apart from graphics, but instead a love that wants to see this classic reborn at its absolute best – with whatever changes it takes to achieve that.No doubt some tweaks will be divisive. There are already fans lamenting the loss of tank controls; the plot changes will ignite a whole new wave of arguments about the canon; and expect a lot of people asking why they couldn’t just improve the bloody inventory.But broadly, this is a remake done right. It’s been modernised without feeling modern – you will remain acutely aware that this was a game first designed in the late ’90s – built primarily for the fans, while welcoming new players so long as they’re willing to meet it in the middle. Tech Advisor's Deputy Editor, Dom covers everything that runs on electricity, from phones and laptops to wearables, audio, gaming, smart home, and streaming - plus he's a regular fixture on the Tech Advisor YouTube channel.Tech Advisor's Deputy Editor, Dom covers everything that runs on electricity, from phones and laptops to wearables, audio, gaming, smart home, and streaming - plus he's a regular fixture on the Tech Advisor YouTube channel.PhonesLaptopsTabletsWearable TechHome TechSecurityDigital Magazine - SubscribeNewsletters"
Resident Evil 2,Nathan Birch,Wccftech,https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-2-remake/,"Resident Evil 7 kind of snuck up on survival horror fans. Many of us feared Resident Evil had permanently lost its mojo following a string of disappointing entries, but Capcom proved there was blood left in the horror franchise’s veins with their gutsy sequel. So, how is Capcom following up the surprise success of RE7? With a remake of Resident Evil 2, which celebrated its 20th birthday last year.At first blush, redoing Resident Evil 2 seems like a smart move. The game’s an undisputed classic and fans have been pleading for a remake for years. That said, Resident Evil is arguably at its best when it tries new things, so is this the right time to be rehashing the past? Does Resident Evil 2 hold up in 2019 or has this survival horror staple gone stale? Stock up on green herbs, it’s time to return to Raccoon City…If you’re at all into horror games, or old enough to have owned an OG PlayStation, you probably know Resident Evil 2’s story by heart. Leon Kennedy is a Raccoon City rookie cop destined to have really bad first day at work, while Claire Redfield is a college student searching for her brother Chris Redfield, who disappeared following the events of the first Resident Evil. Upon arriving in Raccoon City, Leon and Claire discover the town is overrun with the undead and take refuge in the city’s weirdly-ornate police station. The two are quickly separated, with Leon wrangling with a giant alligator and femme fatale Ada Wong, while Claire takes on a twisted police chief and the role of surrogate mom when she stumbles across a  precocious 12-year-old named Sherry. Capcom doesn’t mess around with Resident Evil 2’s story much, although some of the more thankless roles have been expanded. Ada gets a bit more love this time around and Annette Birkin is portrayed in a far more nuanced way. Oh, and Chief Irons, a C-level villain at best in the original game, is now a complete bastard.The game’s controls and mechanics are a mashup of classic and modern. The game utilizes an over-the-shoulder camera, but Leon and Claire aren’t particularly quick or athletic. Don’t expect to be dashing around spin-kicking zombies in the face ala Resident Evil 4. Usually the controls aren’t a distraction, as Resident Evil 2 is meant to be a slower, more atmospheric experience, but some of the more action-heavy boss fights will make you wish Leon and Claire would get the lead out of their asses. Limited inventory space and item swapping also make a return, which is what it is. At least you don’t need to collect ink ribbons to save the game anymore.Big picture, Resident Evil 2’s campaign progresses as it always has, although innumerable tweaks both big and small have been made. The changes start out fairly conservative, with the police station feeling fairly familiar. Which is to say, you’ll be doing a lot of running around in circles, unlocking doors, and collecting a vast array of arcane trinkets. Surprisingly, Capcom has actually dialed back the pace of the game’s opening chapters, revealing plot points and new enemies more gradually (it takes quite a bit longer to meet your first licker this time around). I appreciate the restraint and prefer it to the hyperactivity of games like Resident Evil 6, but the game almost verges on too slow early on.Puzzle design remains old-school, arguably to a fault, with a lot of stuff not making much sense in context. Why am I killing myself collecting parts for a bomb to destroy a flimsy wooden barrier when I’m carrying a grenade launcher? Why won’t my character cross an easily-jumpable gap in a walkway unless I place a bookcase precisely under it? Resident Evil 2 does serve up a few decent brainteasers, but this kind of tortured adventure game logic already felt a bit dated in 1998. It’s downright archaic in 2019.As you progress deeper into Resident Evil 2, the changes Capcom has made become more noticeable. The section where you play as Ada is more involved and Sherry gets an entire new scenario – a fun cat-and-mouse game with Chief Irons in an abandoned orphanage that feels very much in the spirit of Resident Evil 7. The game’s later sewer and lab areas have also received significant revamps, including the addition of some nasty new enemy types. I used to find these later parts of the game a bit monotonous, the extra bits you blitzed through after finishing with the police station, but I actually thought they were the best parts of the remake. It makes me wish Capcom had taken a few more risks with the first half of the game. But perhaps I’m being a bit picky – Resident Evil 2’s campaign was, and is, a beautifully structured thing, and it was smart of Capcom to focus on improving the game’s weakest areas. They didn’t change the police station much, because it largely didn’t need changing.While I had a few minor issues with Resident Evil 2’s level design, I loved what Capcom’s done with the game’s enemies. Zombies are now truly intimidating – gurgling monstrosities who will get up after being shot down multiple times and break down doors to chomp on your neck. Lickers are now properly-agile bastards who can attack you from the walls or ceiling. And wait until you meet the new version of the Nemesis-like “Mr. X” Tyrant. There’s nowhere to hide from this guy.The horrors of Resident Evil 2 are elevated by the game’s top-notch visuals. Environments are densely detailed, lighting effects are impressive, characters are wonderfully expressive, and the game’s violence packs a vicious punch. Shooting zombies results in accurate entry and exit wounds, accompanied by gloriously gooey sprays of gore and rotten flesh. It may feel like a slightly unseemly thing to compliment a game for, but there’s a certain art to over-the-top horror violence, and Resident Evil 2 takes it to a new level.Depending on how adept you are at navigating Resident Evil 2’s puzzles and twisted map, your first playthrough should take around 8 to 12 hours. Of course, Leon and Claire both have their own unique stories, and, much like the original game, once you beat the game with one character you can take on a “2nd Run” with the other. Oh, and don’t forget, Hunk and Tofu are in the game, too! If you’re dedicated to seeing and doing it all, expect to spend upwards of 30 hours as a resident of Raccoon City.Review code provided by publisher Capcom.Resident Evil 2 is a polished, respectful remake of a survival horror classic that probably would have benefitted from a slightly more daring approach. Hints of a braver revamp are sprinkled throughout, but it doesn’t take the risks necessary to join the canon of truly great video game remakes. Make no mistake though, if you loved the original Resident Evil 2, you’ll likely love the remake, and new players who can tolerate a few old-school quirks ought to have a gruesome good time as well.

Resident Evil 2,Liam Croft,Push Square,http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/resident_evil_2,"GuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpResident Evil 22019 9.0Game RatingUser Ratings: 128Our Review: Scroll DownYou've got Redfield on youVersion Reviewed: PS4 Pro / EuropeanAttempting to remake what is considered one of the greatest video games of all time has to be both an incredibly exciting and intimidating prospect, but just over three years ago, that’s the exact promise Capcom made. Many consider Resident Evil 2 to be the pinnacle of survival horror after it capitalised on the potential of a cheesy and clunky predecessor with refinements that brought terror to the masses. And 21 years later, it’s ready to wreak havoc across Raccoon City all over again. Resident Evil 2 is an impressively faithful remake, but that’s also arguably its only major flaw.While the release is more commonly referred to as a remake, Resident Evil 2 is just as much of a re-imagining of the 1998 PSone outing. Many memorable locations remain the same, though there are plenty of tweaks and changes, keeping you on your toes. The famous Raccoon Police Department has been lovingly recreated, although walking its hallways in 2019 is more of a streamlined experience. Some puzzles and mechanics are either radically different or have been removed entirely, and certain shortcuts have been stripped from existence. In their place are new rooms to explore, extra items to acquire, and fresh brain teasers to solve that feel slightly more grounded than what we’re used to. Don’t worry, though, each addition and adjustment makes for an even better game. Nothing at street level has been lost to time.It’s when proceedings head underground that alterations really start to have an affect, though. Gone are the spiders, moths, and crows that inhabited the sewers and Umbrella’s laboratories, and the biggest kicker of all is that there’s nothing to replace them. It’s disappointing that some of the original’s more outlandish creatures are nowhere to be seen, especially so when no new terrors have been thrown into the mix. Thankfully, the zombie horde continues to be utterly horrifying.More recent instalments have moved away from the undead, but Resident Evil 2 makes sure that every encounter with a zombie is a potentially tough test. Unloading nearly an entire clip of bullets may not even be enough to down a lonesome straggler, and when it comes to a whole group of them, your best option is to run in the opposite direction. You’re going to need to conserve your ammo for when you really need to use it because with bullets at short supply and zombies that refuse to stay in their graves, this is a hostile environment that works against your chances of survival in every single engagement.This all helps to create an extremely tense atmosphere that’ll have you on edge at all times. A wave of nostalgia is sure to bring a smile to your face when you first reach the police department’s main lobby, but turn to the right and take a peek under the shutter leading to the east wing and that is sure to dissipate in an instant. Without electricity to fuel lighting, many of the rooms off to either side of the goddess statue are in total darkness. With only a torch on hand to aid navigation, initially you’ll fumble about the place, bumping into one too many zombies that would love nothing more than to sink their teeth into your flesh. But with further exposure comes experience. You’ll never feel completely comfortable exploring an entirely new area, but once you’ve got a grip on how the game expects you to play, you can start to make some real progress. The undead are always a major threat, though, and as a matter of fact, there’s another foe that is going to cause you even more problems.Mr X has to be one of the most frightening enemies we’ve ever come across in a video game. The T-00 stalks your every move at certain parts of the game, and when he’s on your tail, the tension and adrenaline rush fly off the chart. The great thud of his boots across the wooden floorboards is enough to scare even the most hardened veterans, so much so that you’ll want to avoid him at all opportunities. Gunshots draw his attention, and if he discovers your hiding place nearby, taking one of his blows to the face could prove fatal. Not even save rooms or the main lobby area are safe places to take a breather anymore. This continuous sense of dread combined with the roaming zombie population makes for a tense and terrifying trip across Raccoon City.When you compare the 2019 release with what was achievable on the PSone, the biggest difference between the two is quite clearly the visuals and a camera positioned just behind the shoulder. Each and every locale has been recreated with a great deal of care, while character models look superb. It’s not quite on the same level as 2018’s heavy hitters God of War or Red Dead Redemption 2, but the experience is still an extraordinary one from a visual design point. Taking potshots at zombies causes their flesh to chip away and decay in real time, while their stumbling motions along corridors is as lifelike as it can get.Elsewhere, the remake brings with it sweeping changes to mechanics and the user interface to make for easier navigation. After being developed with the RE Engine that powered Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, Capcom has adopted that same inventory and map design for Resident Evil 2. And to say that this update aids the experience would be an understatement. The inventory screen makes for easy reading with clear options that assist when combining items or inspecting them, while the map screen takes note of the items you don’t pick up along the way as well as highlighting locked doors along with text that tells you which key you need in order to head inside. It’s a great help that takes away some of the potential frustration felt when backtracking for items once you’ve found their use.One mechanic that is nowhere to be seen though is the zapping system, a feature that allowed you to store equipment and ammunition in chests to be picked up on alternate playthroughs. As such, every item you find can only be used by the character you’re currently playing as. It’s not a big deal, but purists may understandably feel a little let down with the omission.Resident Evil 2 is famed for its two alternating scenarios, and the plights of both Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield make their return with two campaigns that are actually a lot more similar than what we envisioned. Of course the twosome have separate reasons and motivations for being in the city at first, but both quickly find themselves wrapped up in a quest to take down Umbrella. They share objectives, visit the exact same locations, and face much of the same bosses. There is slight variation in terms of the characters they meet though – Leon teams up with Ada Wong and Claire helps Sherry in escaping the city.For Ms Redfield, this does open up a whole new area never before seen in the PSone original. The orphanage focuses on Sherry’s escape from the dirty clutches of the Raccoon Police Department’s chief, and it makes for a whole set of exhilarating sequences. It can be considered a worthy addition to the overall narrative that makes you feel for the child that little bit more.There’s so much to praise in Resident Evil 2, but unfortunately, there’s one hold back. The remake attempts to be so faithful to the original text, to the point where that becomes a flaw. It’s a strange one because Capcom has set out and achieved exactly what it wanted to do: create an honourable remake of Resident Evil 2. But in doing so, it has also proved just how far games have come since the days of the fifth generation of consoles. Video games simply aren’t designed this way anymore, and despite a number of changes and refinements, gameplay is still going to feel a little too archaic for some. Inventory limits will continue to frustrate newcomers, the lack of any real story setup may disappoint those who were looking for further lore, and the short supply of bullets may leave some stuck in a rut. The Japanese bigwig has remained loyal to its 1998 masterpiece, but 21 years later, not all of those mechanics manage to hold up when it comes to an experience that plays well.During our time with the game pre-release, we rolled the credits on three separate playthroughs. Our initial foray lasted just under eight hours, but subsequent runs shortened to roughly three and a half. Multiple playthroughs are most definitely encouraged thanks to unlocks and ranks to achieve, although there are other modes to take a stab at outside of the two main campaigns. Hunk’s brutally difficult scramble for extraction from Raccoon City’s sewers makes a return, as well as the comedic Tofu. They’re two welcome modes that will prolong your time with the remake that little bit more.Resident Evil 2 might be one of the most accomplished remakes of the generation. A number of mechanics have been updated and introduced in order to bring the game into the modern era, but this is still very much the classic experience you remember – inventory management, limited ammunition, and all. Capcom has lovingly recreated every historic location and moment you remember from 1998, and you owe it to yourself to witness that spectacle first-hand.Please note that some external links on this page are affiliate links, which means if you click them and make a purchase we may receive a small percentage of the sale.

Nowadays, he can be found playing the latest and greatest PS5 games as well as supporting Derby County. That last detail is his downfall.Comments (115)If anyone has any questions about my review or the game, feel free to copy me in!8/10 is my wait for a sale score. Looking good, can't wait to try it after I platinum spider-man and god of war @fluggy lol@fluggy Those are some seriously high standards! 8 is a very high score given to great games.@Jake3103 ... its a high ""good"" ... I prob wouldn't pay a £44.99 premium for ""good"" these days, given what I could get on PSN sales for that.I believe you're misremembering how the zapping system worked. Items stored in chests in the original by one character cannot be taken by the other. Certain decisions you made in the game as the first character you played affected the second character's playthrough (taking items from the armory in the basement, releasing the gas in the lab) but there absolutely was no item sharing.@fluggy it's ""Great"", not a ""high good""  it's also only £39.99 on Amazon at the mo.@Jake3103 games aren't cheap. if one chooses to only buy 9/10 or 10/10 games at launch, that is fair in my opinion. i don't even buy masterpiece games at launch myself as i consider $90 here in canada for ANY game to be a ridiculous price point. having said that, i have a feeling games are going to rise another $10 with the ps5 gen... something to look forward to! ""It’s disappointing that some of the original’s more outlandish creatures are nowhere to be seen, especially so when no new terrors have been thrown into the mix.""That's interesting, I did wonder how they'd handle some of the weirder creatures - the walking plants in particular. Turns out they just..didn't.@fluggy Fair enough.@Porco Nothing wrong with not spending the money on launch and waiting for a sale. I do it all the time. I'm just surprised that a game getting an 8 might be a potential turnoff for some people who seem like they were otherwise excited for the game. 8 is a great score. It's also sitting on a 91 aggregate rating right now.Kinda sucks that crows, spiders, etc are removed. Nowhere near a deal breaker though. Can’t wait to get it.@fluggyGreat standards. Apart from the odd competitive multiplayer, like movies I've positioned myself 1 year being the curve. As you can't miss what you haven't had. Plus it's cheap and usually patched to perfection.""Video games simply aren’t designed this way anymore, and despite a number of changes and refinements, gameplay is still going to feel a little too archaic for some. Inventory limits will continue to frustrate newcomers, the lack of any real story setup may disappoint those who were looking for further lore, and the short supply of bullets may leave some stuck in a rut.""Inventory limits and spare resources are an integral part of the genre's design, so this isn't a negative for me. Also good to hear that this is still primarily a gameplay-driven experience.I'm super excited to finally play this!""The short supply of bullets may leave some stuck in a rut.""Not if you do what I did in the demo and accidentally put the handgun in the storage crate. Then you don't need to worry about bullets at all""Gone are the spiders...""Honestly, thank god. I dreaded thinking about seeing the giant spiders in the RE engine. I get people will miss them, but I sure won't.@LiamCroft How creepy is the Lab compared to the rest of the game and did they keep its eerie music?I've never played RE2 and I'm a big girl when it comes to anything remotely scary or jumpy. I just about managed the zombies in the demo but hearing about Mr X chasing you really puts me off. I hate being chased in any game by something that relentlessly keeps on coming. It scares the life out of me.Lol ""inventory limits"" "" short supply of bullets"" maybe THOSE gamers would enjoy RE6.Well having just beaten the original Resi 2 over the weekend I can say I'm more than up for this ""archaic"" gameplay, sorry but that game is more interesting than many I've played this gen. I'm more than happy with having to put a bit of thought into managing my inventory and not having a near unlimited supply of ammo and not magically respawning exactly where I died, or riding a horse for 10 minutes to find anything interesting to do and if I never have to climb a tower to unlock icons on a map again I'll be a very happy man 😁My only concern is the lack of giant spiders and those plant things which is a shame but hopefully the giant alligator is still there. I'm also confused about the lack of lore, the original had plenty of story plus many files dotted about and the demo seemed to have these too so we'll see how that plays out. In any case I'm very much looking forward to playing this when it pops through my letterbox@Ralizah I thought this was a strange criticism too. I would've been disappointed if they'd removed these things. It's 'survival' horror. Not 'go in unlimited guns ablazing' horror.Good review. It sounds like a fantastic game. I thought it would be a 9 honestly. I think some of the criticisms are actually good things instead. Limited ammo is what gives the horror, inventory management expounds on that. I recently played Resi 6's Leon campaign on professional and it made for different and better game. The first part of the campaign carried a lot more tension and horror because I was always on brink of no ammo and couldn't fight some of the hordes thrown at me;I had to run. @LiamCroft So it sounds like It's more about picking a character than different campaigns? It sounds like you wouldn't miss out on much by only playing as Leon or vice versa, is that true?@Areus The lab is pretty creepy. Many floors are in darkness until you get the power back on, which then triggers many of the zombies lying on the floor to wake up. Plus there are the plant creatures, and Mr X appears down there.@Jaz007 Correct. Each character does have their own little exclusive sequence where you play as Ada or Sherry, but besides that, the two campaigns are very, very similar.I thought RE was dead after RE6, the smartest move they made was RE7 Biohazard bring the survival horror back brilliant game. So i am glad they've remade RE2 & cannot wait to play it especially with modern graphics.resident evil 2 classic.next up resident evil 3 nemesis.and capcom give me dragon dogma 2👍💗❤💞💕💖.word life.word is bond.word to your mother.word up sonIt looks incredible, I'm too much of a wimp to play it though.To the reviewer,does this have difficulty levels to choose from, like easy /medium/hard etc ?Very excited for this. Tempted to dust off the ps3 and play the original ps1 classic first. They really should make them ps1 classic games downloadable on the ps4. I'd buy loads more.Question @LiamCroft. How is the game music? Is it mostly the same, similar or completely different to Classic RE2? And do the save rooms still have that relaxing piano music?@Ralizah wholeheartedly agree and I think it's a shame that we don't have video games designed this anymore where you have to play with a bit of care and genuine apprehension of what you may come across and whether you are equipped to deal with itGreat score and I'm genuinely excited for this after playing the demo!I'm still a big scaredy cat (didn't finish RE7 LOL) but I think I can power through this one x)This is one of those games I'm glad I didn't play the original (since they removed some enemies) and I'm glad I can experience it first time!@fluggy Do you realise people like you are the reason review sites want to scrap scores on reviews.On the other hand Liam also gave Metal Gear Survive an 8 and there's no way I'm picking that up in a sale.@LiamCroft I have read in other reviews that there are ""B"" scenarios that you unlock for Claire and Leon by beating their respective ""A"" scenarios. Did you get to try either of those, and if you did, were they significantly different, i.e. offer different endings or weapons for either of them?Can't wait to try this, last year I played straight through RE4-7 and I've been waiting for this remake so I can start RE0 and RE1 and catchup on this classic series.Respect the review Disagree with it on every front though Imo It's a masterpiece didn't play entire entire game finished only A scenarios.This is one of those games where Right mix of nostalgia and Amazing modern Gameplay makes every thing perfect for me The game didn't need to be some groundbreaking horror Last of us lvl of storytelling the only thing this game needed to show me is what is like to be rookie cop and a lost girl in a city full of zombies a remake that should give you that vibe of loneliness in a city full of zombies.@hulkie Yes it does. Assisted, Standard, and Hardcore. Assisted has regenerating health, aim assist, and easier enemies. Hardcore only allows you to save via ink ribbons and no checkpoints.@RedMageLanakyn I've got an article explaining the differences coming at launch, but the A/B scenarios aren't as much as a thing as they were in the original. I played both Leon and Claire's standard campaigns, as well as what would be considered Claire's B route, all through to completion. There's a different character sequence exclusive to each campaign and different weapons, but besides that, the differences are very small.@LiamCroft Thank you ! Assisted sounds good to me. What about the Tofu mode, is it available from the start,or need to be unlocked?@hulkie It has to be unlocked. You need to finish the two campaigns and Hunk's scenario before you can play it.Honestly, I'll miss the 'thud thud thud' noise of those spiders in the sewers. I suppose it's even more scary when you can't see them because of the fixed camera angle of the original, though.@LiamCroft Thanks.Is there an easy mode like in REMake and 0 HD?I know beggers cant be choosers,but you know what would have made this game a 10/10?They should have thrown in for free the original ps 1 version of part 2 in a bonus section menu. No graphical upgrades,maybe just slightly uprezzed to look like it does on ps3.@DualWielding Lol. Just a few posts earlier I asked,wont take long to find. And,yes it does.Im assuming the demo we got was on medium difficulty.@LiamCroft Gotcha, thank you for the response and the excellent review!I’m waiting for my copy to arrive, it will be the first time that I will play Resident Evil 2.I modified my PSOne to play NTSC games just for Resi 2, back in the days.It is one of my fondest memories for a series of reasons, not all game related.That said, i didn’t care that much for this remake until i read “no spiders”.I may now reconsider.Great review and so glad to see it got a high score too!This is my most anticipated game of the year as I absolutely LOVED this game back in the day.I'm really disappointed to hear they took out the Spiders though..real shame.And I'm pretty sure both campaigns were very different in the original from what I remember so hearing they are very similar just with different characters is also a bit of a let down but all in all,after playing the demo i can't wait to play this on friday!Inventory limits and a lack of ammo aren’t negative points, they’re the foundations of survival horror games! Good to know it’s sticking to what it does best. The new graphics and darker tone just wouldn’t suit the spiders and such.Never played the original, but I was always confused about the whole ""A"" Campaign, ""B"" Campaign thing. Is it true that this remake does away with that and goes RE1 style? As in, there's just a ""Leon"" campaign and a ""Claire"" campaign (before unlocks, of course)?Review definitely has me interested in playing, but sadly will probably wait for a $25 sale during Black Friday.KH3 will be having my attention for awhile, then DMC 5 in March etc.‘You’ve got Redfield on you’ 😀😀. Very good 👍Amazing work, at 91 Metacritic. The demo was fantastic.That said, I have Ace Combat 7 and will be getting Kingdom Hearts 3 on day 1 so not picking it up myself.@TalentedGamer Wouldnt waste time on a 6.@3MonthBeef ... Ridiculous i'd rather spend my money on a 9 or 10 than an 8?? ... That seems illogical?@fluggy why do you need someone else's score to determine if you would like the game or not? Why take 1 review from push□ To make your mind up?. Go on gamerankings.com, check out the average and read all the reviews before making your mind up. You might play it for yourself and decide, to you it's worthy of a 10/10.If I made my purchases based on other people's reviews I'd have missed some cracking games in my years.... im not missing it ... i'm choosing to not pay £44.99. I'll get it eventually. Last game I bought on release was God of War. Thats the kind of quality that I pay top dollar for. Anything less, I wait a couple of months. Thanks for your concern though ... im deeply touched.I wonder how Will Smith feels about being dropped from the original?@fluggy lmao what? Are you for real?@kyleforrester87 The plants are apparently in.@fluggy I'd give the quality of your sarcasm 8/10. Defenately not worth ""top dollar""It's really, really good. I've been playing it and having an absolute blast.I just bought a 3ds (yes, I'm 8 years late lol) and I have a massive backlog (Arkham series, KH 1.5+2.5, Prey, Dishonored 1 + 2, MGSVTPP, etc.) so I won't get this now. Definitely going to get at some point though when it's on sale. This style of RE looks way more interesting to me than RE7, maybe that's because I'm a baby lol.If I'm reading this right, you want the archaic chest inventory system back in, but lament the inclusion of archaic mechanics like limited inventory and limited ammunition.I've read a handful of reviews and it seems general consensus is it's a new school game with a very old school feel which is exactly what I got from playing the 1-shot demo. I enjoyed the mechanics and the very welcome modern controls and the police station was beautifully updated. If the rest of the game has as much care put into it (and it seems it does) I'm going to be hooked on this like I was 21 years ago. Looking forward to Friday.worst review ever read@Lekzie1 There it is, thanks!well there is just no keeping up is there with all these great games coming out i still haven't even started spiderman.@carlos82 Lol you always have to slide your dislike for RDR2 or Ubisoft games in your comments. You like linear games, fine, people prefer open worlds too. RDR2 and Witcher 3 will remain the best games this gen for a while until something crazy comes out, obviously it's getting harder for linear games to compete.@fluggy nah matey! 8 out of 10 is still good are you kidding me! Otherwise I’d never play good games(?) like vampr.... however you spell it, darksiders 3, maybe even hitman 2 and the latest tomb raider game......@Lekzie1 Judging by the quality of that sentence, you're not really in a position to criticize.Someone should compile a list of good games rated 7 out of ten (or 70 out of 100) just to show people what they are missing and to trust that 7 out of ten is still good. (8 great, 9 fantastic and amazing, 10 is perfect yes?@Kiloman74 ... thats EXACTLY what I said ... 8/10 is ""good"".... with so many top tier games available, why would I spend my money on ""good"" games when I can spend the same amount on ""exceptional"" games. Vampyr, DSiders and latest Tomb Raider were all subpar. . . and thats being kind.@PS_Nation same here! 👍✌️@SegaBlueSky game got an 8 cuz its not a rockstar game? the sheer amount of detail alone and the zombie physics and ai sets it apart from other games.@Lekzie1 Horses for courses. There are plenty of highly-rated games I don't enjoy too, like Rockstar and Bethesda's games. But Push Square aren't the only ones to give Resident Evil 2 an 8 and there's nothing wrong with that score. They think it's great, in fact. From what I can see the (few) criticisms they have are perfectly valid.@SegaBlueSky thats the point gow 2018 got a lot of flaws still didnt got an 8 here anyway im expectin days gone will get a lower than 8 here cuz lets be honest theres no way its near as close as re2 when it comes to a zombie game@TheArt only as much as you profess your love for open worlds and RDR2, plus I really like The Witcher 3 (it might even be my favourite PS4 game) and some other open world games too including the first Red Dead Redemption, though too many recently feel too similar to one another. Oh and tell God of War it's getting hard for linear games to compete 😉@Lekzie1 Which again, is down to opinion. If you read Push Square's GOW review, I don't think it mentions a single flaw, hence the 10/10 score.However I do agree, personally for me RE2 is a far more enticing prospect than Days Gone. But I don't need a review to tell me that and the score doesn't change that opinion, because they're very different games and I know which one appeals to me. It may be that whoever reviews Days Gone thinks it's the best game they've ever played. We'll have to see.@KingdomHeartsFan You'd think everyone would realize that by now, wouldn't you? But gamers be gamers.@SegaBlueSky yeah I know, gow got a lot of flaws but still manage to get a 10 while this game few minor quirks really affect the verdict, even though we all know that this is the ultimate survival horror experience at least on the technical side.@carlos82 God of War was too short for me, with like 5 characters in the entire game. Those 2 boring blacksmith brothers spawning anywhere anytime felt fake- yea they claim they have some dwarven teleportation skills but c'mon. The game is fine but definitely not better than RDR2. Oh and I did play it with a neutral mindset hoping to get blown away, which I was a bit but it came to an end real quick. I think I might just prefer Horizon even. A Frostclaw or a common Thunderjaw would give any GOW Troll a run for their money. You're gripped with fear when confronting a Fireclaw in the Frozen Wilds.@TheArt It's all subjective. RDR2 just isn't my cup of tea, for example, and I find that with most (not all, but most) open world games. But loved GoW and had what I'd consider a very good amount of time with it for an action game, at least 20-30 hours probably? Definitely game of the year in my books, absolutely loved it and was gripped from start to finish.@SegaBlueSky Yes it's all subjective and when I see anyone constantly trying to bash something, I just gotta chip in to remind them their favorite game isn't too special either.@TheArt strange as to me isd flip it. GOW imo was much better than RDR2. I found it a boring slog in the final 2 chapters and the 2 prologue chapters nearly made me give up.@TheArt actually they were a bit annoying, even more so when the boy upsets one of them so he just whines all the time. Horizon Zero Dawn is amazing, not so much the side stuff but that combat is exceptional with plenty of options when a few different types mix together. Not played the DLC but I won't forget my battles with a Thunderjaw in a hurry@carlos82 id love to get in to this game but i just cant. Ive owned it twice betore but just didnt click with it. Got as far as where you have to go and kill the giant sabre tooth tiger looking thing.@Kidfunkadelic83 yeah I can see why people can't having replayed it recently, I just had a lot of fun beating up the robot dinosaurs and when you get to the bigger ones that combat really starts to shine. I couldn't begin to tell you what is happening in the story though.@carlos82 i think that is the problem with me. I have a big back log of games so a game needs to grip me within a few hours or i just lose interest. The ammount of amazing games i have that i stop playing to try out the ""new"" game that i dont go back to is crazy. I rarely manage to complete a game. Spiderman and GOW was the last games I finninshed which is why I rate both highly as they kept me engrossed enough to complete them.@Kidfunkadelic83 I'm in a similar situation but more due to a lack of time to play in the first place and have many unfinished games that I'll likely not return to. Which probably contributes to my frustrations at those games which don't respect that time.@Kidfunkadelic83 Ok but is it because it's slow-paced? Are you hyped for RE2? Because it's also slow-paced which is fine by me.@carlos82 The Frozen Wilds is brutal! Horizon is innovative - shooting components off machines is really satisfying. Trolls in GOW can be found in just about any game, dodge a blow, get behind and chip on the legs, same MO every time.@TheArt cant say I'm really hyped for resi 2 as I hate anything remotely scary. I physically can't play them 😂I did however play the demo and really liked it butvi think the inclusion of Mr X chasing me down tight hall ways would Finnish me off. I'm a big girls blouse 😂@Kidfunkadelic83 😂 I know. It's like I'd prefer Uncharted to the Last of Us not because one is better than the other but I prefer to relax and enjoy games rather than being tensed up all the time sitting at the edge of my seat.The last of us doesn't bother me but anything more than that and I can't play it.I've tried for years to overcome my fear of playing creepy games and I just can't do it.Shopto emailed me earlier to confirm mines been dispatched. 50/50 chance its coming tomorrow. EEk!!!!!@Porco Yeah there is one massive flaw in that reasoning. You can miss the biggest gems if you look that way.@carlos82 Well im so far in Horizon Zero Dawn i will finish that before i can start the Resident Evil 2 Remake and that game is one of my favorites. Horizon Zero Dawn i thought i would drop it but the i started with the main missions and im all back 70 hours plus already. 😃😃😃😃😃😃😃@TheArt Did you love RDR 1? I found that game so boring more gameplay doesnt always make it better. 😁I would rate Heavenly Sword with 6 hours way higher. Fantastic story, characters and that ending. 😭😭@fluggy Completely disagree with you on that point. Some big games get a too big pass RDR2 is one of those. Plus ratings are a opinion a lot of the times.@playstation1995 Clock Tower and Haunting Grounds please. 😁Breath of Fire please i loved 3 and 4.😃@Flaming_Kaiser Safe to say you're just not a fan of Rockstar's games right. What games do you like, what games do you rate highest this gen? Because seems to me you don't like all the popular games.might pick this up at this rate!i never was into resident evil but after hearing so many good things from the 2 remakes and having checked out 7 at youtube and loving the whole vibe i might aswell get into this series now.next stop would be a resi 3 remake which has been rumored to be planned right?@Flaming_Kaiser i'm not missing any gems... i just pick them up 12-24 months after they release is all.@TheArt My last Rockstar game what was last Vice City or Manhunt? I dont count RDR because it was so boring i did not finish it and sold it. 😃@TheArt Horizon i love that game so much. The story i love it but the combat shines like nothing else around.GOW, Bloodborne, Dragon Quest Builders why does part 2 take so long too release.Valkyria Chronicles Remaster and 4, Injustice 2 one of the best fighters this generation. Dynasty Warriors 4 Orochi i played that so long.I have a lot of games i want to start Spiderman, Dragon Quest 11, RE7 and all the remasters no Resident Evil 6 that garbage does not exist to me.And i need to start so much RPG's and i played a lot of great indies. Yet i dont seem to get so much time for games any more new job nightshifts its killing me slowly. 😔@Flaming_Kaiser I like all the games you mentioned, games are so good nowadays it's hard to not like them. The industry has come a long way, but of course you're going to have favourites and criticize constructively your least favourites.Yes I finished RDR1 multiple times to 100%, bought it 2 times for PS3 & Xbox 360, bought San Andreas 3 times(you can make that 4 since I have it on my PS4 too) , GTAIV 2 times, and of course bought GTAV 2 times too so yea, I'm a Rockstar Games big fan.@Flaming_Kaiser Yea Horizon is so unique and innovative. I bought it so late in the middle of 2018 because like several other people, I didn't get the robot dinosaur concept being shot at with arrows. Now, it's one of my favourites of all time. The combat is different, challenging and satisfying. The sound design is crazy, you get chills when you hear the steps of a Sawtooth early on. The Tramplers, Storm birds, Fireclaws all give you the shake. Not once was I terrified in GOW, the trolls looked like colorful huge teddy bears that just came out to play.Man some of yall need to get a life. This review doesn't warrant a back a forth paragraph long responses on what you dislike or like about other games & what they did for you personally compared to what other games failed to do for you ""subjectively"". It's not that deep, grow the hell up...@fluggy why? 8 out of ten is good going on very good, 9 would be absolutely amazing! You missing out on a lot of good/very good games!@antdickens so stop fussing and don’t worry! You will get your moneys worth and will enjoy yourself! I’ve never played resi 2 and 3! Give number 3 the same treatment and pitthat game back on the gaming map, no one talks about resi evil nemesis hardly.......@fluggy ok. But what’s wrong with a “good game? No game is perfect. I was stupid enough to buy the Deadpool remaster for PS4 yet I’m enjoying a non good game? What about dragon quest 11. If that were only just “good” would it put me off buying that game? Hell no! Yakuza games are good going on excellent! Gravity rush 1&2 just good? So not buying? Fist of the North Star? Man, I’m glad I ain’t you..... lol kidding.My physical copy just came through the door a day before release. Can't wait to play it later It's actually pretty good, the atmosphere and everything, still there will be people complaining about some things....but i think Capcom could have added a 'fixed' camera option like in the original game.That could have been nice, if not, original to say least.Was having higher expectations for the game scoring 8/10 its not an essential purchase.@fluggy I'm with you 100% it needs to be amazing for full price. PSN sales are perfect for catching up on the rest...
