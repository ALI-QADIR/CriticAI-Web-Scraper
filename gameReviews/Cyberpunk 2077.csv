Cyberpunk 2077,Chris Tapsell,Eurogamer,https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-12-10-cyberpunk-2077-review-intoxicating-potential-half-undermined-half-met,"Finite City.It's been a little over eight and a half years since Cyberpunk 2077 was announced. For the majority of the time, developer-publisher CD Projekt told us we could expect it when it's ready, and not a moment sooner. Unfortunately, it isn't. Cyberpunk 2077 has finally arrived, thunderous and yellow, after months of reported 'death march' crunch - enforced overtime extended repeatedly to shifting deadlines - and sadly it shows. Even putting the human cost aside, it is an enormous shame. As much as the excitement has been at times irresponsibly over-fanned, Cyberpunk 2077 is a game of vast ambition. It's driven by a core of characters wonderfully written and performed, a story of genuine layer, momentum and depth, a technical feat of immersive decision-making, and pumping, sim-inspired action. But the undeniable potential is drowning under the tidal wave of little issues. An uncharacteristic carelessness to the finer points, some pervasive immaturity of thought, and distracting, recurring bugs leave Cyberpunk 2077 as a game in conflict: a world of unmatched detail, in dire need of attention. But how I love it, nonetheless. Cyberpunk 2077 follows CD Projekt's trend for adapting its games from the grittier kinds of genre fiction. As The Witcher games drew heavily from Andrzej Sapkowski's Polish fantasy novels, Cyberpunk 2077 does from Mike Pondsmith's Cyberpunk, a 1988 tabletop RPG. The result is a strong emphasis on immersion at all costs, a slightly of-its-time tone, and far greater choice in what you can do and how you can do it than in any of the studio's previous games.You play as V, starting with a choice between three 'life paths' that dictate your background and what happens to you in the first four or five hours of the game, as well as providing you with occasional life path-specific dialogue prompts throughout. It's a neat idea, but the real consequence of it is hard to tell - for me, playing V as a woman with a 'Corpo' life path, it served as a fun jump-off for some very light, conversational role-playing as a once-vicious power broker now fallen from grace (think Luv, of Blade Runner 2049, if Wallace gave her the boot), but that was about it. The role-playing is focused, sticking to depth of choice through your personality, your decisions, and your plan of attack, but notably not the breadth of things to do - no guilds or playstyle-specific pseudo main-quest stories like those of The Elder Scrolls, or an MMO.You also begin with a deep, if somewhat overcompensating character creator. The customisation is equal parts fantastic and ridiculous, and a good look at CD Projekt's conflicted approach in microcosm. There are wonderful, microscopic details to hair and fingernails and scarring - and also half a dozen penis options, choices for breast size and the diameter of your areola. There are just the two genders, mind, and, in the game's words, the pronouns people will use for you in-game are dictated by your voice - an oddly prudish and self-defeating decision, that's clumsy at best and sits at odds with the world itself, making for one where everyone can modify their limbs and eyeballs and sub-dermalogica membrane at will, but god forbid anything else.The world CD Projekt has sought to create with Cyberpunk 2077 is everything, of course. Few games in my memory have sparked such intense and interesting discussion of genre, and in cyberpunk dystopia is inseparable from the genre itself. And what a beast Cyberpunk 2077's dystopia is. Night City is a monster. A putrid, monolithic, contemptible, shrieking hellhole and monument to maximalism, the temptation is to view it in isolation as just that: a horrible world created as a kind of hyped-up, GTA-style pastiche (and there is a lot of GTA here), lampooning somewhat accurately but also peevishly, the kind where everyone's the target and easy nihilism is the goal, sporadic and facile. It doesn't exist in isolation though, far from it. Night City is Cyberpunk 2077's nemesis, your character's foil. It goes beyond the easy parodies, the insufferable talking heads, the insipid advertising boards. The sounds are masterfully aligned: humming neon, buzzing flies, whirring motors, screeching horns, yelling passers-by. In missions it's the same, the world tinged in perennial high-alert red, with a piercingly shrill noise that sounds every time you're even half spotted, or clip the wrong pedestrian on another chaotic ride. Cyberpunk 2077 might have GTA's five star 'wanted' system, but it doesn't work the same - you're obliterated in an instant when you get to four - and it might have denser crowds, in some places, but they're even more hateful here. The point of it is its hostility. Night City's an unlivable, unbearable place where you feel relentlessly watched and on-edge, where V, performed with superlative nuance by Cherami Leigh, can barely keep it together. I'm reminded of a deeply sensitive moment that will stay with me for some time, where the story leads V to a brothel in search of a lead and, given the uneven tone, you brace for the sordid. Instead, what followed was a moment of intense intimacy, a conversation that picked V apart, dismantling her paper-thin guard, even as she knows it's this person's job to do that, that there's no sincerity to the words at all. You end up lying, foetal and afraid, on the bed in this womb-pink booth, looking through the eyes of a character now deconstructed and absurd. ""Don't make me go back out there,"" she says, and I don't want to either.In fact, everyone in Cyberpunk 2077 is barely keeping it together. The plot is some straight-up Paul Verhoeven - late '80s edge, future dystopia, gore - and through the cloud of guts and technobabble it sizzles and cracks with raucous momentum. It's paced impeccably, balancing the techno-action-crime-thriller narrative with an uncanny ability to slow things down. There's a narrative game buried in Cyberpunk 2077's noise in fact, as it becomes clearer with each lengthy, intimate conversation between the carnage. Where other games of its kind would give you a minute or less for the perfunctory heart-to-heart, Cyberpunk gives you hours, talking over childhood and life as you stake out some joint for a heist. Talking belonging and personhood and the homeliness of love in the desert. Talking identity with yourself, Keanu Reeves cast ingeniously against type as an atomic arsehole stuffed into the back of your head, loveable and vile.So much energy has been directed at the question of Cyberpunk 2077's parable. Of what it says. It says nothing. What matters is not what it tells you but what it offers up for you to find, what it is about. What it is about is total, human fear; of alienation in every form; the all-consumptive terror of human life in the inhuman world. V is cast adrift, gasping, floundering, her intense vulnerability and that of the tragic, beautifully crafted characters she meets set against the most invulnerable enemy. It asks the more typical sci-fi questions of humanity and identity and purpose, too, to mixed success, but crucially without hard answers. In other words: it does its job. Like all great stories, Cyberpunk 2077's requires you to put something of yourself into it to mine the depths, not simply look at the surface and read the message off.Cyberpunk 2077 is not just a narrative game, of course. Maybe it's worse off for that, but there are other places where it shines almost as bright. Combat itself is simple, almost alarmingly so. Blades are more or less quick attack, block, or heavy attack, for instance, like Skyrim with a hand behind your back - and it's utterly chaotic. But it's fun, fluid, ridiculous, after you desensitize yourself to the puerility of the gore. After a long while, the guns do warm up to the more excessive kind that Cyberpunk 2077's tone requires, and the stealth and hacking aren't full immersive sim stuff - the depth of physics just isn't there - but they are varied, and the sandbox full of toys. Where it's elevated is the systems that work behind the scenes. You can play it stealthily ( and entirely non-lethally, I think); you can play it as just a 'netrunner', hacking enemies into spontaneous combustion and taking over the contraptions around them; you can go in violently, which is the easiest and most varied. Blades, blunts, fists, pistols, assault weapons, shotguns and heavy LMGs all have their own sub-skill trees, as do the different sides of hacking and skulking and crafting, too. There's good depth to how these all tie together: you can modify your body with cybernetics, which can set you up for enjoyable feedback loops on your cooldowns and capacities. You can craft new weapons and outfits and new mods for enhancing those. You can grind for specific perks - your progress half-tied to how often you use a certain playstyle, half to overall level - which again feed back into the loop of all the other things at work. You can plan and strategize these builds forever, and replay again with something that feels very different.This is also where Cyberpunk 2077 really stumbles, and keeps on stumbling from there. I finished the entire story, plus a handful of sidequests, with just one cybernetic installed out of scores of options, after crafting just one or two guns to see how it worked, after barely half-upgrading one of the near-dozen skill trees. It's possible to glide through Cyberpunk 2077 easily, without ever scratching the surface of its systems, and while that sounds like a selling point I don't think it is. It's poorly signposted, poorly breadcrumbed, poorly paced, above all. You get the most XP for completing main story quests, but I was genuinely too low-level to unlock anything good by the time I was done. Even going back after the end to drink in more of the world and dive into the side activities, the sense is still that most of the game's interesting mechanics are blocked off, behind massive piles of money, experience, and time. If you have to blast through almost everything the game has to offer before you can actually play it at its potential, something's gone wrong.The impression here is a lack of care - maybe a lack of time to give it care - and it persists. Driving for instance is pretty poor, with motorbikes' turning circles like trucks and again just the little things missing. Notice in GTA how, at high speeds, the minimap zooms out, giving you a view of where you'll need to turn up ahead. In Cyberpunk 2077 you're past the turning before you know it's there.The UI, in particular the world map, is dreadful. Across the blood-red smear are hundreds upon hundreds of exclamation marks. Some of them are for missions you've received, some of them aren't - there's no way to tell without hovering over each one, and so there's no at-a-glance readability to the world. You can't plan your exploration in any meaningful way, and so you end up relying on just completing the missions you already have. And those will, inevitably, come via your phone. How I longed to tear that cursed device from the back of V's head and toss it into the sea. Your smartphone is your hub. People will call and text you, ceaselessly, with cars for you to buy, welcome messages to new regions, conversational texts (often touching and funny but swallowed amid all the rest), new jobs, updates on inactive jobs you're not tracking, interruptions, buggily, to conversations you're already having, an AI chauffeur yelling about its latest runaway wagon while another buddy dies in your arms. This is Cyberpunk 2077's final scourge. Bugs persist, slightly reduced after a patch but nowhere close to squashed. It feels cruel to linger on them too much, but they're topped by a persistent animation bug that's plagued my entire playthrough, and those of others I know to have played it too. Characters get caught in idle animations, while scenes of death and melodrama are repeatedly undermined by someone skidding about and pirouetting like a giant chess piece on ice, which is a devastating shame. There are more, and fixes are ongoing, but the point remains that Cyberpunk 2077 is a game that can feel very close to falling apart. It's immersion-breaking, in a game where immersion is absolutely paramount.Honestly, it's a dilemma. Technical issues are often passing, but what lingers is the lack of readiness, in the wider sense. The lack of requisite care. The story is a marvel, as is the sheer, red mist hostility of the world that houses it. The promised depth of systems are there, but mishandled. The maturity - and recall CD Projekt describing Cyberpunk, on announcement, as ""a mature RPG for a mature audience"" - is often not. Maturity in the immature sense, maybe: the teenage idea of it, that 'maturity' equals Rated M and can be found in nakedness, coarseness, blood and guts, when in actuality it's closer to something like the forced perspective gained from time. My lingering impression of Cyberpunk 2077 is of a game that's shouting over itself, relentlessly at odds with its own creative voice. Amidst it all, the nuance that does exist in Cyberpunk 2077, the intense, intoxicating humanity at its heart, is so nearly engulfed by all the noise. But I think I can still hear it, just about.You're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!

Our experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you. Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware.We received a 50GB patch during our review period. CDPR referred to this patch as the Day 0 patch. When asked for clarification whether the patch will be what players were receiving at launch, a CDPR representative told us that the Day 0 patch is what people will be experiencing on launch day. It is the Day 1 patch, only different in name. More fixes will be rolled into the Day 0 (Day 1) patch, but we cannot specify exactly what. I'm on an aimless walking tour of Night City. Somehow I've ended up in the Japantown neighborhood's Arasaka-financed streets, where animated billboards for ""Sweet Clean Speed"" and pornographic braindances climb the flanks of utilitarian skyscrapers, blotting out the stars with a rainbow of neon. I pass a ramen shop, a hot dog stand, and a man selling spice, piles of garbage tucked beneath the offramp behind him. A mob of Christians gather at a nearby intersection, waving signs and screaming ""Blasphemers!"" at the cops. A voice makes booming proclamations in Japanese from loudspeakers overhead, flying cars crisscrossing the invisible roads between buildings. The sky glows with light pollution, but the moon is full and clear. It's a beautiful night. I just left Judy Alvarez's place. My friend's been through a lot lately. Someone close to her has been victim to a string of horrors including sexual assault, physical trauma, and suicidal tendencies. We had a big heart-to-heart about it, undermined by the presence of elaborate arm-knife crosshairs fixed on her forehead even though I put my arm-knives away earlier (I'm polite like that). There was also the notification from that fancy sniper rifle I picked up 20 minutes ago, still notifying me that I picked up a sniper rifle. Duly noted, notification.But hey, Judy's not perfect either. I've seen her clip through chairs and float across the room while confessing something deeply personal. And yet, I am duty bound to stick through the bugs for my friend. I genuinely care about her. She's on my mind while I continue my walk through Night City. Ahead, a streetlamp floats in the air, its base failing to load. A busker plays an invisible guitar. The facade of a skyscraper flickers briefly. Something ain't right, so I call my car and it arrives in classic Roach style, driving through a concrete barrier, screeching to a halt. As I approach, a van spawns in the same space and the two vehicles fight to exist before my taxi spurts out and knocks me to the ground. Should I call Judy, see if she's hanging in there?It's just another day in Cyberpunk 2077, a pretty good RPG in an amazing setting absolutely sick with bugs. There won't be another open world like this for a long, long time. I love wandering the mountains of trash on the outskirts of town, cutting pretty silhouettes from a distance. Up close, well, it's trash. And sometimes the smog gets so thick around the old Arasaka memorial downtown you can't see the tops of buildings, everything washed in dirty orange light. I watched traffic here for a while, employees of the corporate world hurrying to and fro all around me. What is it? An open world action RPG set in the near future.

Release date: Here's when Cyberpunk 2077 unlocks by timezone (opens in new tab)Then there's the Biotechnica farm: A city of tents stretching into the horizon, swarms of transport vehicles buzzing to and fro tending to their synthetic protein flowers. From here, Night City looks as small as a city in a snow globe. And you can just walk there. The scale and density is mind boggling, every area clearly touched by countless artists and neatly embedded into the history and logistics of Night City. Take a microscope to it and you'll see the seams instantly. NPCs are aimless automatons or carefully posed puppets. I've seen the same guy, at least his shape, splayed out on a couch playing guitar all over the city. I made the mistake of stopping to inspect a roadside rave in the Badlands, only to realize there were three sets of triplets in attendance. Sometimes far off textures load in a touch too late, or the five o'clock rush hour snaps into existence in front of your eyes. Night City is a stage, not a simulation. But if you stay moving and keep your eyes trained ahead, every frame is a striking, lively scene. Night City is nearly unparalleled at middle to long distances, joining the best of PC gaming's open worlds, which include Red Dead Redemption 2's American west and Grand Theft Auto 5's Los Santos. Rockstar's been matched. I'd pay full price just to walk around and take photos forever, my senses perpetually drunk. It's an incredible work that the stories within never quite measure up to. The variety of citizens in Night City is remarkable (opens in new tab), with outrageous future fashions, wild hairstyles, and elaborate cyber implants. You'll see rodeo cowboys with mechanical legs, tattooed yakuza, faces crisscrossed with cyberware, '80s metalheads sporting wraparound neon visors, and people so heavily augmented you'll wonder if there's any human left. There's a real sense of this being a teeming, vibrant metropolis with layers of history and culture. And everyone just looks cool as hell.Cyberpunk's main quest storyline is full of interesting ideas, but marred by inconsistent characterization and focus. Johnny Sliverhand, played by a grumpy Keanu Reeves, and you, a merc for hire and fully-voiced character named V, are centerstage. As V, you're an accidental witness to a top level corporate assassination and forced to work with Johnny, not only to expose the truth, but to save V's life. Early on, due to a series of unfortunate events, a backup of Johnny Silverhand's consciousness ends up in V's head and begins to slowly take over his mind, effectively overwriting V. The effect Johnny has on V, and the equal and potentially opposite or compounding effect V has on Johnny is the heart of the RPG decision-making here. Johnny is a repulsive, crude, misogynist. And you can change that, assuming he doesn't swing you his way first, nevermind all the fixers, friends, and corporations pulling you every other direction. I had no clue whether to take my special pills to suppress the maniac in my head or to try and change him, the ambiguous and agonizing choice I want in an RPG. The blinders are on the whole time and nearly every decision is a leap of faith that hangs on your ideals, or at least the ideas of the character you're roleplaying. I just wish Johnny's characterization were more consistent. While I'd make major progressions in our relationship in the main quest, he'd regularly revert to the same old dickhead Johnny in a sidequest or the odd commentary impressively scattered throughout the entirety of Night City. I became friends with a sentient, autonomous taxicab operation—like, a whole-ass business. Too often what he has to say in these optional interactions is one note: Rockerboy trash talk, ego and narcissistic idealism personified, like an anarchy tag on an interstate Starbucks come to life. Keanu's mad, monotone performance doesn't help highlight the nuance either. While I loved where our relationship eventually ended up, I felt like Cyberpunk 2077 didn't really show me the work it took to get there. As a basic, adaptable foil for V, Johnny is a nice engine for introspection. Capitalism is bad, for sure, but Cyberpunk isn't interested in solving that problem. Cyberpunk instead asks why we choose to live within such a monstrous system, and I deeply appreciate the spotlight on V, the people in his life, and how they persist (or don't) in the muck. Yeah, the story is wrapped up in espionage, sabotage, and conspiracy at the highest order with a heaping side of corporate satire. But it's driven by V's basic human motivations. He doesn't want to die (I played as a man), he doesn't want to lose his consciousness to Johnny, and he wants to make something of himself. Those are the stakes V begins with, and depending on who you meet, what you learn about Johnny's past as a rockstar terrorist, and who you want to roleplay, the stakes change in major ways. Cyberpunk 2077 lifepaths: Which to choose

I fell in love with a nomad and took on the personal mission to become a reformed Corpo dorko, dreams of getting out of the city and living a simpler life. Permaculture is easy when your arms are knives. And, to my surprise, Cyberpunk supported an eerily appropriate arc for me, not one-to-one, but a testament to the sprawling narrative choices laid out under the skin. I know there are at least three endings (I chose mine after 10 minutes of staring at the screen, frozen), and that there are definitely more depending on who you befriend and/or romance. These aren't poorly compressed slideshow epilogues either, but hour-long endeavors, the kind of resplendent, explosive, dramatic stuff most big studios struggle to make one of. And I wouldn't have seen any of it if I'd skipped out on the side missions, a few of which are still left unfinished at the end of my 50-hour playthrough. While entirely optional, seeing through every side character's story to the end can fundamentally change how the larger story wraps. I spent a long time with Panam, a perky, stubborn nomad vying for respect among her peers. She deserved a chance. I also spent days deeply investigating Johnny's tragic past. I befriended a beat cop trying to stick to his morals in a clearly fixed game, hunting down a serial killer using surreal, invasive means in what might be my favorite quest of them all. Through a delightful series of misadventures I became friends with a sentient, autonomous taxicab operation—like, a whole-ass business. The deeper sidequests are infrequent, too difficult to separate from the endless warehouse infiltration Gigs, but they're all good to great, and some are up there with CD Projekt's best, even if there's no clear Bloody Baron standout. Too bad almost every serious dramatic beat was undercut by some kind of bug, ranging from a UI crowded by notifications and crosshairs failing to disappear, to full-on scripting errors halting otherwise rad action scenes. What should've been my favorite main quest venture, a thrilling infiltration mission set in a crowded public event, was ruined by two broken elevators. I had to reload a few times to get them working.The most absurd bug might've been when some children spawned in front of a timed shooting contest I entered with a friendly nomad. I couldn't shoot anywhere near the children because my weapon automatically raised, so I just sat there and let the timer run out as my buddy talked shit.More often the bugs are audiovisual tics, like the sound of a car loudly peeling out wailing on during a long drive as passenger with an NPC, a character passing through solid elevator doors, or a copy of Johnny's cigarette hanging in the air in front of me while he smokes another and goes on about what a coward I am. They're the kind of thing I can squint through here and there, but there wasn't a single quest in which something wacky didn't happen. Even the final scene in the closing moments of my ending featured cars spawning in the direct path of an NPC-driven vehicle. A nice, poignant drive and conversation seasoned with a head-on collision visible only to me. Even after installing the Day 0 patch, Night City still feels like it's barely holding together at times. The good news is that all this stuff can be fixed, but it also means the ideal Cyberpunk 2077 is delayed again, in spirit. Fallout: New Vegas was a mess at launch too, and smoothed out over time. Red Dead Redemption 2 was plagued by unforeseen issues with certain GPU and CPU combinations at the start. All good now. Bugs are a guarantee in games this big, but after 8 years in development and multiple delays, I hoped Cyberpunk 2077 would go down much smoother than this. With so many clothes to choose from, fashion (and buying cars) basically becomes the Cyberpunk endgame. Just be prepared to give up some armor and stat bonuses to wear what you like. The action holds together well enough, an FPS charcuterie board featuring some familiar Deus Ex stealth and hacking systems alongside the snappy ADS gunplay Call of Duty made standard. Weapons and armor have unique stats, though it's all pretty easily reduced to how much damage you can do and withstand versus the level of the enemies you're facing—the rest, including fashion, is left to preference. It's exciting stuff in the early hours, all those stats and weapons laid out before you, but the bottom drops out pretty quickly. Night City is stuffed with warehouses, armories, and secret labs to sneak into, most often via jobs a neighborhood fixer sets you up with. Infiltrate and kill a guy, rescue a prisoner, steal some data—the objectives bleed together quickly because the means tend to repeat too, at least if you're locked into a playstyle. I wanted to be a cyber ninja at first, using quickhacks to turn off cameras, destroy turrets, and blind my enemies before moving in with my katana and hacking them to bits. Things went well for a while, but pouring all my experience and perk points into blades made me nearly unkillable and my enemies as soft as Vienna sausage within a few hours. I like that my armor increases when I sprint, and that perfectly timed dodges initiate a short bout of slow-motion. I just don't think that beheading 10 men a minute should ever feel so simple and carefree. Even if I take it slow, and I did for around 10 hours, enemy AI is disappointingly rote. Stealth is a game of vision cones and patrol routes, with nearly no meaningful distinctions between gangs and corporations. I got so bored of sneaking around that I specced into more aggressive quickhacks, including one that set off a poisonous chain reaction between nearby goons, and rolled some pistols into my regimine. Now I slide into the room in slow motion, activating my favorite pistol ability, and headshot a few grunts before I even come to a stop. I clean up those that haven't choked on gas with my arm knives, snipping limbs off like paper dolls. It's rad as hell, but I'm just showing off for the sake of it, not because Cyberpunk is encouraging me to use every tool in the box.Combat and infiltration sadly depend too much on player showmanship, never pressing you to make tactical decisions in the thick of it, and worse, never prodding you to make meaningful decisions about where to pour your points. There's a ton of variety with potential for creative hybrid builds, from a barefisted gorilla hacker V to a loud gun-toting pacifist that walks and talks like Rambo but installs non-lethal mods on every weapon. I’m taken by how relentlessly hopeful Cyberpunk is.The gunplay feels great too: each gun treated with extravagant viewmodels, and adorned slick firing, idle, and reload animations. Heads pop and limbs dissolve, shotguns knock enemies on their cyberbutts—CD Projekt knows what bullets do, and it shows. For the quieter players looking for some Deus Ex, there's always a cleverly hidden sewer grate or balcony door to discover. But without any meaningful variations on enemy or level design after the first few hours, Cyberpunk is missing the incentive to experiment with it all. Luckily, most of my time in Cyberpunk has been at a languid pace, spent chatting with friends and criminals, outlaws and AIs, or going on impromptu walking tours around a neighborhood I somehow missed 40 hours in. It's so, so nice to look at, and besides the bugs, Cyberpunk 2077 runs pretty well, though I worry about how much I'm leaning on Nvidia's DLSS feature to keep my framerates high. With an RTX 2080, i9-9900K, and installed on a SATA SSD, with DLSS enabled on Quality mode on the High graphics preset (no ray-tracing), I maintain a variable 60-80 fps at 2560x1440, dipping lowest when driving through particularly reflection-heavy parts of town. With DLSS off, the frame window drops to 40-50 fps. Ray-tracing options are particularly resource intensive, so I just kept them off. The framerate hit wasn't worth the fancy lighting, nice as it looks on a rainy day or in a neon-lit club especially. Someday. Either way, a newer card will go a long way in Cyberpunk 2077, though players still hanging in at 1080p should do fine with older hardware. It's the kind of game I'd upgrade for though, because Cyberpunk is a technical stunner and seeing your friends in high definition is worth the ask. Sure, The Witcher 3 was funnier, more clever and subversive, with better dialogue on the whole, but I’m taken by how relentlessly hopeful Cyberpunk is. Its exploration of a technocapitalist future relies heavily on genre tropes, with everyone from punks to dirty cops playing the part established way back in William Gibson's Neuromancer. But Cyberpunk 2077 remains a loving, faithful treatment of the genre, and one that constantly urged me to look for the silver lining in every shit-soaked gutter.Even if you can nosedive V into a life of crime and greed, the repercussions highlight what's possible in the relief of what you reject in favor of power and money. Cyberpunk 2077 is a game about close relationships, or if you're roleplaying a more coldhearted type, seeing what life is like at the top without them. I found it moving and life-affirming in the final moments, even in the face of near certain death and a relentless onslaught of bugs. I suppose it's an appropriate thematic throughline though: Cyberpunk 2077 is a game about V coming apart at the seams, in a city coming apart at the seams, in a game coming apart at the seams. Play it in a few months.Some nice characters and stories nested in an astounding open world, undercut by jarring bugs at every turn. James is stuck in an endless loop, playing the Dark Souls games on repeat until Elden Ring and Silksong set him free. He's a truffle pig for indie horror and weird FPS games too, seeking out games that actively hurt to play. Otherwise he's wandering Austin, identifying mushrooms and doodling grackles. I tried Cyberpunk 2077's new RT Overdrive mode on my 30-series Nvidia GPU, and I was pleasantly surprisedCyberpunk 2077's fancy RT Overdrive graphics is now live and ready to bring your GPU to its kneesThe Rise of the Triad: Ludicrous Edition remaster has an optional HUD with a Doom-style ouch faceBy Phil Iwaniuk6 April 2023By Dave James5 April 2023By Kizito Katawonga4 April 2023By Jacob Ridley4 April 2023By Ian Evenden4 April 2023By Jorge Jimenez3 April 2023By Luke Winkie3 April 2023By Ted Litchfield31 March 2023By Robin Valentine31 March 2023By Katie Wickens31 March 2023By Dave James30 March 2023PC Gamer is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy.I've spent more time than I'd like to admit just staring at Night City. At its neon-lit streets, dappled with pink and yellow after rain; at the smoke rising through the elevator shaft in V's apartment building; at the shimmer of chrome running through the arms and faces of NPCs; at the lurid metallics and high-gloss clothing that adorn its citizens; or simply at yet another city-wide vista I've discovered after driving to a new hill in the Badlands. Cyberpunk 2077 is beautiful. Release date: November 10, 2020
Platform(s): PC, PS4, Xbox One
Developer: CD Projekt Red
Publisher: Bandai NamcoCyberpunk 2077's world is such an aesthetic joy that it feels disrespectful to fast travel or skip drives in Night City. At times, it feels as if the game has transformed into some living, voyeuristic screensaver, such is its ability to distract with its good looks.  It's not just the way the city comes to life at night either, as the appropriately titled Night City does look ridiculous in the dark – all neon shimmer and glowing reflections, the headlights of your car carving out a path through the concrete or the dust of the Badlands. Night City brings out the beauty in every slice of the day. But it's always quick to remind you that life within Night City is brutal, raw, and oh so violent. But that's what you're hoping for right? After all, a great setting will only get you so far. As you'd expect from the team that brought you The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Cyberpunk 2077 is a masterpiece of world-building, full of intrigue and distraction that will keep you diving from one quest into another with glee. Quests take various forms, from the Main Jobs to the Side Jobs (which are basically core missions in all but name), down to those that you'll stumble upon like Gigs and Police Scanner Hustles. What all of that results in is a map that's a mess of icons, which can initially feel overwhelming, but actually just means that you're rewarded for exploring NIght City. Turning a corner down a side street could offer up anything from shiny cars and bikes for sale or a ripperdoc clinic to dive into for some cyberware enhancements, to the mysterious gigs that only reveal themselves when you get into their proximity and you get a call from the local fixer involved. Night City only gets richer and more enticing the longer you spend in it. You'll want to explore everything Cyberpunk 2077 has to offer, because the core campaign is surprisingly short – should you focus solely on the Main Jobs. Ignore Side Jobs, Gigs, and other Night City lures and you could be looking at a completion time of somewhere in the 15 to 20 hours region. But, you'll also be doing the game a huge disservice by powering through V's core task, so while it's possible, I'd also strongly advise against it. What I will say though is that I was genuinely taken aback at facing a 'point of no return' warning in the core campaign that felt like it arrived just as the story was really hitting its stride. CD Projekt Red has said previously that Cyberpunk 2077 is ""slightly shorter"" than the Witcher 3 in an attempt to get more people to see the story through to its conclusion, but this warning felt like it came out of nowhere. However, if finishing The Witcher 3 was a feat that not everyone could achieve, completing Cyberpunk 2077 is an experience that – hopefully – a larger majority of players can have. But, more importantly, for what Cyberpunk lacks in campaign length, it more than makes up for with the depth and breadth of the content available in Night City. It's here that the Side Jobs are incredibly crucial – and quite the misnomer. While it's tempting to dismiss them as mere filler, they are campaign arcs in their own right, exploring narratives with core characters that bring light, colour, and complexity to the main story – not to mention the possibility to influence the ending. While I won't spoil anything for you, it's here that you'll find a different side to Cyberpunk 2077, a more emotional, human side away from the guns, gangs, and gore. You'll become so emotionally invested in these characters that it's easy to become more engrossed in them than V's own plight. There's warmth here, brilliant humour, and an emotional punch that you won't always expect, delivering compelling characters that will no doubt rank as some of the best gaming has to offer. It's the same for the Gigs too, quick-fire mini-quests that act as small distractions from the main story and multiple-hour Side Job arcs. Gigs range from the straightforward to the downright bizarre, and more than once I found myself laughing out loud at the brilliant absurdity of it all. Johnny Silverhand, of course, also adds to the game's appeal. Played by Keanu Reeves, Silverhand is your constant companion, commenting on your escapades and the decisions you'll make at every opportunity. He's a bizarre presence, and not always a welcome one, but the rockerboy never fails to add something to a situation. Love him or hate him by the end, there's no doubt you won't have appreciated the rollercoaster that Silverhand provides as you watch the credits scroll. How you feel about him though, and any of the characters that stagger into V's life, will always depend on the choices you've made in Cyberpunk 2077. While that starts with the character customisation and your choice of lifepath, it continues until the very last moments of the game. As I mentioned in my preview, while Cyberpunk 2077 offers up the more traditional dialogue choices, it also comes the closest to mimicking human interaction. No longer do you need to ""press X to interact"" with someone, just go up to them and start talking. You can choose to pick up on something else that's happening in the room mid-conversation if you want, speak to someone else for a bit, or simply just walk away. The choices you make may not always cause the story to divert dramatically, but you'll never quite know how far-reaching your decisions are until you've made them. That breadth of choice extends to the combat too. You'll find weaponry aplenty in Night City, from a katana called the Black Unicorn to a sniper rifle that can blow people's heads to bits like a particularly pleasing pimple pop, but what you choose to do with them is up to you. The game features a wealth of upgrade trees for abilities and associated perks that let you really dial into the kind of person you want your V to be. Prefer a stealth option? Put your perk points into improving your netrunner and cyberware abilities so you can set an enemy on fire from a safe distance. Want to become an elite shotgun specialist? There are plenty of perks for that. Initially, the wealth of options within the perks can feel overwhelming, but the more you play, the easier it becomes to tweak and enhance the things you want to be proficient in. The switch to FPS from the RPG format of The Witcher 3 is a huge change too. But CD Projekt Red has done a great job making the combat always feel rewarding. It's not quite as nuanced as The Witcher 3, but you'll feel the benefits and differences not only between each gun type, but also individual weapons – you'll soon have your favourites, trust me. For me it's the ability to mix cyberware-powered hacking and enhancements (like legs that let you double jump) with gunplay that's the real draw, allowing you to balance stealth and hands-off attacks with the option to quickly switch tactics as needed. You can go full-melee if you want - I'd fully recommend the mantis blades - but that would require a decent amount of prep work and strategy, learning how best to block and manage your stamina to avoid being taken down immediately.Even after 50+ hours with Cyberpunk 2077, which includes seeing my first ending and completing all the main side quests, I still feel like I have plenty to see in Night City. Gigs still litter the map, fixers still call me for help, and I've not even started my car collection yet. Even after all this time, I can't get enough of Night City, and thankfully very little has gotten in the way of experiencing it. The only bugs I've encountered to date have mostly been visual - like missing vehicles, floating weapons, or random stuck menu bars - and have been easily fixed with a quick save and reload. Plus, all of which have been promised to be patched out with the Day One patch that's yet to drop. What has been an absolute joy though is experiencing Cyberpunk 2077 at full Ultra Ray-Tracing setting via the Nvidia RTX 3080. Having started the review on an RTX 2070 Super running the game on Ray-Tracing Medium settings, the jump up to the Ultra settings felt like switching on a realism mode that I've not seen before in games. The additional levels of fidelity offered by ray-tracing for the shadows and reflections meant I was constantly peering into mirrors and inspecting the city shining back to me in the bonnet of my Porsche. It's hard to overstate just how good Cyberpunk 2077 looks on PC, and although this won't be the options available to everyone, this is the best graphical experience gaming has to offer right now. Cyberpunk 2077 is a paragon of open-world gaming, offering the kind of freedom to explore and define your character that provides a new pinnacle for the genre. It takes everything we celebrate about open-world games, and learns from it, implementing best-in-class variations in a world that's so dense and detailed. Add in the human-like level of reactivity and emotional depth that it brings to its narrative, and it all combines for the most spectacular experience. Take a trip to Night City immediately.Reviewed on PC (specs: RTX 3080 provided by Nvidia, Intel i9-9900k, 32GB RAM).

Cyberpunk 2077,Jason Guisao,Game Informer,https://www.gameinformer.com/review/cyberpunk-2077/cyberpunk-2077-last-gen-review-a-tale-of-two-night-cities,"Cyberpunk 2077 hosts a massive sandbox filled to the brim with politically charged conflicts catalyzed by powerful people. Protagonist V might grace the game’s box art, but the hero is overshadowed by Night City’s towering skyscrapers and intriguing citizens. From sunny beaches to gloomy landfills, Night City feels alive even when you’re not around to witness every shady transaction or police investigation. At least, it does when you’re not playing Cyberpunk 2077 on last-gen hardware.On high-end PCs, the allure of interacting with VIPs and coasting down neon-bright boulevards is on full display, despite Cyberpunk 2077’s notorious glitches. Chromatic implants glisten in dark hotel rooms, flickering lightbars boast picture-perfect reflections in rain puddles, and character models are particularly striking. However, the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions of Cyberpunk 2077 are marred by several additional bugs and ugly visuals. Overall, my extended stay in Night City was unpleasant, and a far cry from the experience PC players have described.Even after I decluttered my screen by disabling film grain and many of Cyberpunk 2077’s other graphical features (these options don’t noticeably enhance the visuals when kept active), the look of the game remained the same: Drab and dreary. The colors are drained of vibrance – vehicle paint jobs, flashy jumbotrons, even the sun’s rays. NPCs are poorly rendered and appear as indiscernible shapes. And surfaces have flat textures that are obvious at most draw distances. It’s hard to enjoy the interactivity of Night City when quest givers or companions are polygonal blobs, and that sweet sportscar you spent a small fortune on is just a blurry object with pallid wheels. Eventually, these textures load, but by then, the damage to immersion has already been done.Framerate drops are a common occurrence and tend to disrupt basic exploration and action sequences. In densely populated districts like Watson and Heywood, you’re often forced to stop as the hardware attempts to manage the myriad NPCs and traffic jams. I’ve also noticed that when driving at high speeds, the game freezes regularly, which can lead to crashes.The spotty enemy A.I. from the PC version carries over here, but trying to fulfill objectives covertly or survive boss encounters can be frustratingly difficult when the frames start to randomly hiccup. On multiple occasions, I’d sneak behind an enemy to incapacitate them, the game would seemingly pause for loading purposes, and then suddenly the guard I was targeting would randomly respawn behind me. Smaller bugs (like T-posed NPCs) stopped happening on a regular basis after CD Projekt Red’s latest hotfix, but game-breaking issues – weapons not appearing, the scanner being unusable – forced me to reload saves or restart my console periodically.I can’t help but lament Cyberpunk 2077’s potential. Night City is an ambitious open world. Seaside carnivals give way to bustling marketplaces. Trailer park communities hide in the shadows of glass spires. Meeting new faces is exciting and selecting unique lines of dialogue can even change the outcome of a side quest or relationship. Your choices always feel meaningful. But appreciating all of that is practically impossible on these consoles; graphics aren’t necessarily the most important part of a game, but in the last-gen versions of Cyberpunk 2077, the visuals and performance are so bad that they neutralize the game’s biggest strengths.Cyberpunk 2077 wasn’t optimized for last-gen consoles, and no amount of interesting side activities can remedy that. On PC, the world lives up to its title as the “City of Dreams.” For Xbox One and PlayStation 4 players, however, their time in Night City is likely a nightmare.If you have the enhanced versions of last-gen consoles – PS4 Pro or Xbox One X – Cyberpunk 2077 is a smoother experience. At the very least, the NPCs look fine and textures are far more detailed, although I spotted occasional pop-in. Bugs and crashes might still plague your playthrough from time to time, but the experience feels more stable, and is definitely a step up from the base Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions.

Cyberpunk 2077,Andrew Reiner,Game Informer,https://www.gameinformer.com/review/cyberpunk-2077/cyberpunk-2077-review-a-wild-time-in-night-city,"Cyberpunk 2077 is a work of awe-inspiring ambition, dazzling with its massive scale and creative vision. The world of Night City is a metropolis of futuristic art, stealing your eye with stunning neon-lit architecture and streets filled with citizens made of flesh and metal. Night City is an open world that immediately pulls you in and keeps you engaged with its dark narrative, meaningful player choice, and overwhelming amount of side content.Your lens into this tech-obsessed society is the protagonist simply named V, a cyberpunk who you fully design, including their voice, backstory (which subtly alters the narrative), and even their genitals. I spent far too much time creating my look, even though I rarely saw it during play due to the mostly first-person perspective. V is fun to control thanks to immense amounts of cybertech, but is an unlikable lead, spouting off profanity and groan-inducing one-liners, and generally displaying a “scum of the earth” personality.V, while making a mess of conversations, has an interesting story to tell. It goes places I didn’t expect and gets wild toward the end. The narrative hits its stride when V meets Johnny Silverhand, a former terrorist who is now a digital construct that lives in V’s mind. Silverhand’s thoughts and dark ambitions are twisted and dangerous, leading to great conversational choices and decisions that allow players to shape the story and action. The biggest allure of Silverhand is how he’s brought to life by actor Keanu Reeves, who looks and sounds as awesome in the role as he does in any film on the silver screen. Given how wonderful some of the other characters are (with their own long and fantastic arcs), Reeves doesn’t steal the show – but Silverhand is a constant throughout most of the game and helps save V from being too overbearing.Silverhand will bring a smile to your face, but Cyberpunk 2077 doesn’t have many joyous bones in its body, and is often heavy in the delivery of its dark content. Night City may be vibrant, but it's home mostly to evil people doing terrible things. Some of the content made me uncomfortable, including story moments dealing with abuse and sexual assault. Even the average bystanders sometimes gave me pause, such as a drugged woman being held in place by a man, a setup seen all over the city. Developers should be free to explore all subject matter, but it sometimes feels careless in Cyberpunk 2077 – more like edgy set-dressing than meaningful commentary.Much like V’s inability to think clearly with Silverhand clouding the mind, Cyberpunk 2077’s story often has different tones, and is all over the place from mission to mission. In one side story, V may come across as likable and mature. In the next, V suddenly sounds like an angsty teenager again (the tone you hear most). It’s hit or miss, but most quests deliver awesome moments, particularly when new NPCs are introduced. Almost every mission-giver or notable character is vividly brought to life in voice, animation, and by the crazy amounts of detail on their body. The same can be said for many of the locations they inhabit; an outstanding level of detail in the world makes each unique area a sight to behold. I can’t stress this enough; exploring Night City is a huge hook that CD Projekt Red knocks out of the park.Some of the more memorable characters and story arcs are tucked off to the side, and you may never see them if you don’t veer off of the critical path (which can be completed in roughly 15 to 20 hours). I don’t know how many dozens (or hundreds) of hours of side content are around it, but the mission log just keeps growing as you play. While the main story sequences often end with cliffhangers that demand resolution and the thought that you should continue on that path, the best way to experience Cyberpunk 2077 is to see what the city has to offer. Walk into a crowded market, explore a mysterious question mark on your map, and take on the side missions that the denizens are offering – just surrender yourself to moment-to-moment discovery.CD Projekt Red wants you to soak in the beauty of the world, but also demands you spend plenty of time in menus assigning new abilities, crafting, and sorting through heaps of loot. That isn’t a knock against the game. It’s all handled quite well. Any room you enter could have numerous items to pick up, as well as world-building text you can read. The amount of leveling you can do is immense, which is reflected on sprawling ability charts that take considerable amounts of time to fill out. If you only focus on the critical path, you barely scratch the surface of the abilities, which carry significant advantages to combat, stealth, hacking, and dialogue. It’s amazing how much you can improve and expand upon V’s standard attributes. I also love how doing various things helps improve V in those fields.Using cyberware and abilities to mess with enemies is good fun, such as cooking a grenade in an enemy's pocket. Hacking cameras and activating devices from afar to distract foes makes stealth satisfying. I enjoyed creeping through environments, hacking the cameras and turrets as I went. I leaned more on stealth than expected, partially because I didn’t find the gunplay enthralling. The weapons you obtain feel awesome (and give good reason to track down the legendary and iconic versions), but the enemy A.I. isn’t great, leading to headshots being delivered like they are going out of style. Some enemies think they are hidden behind thin railings, others charge foolishly toward you and then stop without any cover around them. Harder missions (which are nicely indicated on the log) are a little more intense given the spike in difficulty, but the adversaries are still easy to manipulate, unless they are an aggressive boss or cyber ninja that crowds you quickly.Johnny Silverhand sadly isn’t the only glitch in Cyberpunk 2077. Not since The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim have I played a game that is riddled with so many graphical bugs at launch. The danger of entering a seedy bar loses its bite when one of its patrons stands motionless in a T-pose. A high-speed motorcycle chase down a highway is far less intense than it should be when an NPC biker shakes so much he looks like a blur. Little visual hitches in the environment and characters occur frequently, and they’re jarring, but I rarely ran into anything that affected gameplay. The only major issues I experienced were I could no longer look down the sight of my guns during one mission – reloading my save fixed the issue. I also had a digitized visual effect remain after a cutscene. Again, I had to reload and replay a sequence to get the proper outcome. Regardless, the frequency of the odd visual moments hurts immersion, and can outright ruin a suspenseful moment.Cyberpunk 2077 is dark and disturbing at times (frighteningly so), but the majority of its content is fascinating, and loaded with depth through the various RPG systems and lore. I thoroughly enjoyed my time in Night City, and Johnny Silverhand is a great partner to see the sights with. Cyberpunk 2077 doesn’t overstay its welcome with its critical-path story, and invites players to jack in and stay for hundreds of hours of unique content should they want to. It didn't blow me away like The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, but is still a hell of an opening to what will hopefully be a new series.As of this writing, the best way to experience Cyberpunk 2077 is on a high-end gaming PC. That’s how I played for this review, but I also saw how the game performs on various PlayStation and Xbox machines. The visuals and performance take a significant hit on the base PlayStation 4 and Xbox One systems, sometimes looking downright ugly in larger spaces occupied by numerous characters. Even the more powerful PlayStation 4 Pro and Xbox One X struggle with the content (though they run a little better). If you absolutely have to play it on a console, the Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 are the way to go, but it should be noted that they are running the PS4 and Xbox One versions via backwards compatibility. While you see better framerates and resolutions on the new-gen hardware, the performance is still a far cry from PC. CD Projekt Red has said it will release a free next-gen upgrade that truly takes advantage of the power of these machines at some point in 2021.

Cyberpunk 2077,Cameron Kunzelman,Polygon,https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23014759/cyberpunk-2077-patch-1-5-review-ps5-xbox-series-x,"Filed under:Re-examining CD Projekt’s Achilles heel after patch 1.5Cyberpunk 2077 was one of the most anticipated releases of 2020. The newest project from The Witcher developer CD Projekt Red, it was promoted as a sea change in video games that would merge the deep history of R. Talsorian Games’ sprawling cyberpunk Night City with storytelling chops that made Geralt’s adventures in The Witcher so compelling for so many of us. It was all portrayed in first-person perspective, to really sell us on our protagonist V’s embodied relationship with the world around them.But in a move typical for the cyberpunk genre, there was a stark difference between the hype and the actual thing. The game landed with a dull thud, the stark reality of which could be blamed on any number of factors called out by reviewers and players: plodding cyberpunk gameplay, the general emptiness of the world, and a lack of compelling narrative. Over all of this loomed a series of technical problems that quickly transformed Cyberpunk 2077 into a generator of glitchy memes and exposed a rushed game produced under distressing crunch conditions. Substantial performance errors prompted its removal from Sony’s PlayStation Store, and the intervening months have been a slow crawl of CD Projekt fixing, adding, and tweaking the game in incremental updates — an extensive bid to bring it in line with its marketing promises.Now, 16 months later, the prevailing question I am still regularly asked is, “Is Cyberpunk 2077 ‘good’ now?”In February 2022, CD Projekt released a substantial patch, version 1.5, for Cyberpunk 2077. It contains a large number of tweaks and fixes, some new content, and native support for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Reading the patch notes is a lengthy time commitment, but the general gist is that CD Projekt has overhauled some part of nearly every game system in Cyberpunk 2077, from combat AI, to player stat functions, to the economy, to the way that vehicles work. These big post-release swings are not unfamiliar to the developer, since it performed similar system and world overhauls with the second and third Witcher games. However, this is the first time that a single patch has had the weight of “fixing” an entire game on its back. It is a heavy weight, and I’d be lying if I said that having to evaluate how “fixed” the game is did not weigh on me heavily as I booted the game up on Playstation 5 once it was re-launched back in February.

  In the weeks since, I have leisurely played through Cyberpunk 2077 for the first time. My eyes are as fresh as they can be, since I skipped the initial game to wait for the inevitable second swing. My verdict, put shortly, if you’re looking for the soundbite: Cyberpunk 2077 is now a pretty good game.It works. It takes place in a world that seems to be the one that everyone anticipated at launch. People are living their lives in the massive Night City, and the player character V is just another character caught up in a process of trying to get a little bit higher in the hierarchy. You can wander from dirty streets to perfect skyline suites in the megatowers without much fuss, and the various missions thread V like a needle through these political realities rendered into spatial forms, the same way that any other piece of cyberpunk media does (thanks, Fredric Jameson). Based on reading reviews of the original Cyberpunk 2077and comparing it to my experience of completing the new Cyberpunk 2077 over the past few days, it seems that a key difference between pre- and post-1.5 is one of intensity. At launch, CD Projekt seemed to nail scale, in that the world was massive and appropriately futuristic. What it fumbled was a sense of density, a feeling that this big world contained functioning people — other than the player character — going about their business. The game world lacked a sense of weight, as if everything existed merely for the illusion of there being a city here rather than an evocation of a real metropolis, with shops and stalls and cyberpunk criminals and their entire network of economic relations. It is a strange marker of current video game culture that this is the thing that we most desire, since by definition the entirety of a video game environment is a technical illusion to make a player feel important. The people on the sidewalk in any given game are not there to be full people. They are there to give context, and a certain aesthetic feeling, to a player speeding by them in a souped-up future car. If there is a key maneuver in patch 1.5, it is that these fantasies seem to be fulfilled. NPCs interact minimally with their environment, and they panic when gunfire starts nearby. They behave “realistically,” and like most of the non-player content in the game, seem to be a drastic leap forward from the videos you might remember from the disturbingly gleeful “look at this shit” responses that highlighted technical problems in 2020. The combat also seems markedly different from the initial release. I played as a very technical boy, infecting enemies with powered-up hacks into their vital organs while I stalked around the combat zone. It was very clear to me how my strategy differed from the others on offer, giving me a feeling of being a razor blade tactically working through groups of foes. When my more elegant skills weren’t up to the task, I could always go at my cybernetic enemies with a baseball bat. The gunplay, which often feels inevitable at many junctures, has more of the flavor of a warmed-over Far Cry with some weapon concepts, like assault rifles with tracking bullets, that felt lifted directly out of 2012’s Syndicate. While there is an entire weapon upgrade system, with a large number of materials to gather and source, the game’s content is paced in such a way that another, better weapon is always dropping off an enemy corpse, trivializing the entire system. As a scavenger lord who enjoyed playing that way, I value this as an excellent way to experience a lot of weapon types. I can imagine a more tactical gamer finding this frustrating.One of the big hopes that I, and many others, had for Cyberpunk 2077 rested in how it might approach storytelling in its science-fictional universe. The Witcher games are successful at building up its core cast of characters and putting them in positions where we get a sense of them as three-dimensional humans, with thoughts and feelings and complications that are rarely represented within video games. The decision to make this cyberpunk game within the Cyberpunk brand identity meant that this game could build on the deep history of this world developed by Mike Pondsmith in the R. Talsorian Games Cyberpunk setting for more than 30 years.CD Projekt’s promotional material took pains to tell you about Night City and all of that history, locating V within this nest of relationships before players even got their hands on the product. This world history, and the players in it, are what give context to the open world and its various zones and factions. It matters that you understand that Night City is sliced up by a dozen different groups, each with their own desires for the future and traditions that they keep alive. In turn, those groups provide a backdrop against which we understand the game’s primary characters like Johnny Silverhand, Panam Palmer, or the Arasaka corporate family. As a genre, cyberpunk is often exploring questions of who is constrained by what, and novels like Bruce Sterling’s Islands in the Net or William Gibson’s Neuromancer operate partially on the thrill of watching their characters break through the social, economic, and technical walls that have captured them.The mode here is (unsurprisingly) just like that of The Witcher: The main character, V, is shaped by how the player interacts with the other characters in various situations, where difficult decisions have to be made in a nightmarish world of violence where the lights are bright and life is cheap.

  However, the created-character nature of V, and the various backgrounds that V can be from (like a Nomad or a Corporate stooge) give Cyberpunk 2077 more of a Mass Effect vibe. The other characters are strongly drawn, with their own questlines, and when V enters their orbit, everyone’s life changes in some tangible, notable way. From a broad perspective, this works in that Mass Effect mode where my understanding of V allowed me to make decisions from their perspective, but there is something lost in the “player-created” nature of V. While Night City has a big cast of characters with their own history with the place, the unwillingness to locate V firmly within that place means that everything sort of washes over me as a player. When Geralt met a new character or visited a new location in The Witcher 3, he always knew a little something about the context he was entering into, and my work as a player was to guide him through it and learn what I could. V, without a firm history, glides from mission to mission and place to place without much connection, knowing only what a questgiver tells them. For such a specific place and a specific time, so many of the things I did in the game ended up feeling generic. This is, frankly, astonishing to me.Even the design elements CD Projekt has deployed to check this dislocated feeling work in strange ways. I chose the Corporate background, which meant the game began with my firing from Arasaka corp, and I had some additional dialogue options whenever corporate politics became the focus. However, early in the game, that merely unlocked sarcastic or manipulative dialogue responses, allowing me to get deeper into a convo with my corporate-speak; by the end of the game, those same Corpo dialogue choices became almost entirely about obedience and pro-corporate approaches. This switch midstream of what a game mechanic does ultimately produces a situation where I could not make assumptions or assertions about V to give them a role-playing grounding on my own terms. This robbed many late-game moments of the gravity they might have had.If there is a strength to be found in this narrative form, it lies in its characters and the struggles you help them through, including Johnny Silverhand, a construct that is trapped in V’s head. The entire plot of the game revolves around trying to eject Johnny, since the chip that trapped him there is slowly killing V. While there are some truly compelling gameplay moments that happen around this mixed-up biopsyche, such as segments where Silverhand controls V’s body and gets involved in rock and roll shenanigans, Silverhand (and Keanu Reeves’ performance) are eclipsed by more marginal characters like the idealist detective River or the aging fixer Rogue. There’s not a single character in Cyberpunk 2077 that isn’t a cyberpunk genre stereotype that has been picked over for 50 years to the point of triteness. But both the writing and performances for these characters had me engaged enough that I was always waiting for another of their missions to unlock.As I finished four of the game’s endings, I told a friend that Cyberpunk 2077 felt weirdly like a holdover from another era of game design. At its core, it feels like a well executed Mass Effect welded onto a Far Cry; the narrative designs of the former feel layered on top of the hostile encounter, open-world nodes of the latter. Where The Witcher 3 was synthesizing a lot of pre-existing game ideas to make something unique, Cyberpunk 2077 is less coherent as an object on its own. You can play at the seams and feel the staples holding it all together. At this point, post-1.5, the most notable points of friction no longer feel like the result of development foibles or a lack of time. Instead, they feel like part of the game’s DNA — the faults that were there before any problems in final execution.It is worth thinking here about the decisions behind a major patch like this, which focuses almost entirely on the technical and gameplay sides of the game. There’s been no attempt to soften or explore the cyberpunk genre’s deployment of techno-orientalism in its treatment of Asian culture and characters, which is a huge missed opportunity in a game that spends so much time ruminating on the mistakes of the past, and how one might repair them. A transphobic ad is still plastered across nearly every surface in the game, monopolizing vision in a way that does not even line up with real-world advertising practices. With this game’s long tail of updates, there are seemingly infinite chances to go deeper, to rethink some assumptions, and to engage with the genre at least as fully as its founding texts did. Yet none of these things were deemed patch-worthy. It is more substantive, apparently, to make sure there are new apartments and cars and guns.While patch 1.5 works, and it brings Cyberpunk 2077 up to whatever minimum standard people thought it should have been up to at launch. Playing the game for the first time now makes it clear that that high watermark is merely serviceable, and that the basic ideas in Cyberpunk 2077 are good enough to pass the time, but not enough to be truly great, or even a substantive look at the genre the game clings to. From pre-release hype to abysmal release to pretty good a year post-release, it’s a cyberpunk story for sure. But it is impossible for me to play the game after this patch and not think about how so many other games, with so many more interesting ideas and takes on the genre, are not going to get the second swing that Cyberpunk 2077 is going to get over the next year. Years of dev time to produce a standard and familiar 1980s dystopia in a pretty good frame. Just another day in Night City. Cyberpunk 2077 patch 1.5 was released on Feb. 15 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. The game was reviewed on PlayStation 5 using a pre-release download code provided by CD Projekt Red. Vox Media has affiliate partnerships.

Cyberpunk 2077,Carolyn Petit,Polygon,https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22158019/cyberpunk-2077-review-cd-projekt-red-pc-ps4-xbox-one-stadia,"Filed under:CD Projekt Red’s open-world game does not exactly have a futuristic worldview[Ed. note (Dec. 15): Polygon reviewed Cyberpunk 2077 on Windows PC. We did not receive console code until the game’s Dec. 10 release date. Having since spent time with the game on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, we have noticed significant differences in visual fidelity and performance between the console and PC versions. The following review reflects our experience on PC. We strongly discourage readers from playing Cyberpunk 2077 on consoles until the game has been dramatically improved via software patches.]Viewed from a distance — say, from the vast desert outskirts known as the Badlands — Night City looks like a beacon, so massive and promising in its potential that many denizens of Cyberpunk 2077’s brutal future see it as a place where they might escape their hardscrabble lives and fulfill their dreams. And yet, as the game reminds us again and again, those who come to Night City seeking a better life often find only hardship, struggle, and loneliness. Like the city in which it is set, Cyberpunk 2077 may give off one impression when regarded from afar, one carefully constructed through years of marketing hype, but once players experience it up close, they’ll find that the truth is something else. On one hand, it’s a more earnest and sincere game than all its edgy marketing has suggested. On the other, though the word cyberpunk evokes a radical vision of the future, there’s nothing revolutionary on offer here. Instead, it’s a game obsessed with the past.Before you hit the streets of Night City, you’ll construct your version of the game’s central character, V, in a process indicative of one of Cyberpunk 2077’s most glaring problems. For whatever reason, among all the hairstyles and eyes and makeup and tattoos you might expect, genitals are included as part of the character creation process, with two penis options — and three size settings for each! — and one vagina. (You can also opt not to select genitals at all, always viewing your V in panties or boxers at a bare minimum.) Ahead of the release of Cyberpunk 2077, CD Projekt Red faced scrutiny from reporters for its work practices, particularly with regard to “crunch,” a term referring to long overtime hours lasting weeks or months. Despite past promises to the contrary, the company imposed obligatory crunch on some employees. Cyberpunk 2077 also faced criticism for its marketing — in particular, the usage of a sexualized trans model in a promotional poster, as well as the flippant tone used in much of the game’s advertising and social media.Even after release, Cyberpunk 2077 remains a work in progress for CD Projekt Red. The game launched with various performance issues, particularly on last-generation consoles, although more updates to the game are forthcoming. Console review codes for Cyberpunk 2077 were not provided to media outlets until release day.Thankfully, your character’s gender is not tied to your choice of genitals. You can create a dude with a vagina or a lady with a penis, that’s no problem. But because of everything else about how the game handles trans identity, this hardly feels like the progressive step it should be. Rather than just letting you pick your pronouns independently of all your other character creation choices, your pronouns are assigned based on your selection of voice: Pick the “feminine” voice and your pronouns are she/her, and vice versa. (There are no nonbinary pronoun options.) As a trans woman with a voice that many would not describe as “feminine,” this direct linking of gender identity to having a voice that sounds “masculine” or “feminine” feels weirdly essentializing. I could have forgiven it if the rest of the game took strides to humanize trans identities, but boy, it sure doesn’t. Ubiquitous throughout Night City are ads for a beverage called Chromanticure that feature a female-coded model with a penis visible through her skintight clothing, making it clear that in Cyberpunk 2077, trans bodies are objectified and commodified. Some cis bodies are, too, of course, but the crucial difference is that, as V, we constantly meet, interact with, and form relationships with cis characters who have far more dimension than the surface of any sexualized image on a billboard. The same can’t be said of trans characters. Even if you opt to play as a trans V, she’s not particularly well-defined. The game is about what you see through her eyes and what she goes through, not about who she is as a person.In my 40-plus hours in Night City, I never met a single character of any significance whom the game made clear was trans, and one of the only queer-coded characters I encountered was an extremely unsavory cybernetic surgeon who does extremely unsavory things. I did spot a trans flag on one character’s vehicle, though that hardly counts as positive trans representation and doesn’t even necessarily mean the character is trans. It felt more like a way for Cyberpunk 2077’s creators to say they had included positive trans representation without actually putting thought into it or making trans people a visible part of the makeup of Night City. I get that Cyberpunk’s dark future is intended not as a goal, but as something for humanity to avoid. As Mike Pondsmith, creator of the Cyberpunk tabletop game, has put it, “The Cyberpunk future is a warning; not an aspiration.” There’s real potential for a grim world like the one Cyberpunk 2077 offers to serve as a lens through which our own world is critiqued, but the developers at CD Projekt Red failed to do anything with the trans options and identities they incorporated into the game to make them function in this way, and as V, you never have the option to say or do anything about it. The objectification of trans people is just background texture, nothing more.For elements like the inescapable dehumanization of trans people on imagery throughout the city to function as any kind of critique of transphobia, the game itself would need to create tension around those images by showing us humanized trans people navigating that world. But it doesn’t. The result is a game in which transphobic players (of which there will be many) can just laugh at us by using the character creator to generate models they consider worthy of mockery and derision and by gagging at the Chromanticure ads they see everywhere, or perhaps by fetishizing the model while continuing to see trans people as objects of desire but not as full human beings. Meanwhile, we trans players are left wanting in its world for depictions that humanize us. Here in 2020, people boldly and bravely hack gender all the time. And yes, I know that Cyberpunk 2077 takes place on a separate timeline in which the year 2020 looked very different than it does for us, but it’s still a world in which people push their bodies to the extreme of technological modification, sometimes swapping out eyes or limbs like they’re changing clothes. You’d think transgressing gender norms would be pretty commonplace, too, and that as a result, a fundamentally different understanding of gender and of trans identity would have taken root in the world.As deeply unfortunate as this is, it’s but one facet of Cyberpunk 2077, a game that demands to be reckoned with in all of its messy, multifaceted entirety. V may be the central character of the game, but unlike Geralt in CD Projekt Red’s previous game, The Witcher 3, she is not the star. No, the star is Night City itself, vast and intricate, intimidating and awe-inspiring. To its credit, the Night City of Cyberpunk 2077 is not just an amalgamation of imagery lifted from other influential sources, but an original creation that incorporates many signifiers of cyberpunk genre flavor (lots of Japanese kanji in neon, airships slowly drifting through the sky) while also feeling like a place we haven’t seen before.Steam may issue forth from every surface, but this isn’t the shadowy aesthetic allure of Blade Runner. Night City is something altogether uglier and more chaotic than that, with its skyline of awkward megabuildings resembling a landscape assembled by a child out of chunky toy blocks. Drawing on the timeline of the metropolis as established across multiple generations of the tabletop role-playing game, the cluttered, ramshackle feel of the city’s districts makes sense given its history as a place that has seen tremendous destruction and upheaval, and is never all that far removed from the most recent crisis that necessitated massive rebuilding efforts.This turbulent history isn’t just something you feel in the look and design of the city. It’s something the narrative brings to thrilling life, too. You don’t need to be familiar with the specifics of Cyberpunk’s timeline going into Cyberpunk 2077 to appreciate all the ways in which your time in Night City is textured by a richly detailed past. Whether you’re passing through derelict maglev tunnels that speak to generations of abandoned infrastructure or you’re witnessing the violent rise of tensions that have been brewing in one of the world’s most powerful corporations for generations, Night City feels like much more than just a backdrop for a cyberpunk-flavored open-world adventure. Nothing in Cyberpunk 2077 brings you into closer contact with Night City’s storied past than Johnny Silverhand, the once-legendary rock star whose digitized consciousness takes up residence in your head via a highly sought-after biochip you slot into your brain during a heist gone sideways. Johnny is central to some of the biggest upheavals in Night City history, and as you carry the cybernetic construct of his personality around with you, playable flashbacks thrust you into that history, giving you a taste both of the blur of sex, drugs, and rock n’ roll that made up much of his life, and of the anticorporate actions that have him branded as a terrorist in some people’s eyes.In the Cyberpunk tabletop RPG, one of the playable classes is the rockerboy, a term for any musician or artist whose work stirs up public sentiment against evil corporations or other social ills. To me, the rockerboys are the one thing that prevents Cyberpunk as a property from being wholly defined by cynicism and violence. There’s something earnest and hopeful about the fact that the tabletop game wants players to see themselves not just as heavily armed solos and skilled netrunners, but also as artists whose creative output has the potential to change the world for the better. Of course, you can’t play as a rockerboy in Cyberpunk 2077, because V is a merc by trade, but that earnest ideology is still present in Johnny. Even if it’s covered up by layers of affected detachment, he’s still prone to reminiscing about the old days by saying grandiose things like this: “We fought for beauty. Not knowin’ what was good or true, was only the beautiful that meant a damn thing to us.”This is what I least expected about Cyberpunk 2077: that its notions of “cool” are so tied up in the digital persona of a past-his-prime rocker that the game sometimes feels like looking through your uncle’s musty record collection while he talks about how great the Rolling Stones are. When William Gibson’s genre-defining novels like Neuromancer and Count Zero first appeared in the mid-’80s, they were thrilling in part because they offered a vision of the future that felt entirely new, and with it, a whole new vision of “cool.” I believe there’s still potential for cyberpunk stories to be so boldly visionary and relevant, but Cyberpunk 2077 prefers to look back, an attitude reflected not just through Johnny’s efforts to avenge old grudges and to recapture the glory days of his band Samurai. In fact, the game’s entire worldview feels like the product of someone who’s about 30 years behind the times, who may have been rebellious and liberated once but who nowadays doesn’t understand why it’s messed up to call sex workers “whores,” as Johnny routinely does.Johnny is played, of course, by Keanu Reeves, and I can’t imagine anyone else in the role. Johnny is an asshole, with an ego as big as Night City, whose every word is uttered as if it’s so important that the whole world should take heed. But with Reeves’ charisma in play, this nigh-insufferable character remains just barely sufferable. Full disclosure: I’m a huge Keanu Reeves fan. I think there’s a vulnerability to him that makes even characters like John Wick, who in other hands might feel completely inaccessible and irredeemable, recognizably human. So it is here, too. Reeves’ natural tendencies as an actor help offset the worst tendencies of the character he’s playing, such that we can still understand, if only barely, why his old bandmates and other associates put up with him at all. This game isn’t the best vehicle for Reeves’ work, because while he provides both voice-over and motion capture for Johnny, there’s sometimes a disconnect between the two, moments where the animations Johnny performs don’t quite reflect the urgency or intensity of what he’s saying. And yet, I was always glad to walk into some dimly lit motel room or exclusive bar and find Johnny lurking in the corner, visible only to V, ready with some world-weary quip. Night City may be the star of Cyberpunk 2077, but Johnny Silverhand is its soul — weathered, outmoded, often tiresome, yet still weirdly compelling.There is one thing Cyberpunk 2077 gets right about the genre from which it takes its name: Many of the best cyberpunk stories are heist stories. They’re stories of planning and logistics, with lots of moving pieces and key players, each one bringing their own crucial skills to the mix. The game is at its best when it leans hard into this, as it does in the opening hours, which take their time introducing a number of accomplices and have you all laying the groundwork for the big job that brings V into contact with Johnny and sets the rest of the plot in motion. One of the great strengths of The Witcher 3 was that it really took its time with people and relationships. Similarly, Cyberpunk 2077 isn’t afraid to slow down for both plot and character development. Those tightly plotted early hours in particular, with their clandestine meetings at which characters obsess over gathering intel and acquiring all the necessary gear to accomplish an audacious crime, pull you into V’s life as a merc with her eyes on joining the exclusive ranks of Night City’s criminal elite.But what about the nuts-and-bolts stuff of doing V’s work? Cyberpunk 2077’s combat is fine, but other games, particularly the two Deus Ex games of the past decade, have much more effectively delivered on the fantasy of being a cybernetically augmented individual whose abilities enable them to approach situations in a number of creative and rewarding ways. Here, sneaking your way through gang-infested warehouses or corporate lobbies, you can hack objects to distract enemies or short-circuit their optics to blind them temporarily, but these abilities feel pretty tame compared to the opportunities for zany, emergent hacking mayhem offered in games like Watch Dogs: Legion.Guns in Cyberpunk 2077 do have a hefty, nasty brutality to them, and there’s some fleeting novelty in doing things like charging up a shot on a “power” weapon to blast an enemy through cover, but I had hoped for a more distinctive cyberpunk flavor in my Cyberpunk combat. Even the hacking minigame that you have to complete when performing certain actions is dead simple, and never did the game try to replicate the thrill of really hacking the ’net the way I’ve been dreaming of doing since I first read Neuromancer long ago. At a certain point I started finding katanas with pretty ridiculous damage output, after which my approach to combat (playing on the recommended Hard difficulty setting) often involved just rushing enemies and slashing them to bits, which provided a certain frenetic fun. The combat, while serviceable, isn’t a reason in and of itself for anyone to play this game. The reason to play is for the world and its people.Along with its use of heist structure, the other thing Cyberpunk 2077 gets right about the best cyberpunk stories is that cyberspace and other genre trappings should be more than just plot devices; they should be ways to explore ideas like mortality, identity, spirituality, and transcendence. With a construct of Johnny Silverhand lodged in V’s brain, slowly overwriting her identity, these philosophical concerns are built right into the narrative, as it sometimes becomes unclear where one character ends and the other begins. Unfortunately, Cyberpunk 2077’s main storyline doesn’t quite stick the landing. It reaches for big meaning in the end, but the result is more muddled and confusing than mysterious. Thankfully, surrounding the main storyline are a few substantial side quests with better payoffs. V can choose to help out a brilliant young techie who wants to put a group of exploited sex workers in charge of their own club, or a strong-willed nomad and her clan out in the Badlands. I was always grateful for any excuse to venture out into the spare beauty of the Badlands, those wide-open spaces a welcome antidote to the claustrophobic crush of Night City.One of my fears about Cyberpunk 2077 was that it was going to be so cynical and nihilistic that playing it would be like wallowing in grim hopelessness, that the cheapness of human life in the game’s world would be mirrored by the game itself. But that’s not the case. It’s easy to lose the human thread in the overwhelming glut of stuff Cyberpunk 2077 puts on your plate, with your map plastered with crimes you can violently “neutralize” for a reward from the police, and fixers constantly sending you text messages about underdeveloped one-off jobs you can take on to earn a bit of extra cash. But the humanity is there, if you look for it.And that humanity is the saving grace of this alluring yet uneven and deeply flawed game. I can’t deny that Night City wowed me with its scale, its verticality, and its sense of history. But I wish I could see people like me on its streets as something more than objects. I wish that the game’s politics were more radical. Yes, I know I shouldn’t look to a colossal game that was itself produced under exploitative labor conditions to lead the charge of anticapitalist liberation, but I wish the sparks of Johnny Silverhand’s ideological rage got to burn brighter, that Cyberpunk 2077 felt more interested in envisioning new futures than in reminiscing over bygone glories. Neither its gameplay nor its narrative can imagine the bold possibilities that I find so central to the best of cyberpunk. But what it does offer is visions of people trying to make do and get by in a world that’s trying to eat them alive, and sometimes those people get by with a little help from their friends. It’s not the revolution I hoped for, but it’s something.

   on December 15, 2020 at 3:59PM PSTEditor's note (December 15, 2020): The following review of Cyberpunk 2077 is based on the PC version of the game, as GameSpot did not receive console codes for the game until its release on December 10. There is a significant disparity in performance on PS4 and Xbox One compared to the PC version of Cyberpunk 2077 (as well as the console version running on PS5 and Xbox Series X). Developer CD Projekt Red has acknowledged the last-gen console version's poor performance, even offering refunds to disappointed players--though there is no specific arrangement to guarantee said refunds--and promising patches in early 2021. You can watch our base PS4 vs. PS5 comparison video to get a feel for how Cyberpunk 2077 plays on different hardware, but as it stands, GameSpot cannot recommend you play Cyberpunk 2077 on last-gen consoles; the frame rate is wildly inconsistent to the point of severe interference with gameplay, and frequent texture pop-in and poor visual quality overall make Night City muddy and ugly to look at. These versions also feature the litany of bugs we experienced on PC. We will revisit this when significant patches arrive, as well as when the game is officially released on next-gen consoles (it's currently only backwards compatible on PS5 and Series X, though the game performs far better on next-gen hardware already). The original PC review, published on December 7, 2020, continues below.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Cyberpunk 2077 ReviewEarly on in Cyberpunk 2077, there's a series of side quests that has you tracking down rogue taxis run by faulty AI. You have to talk one of the taxis down from suicide as it contemplates driving off a bridge, while another needs to be brute-forced into behaving, and a third is an obvious reference to a famous video game AI that manipulates you as you chase it down. It's one of the best minor questlines in the game, an intriguing and surprisingly human substory that rewards you with lots of much-needed cash. It's also an excuse to send you to every corner of Night City, a clever introduction to all the areas you haven't yet been.I spent a lot of my playtime following side-quest threads like this one, excited about the premise and hoping to find something as interesting or fun or rewarding at the end and, in many cases, I did. But now, after finishing the main story, I can't see how most of those activities fit into the overall narrative or the character I was playing. The main story doesn't even gel with itself.Cyberpunk 2077 draws heavily from its source material, with everything from the world itself to the life and death of Johnny Silverhand coming from its pen-and-paper inspiration. But unlike in a tabletop RPG, you aren't playing a role of your own creation in Cyberpunk 2077; you're playing V, and this is V's story, not yours. I often felt like I was role-playing two different characters: one V for the side quests and one more limited V for the main story.That's mostly because the main story puts you on a clock. It's not literally on a timer, but it is very urgent in the way that RPG stories often are, and it has the same pitfalls as a result. It feels weird to do throwaway fun stuff when you have a serious, ever-present threat to attend to, and in V's case, it just doesn't make sense to dally.You have more freedom to play the character you really want to during side activities, but main-story V has clearly defined priorities. I often couldn't find the character I'd been developing via side quests when I returned to the main plot--not in how I'd been shaping her personality as she reacted to events, nor in the hacker I built as she was forced into more traditional boss fights.I knew from the outset that I wanted to play as a hacker, so I sped through the character creator, gave my V points in intellect and cool for hacking and stealth, respectively, and started the game. I had picked the Nomad lifepath out of the three total options because it was the only one that positioned V as an outsider to Night City; I figured that I didn't know Night City yet as a newcomer to the game, so why should V?From what I can tell, that lifepath choice didn't affect more than the way the game starts and some dialogue options throughout (and possibly some minor side quests). Now that I've finished the story, I'm much more curious about the Corpo lifepath, in which V used to work at antagonist corporation Arasaka, and how that fits into what I played, but it doesn't feel like a majorly important decision in my experience.The real RPG core is in your five main stats, which are further split into two or three different skill trees, each providing various benefits to combat, stealth, hacking, and so on. Using these subskills will passively level them up and give you additional benefits, ensuring you grow according to how you play in addition to how you actively invest points as you level up.The parent skills mainly govern what dialogue options you can use and what kinds of doors you're able to open, at least in the moment-to-moment (they otherwise provide minor stat boosts). Because of this, I tended to invest skills based on my curiosity in conversations or to access areas I wanted to explore. For example, I'd bank points until I found myself in front of a door that required X points in body to force open, and then I'd level up right there and then so I could see what was behind the door. Because the subskills have their own leveling and points system, I found I could freely invest overall skill points without sacrificing my hacking goals--at least when it came to the traditional RPG progression.Hacking into computers and transferring money to your account is one thing; it only requires enough points in the intellect parent skill, just like how body allows you to open certain doors. On the other hand, quickhacking, which allows you to manipulate cameras, turrets, enemies, and more in hostile scenarios, requires a lot of cyberware investment. Specifically, you need a good cyberdeck--which determines how many different quickhacks you can equip--that has enough RAM so you can use ones that demand more memory.Cyberware in general is not cheap. On top of that, an early story mission is gated by a significant sum of money, so I had to do a lot of grinding before I could afford a proper cyberdeck that made my quickhacks truly effective. Until then, I felt like I had to use guns a lot more than I wanted to, which didn't fit with how I initially built my character. I didn't mind the guns overall, though; while it's not on par with dedicated first-person shooters, the gunplay is decent. It's a little clunky, even after tweaking my sensitivity settings, but the aim assist does the heavy lifting.Once I got a good cyberdeck and equipped better quickhacks, combat really picked up for me. I had a quickhack that reset an enemy's optics--pretty much everyone in Night City has cyberware in place of organic eyes--and temporarily blinded them, which allowed me to sneak past. I was able to shut off entire camera systems easily and set turrets to ""friendly mode"" so they wouldn't shoot me on sight. I approached most encounters like a puzzle: I'd hack into the camera systems to see how many enemies I was dealing with, then figure out who to distract and in which direction so I could move from room to room undetected. If that didn't work, I at least knew I could jam their weapons or shock their systems from afar.When I found my rhythm and found the cash, I really enjoyed quickhacking as an alternative approach to combat, and it was always satisfying to get in, steal a bunch of money off some computers, and get out without being spotted.Because I was so focused on this aspect of my character (and saving money to invest in it), I didn't end up spending much time on other approaches; I got the mantis blades, which are cyberware swords that spring out of your arms, so late in the game that I barely used them. Other cyberware upgrades, like a leg modification that gives you a double-jump, were so expensive that I'd have to opt to take on side jobs just to afford them, though this becomes easier later in the game when those gigs have bigger payouts.In fact, most nice things in Night City are prohibitively expensive, and I found that money was often the only obstacle when it came to progression. Granted, I was playing Cyberpunk on a tight deadline, so I couldn't spend much time doing odd jobs. But there is a ridiculous amount of stuff to buy and seemingly endless moneymaking jobs to take on. There's even a whole section in your quest journal dedicated to all the cars people have offered to sell you--though you start the game with a car, and I got multiple free vehicles for completing side quests, so I never bought a car and couldn't find a real reason to.That's emblematic of the world of Cyberpunk 2077. It is so full of things to buy, to do, to see, and yet so much of it doesn't feel essential. Night City is massive, and while you can fast travel from specific points, you'll often need to walk or drive a bit to your destination. I started to compare prices from one ripperdoc to the next--they're how you upgrade your oh-so expensive cyberware--but stopped after the third because I didn't want to drag myself across the city all day. I went clothing shopping only once for the same reason, and I'd managed to loot more than one cute outfit off of corpses anyway. There's even an entire crafting and item upgrade menu that I never actually needed to use, given that I was regularly looting better gear and items off my numerous enemies; at least in my playthrough, I had no reason to engage with these systems at all.Night City is beautiful and vile. The architecture is often stunning, and some of my favorite sections of the game were when I drove from one district to the next, radio turned up, taking in all the neon lights and monolithic megabuildings piercing the sky. Then I'd get out of the car and hear one of the oft-repeated advertisements blaring out onto the street and quickly snap out of the reverie of driving. There's one ad that's just a man making a long, exaggerated orgasm sound that tended to pierce through any conversation I was having.It's a tough world and a hard one to exist in, by design; with no apparent purpose and context to that experience, all you're left with is the unpleasantness.The ads are one of many, many aesthetic choices in Cyberpunk 2077 that are grating with no real point. There's one ad in particular that was the topic of much discussion pre-release; it features a feminine person with a giant, exaggerated, veiny erection in their leotard and advertises a drink called Chromanticore with the tagline ""mix it up."" It is everywhere. And while the ""purpose"" of it may be to show what a sex-obsessed, superficial, exploitative place Night City is, there's nothing in the main story or any of the side quests I did that gives it even that much context--I found just one message on one of the many computers I logged into that commented on how low-brow Night City culture is. The result is that there's a fetishization of trans people at every turn, in a game with only one very minor trans character (that I found, at least) and no way to play as an authentically trans character yourself.I found and read tons of text logs, scoured people's private messages, listened to radio and TV programs and random NPC conversations, and I struggled to find justifications for many of Cyberpunk's more questionable and superficial worldbuilding choices. It's a world where megacorporations rule people's lives, where inequality runs rampant, and where violence is a fact of life, but I found very little in the main story, side quests, or environment that explores any of these topics. It's a tough world and a hard one to exist in, by design; with no apparent purpose and context to that experience, all you're left with is the unpleasantness.There are instances where the game does start to do more with an initially superficial choice, but these threads are often dropped quickly. For example, in the pen-and-paper game, the Voodoo Boys were a group of mostly white men who used ""voodoo"" stereotypes to scare people. In 2077, they are a group of Haitian people displaced by natural disaster (by my interpretation, one caused by climate change). At one point in the main story, you can ask a Voodoo Boys member what the name is about, given they don't actually do anything associated with ""voodoo""; he tells you to ask the people that call them that and refuses to tell you what they call themselves. There's a seed of an interesting idea here--the labels given to the ""other,"" diaspora, the trauma of losing your home--but none of this is ever explored again in the main story as I played it, nor in any of the many side quests I played, either. I didn't find another opportunity to interact with the Voodoo Boys at all.There's so much to cover that I can't possibly touch on everything, but my experience is that there are aspects of the game that feel lost in translation, invoking cultures that aren't adequately explored or contextualized. Characters in one side quest use the word ""ofrenda"" as if it means ""funeral"" when it's actually a particular kind of altar primarily for Day of the Dead--it's unclear to me if this is a translation issue or an overall misunderstanding of Mexican customs, since you do put together an altar during the event that's being called ""the ofrenda."" As another example, you can go to a clothing store in Japantown and buy ""yukata"" that are just wrap shirts bearing only the slightest resemblance to real yukata. It's not that Cyberpunk always gets everything wrong in its incorporation of a variety of cultures and backgrounds but that the world is so big and unruly that I never knew what I would find around any corner or if I'd understand what the intent behind it was--I just grew to accept that whatever I did find, at least in terms of setting and worldbuilding, would likely be superficial.That's the case for the world overall and its background characters, anyway. You meet a lot of people in Night City, many of whom die in your wake like you're some sort of curse, while others just call from time to time with a job for you to do. The few that don't die and have proper arcs make up V's friends and love interests, and these are the characters that rightfully stand out.The first is Panam Palmer, who wins the award for the best name in the game. She's a rough-around-the-edges type of girl trying to make her own way in Night City and leaving her Nomad family behind in the process. This was the one instance where I felt my Nomad lifepath actually enhanced the experience--by choosing the Nomad-related responses, I actually felt like I was bonding with Panam over our similar backgrounds. Her quests are often fun, poorly thought-out heists, and by the end, I really did feel like I'd made V a lifelong friend who would drop everything to help her out.My favorite character, though, is Judy Alvarez, an earnest, hot-tempered, beautifully human character with the best arc in the game. She edits braindances, which are kind of like VR movies where you can acutely feel the recorder's emotions (and they're often used for porn). Judy is an incredibly gifted BD editor, and she's also a member of the Moxes, a gang of sex workers that look out for one another. Judy's story unfolds thanks to her fierce and endless desire to fight for her friends, which leads to some of the most interesting quests in the game--and some of the only ones that give you the ability to properly fight back against such a bleak, exploitative world. The final section of Judy's arc was my favorite in the entire game. It's a quiet respite from the lights and sounds of the city, an intimate look into the soul of her character, and provided you meet the requirements, contains the only sex scene I saw that didn't make me want to die on the spot.Romance doesn't play a major role in Cyberpunk, at least in what I saw and played, but you can sleep with sex workers and the occasional random NPC--although I wouldn't recommend it. The sex scenes are all POV-style to fit with the game's first-person perspective, and they are awkward. One was so awful that I actually rolled back my save and told the guy I'd rather be friends instead. He took it like a champ.Legendary rockerboy Johnny Silverhand is with you for the vast majority of the game, showing up in pretty much every mission to try to influence your decisions, make snide remarks, or just kick back on a bed in the background while you talk to someone. His relationship with V is often antagonistic, sometimes playfully so, and other times outright hostile.Johnny is, simply put, an asshole. It's a testament to Keanu Reeves' performance that I actually liked him. He treated his friends badly and women worse. As dialogue options routinely point out, he may or may not qualify as a terrorist; before he died in 2023, he planted a nuke inside Arasaka Tower, an attack against corporate imperialism that ended up killing a lot of people and an important event in the original tabletop game. He's the kind of guy who gets away with far too much, and based on what I learned about him throughout the game, I'm surprised he died at the hands of Adam Smasher rather than by choking on his own vomit after a bender.Johnny is, simply put, an asshole. It's a testament to Keanu Reeves' performance that I actually liked him.Reeves is somehow able to make all of this interesting and kind of charming rather than extremely off-putting. For the most part, Johnny is a well-written character in that I was always curious to hear what he had to say and how he interpreted the situations we were in--I was never quite sure if his advice was any good or if his opinions had any merit, but I wanted to hear him out every time. It's Reeves' delivery of these lines, which often involve Johnny chastising you for something or other, that really sells the ""lovable jerk"" vibe that I would normally find overplayed.The push-and-pull of Johnny's opinions and your own adds a lot of color to even run-of-the-mill missions. At one point I didn't heed Johnny's condescending warnings and accepted a deal from a character who ended up tricking me, which also resulted in a lot of people dying (oops); another time, I pursued a side quest only because he practically begged me to do it, saying it was the most interesting thing we'd stumbled upon in a long time (and it did end up being unlike anything else in the game). The dynamic is compelling and left me on my toes, always wondering if I should listen to Johnny or follow my initial instincts.I'm not sure if there were necessarily any completely right or wrong choices in a lot of those missions, but Johnny's presence, and the ambiguity it brings, is supposed to have an effect on V's psyche, for better or for worse--it's a factor of the circumstances that put him in V's head in the first place. That Johnny could affect my decision-making, as well as how I interpreted each interaction, is a clever way to convey that.Aside from character highlights, side quests are far and away the best part of the game. Like the rogue taxi one I mentioned at the beginning of this review, there are quite a few clever, interesting, goofy, and sad side quests that I really enjoyed. On a gameplay level, they often provide a nice change of pace from the more combat-focused main story; sometimes you just talk to people, while a more involved one has you doing favors for Johnny since he's, you know, technically dead.One especially intriguing side quest had me playing detective, investigating a mysterious break-in at the apartment of a Night City mayoral candidate. Mechanically, it's a simple open-world ""use your ability to highlight clues"" gimmick, but what follows is a fascinating and kind of creepy look at Night City corruption, gaslighting, and whether it's better to tell someone the truth if it means it could get them killed. Conversely, I also did a really silly quest that involved a clown man with a grenade for a nose that had no point but was delightful in a weird way.Side quests amounted to around 30 hours of my total playtime, and they were what propelled me through. While not every one lands, there are some that feel essential in a way that very little else in the game does. These include Judy's story arc and the taxi excursion as well as a much shorter story about a depressed man who lives in V's apartment building. Even on the tight review deadline, I kept finding myself seeking out just one more side quest before bed just because I was eager to see what I would find.All that said, when I finished the game, I felt empty. All the friends I had made, what I learned about Johnny, the way I developed my V as a character--much of it didn't seem to matter. Making friends in a lonely, sad city doesn't affect the urgency of V's main quest, and it doesn't seem to affect her priorities related to it. Discovering a police-sponsored murder coverup or the depths of corporate control of Night City life doesn't seem to change V's ambitions to be remembered as a legendary Night City merc. Falling in love didn't even give my V what she wanted.I got a lot out of the side quests and some of the characters, but I got very little out of the overall story.I don't quite understand the ending I got, but it made me sad. It didn't reflect the V I felt I'd developed, one who helped her friends and followed her curiosity. Worst of all, I have no idea what Cyberpunk 2077 is even trying to say. There's an overall theme of identity that is dashed by the dissonance between the V you actually play and the V you get in the end; otherwise, I couldn't tell you what Cyberpunk is trying to do with its beautifully grotesque world. I got a lot out of the side quests and some of the characters, but I got very little out of the overall story.It also bears a mention: Cyberpunk 2077 is phenomenally buggy. I played a pre-release build that was updated during the review period, and there's a day-one patch planned as well, but the scale of technical issues is too large to reasonably expect immediate fixes. I encountered some kind of bug on every mission I went on, from more common, funnier ones like characters randomly T-posing to several complete crashes. I didn't notice much of an improvement after the update, either. In a very late-game, very important fight, the game froze on me--twice. I ended up taking a break out of frustration before attempting, and finally succeeding, the third time.These bugs, more than any game I've played in years, took me out of the experience often. Non-interactable items like cardboard boxes will explode when you interact with something next to them; UI elements will stay on-screen long after they're meant to, which is only solved by reloading a save; characters will interrupt themselves during proper dialogue sequences by repeating a throwaway line they'd say in the overworld, seriously disrupting key moments; I died once and, upon reloading my last save, found my hacking ability no longer worked, forcing me to roll back to an autosave 10 minutes prior. The list is extensive.The technical problems not only took me out of the game literally but also led me to question whether certain things throughout the game were intentional. It often took me a moment or two to determine whether a visual glitch was supposed to be happening due to V's cyberware, which is a major part of the story, or if I needed to reload the game. There were a few instances where I couldn't tell if dialogue or an event had been skipped due to a bug or by design, since there are times where the game will skip you ahead in time as part of a scene. I also found some exploration sequences frustrating because it was incredibly hard to tell if I was just missing the clue I was supposed to find or if it hadn't popped up at all, and I ended up leaving areas and coming back later on multiple occasions out of confusion and frustration. At least once, I didn't get a dialogue hint indicating what to do until I left the area and came back.I was playing on a gaming laptop well above the minimum specs announced for Cyberpunk 2077, while another GameSpot player experienced the same severity and frequency of bugs (though no hard crashes) on an even higher-end desktop PC. Your mileage may vary, but in our experience, the bugs are obtrusive and substantial across the board, often forcing us to reload saves or exit the game entirely. It's hard to get really into a world you constantly have to leave.But then it's hard to get into Cyberpunk 2077's world in general. So much of it is superficial set dressing, and there's so much happening all around you--ads going off at all times, gunfights breaking out in the streets, texts coming in about cars you'll never buy--that a lot of the game feels superfluous. The side quests and the characters they showcase are the shining beacon through the neon-soaked bleakness of Night City, and they give you room to explore the best the core RPG mechanics have to offer. These are what carried me through an otherwise disappointing experience.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"
Cyberpunk 2077,Riley MacLeod,Kotaku,https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-the-kotaku-review-1845946628,"It’s been two weeks since Cyberpunk 2077 officially released. In my initial impressions, I wrote that I was ready for everyone—developer CD Projekt Red, the studio’s PR people, fans—to stop talking about the game and just let me play it. I’ve been playing steadily since before launch, but weeks later, it feels like there’s barely room in the conversation to talk about the game itself.Of course, talking about what’s inside Cyberpunk is hard if you can’t stomach its content, can’t play it for your physical health, or can’t make it work on your console. After a long cycle of pre-release hype, social media missteps, and crunch, Cyberpunk freefell out of the gate by giving one journalist a seizure. Its post-release life has been about the game’s poor performance on consoles, so rife with bugs and crashes that CDPR offered refunds. This declaration basically amounted to the studio simply saying players could refund it, leading to console-makers and retail stores taking matters into their own hands. In addition to offering refunds, Sony took the extreme step of removing the game from the PlayStation store altogether. Many people who could actually run the game were disappointed by its lack of promised features and how little it resembled what CDPR had spent years promoting. Meetings between CDPR management and investors and management and staff suggest a mishandled project, a host of unrealistic expectations, and something between willful ignorance and intentional deception to hide the game’s abysmal state.Meanwhile, the conversation about the game went just as disastrously as the game’s launch. Some fans bombarded reviewers with hate and harassment for giving the game low scores or for pointing out it gave them a seizure, then changed their tune post-release to bombard reviewers with hate and harassment for scoring it too high. Some fans, and even critics, felt the press were complicit with CDPR in hiding the game’s poor performance. (From what I could see, the hiding was very much done by the publisher. CDPR only offered the better-performing PC version for review, and restricted when reviewers could show their own video; while the lack of console code certainly made us at Kotaku wonder what was up, no reviewer that I know of had any special insight into the console version, nor did CDPR seem to impose any restrictions that would prevent a reviewer from giving their honest assessment of the game or talking about its bugs.)Despite all of this, I kept playing Cyberpunk after I published my impressions. I’ve got over 60 hours in it now; I keep drifting back to it, alongside those players still doggedly posting gameplay memes on Reddit and all those hardworking guides and tips writers trying to treat Cyberpunk like any other video game. I’ve got a long list of stories I’d like to write about it: neat sidequests I’ve done, interesting things that have happened to me, thoughts on how the game thinks about issues I care about, such as the environment and food. But it’s always felt tone deaf to talk about Cyberpunk with so much controversy swirling around it, and with so many players unable to play it at all. Every time I think “I’d like to write about Cyberpunk today,” the monkey’s paw curls into some new, terrible contortion.$70 off these best-in-class wireless headphonesGizmodo reviewed them and declared them to be “annoyingly incredible.""(This review contains mild spoilers for how Cyberpunk’s ending works.)Here’s a pretty telling snapshot of what playing Cyberpunk has been like for me. Last weekend, I did a sidequest about autonomous cars. I made my way through a malfunctioning (purposefully, as intended by the game code) autonomous car factory. I hacked into computers to read emails about the company’s human workers losing their jobs, enjoying the rich worldbuilding Cyberpunk largely consigns to its margins. I short-circuited enemy robots with my cyberware hacks, a repetitive but satisfying way around obstacles. As I progressed, it became apparent that I would have a choice to make at the end of this quest, one made complicated by what I’d learned about the cars during an earlier storyline. It was a well-written quest with an interesting choice at its core, and I was both eager and anxious to get to its end. But I had another obstacle to navigate besides the enemy drones and my own conscience: The doors on one side of the factory were glitched (unintentionally, a problem with the game code), and instead of leading to hallways they led to the gaping chasm of the underside of the map. I couldn’t pass through them without falling to my death. I was able to work around it until the end of the quest, when I found myself one attribute point shy of being able to select the choice I wanted to. I considered leaving the area, leveling up, and coming back, but the unintentionally broken doors made me doubt I could. I picked a less savory choice. Keanu Reeves called me “a real piece of shit.” I got a vehicle for my trouble, drove it politely out of the factory, and have yet to drive it again because of how badly it handles. I read a guide that says the different outcomes aren’t all that different anyway.On my PC, beefed up specifically for the game, Cyberpunk performs OK. I can work around the technical failings and laugh at or even admire the bugs. It’s only crashed once, hilariously, when another car hit me so hard the whole game mysteriously shut down. So I’m not playing the broken mess we’re all talking about. Instead, I’m playing a game whose various pieces don’t fit together, where busyness and choices feel like illusions to cover up its emptiness, where key features like driving and gunplay are a chore. I leave each play session a little befuddled and dissatisfied, but then I read about a quest or see a video of an unfamiliar area and boot the game up again. I can’t quite say if I like it, even though saying things like that is part of my job. I’m still playing it, but I’m not always sure why.In my impressions, I reviewed each piece of the game separately, evaluating its plot, gameplay, systems, and world on their own. After getting through the main plot and several of the game’s possible endings, Cyberpunk still feels like a bunch of separate pieces that, as one of my colleagues framed it, feel held together through sheer force of will. Some pieces shine: Night City might be mostly a facade of vanishing non-player-characters, empty storefronts, and senseless traffic patterns, but it’s thoughtfully crafted and enticing to explore. Much of my time in the game has been spent just driving for miles, admiring how naturally a busy commercial hub becomes an imposing corporate center becomes a run-down residential neighborhood becomes abandoned outskirts. I can’t get enough of the TV shows, books, and ads; I recently spent 10 minutes watching a talk show on a television in a random food stall, where a therapist and the blue-haired host argued about the causes of cyberpsychosis. A sidequest contained a snippet of fan fiction about Johnny Silverhand’s band Samurai that I actually squealed in delight over. All the background information paints a richer, more intentional world than you encounter just by playing the game. While this bothered me when I first started playing, I love it now. It feels like secrets stashed away for me to find, the detailed world the game’s marketing promised showing up only when I make the time to look.“In Night City you can become anyone, as long as you don’t mind not wearing pants.”RPG--no, action adventure game--no, cyberpunk metaphorExploring Night City, excellent lore and world-building, some interesting charactersUninteresting combat, lack of meaningful choices, poor handling of topics like gender, sex, and raceCD Projekt RedPC (played), PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox X/S, StadiaDecember 10, 202064 hours by the in-game counter; played through two of the possible endings and two of the epiloguesI also, despite myself, grew to love Keanu Reeves as Johnny. The plot’s “point of no return”—the moment at which you’re shuttled to the end—came sooner than I expected, after a bunch of main story quests that were exciting but never deep enough to really grab me. Your ending options change based on relationships you forge and choices you make, leading to a few branching scenarios and epilogues, after which you’re dropped back into the game right before the final mission, which you can replay if you want. The whole game is technically about what to do about sharing your brain with the digital ghost of Johnny, but I only started appreciating him after the epilogues I saw changed our relationship. In the post-game, where he’s no longer a narrative ticking clock, I’ve come to enjoy his company. I like when he shows up physically, unlike the host of other characters who never stop calling me on the phone. His hamfisted anti-corporate talk and dreaming of his glory days as a rebel rocker felt pretentious for a long time, but now I just think fondly, “Whatever, old man.” He’s more sad than he is cool, but what we’ve gone through together gives him depth. I’ve gotten a few items related to him through sidequests, and I keep wearing them even though I’ve found better gear. I can even bring myself to sometimes drive his car.Other parts of Cyberpunk work on their own but not within the game. Now that I’m through the plot, the upgrades and perks that once intimidated me feel like the systems of a much longer game, one that would require you to prepare for a dramatic final showdown or give you bigger late-game challenges. I’ve maxed out my street cred, but I don’t need the better weapons the stat unlocks. The high-level guns I have do a lot of damage, but I don’t think upgrading them further will make fights less basic or less time- and bullet-consuming. The perks at the far ends of the skill trees sound cool, but I’m pursuing them more out of curiosity than a real sense of need. There’s no reason to put points into stats that give me different quest options if most of the quests end up the same. My expensive double-jumping cyberlegs haven’t unlocked any worthwhile new areas. The weapons, character enhancements, and leveling system are all good on their own, but they feel like they would be better used in a game with a longer story, more nuanced combat, or a different difficulty curve.Other parts of the game just don’t work at all. Cyberpunk never departs from its crass sexualization or un-nuanced views of race; as cool as its world can be, it’s always a little off-putting. For all protagonist V is meant to be a criminal trying to make his way in Night City, he can side with corporations and cops as easily as gangs and fixers, making whatever anti-establishment sentiments the game professes to explore feel hollow. The complex character creator is mostly for show. My nomad background never came into play in a meaningful way. Even the different endings seem less like naturally-occurring results and more like hitting the right boxes on a checklist. There are several boss battles that I found tedious, against characters I didn’t care about whose only interesting moves were that they could heal themselves. I’ve mostly just crafted ammo, since the game’s enemies require so much of it. None of the rest of the crafting has felt necessary; it also seems like, until recently, too much crafting could break your saves.I don’t know the story of Cyberpunk’s development, but when I play I catch hints of what feels like frustrated intentions everywhere. There are so many places where the game feels like it was meant to be something else: areas meant to have content, choices that could have mattered, features that could have been more necessary. Besides not meeting my hopes of how it could have been great, the game also doesn’t diverge from my fears about how it’d fall short. Its worst parts are exactly what some of its pre-release talking points suggested they’d be: regressive about race and gender despite so many opportunities to correct course, a cyberpunk veneer that’s made its most substantial point in how the game itself demonstrates how corporations like the one that made it behave. It’s hard to play this game without constantly wondering: Why is it like this? What happened during these past eight years?I assume CDPR will keep releasing patches to fix some of the game’s problems, making Cyberpunk run on last-gen consoles and letting more players actually play. I don’t know whether the developers will fix its other problems, overhauling the combat, customization, AI, driving, wanted system, and all the other parts many players are disappointed in.I’m torn. I want to play the game that it seems like the hundreds of people who worked so hard on it intended to make. I want them to turn Cyberpunk’s disastrous launch into something they can be proud of. But I’d also feel OK if the studio’s management learned some lessons from the whole thing, gave the developers a well-deserved break, and tried to do better with a new project. I don’t know if the conversation around the game will be some kind of breaking point, or just the latest triple-A game controversy we all yell about until another one shows up.My favorite ending in Cyberpunk is the one a lot of players call the “bad” ending. I wouldn’t have been satisfied if it were my only choice, but its sad but uncompromising tone felt right for my playthrough. In every ending, characters you forged relationships with message you during the credits. In this ending, they have different opinions on your choice, and some wish things came out differently. This ending felt most like my time inside Cyberpunk and in the discussion around it: a lot of conflicting emotions and no definitive answer. "

Paul Tamburro 
Cyberpunk 2077 review for PC. Cyberpunk 2077 is not what CD Projekt Red wanted it to be. Never before has a game so clearly defined the over-ambitiousness of the gaming industry, with it so laboriously stuffed with content that it’s quite literally bursting at the seams. Everywhere you look in Night City there’s evidence of a project gone awry, from the mountain of glitches and performance issues, through to poorly implemented features like crafting and leveling. It is a game where you can read a log entry about a company working its staff to the bone for little reward, then hop onto a motorcycle that causes your player-character, V, to T-pose with their pants off.Cyberpunk 2077 has been released, but it’s not yet ready to be played. Even on PC, which is the version of the game being reviewed here and is superior to the disastrous PS4 and Xbox One versions in every way, it’s clear that it is unfinished. My first steps in Night City were not spent admiring its towering skyscrapers or bustling streets, but rather excessively tinkering with the settings to get it to run adequately.Even after working to achieve serviceable performance on an RTX 2070 Super, various inexplicable issues would routinely arise to remind me of its troubled development. My health meter would suddenly stop working, the mini-map would send me in the wrong direction, or an important boss fight would be brought to a halt by said boss becoming stuck in thin air. While I never experienced a hard crash or game-breaking bugs during my playtime and all of the more egregious bugs resolved themselves in time, it was impossible to be feel immersed in its world when so much was breaking around me.Rarely has a game been so at odds with its setting as Cyberpunk 2077 is with its story of rebellion in a capitalist dystopia. With the context of CD Projekt Red’s widely-reported crunching practices, its anti-corporate message feels inauthentic. It is as punk as John Lydon doing a butter commercial. Though we’re often asked to “separate art from the artist,” it is difficult to believe in Cyberpunk‘s message when it is so at odds with what’s been reported about its development cycle.This inauthenticity stretches to the customization options offered to you, which struggle to let you become one of Night City’s enhancement-obsessed populace. You’re locked into one of just two body types and gender options from the outset, a smattering of cosmetic-only cybernetic enhancements, and appearance choices that won’t make your V look too different from everyone else’s. Considering that the game’s marketing informs would-be players that ‘Night City Changes Every Body,’ you can’t even get a haircut. Aside from your clothing, your V will look the same at the start of the game as they do at the end, but you can choose between two penises so at least there’s that.You’re asked to choose a Lifepath, a seemingly major choice that I figured would have a big impact on the rest of the game. Out of Nomad, Streetkid, and Corpo, I opted for the latter, assuming that being directly involved in Night City’s seedy corporations would allow me to experience a riches-to-rags story and see both sides of the coin. Instead, a brief prologue led to a montage summarizing six months of important story detail, as my Corpo background became nothing more than the occasional ineffectual dialog option.So much of Cyberpunk 2077 feels like the beginnings of a great idea left by the wayside to meet an arbitrary deadline. Its leveling system is intricately detailed, allowing you to increase individual core stats like Body, Reflexes, and Cool, and then dive in deeper with perk points that let you tweak V as you see fit. However, points are handed out sparingly, and the stats mostly feel inconsequential given that they only add marginal improvements to your character. Crafting is also a glaring oversight, with you able to upgrade each gun, equip fun mods, or even make new weapons from scratch, but then it’s in no way vital outside of occasionally needing to craft ammo.Considering the lengthy period of time between its announcement and release, the whole experience bleeds disappointment. This is made even more frustrating by the multiple signs that a great game is to be found in the wreckage. Not just a great game, in fact, but a terrific one — when the stars align and Cyberpunk 2077 works as intended, there’s nothing else quite like it, and it’s all thanks to Night City.Night City isn’t your typical sprawling-yet-barren game world where you do little more than travel between objectives — there are always secrets to unearth if you take the time to stop and smell the oil-covered roses. Taking a seat at a diner could result in you being caught up in an impromptu robbery, while going for a stroll beneath the freeway can end up in a guided meditation session with a mysterious Buddhist. Night City is so much more than just nice scenery you can stop to stare at between waypoints, and my curiosity was always rewarded.When at its best, Cyberpunk 2077 had me naturally finding myself at the center of unexpected chaos. In one brief period of time, I was tasked with trying to calm an uneasy AI taxi cab that had gone rogue, before I stumbled upon a mini-boss fight with a crazed construction worker who had been fitted into a giant exosuit. Then I traveled north, to nowhere in particular, and found the mountains of imposing oil rigs that fuel the beautiful, dangerous city V lives in. It is these moments that make Night City feel alive.However, despite building the most impressive open-world I’ve yet seen in a game, I was inexplicably encouraged to rush through Cyberpunk 2077‘s main story arc and overlook it all. By introducing a plot device that essentially makes V a ticking time bomb, I felt compelled to push through my main jobs and leave my side jobs behind. This is unfortunate, as while the main story is what drives the plot forward, the side jobs are what reveal the beating heart at the center of Night City.Side jobs will mostly see you working with characters you’re hurriedly introduced to in the main story. Not only do they help to give much-needed context to the overarching plot, but they also provide interesting stories in their own right. It’s reminiscent of Fallout: New Vegas, albeit with less player choice, where you take a detour from the main quest to embark on a winding adventure filled with surprises and colorful characters.The voice acting is almost universally excellent. V, portrayed by Cherami Leigh or Gavin Drea depending on whether you’ve opted for a female or male player-character, is the right mix of sympathetic and intimidating, keeping me locked in tight to the story even when the dialogue leaned a little too heavily into sci-fi convolution. Keanu Reeves, who surprisingly features heavily in the game, gets the worst deal when it comes to this. His character, the narcissistic rocker-turned-terrorist Johnny Silverhand, is forced to say more than a few lines that made me think of Harrison Ford’s comments on the Star Wars script: “You can type this shit, but you can’t say it.”While Reeves’ performance can be hit-and-miss — the Hollywood actor isn’t exactly known for his impressive range and it shows here — the rest of the cast help make Night City’s interweaving stories memorable. These side jobs also provide the player with the most choice, allowing you to make crucial decisions that are rarely presented to you in the main story.This is why the sense of urgency imparted on the player is so baffling. It’s fitting that Cyberpunk 2077 is based on Mike Pondsmith’s tabletop role-playing game of the same name, as it often felt like I was locked in a session with an impatient DM. Amid an ongoing information dump of names, locations, and objectives in Cyberpunk‘s prologue, I was hurriedly whisked through parts of the game I’d later learn were integral to my enjoyment of it.The most egregious example of this is cyberware. This is hastily revealed at the start of the game before becoming just another marker on the obscenely overstuffed map, yet unlocking new cybernetics to attach to V significantly improves its gunplay. Not only that, but the most fun cybernetics cost huge sums of money that can’t be obtained in any timely fashion. As gunfighting can be a chore, with weapons feeling clunky to handle while enemy AI is inconsistent, cyberware can dramatically increase the player’s enjoyment of it. So why is it so difficult to get?And that feels like Cyberpunk 2077 in a nutshell — a truly excellent game hidden beneath layers of poor choices. There’s so much here to love, yet between the copious bugs, performance issues, and it ushering the player away from its very best features, it gets lost in the rubble.When played on PC, Cyberpunk 2077 is still an impressive, engrossing, and fun RPG despite its flaws. However, assuming that CD Projekt Red sticks to its word and fixes its problems, it has all the potential to be a genuine classic of its genre. As such, it’s difficult to recommend playing it at its worst, when its best could be something special.Cyberpunk 2077 reviewed on PC.

Cyberpunk 2077,Chris Carter,Destructoid,https://www.destructoid.com/stories/review-cyberpunk-2077-612799.phtml,"darkCD Projekt Red has the benefit of releasing a major game once in a blue moon to a roaring applause.I was hooked from the very first Witcher (which is frankly still some of their best narrative work), and continued on through Geralt’s journey into card game-dom. Now, we’re fast-forwarding that old fantasy timeline quite a bit with Cyberpunk 2077.While it’s more than adequate at giving us a general look at a dystopian techno-future, a lot of the details are muddled.Cyberpunk 2077 (PC [reviewed], PS4, PS5, Stadia, Xbox One, Xbox Series X)Developer: CD Projekt RedPublisher: CD Projekt RedReleased: December 10, 2020MSRP: $59.99The last time we spoke in my review in progress, I was enjoying the side content and the general feel of Night City more than the actual campaign. Nothing has changed since then.Without giving away too much, your avatar (named “V”) busts into Night City and tries to make a name for themselves as a hustler and odd-job-taker. Very quickly (I’m talking a few hours in) you get wrapped up in a socio-economic plotline involving some of the biggest names in the city, and become mentally entwined with Johnny Silverhand (Keanu Reeves) via technical wizardry. Johnny is pretty much present for the entire shebang as a Great Gazoo figure (he does basically call you “dumb dumb” a lot!), and for the most part, appears randomly and taunts you: eventually you start to learn more about his story and forge your own.It…works until it doesn’t. Again, a lot of the meat of Cyberpunk is found in the cracks between the main questline. Many supporting characters have a compelling story to tell; you just need to coax it out of them through optional missions, because the critical path really isn’t going to deliver on that front. In some sections it feels cobbled together and rushed, quickly dispensing lore dumps and then whisking you out of a fixed location.Some campaign quests have this really obvious “massive cut” that amounts to a short load screen when you’re just at the apex of something exciting. Either it’ll knock you out with an errant blow to the head, or you’ll get a jarring load screen that will transport you to an entirely different location. It’s all meant to be stylized, but in some instances, it feels like the team just wasn’t sure how to end a sequence.The sidequests on the other hand aren’t afraid to get weirder. In fact, I spent a lot of time embarking upon these oddities thinking “why weren’t these just campaign missions?” Some of the most meaningful dialogue, character growth, and interpersonal relationships are buried within these quests that a lot of people will never see (which is why I’m glad I took my time with this review). It’s almost like these portions of the game were designed by a different team; or hungrier, more junior developers. That lack of polish also applies to the RPG elements; which might be one of the most disappointing pieces of the package given that this is based on a tabletop RPG.Loot and inventory management can be a mess, often resulting in chasing menial stat-boosts that barely impact gameplay in any meaningful fashion. Crafting similarly feels like a complete afterthought, as do many of the “plus stat” skill-up perks that you’ll apply between leveling. Depending on your build you’ll either gain completely new abilities, or a few stat points here and there. At first glance Cyberpunk 2077 seems to have expansive skill tree and crafting systems, but they’re only skin deep.The main strength of Cyberpunk 2077 is the joy found in stomping around the open world. It can feel sterile at times (particularly with some gaunt and lifeless NPCs), but when something randomly pops up (like a new building, sidequest, or open world event), it’s fun to just hang out. That counts for a whole lot in a game like this, and was one of the best parts of Witcher III. In fact, it saved the game for me from descending into “okay” territory. On PC, when the game isn’t bugging out, Night City can look beautiful and imposing. I’m still going to be aimlessly trekking through it for the foreseeable future.So at the time of the review-in-progress last week I didn’t have any major bugs to report; but lo and behold I came across some, even with the day-one patch. Most of what I experienced are minor visual and AI issues, including cases like this one right here: where the vehicle on the right flipped out and whirlwinded around like the Tasmanian Devil. But there’s stuff that’s more severe than that. Another bug killed me after opening up an elevator shaft door (I assume the physics system sprang it into my body at 1000x the force required and did enough damage to take me out), resulting in 10 minutes of lost progress during a relatively low-key walking sequence.In one instance, loading a save didn’t spawn the enemies required to actually finish a mission: putting me in an endless loop. In true Ubisoft fashion, I was saved by the constant auto-save system, which brought me back to an earlier checkpoint. Oh, I also crashed out twice and lost around 10 minutes of progress each time. Note that you cannot save in combat, nor can you save during an in-game cutscene: so if you feel a crash coming, sometimes you can’t do anything about it. At most, I lost around 45 minutes of progress that I can live with, and dealt with some easily-bested glitched AI and a few wonky visual effects. It’s not the end of the world, but the lack of polish is so obvious, even on PC (which is arguably the most stable platform of them all).Cyberpunk 2077 is a victim of bloat, but you can choose to ignore a lot of it and take in the sights. That’s where Night City is at its best, and I sincerely suggest that you take your time going through it, as rushing will only lead to disappointment. Even just strolling through though, you’ll probably be left wanting more.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]GoodSolid and definitely has an audience. There could be some hard-to-ignore faults, but the experience is fun.

Cyberpunk 2077,Josh Hawkins,Shacknews,https://www.shacknews.com/article/121967/cyberpunk-2077-review-glitch-in-the-matrix,"New to Shacknews? Signup for a Free AccountAlready have an account? Login NowAfter several delays and years of development, Cyberpunk 2077 is finally here. Does it deliver on all the promises or does Night City leave people wanting more?Night City, built on the backs of dreamers and bathed in the light of the neon signs that litter the streets. The bright lights are beautiful in the dark of night, almost hiding the scars beneath. But, as the sun rises over the horizon, the dirt and cracks in the surface begin to show. Such is the fate of Cyberpunk 2077. Ambitious. Beautiful. Broken. Cyberpunk 2077 is everything that I could have wanted from CD Projekt RED’s newest RPG. Unfortunately, the things worth loving and celebrating are buried under layers of game-breaking bugs and weird design choices.There’s a lot I want to say about Cyberpunk 2077. A lot that I want to digest and break down. But, as I sit here, it’s hard to sort through it all. There’s a lot that I love. A lot that I want to praise. There’s also a lot of bad. Things like game-breaking bugs and graphical issues with NPCs and characters within the world. I’ll do my best to avoid them, but beware of mild spoilers ahead.If you’re looking for a world full of great stories and side quests, then you’ve come to the right place. While the main storyline itself is extremely strong—the relationship between V and Johnny Silverhand is one that works well and builds off itself throughout—the side quests really help to make the world feel like a living, breathing place.Without giving too much away, the main storyline follows mercenary V as they try to make a name for themselves. Unfortunately, the big job that should have set them up for the future goes pear-shaped and V is soon stuck with Johnny Silverhand’s psyche in their head. To make matters worse, Silverhand is a bit of an anti-corporate terrorist and his influence quickly begins to manifest itself in V’s life.But the depth doesn’t end there. Every side quest in Cyberpunk 2077 offers its own narrative, and while they’re all separate from the main story quests, it all builds together and connects to unlock additional paths that players can follow in later missions of the main campaign. In fact, the amount of endings players have available at the end of the game is partially determined by the characters that they've met and the side quests that they've completed.It’s this weaving connection between the side stories and main storyline that really add to the depth of the world and the characters that you get to know throughout.Combat is another thing you’ll see yourself in quite a bit in Cyberpunk 2077. It works, but if you’re looking for super deep combat, you aren’t going to find it here. There are a couple of standout things—like the Cyberware upgrades you can pick up from Ripperdocs, which add the ability to slow down time or double jump. There are also plenty of weapons to choose from, including the deadly and iconic Mantis Blades, which sprout from your arms when equipped.Gunplay is fairly weak at first, with headshots feeling really unsatisfying until after you’ve managed to snag a few upgrades. Once upgraded, though, they start to feel more like headshots. So, if you’re looking for that sweet pop as an enemy’s head explodes, then you’re going to want to put points into that. If you want more out of combat then I definitely suggest putting more thought into the various skills and Cyberware that you can invest in, as they really help to make it feel less like a point, click, kill simulator.Which brings us to the class system. Unlike standard RPGs, which make you choose from preordained classes, Cyberpunk 2077 allows you to pick and choose the skills you want from five main categories. These categories can be combined together in any way that you want, allowing you to make a stealth hacker, a melee-focused stealth hacker, or whatever else you want to make by combining the various skills that you can unlock.The system is also extremely forgiving, as you can spend much of your time focusing on one attribute and then just shift your focus later as you continue to level up and unlock new attributes and skills. There’s also the option to respec—something most RPGs offer these days—though it is a bit costly.If exploration is more your thing, then Night City has plenty to offer there, too. While the world isn’t quite as awe-striking as the large open worlds that we’ve become accustomed to over the years, there is a lot of content packed into the alleyways and streets that make up the city.Side quests and other open world activities can be found all throughout the city and the Badlands that surround it, so there’s no worry about running out of things to do. There are plenty of clothing options and vehicles, which really lets you build your character’s fashion and style however you want. There is an armor system in place, though you can do away with most of that worry thanks to some of the subdermal Cyberware upgrades you can purchase from Ripperdocs.The voice acting is another great part of the puzzle, and while the celebrity spotlight falls on Keanu Reeves throughout much of the story, the real shining lights here are characters like Judy Alvarez, the voice actors for both male and female V, and the other supporting characters that appear. Compared to many of these other actors, Keanu’s performance can come off really stiff at times, though it does even out as you continue through the game.Some of my best moments in Cyberpunk 2077 have come from simply walking or driving through the world from one objective to the next. The conversations that NPCs have as you walk by, and the sheer volume of people moving around the city, helps to bring Night City to life. There are some not-so-great development choices with the traffic AI—like the fact that they aren’t coded to pass around stopped vehicles, instead just piling up and then despawning as you move the camera around—but these are less bugs and more strange development choices.The way that the NCPD spawns work is also questionable, with the NPC cops simply appearing near you instead of driving up or walking up like they do in other games. It is immersion-breaking, but as someone who played without getting the cops called on them that often, I never had to worry about it too much. It is still an issue, though, and one of many that are worth discussing.While Cyberpunk 2077 is beautiful, and both the main story and side story quests are strong, the game has a lot of weaknesses to account for, too. I personally didn't run into too many graphical issues, though I did experience other issues with the game. The 3080 in my rig took everything that the game had to throw at it and handled it exceptionally well, though I did notice some textures popping in during exploration, as well as NPCs and cars sometimes phasing through solid objects. I realize that not everyone is as lucky as I am in that regard, and even if you are, chances are you’re going to run into one of the many other issues plaguing Cyberpunk’s beautiful world.Throughout the 50+ hours I’ve spent in the game I’ve experienced a myriad of bugs. Some were simple, like having my clothes magically unequip themselves between missions. Others resulted in me being unable to reload my weapons or even shoot my weapons, forcing me to completely reload the last save file. Other game-breaking issues I encountered resulted in dialogue options not popping up when they should, causing me to miss some timed dialogue sequences, and even having mission triggers bug out and not pop up when they should have.The game, though an RPG, doesn't offer any real way to customize your character outside of clothing changes after you complete the initial character creation. This means you can't change your hair or change up any of your other facial appearance options. This is more preference than necessity, but as an RPG, you'd expect to have a way to change up how your character looks throughout the game. It's possible we'll see this added in a future update similar to The Witcher 3's barbershop system, but at the moment it doens't exist in-game.I love what Cyberpunk 2077 has to offer, but the sad truth of the matter is that CDPR pushed the game out before it was ready. Despite multiple delays, the game launched with a ton of issues. Ultimately, there’s a lot of good about Cyberpunk 2077, though it is buried under quite a bit of bad.If you’re excited about playing Cyberpunk 2077 for yourself, then I recommend giving it a few months. Let CDPR sort out some of the bigger issues and then give it a try. I’d love nothing more than to sit here and tell you that it’s a perfect game and that you won’t have any issues playing it. Sadly, that isn’t the case. In its current state, Cyberpunk 2077 has a strong story and world, but those strengths are weighed down by bad design decisions and bugs aplenty.This review is based on a PC copy of Cyberpunk 2077 provided by the publisher.

					Josh Hawkins posted a new article, Cyberpunk 2077 review: Glitch in the matrix 
					I do find it interesting that the game mechanics themselves don't really show up at all in your Pros/Cons lists.  They seem to just kind of exist for the purpose of the world and story whether you liked or disliked them in the review, with the brief exceptions of gunplay or random spawning cops.  RPGs, for me, live or die by them and the story so I'd like to know how you feel about the systems in the game and whether or not you think they are fun.				
					i can overlook the bugs like t-poses and floating items.  but for the life of me, i can't forgive 3 things with this game. 1. not a single tutorial on how inventory and cyberware + related mods and upgrades work or work together.  i get that most of it is self explanatory, but i spent an hour last night trying to figure out why i can't apply the cyberware stuff in my inventory to my actual character.   2. story lines that got cut.  the montage they showed of jackie and v living it up was in one of the trailers.  i thought we would actually get to play through it.  but it was literally the same montage in the game.  wtf? 3. NPCs recycle the the same 24 or so lines that have no context.  cops spawning behind you.  no ability to see or customize your character after the initial customization screen.  fuck, i think NBA2k gives you more character customization than this ""RPG"" game.   
					[deleted]				
					I agree. The montage was obviously intentional and serves as a way to get you to the real starting point in the game regardless of which life path you chose to start with.				
					It didn’t strike you odd how you are apparently meeting all these characters in the montage and then when you run into them in the open world you have dialogue options that make no sense?  Or how you run into fixers in the real world and they have a couple dialogue options that seem a bit out of place and then there’s nothing to do with them?  It really seems like you are already supposed to be established in the world but they just skipped over all of that because reasons.   				
					Interactions with characters outside of quests seems flaky at best outside of quests. It'll be interesting to see how different this game is in a year or so				
outside of quests 
					It's really confusing. I have no idea what I'm doing basically. 				
					Yeah the disconnected story and characters is really confusing and seems to really indicate that that montage was meant to be playable stories that got cut... like how talking to ripperdocs prompts conversations like you’ve met before or even had other conversations and even did stuff together.  It feels very disjointed and is extremely unfortunate.  And who the fuck is T-bug?  Like, I thought T-Bug was some AI for that combat tutorial but then nope, turns out she shows up like “yo what’s up good to see everyone” and I’m like “Whoa, you’re a real person!?”  It’s such a fucking shame.  I hope hope hope that they finish the game how they originally intended, some day.  				
					Yep, this really bothered me too. More of a reason for me to return it on PC and buy it again late fall 2021 to see if they somehow fix that. 				
					I’m still right at the beginning, but wasn’t T-bug the tutorial leader? In which case, you meet her first thing.				
					She is a netrunner. You don't generally deal with her in person and even when you do, they specifically call out that it's novel.				
					The montage feels like they couldn't figure out a tutorial. The opening 90 minuets of the game are not good at all.				
					The montage bit is one of the coolest things the game does, narratively.  Probably the single best thing it does honestly.  More games should do it.				
					Visually it was very cool but it felt like it was there to fill a gap in development.				
					Eh, I don't know where you'd get that idea.  Did they ever hint at that being a playable sequence or something?  Narratively it made perfect sense for them to montage-fast-forward through 6 months of game time so I'm not sure if I buy it.				
					And also that montage happens in real time, in-engine, no loading or pop in etc.  It's a technical marvel.  It obviously took way too much time/effort to be an afterthought or bandaid IMO.				
					It's not that it's a horrible bad thing, it just feels like ""we couldn't figure out a gentle way to get you in this game world, so how's about we just throw you in the middle of it and next mission we give you a USB chip with a training module in it!"" It felt mediocre to me				
					Hahahahhahaha no, fuck no. It’s jarring laziness to use a marketing video as a montage to merge three different starting stories.It would be better to cut the 3 life path parts and make one good tutorial area that can be skipped if you want. If you skip the tutorial then you get to watch that marketing video montage, that you do daffly claim is amazing.				
					I was impressed technically since it was all in-engine. And that my character in the mirror actually looked better than the in-game ones, it was wild and made no sense why the game itself cannot do that.  I don't know how they did all that jumping around to many different scenes seamlessly and without any hiccups.  I would say all that stuff in there could make for an interesting DLC expansion instead of the standard post-game stuff. 				
					I was pretty unimpressed with the opening 90 minutes of the game but I was impressed with the AA in the game.     I'm on a 1080p TV and the last 6 months have had me terrified that my standards have risen and I can see jaggies.         I've noticed a lot lately and been really worried I'm slowly going to turn on my TV. Anyhow between Astrobot and CP2077 it seems very obvious to me that the scaler chip in the PS5 is nice.   Edges are smooth as hell.    So it's clear to me now, both Witcher 3 and GTAV just don't have AA or don't have good AA.  They look like shit for jaggies and pixelation.  
					Cyberpunk 2077 has TAA forced on by default on PC, there isn't even an option in-game to disable it, which is quite rare. I'm sure the console versions are using the same AA method there.GTAV & Witcher 3 are FXAA or SMAA or some other inferior post-process AA method, pre widespread adoption of TAA. That is why they are jaggy as hell. Only real fix on PC is supersampling/downsampling from a higher res. GTAV on PC does have an optional early form of nvidia specific temporal anti-aliasing (TXAA), but it's not nearly as good as modern methods. GTAV also has standard MSAA option that doesn't touch transparencies and kills perf as nearly as much as supersampling.The downside of TAA in Cyberpunk 2077 is still there in a slightly softer and slightly blurry final image, but they do a have a small amount of post-sharpening included which helps. You really only need to add more on PC if using DLSS which can introduce even more blur depending on the setting.				
					That's a good point, to be honest. When I was trying to write this review, it was really tough to put my thoughts down and make it all make sense and feel concise, which probably resulted in some things slipping through or getting cut in the process. I wanted to touch on the things I loved about the game, but I also didn't want to breeze over the issues, because they are issues. More than happy to provide some additional context, though. Cyberware is a pretty interesting and cool system, but it definitely feels like it could be fleshed out more. As a whole it is just kind of there, and it works more as a second upgrade system than a real game-changer, at least in my opinion. I actually spent most of the game ignoring it because it just didn't feel that important to me. The advertisements put a HUGE emphasis on style and choosing your clothes and that just doesn't really feel like it's the case in the game itself. The clothing offers armor, which you need as you would in any other RPG. There is a Cyberware upgrade you can grab that removes a lot of this worry, but overall you'll probably spend a good bit of time trading out items for more armor and shit like that. If it's an upgrade, it's an upgrade. Driving is abysmal at first, but like any game with shitty driving (looking at you ubisoft) the driving does get easier over time. Doesn't make it better, but this also isn't a driving game, so wasn't really willing to knock it off for not offering a great driving experience right out the gate. The upgrade system can be a bit confusing, just because they've chosen these dumb names for the attributes. I had friends messaging me constantly asking what the difference between the sub-cats were, etc. There also appears to be one missing. Maybe DLC down the line? Dialogue feels better than any other game I've played, tbh, and you're gonna use it a lot here. You can literally walk away from 90% of the conversations (unless you're sitting down) which makes it really cool. Tired of listening to that one annoying NPC drone on and on about that job you need or accidentally chose the wrong dialogue option? NBD. Just turn and walk away. Crafting is cool, but another one of those things you can ignore if you want. I went through the entire main storyline and a good portion of the main side quests without touching it aside from upgrading one weapon and then crafting some ammo. Now, once you start putting upgrades into it, it probably becomes a lot more usable, but for the most part it just kind of exists if you want to use it. Let me know if there are any other mechanics or anything you have any other questions about. 				
					Crafting... Yeah they could make it a little more user friendly.  For me it was only really used early on to craft pistol ammo because I never had enough in the first couple hours of the game.  After that I pretty much never really used it.				
					Cool, yeah I was just mostly interested in that stuff and what you liked and didn't like about them.  Seems like overall it kinda comes out a wash although the dialog options being great is a huge plus in my book.  Thanks!				
					Yeah. It's a mixed bag. Definitely not the strongest RPG out there, I will admit. But it was a hell of a fun game and hit some of the right check marks. With a little love, it could be truly great. Honestly reminds me of the first Witcher game. Lot of good, but also some kind of weird stuff that didn't always seem to make the most sense/matter. Least that's my take.				
					I'm kind of surprised that I keep hearing no mentions of things related to facial expressions and body language tech in reviews. Maybe I just haven't been playing the right games lately but there are a lot of story missions where these things are incredibly well done and provide some of the most convincing emotion or behavior I've seen in any game I've played. It's not always consistent but when it works it's really, really good.				
					It's the only thing keeping coming back for more. I've very close to returning it on PC right now. I've got a 7700k 1080TI setup and can really only do 1080p to get 60FPS, and even at resolution some areas still turn into slide shows. BUT most of the dialog scenes are WONDERFUL like you are saying and FPS is locked at 60. It all makes me want to just return it, then pick it up again, on PS5 this Fall 2021, when I'll have a PS5 and the game will have a native PS5 version that will run 60FPS locked. 				
					Yeah, the body language and facial tech is definitely something worth praising. As mentioned in a previous comment above, there was a lot on my mind that I was trying to touch on in the review and some stuff just kind of slipped through the cracks.  It's been a really long week/weekend, ya'll.				
					i dunno, i feel the opposite.  the facial animations are pretty good with emoting, but when one of the detailed main NPCs talk, the mouth movements are off.  i feel like uncharted 4 and TOLU2 did better with animating speech during cutscenes. oh and when i told to random NPCs, their mouths don't even move.  lol				
					You're right about it being inconsistent. The NPCs are especially egregious if you take the time to actually go look at them and notice that 50% of the time their mouths don't even move properly. Other spots though like when you first sit down with Dex, T-Bug and Jackie in The Afterlife and Jackie is tapping his leg anxiously and Dex is smoking a cigar just looked REALLY good. It really felt like you were sitting down with real people in that part. If they could hit that note more consistently it would be really amazing.				
					I've seen some really, really good moments in particular side quests and in some of the main missions. But no, it doesn't stand up to the level seen in TLOU2 or even Uncharted 4. But I still think it's worth praising for the times it does work really well. 				
					Sorry Josh, hope you get some rest soon!				
					Body language is good, yeah. I can see people clearly react to specific things I say, like look away at the mention of someone's name. It's well done!				
					A lot of the characters in this game want revenge on someone... seems to be a core theme... 				
					Good review, I agree with most all of it. Also, this seems like a good place to dump some random thoughts I had on the game.  None of this should be a spoiler but obviously nuke it if you think otherwise. I finished over the weekend with around 30ish hours of playtime I think.  Overall I liked the game quite a bit, but it could have been amazing with a bit more work.  I imagine that whenever we see a sequel it'll address a lot of complaints people had since they'll have this game to build off of rather than completely developing it from the ground up. Main story was good.  I didn't do a ton of sidequests but I did both the Panam and Judy quest chains and they were great.  The two different endings I saw were both good and not some ME3 or Deus Ex crap where they were just slightly different. They put a good amount of effort into the end sequences, and I'm not sure which choice I preferred more.   Some skills could have used a bit of work.  I went reflex/cool/int to basically try to be a cyber-ninja stealthing around and hacking people to blind them and then chopping them up with my katana.  But there really wasn't much to make melee survivable for some of the areas where you couldn't stealth.  Maybe the OS upgrade to slow time for longer would have helped, but I wanted to hack stuff still.  I also did not come close to getting any of my skills to 20.  I'm pretty sure the highest I had was maybe around 10. It would have been nice to see them do more with the various gangs.  The maps showed how each area was primary controlled by one specific gang, but none of that mattered too much.  They were just kind of minor details in the story. Quest chains that made use of skills would have been good. Like Skyrim guilds. Braindance stuff was good but they kind of stopped using it halfway through.  Not sure any quest chains had as many paths as the first big one with Maelstrom and getting the bot.  So many messages and calls to buy cars. Items outside of crafting were mediocre. I never got anything too amazing for my build. I don't think I ever seen a single cyberdeck drop.  Not sure how enemy scaling worked but for a long while I couldn’t mess with any random street gang members outside of missions because they would just one shot me.  
					Curious if you could give it a rating assuming most of the bugs were fixed? Would it rate 8, or 8.5 or even 9 out of 10? 
					Without the bugs, I'd probably be willing to give it an 8. We don't really do decimals here. I think it would need more features to really hit that 9 mark, tbh. There are some core RPG things missing that I'd love to see added. All in all, I really, really love the game and plan to replay it again over our break with a different lifepath/sex and focus on skills, so i guess that should tell you how much I enjoy it as a whole. But yeah. 				
					All in all a fair review.  I LOVE the game, and I've put a shitton of time into it so far.  I beat it once already with around 45 hours in.  Already started on a second run. There are a ton of issues that really need to be ironed out.  I'm sure that things will be patched into a much more playable experience than some people are currently getting. Even with all the crazy shit I ran into I can look past it.  There is just a shitton of fun to be had in this crazy little game. 				
					Yeah. I agree. I really love it and want it to be as good as it can be. I just ran into too many issues to call it a great game. It has the potential to be great, but they've got to put some more work into it to really get it there.				
					Yeah.  I think I will wait.  I finally played Witcher 3 this year.  I don’t want to deal with an unfinished product.				
					The whole front of the game needs a redo like they did for witcher 2.  Why is there long VR training session on how to shoot a gun (press x) and grabbing enemies (press x) but absolutely nothing about crafting or how to craft or how cyberdeck works.  Also thr hacking needs a better explanation and all the breach protocol shit could also use better explanation.Also how to break down guns and why and what to do with the parts and why...just large sections of the game are like ""here whatever dunno doesn't matter""				
					Is this the same Joshua Hawkins? https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/16/us/communist-cookie-monster-mural.html 
					I am thoroughly enjoying the game. Yes, there are glitches. T-Pose, NPCs suddenly changing clothes and some items floating, but really it is not at all detrimental to the gameplay. It does disturb immersion, but not by much as for me it only happens very seldom. It's a fair review and I'm sure that in a few month common issues and glitches have been taken care of and perhaps some more detail given to NPCs and content.				"
Cyberpunk 2077,James Billcliffe,VG247,https://www.vg247.com/2020/12/07/cyberpunk-2077-review/,"Through the terrible power of 2020, Cyberpunk 2077 has gone from capping off the last generation to being one of the first huge games of the next - as if the expectations weren’t high enough already.  Between delays and a hype cycle that’s lasted the best part of a decade at this point, CD Projekt Red has the impossible task of making good on all the blanks filled in by 8 years of eager imaginations. The scale of Cyberpunk 2077 and Night City is vast, as is its level of detail. But at the same time, it’s definitely not what I expected. Personally, I didn’t appreciate just how much of a shooter it was going to be. Outside of the crackling chit-chat, it’s all-action, all the time. Throughout the main quest lines and side stories, you’re always busting into some dive bar, seedy basement, darkened alleyway or the like to steal a laptop, rescue a corpo’s prisoner, or take out a cybernetically-enhanced gangster who’s pushed their luck a little too far. 
 
And while you can opt for a quieter approach, the at times finicky stealth - where you can sidle right up behind a goon and not have the prompt to grab them appear properly - makes it much easier to barge in with a foghorn and pick up the pieces later. In fact, stealth is the weakest part of Cyberpunk’s action, and doesn’t feel that viable until you purchase a couple of specific and entirely optional upgrades which allow you to throw knives and slow down time when you’re about to be spotted.But while stealth takedowns and kills have just a couple of animations, shooting is mercifully much better - tight and twitchy right out of the gate, of a quality and speed which is rarely on offer in games with a role-playing focus. The way Cyberpunk’s systems are built means a lot of its variety comes from the constant loot carousel. You’ll be pawing through granular stats to switch to something with 0.3 more DPS after nearly every fight. So while you’re facing similar targets a lot, you’re doing it with a different toolkit each time. Once you find something that works for you, crafting skills can be used to upgrade a favourite gun or craft a familiar replacement. 
 
All the weapon types you'd expect from a first-person action game are here. There's shotguns, automatic pistols, revolvers, sniper rifles, SMGs and so on. There's also lethal bladed and non-lethal blunt melee weapons, plus some functionality-based subdivisions within guns like ricocheting Power, auto-locking Smart, and charge-up Tech firearms - each with multiple brands and skews of equipment within them. All of this is said while neglecting the universe-defining netrunning Quickhacks, and top-end Cyberware like forearm mounted Mantis Blades. Through expensive augmentations you can make yourself a weapon, able to jump higher or chop people to mincemeat with just your bare hands. So there’s genuinely a huge amount of choice, and practically every weapon at your disposal feels well-designed in terms of booming sound, futuristic look, and weighted heft. With the mountains of attributes to deliberate between, perks to sift through, and buffs to frown over, Cyberpunk 2077 is full of these complicated systems. Dark screens dense with tiny text and percentages - much like the Mutagens in The Witcher 3 - that can feel overwhelming until you just give in and spend your points willy nilly. 
 
In this sense, Cyberpunk might be a game that’s enhanced in replays, when a knowledge of the skills available will allow you to push towards a more specific build. Late-game skill resets are possible, but are costly.So although they’re not the best explained, there’s a lot of experimentation to be found in feeling your way forward. But while these systems have the kind of sprawling depth befitting of such a massive game, they don’t do a huge amount for role play, and that’s another front where I feel like the hype has diverged from reality. Go in expecting to change much more than your wang in the character creator and you’re going to be disappointed. There’s only two body types - one masculine, one feminine. You can change V’s face to your heart’s content, but they’ll always have the same body build. Within the story, in truth V is as much a set character as Geralt in the Witcher, and you’re more guiding their choices than fully designing your own person. 
 
There’s obviously a limit to the kind of control the player can have over a cohesive story, and a lot of the time it feels like - especially in the early game - you’re given the illusion of choice or power over smaller plot points, rather than a defining say. There are a lot of really frenetic and intense set- pieces that just wouldn’t work without the game funnelling you towards them, so I feel like the decision to focus on a more closely designed narrative is one that really works  - but again, it’s about managing expectations.  That’s not to say it’s totally static though. Some quests can be completed in a non-linear manner, and dialogue will acknowledge that and other changing circumstances. Quest givers will frequently reference how you completed a particular quest in their dialogue. So even though, most of V’s dialogue choices don’t amount to much other than role-playing flavour, the level of fine detail in touches like this is impressive in a game so large.Another easy comparison is with Fallout 4. You’ve got a created but fully-voiced character brushing shoulders with different factions, each struggling for power within a city state that is almost a character in itself. A lot of your role play is coming from the equipment and clothes that you collect, and you explore the wackier side of dystopia in lighter side missions. And there are a lot of side missions. Whether it’s action-focused Gigs for the many fixers throughout Night City or chattier stories with the varied roster of secondary characters, there’s an incredible amount to get lost in. It’s easy to see CDPR took the adoration of The Witcher 3’s side quests seriously, and there's loads of easter eggs to hunt down across the gleaming high-rises and dark alleys of Night City. The architecture of Night City itself is one of the best parts of Cyberpunk 2077. The sense of scale and verticality achieved by the first- person perspective makes it feel big, even if you can drive from one end of the game world to the other relatively quickly. The size of the world and how seamless it is can’t be overstated. The occasional elevator ride is used to hide loading, but they’re fast enough and spent in the company of in-elevator TVs playing Night City’s news and entertainment shows, so you don’t notice.  
 
While the game has you on rails for the first few missions, it very quickly relinquishes that control and lets you completely off the leash. The prologue of the game consists of a few hours’ worth of main story missions in only one district of the map before you see that ‘Cyberpunk 2077’ title card, but it’s easy enough to get lost enjoying side content and not see that title card until five or ten hours in. The crowd density, in particular, is often immense, but this does seem to come at the expense of AI, and the in-game reactiveness of the world looks to be tuned towards giving you a smoother ride as a result. For instance, shaking the cops after starting a firefight in the street or mounting the sidewalk as you check your phone is just a matter of burning a few blocks down the road. They never put up much resistance.Scale is the main buzzword, then, but look a bit closer and the details and ambience of the world has very obviously been pain-stakingly crafted. There’s an excruciating, shocking level of detail used to depict the grimy, hyper-sexualised, hyper-corporatised dystopia of Night City. In this Cyberpunk feels relatively unmatched, sitting alongside the efforts of Rockstar Games in the immersive properties of its world.The game’s over-the-top attitude to sexual freedom means it’s definitely not one to fire up on Christmas morning to show your grandma; there are more dildos than hot dinners, and the first-person sex scenes are very silly. But this also means that things like the controversial Chromanticore ad are plastered on nearly every street and surface, and in fact come off worse in the context of other in-game ads being played for laughs or easter eggs. Other issues that’ve been criticised pre-release, like a reliance on stereotypical representations of non-white characters, also run through the whole game and its giant city. In the midst of such intense anticipation and scrutiny, it’s easy to get carried away with what Cyberpunk 2077 could have been. The final experience might be more familiar than many predicted, with plenty of elements that aren’t perfect, but it's dripping with detail and engaging stories. With so much to see and do, Cyberpunk 2077 is the kind of RPG where you blink and hours go by, which is just what we need to finish off 2020.Reviewed on PC, copy provided by publisher.You're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!

Cyberpunk 2077,William Schwartz,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-review/,"There’s something wrong with Cyberpunk 2077.  It has the distinct feel of a game that had to be released, irrespective of the issues that it had.  For those that haven’t been following along, this game has been in development for quite some time.  It’s also been delayed numerous times.  And here we are, a game that has seemingly been being polished for months, has launched with a myriad of bugs and issues across every platform that it’s on, prompting purchasers to request refunds in mass.  It doesn’t help that this game may be the most hyped release in the last 5 years, perhaps longer.  The hype was strong even when it was just a screenshot and a logo.  It is Cyberpunk after all, the video game adaptation of Mike Pondsmith’s board game.  A setting that should be absolutely perfect for CDPR’s next role-playing game.It’s hard to imagine another delay for the game, but it probably needed itIt’s such an incredibly high bar that was set for this game.  Even if the game was good, Cyberpunk 2077 would have a hard time meeting or exceeding these expectations.   The reality is that it’s not very good.  Depending on what platform you’re playing it on, it’s objectively bad and borderline unplayable.  If you’re trying to play this on a PlayStation 4, congratulations you’re playing on a potato.  If you’re here reading this review and are debating buying it for yourself or someone for the upcoming holidays, do yourself a favor and hold off until patches for those legacy platforms hit.  The newer systems aren’t quite as bad on the performance end of things, the more powerful your machine the better it looks and plays.CD Projekt Red are exceptional story-tellers though, especially when it comes to telling someone else’s story, digitally. The Witcher 3 was carried almost entirely by conversation trees and side quests and was largely regarded as the game of the year in 2015.  Like that game, the gameplay and narrative of Cyberpunk 2077 stand at odds with one another.  Almost as if it’s the CDPR stamp of development, Cyberpunk 2077 tells an engrossing story, introduces you to plenty of interesting characters, and yet it fails to make the game engaging when it comes to gameplay itself, leaving it feeling run of the mill for an open world or role playing game.  It does very little that it owns whole cloth, offering something that feels like a patchwork of cobbled together systems from other popular game franchises.  (Sorry, those will be my only two quilt making references for the entire review)  Whether it’s combat, puzzle solving, exploration, or anything outside of the relationships and conversations between characters, Cyberpunk 2077 feels shallow and uninspired, albeit gorgeous.What it does well goes quite far in redeeming those other features.  Great conversations, interesting side quests, and a decent main path make the game enjoyable at times.  It’s one of the only games (like The Witcher 3) where it’s fun to exhaust every dialogue option that you can in each and every conversation.  The trick of enveloping you in this world is pulled off well when you’re just taking in the sights and sounds of Night City, talking to its citizens or watching the oddities stroll up and down the street. As it is in a CDPR game, the good stuff is off the beaten path.  That means that side quests will hold some of the best of this world building and flavor that you’re looking for.Cyberpunk 2077 is also an impressive next-gen showcase when it comes to visuals.  Even if that next-generation you’re talking about is actually the next-generation in graphics cards that you can put in a high-end PC.  It’s hard to recommend playing Cyberpunk on anything but the latest and greatest of PC hardware.  Our review started on the PlayStation 4, then moved to the PS5, at which point we moved to PC to see the absolute best it had to offer and give it the fairest shake we possibly could.  We touched on this above, but we are technically reviewing the PC version of the game.  However, if you’re looking to play this game while only having the PS4 or PS4 Pro, you should probably wait.  While the PS4 Pro version is a little better than the former, it’s not a good game on those legacy platforms.  That lack of optimization is found across all platforms though, even on the shiny PC version with all the bells and whistles turned-on, Cyberpunk 2077 is buggy and it’s hard to imagine a playthrough without encountering something game breaking, or at least something that contributes to your disbelief in the fantasy of this world.  Even though the game is an ambitious open world, the sheer lack of polish can be jarring at times easily putting it on the level of something like Fallout or Skyrim when it comes to bugs and visual oddities.  With game breaking and sometimes progress thwarting issues cropping up in the game, loveable jank this is not.  Cyberpunk 2077 has the feeling of a game that just couldn’t be delayed again, regardless of how many bugs lay in wait for unsuspecting beta testers fans.There are some true moments of beauty in this gameNothing terribly special to look at on the PlayStation consoles, the PC version running on the RTX 3090 is definitely a sight to behold.  I don’t think there’s been a better showcase for the ray-tracing capabilities of the Nvidia graphics cards than this game.  While you’re only going to squeak out 60 frames with all of these GPU intensive features turned on, the results are nothing short of amazing.  Cyberpunk 2077 is nothing if not atmospheric and there are some true moments of beauty in this game between the bizarre bugs that you’ll encounter.While bugs and other issues, like unoptimized versions of the game, can be fixed with patches down the line, what can’t be fixed is a lack of diversity in the missions of the game and the sheer fact that most of the worthwhile stuff is tucked away in side missions.  This itself isn’t a huge surprise considering the structure of The Witcher 3, but it also means that many folks won’t ever see it.  A rather pedestrian, though enjoyable, main path, skin deep customization/progression options, a cumbersome inventory system and uninspired core combat systems cement this game’s mediocrity.Night City never feels alive in the way that you expect from a game of this magnitudeEven hours after the game lays itself bare for you, which takes quite some time to get to, you have the feeling that something is being held back.  That secret sauce that should make an average game great, but it never comes.  Combat never feels all that great, regardless of which type of character you choose to create through the usage of your upgrade points.  Theoretically there are numerous ways to play the game, but situations that you encounter don’t really offer much reason to play to those strengths  It all feels somewhat pre-determined and linear.  While the world is beautiful, thought provoking, and just begging to be explored, it’s plainly obvious that this was meant to be a guided tour and not the sandbox experience that game’s like this can be.  That’s fine, even if they weren’t going for a sandbox style game, the blueprint for a dynamic open world game was laid down by Rockstar just a couple of years ago with Red Dead Redemption 2.  Cyberpunk 2077 just doesn’t have any of that magic that makes the world come alive and in comparison to contemporaries, it feels antiquated.It feels antiquated in its cumbersome menus.  It feels antiquated in the number of bugs and visual oddities that you’ll come across.  Outside of some great characters that have some fantastic writing and voice-over work behind them and some really impressive next-gen visuals on PC the game never sets its hook with a gameplay loop.  The gunplay and melee combat is simply middling at the very best.  Same goes with the driving.  It feels average in each thing it tries, trying to be too much for too many, and in the process becoming something for noone to enjoy.  Cyberpunk 2077 doesn’t have a single thing to hang its hat on in the gameplay department that hasn’t been better done in more focused games.  Cyberpunk 2077 is the opposite of what it should be, ironically.  It caters to as many people as possible with what feels like a very dumbed down and homogenous set of systems and gameplay ideas.Cyberpunk 2077 will ultimately be optimized for every platform and the major bugs will likely be squashed, but its real problems will remain.  A lack of gameplay and systems that matter leave the game feeling uninspired, even if some of the conversations and characters in this world are the best we’ve seen in quite some time.
- This article was updated on December 15th, 2020 Attack of the Fanboy / GAME REVIEWS / Cyberpunk 2077 Review"
Cyberpunk 2077,Mick Fraser,God is a Geek,https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-review/,"December 10, 2020I don’t want to give you mixed signals here, but I feel I need to warn you to temper your expectations while also reassuring you that Cyberpunk 2077 is one of the most consistently astounding pieces of media I’ve ever had the pleasure of consuming. It’s that good, even with a handful of flaws that loom too large to fully ignore. It’s hard not to be a little distracted by occasional visual glitches in such an otherwise well-realised world. But for every hiccup that threatens to send a distracting ripple through your immersion, there are two, three, four tiny details that pull you right back down below the surface.CD Projekt Red didn’t create the world of Cyberpunk 2077 – that was Mike Pondsmith, who created the board game Cyberpunk way back in 1988 – but their version of it feels like the end of a half dozen neon-lit roads that started at Blade Runner, Altered Carbon, Deus Ex, Ghost in the Shell, and led through the sand-blasted Badlands to Night City, a Frankenstein metropolis built from the bits and pieces of every cyberpunk dystopia of the last three decades. It could almost be called derivative – and fairly so – but Night City doesn’t feel like some sandbox built for you to run amok in. Night City feels like something older than you, something that was here before you and will be here after you’re gone.At the brass tacks, it’s an open world peopled by endlessly looping NPCs, rolling along with the day/night cycle like bearings in a hot tin cylinder. There’s a weather cycle, of course, a traffic system riddled with jams and honking horns, and a veritable parade of gaudy, in-your-face adverts pushing sugar, fast food, caffeine, alcohol, and sex (my god, the sex in this game). But there’s substantially more to it. I’m not going to dribble hyperbole everywhere and suggest there’s a living ecosystem at work or that it’s any busier than cities we’ve seen Ubisoft and Rockstar put out in the past. The big difference here is the level of detail. You’ll see NPCs repeating their behaviours, sure, but there are so many to repeat that the impact is lessened. Incidental conversations never seem to loop, at all, and random events take place that you won’t see coming. But it’s the character that makes this game special. There’s so much character here that it drips through the cracks, oozes through the asphalt. You taste it in the wind and rain. Dammit: the hyperbole got me in the end.Jokes aside, a lot of that character is visible because you see this world through V’s eyes, and V is an exceptionally fun protagonist, however you build them initially. The character creator is incredibly in-depth, eschewing sliders in favour of multiple choices of eyes, hair, mouth, jaw, tattoos, make up, genitalia. You’ll also customise your cyberware implant scars and starting stats. Body, Intelligence, Technical ability, Reflexes, and Cool dictate how the behind-the-scenes math goes – everything from your HP pool to your chance to evade. To be clear, despite appearances in trailers, this is not a first person shooter. It’s an RPG through and through, and the efficacy of headshots has as much to do with your damage stat as with the high-calibre rounds you’re squeezing off.To call Cyberpunk 2077 dense would be a grand understatement. There are systems upon systems at play, with your primary progression split into two paths: standard XP and Street Cred. The first is earned through direct action like combat, exploration, and using the perks associated with your core stats (which you unlock using points gained when you level up). The second, Street Cred, comes from completing jobs for Fixers and helping people out, and allows the use of stronger and better gear and Cyberware. Clothing affords an armour rating and a variety of buffs, as well as adding to your style. Sadly though, there’s no barber or tattooist in the city so you can’t change your appearance once it’s locked in. You also can’t apply cosmetic layers, so if your best gear happens to be a leather balaclava, pink biker jacket and metallic red miniskirt, that’s what you’ll be wearing. It’s not a major issue as you only really see V when you’re riding a bike or looking in a mirror (or on the inventory screen) but in a game world that puts so much emphasis on style and reputation, it feels like an omission.On the other side of your character’s progression is Cyberware. This comprises the implants and augmentations V can equip to enhance their abilities. If you played Deus Ex: Human Revolution, you’ll recognise some of that DNA here, as you apply biotech upgrades to your various organs to improve and enhance a multitude of abilities. You can apply scanners to your eyes that notify you when you’re spotted, or put retractable blades in your wrists, or equip health-regen augments, or any of several dozen other add-ons that turn you from a common street hood to a superhuman cyber warrior. Add to this the ability to scan your environment and hack electronics and even the implants in those around you, and there’s not only a lot to unlock but a lot to learn and get used to. And Cyberpunk isn’t great at explaining a lot of these systems. The Breach Protocol hacking mini game, for example, is fairly simple once you understand it, but the super-fast one-and-done tutorial left me needing to learn by doing.Although you won’t necessarily realise it, the first 6 or 7 hours of Cyberpunk 2077 is spent funneling you towards an explosive turn of events that effectively blends your chosen origin story with the grander narrative. Whether you choose to be a Street Kid, Nomad or Corpo, you’ll willingly enter a life of crime in a city where reputation is everything and one of the highest honours attainable is having a drink named after you in the Afterlife club when you buy the farm during a badass mission. You won’t realise you’re being swept up in a story you’re not in control of, and that you’re being dragged irrevocably towards your first meeting with Johnny Silverhand.Almost as much of a protagonist as V, Keanu Reeves’ aggressively cool ex-Terrorist is a relic of a bygone era, a legendary name in Night City, and the catalyst for much of what you do and is done to you. After a brush with death, the cyber imprint of Johnny Silverhand becomes tied to V, their fates entwined, and he’ll turn up regularly to comment on the world, offer advice, and generally piss off V. The relationship between the two of them is the backbone of the storytelling, but the writing is so consistently incredible that even seemingly minor characters feel fully fleshed-out, layered and interesting.What CDPR have done with the story here is nothing short of wizardry. Side jobs and minor gigs roll along with the main plot, weaving a dense web of character and intrigue, leading you down tangents for hours at a time that are so in-depth and detailed you won’t realise they’re not part of the primary narrative. The delivery is as impressive as the writing, too, with some of the finest voice work I’ve ever heard, combined with animations so nuanced I genuinely said “Wow” in response to some of the NPCs simply moving, fidgeting or emoting during a conversation. These characters feel like people, they feel vital, and most importantly they’re memorable. The “Nomad mission line” for example is fantastic, and while you’re on the outside of the central conflict, you’re still a driving force in how events unfold and how the involved characters interact with each other. The level of player agency rarely let’s up: this is V’s story, yes, but it’s so much bigger than just one person.Aesthetically speaking, Cyberpunk 2077 is impressive – though I will say not as impressive as the marketing has led us to believe it would be. Bugs and glitches aside for a moment, I had to make a lot of adjustments to my graphics settings to make the game look right. That said, with ray tracing on and everything dialed to high, I still had no major framerate issues at all. And considering how much is going on at any given moment, that’s impressive work. Occasional texture pop-in isn’t enough to break immersion, though some of the bugs might be. From floating NPCs to physics freak-outs, sound bugs, and weird movement issues (one of them kept forcing V to crouch and stare at her feet until I reloaded) even after a pre-release patch I was seeing scattered bugs throughout my entire playthrough.I hate to sound like an apologiser, but it really is to be expected in a world this dense and busy. Even simply walking the streets will reveal random crimes to stop, side gigs to take part in, maybe a sudden shootout between cops and gangers. Maybe you’ll spot special graffiti that awards you with “Tarot cards” or come upon a building or back alley worth exploring. One thing I really hope they patch a little is the constant ringing of V’s phone. More and more Fixers and clients appear by the minute (I literally timed the number of calls during a particularly busy 20-minute period to find that I was getting a phone call with a new job offer roughly every four minutes), and it soon becomes impossible to remember all of them. The mission log is similar to the one in The Witcher 3, and just as user unfriendly here.Thankfully, the variety of mission types is high. While the random crimes like drug deals or assaults follow very similar patterns, the side missions and gigs are all unique and many unfold in unexpected ways. Combat plays a large part, but is often not the focus, and in most cases stealth is an option (you can finish the game without willfully killing anyone). The shooting is satisfying thanks to the array of weapons and their various attributes (power weapons can be charged for example, while the ammunition fired from smart weapons can be tracked and controlled mid-air), but the stealth element is pretty cool too, using quickhacks to distract the enemy, hiding the incapacitated, and watching the cone of vision on cameras and patrolling guards. If anything truly let’s Cyberpunk 2077 down though, it’s the melee combat. It just doesn’t feel polished enough, with enemies that hit you from well out of reach, inconsistent collision detection and low damage feedback. It’s only a minor part of the experience outside the optional street fights though, and in the heat of combat, whipping out a katana or, in some cases, a giant studded sex toy, feels pretty exciting.Yes, there are occasional sex toy weapons. In fact, it’s pretty hard to avoid sex in Night City. It’s everywhere, especially at night when the neon lights are up, every billboard is awake, and holograms hock flesh like it’s just another narcotic. If I’m really, really honest, it’s a bit much at times. It’s so in-your-face, and some of it feels genuinely a bit sleazy, but it never feels utterly out of place. In this future flesh is just something else to sell, and if the goal was to immerse us in a world where nothing feels sacred, holy or clean anymore, then mission accomplished, I guess.  But that’s not what Cyberpunk 2077 is when you drill to its core. It’s not our future, really, as the 2023 it shows in occasional flashbacks is already a dystopia, where people like Johnny Silverhand are already enhanced with robotics. Cyberpunk 2077 is a pure fantasy, brought to life by CDPR’s designers. From every blinking vehicle that glides over head, every shiny puddle, every garish over-sexualised holo-billboard, to the dry grass and rusty skeletons of the Badlands, or the hot chrome of the inner city at night, this is a beautiful but deeply corrupted world.Whether you’re a Nomad, a Street Kid or a Corpo suit starting out, whether you’re going to become a cyberninja, a netrunner or a legendary street racer, there’s a destiny for you in Night City. The story path you follow may ultimately lead to the same place as your friends who are also playing, but the routes you take to get there will almost certainly diverge in a myriad of ways, large and small. And there are dozens of things I haven’t even mentioned yet: friendships you’ll develop along the way that will matter more than they should, Keanu’s scene-stealing turn as Silverhand, the atmosphere when you return to V’s apartment block and sit on a balcony watching virtual people go about their virtual business, or stumble across an Easter egg like the three seashells.Cyberpunk 2077 is one of the best games I’ve ever played. It’s also one of the biggest, one of the most well-realised, one of the most well-written, but it’s not without fault. It’s let down by elements that should have been better; not the bugs, in particular (because they will be fixed), but things like the melee combat, the explanation of systems, the oppressive influx of side quests. I can’t stop thinking about this game, about what comes next in the half dozen side-gigs I’m still planning to go back and do, or about how I might tweak V’s abilities for the next few levels.This is a truly exceptional video game. It wears its influences and heart on its sleeve, isn’t afraid to go to places many games would avoid, and delivers immersion and storytelling on a scale rarely seen, despite the best efforts of its own bugs and glitches to prevent that. After eight years in the making, we’re finally invited to Night City, but once you’re there, don’t be surprised if you never want to leave.Incredible world-building

Cyberpunk 2077,Josh Wise,VideoGamer,http://www.videogamer.com//reviews/cyberpunk-2077-review," Posted in Reviews
Ripperdocs, rockerboys, braindances, screamsheets. Highriders, hotdoggers, and hydro. Eddies and gonks, choombas and rollers. Edgerunners, jainas, and joytoys. Such is the slang that seethes through Cyberpunk 2077, the new game from CD Projekt Red. The setting is Night City—a bright babel of steel and smog, located on the verge of the Pacific, under the rays of a scalding sun. We are a long way from the fertile hills and forests of The Witcher, the series that made CD Projekt Red into what the citizens of Night City might call a megacorp. And yet, even here, amid the metalheads and the netpigs and the ICE, the spell remains the same.No other developer is as adept at adapting the work of writers—at wrangling the fully formed visions of the page and coding them into colour and form. If this counts as a lack of imagination (the studio has yet to conjure a fiction from scratch), it’s more than made up for by the airtight seal of its worlds. The source here is Cyberpunk (and its subsequent editions, Cyberpunk 2020 and Cyberpunk Red), the tabletop role-playing game written by Mike Pondsmith, whose lore is rich in lingo. Dropping into Night City for the first time, I was reminded of A Clockwork Orange, Anthony Burgess’s dystopia, which was spiked with a Russian-flavoured dialect, called Nadsat, that locked us into its landscape of despair. As was the case with The Witcher 3—with its tempest of names and its slow-trickling accounts of regional trouble—the early hours of Cyberpunk 2077 feel like a wild hunt for footing. You’re plunged into the stab and chop of its streetspeak, and plied with tomes of cyberhistory.This could make for a muffled proposition: an enticing fantasy behind a firewall of chewy mythology. And I’m pleased to say it isn’t so. As one character muses, “Perhaps only a true outsider can appreciate the beauty of its fractal architecture.” In other words, “Don’t worry about the reading, get gawking.” Playing as a Corpo—one of three available life paths, the others being Nomad and Streetkid—the gawking began for me at the headquarters of the Arasaka Corporation: a bruising, rain-grey citadel housing a comb of cramped offices. The hero—if such a term can survive in a place like this—is V. My V started his adventure in a bathroom, wearing a black suit, puking into a sink, and staring into the mirror, queasy with doubt. Something big was about to go down, and this was the qualm before the storm.Sure enough, after a champagne-stocked ride in a flying car—a moment like the opening of BioShock, with its descending bathysphere and its fathomless city, infused here with the dry fizz of cynicism—V falls from grace to the livelier grind below. A six-month montage of crimes and misdemeanors establishes us in his new felon-for-hire routine, and we’re set loose in the streets. It’s a fascinating metropolis, one of gaming’s great cities. On foot, you’re locked into a first-person camera, adding a few volts of vertigo as you crane your head upwards to catch a sliver of sky between the buildings. When you’re driving (the playable vehicles are all earthbound, unfortunately), you can pull back into third person, and I recommend doing so; it’s the best way to soak up the mood, which is adrift in the throb of neon and the thrash of contaminated downpour.Indeed, the mood, and the depth of your submersion into it, is the most important part of Cyberpunk 2077. As you look back after finishing it, you realise the flimsiness of its plot—a coiled and corporate affair, aflame with notions of revolution and a vague thirst, in V, for infamy. Far more engaging are the folks at ground-level—both your friends, who regularly buzz your phone, and the fixers, who offer you jobs. These entail theft, cyber-attacks, protection, street races, assassinations, and much more besides. The map is heavily scattered with points of interest, but the game’s most interesting point, as well as its most potent draw, is the choice of style and strategy at your disposal.As with Deus Ex: Mankind Divided—a game to which CD Projekt Red owes much—stealth, shooting, and hacking are all viable options, along with body augmentation, which grafts on new gifts entirely. Take the Mantis Blades, for example: a pair of gleaming spring-loaded knives that fold neatly into the flesh of V’s forearm—useful for combat situations, but the sort of thing that you pray doesn’t accidentally go off in the bedroom. I was heartened to find that, for the stealth—an uncluttered brand of line-of-sight sneaking—CD Projekt had borrowed the Soliton Radar, from Metal Gear Solid, complete with enemy vision cones. The shooting, meanwhile, has a convincing crunch. Just like with Mankind Divided, you get the sense that none of the playstyles are composed of enough oomph that they could comfortably furnish a game of their own, but that they gel joyously together, and don’t feel spread thin.Where you may wish for added substance is in the breaching of enemy software. Depicting hacking in games is, traditionally, as dishonest as showing the act of writing is in movies—usually, a blizzard of pages and blurry keys, before a rosy manuscript is plonked down on a desk, ready for publication. This is how it should be, too; we wouldn’t wish to see, in our entertainments, the sweaty, coffee-driven truth. The hacking here is a simple number-sequence minigame, your success with which is influenced—as with all areas of play—on the points that you pool into various categories. This may count, given the subject matter, as an anticlimax. However, the surrounding texture is sublime: watch as V pulls an ethernet cable from his palm, with an impatient tug, and note the blood-red progress bars and blinking readouts that spill across his retinas. We’re in a future where technology isn’t just taken for granted; it’s installed, without a hitch or an itch, to our bodies, and the stream of life buffers on.None of which is new, for games, movies, or books, but what sets Cyberpunk 2077 apart is that such a future should appear, so dreamily, like the past. Following a botched heist, V slots an experimental chip behind his ear, and is then haunted by the digital ghost of Johnny Silverhand, who, in turn, is haunted by the physical body of Keanu Reeves, who provided motion capture and voice-over for the role. Most of us, I think it’s fair to say, wouldn’t have a problem with this situation. Reeves is one of the few actors whose consciousness is capable of squatting in your skull and not making the place seem crowded. The trouble is that Johnny’s personality is overwriting V’s (not a mammoth challenge, it must be said). “I’m like mold on fruit… creepin’ into you,” he says.The echo is of Johnny Mnemonic, the 1995 film—based on the short story of the same name, by William Gibson—in which Reeves, as the title character, plugged information into his head, like a human USB stick. That movie, set in 2021, has now gathered a thick coating of kitsch, and there is a streak of its naff ’90s charm in Cyberpunk 2077: in the appealing clunk of the way the future was imagined then. Stranger still, I detected a faint trace of Thomas Pynchon about the game. It’s there in the names—V, Johnny Silverhand, Alt Cunningham, Panam Palmer—which seem to teeter knowingly on the brink of a pun. And in the dashes of liquorice-dark humour; I got a particular kick from the AI-controlled taxi, who, mid-breakdown, laments, “Shrinks hate vehicles… we don’t have mothers.” In short, if you like your sci-fi weird, this is for you. As the narrative surges on (the main quest line runs to around the 20-hour mark), V becomes increasingly cracked. “It’s literally driving me crazy,” he says, to a kidnapped bioengineer. “None of that’s on the billboards I saw. Not even in the fine print.”Unfortunately, that sentiment has also been simmering outside the game. Since its release, last week, CD Projekt has issued an apology for only showing gameplay videos that were captured on next-gen hardware or high-end PCs. Those who bought it on last-gen consoles have found it in especially rough shape, with a faltering frame rate and a litany of bugs. I played it on a PlayStation 5, where it unreeled at a robust 60 frames-per-second, and I noticed very few visual glitches. I did experience three crashes, none of which—thanks to the autosave function—cost me any progress. This is a great shame, compounded by the lengthy development period (it was announced in 2013) and by the reportedly long hours and life-devouring overtime needed to get the game out on deadline. The troubled launch and the shoddy state of the last-gen versions will hurt nobody more intensely than the artists and developers, who may well have come to resemble the characters of their own creation—frazzled, fused to their computers, and wired into the limbo of non-stop work.
My guess is that time, and a series of hefty updates, will patch CD Projekt’s reputation and cool the conversation around Cyberpunk 2077. Whether or not it should cool is another matter. In the meantime, we have a game unlike any other. Though its urban playground is just as jostled by sin as those in Grand Theft Auto (what is Night City, after all, but a tech-infested version of Los Santos?), it lacks Rockstar’s soul-souring pessimism. There is a shard of something hopeful here. “We’re bankin’ on the human factor,” says Johnny, concocting a plan to save himself and V. And so it rings true. The scenes that have lodged most deeply in my memory are not those devoted to the chases, the shootouts, or the narrow squeaks, but those possessed of a quiet empathy. Sifting through the belongings of a departed friend, for instance; or the consolation offered by a sex worker, who downloads a share of V’s thoughts and dampens his fears. The moment is transactionary, love is not in the air, but you still leave with a lighter spirit. “Feelings be damned,” one character says. “This is pure biz.” But you don’t believe her. You’re banking on the human factor.Developer: CD Projekt RedPublisher: CD ProjektAvailable on: PlayStation 5 [reviewed on], PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Xbox Series S / X, PC, Google StadiaRelease Date: December 10, 2020To check what a review score means from us, click here.

Cyberpunk 2077,Jeff Grubb,GamesBeat,https://venturebeat.com/2020/12/07/cyberpunk-2077-review-a-look-at-the-present-not-the-future/,"Connect with top gaming leaders in Los Angeles at GamesBeat Summit 2023 this May 22-23. Register here.Cyberpunk 2077 is a promise. But it’s a different promise to different people. For many, it’s the blockbuster sci-fi followup to The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt that will do everything that game did but bigger. For me, Cyberpunk 2077 was the promise of the next generation of choice, simulation, and interactivity. Now that I’ve played it myself, I think that developer CD Projekt Red delivered a big-budget thrill ride with entertaining quests in a thriving setting.But it isn’t much more than that.Here are the basics: Cyberpunk 2077 is out December 10 for PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Stadia. It’s $60, and it will also run on PS5 and Xbox Series X, but it won’t get a next-gen patch for those system until next year. You create and control the character V, who lives in Night City and is looking to make a couple of big scores to enter the upper echelon of the criminal underworld.What Cyberpunk really is, however, is a big open-world action role-playing game. What it’s not is a look at gaming’s future. Instead, it feels like a summation of where we’ve come in gaming since the Xbox 360 generation. It feels like a game built by people looking around to see what works — like Grand Theft Auto’s open world, Watch Dogs’ hacking, Assassin’s Creed’s quest-filled maps, Fallout’s combat and character progression, Mass Effect’s dialogue system, Batman: Arkham Knight’s crime scene investigations, and every games’ skill trees.GamesBeat Summit 2023Join the GamesBeat community in Los Angeles this May 22-23. You’ll hear from the brightest minds within the gaming industry to share their updates on the latest developments.At the same time, Cyberpunk doesn’t try much new. It feels big and expensive — and getting all of these parts to fit together seems like an impossible challenge. But because of this, Cyberpunk 2077 is a glimpse at where we are and not what is next.Playing this game before most of the world puts me in an odd position. I’m torn due to a desire to answer two questions: Is Cyberpunk 2077 good, and does it live up to expectations? I think when it comes to characters and quests, the answer to both questions is yes.It shouldn’t surprise anyone that the studio that made The Witcher 3 made another game with great quests. It’s arguably what the studio is best at, and that holds true for Cyberpunk. Yes, the visuals and ray tracing are often stunning. And the worldbuilding is impressive. But Cyberpunk is at its best when you’re putting together the plans for a big job with a cool cast of characters.The game still has a small bag of verbs it puts to use within these quests. You’re primarily going to shoot and sneak. But CD Projekt Red keeps things fresh by breaking each quest up into stages that naturally build on each other while also revealing more about the world.One quest that I really enjoyed started with me trying to track down an engineer that I needed for important story reasons. That led me to one of the city’s many fixers, the people who set up underworld jobs (and apparently also all sell used cars). But she wouldn’t give me any details until I paid her, which gave me a chance to interact with the Side Jobs and Gigs. After putting together the scratch, however, she pointed me toward my target as well as the Nomad character Panam who, of course, needed help of her own.That involved us setting up a trap to distract a gang in an abandoned ghost town to steal back Panam’s car. She then took me to an underground tunnel for a fight and then to a motel in the California desert where she laid out a plan to help me find my engineer.And that’s how the game goes. You talk, the characters come up with some neat plans, and then you execute them. And that loop kept pulling me in because you almost always end up somewhere cool.The way you interact with the city and quests is pretty much what you expect: Stealth past enemies or shoot them. If you have hacking skills, you can use those. If you’re physically strong, you can take more damage and rush at people with a katana. But don’t expect that you’ll be able to go much deeper than that. This is not a game where you try to talk your way out of fights. You’re not going to follow a guard home, interrogate him, and then infiltrate a facility using that information.So despite how alive the city feels due to its mind-blowing ray-traced lighting, it’s still sterile. Things don’t just happen in Night City. At its heart, Cyberpunk 2077 is a map game. You choose a quest off the menu and then go and do whatever the developer designed for you.This philosophy filters down into the world itself and how interactive it really is. You’ll find pachinko machines and arcade games, but you can’t play them. You can scan people to reveal information about them, but I never found a use for that. If you want to have sex, two sex workers appear on your map. You’ll find empty seats throughout Night City, but you can only sit in certain designated chairs and only when the game permits it. If the game wants, you can sit back and drink a beer with a friend, but this is not something you can initiate on your own.All of this limits the potential for emergent storytelling. You aren’t going to stumble off the main quest line and into a series of unpredictable moments. Instead, CD Projekt Red is the one prescribing all of the action.And again, those quests are usually pretty fun. But the final product doesn’t feel like a real role-playing game that responds to your decisions.And on that point of feeling like an RPG, the character progression is also undercooked. I feel a vague desire to upgrade to improve my strength in combat or to open a door I otherwise couldn’t, but that’s about it. The game never puts me into situations where I imagine the new ways I’ll interact with the world as I get new capabilities. Sure, my character is a tank who is good with blades, and that’s different from how your character will work. But we’re probably both going to sneak through the stealth sections, shoot our way through the battle sequences, and do whatever the companion characters need us to do to keep the game moving forward.If CD Projekt Red’s core competency is writing quests, worldbuilding is a complementary pillar of the studio’s works. And Cyberpunk 2077 is more evidence of this.Night City is beautiful and ugly in all the ways a megacity should be. Every time you turn a corner, the game reveals another startling angle of the urban landscape. And it makes Night City feel menacing and inescapable. The visual fidelity and art both contribute to this sensation. The streets are packed with people and vehicles. Giant colorful holographic advertisements shoot into the sky. Neon lighting alerts you to restaurants and sex shops.And speaking of lighting, this is by far the best showcase for ray tracing so far. With an Nvidia RTX 3080 video card and using deep learning supersampling (DLSS), I was able to run the game at 1440p with RTX maxed out. This includes well-known RTX features like shadows and reflections, which look great. But it also includes RTX global illumination. CD Projekt Red uses a hybrid GI system that doesn’t use RTX for when light bounces off of objects and onto a second object, but all direct lighting is using ray tracing.The difference between Cyberpunk with RTX lighting and without is massive. With RTX, it looks lifelike with lighting that brings depth to characters as their clothing creates shadows on their bodies and lighting splashes correctly over curved muscles. Without RTX, the game looks significantly flatter and more like a video game. And thanks to DLSS 2.0’s performance setting, I was able to get these incredible benefits at a steady 60 frames per second.But the game is also undeniably buggy. I have a high tolerance for occasional funny glitches. I have high expectations, but getting a simulation of a world to behave is too high even for me. But in my time with Cyberpunk, I saw objects float, vehicles disappear, and characters drive while standing up. Also, sorting items doesn’t work properly, and I couldn’t get the context-sensitive stealth takedown to activate after dropping behind a certain enemy.The problem when a game has so many bugs is that it begins to compromise your belief in the world. If I expect something to happen and it doesn’t, was it because I was wrong about how the world would react or did a bug prevent it from happening? That’s where Cyberpunk 2077 is at as it launches.I think that Cyberpunk 2077 delivers the big-budget gaming thrills that many people are looking for. But it falls short in a few key areas for me, and a lot of that comes as a byproduct of its ambition.The problem is that the world of Cyberpunk 2077 suggests so much possibility. The megabuildings that make up the city’s skyline suggests vast interior spaces that don’t really exist. Merchants with a finite number of eurodollars suggests a simulated economy that isn’t in the game. The bustling streets suggests the potential for emergent story moments that almost never really happen.And, of course, no game has all of those things on top of everything Cyberpunk does offer. But the point is that Cyberpunk 2077 is so ambitious that you expect more from it. And when something is missing, it hurts the entire experience more.It’s like the food vendor that hangs out not far from V’s apartment. His stall looks attractive in that cyberpunk/Blade Runner style that makes everything in the game pop. It has steam rising off the food and nice lighting. If I were walking through L.A. and got hungry, I would want to stop and eat there. It helps contribute to the feel of the world — but that’s all it does. You cannot interact with the stall, eat its food, or even talk to the owner.It’s just set dressing.A lot of the game is just there to look good. And that’s fine — but it means I don’t want to spend a lot of time wandering around the world. If the environment primarily exists to look dope in the background while I’m doing the quests, then I’ll probably mostly stick to the main story, see what happens, and then bounce. It’s fine to make a game like that — for many, that’s the promise of Cyberpunk 2077. It just wasn’t the promise to me.Cyberpunk 2077 launches December 10 for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

Find out more about how we test, analyze, and rate.A Cyberpunk 2077 expansion is on the way, although we don't know exactly when it will come out.I volunteered to write our Cyberpunk 2077 review because I'd never played any of developer CD Projekt's games before — and I was curious what all the hype was about. Yes, I skipped The Witcher 3 (I've rarely ever enjoyed swords and magic games outside of the Zelda franchise), but Cyberpunk 2077's neon-soaked futuristic glory and the promise of Keanu Reeves lured me in.After one week of playing Cyberpunk 2077 (on the eve of its troubled release), I wished I could get that week back. I was nearly done with its mainline story, and that's given me enough moments to believe I'm judging it fairly. In that week, I'd gotten my fair share of hilariously buggy moments, inexplicable crashes and even been surprised by how short the mainline story is. I've learned enough about the game to write a fairly helpful set of Cyberpunk 2077 tips and tricks.Oh, and to get this out of the way early: I played Cyberpunk 2077 on an Xbox One X, which I selected because it's the only 4K console I have (it's still so hard to get a PS5 or Xbox Series X), and because I don't own a gaming PC. I hear the game runs better on tricked out PCs and the new consoles, but I'm of the opinion that you should only release games on consoles they'll run well on. While Cyberpunk 2077 came out on December 10 for the PC, PS4, Xbox One and Stadia (PS5 and Xbox Series X and S can run the game too), Sony removed Cyberpunk from the PlayStation Store on Thursday, Dec. 17. Why? Well, it runs really poorly on the PS4. One redditor (opens in new tab) even claimed it bricked their PS4. Cyberpunk 2077 finally came back to the PlayStation Store, in June 21 last year. However, Sony recommends you play Cyberpunk 2077 on a PS4 Pro and PS5 to avoid any performance issues. The game now also has official PS5 and Xbox Series X versions.To rewind a bit, Cyberpunk 2077 was arguably destined for a rocky start for some time prior to its release. CD Projekt originally slated the game for April 16, 2020. Then, it pushed back to Sept. 17, and then Nov. 19. Along the way, execs from CD Projekt promised (opens in new tab) that devs wouldn't suffer the long hours of work that have been commonly referred to as ""crunch."" Privately, the execs reportedly said crunch was necessary (opens in new tab). The company even admitted (opens in new tab) it didn't spend enough time on the PS4 and Xbox One versions.pic.twitter.com/jtF5WKCiroDecember 14, 2020But it turned out that 8 months of extra development time wasn't enough. The game hit the ground buggy, with a new wrinkle in its chaos: the visuals used for the braindance sequences caused seizures (opens in new tab), and Game Informer reported that the game uses blinking lights ""much like the actual device neurologists use in real life to trigger a seizure when they need to trigger one for diagnosis purposes."" An update added a warning.Then, it got worse. The company then apologized for the game's poor performance — #Cyberpunk2077Bugs is a fun hashtag to spend some time on — and told gamers that refunds would be possible, except Sony rejected refund requests. Then, Sony took the game off the virtual shelves, as explained earlier.OK, all that out of the way, let's talk about the game itself. When it's moving smoothly, you're in the modified body of V, a ne'er do-well who's moved back to Night City, who's returned home to seek glory. Not in it for the eddies (Eurodollars are the game's currency), V wants to be remembered. He makes friends with another criminal, the big hulking teddy-bear of a man Jackie Wells (Jason Hightower), and the pair become a force to be reckoned with.It's in these moments when you're seeing Jackie's vulnerability — his knee shakes slightly as you're getting info on the big mission that's going to make you infamous — that Cyberpunk actually engaged with me emotionally. And in these moments, when you're becoming friends with Jackie, and seeing the big man's bit of vulnerability — his knee shakes slightly as you're getting information on the big mission that's going to make you infamous — that Cyberpunk actually engaged with me emotionally. Your big task is to pilfer a bit of tech from the Arasaka corporation, and you get to play a bit of futuristic detective while doing so, scanning through 'braindances"" memories recorded to chips. Of course, that big mission goes very, very wrong. I'll try and keep this spoiler-free, but eventually you find your brain over-run by another identity. Johnny Silverhand (Keanu Reeves) is a musician/terrorist who's gone through his own chaos with the Arasaka corporation. And then the big mission of the game is revealed: you need to get this digital version of Silverhand out of your head before it kills you.Outside of the moments with Jackie, little in the game's mainline story actually resonated with me. This may be because the game (on an Xbox One) was far from immersive, but it's only through other characters, such as BD maestro Judy (Carla Tassara) and the rebellious Panam (Emily Woo Zeller) that Cyberpunk 2077 connected. Therefore, I spent large hours of the game waiting for one of these characters to resurface. The voice work from Hightower and Tassara is exceptional, and carried a lot of the weight for making those characters more dimensional, though I have to give them credit for the quality of the nervous looks from Jackie when you're trapped in an Arasaka penthouse tower room.V, on their own, is such an empty vessel that saving them didn't really do much for me. You can choose your backstory and your pronouns (though the game fails at providing a non-binary option), but I couldn't find a way to care about V.If I had to describe what it's like to play Cyberpunk 2077, I'd say ""Grand Theft Auto, but in the future."" You walk or drive around the wildly busy Night City, and then get missions (way too many missions, it could be argued). You're basically told to either kill, steal or talk to someone else, so on and so forth. There's also a world of tech to be hacked, so you can disable or toy with security cameras, vending machines, TVs and more. This tinkering is fun and opens up some creative options. If I had to describe what it's like to play Cyberpunk 2077, I'd say ""Grand Theft Auto, but in the future.""Navigating the 'braindance' video clips is the big novel bit of fun in Cyberpunk 2077. Once you jack in, you get to rewind, fast forward and jump around three layers, one for visuals, another for thermal signatures and another for audio. There, you find clues, and it's pretty neat.I selected Normal difficulty for the game because I always want to see what the creators think the baseline difficulty should be. It turns out that Normal in Cyberpunk is kinda easy. The enemy AI is remarkably unintelligent, letting me get away with sloppy play left and right, and I most noticed this when trying to be stealthy. Enemies take a while to actually notice you — a meter appears with an eyeball to show how long they're taking — and you can run away or around them (while still being near) to lower the meter. Metal Gear Solid this is not. Boss fights can be frustratingly never-ending or surprisingly short, so Cyberpunk 2077 fails to strike the right balance in that regard. For example, I took down a mech-riding Arasaka employee with a grenade and a shot of a gun, while the sledgehammer-wielding Sasquatch (who runs the Animals gang) took about 25 headshots with a pretty decent shotgun. And she wasn't even wearing any head armor.There's tons to be done to customize your character for greater fighting and techy efficiency, with upgrades to your arms, legs, immune system and more. But I just skipped over all of it because I never felt a need to. If the AI were smarter, or the game's mainline missions more demanding, there might have been a point to it all.Character customization feels hollow at best. If you choose male genitals, you can decide whether you're circumcised or not, and that's good for a chuckle or a glitch depending on your experience, but the aforementioned lack of a non-binary option rubs me the wrong way — and reminds me of the arguments that the game's release (and some of its in-game ads) were riddled with transphobia (opens in new tab). Oh, and if you pick any hair option you might not see it when you inevitably look yourself in the mirror: there's a glitch where wearing headwear including a balaclava can make you bald.If you're on a high-end PC with a mighty GPU, or a next-gen console, you might experience Night City and its missions as it was meant to be seen. But for as beautiful as the town looks in stills (or from inside cars as you're chauffeured around town), the game I played failed to run smoothly early and often, and this ruinined any chance I had at immersion. At the end of the day, the Cyberpunk 2077 I played felt more like fodder for YouTuber videogamedunkey (opens in new tab) (who pokes fun at glitch-filled games) than the presumptive Game of the Year nominee it was marketed as.When I ran into that diner to meet Takemura, the game simply froze and crashed. Another crash happened after I was saving a video clip of gameplay. I could go on, but I don't want to waste your time — that's Cyberpunk 2077's job.That starts with the little things, like the game freezing as I walked around a bar in a very early scene. And just simply observing your surroundings will lead you to see low-res assets used in the game, such as a machine that your new eyeball is put into by ripperdoc Viktor Vector, or the pizza on the table at the diner where you meet up with Goro Takemura.Cyberpunk 2077's big, wide, beautiful world truly falls apart if you peruse it with too much excitement. Specifically, if you run or drive fast around town, you'll see the game's framerate slowly dip, and it's best described as visually unappealing. And it gets worse. When I ran into that diner to meet Takemura, the game simply froze and crashed. Another crash happened after I was saving a video clip of gameplay, and then returned to play the game — which had to boot up. Apparently it just zonked out in the background. I could go on, but I don't want to waste your time — that's Cyberpunk 2077's job.NOW is the time to actually buy cyberpunk, while the bugs are still hot and hilarious, not refund it! cherish this pic.twitter.com/CSEmyKmrQlDecember 17, 2020If you can enjoy glitches and bugs as an absurdist art, then maybe you should be playing Cyberpunk 2077. I got a lot of laughs out of the game's biggest fails, like when I popped out of a car to shoot down drones, only to have the shotgun I was firing not actually show on screen. Or when I drove with Panam to a meet up, but instead of sitting beside her, I sat inside her, seeing her eyes from the inside, as well as her hair. The most comical of all moments involved trying to break into a shack through its window, only for that window frame to propel V back hundreds of feet, like it's an ejector seat. And these aren't isolated incidents, I've seen footage of others running into them online. Having finished my Cyberpunk 2077 review, I am ready to scream ""I'm free!"" Though the masochist in me is considering spending more time to finish the mainline story (There are multiple endings, which is why I might just read synopses online), I'm happy to be done with this game. If you were thinking about getting it (if you can even buy it), my best advice is to hold off for a while. At the end of the day, I feel bad for the engineers and developers who worked to get Cyberpunk 2077 in this working condition. The game is set to get major bug-fixing updates in January and February 2021, and I don't want to imagine how little personal time will be left for those workers this holiday season. Anyone with any power at CD Projekt should have tested this game on a PS4 and Xbox One to see how the vast majority of gamers would likely play it (PS5 and Xbox Series X scarcity was as predictable as anything in 2020). Pushing it to 2021 might have been bad for the company, but not pushing the game has hurt CD Projekt's reputation to an astronomical degree.In glimmering moments, even I saw the Cyberpunk 2077 that CD Projekt wanted me to see. But in one of the game's most emotional scenes, one of its more absurd glitches ripped me right out of the moment, and it's issues like that which leave me unable to tell anyone to spend $60 on this, unless it's for the lulz.Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, the game's first major expansion, will debut in 2023 and here's why it is the best time to play Cyberpunk 2077.Henry is a managing editor at Tom’s Guide covering streaming media, laptops and all things Apple, reviewing devices and services for the past seven years.

In the words of Fantastic Mr. Fox, you could say it’s a bit of a clustercuss.After eight years in the making, seemingly endless delays, and allegations of staff being mercilessly overworked in the final months, CDProjekt Red’s hugely anticipated and much ballyhooed open-world sci-fi action extravaganza starring Keanu Reeves is bound to evoke an emotional response, just perhaps not the one most people were expecting.Sign up to receive the daily top stories from the Financial Post, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.A welcome email is on its way. If you don't see it, please check your junk folder.The next issue of Financial Post Top Stories will soon be in your inbox. We encountered an issue signing you up. Please try again To be fair, the passion its creators have for cyberpunk fiction is plainly evident.Though technically based on a tabletop role-playing game, Cyberpunk 2077 draws inspiration from a huge array of works, ranging from films like Blade Runner and Strange Days to the writings of giants of the genre like William Gibson and Neal Stephenson. It examines the effects of technology run rampant on our culture and biology, asks inevitable Ship of Theseus-style questions about identity, invests the whole experience with a rebellious don’t-trust-the-suits vibe, and then wraps it all up in neon lights, punk rock styles, and angular brutalist architecture.Put simply, it feels the way cyberpunk should.It also spends heavily on story and character development. The hero, a mercenary named V whose appearance can be customized all the way down to specific genitalia details (I do not kid), has to deal with some mind-bending personal problems — not least of which is a weird sort of cyber-schizophrenia the cure to which may involve death — and we’re provided a good look into her psychology in the process. Her journey through the dark, dystopian streets of Night City, from up and coming merc to potential force for change, is well worth observing.Even more interesting are many of the characters she meets, ranging from a barmaid-cum-death racer and a prostitute whose “doll” implants make her an irresistible plaything for clients, to a disillusioned corporate bodyguard and a “ripperdoc” with big muscles and a heart of gold. With the help of some sharp writing and meticulous motion capturing, these characters feel real. We want to get to know them, and we appreciate their friendship.With such a strong and diverse supporting cast, the eventual arrival of Johnny Silverhand — a mystery character played by Keanu Reeves — borders on anticlimactic, especially given the actor’s predictably timber-like performance, which worked to his advantage playing a gobsmacked geek in The Matrix, but not so much as the angst-y cyberterrorist he’s supposed to be here. Still, just getting to see the man who played Johnny Mnemonic in a cyberpunk game is pretty fun.So far so good. But where things begin to break down is when we leave the game’s engaging scenes of exposition and dynamic character growth and actually start playing the game.The mission concepts are themselves fine. Great, actually. Much as in its previous open-world game, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, CDProjekt Red has done something few other sandbox game makers take the time to do: Avoid the sense of repetitive, cookie cutter action by developing narrative, motivation, and background for just about everything V does rather than just sending her out on endless fetch and bounty quests. There’s purpose to her actions, as well as a sense of a choreographed order to events, and it helps the player feel invested in their outcome.However, as most people with an internet connection have likely heard by now, the console editions of Cyberpunk 2077 are an unmitigated disaster from a technical perspective.We played the Xbox One version on an Xbox Series X (which helps a bit with performance) and it was glitchier than a Vanellope von Schweetz race. We fell through walls and floors, watched non-player characters randomly teleport around the screen in weird poses, saw loads of unintended nudity, were repeatedly unable to interact with certain objects and characters, and watched in disconcertion as characters looked meaningfully at and gestured towards V without speaking or moving their lips (thank goodness for subtitles). When a game is this buggy, players inevitably run into some supremely frustrating moments in which it’s impossible to tell if the trouble is simply because they can’t figure out what needs to be done next or due to some part of the game being broken and preventing progress.Plus, it performs terribly. Textures consistently fail to load, leaving objects such as items in shop display cases an indecipherable blur. Characters and cars regularly pop in and out of existence. And action sequences are often accompanied by noticeable lag.It’s a huge disappointment, especially considering how this was a game that was supposed to be a graphical showcase. Apparently the PC edition runs much more smoothly (hopefully the next-generation console editions, due out next year, will perform better as well), but that’s of little consolation for anyone who pre-ordered the game or picked it up on day one.But the really ugly truth is that not all of the game’s woes are to be blamed on insufficient playtesting and quality control. There are some serious design problems as well.Font sizes, menu design, and even the placement of pop-up information in the heads-up display all feels a bit willy-nilly and unintuitive. Even after dozens of hours of play we were still sometimes pressing the wrong buttons and looking in the wrong places for information. This proves especially problematic when trying to be stealthy or make use of the game’s sophisticated hacking and breaching mechanics, which are meant to provide strategic options and give V a leg up when planning missions. It’s often easier and quicker to just run in with guns blazing than try to be sly or sneaky. That makes the game less fun, but gamers are notoriously like water in that they generally end up following the path of least resistance.There’s also endless pieces of useless loot. Ashtrays, playing cards, stress balls, and sex toys (oh, so many studded dildos) litter the world, and the natural gamer urge to go examine every collectible item will ruin the pace of storytelling and missions unless you can overcome it.Also an enemy of pacing: Simple little alphanumeric hacking puzzles that bizarrely pause action sequences mid-play. Because bad guys are happy to wait for you to hack into their software to make them easier to kill.And what exactly is the point of providing scores of different consumable items — each with their own artwork and descriptions, many of which do pretty much the exact same thing — other than force us to occasionally spend minutes wading through all of them to see if any will do something new or useful?Perhaps if management had cut some of these “features” and directed the development team to focus on more important things — like finding and fixing bugs — the game would have been in a more presentable state at launch.The sad truth is that Cyberpunk 2077 is awash with problems. Which makes it all the more miraculous that we were compelled to plod through its litany of tribulations simply to keep experiencing the story, characters, and world that CDProjekt Red has created. Clear away the grit and there remains something special here that’s bound to light up the imaginations of cyberpunk fans.A better option for console players, however, would be to wait for the next-generation versions, which will likely (or should that be hopefully?) look and perform better, and could benefit from whatever retrofits and patches CDProjekt Red sees fit to release based on player feedback in the coming months.

Cyberpunk 2077,Graham Smith,"Rock, Paper, Shotgun",https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/12/16/cyberpunk-2077-review/,"A big, beautiful and broken messDeveloper: CD Projekt Red
Publisher: CD Projekt Red
Release: Out now
On: Windows
From: Steam, GOG, Humble, Epic
Price: £50/$60/€60I was in an NPC's car as she drove us across Night City when a thought occurred to me. We were driving at night to perform a risky stealth mission, which required me to break into a compound filled with military security so we could, to put it briefly, hack the planet. On the drive, two cars spawned out of thin air in front of us, blocking the road, but my driver didn't react. We plowed into one of the cars as if it wasn't there, sending it twirling into the air like it was stuffed with helium. Our own car wasn't even slowed down.The thought: Cyberpunk 2077 has as much in common with early '00s Eurojank as it does with the Rockstar games it aspires to. I'm OK with this. If it's a choice between a less polished Grand Theft Auto or a high budget Boiling Point, I'd choose the latter every time.Eurojank games like Boiling Point, The Precursors, or even arguably the Stalker series, aimed for vast open worlds and absurd systemic complexity. It was an ambition far beyond their means and I'd not recommend most of these games to anyone, but the messy results were always exciting. While we now live in an era when open world games are commonplace, they're mostly too sensibly scoped and carefully produced to swing for the fences.I appreciate Cyberpunk 2077, then, which has the best looking hair I've ever seen in a game, but which is populated by NPCs who can't pathfind around a parked car. A game with multiple choices which dramatically alter the story, but just as many story-stopping bugs. A first-person game that can theoretically claim to offer as many angles of approaches as an immersive sim like Dishonored or Deus Ex, but with RPG progression systems that make many of those available approaches dull or broken or both.You play as V, a mercenary for hire within Night City. Based on your character creator choices, you can be either male or female - though your in-game pronouns are determined by which voice you choose, and your choice of voice is separate from any choices you make about your body, including your genitals. If you were hoping for better trans representation from the year 2077, you are going to be disappointed - this is no more advanced than 2011's Saints Row 3.You also choose from one of three life paths - I went for Street Kid, a person raised by the dealers and vagrants of Night City. This gave me unique dialogue options throughout the game, in which I could flex my knowledge of the city, and as a backstory it fits with my perception of the character. Night City, the game tells us again and again, is a deafening, overpopulated, suffocating place, and V's life of crime is pitched as an attempt to rise above the din and make a name for themselves. The other two options are Nomad, which starts you in the badlands outside of the city, and Corpo, which has you already living a life of corporate espionage in the offices of the city's glittering skyscrapers. Whichever you choose, however, the game's story will shunt you onto an identical path within the first couple of hours. Beyond those dialogue options, which do not change the story, there appears to be little that's unique between the three paths.These opening hours are the game at its best, however - and make no mistake, Cyberpunk 2077's best is very good. The intro quickly introduces you to Jackie Welles, your partner in crime. Jackie showcases CDPR's talent for writing loveable brutes, and your missions with him over the first ten hours are some of the most fun in the game. There's a rip-roaring momentum to these missions as well, pulling you through a large chunk of the main story better than any other open world singleplayer game in recent memory. This is in spite of, or maybe because of, the stakes always being personal. The cyberpunk genre owes as much to noir detective stories as it does to science fiction, and as in those stories, Cyberpunk 2077 pitches against a world you have little hope of changing. You want to survive, you want to be remembered - or, a lot of the time, you just want to help your friends.Jackie is eventually joined by a larger cast of criminal sidekicks, mission givers and potential romances, and I found each of them likeable and interesting. It's in these relationships that the comparison to Grand Theft Auto is most stark, because of how differently both games approach a similar structure. Where Grand Theft Auto is relentlessly cynical and nihilistic, making you do terrible things for terrible people in every mission, Cyberpunk 2077 seems optimistic about humanity - and particularly people in the lower echelons of society. ""Corporations are bad"" isn't a nuanced argument and neither is ""people are good"", but I enjoyed spending 40 hours with people who enjoyed spending time with each other.When the momentum breaks at the ten hour mark, it's an opportunity to explore Night City. Around the same time, your car will be damaged and inaccessible for a while. Resist the temptation to buy a new one or fast travel and walk everywhere instead. Wander down the back alleys to find lantern-lit markets, gaze up at greeble-covered skyscrapers and staggering statues. The world is built upon decades of worldbuilding already done on Mike Pondsmith's Cyberpunk TTRPG, and it shows in the detail and history visible in each of the city's districts. It's maybe the best walking sim ever made. The other reason for this slowed pace is to nudge you towards the game's side quests. There are dozens, including every kind you'd expect from a modern open world game, but among them are three chains of optional missions that are as involved as anything in the main plotline, and which can have a bearing on the game's story. Structurally, I think this is a great idea - Cyberpunk 2077's main story can be completed in a zippy 20 hours if you want it to be, but these critical side quests can almost double its length.Unfortunately, this is where the most serious bugs reared their heads for me. RPS was not provided with early review code (""the review they didn't want you to read"" - 7/10), and so all my play time was after the day one patch, yet there were two chains of side quests that bugs rendered completely or partially unplayable. One simply did not trigger at all, while I had to abandon the other because it would crash to desktop at the same point on every attempt.This is on top of several other game stopping bugs that forced me to reload old saves, as when critical NPCs would get stuck on scenery, and possibly hundreds more superficial glitches. I've seen NPCs phase through walls, I've been catapulted 200 meters while trying to climb through a window. I've had phone calls where the 'answer' button wouldn't work, and some that happened on top of other phone calls that were already ongoing, with bits of mission critical dialogue crashing into each other. Objects floating in mid-air, characters fixed in T-poses, pedestrians who can't walk up stairs... Ultimately, these affected my enjoyment of the game only a little. Of greater impact were all the other systems that seem incomplete or poorly designed.I mentioned before that pedestrians couldn't pathfind around a parked car. Traffic will also not navigate around a parked car - or worse, around world geometry. Every car seems to drive as if on a single scripted path, and in places where that path hews too close to a wall, every car will simply strike the wall. If you're in an AI-controlled car that's in a tight space, it will spin as if on a turntable rather than be bound by the physics of the world. When you do the driving yourself - which you will do a lot over the course of the game - the driving most often feels like nothing at all regardless of the type of vehicle you're in or the surface you're on. The bugs almost feel like a smokescreen, an optical hack to distract from the game's largest problem, which is that its combat and RPG systems never cohere. As V, you'll need to fight or sneak past the various gangs of Night City. One mission asks you to sneak through a shopping mall filled by the Animals, a gang of roidraging animal fanciers who look like they're the striving children of Wolf from off of Gladiator. Another has you blasting away the Maelstrom, who look like their personal awakening happened the moment they saw Babyface from Toy Story 1. (I mean, look at their gang logo.)The stealthing and blasting is your choice in each instance, and your success at either will be shaped in part by your weapons, cyberware, and your allocated attribute and perk points. None of this is well explained by the game, but it's firmly in Borderlands territory. Enemies are bullet sponges that take half a dozen headshots or more to kill, and they drop guns you'll scour for better damage-per-second stats. I'm not the biggest fan of systems like this, which replace the innate satisfaction of aiming and shooting for a dopamine drip of ever bigger numbers, and much of the game felt like a slog until the digits were in the 200s.HELLO. I KNOW YOU DIDN'T PICK UP BUT HERE I AM ANYWAY, LOOKING LIKE AN AGENT 47 MADE OUT OF TREBOR SOFT MINTS. SORRY, WERE YOU IN THE MIDDLE OF ANOTHER CONVERSATION? I'LL TALK OVER THEM, DON'T WORRY. ONE OF MY STUPID BORING AI CAR SIDE MISSIONS IS NEARBY, AS ALWAYS. BYE NOW WILL CALL AGAIN IN 3 MINUTES CHEERS.My preference in games like this is always to play stealthily, anyway. I want to sneak, to hack, and to preferably leave everyone alive. Cyberware, which can be purchased and installed by cyber surgeons around the city called ripperdocs, can tweak your abilities. I had an implant that made all my guns non-lethal, somehow stopping my shotgun bullets from finishing people off unless I shot them a final time when they were already downed. It feels like a cheat to make a Dishonored-style ""no-kill"" playthrough technically possible, without any of the ingenuity or satisfaction such a playstyle normally brings.Then there's attribute points, which can be spent across five categories and grant access to the perks inside. I initially focused on the ""Cool"" attribute, where the stealth perks lie, but the game's systems for sneaking often feel too thin to make this a valid way of approaching the game. Enemy sight cones are hard to discern, alerting one person often alerts everyone, and there's rarely an opportunity to reset guards to an unalert state short of reloading an older save. Instead, I more often than not fell back on straightforward combat when my attempts at sneaking were rumbled.Most disappointing are the perks themselves. There are seemingly a hundred of them or more, spread across several trees under each attribute, but they're almost all tiny stats changes that I can never bring myself to be excited about. 'Handguns do 3% more damage', '5% increase in chance to crit when attacking from stealth', '10% movement speed increase after stealth takedown.' The perks for hacking, engineering, gunning and movement are all similarly uninspiring. I ended up keeping my points in reserve for when specific opportunities arose to use a particular skill, such as when a door required a minimum level of Body or of Engineering to be broken or hacked open.I'd bet good money there's a way to spend your points surgically and stack them towards a particular, extreme and powerful build, one that combines with certain weapons and certain cyberware to do ridiculous things. I don't know how you'd know how to do that short of waiting for the guide artists to tell you, particularly given there's no way to re-assign attribute points and re-assigning perk points costs a staggering 100,000 of the in-game currency.Not that it matters, ultimately. The game doesn't want to tie your ability to advance the story to these progression systems anyway, meaning your choices in how you engage with them are broadly meaningless. I was 25 hours in before I realised that I should probably switch from the clothes I found in the first hour to items with a higher armour rating, but after I dropped casual trousers with an armour rating of 4 and hiked up a business skirt with an armour rating of 40, I didn't really notice any difference. As an RPG or a Deus Ex, it's one big shrug.Of the game's many systems, it's only hacking that I think coalesces into something satisfying. Quickhacks are, as they sound, of-the-moment abilities that let you switch off cameras, cause vending machines to vomit their canned guts to distract enemies, or damage enemies directly. It's the closest the game came for me to a satisfying use of stealth mechanics, letting me sneak past enemies by temporarily disabling their ocular implants.You can also 'breach' enemies or jack into certain machinery to play a hacking minigame, which asks you to pick chains of alphanumeric characters from a grid within a time limit. It's mostly optional, and mostly rewarding, at least until you find the upgrades that make it trivial. It's not quite hacking, but lastly on the cyberfront, there are braindances, or BDs. These are Cyberpunk's detective mode, first-person recordings of people's lived experiences which you can visit in virtual reality when the plot requires it. You drop into an editor mode during playback that lets you scrub through the timeline and scan visual, audio and heat information from the scene, delivering clues which further whatever crime you're investigating or preparing to commit. It's straightforward stuff, but using it to plot a heist is also fantastically cool. I'd have gladly played with it another half dozen times than the handful the story allowed me - though be warned that at release the intro to these sequences was a seizure risk, and I can't confirm that subsequent updates have addressed it.At this point I feel like I'm just listing stuff in the game, desperate to cover it all. Cyberpunk 2077 is huge, sprawling, complex, and deeply flawed. It's at its best as a fairly straightforward singleplayer action game, with likable characters and thrilling capers in a fascinatingly detailed open world that looks better than any game before it. It's at its worst if you want it to be an RPG, an approach-as-you-please Deus Ex successor, or a polished piece of software. I enjoyed my time with it a lot, and I even want more of it, though I'm going to spend years complaining about its flaws. I'll enjoy the complaining, too.It reminds me of the Eurojank games of yore, then, but maybe it's fairer to say that it reminds me of the previous games from developers CD Projekt Red. After eight years of one of the most grating marketing campaigns imaginable, Cyberpunk 2077 is here, its ambitions beyond its means.

Cyberpunk 2077,Ron Burke,GamingTrend,https://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/well-night-city-is-on-fire-now-what-cyberpunk-2077-review/,"I remember seeing the first trailer of Cyberpunk 2077 and thinking to myself, “This is finally the Neuromancer remake I’ve always wanted”. Seeing the reveal of Johnny Silverhand as your brain-slotted ever-present companion reminded me of Dixie Flatline from Gibson’s novel. Finally seeing the game in motion a few years later confirmed everything I had hoped — this was the cyber-dystopian game I had wished for over the years, and it would finally be brought to life by a team worthy of the task. A delay, more hype, more delays, more hype, leaks, more hype, Night City Wire, more hype, but we are finally here. As I’ve only had access to the game for a short while, I’ll be taking my time to really coalesce my thoughts before rendering final judgement, but based on what I’ve seen so far…yeah, it lives up to the hype, and yeah, it was worth the wait, but I can’t help but feel like we should have waited a little bit longer. This game needed a little more time in the oven, choomba.As always, I’ll do my level best to be as light a touch with spoilers as I possibly can be. I will not reveal anything that would compromise your enjoyment of the game or ruin story twists and turns. That said, let’s get into it.I’m tackling my review of Cyberpunk 2077 on PC, running on an Intel i7 10700 processor, 32GB of DDR4 at 3600Mhz, a GeForce RTX 3080, and an NVMe drive, it should be a top end example of how this game performs. I’ll be doing additional analysis of how the game performs on other cards and adding it to our benchmarking suite, but for my first playthrough, that’s the specs involved. David is tackling the game on the Stadia, which is running some level of the PC version built for streaming. Your mileage may vary, but as it stands, these two versions are currently the best way to play Cyberpunk 2077.Cyberpunk 2077 is the story of V, but who V is ends up being the sum of your choices both large and small. The game starts with four difficulty levels to choose from — easy, normal, hard, and very hard. These affect the amount of weapons and tactics enemies employ against you, as well as their general toughness. The game states on Normal that “only enemies at a higher level will prove a challenge”, and that stays fairly true throughout the game. The beginning hours were the most difficult, with little equipment and enemies all higher level than you. After that, the main quest will provide a decent challenge while still feeling fair. Once you reach the endgame though, with tons of unique and powerful weapons from side quests, combat becomes trivial with only the rare cyberpsycho posing any challenge. It may be worth bumping up the difficulty once you finish the game to avoid this.With your difficulty selected, your next choice is to decide your “life path”, Nomad, Corpo, or Streetkid. Streetkid is precisely what it sounds like — you were raised on the streets by the people of the streets. The Nomad folks are raised outside the city, priding themselves on being away from all the noise and light, and somehow ending up better raised (if not a little more poor) as a result. Corpo types are cold as steel and armed to the teeth. They embrace their wetware, they embrace their ivory towers, and they are as ruthless as they are rich. Surprisingly, these three choices converge almost immediately, meaning no matter where you start, in an hour or two, you are all in the same place. This reduces the importance of this origin story down to dialogue options that you might not otherwise have. In Witcher III style, choices made today can directly impact the options of tomorrow, and the permutations are seemingly endless, though they are not nearly as deep or impactful as the run up to release suggested. For those who like to roleplay they serve their purpose with frequent dialogue options in different situations, but aside from a few quests exclusive to each life path and starting equipment they all feel very much the same.With your background chosen, you’ll now create your own V. Choosing from male or female, you’ll be presented with a wealth of options, including several presets if you aren’t overly concerned with this sort of thing. Options like voice tone, skin tone and type, hairstyle (we’ll get back to that), hair color, eyes, beard style and color, cosmetic cyberware (lines on the face, usually), facial scars or tattoos, nose, mouth, eyebrows, piercings, nipples being turned on or off (uh..what?), nails, teeth, and even the size and shape of your sex organs (Only one type of vagina though, and no options for body type like removing breasts on the typical female body or adding them to the male), though you can disable the latter entirely if you wish. It’s a hell of a lot of detail for a game set in first person, with only the briefest of moments showing off your V avatar. You can even adjust the color and condition of your teeth. It’s crazy how detailed this ended up being, though there’s obviously room for options like non-binary. Still, it’s a step forward, infinitesimally small as it is, and I’m not going to ignore that — representation is important, even if it doesn’t affect me directly. Unfortunately, the game has some missteps around identity, but we’ll get to that in a bit.Cyberpunk is an RPG to its core, and given the pen and paper roots, that’s no surprise. As such, the next choice you’ll make is attributes. Attributes in Cyberpunk are sliced into five categories: Body (overall health, melee damage, etc.), Intelligence (your Cyberdeck RAM capacity, quickhack damage, and duration), Reflexes (reflexes, evasion, increased crit chance, damage from Mantis Blades), Technical Ability (unlocking doors, using Tech weapons, armor), and finally, Cool. Cool raises your overall critical hit damage, controls resistances, increases stealth damage, reduces how fast enemies spot you in stealth, and increases the damage done by your monowire. While this might seem like where you’ll want to spend a great deal of time, ultimately these are more gateways to other things. Having a high cool skill might get you past a conversation with a bouncer. Reflexes might let you dodge an incoming punch. Technical ability might open a hatch otherwise sealed. These aren’t just stat checks, but more drive the storyline in directions you’d expect from an RPG. It isn’t as deep as you might expect from the excessive pre-release buzz, but it offers a few otherwise inaccessible branches, as well as some additional specialization along the way that we won’t spoil here.If you liked the Hairworks implementation of the Witcher III, you’ll like what’s on display for Cyberpunk 2077. Night City is filled to the brim with NPCs, and with every color hair and style you can imagine. A lot of games will “paint” on hair, leaving it close cropped on the character model to reduce the hit on resources. Well, that ain’t Cyberpunk 2077. Here you’ve got short dreads, man buns, massive afros, bouncy curls, spikes, crew cuts, Karen hair, braids of every length, brush cuts, shoulder length, ponytails, high and tight, and many more. Those curls bounce, hair reacts to movement, and let light flow through them to create realistic shadows. There are 78 hairstyles alone, unfortunately split between the two supported genders- 39 for male and 39 for female. While it’s unfortunate that you can’t mix and match, hair is so varied and gorgeously rendered that I’d be surprised if you couldn’t find at least one you like. Make sure you’re happy with your version of V though, because as far as we know there is no way to re-customize them once the game’s started. It’s a strange oversight considering how much the game focuses on body modification, and I should be able to buy a new gender from a vending machine, dang it!Ray tracing in Cyberpunk 2077 is dialed up to 11, and it manifests in several different ways. Ray traced reflections are the most obvious, with character models, cars, buildings, and more reflected in water pools and off shiny objects like cars. Complimenting this is ray traced shadows that lets light cast across objects and drop a realistically distorted shadow underneath. This can be a character model standing in the hot sun, but it also manifests at night when overhead lights bend and shift around moving objects like your motorcycle as it zips through the streets. You really see this in neon-soaked hallways as players disrupt the direct light sources. This leads directly into ray traced direct lighting (RTXDI). With RTXDI, every light in the environment is able to cast shadow, and RTXDI tells the game’s rendering engine precisely where to send those rays. This is part of the magic that lets developers bring as many lights as they wish, allowing both the light and shadow to render in real time.Ray traced global illumination is one of the areas where ray tracing is most noticeable, though you may not realize you are looking at it. With global illumination turned off you get very dark shadows, despite strong light sources sitting just off to the side, creating artificial shadows. Global illumination creates soft lighting and soft shadows, allowing the light rays to bounce realistically through the environment. It creates the difference between a little shadow and a lot, and lets the developers differentiate and use them both accordingly, and in real time. Seeing a stack of money being slid across a desk, and recognizing that the light is causing the shadows to curl up at the edges due to the angle of said light really reminds you that you need to stop and smell the flowers a bit. What’s on display here is magnificent.The last RTX goodie under the hood for lighting is ray traced ambient occlusion. This technology is a vast improvement over previous technologies like screen-space ambient occlusion (SSAO), allowing reflected light to bounce to other surfaces, creating a perceived direct brightness from something that is essentially “out of frame”. In Cyberpunk you see this when you enter a club and the purple neon bounces off of the environment, making the white chairs appear purple on only the side facing the light source origin as light shouldn’t simply ‘bathe’ an object and turn it purple. Instead, you’ll see the light on the surface, the shadow underneath darkening gradually, and the purple fading completely as you move under the chair as light doesn’t reach there. It’s a LOT to think about, and that’s just one light of a great many. With RTX enabled, this is accomplished throughout the entire scene, with the developers able to tune the intensity, how many lights, how much noise it casts into the scene, how far that penetrates and much more. Who knew shining a light on a chair could be so complex?When you combine all of this together you get amazing Blade Runner-inspired moments where a room that is gold from top to bottom reflects every light in the environment, sure, but also casts over the characters walking through it, creating realistically distorted reflections of the high-poly character models. The smallest imperfections in the flooring further distort the image. It’s impressive just how much detail the team has packed into single scenes. I cannot for the life of me imagine playing this without RTX on — once you see it enabled, there’s no going back. The Stadia version of the game appears to have RTX on as well, in both performance and visual mode, which makes it a great alternative if your PC rig can’t quite run the game at peak performance.Cyberpunk 2077 oozes with detail that soaks into every part of the world. One example might be fashion and vehicles. Styles in Night City fall into four categories, and you see it heavily reflected as you encounter certain individuals — a visual representation of what the residents of these areas, and where their interests might align. Kitsch is what you might consider how the “regular” folks dress. Flashy for sure, and neon-soaked no doubt, but Kisch places style over function. It’s the Final Fantasy of fashion, with extra belts, shiny chrome everywhere, and ultra bright colors. Entropism is how the “people with jobs” dress. For the folks living hand-to-mouth out in the wastelands, fashion isn’t their primary concern. Maybe it’s clothes from the last decade, or perhaps it’s the grimy coveralls they need for work, people in this category just want to live their lives. They drive what they can afford, with their vehicles being cobbled together from scraps. You’d call them the Working Man. Neomilitarism isn’t all camouflage like the name would suggest. No, these are the dark shadows that you know are behind you, but you don’t see until it’s too late. Blended with the highest high-end tech and sleek corporate fashion, Neomilitarists are upward bound and don’t have time for the likes of you. You see this reflected in their massive tank-like armored vehicles — they are more function over form, as long as that function comes in black. Neokitsch feels like a blend of Mike Tyson’s crazy mixed with high-end couture runway and a dash of elitism for color. These are the upper crust folks who chase the brightest stars, drive the flashiest cars, and drink at the best bars. Ultrarich, these folks live in a completely different world than you and I. The complaint, of course, is that it’s all window dressing. If you chase the stats, you’ll end up looking like a circus clown in sequined hotpants. Options to look cool are few and far between if you want the other stats on your equipment to actually matter.Cool has less to do with how cool you are (though that’s still part of it), and more so how well you can keep your cool. Basically, how “together” your character is, just like in the tabletop game, though with the attractiveness stat rolled in for good measure. Cool isn’t the only stat for those who would rather talk than start a gun fight — every stat and skill has their chance to shine. One moment you might be hacking a credit chip to remove a virus and not make the group you’re paying off angry, the next you could be ripping a door off its hinges to open an alternate route past some guards. There are myriad solutions to most problems Cyberpunk’s quests will present you with, and while the differences in what actually happens next plot-wise can sometimes change very little the sheer wealth of options has me already wanting to dive back in with a completely different build.Before we get further into this review-in-progress, I want to pause and commend the team on an absolutely phenomenal soundtrack. No matter what kind of music you like, there’s something here for you here. Don’t take my word for it — check it out on Spotify for yourself.Quests in Night City will test your skills in all manner of ways. Quite a lot of these merc missions are just talking to people, which is a nice change of pace. One I really enjoyed sees V consoling a former member of the NCPD, who quit the force after his friend died and hasn’t left his apartment since. How you talk to both him and his friends can drastically alter his fate, these little moments are some of the best parts of the game. The main quest is good enough in its own right, V and Johnny Silverhand’s (read: Keanu Reeves) interactions are especially interesting, but its length doesn’t allow your choices to have the same weight. Your decisions only come into play right at the very end, and even then it only affects the final mission; the actual ending is a completely different choice. This makes me wonder if we even need main stories in open world games like this, when the side quests are the greater highlight. The amount of choices and how they change the ending here is nice, but I found they end up feeling a bit flat with the story going exactly how you expect. Heck, the most interesting ending (aside from the secret ending, which we could not get due to Johnny’s poorly explained approval rating) skips the finale entirely. Personally, I would have preferred a single, strongly written conclusion rather than multiple, weaker ones. Writing and voice acting are, however, excellent across the board, even if I do have problems with the former we’ll get to in a bit.In the first hour of the game I spotted three people in T-pose, one guy eating an invisible hamburger, and bizarre hyper-speed running NPCs. Sometimes people you shoot square in the forehead will lay on the ground like you simply punched them in the stomach. Let’s be clear here: this game is not finished. You are almost constantly fighting against bugs like NPCs who won’t talk to you, keep running into walls, or contradict the story by being in two places at once. Hopefully the developers will continue to patch the game (after a well earned break and in better working conditions), but the question is how much can they fix with patches and how many of the problems are simply baked in at this point? You can probably fix your character’s dick falling off in romance scenes, but what about Night City’s lack of a gang problem? If this city is so dangerous, why is it that there are never any non-scripted gang fights, corpo assassinations, or literally any crime at all outside of my lack of road safety? How about that promise of each weapon becoming better as your character uses it more? What about the fact you can’t leave combat without running far, far away? The fact straight female characters have a single romance option, and that isn’t likely a valid choice for most players, or the jenky-ness of melee combat? Only time will tell if 2077 will become the game that was promised in the marketing, but the base is there; it just needs a little love, care, and a whole lot of time. Stability and performance should obviously be the priority here, but are they willing to go the extra mile and make this more like Deus Ex but with fancy graphics?There are a lot of things that frankly haven’t come together in the final product versus what we were pitched. Night City Wire promised a deep interaction between the various gangs of Night City, suggesting that somehow making one angry will make the others come after you, or that cops would patrol the city, giving you additional scrutiny if you aligned with one over the other. None of that happens in any meaningful way outside of a handful of quests. Most of the time the people walking around the city, gang member or hapless citizen, are simply wandering from here to there, or sitting there waiting for you to shoot them. NPCs feel lifeless, and the vast majority of shops are window dressing. See that awesome looking neon-soaked noodle joint with the fancy sign beckoning you to come in and sample some version of Night City tonkatsu? Well, you can’t interact with them or the thousands of other people. For as packed as Night City is, it’s also somehow a ghost town.As fun as Cyberpunk 2077 is, it has many, many issues that are just inexcusable. For one you can’t rebind most of the controls, like the interact key F, ESC to close menus, and all of the keys to open any menu. The accessibility options that do exist are less than the bare minimum, such as color blind modes and turning on subtitles, you can’t even change the font size or change aim down sights to a toggle. Some dialogue simply doesn’t have subtitles either.. There’s also the issue of the game causing seizures with flashing white and red lights before every single braindance sequence, as well as flashing, glitchy visuals happening randomly as you progress in the story and sometimes it just glitches out with the whole screen flashing white for a few seconds. Even as an able bodied person, these moments were hard to look at. Frankly, I’m astonished this game got through certification, someone completely failed to do their job and Cyberpunk should not have been released in this state.Furthermore, there are several thematic issues present in the game. Cyberpunk certainly has the “cyber” part of the genre down pat, but the “punk”? Less so. There are so many times where the game comes so close to having a message, saying something, anything about our present day world but always shies away from it so as not to piss anyone off. While the game places a lot of focus on the vices of sex and violence, they function entirely as set dressing. There are sex workers everywhere in Night City, but they only serve to titillate the presumably straight, cis, male player. While there is nudity, which can be disabled in the settings, the game will only ever show you female nudity outside of your own character. In several story quests, the game comes inches away from saying sex work should be decriminalized to combat poor working conditions, pay, and abuse, but chickens out in favor of shock value or simply allowing the player to ignore it. In these same quests, at least one of the major antagonists is heavily queer coded, presenting as a man with feminine mannerisms and dress. The game attempts inclusion by allowing you to choose body type and genitals separately, but for some reason pronouns are tied to the voice you choose. This is shameful for a game so heavily focused on body modification and freedom of expression considering I have only found two positive portrayals of a queer character. There are a few optional notes and conversations about the healthcare system and capitalism, but these are mostly used as jokes. The game feels hollow with no message anywhere, outside of not wanting to be forgotten when you die, and I wish it would say something, even if it makes me mad. I don’t want to be preached at, but I do want what is otherwise great writing to have more depth to it. Night City is supposed to be a cruel mistress, but what we find here is merely neglected, or at best, disaffected in its current state. It’s not that the city doesn’t care about you, it’s that it seems to exist in some sort of sterile minimally-interactive state that neither endangers, enrages, asks a meaningful question, or somehow pushes the envelope. If games are truly art, we should hold them to a much higher standard than this.We also can’t in good conscience write this review without bringing attention to CDPR’s crunch problem. While it’s hardly unique in this industry, with good planning and project management, crunch should not be a necessary part of game development, because no game is worth it if it takes human suffering to complete. The marketing surrounding 2077 has been misaimed as well, to say the least. The controversial Mix it Up advertisement is everywhere in the game with essentially no commentary aside from simply shoving it in your face constantly, ‘cuz capitalism. This would have been an opportunity for Cyberpunk to point out how a corporation would use a shocking visual or a mixed metaphor for exploitive sex work, but it does neither. Thankfully the contest winner’s cosplay (who is a cis woman) is not present in the game as far as we can tell, and the game overall is less “edgy” than the marketing would suggest. While the game is rated M and has a warning for photosensitive people at startup (which it lacked at initial launch), there are also a few other things which deserve forewarning. Enemies like to use the word “cunt” almost constantly, some sidequests contain depictions of suicide, police brutality is frequent and randomly generated across the city, there is one sex scene the player is forced to sit through as part of the main story, glitchy visuals including flashing lights before each Brain Dance sequence, and finally the game depicts some horror scenarios such as loss of sense of self. Originally we were going to write up a list of trigger warnings on a quest by quest basis, but these topics are so frequent and spread throughout the game that players who are sensitive to these themes should keep them in mind during play. Games such as Ikenfell do a fantastic job of warning the player about potentially disturbing themes before a scene and Cyberpunk could use something similar, albeit with a toggle to turn that warning off so as to not spoil any upcoming story elements for those who prefer it.In the end, Cyberpunk 2077 is an absolutely gorgeous game in search of a soul, which is ironic, given the duality of the protagonist’s situation. The developers worked extraordinarily hard on what’s here, polishing it to an absolutely gorgeous shine on PC, delivering stunning visuals…when they work correctly. They also delivered a game that is a great deal of fun at some moments, and bafflingly broken the next. With over 30 GB of updates since launch, this game needs more time in the oven. Sure, it’s better on PC, but that’s cold comfort when it’s hardly functional on other platforms. What’s clear is that this game is no more ready for release than it is for review. Major patches are already slated for January and February, and we’ll revisit it at that time to score it. Right now, buyer beware. There’s a fun game underneath all this, but only if you are playing on PC or Stadia.I don’t know what it’ll take for publishers to realize that this is not healthy. It’s bad for the people involved (who will be crunching over their holidays and well beyond instead of enjoying time with their families), it’s cost them over a billion dollars so far, and it has damaged the long-term faith and trust of a willing audience. This game could have been a late-entry Game of the Year, but instead it’s just meme-bait in its current state. You promised we’d burn the city. Well, congratulations — it’s on fire.

But the so-called hype train can be an unstoppable force when it leaves the station and eventually it can catch so much momentum that it remains impossible to not get swept up in (and then flattened by) it.By now, we’re sure you know the story, Cyberpunk 2077 released to much fanfare in December 2020, then fury – almost immediately. It was horribly buggy, Keanu Reeves looked like a melted candle, Night City was deserted and then your console would hard crash, sometimes repeatedly.People were rightly furious that the game they were given was not the game they had stumped upwards of £60 for. It brought up dozens of questions about ethics and transparency in the gaming industry and it all got very ugly, very fast.Multiple patches by CD Projekt RED followed and fixed some issues, but in some cases created entirely new ones. But what about those who swerved all the discord and waited for the long-rumoured next-gen release in the hopes that the game on the PS5 and the Xbox Series would be the game we all hoped it would be?I tested on the Xbox Series S, clocking up just over 25 hours, exploring the majority of Night City and the Eastern and Southern Badlands outside the city limits. I was keeping an eye out for those previous hard-crashes and if any NPCs ended up walking through cars to see if it was a smoother ride from minute one.Read more: Before telling you my experiences with the game, it’s important to note that local raytracing is not enabled on the Series S – but all that means is puddles and shadows don’t look as nice. So, without further ado, here’s what we made of the re-release.Cyberpunk 2077 is a lush, ugly-hot circus You are V, the player character you can create, and you start your journey as either a roaming nomad who lives outside the city, a street kid or a corpo (business suit in the boardroom type of person). Depending on which lifepath you choose, your early missions will differ before you meet your soon-to-be new best friend Jackie Welles, and then everything else kind of becomes irrelevant.Yes, your lifestyle path will open up certain dialogue choices but other than that, your sole purpose is the same – fix the problems caused by a botched heist that turned your life upside down.I am one of those people who gave the game a wide berth first time round for all the reasons listed above, and around 25 hours in (and only five hard crashes) I feel lucky to be in this position, testing a code provided by CD Projekt RED on my Xbox Series S – which doesn’t include the raytracing local shadows feature.Read more: 15 best PS5 games for every kind of playerUnweathered by 14 months of disappointment since the original release I can safely say I am playing something that is more or less what I expected and hoped for. Visually, it mostly looks great, from a distance. If you hone in on some of the finer details then cracks do start to appear. But now, Night City is such a lively, vibrant and pulsating environment that there’s far too much going on to notice that a spot of graffiti on a strip club hasn’t rendered correctly.Where before, Night City was a sprawling, dystopian metropolis that had nobody in it, it is now a circus of illicit activity and unbridled mayhem. And while most of that mayhem is a hoot, some of it is just infuriating, because yes Cyberpunk 2077 is still janky as hell.As V (who I accidentally made look a little like Adam Lambert) I am trying and mostly failing to tow the path of least resistance as much as possible. This becomes even harder when I’m tearing down the street on my motorcycle and mowing down an invisible woman, instantly attracting a huge police presence before the aforementioned motorcycle gets wedged into a wall, and me, unable to escape, shot to ribbons by the cops of Night City in seconds.Keanu Reeves in Cyberpunk 2077The outrageous performance issues are now, thankfully, few and far between though. The next-gen code runs smooth for the most part (I’ve only clocked up five hard-crashes in 20 hours.) One of which kept occurring on the same dialogue option which meant I had to reply to a certain character differently, which in an RPG where what you say can change the story massively, is less than ideal.Even now, Cyberpunk 2077 isn’t the fully-fledged RPG many thought it would be. The choice of which life-path to go on and how to build your own legend are still kind of irrelevant in the grand scheme of it all as you pick up the pieces after a high-stakes heist goes spectacularly wrong.The game presents the illusion of choice quite well but after enough hours you’ll start to see through the cracks and realise that maniacally macheteing your way through a brothel because you spooked one security guard has little to no repercussions. Still it feels cool to do it when you have a thermal mantis blade on the end of your arm.Let’s be clear: Cyberpunk 2077 isn’t reinventing the wheel. The augmentation aspect of the game isn’t executed any better than Deus Ex: Mankind Divided and it feels less intuitive, while the hacking is of a similar level to Watchdogs 2 and Watchdogs: Legion. For some, this next-gen release providing light entertainment more consistently won’t be enough to change their opinion.But for me, exploring this dense megatropolis, driving irresponsibly from place to place (the floaty controls make any alternative just about impossible), and doing cool cyber stuff as part of a pretty-decent-but-not-groundbreaking story, is enough to keep me entertained and engaged long after I should have gone to bed.If you’re looking for discounts on technology or video games, then try one of these codes:Snap up the best Elden Ring deals on PC, Playstation and XboxJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesCyberpunk 2077 is a lush, ugly-hot circus Xbox/CD Projekt REDKeanu Reeves in Cyberpunk 2077CD Projekt RedThe IndependentWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Cyberpunk 2077,Keith Stuart,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/dec/16/cyberpunk-2077-review-cd-projekt,"PC (version tested), Xbox One, Xbox Series S/X, PS5, PS4; CD ProjektBlade Runner meets Grand Theft Auto in this sprawling hellscape of a role-playing game, which is extraordinarily immersive but let down by misogyny and xenophobiaSo here we finally are, in Night City. Almost a decade after it was first announced, CD Projekt’s massively ambitious role-playing game has launched into a swirling maelstrom of hype and controversy that befits its salacious, histrionic setting. Like the technological MacGuffin at the centre of the plot, Cyberpunk 2077 is highly advanced and ingenious, but also bug-ridden and irresponsible.You play as V, a cybernetically enhanced street hustler looking to make their name on these squalid, vicious streets, taking infiltration and assassination jobs for the gangs who’ve carved up the criminal underworld. While attempting to steal a cutting-edge biochip from a powerful corporation, you implant it in your own head, unknowingly infecting yourself with the digital ghost of dead rocker and anarchist Johnny Silverhand (Keanu Reeves, essentially playing Theodore “Ted” Logan’s asshole brother). If you don’t get him out of your brain, you’ll both die.From here, you’re on a hot-wired muscle-car joyride through cyberpunk trope city. There are shady corporations, raincoat-clad hackers and robotic sex workers; there are futuristic penthouses to raid and hi-tech facilities to infiltrate. In the main missions, you ricochet through a complicated plot awash with interesting characters – hitmen, backstreet cyber-surgeons, ruthless club owners – and there are genuinely moving moments along the way as you form relationships with allies and enemies alike.You can play Cyberpunk 2077 as a stealth game, keeping conflict to a minimum by hacking cameras and security droids. But that would be a shame, as the array of weapons, from old-school revolvers to smart rifles, is delicious and the gunplay is excellent. One scene, taking place around an astonishing dashi parade complete with giant holographic fish, feels like a Christopher Nolan sci-fi assassination movie. There’s another, set far out in the dusty wastelands, where you raid a power station in order to set off an ECM pulse that will bring down a passing aircraft. As the vessel begins to lose altitude, you pursue it to its crash site, zooming cross-country on motorbikes – a rip-roaring chase sequence that contrasts wonderfully with the claustrophobic feel of the city.There’s nothing new here, though. The game is heavily based on the Cyberpunk tabletop game by Mike Pondsmith, but the writers have also taken every idea they can from The Fifth Element, Strange Days, Neuromancer, Robocop and, of course, Blade Runner, which has been well and truly stripped for architectural and existential themes. I’ve seen things you people definitely would believe.There are also elements of the genre-defining cyberpunk role-playing game Deus Ex. Like that classic title, Cyberpunk 2077 relies on a vast web of character upgrade and customisation options, which unfurls as you progress. Unfortunately, considering how much time you spend on these screens, actually using them is a disaster. Menus are cluttered and confusing, and comparing weapons or sorting out cybernetic buffs is only ever a chore you get better at rather than a pleasure. In an age where battle royale and collectible card games have made inventory management intuitive, seamless and enjoyable, there’s no excuse for such obtuse design.Night City itself is a pulsating, seductive neon hellscape, part Mos Eisley, part hyperreal satire on failed 1960s urban housing projects. Concrete and steel megastructures rise out of the stinking streets, their exteriors glittering with advertisement screens the size of football pitches. Beneath these corporate monoliths, the masses live in techno shantytowns where neon-lit smog hangs in the fetid air and there’s a fight or a deal under way in every alley. Interacting with things – picking up objects, or frisking downed enemies, for instance – is finicky, but this is a captivating and exhausting place, so thoroughly conceived and dense with activity that, sometimes, you feel like you’re really there. This world is an extraordinary achievement that must have required as much time, effort and sheer will as the construction of a medieval cathedral. God knows the toll it’s taken on the staff, who have been working overtime for most of 2020 to get the game out.Amid the excitement, there are many troubling aspects. How unoriginal of the writers to posit that a technological dystopia will inevitably involve the misogynistic commoditisation of female-presenting bodies, with android sex dolls, gyrating holographic lapdancers and ads for X-rated TV shows with titles such as Watson Whores playing out on every screen. Furthermore, the representation of the powerful Arasaka family as elitist Japanese colonisers revolted by the American way of life recalls the dehumanising “yellow peril” sci-fi of the early 20th century, without ever really interrogating it in a convincing way.As for the bugs we’ve heard about from early reviewers who experienced crashes and character animation freakouts, post-launch updates have calmed the situation a little, but the PlayStation and Xbox versions are still a shameful mess that CD Projekt has rightly apologised for. Ingenious technical tricks conceal some of the shortcomings, but they can’t hide them all. I’m playing on a high-spec PC and, for the most part, it is running smoothly with all the visual settings at high or ultra, but I’ve still seen characters float through walls, and my V spent several minutes with her arms thrust out in front of her like a zombie. I’ve also had side missions that just wouldn’t finish or allow me to pick up a reward, because somehow the end point hadn’t been triggered.It speaks of a game that was absolutely not ready for release – but then, maybe it never would have been. Perhaps the only answer to Cyberpunk 2077’s constant delays was to get it out there and fix it on the fly – a broken business model the industry cannot simply accept. Canny players should wait a few more weeks before diving in, especially on consoles. Even on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X there’s a lot of room for improvement.When it’s working, Cyberpunk 2077 is at once extravagant, ridiculous, sophisticated, silly, hateful and joyous. As an action-packed role-playing game for people who are happy to view the cyberpunk genre as something about robots and hacking and cool guns, it is exhilarating. It tries to have something to say about the corporate dismantling of democracy and the systemisation of our lives as we become slaves to invasive devices and their creators, but never quite manages; it also attempts to explore themes of sexuality and gender in a transhumanist landscape, but in the end that amounts to littering the city with dildo shops and allowing you to romance a couple of same-sex allies. Like a schoolboy studying The Handmaid’s Tale, it shows a vague understanding that dystopias are bad and sexist, but it can’t help giggling at the rude bits anyway.Does Cyberpunk 2077 live up to the hype? Is it significantly deeper than Watch Dogs: Legion or Yakuza: Like a Dragon? Is it as good as Grand Theft Auto V? The answer to all of these questions is no. The sheer size of the world, its astonishing architecture, its set-piece battles, its stylistic bravado – all are testament to the efforts of a talented workforce. But you have to play by its rules, accepting Night City’s xenophobia and misogyny as unavoidable fictive components. Unlike Los Santos, this is not a multifaceted sandbox where you’re free to create whole new activities unforeseen by the designers. You’re there to do missions and side-missions, and the world only yields thus far. You’re always a tourist, never a citizen.In this way, Cyberpunk 2077 resembles a vast, futuristic Las Vegas. You come here and have a hell of a week, but then you wake up one morning feeling jaded and complicit, and you realise that the glitzy signs lead nowhere, the noise is meaningless, and when you look beyond the strip, there is only desert.Cyberpunk 2077 is out now; £49.99"

Here’s how it works.As I write this, I've just completed Cyberpunk 2077, announced all the way back in 2012. After eight years and some notoriously high-profile delays, it feels almost surreal that we're finally here. I am among the lucky few tasked with presenting Cyberpunk 2077 as a player, and despite having written literally thousands of articles, this particular task feels uniquely daunting.Cyberpunk 2077 won't be bested for years — it is a masterpiece.I feel as though I could write thousands upon thousands of words about my time in Night City. The sheer scale of Cyberpunk 2077 as a creative project is simply without precedent. The more I played, the more I began to realize I was experiencing a landmark moment in creative media. Cyberpunk 2077 represents cutting edge technology. It represents the uncompromised vision of Mike Pondsmith's Cyberpunk universe, translated meticulously into video game form. It represents the execution of what is surely among the most gargantuan digitized acting projects in history.Cyberpunk 2077 represents a true leap forward for the medium, with an experience that I'm sure will come with equal parts controversy and admiration. One thing is for certain: nobody will be able to ignore this game. It will be picked apart, scrutinized, and analyzed for years to come. Cyberpunk 2077 is going to hit this industry like an earthquake.After a week or so with the game and dozens of hours played, my honest-to-goodness recommendation is that you don't read this review. Go in blind. Enjoy this moment, and savor its rarity. Simply stated, as an experience, Cyberpunk 2077 won't be bested for years — it is a masterpiece, wholly without equal.$60 (opens in new tab)Bottom line: Cyberpunk 2077 is an open-world masterpiece that features some of the most immersive and liberating storytelling this industry has to offer. With full freedom to choose V's personality, looks, and gameplay style, Cyberpunk 2077 gives the player an unrelenting amount of control in a world that delivers dozens upon dozens of hours of high-quality content. Cyberpunk 2077 is a mammoth achievement and solidifies CD Projekt RED's place at the top of the pile.Jaw-droppingCyberpunk 2077 is an absolutely jaw-dropping game visually, built on a proprietary engine CD Projekt RED made in partnership with NVIDIA and other tech heavyweights. The effort shows in the details of each area and how well the engine handles the transitions between open-world areas and more densely packed interior locations. There are no loading screens save for fast-traveling across the map, and even when moving to an interior area, you can always look out of the window and see the open world, brimming with NPC crowds and moving vehicles. This is the most immersive open-world I have ever experienced. Cyberpunk 2077 is now the standard-bearer for marrying artistic license with cutting-edge technology.I ran Cyberpunk 2077 on my Razer Blade 17 Pro, using an RTX 2070 GPU at 1080p. Cyberpunk 2077 held 60 frames per second easily throughout, perhaps dropping a little when certain weather effects like storms kicked in, but for the most part, it was rock solid. I kept ray tracing turned off to ensure higher performance where possible, but for those with rigs powerful enough for it, Cyberpunk 2077 is a true marvel. You will want the best graphics card you can afford. I may be able to tweak settings even higher in the future. NVIDIA is releasing new drivers soon, specifically for Cyberpunk 2077, and CD Projekt RED is working on further optimization updates that are set to arrive before the game launches on December 10, 2020.From a design perspective, Night City is an open-world playground without equal. CD Projekt RED captured the high-speed and diverse lifestyles of the Western metropolis, alive with bustling market places, seedy red-light districts, downtown skyscrapers, and underbridge slums. You'll traverse to the gang-infested outskirts and beyond into the deserted badlands, where madmaxian outlaws rule the roads from their customized apocalypse rigs. The game's reflections and shadows truly sing at night, particularly so in the rain. Frequently, Night City invites you to take your pedal off the gas and simply spend a few moments gazing in awe at the neon-washed beauty.Night City is remarkable for its verticality, as much as its density. Many missions will take you inside buildings, and despite playing for dozens of hours, I have yet to see the vaguest hint of copy and paste. Megabuildings feel like small cities within cities, reaching up into the sky, plastered with tawdry neon commercials that extend into the clouds like an endless holographic ad reel. The sheer volume of meticulous detailing is almost humbling. Whether it's a stunning vista scorched by the dawning sun or the minutiae in the dashboard interior of one of the game's dozens of vehicle models — the scope of Cyberpunk 2077's detailing is almost daunting.CD Projekt RED's art direction for Cyberpunk 2077 is an example to be followed.Junk food outlets filled with insect burgers and protein paste dot the landscape, as real meat becomes an unaffordable luxury. Vending machines spit out cheap guns to anyone for just a handful of Eurodollars, as the lack of law enforcement forces citizens to take their safety into their own hands. Every corner of this simulation is designed to enhance the game world's believability, and it's all the more immersive for it.As you progress, the story will wind you through each of Night City's districts, in turn, giving you a tour of a dystopia that feels like it could become unsettlingly close to reality. Each district has a distinct visual design based on the inhabitants' culture and the gangs that dwell there. Cyberpunk 2077 is also treated to an incredible and diverse soundtrack, penned by CD Projekt RED heavyweight Marcin Przybyłowicz.Often times, I would simply step out of stealth to listen to the futuristic electro beats that explode when you enter combat. Cyberpunk 2077's music shifts effortlessly between futurism and nostalgia, with various genres represented, strewn through anxious visions of Night City's hyper-tech dystopia.From every pixel to every note, CD Projekt RED's art direction for Cyberpunk 2077 is an example to be followed.So many detailsSet in California in 2077, Night City is one of the last memories of Western opulence. Megacorps now rule the world openly, taking the law into themselves, as ordinary folks are stamped out in the crossfire. With the Night City Police Department utterly overwhelmed, they allow mercenaries to operate freely among the populace, as citizens and corporations take justice into their own hands.Cyberpunk 2077 uses Mike Pondsmith's Cyberpunk tabletop roleplaying universe as its base, giving it a rich, established backstory to draw upon. The game doesn't wait before throwing you in at the deep end, referring to past historical events in detail, complete with unique Night City slang. If you're not familiar with the Cyberpunk lore, it can be disorienting at first, but a few hours in, you'll feel right at home.In this universe, the United States has fallen. In its wake is a loose union of states that somewhat reminisces of the old U.S., but it seems to be anything but in reality. Night City is part of the Free State of North California, making it a unique location for corporations and organized criminal elements to avoid certain legal restrictions.Different companies vie for control of the world, with the Arasaka megacorp taking center stage as Earth's biggest and most powerful organization. Arasaka has its own private military, with orbital stations blanketing the globe in technological tyranny. Other corps like Biotechnica and Militech compete, often violently, with Arasaka, with collateral loss of human life tallied up as a business expense rather than a tragedy.Unrestrained capitalism and the proliferation of cybernetics has degraded the value of the human entity. Shame and privacy are a thing of the past, with sex used openly in all forms of advertising, while addiction to cosmetic and physically-enhancing cybernetics run rife.You play as V, selecting from one of three backstories. Nomad tribes rule the roads between the megacities, handling smuggling and ""logistics"" for different groups looking to transport goods on land. You can also play as a Corpo, as someone who worked within one of Arasaka's cut-throat divisions. Finally, you can be a street kid who grew up among gang warfare in one of the city's slums. Whichever back story you choose can bring consequences and opportunities in equal measure as you wind your way through the game's enthralling plot.Without giving away too much about the plot itself, Cyberpunk 2077 raises the bar so high for digital storytelling in various, critical ways. CD Projekt RED uses several techniques to maintain a sense of immersion, with an attention to detail that is simply rarely attempted by other studios. Cyberpunk 2077 makes very sparse use of repeated, canned animations, with almost every conversation fully choreographed out, complete with unique props as necessary. This extends to big setpiece story missions and even smaller side missions, making it so easy to forget you're playing a game. The vast majority of the game's cutscenes never take control away from the player. If it needs you to sit put for a moment, it'll likely give you a chair to sit on or a railing to lean on.Early on, Cyberpunk 2077 introduces you to the game universe's ""Braindance"" phenomenon. Similar to the movie Total Recall, Braindancing lets you experience the sensations of another individual who has stored their memories or an experience using implants. In some weird way, experiencing these first-person Braindances grounds you into the game's universe. Many people decried Cyberpunk 2077's insistence on a first-person perspective, but it is critical to its storytelling. Without giving away too much, the HUD overlay itself is part of the game's narrative — you're literally seeing the HUD inside V's implants.It's hard to put into words just how many seemingly innocuous details here can have a big impact on the narrative experience. It speaks to the fact, so many of us overlook the importance of body language.In one conversation, I noticed Jackie, V's best friend and partner in crime, had a nervous leg twitch during an important conversation with a potential business partner. I noticed that another character had taken up smoking more frequently in cutscenes after I had offered them a cigarette previously, despite having previously quit the habit. The subtleties in a faraway stare, a frown in response to a particular comment, wringing hands, grinding teeth.All of these small human behaviors are so often consciously lost, and the fact this sort of effort rarely shows up in other games is a testament to the thoughtfulness of CD Projekt RED's design here. I found myself hanging on every character's word. The authenticity in Cyberpunk 2077 is somewhat unprecedented. I found myself tensed up before a dangerous mission, wondering if characters I'd become invested in would survive or not. Life in Night City is not only dangerous but also cheap, and the characters share a common quest to find even a mote of humanity in a world that has become so pervasively material.Night City is a twisted vision of our culture pushed to its most extreme conclusion. The central theme of the game is transhumanism and what exactly it means to be human. Where does the ""Soul"" fit into a world where you can replace virtually every part of your body with machinery? How much of the human experience can be digitized and reduced before it stops being human?Cyberpunk 2077 will solidify CD Projekt RED's legend as one of gaming's greatest-ever storytellers.Cyberpunk asks what the world would look like where the human physical entity is no longer essential, or in some cases, even desired. Life itself is no longer sacred in this world, and that fact permeates every corner of Night City, from its billboards to the corpses that litter the alleyways, forgotten and abandoned to the elements.It's in these questions that Cyberpunk 2077 transcends the vast majority of its competitors, with a plot that is unsanitized and uncompromised, with a confidence that is typically reserved for cinema. Thanks to this fearlessness, CD Projekt RED portrays humanity at its most brutal and most beautiful.It's tough to review a game's story without injecting spoilers, but it really just begs to be experienced. I beg you to go in blind. The authenticity in the choreography and sheer volume of motion capture, the impassioned performances from the game's cast, the moments of raw despair and desperation. All of these coalesce into a beautiful whole and make Cyberpunk's story all the more engrossing and evocative. It's becoming increasingly rare that AAA games actually make me care about the characters they portray, but like Witcher 3 before it, CD Projekt RED shows once again why it is the best in the business.The choices you make, the characters you help, and the factions you anger can have a dramatic impact on the ending you'll receive. My particular ending left me lost for words, and I'm sure yours will differ heavily from mine. One thing is for certain, though. Cyberpunk 2077 will solidify CD Projekt RED's legend as one of gaming's greatest-ever storytellers.A liberating diversity of stylesGameplay-wise, Cyberpunk 2077 bears familiarity with some of the most iconic immersive sims like Deus Ex, with a buffet of character customization affording complete control over your experience.Cyberpunk 2077's attributes breakdown into Intelligence, Tech, Cool, Reflexes, and Body. Each attribute also comes with a perk tree that gives you deeper access the more points you invest in it. Want to play as a stealth ninja wielding tech katanas? Invest in Reflexes for access to blade skills and Cool to deepen your sneaking capabilities. Want to play as a heavy gunner? You can put points in Body for additional strength, and maybe even pick up the Gorilla Arms limb cybernetic to rip doors off their hinges and take turrets out of their bases. Who needs lockpicking anyway?For my playthrough, I wanted to create a Netrunner, which is loosely equivalent to a modern-day computer hacker. Netrunners use all sorts of implants and augmented reality interfaces to poke holes in the Net, which is in a sorry state in 2077's New United States. After several major wars, the internet as we know it has become fragmented.Source: Windows CentralCyberpunk 2077 has so much to see, so much to do, and so many different ways to play.Society has fallen back into closed networks and a heavily sanitized version of the world wide web, policed by virtual law enforcement corps like NetGuard. Players can learn a range of Quick Hacks that can destabilize and debilitate enemy groups, which are often (but not always) connected together into a single subnet, which typically covers specific locations and squads of enemies. To start with, some of the Quick Hacks let you overload an enemy's ear implants, creating sonic interference. Another lets you overload their CPU, causing them to overheat and eventually ignite on fire. Later on, you'll get the ability to control their very thoughts, influencing them to simply shoot themselves in the head, or walk over to an enemy group and detonate a grenade.Every playstyle is catered for nicely in Cyberpunk 2077.If you chose that style of play, you end up rather squishy as a result. Enemy Netrunners may also start to become aware of your presence the more you dig into a group's subnet, and start to counter your hacks, forcing you to take a more proactive approach to combat. To that end, Cyberpunk 2077 has an impressive range of weapons of all shapes and sizes, and for all types of scenarios.Tech weapons line up nicely with the Netrunner playstyle. These weapons shoot some type of radio wave that can penetrate walls and armor, blowing literal holes in enemy hides. They can be rather noisy, though. A stealth approach might include a silenced pistol or sniper rifle, for facing threats from afar or from a shadowy corner. There are mountains of melee weapons too, from throwing knives to katanas, to light machine guns and even old school sawn-off shotguns. Every playstyle is catered for nicely in Cyberpunk 2077, and it also enhances replayability.Speaking of replayability, Cyberpunk 2077's liberating diversity of gameplay styles is also complimented narratively too. Your backstory choice can be used to open up new pathways through quests, or even gain hints about infiltrating a location. Your Body attribute can be used to intimidate people into submission, or your Cool stat can be used to smooth talk someone into doing your bidding.As you grow in power, so does your capability to carve your enemies into bloody chunks. Beyond stats and attributes, you can also enhance yourself further with cybernetics. Some might enhance your Netrunning capabilities, giving you more slots for programs to upload into enemy brains. Others might give you the ability to ""slow down time"" by enhancing your reflexes. Cybernetics that enhance your arms might give you the capability to slice and dice enemies from afar or smash them with boosted strength. All of these enhancements are expensive though, forcing you to do what V does best — mercenary work.Undertaking mercenary jobs is by far the best way to earn cash (Eurodollars) in Cyberpunk 2077. These range from dynamically-generated LAPD contracts that simply ask you to resolve local reports, which might be an assault-in-progress or gang-related activity. Other jobs are called Gigs and are usually more complex tasks given by merc job brokers, known as Fixers. These can range from short delivery missions to quite grand side missions that take place in unique locations, with unique characters. Side missions are generally offered by other characters in the game's story, and come with more bombastic setpiece moments or special character interactions. Then, you have main missions that further the game's plot.The main missions are the game's centerpiece experiences, giving you that little bit extra. Ever present is Johnny Silverhand, famously portrayed by Keanu Reeves, who remarks upon your actions, and in some cases tries to influence them. I'm nowhere near the end, despite having a week and dozens of hours inside Night City already, but it feels like it offers so much more than similar games I've played recently.I feel like I'll be playing this game for months, maybe years to come.I've battled scavengers from the back of a speeding van in the middle of a massive nuclear sandstorm. I've scaled skyscrapers to assassinate snipers in the middle of a holographic parade. I've disguised myself as a corporate stooge and heisted advanced tech from the most powerful corporation in the world. I've carved a bloody path across Nighty City and out into the desert, and I still have the freedom to start over and play the game without killing a single person. I feel like I'll be playing this game for months, maybe years to come, in a similar fashion to your Mass Effects, Skyrims, or Dragon Ages of old, going back over and over to see how else I experience the game's diverging, branching pathways. And despite how positively I feel about Cyberpunk 2077, as you might expect in a game this complex, it's not without its rough edges.There is a range of small problems that hinder Cyberpunk 2077, but by no means break it. The REDengine is completely new, and it presents its immaturity through some of the game's stranger bugs. Sometimes when I summon my vehicle, I've had it drive up and clip through an object, then spontaneously flip into the sky after it realized it was somewhere it wasn't supposed to be. As a stealth character, sometimes I seem to alert an invisible enemy, or something stuck below the floor, causing the entire squad to enter the combat state. One of the most egregious bugs I had hurt one of the game's early emotional scenes, as a character's speech was comedically undermined by a gun that was floating through the air. In a game that's all about immersion, these types of issues can be all-the-more annoying. Another high-profile bug that remains unfixed is the Quick Save feature, which often fails to fully record your enemy's combat state as you move between save files.Update: Since writing this review, CD Projekt RED has issued updates to Cyberpunk 2077 that fix many of the bugs outlined here, including the floating weapons and other engine anomalies.There is a range of small problems that hinder Cyberpunk 2077, but by no means break it.The game doesn't do a particularly great job at explaining some of its systems, either. For example, even after a week's worth of play, I'm still unsure of the exact mechanics of how enemy Netrunners are able to locate you. And even when they do, it doesn't seem like they actually do anything with that information, remaining in a dormant state. Some of the game's weapons seem a tad under-tuned as well. I chose the Nanowire as my main arm implant since I thought it would give me the ability to garrotte enemies, alas, the game only has two stealth takedown animations from what I've found, regardless of the weapon you're using. The Nanowire's previously-advertised remote hacking capabilities seem to have been removed too. Or if they're still in the game, it's not really explained how to use them. Cyberpunk 2077 even has its own irritating Roman Bellic from Grand Theft Auto, who will constantly call you and ask if you can find their missing taxis, instead of going bowling.Source: Windows CentralIt could be seen as a good thing that Cyberpunk 2077 doesn't hold the player's hand, but I can also see the other side of the argument. The lack of information could lead to confusion and frustration. It certainly seems possible to build a character that is full of skills that don't compliment each other well and buying the shards to re-vamp your attributes and perks is incredibly expensive.CD Projekt RED has already dropped a couple of updates on the game during the first wave reviews program, with another update to drop on launch day as well. The updates have gone a long way to fixing many of the issues I had with some of the earlier builds, which bodes well for the future. CD Projekt RED has also proven itself to be diligent at polishing its games, adding in free content and gameplay tweaks based on community feedback to The Witcher 3, and there's no reason to think this won't also be the case with Cyberpunk 2077.An experience without peerIf for whatever reason Cyberpunk 2077 is the last game I ever review, I'll be more than satisfied. Cyberpunk 2077 is a landmark experience that will remain the standard-bearer for immersive play for years to come. Maybe only CD Projekt RED itself will be able to top it.Cyberpunk 2077 is an experience without peer.You can feel the love, the sheer force of will that every developer has poured into this project, which I reiterate, for me, is simply without equal. Regardless of what aspiring censors and opinion peddlers may say about it, I believe Cyberpunk 2077 will stride into the history books with confidence and conviction. Cyberpunk 2077 is a celebration of the entire medium, marrying cutting-edge technical innovation, unrestrained user agency in an authentic and immersive experience that transports you to another universe. No game has executed on the promise of gaming like Cyberpunk 2077. CD Projekt RED's artistic achievement cannot be overstated.Despite an impressive array of bugs and glitches, Cyberpunk 2077 remains an experience without peer. No punches pulled, no platitudes are given, and no compromises are made. Cyberpunk 2077 is an industry highpoint that, simply put, may never be bested. Right now, and without hesitation, I am overjoyed to say Cyberpunk 2077 is everything I've ever wanted from a game. It is the best game I have ever played.The bar has been raisedA landmark achievement.Cyberpunk 2077 is one of the most liberating open worlds in recent memory, with meticulous attention to detail, unprecedented amounts of motion capped scenes and a story that will leave you shaken to your core. The wait for Cyberpunk 2077 was worth it because it is quite easily a candidate for the ""best game ever made.""Jez Corden a Managing Editor at Windows Central, focusing primarily on all things Xbox and gaming.

Cyberpunk 2077,Robert Ramsey,Push Square,http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/cyberpunk-2077,"GuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpCyberpunk 20772022 7.8Game RatingUser Ratings: 329Our Review: Scroll DownPlay it again, JohnnyVersion Reviewed: EuropeanWe called Cyberpunk 2077 ""the single biggest disappointment of the generation"" in our PlayStation 4 review. Harsh words, you might think, but it's easy to forget just how broken the long, long, long awaited role-playing game was at launch back in December 2020. Absolutely plagued with experience-breaking bugs and crippled by a consistent crashing issue, the last-gen version of Cyberpunk 2077 was nothing short of a disaster — a clearly unfinished game.Here we are over a year later, and to be fair to CD Projekt Red, the developer has stuck to its guns. It's spent the last 14 months or so improving and adding to Cyberpunk 2077 — even delaying the PS5 edition of the game beyond 2021, so that it could ensure its overall quality. It's obviously disappointing that it's taken so long to get here, but we're happy to report that Cyberpunk 2077 finally feels like a finished game on PS5.Going by our time with 2077 on PS5, the worst technical issues that ruined the title on PS4 have been dealt with — namely the crashes and the game-breaking bugs. The whole thing looks and runs far better than it ever did on Sony's previous console, and while this certainly doesn't excuse the game's initial state on PS4, it does hammer home the fact that 2077 simply wasn't ready for release. At bare minimum, this is the Cyberpunk that PlayStation fans should have been playing in 2020.As we stressed in the PS4 review, there was real potential buried beneath all the crap — the skeleton of an engrossing dark future RPG. With the PS5 version, this skeleton has been exhumed — and it's actually got some meat on its bones. Er, what we're trying to say is that everything Cyberpunk does is so much easier to appreciate when it's not crashing every 45 minutes, and your quests aren't breaking at random.Is this the unparalleled open world RPG that CDPR had pretty much been promising since its full re-reveal in 2018? Not really — and it probably never will be. But when the game actually works and you're cruising around the neon-soaked streets of Night City, listening to radio bangers on the way to your next mission, it can be so easy to lose yourself in Cyberpunk 2077. It's a brilliantly atmospheric and, at times, deeply engaging adventure.A lot of 2077's strength lies in its unapologetically degenerate setting. Night City is basically hell on earth — a dangerously overcrowded hive of scum and villainy where a stray bullet could end your (likely miserable) life at any time. The game does a fantastic job of making the city feel intimidating at first — like death's always waiting just around the next corner — but this allows for a rewarding character progression curve. With enough completed contracts under your belt, and subsequent access to all kinds of weapons and abilities, you go from prey to predator in this urban jungle.There's a definite power fantasy at the heart of Cyberpunk. Your customisable main character, V, can be built in loads of different ways. You can specialise in guns, stealth, hacking, katanas — and getting to grips specific skills means that you can start wasting goons for looking at you funny. Every time you level up it feels like you're taking another meaningful step towards becoming an invincible Night City legend — and the game's reworked perk system (as of update 1.5) helps a lot in this regard, offering up a better balance of skills and stat buffs.Cyberpunk's gameplay — specifically the combat — starts to blossom as you spend more time with it. Initially, V's unsteady aim with revolvers might be a source of some frustration, but keep using your favourite hand cannon and your proficiency will soon increase — and that same rule applies to every skill in the game. It's not a unique progression system, but it is a very enjoyable one, and again, it feels like you're growing more and more powerful.It also helps that enemies seem to be smarter, non-playable character AI having been noticeably improved with the 1.5 update. Generally speaking, opponents stick to cover a lot more often, bringing a much needed touch of strategy to most encounters.But it's Night City itself that benefits the most from having NPCs upgraded with baseline open world intelligence. Citizens actually run from danger — some even stand and fight! — and you can cause absolute chaos by unloading a few bullets on a busy street. The metropolis no longer feels like a lifeless illusion on PS5, with NPCs and traffic spawning at a greatly increased rate, and — gasp! — reacting to one another. Basic stuff, but it's these little details that make open worlds feel alive — like they would continue to exist even if you weren't around.V's existence is all-important to Cyberpunk's story, however. A heist that goes horribly wrong leaves the smart-talking merc with an experimental chip lodged in his or her head. Said chip houses the digital ghost of Johnny Silverhand — a revolutionary from 50 years ago who made an (ultimately quite futile) stand against one of the world's most tyrannical tech corporations.Many of Cyberpunk's best moments are part of its main narrative — and you can tell that this is where a healthy chunk of the budget went (and not just because Keanu Reeves plays Silverhand). Its core missions are easily some of the most varied and polished escapades in the game, boasting great pacing, carefully designed combat scenarios, and an excellent cast of characters.The main plot's a thrill ride, even if it's a little difficult to follow at points. Cyberpunk's writing is generally sharp and engaging, but it's heavily reliant on in-universe terms and phrases that take some getting used to. While embedding words like 'choom' and 'preem' in just about every conversation does add yet more weight to the game's already amazing world building, sometimes it can feel like you need a glossary to get the gist of what's going down.Fortunately, you're always able to take a breather from the central story missions and roam Night City as you see fit. Optional quests make up for much of Cyberpunk's runtime, and they're usually worth checking out. Alongside full-fat side missions that have their own, typically insane stories to tell, standard 'gigs' have you taking out wanted criminals and retrieving certain items for clients.It's tempting to call them busywork, but a lot of these objectives add to the game's flavour. Some of Cyberpunk's most thought-provoking content is hidden behind these seemingly straightforward contracts, and by engaging with them, you do end up getting a better sense of what Night City is all about. And, of course, it helps that you're always on the downright addictive hunt for loot and precious experience points.Oh, and the open world's pacing is vastly improved as well (thanks again, update 1.5). In the original release, quest givers — known as fixers — would constantly call you up about their latest contracts, to the point where your map would become bloated with mission icons. That's no longer the case on PS5, where fixers roll out gigs one by one. The change makes mercenary life in Night City seem way more organic and manageable.Moving on, we should at least mention the game's DualSense functionality, which is actually surprisingly good. Haptic feedback is utilised well, providing distinct rumbles whether you're driving down a bumpy badlands road or spraying and praying with your favourite machine gun. Likewise, the controller's adaptive triggers tighten to simulate braking and acceleration when you're behind the wheel — although the level of resistance can feel a bit too rigid sometimes.So, Cyberpunk is a much improved experience on PS5, basically across the board — but if you were left feeling short-changed on PS4, beyond the technical issues and cardboard open world, then you should note that this is still the same game. The main story still seems a bit stunted at times, and the role-playing options at your disposal can feel disappointingly limited. It's still best to view Cyberpunk 2077 as an open world Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, or a futuristic (and, to be fair, much more in-depth) Far Cry. With the right expectations, Night City is one heck of a holiday destination.Cyberpunk 2077 on PS5 is the game that PlayStation fans should have been playing in 2020. While it still falls short when measured against the immense expectations that surrounded its release, everything that Cyberpunk gets right is so much easier to enjoy when the game isn't crippled by technical issues. The main story's a thrill ride, the combat's a blast, and Night City is an incredible open world setting. And the best part is that CD Projekt Red finally has a stable foundation to build upon. It took 14 months to get here, but the future of Cyberpunk 2077 actually holds a lot of promise.Great 8/10Scoring PolicyAbout Robert RamseyRobert's been a dedicated PlayStation fan since the days of Tekken 2, and he still loves a good dust up. When he's not practising combos, he's usually getting lost in the latest 100-hour RPG, or, y'know, replaying The Witcher 3.Comments (139)If anyone's got any questions about the game or the review, let me know and I'll try to answer them.Also, sorry it took a solid week to get this review up — we really wanted to get stuck into the game on PS5 to properly review it.One of the big problems on PS4 was that it was incredibly difficult to enjoy the things Cyberpunk got right when it was such a technical mess, so actually being able to take our time with the game makes a huge difference.And I think my big takeaway here is that Cyberpunk can get even better. Very much looking forward to future updates and DLCs now that the game works properly.@ShogunRok great review. I’m glad I didn’t play this on PS4, would be playing it now on PS5, but Forbidden West is so awesome. Will be playing Cyberpunk afterwards.I don't think cyberpunk deserves a second review unless you plan on re reviewing every game after a year or 2 & a bunch of patchesI understand from a financial standpoint why it came out on Ps4 but its a shame they shot thier reputation after the high of Witcher 3. Its good too see them get back on track and hopefully offer some great expansion@Would_you_kindly We reviewed it because it released on a new platform.Yeah been playing it a lot this past week and its pretty clear this should have never been on last gen machines. Its way easier to enjoy and love its pluses when the game isn't a broken mess and looks awful.This kind of open world RPG running at 60 frames is something i was missing and ps4 couldn't provide..it gives me fallout 4 vibes..Unlike other games with horrible launches like Fallout 76 this one always had the potential to be truly great as it actually had a soul and a direction, I feel bad for the developers that got royally bent over this and hopefully they truly achieve what they intended from the start.Not interested in the PS4 version, played the demo last week and liked it enough to spend £20 on the full game on PS5. Despite HFW coming out, I've still been spending time in Night City as a Corpo and am enjoying it.The streets and roads still feel quite empty to me (GTA V it most certainly ain't) but appreciate it for what it is and I think it's s good game, just not the Second Coming that many hoped it would be.I hope they continue to support the game and look to tweak and improve it further, along with new DLC.Oh and whilst online isn't my bag, I think the MP plans have enormous potential. Night City would be a fun place to join a gang, plan some heists, have some shoot-outs and the character customisation could lead to some very 'inventive' creations.😉Well done CDPR, now bring on The Witcher 3 for PS5 and then The Witcher 4!It's a great game so far, already have 20 hours into it but it is still far from what was promised. It'll take a long time to get that and even a sequel for what they were trying to do such as the ""Most Believable city to date"" or choices that matter.I'm one of the few who actually liked it a lot on PS4, though of course the issues were awful. Would really like to revisit it and play it properly again, I just don't know when (or if!) I'll ever have the time, sadly.I played through it twice when it was deemed unplayable. Once on Stadia, once on PC. I recently tried getting back into it for a third and final playthrough, but once you know that basicly everything is fake in the game, and you can influence absolutely nothing, its just... not fun at all.Really great review and will definitely be checking this out once I finally get my hands on a PS5 soon.@get2sammyb so, they also patched the ps4 version? Or they didn’t bother anymore with that.I was not going to bother with this but tried the trial just before HFW released and was pleasantly surprised. So much so that I bought it and will return to it after I’m done with Horizon. It’s good that they got this game most of the way to being where it should have been a year ago and means that all that hard work the developers put in right before and after launch won’t go to waste.Question: does anyone know if the street cred cap has been raised at all? I remember on my original play through last year that I’d gotten to the cap shortly after leaving the first districtWhen CDPR said they were going to set things right I was very doubtful about that but after playing it over the weekend it's hard to believe this is the same game......sort of, you know what I mean.So glad the developers are on the way to redeeming themselves.Removed - unconstructiveGreat to see a full review on the ps5 version. Nice to see major improvements have been made. They really should have waited to release this version from the beginning. Shame its come out alongside dying light 2 and horizon. Itl have to wait for a quieter month before i can play@get2sammyb @clianvXAi Based on what I've seen and read, the PS4 version is much better than it was, especially with the 1.5 update — but it's still heavily limited compared to the new PS5 version. For example, a lot of the AI improvements in 1.5 don't apply to the PS4 version.Great review and I agree on all points. Really been enjoying the game the past week.Article compares it to an open world Deus Ex: MD. Just wanted to say that I think that's more like that's what CDPR tried to do vs what they actually did. If you like immersive sims, don't get your hopes up. CP2077 is a great game, and I enjoyed it, but it's not an imm sim. Hate to be the ""um, actually..."" guy, but I felt obligated to temper this specific expectation.@nomither6 nothing wrong an 8. Considering how the game used to play an 8 is a vast improvement@TBubs311 I don't think so...but I think the distribution of exp and street cred has been rebalanced.I've played about 10 hours and I'm enjoying it so far. I agree with most of the pros. It hasn't really blown me away though and I thought the prologue was quite bad. It gets better once you get into the open world. Convoluted menus is right though. The game doesn't do a great job of explaining how everything works.When you measure it against the marketing it's still a colossal failure though. It's insane how much they did a disservice to their own game by overhyping it. It's a good game that would have sold very well without them lying about it.@Danloaded it was a joke , i forgot that’s not allowed here .This is a great review. I’ll definitely be playing this in the upcoming month(s). I’m deep in HFW and Elden Ring releases very soon, so I won’t have a lot of time to play this, but I will eventually.@nomither6 ah my apologies. There are people who genuinely believe an 8/10 is basically a 4/10 or somethingAn 8/10 for an unfinished game fraudently lied about? Damn.This is where we are. Just have to iron out the technical shortcomings of the unfinished product to get a favorable review.Thanks for reviewing it again. I really enjoyed my time playing it during Christmas 2020 (admittedly on ps5) so was pretty gutted at the 3/10 score as I thought that was overly harsh. Great to see it gain some redemption and the devs get some credit - must have been awful for them being released 'early'.I think a 7 or 8 is about right, lots still to do to improve it but at least it now functions and is a good base for DLC.I'm playing this alongside dying light 2, and whilst I love them both for what they are, the characters in cyberpunk are so much more interesting and memorable.@get2sammyb I also really liked it, granted I played the PS4 version only a couple months ago on PS5. It was practically unplayable in many instances on my PS4 Pro.The PS5 version is so much better though. Definitely a great game!Playing it for the first time, in act 2 and loving it. It's not perfect but it's engrossing and looks great.Genuinely can't understand the people ripping this score as if the warts of the launch version haven't been accounted for and addressed by the people still working on the game. Maybe the idea of going back and correcting their mistakes with reviewers acknowledging these improvements is too big a concept to grasp. Either way it's, at worst, a very good game now.@KundaliniRising333 I get where you're coming from, and CDPR still has a lot to answer for, but I think Cyberpunk is genuinely a pretty great game when it's not an absolute wreck.Is it the amazing, all-conquering RPG that CDPR marketed for years? No, but you can only review what's in front of you, not what you feel should be there.Is there a dedicated PS5 version, or do you just buy the ps4 one and download an update?@ShogunRok I hear thatshould be getting stuck into this in the next month, I already decided to wait for the ps5 update, have a few weeks or destiny to get through firstIt’s very sold and enjoyable in this version. Happy to finally have a version like this 14 months after release. Thrilled to see what’s coming next. The next gen versions are a solid Fundament to build up something more.Even though it is playable, it is still just another boring open world game.Removed - unconstructive; user is banned@MatthewJP I was literally thinking the same thing! I started playing dying light 2 first, thinking the story and characters are not as bad as everyone is saying. After starting CP2077 again, I’m like okay they are pretty bad.@Chinese_Stu Dedicated PS5 version, free upgrade if you own it on PS4.Fantastic review! Totally agree. I hope other sites will give it a new review too.It’ll never be what it should’ve been, but boy is it still freaking awesome.On my 4th playthrough and this time it's well above 720p and 15fps. Absolutely loving it. I've just done the Clouds mission where V opens up to the doll, Skye. Such a great scene.I recommend anybody starting for the first time to play as female V because Cherami Leigh absolutely nails it.@brazzios_84 don't play it then, play something that isn't an open world game.Sheesh.Amazing how a thoroughly mediocre looter shooter garners an 8/10 for suddenly being stable. That is, ONE point below Horizon Forbidden West. Take that in, people. Something with the polish and improvements of nearly every mechanic allows for an arguably miraculous vaulting of the bar set by it's predecessor surmounts this middling, though thankfully now-extinguished, dumpster fire by a mere single point. The long march of the editorial staff toward absurdity continues unabated.@ApostateMage loving this playthrough as female V. Any tips on dealing with cyberpsychos without killing them? I remember originally they wasn't even marked on the map, now they are. Did one but killed her...The butthurt of some people still unable to get over CP2077 is mind-numbing... We get it, you hate the game and the devs. Go peddle your whining somewhere else. On topic: I'm on my 3rd playthrough and loving it. Everything feels so much better now on PS5.Removed - flaming/arguing@JohnGrey Sir, this is a Wendy's.@bozz At least with Wendy's I expect and welcome mediocrity walking through the door.Great review! The haptics and especially the complete overhaul of the phone system are hugely welcome improvements for me. I also really appreciate the multitude of little additions, like how relevant characters and info regarding your present mission are now consolidated and readily available to browse upon opening the menu. Good stuff!!How does the game implement choices and consequences? I've played about 5 hours and there hasn't been any mention of it. For example, in the first mission where you go to get the Flathead I smoked the guy's crack and told them that Militech wanted to trace them through the cred chip I'd wiped clean. This led them to fight Militech alongside me as allies and they gave me goodies at the end of the mission. Could this have worked out differently, and, without getting too spoilery, would it have longreaching effects to the world and story like in Witcher 3?@gollumb82 ""We get it, you hate the game and the devs. Go peddle your whining somewhere else.""Well to be fair this is an open article where everyone can give their opinion as long as is not breaking any site rules, this is the perfect place to peddle their whinning.I also don't get why the complainers of complainers bother me so much, although I do admit that does make me the complainer of complainers that complain about complainers 😅@Juanalf I'm not who you're replying to but it feels like this is a game where a subset of the population has their minds set on an opinion based on how the launch went and it's near impossible to change that stance no matter how the game improves.Yeah, it was launched as a broken product by some scummy folks, we all know this. But since then the team in charge has rolled out some meaningful improvements that make it a genuinely enjoyable game, both to play and look at. It's not perfect but it's still better than a large number of games that launched in perfect condition. Both can be true, that it was once a disaster but has now become something very good. People should be open to change.@voogles thanks for breaking the illusion for everyone who's been waiting to play on PS5! /s@JohnGrey crazy how opinions work, huh. It's as if this person is speaking for themselves, and not the community. You can always go back to the 2020 review and feel good about yourself?@Juanalf I was about to reply, but @bozz said what I wanted to say. Exactly what I think 🙂@MatthewJP I'm sure you can just put them down like any old thug as long as you don't touch them when they're squirming on the floor. I think the katanas have finishing moves (beheading) so maybe avoid using a melee weapon when they're low on health.Ooh, how turnsed the tabled@PhhhCough That's sort of the issue, though, they do speak for a particular community, namely the PushSquare publication as a whole. The revolving door of reviewers means that PS lacks any sort of editorial or critical consistency. They're not the first or last to suffer from it, but that doesn't mean ridiculous inconsistencies shouldn't be pointed out.Ps5 Version even with a more stable framerate as Series X…@bozz People should be open to change.Perhaps the changes don't address the fundamental problems that people have with the game. ""People"" should recognise that for some a fumigation and stable frame rate do not a good game make.@JohnGrey They've addressed a number of fundamental problems, this has been documented at more outlets than just PushSquare. It's up to you to both brush up on this and accept it while also noting that outlets like this one are still saying that it's not a perfect game. Or just be as you were and glass half empty, it's your call.Again, that's my problem with this review.8/10 does not equal ""not a perfect game but still good""
8/10 is just below Horizon Forbidden West. It's the same score given to Spider-Man: Miles Morales. To Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart. To put CP2077 in its current state against the quality of either of those games is laughable.It's not being glass half empty, it's about deciding what's important to you. Some people can tolerate schlock films. Some people listen to Captain Beefheart unironically. My problem is not with people's tastes. My problem is when Sharknado is elevated to the same level as The Other Man, or the amelodic musical flavour of the week is compared to Billie Holiday, or Albert King, or The Who.@meteors77 there's a few options on that mission. I think the 'best' outcome is to not use the credchip, hack it and gain 10k yourself. Depending on your other choices you can/cannot get a romantic encounter later in the game. Did you save Brick who was locked up too?Good review here. A fantastic game on PS5.Honestly some of the most fun I've had in an RPG since Skyrim and also the most absorbed and invested I've been in a world since The Witcher III (and Skyrim!). Cannot recommend enough I fully expected to be playing Horizon right now but I'm all in on Cyberpunk now. I'm quite glad I waited until the PS5 version to jump in as it definitely sings on the modern hardware.My biggest issues are the menus are a bit unwieldy especially when working on crafting and attachments and what-not. And the review hit the nail on the head with the main quest being a little difficult to follow at times. I do disagree with combat being a blast personally. For me it's serviceable at best.Oh and my V still looks like a weirdo but anyway I'm really enjoying it!@MatthewJP thanks for the info, I didn't save Brick, I meant to let him out but it was all a bit chaotic and I randomly pushed the button which exploded him instead. OopsBought the PS5 version on sale for £20 from the PS Store, which I think is a good deal. It's in my library to dive into after Forbidden West!Be nice if the review included info on new graphics/modes, since this was the main problem during the launch.Otherwise, good to see it in shape now, I’ll get into it after Horizon I think.Nice review. Played it on PC at launch - loved it. Hoping for some expansions now.@meteors77 In terms of choices and consequences the biggest effects will mostly be in the ending, though most main quests have multiple scenarios even if they always end virtually the same. Some of those endings are entirely dependent on what faction you choose. The more side quests you do the more it impacts the final act of the game. It isn't quite Witcher levels but it's more akin to something like Mass Effect mostly@theheadofabroom its more a friendly neighbourhood warning, dont waste your money on a game that plays itself and you can just put down the controller for the same result@MatthewJP use short circuit cyber attack to finish them as its non-lethal. i kept them all alive. theres also a non-lethal mod you can get for your guns cant remember where i got if from though.@meteors77 You can use a weapon mod that makes you bullet unable to kill and only knocks them down or you can use a hack. That resets their system meaning knockout@ShogunRok When you say the role playing is shallow, what do you mean? Are the choices just underwhelming?I feel burned by this game still after they essentially made us pay full price for the beta version. I'll get it whenever it drops to the price you can pick up The Witcher 3 now.@ShogunRok yeah it seems really ok and playable now on std ps4.
Well the crowd ai seems to be the only update not on the ps4 gen from all i read and saw, so you still get all improvements, except of course the smooth clean graphics it seems.
Even enemy ai is supposed to be updated too.I think it's needed to have re-reviews, or at least updates on reviews, as you just did of course, after major updates.
Even the ps4 1.5 update on review would be appreciated a lot.Edit: there's a few new quests only on new gen too.Am I the only one? 3 sessions, 2 crashes and 1 bugged side quest (Claire never contacts about third race, even if I waited over 7 days...) PS5 version of course...Thankfully it's now a working game on console but it sure isn't a great game. I expect more from a roleplaying game than what is delivered and even more from what is promised. I give it a 7.@voogles sure, except a load of us have already bought it (I'm just playing Forbidden West first)@Jaz007 There are some quests where the game makes it seem like you have a choice, but your actions don't really change anything. There are a lot of decisions where you get different dialogue and stuff like that — but the quest just carries on anyway. That's what the shallow role-playing is referring to.Doesn't apply to every choice in the game, though. Especially in the main story missions, a number of choices do actually impact how things pan out, and that goes for the multiple endings too.Despite a lot of criticism, Cyberpunk 2077 is a decent role-playing game. It's not as good as it could be, but it's certainly not as bad as some people make it out. I think that criticism is often rooted in expectations prior to the game's release.@Jtheripper Well that's good to hear. While I'm sure the last-gen version is never going to be perfect, at least it's a lot better than it was and it's a free upgrade if you have a PS5.How dare you change your mind@bozz Okay that was an excellent response and I agree with everything you said.@Juanalf ""...although I do admit that does make me the complainer of complainers that complain about complainers.""I HATE those! Oh wait...@jrt87 How are they the contrarian as opposed to the individual still viewing this game through the lens of the 2020 release as opposed to the version reviewed here? Why not discuss this update rather than the initial state of the game? When is it okay to discuss the present?Been playing it since it launched on PS5, and definitely one of the best open world games ever, so much to do and everything no matter how small feels meaningful because most things come with some interesting story or something to read that gives you a peak into every scenario and what went wrong. This is a game that basically conquered ""open world fatigue"" because everything is worth doing. One flaw I'd say is the story seems too short already at the end game wall and there's still so much to do before attempting it@jrt87 all they did was create a technical marvel that wouldn't run on incredibly underpowered hardware, the only mistake they made was releasing it on PS4 and Xbox one but they'd get far more flack for cancelling them. Fact is if they were treated fairly for what they are, an indie studio they wouldn't be torn apart for the things they did wrong, plenty of smaller studio games with many problems but they're given a pass because they're not as popular@Subsided This minimalization and outright willful ignorance is just absurd.First of all, CDPR is NOT an INDIE studio by any means they have over 1000 employees and very morally questionable management, and this unfinished disaster of a game had a 316-million-dollar budget allocation.Second, they didn't just create a technical marvel that couldn't run on certain hardware. They literally lied to their customers and investors regarding the content and state of the game. They intentional withheld availability for the game to be previewed and reviewed in order to grab as many pre order and day one sales as possible before everyone realized the pushed out a game missing most of what they advertised it having with ridiculous marketing stunts all the way up to launch.They basically decided short term profit and fraud was more important than their customer base and reputation.I have to believe you are just trolling with such a misinformed post.@KundaliniRising333 that's your interpretation, only in your ignorance do you think your interpretation is the only acceptable way of seeing things. I won't argue with you, just merely suggest you get an education and expand your mind so it's not so incredibly narrow@JohnGrey Oh here we go with the dude who gets all hung over the number on the review rather than it's actual content. Comparing the numbers at the end of reviews rather than the content & context within them is surely more absurd than the PS review staff. The numbers are just there.... most reasonable patrons here recognize that some ""8's"" are better than others & likewise. All ""8's"" are not equal. So chill out & get a grip with how ridiculous you sound going on about ""unironically listening Captain Beefheart"" & whatever you're talking about.... all because a review of Cyberpunk 2077 was ""ONE NUMBER LOWER THAN HORIZON!!! HUUUAAHHHH!!!!""@GalacticBreakdownOh, here we go with the dude that comes to a review site that uses 40 point number ratings to cap off their reviews and shrieks that numbers don't matter. Jesus, you showed me with that 200 IQ move.Personally I think so far I’d probably give it a 6/10.It’s still very glitchy and unpolished. Also overheated both of my PS5s multiple times and also had a few game crashes.The story is pretty shallow and drags along like gum most of the time. The menu system is ridiculous.It’s a good game, but very far from a great game. I am happy with it though, looking at the state it got released in I didn’t believe in them taking it this far.Here’s hoping CDPR use this as the basis to actually make the great game the promised.I think that criticism is often rooted in expectations prior to the game's release.Imagine that you love golfing. You grew up with it, you and your friends played it, but in most places with a median income under $130,000 finding a way to play is next to impossible, so it's just a bougie pastime that means a great deal to you.Along comes a games company. We'll call it Cassette Project Blue. They say, ""you love golf?! We love it too! We've got some of the best golfers of all time as consultants and we're going to build the best golf game of all time. All of the complexity, nuance, skill, chance, even romance of the game will be right there for you to enjoy! It'll take eight years, but boy will it be worth it!'Eight years pass. The game comes out. The only things you can do in it are valet park cars, mix the same three drinks in the clubhouse while talking to the same 30 personalities with different meat sleeves, and drive balls on the same three ranges, and each shot that you take has a 20% chance of exploding, causing you to drop the terrain or spawn a 50-meter Arnold Palmer that misses you by centimeters but causes you to die from the fall damage of stumbling. In short, it's the biggest farce of a golf game possible.14 months pass. Cassette Project Blue releases their next generation update. Gone are the exploding golf balls, the gargantuan cocktails, and impromptu descents into the abyss. It's still a game where you mix drinks and mindlessly hit balls on driving ranges.If there were expectations that posters here would be raw about in this hypothetical scenario, they're expectations that those posters didn't make up out of whole cloth. That, evidently, would be the 95% of the workload at Cassette Project Blue. Hypothetically.Let's leave the arguments there. Some people like the game, some people don't. It's all good. Don't want to start removing comments when we're all perfectly capable of having a rational conversation.@JohnGrey Just leave pal, it ain't worth it.@ShogunRok Way ahead of you.I played it all the way through on ps4 pro after patches and didnt have any problems. and now playing it through on ps5 its still very much the same game 7/10 its very much a game designed in 2010 for better or worseI played through the five hour trial. I’m gonna buy it before it goes off sale.From what I’ve gathered so far… the game’s basic foundation is amazing.But I can tell just five hours in that it’s not the game changer CDPR sold us all those years ago. It feels like a fairly run of the mill first person western RPG.I think what helps it immensely though is the atmosphere of the game’s world, and the love and attention to detail that went into crafting it. Take that away and it’s merely average. But with it, it’s a genuinely good Western RPG.@JohnGrey off topic (a bit) but being a massive frank zappa fan and understanding his friendship with captain beefheart i bought trout mask replica and jesus christ whats that all about..i tried listening to it in various ""states"" in my youth but no..not getting it oh and lay off the golf dude..not cool..@ShogunRok This may seem like a weird question, but do you ever get to see the character you've created other than when you activate a mirror to change the appearance?I've only sampled the prologue and was quite impressed with the character creator, only to be somewhat disappointed to see that all cutscenes seemed to be first-person and reflective surfaces seemed unreflective until you activated them to look at your character. Struck me as a wasted opportunity.Entertained by the wide variety of opinions on this version of the game that originally had a wide variety of opinions back when it originally launched. As someone yet to play CP, I'm looking forward to finding out for myself which side of the fence I'll end up on.What I will say is that I firmly believe everyone has their right to come here and crap all over the game, as much as they have the right to come here and applaud it. Taking umbrage with someone else's opinion and elevating your objections to a point where you become borderline disrespectful or outright hostile is just plain childish.Read the opinion, absorb it, counter it if desired - but always respect it.Always amazed how salty and unforgiving the gaming community can be towards a company (who's product is a non-essential good) when messing up and then making up for their mistake. How do those people handle relationships, workplace etc...!?I was never going to touch this until the true PS5 version came out, this is why I waited! Having a blast with it now and Horizon. Great start to the year for PlayStation!Liked the demo enough to pick this up digitally for £20. Will get to it later in the year. H:FW, Elden Ring and others await now.@ShogunRok Great review which made some very welcome points I needed to hear, like the skill rebalancing and mission roll out changes.
I cant help feel you might have mentioned the two modes available. Ray traced shadows make very little difference I can see, so it seems pointless to include them at the cost of halving your frame rate to me, would have appreciated your take on that.
I think I owe to myself to check this game back out now its had its changes and patches, I'm more inclined to forgive what it isn't (despite false promises) and accept what it is instead.Now I've seen the PS5 version, I'll stick with my PC despite haptics, as ray traced reflections make the biggest graphical difference in this game and its disappointing that they have not implemented some RT reflections on PS5, maybe that was expecting too much? I'm lucky enough to have a 3090 on my PC so if I dive back in, I should stick with that.I'm very glad more people can now enjoy what the game does offer..I held off on playing it until the PS5 release. Got just a few hours into it, and I was enjoying it, but then HFW came out lol. I look forward to diving back in eventually.Nice, I'll get this game for sure since I heard the story is good 😃@FuriousMachine You do get to see your character in a handful of cutscenes, but they're very few and far between. Driving also has a third person camera, in case you didn't know.I do agree, though. You can make fantastic looking characters in this game and yet you basically never see them up close. At least you can go third-person in photo mode!@KeldorTheCursed I didn't start it yet because I knew that by the time I finish Forbidden West I would have forgotten the controls and any story I'd got through. Next in my queue!Removed - flaming/arguing; user is bannedI had no interest in this game whatsoever when it came out, and even less when I heard the reviews. I'm not a fan of FPS type games (I prefer 3rd person experiences) but when I saw it was £19.99 and getting better reviews I thought, to hell with it, let's see what it's all about! And I'm actually quite enjoying it I have to say. I wish there was a 3rd person mode, but I'm playing on easy and I'm holding my own so I'm happy enough. Not encountered any game breaking bugs either, although I've only just got to the Keanu bit so there may be some to come.@ShogunRok I'm finally enjoying the game on PS5 having owned it on PS4 but not touching it due to all the issues. My biggest takeaway however is that it feels dated in terms of certain gameplay mechanics - something it has in common with every Rockstar title in my opinion. No matter how good a story or the characters may be in these titles, 6/7 years in development ultimately leads to some aspects feeling dated by current gaming standards. Just an observation!@TJ81 No, I agree, there's definitely some jank there, and some mechanics do feel quite basic and, like you say, dated. But I think there's just enough variety in all the skills and potential playstyles to outweigh the negatives. A bit like Skyrim, I suppose.But yeah, you can definitely tell Cyberpunk was in dev for years, there are parts of it that feel bolted on, or stitched together, in a way.Games good, I mean you gamers must blow threw the tissues as much crying you soy boys do over these games.@Would_you_kindly Well, that is exactly what SHOULD happen. Some games change dramatically through bigger and smaller updates. Re-reviewing them should be the norm, not the exception. Of course, it's a different thing if that is practically feasible.currently £20 too on the store, might be worth sticking in the backlog for a later dateRemoved - flaming/arguingStill dunno what people expected when this game has always been the exact thing they showed us in the 2018 reveal trailer. I remember being underwhelmed back then.On a similar note, Elden Ring seems like more of the same, not sure what all the hype is about. I mean, I'm sure it will be a solid game, but it seems like so many people are expecting it to literally be the best game of all time.@ShogunRok People forget Witcher and Skyrim had UI overhauls later in it's life cycle. The foundation is clearly there with Cyberpunk. Now with it being more accessible in it's intended form, I'm excited for what CDPR has planned for it in the months/years to come.@stinkyx Except it's not at all what it was a couple years ago? Like, all the changes are spelled out for anyone to see. I don't think anyone is expecting this to be a masterpiece anymore the way it was marketed but a very good game though? Yeah, that's actually the current state of it. It really has come leaps and bounds.@charbtronic Same here, I think there's a really solid foundation for CDPR to build on now. A shame this wasn't the case at launch, but better late than never. I think the DLCs / expansions could be really good.@theheadofabroom I'm sure I'll be totally lost when I start back up 😆Removed - flaming/arguing; user is banned@Migoshuro games can also get worse with time a very good example of this for me is modern warfare 2019 when it originally released I would've given it an 8.5 / 9 however a few months later I'd rate it much lower""but it's easy to forget just how broken..""No! No, it isn't.But yeah, it plays much better now..You know, I took sometime to figure out what was my beef with Cyberpunk 2077, but I believe I just figured it out. It is the first person camera, more especifically, the field of vision of the first person camera. I took a motorcycle to test this theory by entering and exiting it to swap between third and first person camera, and I can confirm it. The level of immersion in the city with the third person camera just doesn't compare.I said it once and I will it say again: CDPR really should invest on implementing a way to allow us to play the game in third person view. AND this concept will be so game changing that the first expansion for the Cyberpunk 2077 can very well be all based on it.@vict0RGM I'm not 100% sold on third-person in Cyberpunk (although I wouldn't say no to having the option), but I will say that an FOV slider would be hugely welcome on console. The field of view seems so narrow at times — I'd love to be able to scale it back a bit.@Would_you_kindly I didn't say otherwise, did I? Your comment strengthens my point. But I'm frankly not sure if you wanted to counter it.Removed - unconstructive feedback; user is banned@ShogunRok Thanks for the answer  I've never really gotten into photo mode in games, but it speaks to their popularity when a dev puts so much work into a character creator and the results can almost exclusively be seen in said mode. Ah well, missed opportunity@Would_you_kindly I read it and enjoyed it. This almost feels like a soft relaunch like No Man Sky.@JohnGrey While I have disagreed with most of your arguments so far, that golf game analogy was just about the most hilarious thing I have read in a long time, and I think I you need to be acknowledged for it. Don’t let my chat handle fool you…I mean it. Bravo, sir.I only ""played"" the trial version. The world seems interesting. But I cannot say whether I like the game or not. So far I have the impression that I watched a movie rather than playing a game. Graphics wise it is a mixed bag for me, some areas look fantastic some areas look out-dated. Might just be the lighting during day time, or because of the low resolution I played in (big PSVR cinematic screen). In PSVR cinematic mode, the raytracing mode does not feel good when turning, so I played in performance mode. Sound seems very buggy. When starting the game there is absolutely no sound in PSVR cinematic mode. After loading a game multiple times or fiddling with some settings the sound eventually appears, but has some strange reverb and voices, music and effects do not seem to be well balanced. Anyway to play in this mode a further patch is needed.Concerning the camera, the game feels like it was designed for VR, albeit CDPR's negative statements concerning VR. Maybe they have not yet(?) managed to translate all gameplay elements correctly to VR?I bought and played on PC seeing the console ports where so bad but even then is was rough. At one point I was walking along and every ncp was the same fat guy in different cloths, 25 versions of the same model everywhere you looked. I finished the game but skipped all the side content after fat man road and was glad to see the back of it. I may play again one day but not until all DLC content is out and then only if it reviews really well.Thank you for the honest re-review! I plan on giving Cyberpunk a chance as soon as all of the DLC has been released and mostly patched.@ShogunRok - Hi, I would encourage re-reviews or should we say updates if an initial release has been slated due to Bugs, Glitches etc. - I often check reviews before purchasing games, but seeing a 2020 review detailing Bugs, Glitches, Crashes etc - I have no way of knowing whether this had been patched. - Or is there a site detailing patches that have been released for Game Titles ....?My PS4 install went from 107GB to 58GB after the newest patch...Is that normal?

Cyberpunk 2077,Sean  Cahill,Gaming Nexus,https://www.gamingnexus.com/Article/7233/Cyberpunk-2077/,"I have never played a game that is as good as it is infuriating as Cyberpunk 2077, and there’s plenty of both with CD Projekt RED’s latest release. Given the years of hype this game had, there’s little need for fluff in prepping. Let’s jump in.Night City is the name of our dystopian dreamland, a city full of life and death with outskirts that match the constant chaos surrounding the protagonist of the story, V. Upon starting up the title, you’re given three paths to choose from: Nomad, Street Kid and Corpo. While the main storyline quests are the same post-prelude, your origins will give your version of V extra dialogue options and bonuses. I opted for a Corpo in my run through Night City, starting me off in the Arasaka Corporation. Asked to take on a rather impossible job that never gets off the ground, V is removed from a position in the company and takes to street jobs with their friend, Jackie. It’s here where the player gets the first taste of Night City and what it brings to the table.Cyberpunk 2077 follows a tried-and-tested formula with the sandbox-style action games: The main storyline is always there as an option, but there are plenty of side quests to unlock and ways to build up your street cred. While all side jobs are optional, the benefits are numerous. Better jobs mean better money and the chance to get improved weaponry and cybernetics that give V an advantage in every fight.The backbone of Cyberpunk 2077 comes with having an RTX-capable graphics card. Anything above the RTX 2060 will do, but to truly see Night City in all its splendor, you’ll want to hit the 3000 series (if you can find them, of course) for the best visuals to come out through Ray Tracing, which affects detail, reflections, accuracy….just about anything you can think of. The most impressive thing to me is specifically with reflections. Minute details like lighting on vehicles, televisions, screens and glass are simply incredible. Advertisements in the game are sharper while things such as garbage and debris even have more detail. Cyberpunk 2077 is basically the advertisement for Nvidia’s latest technology in so many ways.My system, sporting a Core-i7 8700k and an RTX 3080, handled the game rather well. Yes, I saw the bugs that some people had reported on PC such as issues with rendering in the distance and NPCs occasionally looking like blocky messes for a few seconds. As patches have rolled in, these issues became less frequent. I had multiple crashes early on in the review process—six in total—but didn’t experience one in the last week of reviewing. I say this as someone who has played through the most frustrating and satisfying FPS and sandbox games out there: Cyberpunk’s system will not fail to both amaze and frustrate you. The good part of the gameplay is the mixture of mechanics to help or hurt you. The hacking element is a blast, though it’s a bit tough to pick up on at first. Shutting down cameras, disrupting an enemy’s visor or just causing a distraction via a drink machine are all possibilities that give V an upper hand in combat. Players can use this for either straight up combat or stealth purposes to get past a difficult section without using any bullets. Some missions will truly test your patience with ammo usage as it’s easy to blow through reserves before you’re out and have no backup other than wild charging or scavenging for extra magazines. In short, make your shots count.The frustration of the gameplay comes in two forms: Enemy strength and the map system. The map itself is fine, but it can be confusing to find specific areas or know what certain missions are. Some of it is meant to be vague, and that’s fine, but at some point as V is being contacted by every fixer in Night City it would make sense they know what they’re going to. That’s another issue I have: Fixers will call V the moment they enter a new area to tell them to hit them up for work. The strange part is that some of these side missions just randomly start without doing anything. Driving past a certain area, or just bombing down the highway, I got numerous alerts that a new job was starting and I had no idea what I did to trigger it. The backlog of messages on V’s phone grew rapidly, leading to me forgetting who was sending V what and where my original destination was supposed to be. If it were dialed back just a bit, I wouldn’t care as much about the constant bombardment.That leads me to enemy strength. No doubt, this system borrowed from a few other games. There’s nothing wrong with that, but I’m a big believer in that weapons and armor should matter. Seeing enemies who are wearing absolutely nothing in the way of armor, even down to their bare skin, eat numerous shots without any kind of slowdown wore on me in a hurry. Headshots stagger opponents but some of them have incredibly strong armor ratings, leading to frustrating battles of constantly trying to clip the head while their health bar barely dropped. This was on the standard difficulty, making me quite wary of even attempting the hardest level.Keanu Reeves both voices and provides the likeness of Johnny Silverhand. As expected, he is a central character in the game and is an absolute treat to be around. Reeves knocks this role out of the park, one of which I will not delve into further as there’s almost no way to do so without spoiling a big part of the main story that kept me hooked.Cyberpunk starts off pretty slow. After the prologue, the game slow-rolls things by providing a mission to help get used to the mechanics. There is an in-depth tutorial that I strongly recommend going through, possibly even more than once, especially for the hacking and stealth portions. While I enjoyed hacking and using it to my advantage, it was almost always for attacking. Stealth was a tad frustrating, though I did opt for the silent assassin role a couple of times midway through the game. The game weaves in and out of story and gameplay rather easily with well-timed climaxes and outstanding voice acting. No bugs in the game could deter me from wanting to continue the story and find out just how things came to an end.The beauty of Cyberpunk’s story is that the core of it does remain the same, but playing through it more than once in different roles provides different insight and attitude not just toward V, but vice versa. Those special background-related responses are worth using every single time to see the NPCs react to V, whether they are showing amazing knowledge or being a sarcastic jerk to try and deflect. The side missions, once you figure out how to search out the proper ones and adjust to the difficulty of them, add some meat to the already full plate of the story.Not anymore, no.My issues all came in the first two weeks of playing, with the worst happening a few hours into the game. The shortlist of my worst bugs encountered are as follows:The final few days of reviewing the game, however, yielded a pretty great experience. My frustrations with the difficulty are still there, but the story is so good that I learned to just adapt and deal with it. Getting the secret weapons that are available throughout the game also helped, but I still found myself burning through tons of ammo in order to keep up. Cybernetic upgrades will help immensely, but that requires doing the side missions to boost rep and earn extra stat points as the best ones are locked behind those types of achievements.I know the console version is an absolute mess and CDPR has taken it on the chin for that, and rightfully so. The PC version is far less of a mess and runs pretty great. You’re going to need a heck of a system, as I said before, to get the most out of it so keep your expectations in check and follow their recommended specs to a T. Otherwise, you may burn out your poor graphics card by pushing it too hard.Yes.For all of its faults, annoyances, bug problems and varying degrees of difficulty, I still enjoyed my time in Night City. Honestly, I’m not sure I’ll go back to it anytime soon. It’ll give CDPR time to further clean up the game and add to it, giving me a fresh experience when I’m ready to dive back in. I’d say avoid the console version at all costs until CDPR is ready to push it out again, but the PC version? It’s worth it.* The product in this article was sent to us by the developer/company.Sean is a 15 year veteran of gaming and technology writing with an unhealthy obsession for Final Fantasy, soccer, and chocolate.

Cyberpunk 2077,Paul Sullivan,COGconnected,https://cogconnected.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-review/,"*sigh* Well, here we are. Eight years after being revealed Cyberpunk 2077 has finally released. Incredibly, it needed more time. A lot more time. And a long, sobering look at its goals and plans to get there. Cyberpunk 2077 is a confused experience that tries to do something for everyone and ends up failing more often than not. There are good pieces here, no doubt, but it lacks coherence and kicks itself in the cyberware every time it glances longingly at greatness.Cyberpunk 2077 is also completely borked on consoles. This is, without doubt, the buggiest ‘finished’ game I’ve ever played. Yes, that includes Mass Effect Andromeda, and *shudder* Fallout 76. I cannot recommend paying money for this game on consoles right now. Most of this review will avoid discussing bugs except where necessary, but be aware that they have heavily impacted my experience and thus this review. Some of the more egregious include:
– Hard crashes to the Xbox dashboard
– Punching a window and being thrown several hundred meters back into the desert
– Overlapping, mismatched, and muted dialogue in main plot missions
– An enemy clipping through the floor, and then exploding like a grenade when grabbed
I could go on for ages (Seriously, ask anyone at COGconnected), but I’m not going to. I’d rather cover Cyberpunk 2077 itself, which tells the story of V.I mean, it kind of does. In theory, V is whoever you want them to be. The character creator has a good deal of depth in some areas but is oddly devoid of choice in others. There’s a choice of three origin stories – I chose the Nomad path – that each unlock specific dialogue options throughout the game. These are primarily for flavour, and it was pretty rare that a Nomad speech check pushed the narrative forward in a meaningful way. It made my connection to V feel thin, even after 40 or 50 hours of time with her.In fact, the only meaningful story beat related to V’s Nomad origin is the game’s tutorial mission. It was intriguing, teasing a lot of V’s history, and introducing us to Jackie: V’s soon-to-be partner in crime. The conclusion of that tutorial mission makes clear that Jackie and V are going to go into business together. We’re treated to a well-done montage of events where Jackie and V meet people, conduct heists, drink and dance, and generally grow their Night City reputation. The whole time I was thinking: why am I not playing these events? Maybe the parts that come after will be more impactful in building V’s character and her connection to Jackie?The answers are I don’t know, and not really. It’s a bizarre design choice that directly impacts the experience of Cyberpunk 2077’s first act. Dropping back into the world with Jackie and V is like being the third wheel on what’s clearly a date. They already know each other and have a strong bond, and as a player you’re scrambling to understand what makes the relationship tick. It’s a problem that pervades the game as a whole.V has a clear personality. Regardless of the choices you make to nudge her toward kindness or cruelty, V is always going to be V. As a player, you’re watching the events unfold while whispering suggestions into V’s ear. Situations may balloon out, but generally funnel back down to a singular outcome with some slight tweaks. You’re watching through V’s eyes, but you aren’t really her. The narrow range of outcomes makes you a passenger to the experience, not the one playing the lead role. It’s a fundamental issue that hounded me throughout the game. Cyberpunk 2077 has revolutionary role-playing game ambitions but delivers a story closer to Cyber Uncharted than to Deus Ex. Part of the disconnect has to do with the aforementioned time skip, but the vast majority is due to the construction of the world.At first, I was desperate to dig into the world. To see how deep the rabbit hole might go. But the closer you get, the more you realize that Night City is a mile wide, but mere inches deep. The Wizard of Oz is blasting smoke and fire, but it’s far too easy to peer behind the curtain. Most doors are permanently locked or impossible to open, while NPCs have nothing interesting to say. There’s a ton of space to explore, but the payoffs are too few. They’re too thin. I’d gladly trade most of the dozens of random, unsatisfying gigs for more time with the interesting core characters. I wanted to care about Jackie, and Judy, and Vik, but the game doesn’t put in enough effort building those bonds.Night City itself is vast and spectacular, a shining neon beacon of what humanity has become. It looks great, and packs some really excellent art design that backs up the game’s tone. Technology is the only thing keeping humanity going, and the design work here is top notch. When V first handles a new gun, it animates like a Transformer. Pieces shift and snap into place, making absolutely clear that this isn’t just a pistol, it’s a cyberpistol. It’s right in line with established properties like Blade Runner, but the aesthetic is consistent, and of really high quality. The seedy megabuildings scream Judge Dredd while billboards and TV ads show exactly how horny this world is.Spoiler: it’s super horny. Cyberpunk 2077 is obsessed with being edgy and trying to shock you. It never landed for me. It’s clearly a design choice that was made, but I’m not convinced they pushed things in a new enough direction. Ads have the grossness dial cranked to 11, and that’s fine, but they generally fail to bring any nuance to the party. It comes off as cheap and adolescent, and it pushed me further away from engaging with the world.The only thing really propelling me forward was the main story. Johnny Silverhand is a cool character, and while the way he and V link up isn’t exactly novel, it’s handled in such a way that I always wanted to see the next piece of the puzzle get placed. There are a few truly great moments peppered throughout, and it’s the little touches that really shone bright for me. As Johnny and V rub off on one another, small cues make that connection seem more believable. V’s increasing urge to light up a cigarette, for instance.Keanu Reeves’ delivery is laid back and cool, though some of the line reads sound like they could have used a couple more takes. Meanwhile, I wasn’t blown away by female V’s voice acting – the tone between lines was all over the place, but that could be related more to direction and writing than the actual acting.It always felt like the main missions were on the precipice of being something great. At one point, I had V steer a discussion down the path Johnny wanted, and he flashed a tiny thumbs up her way. It’s an insignificant detail, but the kind of thing you might see in a big budget, AAA RPG.But inevitably, repeatedly, it all came crashing down. Just as I’d find the joy of playing this game, it ripped the fun right out of my hands. Most cutscenes and open world interactions suffered from incredible pacing issues. Many times, characters would be talking over each other to the point I wasn’t sure who was responding to whom. In other cases, important, impactful conversations would be drowned out by overly loud ads or derailed by multiple incoming text messages about cars for sale. In other cases quest scripting would be outright broken, forcing a reload of a past save to interact with a quest object.And that’s during the main story threads. Things are far, far worse the minute you stray away from the critical path. For all the thought-provoking and enjoyable sections of the main quest, the quality of the side content is a giant step down in quality. Though some – such as the Delamain missions – are interesting and worth engaging with, the bulk come off as cheap, lazy, and poorly written. Huge tonal swings between line reads and poor dialogue flow actively pushed me away from the more investigative options. “This isn’t how people talk” isn’t something I ought to be thinking when playing a narrative-focused game. Obviously an open world has to have some activities totally divorced from the plot, but it’s where those two worlds cross that the gulf becomes most apparent.Panam, a character from a main plot mission or two, pops up in several other quests. In them, the character behaves and speaks in a vastly different way. The spicy, my way or the highway Panam I’d grown rather fond of was replaced by a slapdash, ghost written, drug store novel copy. Awkward phrasing had alarm bells ringing right away, but the moment she began a statement with “Perhaps I shall”, I knew there was little hope of finding diamonds amongst Cyberpunk’s sandy sea of content. It’s as though an entirely different group of writers was responsible for side content, and none of them had guidance on the tone and voice of Night City’s world and residents. Worse still is knowing there are some good ones in the mix, and you might have to plow through 4 or 5 cringe inducing quests to find a good one.Cyberpunk 2077 desperately needed a pair of outside eyes to do a slash and burn edit of this thing. It’s trying to do everything, all at once, but there’s no balance. It’s true for the narrative content, and equally true for its mechanical systems.The game follows the classic Deus Ex system of choice. For each goal that needs accomplishing, there are multiple paths. You could sneak around the side of the building and hack a terminal if you have the technical know-how, or rip the back door open if you’re tough enough, or just shoot your way in if you haven’t specced in one particular direction. It works fine, but it’s stuff we’ve seen time and time again, and seen done better in the most recent Deus Ex titles.At the mechanical core, Cyberpunk 2077 is a hardcore RPG. And taken alone, any one of the systems would be impressively robust. D&D-esque stat points pulled from a tabletop RPG fuel character growth, while a massive array of perks are available for building out V. Practically, I had a hard time finding much I wanted to chase. A 10% boost to stamina or passive health recovery are theoretically useful, but the rest of the game design actively works against those incentives.Take stealth for instance. Being sneaky is fun, and bamboozling your foes with a limitless arsenal of hacks and body mods should be incredible. But, for one, stealth is busted and enemies will often see or hear you through walls. Besides that, this is an archaic stealth implementation. Areas of influence are sharply defined, and Guard A noticing you always means his pals in the region also immediately know where you are. It’s logically flawed, but it’s also crucially lacking any incentive to go to the trouble.And that’s because simply shooting enemies is easier, faster, and has zero downside. I replayed many sections of Cyberpunk from a stealth perspective after taking the go loud path, and from what I can tell there’s no difference in outcome outside of – occasionally – a throwaway piece of dialogue. There’s no faction reputation to be won or lost, or different paths to unlock because you did things the hard way.It’s a giant structural flaw. For all the talk about the Voodoo Boys and all the other gangs, there’s zero way to affect how you interact with them. And thus, no good reason to take any path but that of least resistance, mowing down everyone in sight. At the end of the day, everything you do earns you Street Cred regardless of your methods. Imagine the Paragon/Renegade system from Mass Effect, but the meter only goes up, and everything you do makes it go up. I don’t understand the purpose it serves, except to artificially gate progress and force engagement with bad side activities.But it doesn’t actually force anything. Shooting is too effective. And thankfully, it feels serviceable. The default stick setup is atrocious, but after zeroing out all the acceleration and weird default dead zone settings, it’s comparable to how Fallout 4 feels. It’s good! Not Destiny 2 good, but a solid first effort. Smart guns and chargeable Tech weapons add much needed variety.Driving, on the other hand, is downright bad. Think Ridge Racer on ice, but with cars stopped everywhere you’re supposed to do a cool drift. And bags of garbage are immovable barriers. A character called Claire offered to enter me in some street races, and I laughed aloud. Drive more? By choice? Absolutely not. When possible, I preferred to run or fast travel to avoid driving.Speaking of quality of life, let’s discuss Cyberpunk’s UI. To say it’s cumbersome would be far too kind. It’s confusing, illogical, and slow, and you’ll be using it a lot. The main menu stretches both horizontally and vertically, and controller navigation is unpredictable, but my main gripe is how selling and breaking down items works. Singularly. With each sold item, the UI must refresh, which also changes the organization of the list, requiring you to double check you’re not about to sell something you want. Every. Time. No bulk selling, no marking items as junk, no auto-best function. The menu interface is lifted almost directly from The Witcher 3, and I know you remember that system, dear readers. No direct map access button, no quick way to check on your quests – need I go on and on here? Quality of life features are almost certainly a victim of what I have to assume is a forced timeline, but that doesn’t improve the user experience.The experience of playing Cyberpunk 2077 on the Xbox Series X is – graphically – ok. The quality mode provides decent visual quality at a reasonably steady 30 fps, while the performance mode offers a muddy presentation at 50-60 fps. Textures stream in well enough, but overall quality and performance are what I’d expect to see on a PS4 Pro or Xbox One X. And well, the game runs unacceptably poorly on the last gen platforms. I do think the assets and art work are very strong overall, but it’s difficult to appreciate when someone is often T posing or sliding up and down the stairs.So now, 2500 words in, let’s talk about what this game is actually like. Ultimately, this isn’t the Cyber Witcher. Head for the hills if that’s what you’re expecting. The writing isn’t of that same caliber, and the kinds of interesting side experiences you’d find there are largely absent in Cyberpunk 2077. The closest games in terms of loop and structure are Fallout 4 and Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, but with a few caveats. Cyberpunk’s scope is a lot wider, but the density of interesting things is infinitely smaller. Things you can interact with are few and far between, with incredibly few named or interesting NPCs.For Cyberpunk 2077 to be an outstanding game, one of two things needed to happen. Descoping of large portions of the game, and a structure more akin to an action RPG. A tighter focus akin to Rise of the Tomb Raider or even Prey could have allowed for more depth to the narrative experience. OR, alternatively, they could have leaned way further into the RPG elements of the game. Spend more time balancing and incentivizing the various half baked systems like Netrunning, and offer far more flexibility in how V can be role played. Of course, such a move would come at the expense of the high production value narrative CD Projekt Red wanted to create. As it turns out, even 8 years of development couldn’t make both – or either – of those outcomes happen. So is this a good game? Yes, sometimes, but only if they manage to sufficiently patch it.*Xbox review code provided by the publisher*Developer: CD PROJEKT REDPublisher: CD PROJEKT RED"
Cyberpunk 2077,Joe Apsey,PlayStation Universe,https://www.psu.com/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-review-ps4/," Joe Apsey / December 17, 2020Cyberpunk 2077 PS4 Review – Cyberpunk 2077 is a mighty game to review. Not just in terms of size, but the game has a lot of things going on, whether it be the litany of quests with compelling characters, the captivating and all-too-possible dystopian urban sprawl of Night City, or the endless issues with the game and the fact that it runs wildly differently on current generation and last generation systems.CD Projekt Red has crafted one of the best sci-fi dystopias in any video game ever, with fascinating stories which unfold within it and characters to grow to love and to learn to hate. But, despite the amazing work done here, the issues and crashing severely damage the experience, making Cyberpunk a pain to play at times and virtually unplayable on a regular PS4.Much like how in Grand Theft Auto the city and surrounding areas are the true stars of the show, Night City in Cyberpunk 2077 is a character in its own right. The metropolis with markets and multitudes of people packed tighter than an overpacked British train is a sight to behold and its grand scale, both in size and height, is accented by neon lights, graffiti splattered across streets, and a vivid destitute look that helps evoke the once-great promise this city held.But the city is more than just its looks, no matter how diverse and unique each of the game’s regions feels. Night City is filled with horrifyingly possible events and happenings that seem perfectly plausible in our future, and even some which don’t. A few examples of this include robotic partners called “Dolls” who you hire and share a booth with. They morph into the personality that best suits what you are attracted to and then will revert back to their typical form after your session has ended, truly taking the human connection out of sexual intercourse.The city is also packed with Ripperdocs, who modify people’s bodies, limbs, and cyberware for a price. In one story mission, you meet a black-market Ripperdoc of sorts who fixes and replaces parts for those who are poor or living in dangerous situations in Night City.And, as you stand there, listening to him rambling and fixing parts of people laid out on operating tables, he talks about how he uses cheap parts to fix these people and that comes with a host of side effects that might affect them or permanently damage them later on.Those are just a few of the horrific scenarios presented to you in Cyberpunk, but whilst these situations don’t seem bad or harmful to anyone involved, you quickly realise as you discover Night City that what these people experience is the pinnacle of poverty in the future. It projects an idea of what our current society, which is filled with inequality, could look like in 60 years. People selling parts of their bodies to survive or losing the meaning of human connection and talking and having sex with holograms or vapid robots and shells.Cyberpunk 2077 is bleak, terrifying and incredibly possible in real-life, which is a credit to the amazing work CD Projekt Red have done to bring the tabletop RPG to life onscreen.As for the core narrative of Cyberpunk 2077, you play as V, who can have one of three lifepaths. As a Nomad, you live outside of Night City and forge your own path in life. With a Corpo background, you grew up in the hustle and bustle of city life, with all the affluence and riches that come with the corporation-life. Finally, as a Street Kid, you grew up in the slums of Night City, experiencing the opposite end of life from those in the skyscrapers above.These lifepaths mostly affect your introduction to Night City and the early hours of the game. before they all converge into the main story path. That story path takes you on V’s journey as a run-and-gun Merc for hire, completing jobs for fixers in the city and living from job to job.But, it doesn’t take long for V to take up a job that gets him or her in far deeper than they have ever gotten before, embedded within a controversy involving one of the largest families and corporations in Night City and in possession of a fabled data chip, which is treated as a relic and is highly valuable.After the situation goes topsy turvy, V puts the relic chip into their body, allowing its code and data to seep into their system. What is on that chip turns out to be a living construct of Johnny Silverhand, a long-deceased rock band member and terrorist, who is looking for revenge and to complete his mission, using V as his vessel to do just that.I don’t want to go too much into the story but the core of it contracts into a tale about technology, what happens when we don’t have control over it and how far we would go to get the feeling of feeling like our true selves and what that exactly means.I liked where the story ended up and there are some fascinating characters you meet along the way, which are easy to fall in love with and show the true emotion and humanity behind the technological and corporate city they all live in.Particularly Paman, Judy, and Takemura who each hold a questline in the middle chunk of the game have great character moments and a chance to learn about their lives and who they are and were as people. There is some truly excellent stuff here involving these characters.As for Johnny Silverhand, he initially starts off quite grating but CD Projekt Red do a solid job of humanising him, although he is a terrorist so that element of wackiness is always there. Keanu Reeves does a stellar job of playing him and really helps bring the character to live thanks to Keanu’s great motion-capture performance and his ability to truly embody the character.One example of this comes quite late into the game, where you are chatting on a rooftop with Takemura and when you finish your conversation, hologram Johnny who talks and interacts with you as a literal voice in your head, rolls off the balcony and out of sight instead of disappearing like he usually does. It’s a great personality showcase and there are a lot of little moments like this, expertly performed by Keanu.When it comes to the side activities and exploring Night City in your car, it is a joy to ride around. Each district feels unique from the packed market streets of Westbrook to the towering skyscrapers of the City Centre, to the desolate but breath-of-fresh-air Badlands, that make you feel like you have escaped a claustrophobic, constrained cage as you explore them.There is a lot of variety in the visual aesthetics of the districts in Night City and within each one you have your own factions, some that have multiple, who compete for territory and each have their own unique playstyles and combatants.When it comes to activities in Night City, there are a collection of Side Jobs to complete, which are focused around a character, whilst Gigs are simple activities like stealing a certain item, killing an individual, or extracting a target. Crimes litter the streets for you to help the police fight against and there are other small activities like races and the ability to find and buy new vehicles.Each of these big Side Jobs has the same amount of engagement and enjoyment as was in The Witcher 3, with each one feeling meaningful and being fun to complete. This is added to with great voice acting and performances from the full cast, who really help sell the believability of this world.A lot of the smaller activities fill the “Open-world filler” void, but with how enjoyable the game is and how fun Night City is to explore, it stays engaging, especially as you can jam out to the excellent original soundtrack for this game, which is filled with tracks from a multitude of genres.As an RPG, Cyberpunk 2077 works in a lot of ways. It truly allows you to become the person you want to be by offering a wealth of attributes to specialise in and countless abilities to unlock, which can help attune your hacking skills, improve your stealth, or make you the perfect long-range fighter.Within each of the game’s five attributes, Body, Intelligence, Technical, Reflexes, and Cool, you can then use points you earn as you level up to buy the skills related to each attribute, which can be what I mentioned above, among a number of other things.There is a lot of flexibility and you can become fully proficient in one or two of these attributes or go for a more general build and spread your points out among all five categories.Beyond that, there are a host of weapons you can buy or find out in the field, each with their own rarity and host of perks, small bonuses, and buffs tied to them. The same goes for armor, which is less diverse and varied but can still be swapped in and out on the fly as you get new pieces.There is also a host of cyberware upgrades you can equip to your body, which can provide new quickhacks to distract enemies or deal damage in battle or provide entirely new abilities such as giant scissor arms which you can pull out and attack enemies with, or a grenade which you can shoot off.As for the actual combat and stealth mechanics here, Cyberpunk 2077’s gunplay feels great. Guns are punchy and feel futuristic to shoot due to the recoil and amount of feedback offered. Gunfights are chaotic, but a blast to engage in and I think the gunplay, the accuracy of it, and the fine-tuning CD Projekt Red have done make it better than the melee combat ever was in The Witcher 3.Melee combat in Cyberpunk 2077 is less great and can best be compared to a slightly more fine-tuned Fallout. It has the same floatiness and inaccuracy of that game, but it feels a little bit more responsive. It is possible to do a melee only run, but you will be missing out on the much-better gunplay.But, the problem with all this gear and variety is that none of it really feels meaningful here. Much like The Witcher 3, even Legendary and Power items, don’t have much spice or flavor and tend to just feel more powerful versions of the archetypes you already have in your inventory.On top of that, the stats screen and the info displayed on these weapons is quite confusing and there is no rhyme or rhythm to how they are dished out, with my inventory often being filled with higher quality weapons, that did less damage.Overall, it just feels a bit jumbled and cobbled together to create the illusion of choice, when really the choice lies in what build and attributes you select, rather than the weapons your wield.Now, let’s get onto the final section of this review and arguably the most important. Cyberpunk 2077 has A LOT of issues, no matter what system you are playing on. Some of the smaller issues include visual glitches and clipping with phones, packets of cards and other items floating in mid-air.On top of that, there were multiple scenes, including key story sequences which featured items clipping, including a gun pressed against a man’s head clipping into their head, ruining the immersion just a bit.Also, the A.I. for driving is just baffling, with pedestrians not driving around crashes or the parked car that you summoned. Instead, they just sit in place and cause a massive traffic blockade, which can hold up vehicle deliveries or the arrival of certain story points.Cyberpunk 2077 also suffers from a horrific crashing problem, with a crash expected every 45-60 minutes and lasting any longer without one is a miracle. These crashes force you to load back into the game from scratch, which is annoying on PS5, but downright a turn-off on PS4, where loading times are significantly extended.This crashing also happens completely randomly, which adds to the annoyance. Driving into a garage, the possibility of a crash. In the middle of a gunfight, possibility of a crash. Even, during pivotal story moments crashes can happen, which force you to restart a large section of the mission.On PS5, the game works great apart from these crashes. The visuals on Sony’s newest console aren’t anything spectacular, but colors pop and buildings have vivid highlights and designs. The game also runs at a mostly smooth 60 FPS, with some small drops here and there, but nothing major.Now, let’s talk about PS4. As mentioned in my early impressions, the game’s performance on PS4 is dreadful. It has since been confirmed that the game runs at below 1080p and framerate can drop to the mid-teens during certain sequences.On top of those issues, there a host of other problems which have been noted such as game freezes for up to a minute, more extreme bugs than what is found on PS4, and blurry visuals, bad draw distance, and a host of other visual issues.I played a good five or so hours of Cyberpunk 2077 on my 2013 launch PS4 and I didn’t enjoy a single part of the experience. It is a disaster, to say the least. And, if you don’t own a PS5 I can’t recommend you play this game. Wait until it is either patched (although I don’t know if the last-generation versions of the game can be saved from the poor technical state they are in right now) or you get a PS5.Cyberpunk 2077 is such a vastly different experience on PS5 and PS4 that it makes coming to a final conclusion tough. On PS5 the game is doing a great job of holding up and exploring Night City, meeting new characters, and discovering the dystopian dread of the citizens is fascinating and enthralling.But, on PS4, the game is horrific, virtually unplayable and just an absolute mess. I can’t recommend you play on PS4 right now and I don’t recommend ever experiencing Cyberpunk 2077 on PS4. I mean, even the backwards compatibility version on PS5 has its fair share of issues.But, if you are playing on a PS5, Night City is one of the best sci-fi dystopias ever depicted in games, with a haunting realistic take on technology, the power those who control it have, and the lengths humans will go to feel comfortable with themselves. Cyberpunk 2077 is a world worth exploring, just not on PS4.Cyberpunk 2077 is available now on PS4.Review copy provided by publisher.Cyberpunk 2077's Night City is one of the best sci-fi dystopias ever showcased in games. The stories it has to tell and the characters there are to meet are engrossing and terrifying. Despite some performance issues on PS5 backwards compatibility, it is still worth playing for the excellent character and narrative work. But, if you own a PS4, do not buy Cyberpunk 2077 as it is a technical mess that barely functions.

Cyberpunk 2077,Jason Rodriguez,PC Invasion,https://www.pcinvasion.com/cyberpunk-2077-review-pc/,"Let’s face it. A lot of people, myself included, were hoping Cyberpunk 2077 would be this glorious, majestic, and absolutely perfect video game. It isn’t. There are several problems I’ll outline below, though, for the most part, it’s still a great game in its own right.Oh, and before we get started, it should be noted that this review’s coming in a bit late. Our editor-in-chief, Cameron Woolsey, explained that it took us a while to receive a review code. I was only able to play on launch day. Subsequently, my roughly 50-hour playthrough is based on my experiences with the 1.02 and 1.04 versions of the game. After Cyberpunk 2077‘s character creation process, your main character V starts their journey depending on your chosen lifepath. This origin story introduces you to Night City, a den of crime and corruption in a dystopian future where a megacorporation rules all aspects of life.Fairly early on, you’ll meet a strong supporting cast of characters, many of whom present memorable missions and quests. There’s a lot of humor and depth to the personalities of these characters, too, from Jackie’s loyalty and banter, Panam’s leadership attributes, Kerry’s attempts to become independent, Judy’s techno wizardry, and Takemura’s code of honor. Likewise, there are romance options for you to consider.Of course, the crux of it all is rock star-turned-terrorist Johnny Silverhand (played by Keanu “Mr. Breathtaking” Reeves). His quest to topple the Arasaka Corporation doesn’t go as planned. Now, his and V’s fates are intertwined.From here, you’re given more jobs and gigs that’ll help you understand the story further. Oftentimes, you’d be interacting with Silverhand, whose extremely gruff, violent, and grim personality makes your relationship with him even more complicated. But make no mistake, one of Cyberpunk 2077′s core strengths is how its narrative and character dialogues are written.As you progress further in Cyberpunk 2077‘s campaign, you’re given the tools of the trade. You’ve got loads of armaments from smart weapons that track targets, and tech weapons that can punch through walls. There are also blunt and bladed weaponry (katanas, hell yeah), and Cyberware attachments that grant you new attacks. At one point, you even get to use a hovertank.Overall, Cyberpunk 2077‘s combat is very satisfying. Blows, blasts, and booms are impactful and loud, with effects that are sure to wow you.The game also has a clear-cut attributes and perks system, with multiple skills, to boot. Think of it as akin to Skyrim‘s proficiency system — keep using the same kinds of guns, attacks, or skills, and you’ll increase level of that particular perk.A notable attribute, Intelligence, governs the Breach Protocol and Quickhacking perks. These allow you to hack network systems to use cameras, cause distractions, lower enemy defenses, poison mobs, or fry their ocular implants to cause blindness. Let’s not forget that there are also braindance sequences and instances where V gets to play detective. These are all excellent mechanics that truly shine when combined with regular first-person shooter gunplay.Obviously, a game with these ideas in mind wouldn’t fare well if it looked or performed terribly. Now, as far as I’m aware, many players have been experiencing issues (especially those who got the game for the PS4 and Xbox One). In my case, however, I had decided to upgrade my rig prior to playing Cyberpunk 2077.As mentioned in our technical review, my rig has an Nvidia RTX 3080 GPU, Intel i9-10900K CPU, and 32 GB RAM. It’s definitely for high-end gaming; I rarely experienced framerate drops or stuttering in regular play. Indeed, a slowdown only occurred if I had a ton of items in my inventory and I was swapping between them, or if I’m alt-tabbed and had multiple pages opened while writing guides.Outside of these instances, the game ran smoothly. I was averaging 50-60 fps at 4K resolution with the “ray tracing: ultra” preset enabled. Likewise, there are additional tweaks that you can do to improve framerates, performance, and sharpening. Moreover, the DLSS option for RTX cards helps boost performance significantly. Granted, not all specs are the same, and results will vary greatly. It may be prudent for some to wait for more optimization updates before diving in.Regardless, my Cyberpunk 2077 experience, at least from a visual and graphical standpoint, has been simply breathtaking. Night City is rendered in a dazzling display of neon lights, character textures are very detailed, and ray tracing effects can be jaw-dropping at times. It helps that it’s got one of the best photo mode features I’ve ever used. Even if there were some limitations, I spent an unhealthy amount of time trying to get image captures.If Night City looks visually appealing then the sandbox can be disappointing. Yes, Cyberpunk 2077 does have various encounters with gangs and criminal elements. Yes, you can happily explore to your heart’s content. The problem, however, is that the AI is quite poor.It’s understandable when in combat since V has multiple skills to wreak havoc, but the exploration suffers when you realize that random NPCs don’t really do much. Heck, if you leave a car parked in the middle of a street, not a single driver attempts to swerve since it seems NPCs follow predetermined driving routes. Speaking of driving, Cyberpunk 2077‘s driving controls took a while to get used to. One word to describe it would be “janky.”The above qualms also coincide with Night City’s police force. When playing open-world action games, you’d become familiar with how the police react to crimes. Examples include the Grand Theft Auto, Watch Dogs, Saints Row, and Mafia franchises. Even the recent Assassin’s Creed Valhalla had soldiers and zealots chasing you while on horseback.In Cyberpunk 2077, breaking the law would have cops spawning out of thin air (often behind you). Running away gets rid of them easily because, like driving routes, police only have predetermined spots and street corners. It’s certainly a downer if you expected over-the-top car chases, wanton mayhem, and dynamic open-world action.Speaking of expectations, there were a couple of concepts that became huge letdowns. Remember the ‘2077 in Style‘ trailer? That got you thinking that V would go on an adventure “in style.” Sadly, Cyberpunk 2077‘s character customization options remain limited.For starters, you can’t change your appearance after character creation. V’s stuck with the same look and hairstyle for the rest of the game. It astounds me when you consider that the game takes place in a dystopian future where everyone has cybernetic implants, and yet further alterations or body modifications can’t be done. At most, you’ve got the aforementioned Cyberware implants for your arms, but those are only seen in first-person view.As for the clothing and attire options, you’ve got two choices: find stylish items while disregarding their stats, or wear decent items and look like a goof. I just went with the former, favoring fashion and style over utility and survivability. I figured that if I’m going to use photo mode to capture memorable moments often, V can’t look like a designer’s worst nightmare. It’s genuinely perplexing that the game lacks a transmogrification feature. I mean, you have the guy who made sci-fi look cool and hip thanks to The Matrix. But random characters walking around have better outfits than you do.It goes without saying that Cyberpunk 2077 has a number of flaws. Apart from those already mentioned, there were some minor hiccups that happened seldomly such as texture clipping and wonky animations. Also, looking at all those arcade cabinets and the fact that this is based on a tabletop RPG, it’s a missed opportunity not to have an engaging minigame — Gwent 2077, anyone?Evidently, Cyberpunk 2077 was so overhyped (and delayed multiple times) that it couldn’t live up to the expectations and clamor. If I approached this offering as an open-world action game akin to Grand Theft Auto or others in the genre, I would be severely disappointed. Instead, I focused primarily on the main missions and sidequests, and not on the sandbox itself. Furthermore, with Night City’s glitz and appeal, I was more concerned with taking in the sights and sounds, as well as photo mode captures. Increasing my wanted level and causing as much destruction as possible to fight the law (a common way of passing the time in the genre) took a backseat.I feel that this approach allowed me to appreciate the game even more owing to an unforgettable cast of characters, fun missions, and brilliant writing. Yes, in spite of some misgivings, I still managed to enjoy my journey in Night City.Cyberpunk 2077 has some glaring flaws and missed opportunities. Its open-world sandbox suffers from poor NPC and police AI, and it lacks customization and transmogrification features to help your character stand out. Still, the pros outweigh the cons owing to a brilliant narrative, memorable missions, strong supporting cast of characters, well-integrated combat and hacking mechanics, and jaw-dropping visuals.About Us

Blade Runner: The Video Game is our Game of the Decade before it's even started. In what is likely the most anticipated video game of the last decade, Cyberpunk 2077 has had a turbulent development period. With numerous delays pushing the release date back by more than seven months, developers of the immensely popular Witcher games, CD Projekt Red, inadvertently ramped up the hype to 11 by forcing gamers to wait for their take on a sci-fi RPG, but it's finally been locked and loaded for release on December 10.  Digital Spy has spent the last week playing the game on PC, sinking about 22 hours in to the murky, neon-lit streets of Night City and, having emerged, bleary-eyed from the other side of a whirlwind story that we have only half-complete, all we can think of doing is plunging head-first right back into the blood-soaked world of cybernetic chaos.Related: The best Xbox Series X and Series S pre-orders - Prepare for a second wave of Xbox pre-ordersWe'll be up-front here and say we are absolute suckers for dystopian, futuristic worlds bursting with danger and death – Blade Runner 2049 *is* one of the best films of the last few years, don't @ us – so we easily fell in love with this game. If you also love AI robots with sarcastic one-liners, dingy bars booming with '80s synthwave bangers, and futuristic weapons ready to disintegrate enemies, we think you'll love it too.  Check out our full thoughts on Cyberpunk 2077 below.A few weeks ago, gamers were sent into a frenzy when it was revealed a developer had been playing Cyberpunk 2077 for more than 170 hours and still wasn't finished with their play-through. We scoffed at this at first, but we now fully understand why they spent so long in this world. Cyberpunk 2077 is an immensely well-built, massive game, with a twisting narrative, deep lore and a gorgeous open-world that drags you into this dystopian future full of dangerous gangs, villainous corpos and freedom fighters. To start with, you'll be building your character from the ground up. This took us around 35 minutes because we MUST make the protagonist, V, look exactly like us. There's an obscene level of customisation, from the usual hair and eye colour to tattoos and body-scars, to cybernetic modifications to your body. And yes, you can choose the size and shape of your penis or vagina should you want to go to extreme detail to make your character *ahem* suit your needs. It doesn't affect the game that much, as you'll spend almost all your time in first-person, but we all love a good cosplay.Once that's done you'll build your back-story from three choices: Nomad, Street Kid or Corpo. This is an important decision to make as it will influence where you start in the game (as well as roughly the first hour of storyline), how you interact with certain characters, and will determine what's available to you as you navigate the world. We liked to think that Nomads are for Mad Max fans (you start out in the Badlands with a gang of dust-covered ravagers), Street Kids are for Matrix fans (you're a man of the people and well-connected with the underground mobs), and Corpos are for Blade Runner fans (you have the advantages of wealth and status in the corporate world, and the approval of boardroom bad guys).For our review, we went full Matrix and chose Street Kid, which has your character, V, as a hardened mercenary well-used to the squalid underground life of Night City. He is well-connected with gang leaders and Fixers – Cyberpunk 2077's quest-givers – and comes with an upgrade to Street Cred, which lets you talk to more influential fixers early on and gives you access to better vendors within the city limits.Sometimes during dialogue you'll be given an extra choice that might give you more info, or change the relationship you had with a character depending on your origin, but we largely found it mostly affected the opening to the game.You'll ultimately build up your reputation as a reliable mercenary in a corrupted Night City with your best bud Jackie Welles, earning you a spot on a high-end heist to really kick the story off, which sees you stealing a bit of tech believed to be the key to immortality.A Japanese mega-corporation thinks they have found everlasting life in a city where death comes cheap and often, and you must steal this gadget for a rather shifty Fixer named Dexter Deshawn. The mission is a success, but at what cost? We won't spoil what happens, but you'll be eventually introduced to The Samurai himself, Johnny Silverhand, or our beloved Keanu Reeves in all his glory. Part rock and roll legend, part eco-warrior and terrorist, Johnny's fate will be intertwined with yours and you'll begin to wonder if fame and fortune in 2077 is all that worth it. We weren't quite expecting the dynamic between V and Johnny to play out the way it does, but you'll be seeing a great deal of this charismatic rock god throughout the game for good or ill. Suffice to say whenever he is involved, it's spectacular.We have played around 22 hours so far and we reckon we are around 30% of the way through. With hundreds of side-missions complete and a good chunk of the main story played through, we know there's still plenty to explore, and can easily imagine us sticking around in Night City for around 80 hours in our first complete play-through.The story isn't yet finished for us, and it's still holding some mind-bending plot twists and turns that are keeping us hooked, particularly as we explore our relationship with Johnny Silverhand, but we have been dragging our heels progressing through side missions, and we feel the main story might not be as long as you'd expect.The side-quests are an absolute hoot, with some serious detective work seeing you investigate murders by rogue agents, or an AI taxi service asking you to reign in his rogue self-driving vehicles (play this side mission through for a wicked Portal reference).You'll be using your phone to interact with Fixers and generate side quests, though there are random world events that can trigger missions or introduce new characters.We had a problem with a few missions that force you to bear witness to pretty horrific things, or take part in acts that we weren't quite comfortable with. There are ways to dodge these arcs or play them out in a ""heroic way"" but the narrative often leaves it to the very last minute to move away from these wretched missions, which sometimes rubbed us up the wrong way. We know it's an 18+ game and it's supposed to be a hyper-violent exploration of the degenerate future where online culture is immune to shock, but once you play a few missions for yourselves, we think you'll understand - particularly if you complete the entirety of the Sinnaman side quest. We'll be honest here and say that the fighting mechanics are not great. Gamers have been spoiled by top-end shooters like Call of Duty or TitanFall, and we are sad to say Cyberpunk comes nowhere close to that when it comes to pressing the trigger. It feels quite similar to games like Fallout, where you have a wealth of weaponry to choose from – guns are broken down into Power (hard-hitting guns with ricocheting bullets), Smart (auto-lock-on, heat-seeking bullets), or Tech (wall-penetrating energy bullets) – or you can get up-close and personal with katanas, knives or two-handed hammers. Shooting enemies will have them burst in a plume of blood and damage numbers, with a health bar above each enemy so you know how much damage you've done. Headshots do critical damage, and you'll be forced to think of new ways to approach fights as the difficulty ramps up. We wouldn't say there are enemy archetypes, but you will face a variety of cybernetically enhanced bad-guys that require a different tactic, from weak goons with a low IQ, to mecha-clad, rocket-launcher-wielding super soldiers.You'll also be able to disrupt enemies with QuickHacks, which put various debuffs on the enemies to help you win a gunfight. For example, you can hack their literal eyeballs to disorientate them for a quick getaway, or plant a Daemon virus in their brain to cause them to kill themselves right there on the spot. We spent a long time sneaking through missions, silently taking down enemies and only really opening fire when we got caught. Each weapon feels fun and unique to use – with upgrades or modifications to add explosive damage or poison effects – and it's fun to blast a man's head off with a shotgun, but we fear this part of the game won't blow you away.We also feel we didn't use quickhacks enough, as it was a little fiddly to be holding left bumper to analyse a cyber-ninja bearing down on your with a katana and figuring out what you should hit him with, as the menus and quickhack display is a little hard to read. It can be situationally useful, but most of the time it's faster and easier to just hammer away at the trigger until things are dead. However, this game is more than just its gunplay, and there's plenty of fun to be had elsewhere. You have a skill tree to get new abilities, much like the Witcher series, which improves weapon damage or increases hack speed and power. These are split into:Upgrading the branches will let you cut corners in the game. For instance, a higher Body rating will let you rip open doors for shortcuts, or a higher Cool level will open up new dialogue options that might help you talk out of a sticky situation.You can also spend level-up points to get new abilities, building V into the hero or villain you want him to be.And for the true Cyberpunk experience, you should head to a RipperDoc, who can enhance your body with techno-gadgetry to help you out in Night City. Each body part can get various upgrades, from titanium knees to increase your weight load, to iron lungs that improve stamina.  There's loads of fun to be had experimenting with this, as you can tailor the upgrades to suit your play-style in ways that might not be immediately obvious. Your arms can have scythes implanted in them for ripping enemies to bloody shreds, or you can upgrade them with actual Gorilla Muscles for brute-force in your right-hook punches. Your brain can be enhanced with faster processing to recognise hacking opportunities, or you can even get leg extensions to give you a double-jump.These are all small improvements to your character but really add to the overall mood and world-building of heading to a morally questionable doctor in the depths of the city in search or robot hands and deadly hacks in back-alley surgeries. When we found out that Cyberpunk 2077 was going to be delayed from its original July release date to September, then to November, and then again back to December, we were concerned it would never come out.However, now that we have played the game, we can see the benefits of the development team at CD Projekt Red taking more time to polish it off, even if we despise the crunch-culture it encourages. The game is drop-dead gorgeous, and is easily one of the best-looking games of the next generation. We reviewed our copy on a PC (an ASUS Zephyrus ROG G14 gaming laptop to be precise), which could handle the 4K Ultra settings with full ray-tracing. If you watched Blade Runner 2049 and adored the dark alleyways filled with unsettling strip-clubs and seedy bars dappled with neon lights and holograms, you will instantly fall in love with how good this game can look. Night City is almost perpetually afflicted with rain, so you'll always find a puddle to admire the glistening reflections of shop windows or car headlights. One bar we frequented for missions – The AfterLife – has a huge green neon sign above the bar that floods the room with light. With Ultra settings on, this light flickers and glances from table surfaces and beer glasses in real-time, giving the room a real depth and sense of realism. Even with ray-tracing turned off this game looks incredible, but we recommend you seeing the lighting effects if you have a next-gen console or PC. The improved lighting of next-gen graphics also makes the cybernetics look totally rad. Early on, you'll meet some gang members who, horrifically, have had their face literally replaced with spider-like flashing lights instead of eyes. They flash red with anger, which ignites the darkened room you sit in and illuminates their slashed faces in such a haunting, realistic way. And whenever you get a chance to look out over your balcony of your apartment or drink in the sweeping vista from the top of the many skyscrapers, you'll see the improved draw-distances as the city sparkles back at you through a hazy fog, full of life.We think the next-gen consoles like the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X will really show off the scale and quality of Night City in ways gamers might not be expecting. We have played Assassin's Creed Valhalla, Watch Dogs and Spider-Man Miles Morales on the next-gen consoles, but none of them looked as good as Cyberpunk 2077 did. It will still look great on current-gen consoles, but if you're lucky enough to get hold of a new gaming machine, you'll experience the full force of a next-gen triple-A title. We don't yet know if 4K 60FPS will be available for the next-gen version just yet, but we'd imagine that will be a standard in the months to come. CD Projekt Red is now well known for creating these huge, sprawling games set in captivating worlds, and their list of top-end titles grows ever-longer with Cyberpunk 2077.The Witcher 3 might have scratched that Swords-and-Shields itch as you guide Geralt of Rivia through the political machinations of Vizima and Skellige, but this is a whole new experience that feels more visceral,  dangerous, and alive than anything else you might have played before.We found it hard to figure out how to describe Cyberpunk 2077 using other games as reference, as it does take inspiration from elsewhere in small doses. Driving around Night City feels like a slightly tighter version of GTA, while the combat and RPG mechanics feels like Fallout or Skyrim. However, the story and the world feels completely brand new and original and, much like V's techno-morphed body, the mix of inspirations takes on its own identity to become a wild Frankenstein's monster of combined great games.Cyberpunk 2077 is a fantastic game that we have never experienced before; a window into the future of next-gen gaming and what it's capable of. We are addicted to its world and everything in it, so we don't mind risking our reputation saying that it's easily our game of the decade, despite it missing out on the Video Game Awards for 2020.This is a brutal, visceral world to live in, where death seeps through the concrete jungle and every job you take on feels like the beginning of your dark end in an unsympathetic landscape.Yet every time we complete a quest and receive some EuroDollars for our effort, we find ourselves itching to rush back into the gloomy, dangerous filth of Night City to discover what other horrors await us.We could wax lyrical about how good this game is for another ten years, and we still think the conversation would be relevant – so yes, we think Cyberpunk 2077 is the game of the decade. This is an event, and a big moment in gaming, because the brilliant Cyberpunk 2077 is laying down the stepping stones for greater feats in the future. If you only play one next-gen game, make it this one. Cyberpunk 2077 is out on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X | S, Xbox One, and PC on December 10.Digital Spy has launched its first-ever digital magazine with exclusive features, interviews, and videos.
