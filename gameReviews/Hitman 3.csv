Hitman 3,John Linneman,Eurogamer,https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2021-hitman-3-tech-review,"But last-gen hardware isn't left behind.Traditionally, the cross-gen period - the awkward transition from one set of consoles to the next - hasn't really worked out. There's the sense that the next-gen versions aren't necessarily everything they could be, while the software served up to owners of the older consoles often verged on the unplayable. But as move from PS4 to PS5, from Xbox One to Xbox Series, it's clear that we're seeing something very different this time around. IO Interactive's Hitman 3 shows that cross-gen can actually work out just fine, and there's the feeling that prior generation consoles are being pushed closer to their ultimate limits, while simultaneously, massive gains are achieved when playing on PS5 and Xbox Series X.Of course, Hitman 3 is a game with additional interest for us, because IO's excellent Glacier Engine has evolved, bringing impressive new features into the technology - while at the same time back-porting those innovations to the entirety of the Hitman trilogy. It's to IO's credit that with each Hitman release, and with each iteration of Glacier, existing content has been ported to the latest game, benefitting from the engine upgrades. It's doubly useful for Hitman 3 played on a next-gen console because the baseline improvements are so profound, it's effectively both a new game and a next-gen remaster of the older releases. So how has Glacier moved on? The new maps are truly effective showcases for some of the new technology and the initial Dubai mission is a beautiful debut for a range of effects - foremost amongst them the arrival of a remarkable implementation of screen-space reflections. The environment is packed with reflective surfaces including metal and glass, presented in a brightly lit manner that would make imperfections obvious, while Hitman continues to look pristine. Of course, there are limits to SSR - off-screen detail can never be reflected - but Glacier has some interesting tricks up its sleeve for enhancing the effect. So, for example, the game's signature crowds are reflected too, but it seems that these are 2D-sprite like 'imposters' to save on processing resources, while still looking very effective.All of this is achieved by building upon the existing Glacier tech, so SSR is bolstered with pleasing cubemaps (static light probes with textured surfaces that can be used to mimic reflections) along with the render-to-texture feature that debuted in Hitman 2. Here, the scene is effectively rendered twice, the secondary viewpoint mapped to a texture to deliver a 'proper' reflection. It's heavy on resources, it needs to be applied sparingly and typically it only works on flat, mirror-like surfaces - but crucially, it looks good. In time we'd hope to see full ray tracing alternatives, but for now, it does the trick - and it works on all supported consoles.If we skip ahead to a later mission, we're treated to another visually striking scenario - a rainy Chinese city at night. This map showcases another new string to Glacier's bow through the simulation of rain and wet surfaces. Raindrops realistically play off 47's coat while a nice droplet effect is crafted to represent puddles. When you make your way to the stage's main street, the combination of reflections and neon signs delivers a dark atmosphere not unlike Hitman Contracts - the original third Hitman game. It's dark, beautiful and really showcases the engine in a new light.It's also interesting to see how the new additions to the Glacier Engine feed back into the legacy Hitman content. The classic Paris stage from the original Hitman still looks wonderful to this day, but the marble flooring effect now benefits from the new SSR pass - and the content manages to run better than the original game on Series X running under backwards compatibility. It also looks as though IO has revisited the way that trees and foliage are rendered. I'm not sure there's actually much in the way of improvement as such (at least on the older maps) but it's definitely a change there. Other differences are less profound, but show an eye for detail - a static curtain may now possess cloth physics animation, for example. Overall though, it's the retrofitting of screen-space reflections that shows the biggest change - that, and performance of course. On the vanilla last-gen machines, Hitman titles could be run capped to 30fps or unlocked, while Xbox One X also benefitted from 4K quality and 1440p performance modes. In the shift to Hitman 3, all last-gen machines are capped at 30fps and there are no quality and performance modes (bar one exception, which I'll address shortly). On the one hand, Hitman 3 possesses engine upgrades and ambitions in the content that justify the limitations. On the other, Xbox One X owners in particular may prefer to retain Hitman 2 for its ability to access legacy missions at frame-rates above 30fps. The outlier here is PS4 Pro, which curiously offers both 1440p30 and 1080p60 modes. We tried the latter on the initial Dubai stage and found that while it wasn't as smooth and consistent as Xbox Series S's 1080p60 output (though curiously, shadow quality is higher), it was close enough to 60fps to make it the preferable way to play on last-gen PS4 systems. PlayStation owners also get the chance to play every mission from the entire trilogy in VR too. The compromises are self-evident, but it works. It's just a shame that to access VR on PlayStation 5, you need to run the PS4 code, doubling up on installs. It's unfortunate but it's the way that Sony chooses to set up the system, and there's nothing IO could really do here. All of which leads us on to the actual next-gen difference - why we prefer to play Hitman 3 on PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X. First of all, the bump up to full 4K (or 1800p, in the case of PS5) definitely plays a role. In the past we've talked about how image reconstruction techniques and dynamic resolution scaling make the need to deliver 8.3m pixels per frame less of a necessity, and that's definitely the case - especially in the age of temporal anti-aliasing. However, the Glacier Engine concentrates on delivering a pristine presentation that does not rely so heavily on heavy post-processing or temporal accumulation techniques to achieve its goals. Hitman 3 focuses on clean lines and well-defined spaces, where a higher resolution definitely helps. This requires brute force horsepower and that's what the new consoles deliver. Then there's the 60 frames per second update rate, and the way that a nigh-on unwavering 60fps adds further to the pristine presentation. Beyond that, Hitman 3 focuses on refinement. Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 have access to more system memory that any of their last-gen counterparts, so the equivalent of PC's ultra level textures are deployed. This is supplemented with a move to 8x anisotropic filtering, which is a nice step up from the 4x seen on the last-gen versions of the game. Shadow quality is also improved, specifically on Xbox Series X, which stands alone from all the console versions in matching PC's high preset.And in summary, that's why Hitman 3 works as a cross-gen title. Unlike the messy transition periods we've seen in the past, there are still enhancements delivered for the last-gen consoles and while we've lost the unlocked frame-rate on most of the older systems, performance is still consistent overall. I am baffled as to why Xbox One X owners don't get access to an unlocked frame-rate mode (on paper, it should run even better than PS4 Pro) but ultimately I don't feel like last-gen users get shortchanged. Meanwhile, it's clear that next-gen consoles get a more refined, smoother and prettier experience - even if there is the sense that Hitman 3 isn't specifically targeting the capabilities of the new hardware. But when a game looks as good as this, runs as well as this and features some superb new missions, it's difficult to complain. And there is one more aspect I'd like to highlight - loading times. We talked about this a touch in our platform comparison piece, but we're looking at sub-ten second loading times for all missions. In one specific case, a circa ten second mission load on Series X can take around 59 seconds on One X - and in terms of overall quality of life, that's an extreme upgrade that's well worth having, especially when it comes to reloading after death. It's the final coat of polish on what is already a gleaming package for next-gen users. Hitman 3 works for me on all the consoles I tested it on, but Series X and PS5 in particular are a class apart by virtually every measurable metric.

Hitman 3,Edwin Evans-Thirlwell,Eurogamer,https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-01-19-hitman-3-review-a-satisfying-end-to-a-beautiful-stealth-trilogy,"Providential.Hitman 3 is the final act in Agent 47's struggle against his nemeses at Providence, the illuminati-style collective of crooked politicians, crimelords and corpos introduced at the start of the World of Assassination trilogy back in 2016. I don't care much about that story, with its paint-by-numbers betrayals and toneless briefing sequences: its only virtue is to keep you moving around the globe, from one extravagant playground to another. But much to my surprise, I do care rather a lot about Agent 47, about the strange figure he cuts against the contents of his own world and the wider landscape of videogames.The big joke of 47, of course, is that you can't miss him. He stands out like, well, a menacing, chalk-white man with a barcode on his head. In the reboot trilogy, you can mingle with NPCs to throw off suspicious guards, and the impression is always of a fridge trying to blend into a flock of sheep - even the Terminator looks more natural in a crowd. Yet somehow, 47 is the ultimate shape-shifter, able to disguise himself as anyone from a celebrity DJ to a noodle chef. IO has wisely refrained from making this ability to fit in more plausible, even as it has pumped up the splendour of Hitman's locations, and the result is an assassination game that is secretly a comedy long before you start dressing up as a butler and whacking people with fish.The joke extends to the fact that Agent 47 is somewhat unconvincing as an avatar, or at least, an avatar in a game that occupies the same commercial plateau as Assassin's Creed. He's an old school anomaly carried forward from an era when ledge-mantling was an exotic practice. When he puts on a disguise, the clothes simply teleport from the victim's body to his own. When he stows a corpse, there's a slightly awkward little cutscene. I'm not convinced 47 even obeys the same laws of physics as anybody else in the game. When he's shot, it makes no impression beyond a bit of controller rumble.All which might sound like I'm having a go at the animation team. Not at all - Agent 47's blunt economy of gesture and reaction are painstakingly crafted, and there's something endearing about this early-noughties stiffness, this lack of flourish in an age when AC protagonists slink through the geometry trailing a boutique's worth of cloth and harness. Questions of development budget aside, Agent 47 doesn't need ""seamless"" transitions or grounding naturalistic touches any more than he needs a sniper drone or a holographic decoy. What he needs, mostly, is the ability to stand still and an eye for details like poorly secured chandeliers. Playing as 47 fosters a sense of eerily laidback contemplation that remains unique among stealth sims and as such, makes the absence of new features in Hitman 3 easier to swallow (though not, perhaps, the loss of features like the last game's entertaining Ghosts competitive mode). This is a sturdy third act that creeps along firmly in the footsteps of its predecessors. Whether you're trying for a main story target, or tackling one of the tougher Escalation hits with additional restrictions, the basic rhythms of the game are the same: choose a starting location and a couple of tools, then try to find your way from public areas through layers of security to your quarry's vicinity, scooping up other tools enroute, and looking out for things you can sabotage. The less noticeable you are, and the more poetic and/or bizarre your methods, the higher your score. Costumes found or taken from NPCs make you undetectable to many onlookers providing you're where you're expected to be and not doing anything odd, like slipping rat poison into somebody's cocktail or meddling with a giant mechanical sun. Agent 47's invisibility is a flexible social metaphor, revealing the presumptions of those nearby. When he poses as an executive on a factory tour, his invisibility is the armour of privilege. When he dresses as a waiter at a sky-high soiree, it's the invisibility of little people in the presence of their betters. Maps follow a complex running order, with targets moving from spot to spot: the key is working out where they'll be when, or uncovering ways of changing the pattern. The estate owner is well-defended, but perhaps if you cause havoc in the winery downstairs you can lure him into the open. The wandering programmer has a bodyguard, but perhaps you can find a way of tying the latter up while his client gets herself into hot water. Hitman 3 is most rewarding when you disable the handholds and parts of the HUD, attempting to make it through via in-world observation alone, but you'll likely follow proximity-activated Intel prompts and waypoints during your first try. These give you more of a narrative flavour and gently walk you through some fancier ways of nobbling your targets. After three WOA instalments, IO has refined the art of using story missions to introduce the areas and tantalise you with their possibilities. The meat of the game still lies in replaying with different targets and more challenging criteria, but it feels like the studio is having a bit more fun with these opening guided forays. The game's Dartmoor map, for instance, gives you the option of posing as a detective investigating a suspicious suicide, which effectively allows you to stop playing Hitman and experience the whole thing as an Agatha Christie-style whodunnit - asking for alibis, cross-referencing testimonies and tracking down clues, all of it elegantly folded into the existing intel menu system. The map itself is a nice balance of big and intimate, with a core cast of blue-bloods and hard-pressed servants, wandering the endless carpets of a gloomy mansion. Play it without disguising yourself as the detective - which, unlike most outfits, makes you completely undetectable - and it's much more challenging: guards everywhere, no public access as such, and lots of cavernous hallways with little to hide behind.The six new maps - all set in and around the sanctums of the wealthy - are on par quality-wise with those of Hitman and Hitman 2. The two standouts are probably Berlin and Argentina. The former sees you trying to expose and bump off enemy agents in a huge club built inside a decommissioned power station. There are plenty of backstage areas, elevations and ""unfortunate accidents"" to choose from, and the ambience is intoxicating - you get a main dancefloor with pyrotechnics-heavy DJ set, scattered chillout cafes and invitation-only drug dens. Argentina, meanwhile, is a sprawling and well-attended retirement party at a sunny estate with its own vineyard and a high-tech winery. It's a sumptuous layer cake: take the main road in and you'll reach a plaza where socialites dance and swap stories about the host. Further in and above, you'll find plush roof gardens and a fortified villa. It's a great fun for snipers, once you've reached the summit, but you'll find you can be just as effective with a pair of shears.The Dubai skyscraper map has some cool assassination possibilities involving skydiving, and is a stunning assemblage of gold and glass floating against a murky cloudscape. I was less taken by the China map - it's redolent of Sapienza in the first game, with a town environment concealing a huge underground data centre, but there's a little too much emphasis here on sneaking through conveniently man-sized air vents. Hitman is simply more interesting as a social stealth game than when you're lurking in crawlspaces.Carpathian Mountains is also a slight disappointment as a final map - it starts you off at the back of a speeding laboratory train and asks you to make your way to the front. The result is undeniably atmospheric but it's obviously rather linear - you're climbing onto the roof or around the outside of cars to get behind guards, and the environmental setups are more pedestrian, almost like optional tactical takedowns in a corridor shooter. That said, I have yet to replay it with different starting locations and targets - I suspect the level is more complex if you begin further up and travel backwards. The linearity is, of course, a thrown gauntlet: how creative can you be in a very confined space? All the maps are worth revisiting as much for certain deft human moments as the satisfaction of a kill. On Dartmoor, for instance, there's a security guard and a maid who keep trying to chat each other up, breaking off in embarrassment when you appear. You now have a camera which, aside from allowing you to wirelessly hack doorlocks, lets you preserve these moments, some of which are tethered to Challenges. As before, finishing a hit earns you XP towards your map mastery, unlocking new starting locations and tools. If you want to up the ante still further there's the returning Contracts mode, in which you tailor-make a hit for other players by first carrying it out yourself.
Sadly I wasn't able to try out one of Hitman 3's most promising features during my playthrough - the PlayStation VR support, which lets you wander the maps in first-person using a PS4 controller. The feature has now been added to the review build and will be a day-one update for the retail version. It only applies to the PS4 version, but this also runs on PS5 and is included free with the purchase. Eurogamer's VR connoisseur Ian Higton is even now digging his face into the functionality, and you can expect an article on the subject very soon.
The great provocative unfulfilled possibility of the World of Assassination trilogy is that maps don't really respond once you've killed somebody. Guard patrol patterns tighten up, bodies are bagged and removed, and certain bigwigs might flee to saferooms, but the mood and fundamental workings of the space carry on unaltered. I finished off my first Argentina playthrough by shooting a woman with a sniper rifle in full view of a hundred people - when I drifted through the area as a waiter a moment later it was like it had never happened. The nearest you get in Hitman 3 to a kind of map-wide ""second act"" is in China, where one of the more elaborate killing methods results in a full lockdown that drives half the workforce outside to stand gossiping in the rain.There are more down-to-earth reasons for this inflexibility - it's hard to implement that kind of change on maps this large, carefully organised and animate without breaking things and adding years to development time. But it also speaks to the plot's rather forlorn theme of a world in which you can punish individuals but never bring down the systems that facilitate their wickedness. ""There will always be people like them, so there must also be people like us,"" is one of Hitman 3's concluding lines. It's meant to sound like a victory. (It certainly leaves room for another sequel.)All the same, there is something very hopeful about Hitman, an optimism that somehow coexists with its air of absurdity. If these worlds are depraved and ridiculous, full of evil people wallowing in their own crapulence, they are always wobbling around the rim of their own undoing. Behind Agent 47's myriad disguises I sense a faith in the self-defeating logic of the universe, a conviction that if he is patient and watchful, if he only allows himself to move with the flow, the planets will align, the walls will disappear, and for a second or so, the heart of the machine will be exposed for all to see. Just long enough for him to reach out and insert a screwdriver.You're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!

Link Official site (opens in new tab)And so we've come to the end of IO Interactive's so-called World of Assassination trilogy, which began with the Danish developer's first Hitman reboot back in 2016. These are some of the best systems-driven stealth games on PC, and Hitman 3 tops the series off with a superb collection of levels—some of which are among the best in the entire Hitman series. This is a spiritual and mechanical continuation of the previous two games, but IO still has a few surprises up its sleeve. And one level in particular might just be the studio's masterpiece.I'm in an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of Berlin. Spindly lasers and spotlights sweep across a shadowy dancefloor, revealing a sea of bobbing heads hypnotised by throbbing techno music. The music is so loud, and the bass so deep, it makes my headphones vibrate. But I'm not here because Agent 47 has given up contract killing and joined the German rave scene, even though that would be a pretty funny way to end the story. I'm here to murder a team of deadly assassins who are also trying to murder me.Ten hitmen are patrolling the warehouse and a scrubby industrial wasteland surrounding it. And here's the kicker: they know what I look like, even if I'm wearing a disguise. I can still change clothes to stroll past lowly security guards, but these trained killers aren't so easily fooled. If they catch sight of me they'll open fire, which means I have to rely on those swarms of pill-popping ravers, and the maze-like architecture of the building, to conceal myself.Most Hitman targets are cowards hidden away in a fortress behind a wall of armed guards, which makes these guys so thrilling to go up against. It's a totally different dynamic, and one of the challenging missions in the trilogy as a result. There aren't even any Mission Stories in this level, the in-game hint system that usually suggests entertaining ways to kill your targets. This encourages you to experiment with the sandbox and dream up your own methods.Now all I have to do is figure out how to kill them without anyone noticing, in front of thousands of witnesses, in the middle of a raveTo complicate matters, the assassins are also disguised. To identify them I have to steal an earpiece and listen in on their conversations. When I catch one talking to their handler in instinct mode—which highlights targets, points of interest, weapons, and so on—their cover is blown and they're marked permanently on the map. Now all I have to do is figure out how to kill them without anyone noticing, in front of thousands of witnesses, in the middle of a rave. I could just shoot them and run away, of course, but that's no way to play Hitman.It seems impossible at first. Some of the targets follow routines where they're constantly surrounded by people. One of them, the leader, even has a bodyguard who never leaves his side. But the beauty of Hitman is carefully studying these big, intricate levels, making a mental map, and finding holes in the security to exploit. When you do finally manage to kill five of these assassins—enough to send the others fleeing—it feels incredible.Although Hitman 3 builds on the solid foundations laid by the first two parts of the trilogy, sharing the same AI, stealth systems, and user interface, IO has also taken this opportunity to experiment a little with its tried and tested formula. The complex, open-ended Berlin level is the most the studio has ever trusted a Hitman player to take the lead and figure things out for themselves. And in the other levels there are, surprisingly, only three Mission Stories per map, compared to an average of about ten in the previous two games' levels.The opportunities are still there: elaborate traps to set up, people to pose as, shortcuts to take, keys to swipe. They just aren't as clearly signposted this time around, forcing you to engage more with the environment around you. At its core this is still very much a classic Hitman game, but in many ways a more playful, experimental one. One level set in a dusty old mansion in Dartmoor, England sees Agent 47 posing as a private detective and solving a murder mystery straight out of an Agatha Christie novel. It's a gimmick, but a fun, unique spin on what is otherwise a fairly typical assassination mission.The mansion itself is brilliantly constructed. Long, dark corridors lined with oil paintings open up into bright, lavishly decorated drawing rooms. And behind the walls there's a labyrinth of secret passages to discover with peepholes for spying on people. There's also a wonderful feeling of isolation, with the house standing alone in an expanse of barren, overcast moorland that stretches infinitely into the distance. No one makes places quite like IO Interactive, and in Hitman 3 you'll find some of the developer's finest creations to date.Chongqing is another standout. It's a pretty straightforward mission compared to Berlin and Dartmoor, but an incredible piece of level design. Above, rain-soaked streets buzzing with fluorescent neon signs, noodle bars, apartment blocks, and winding, trash-stuffed alleyways. Below, a gleaming futuristic facility with multiple layers of security, heavily armed guards, and vent systems to slip through. This impossibly intricate double-stacked level is one of the most impressive things IO has ever created; both in terms of atmosphere and aesthetic, and in how many interesting ways there are to navigate it.As for the other levels, Hitman 3 opens with Agent 47 taking a trip to Dubai and infiltrating a glamorous soirée at the top of its tallest building. He enters the level by parachute, crawls through a window, slips into a tuxedo, and blends into the crowd—as if we needed any more proof that IO loves James Bond. It's a real visual treat too, with immense gilded palm trees, reflecting pools, and dramatic views over the cloud-covered city. But for all its glamour it's a rather simple, reserved level, feeling more like a tutorial to ease new players in.This impossibly intricate double-stacked level is one of the most impressive things IO has ever createdDubai introduces the digital camera, a largely forgettable new gadget that 47 always has in his inventory, regardless of what you selected at the mission planning phase. With it you can scan things for extra intel or hack electronic panels to trigger certain things—for instance, activating a futuristic window's frosted glass to cover you, or remotely opening a vent cover. It's a frivolous addition, really, and feels slightly out of place in a Hitman game. But the levels are almost never designed around it, so thankfully it's not too intrusive. And in its favour, I do like how you can use the zoom function to scout ahead.Later, 47 travels to Mendoza, Argentina and sneaks into yet another high-class party: this time at a winery. With golden early evening sun falling over the vineyards, it's gorgeous to look at, and a Mission Story involving a sniper is especially devilish. The level is split between the winery, where the party is being held, a scattering of rocky foothills patrolled by gaucho guards, and a colonial villa where one of your targets lives. It's another level that plays things relatively safe, but it's much more detailed and involved than Dubai.The sixth and final map, set among Romania's rugged Carpathian Mountains, isn't a typical Hitman level at all. It's more like an action set-piece, designed to finish Agent 47's story in spectacular fashion. It's a tightly choreographed, visually impressive finale, but it is, essentially, scripted. Without spoiling anything, the nature of the level means there's no room for exploration. You do get a few opportunities to flex your creativity, but mostly you're just doing what you're told. This makes it the weakest by default, even though it's crafted with the same level of care and polish that defines all of IO's levels.Over the years, IO has gotten really good at designing the many small stealth challenges that litter its levels. The placement of guards, improvised weapons, blind corners, security cameras, and places to hide bodies is often pitch perfect. There are countless tiny, satisfying moments in these levels where you're given just enough to cleverly outfox the AI and use the environment to your advantage. You rarely feel backed into a corner, or in a situation you can't find a way out of, which speaks to the quality of the game's design. And as you unlock additional tools and gadgets, the sandbox only gets deeper and more varied.Despite a couple of weaker levels, Hitman 3 is a sensational stealth game. Berlin, Chongqing, and Dartmoor represent the series at its best, which is a fine way to end the trilogy. And if you own the first two games you can—once Epic figures out how (opens in new tab)—access all of those levels here, with improved visuals and the ability to use the new game's gadgets and weapons in them. Do that, and this is easily one of the best games on PC. If this was a review of the trilogy as a whole, I'd stick a couple more points on the review score. But even on its own, Hitman 3 is a magnificent videogame and a perfect swansong for Agent 47.A beautiful, deep, and endlessly replayable murder sandbox, featuring some of the best levels in the series.If it’s set in space, Andy will probably write about it.

Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy.There's something endlessly satisfying about unpacking and mastering the Groundhog Day playgrounds of Hitman 3. It should get boring; watching the same guards patrol their patrols, or workers work and characters wander well-worn tracks you know so well. But it never gets old. Knowing there's the tiniest crack to slip through, or a moment to exploit that can leave a target oh so tragically killed is never dulled by the repetition of running and rerunning the scenario like a time traveler that can only leave the loop after meeting the right conditions. Release date: January 20, 2021
Platform(s): PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and Nintendo Switch
Developer: IO Interactive
Publisher: IO InteractiveWhat those conditions are depend on your choices as Agent 47. There's obviously an 'ideal' end to each of the six levels, defined by the story, but options unfold as you explore. It's easy to finish a path and get away cleanly, while discovering some new and more interesting way to kill a target along the way that means you have to go back and try again. I really like the tragic accidents - like a tragic fall after someone loosened a balcony handrail. Or tragic electrocution by your own art installation. Then there was someone being tragically crushed by a giant wine press. And those tragically sabotaged parachutes... What should be repetitive never is, as the reward of new opportunities constantly freshens up revisits.  It's also, for all the death, playful. There's comedy to burying someone in their own grave at a sham funeral they organised to try and hide from public view. At one point I was able to kill someone by sequentially firing key employees to chain a sequence of events together that led to a fatal workplace health and safety violation. I'm currently replaying a level because there's an option to get a target's wife to kill them that I haven't found yet and I really want to set that off. All these options mean each location is a beautiful standalone moment of worldbuilding - from the gameplay relevant lines that tease and draw you in the directions of murderous opportunities, to throwaway dialogue that flesh out incidental characters and environmental details. It's easy to get distracted following threads just because it's interesting to find out more about some cleaner's petty grudge or a guard's troublesome relationship issues. It's a story made of stories, then, but after two games of set up the main plot has a momentum behind it that makes for a coherent thriller from start to finish. You could wander through Hitman 1 and 2 loosely following the background plot of shadowy organisations and only really show up for the assassinations. You can do that here again here, obviously, but all the previous set up lands well, and there's a much more edge of the seat feel to playing the larger story as loose ends tie up and things start to get personal. Where previous games basically jumped between global locations with some arbitrary villain on-site to justify the visit, this has much more rhyme to its reason and has a stronger narrative flow to locations and story beats. There was at least one gasp from me near the start, and several 'oh I don't like where this is going at all' teeth clenches towards the end. The conclusion is particularly satisfying, and cements a far more movie feel to the events.Don't worry too much if you haven't been paying much attention though, each level still works fine on its own. The game encourages you to play certain paths the first time you reach an area to better tell the story but it's optional - you can still treat each location as a completely self-contained world to exploit, with little regard to the overall plot, if you just want to drown random bad people in their own toilet.Whatever your level of investment in the story, there's just really cool stuff to see and do. One of my favorite levels, set in a Berlin nightclub, is amazing not because of what you can do, but rather because of how it makes you feel. For reasons, Agent 47 is being hunted by multiple hidden enemies in Germany (I counted six but I can't be sure that's all), and you have to find and take out five to escape. In a packed European club. Filled with hundreds of oblivious party goers. My 'oh my God this is amazing' moment came when I located someone while on the dance floor - slipping through a huge crowd with music pounding and lights flashing, the camera panned hard left to watch the target tracking barely inches away, completely unaware of me in the throng of heaving bodies. It's an absolute rush to play that level in full secret agent mode, eliminating multiple adversaries, one at a time, without a warehouse full of party goers realizing.   All the levels continue the series' abilities to create impressive locations for different reasons. Dubai is all about the wealthy elite, with a real Bond feel to its intro. Dartmoor channels a full Knives Out-style murder mystery for you to solve; Chongqing is a stunningly labyrinthian maze of dense neon streets to uncover. The wine villa of Mendoza is a classic callback to old school Hitman, and the final level I'll leave you to discover because it's got a great 'holy shit what?' moment. All are beautifully realised and packed with detail to make sure that every possibility feels like a 'main' choice. This is, bar a few changes I'll get to later, mechanically identical to the last two games and that's not a criticism. The systems of stealth, and costume changes used to infiltrate levels has worked beautifully for years, and it feels like this instalment cashes in what the previous games have learned. Level layout and design, tool and gear placement, effortlessly pulls you through the action feeling like the greatest (pretend) assassin in the world. A basic playthrough is entertaining and exhilarating in equal amounts, with just enough risk and reward to keep an edge to subsequent replays. Plus, as you play, you unlock new gear, places to smuggle equipment into, and escalating challenges to really test your omnipotent knowledge of the timeline.Where Hitman 3 makes any changes to its formula, it's in a way that adds to the experience  without shaking things too hard. There are new shortcuts that can be permanently created in levels to allow quicker access on subsequent playthroughs. In the Berlin nightclub, for example, there's a fire escape you can open from inside that lets you skip the security check at the door forever. Tricky to reach areas might have a ladder to drop so you can reach the same spot again without multiple costume changes and 10 minutes hiding in a cupboard. When half the fun comes from rerunning scenarios to try out different options it's an unobtrusive addition that acknowledges you put the work in to reach the shortcut in the first place. Another new idea is a camera that works well when it feels relevant, but is underused. While it lets you take actual pictures in a limited photo mode, it's main use is to scan items and hack electronic locks. It only really comes into prominent use for a couple of levels and never entirely feels entirely implemented to its full potential. The one big game changer addition is a PS VR mode that, at time of writing, I've not had a chance to play as it arrives in a launch day patch. It's a shame I couldn't test it because it's definitely an interesting idea I'm excited to try. But even if the option was an unplayable mess there's still more than enough here to recommend Hitman 3 without it. This is a great end to the trilogy, with a satisfying conclusion made from enjoyable and endlessly entertaining levels.

Hitman 3,Patrick Dane,Metro GameCentral,https://metro.co.uk/2021/01/19/hitman-3-review-mission-mostly-accomplished-13925245/,"Hitman 3 offers closure for IO Interactive’s World of Assassination trilogy, but does it manage to end the reboot era on a high?Agent 47 was in a bad place before the World of Assassination trilogy came along. After 2012’s Hitman: Absolution was rejected by fans, the franchise felt like it had lost a handle on its tone and execution. When the original came out back in 2000, the grimdark game about killing people played less juvenile than it does now. With Absolution it felt like the series had gotten away from developer IO Interactive, who were struggling to nail the feel but also the form of the series.Then, in 2016, the reboot launched and proved to be the series’ salvation. It was a quiet revelation that brought a spy-tinged, world-hopping simplification to the franchise. It presented players with detailed environments that provided endless opportunities to kill targets. Canvases with which to paint your bloody masterpieces of death.Crucially, it was all so ridiculous too. The games play their over-arching story straight, with Agent 47 trying to take down an Illuminati type organisation called Providence in cut scenes between missions. However, what has made modern Hitman games great is that they find humour in unexpected places. Throwing an explosive rubber duck at a crime lord, while dressed as a mime, is just another day on the job in Hitman. Even just the ringing ‘dong’ heard when throwing a fire extinguisher at a character’s head, these games are incredible vehicles for slapstick comedy. Tom and Jerry cartoons played out in real-life.That remains true in Hitman 3. In every way, be it a pro or a con, the trilogy topper is very much a continuation of the previous games. That makes sense too. Hitman and Hitman 2 are integrated into Hitman 3, so if you own the previous two games you can load up missions right into Hitman 3 as if it was one of the game’s own. This creates a lovely, tidy package for the trilogy and highlights the game’s unwavering dedication to the form it pioneered in 2016.In terms of its systems, everything will be very familiar to fans; there is little new here to contend with that wasn’t in the previous games. You knock people out by mashing the subdue button, you can gain access to areas by picking up errant keycards or wearing the correct attire. People who might blow your cover have a white dot above their head and you can use your instinct to see through walls and locate your targets. The other games being accessible through Hitman 3 makes sense because, in many ways, they’re built as the same game.In Hitman 3, as is true in the previous two games, the true stars of the show are the open locations that act as levels. These are environments you will become intimate with as you learn their workings. The game’s campaign only houses a handful of missions, large areas that can take anywhere from 45 to 90 minutes to beat the first time through. For a full campaign, that might seem short, and it is, but the joy of Hitman is going back into these levels and exploring all they have to offer.Hidden in many corners of these immaculately realised locations are opportunities and stories. Every location, be it the world’s tallest building in Dubai or a family manor in Dartmoor, is teeming with storytelling. As you return, you’ll come to appreciate and understand the connected nature of the area and the people that inhabit it. These are intricate machines, working beautifully in-sync. You are the wrench trying to dismantle them before anyone notices.The best storytelling comes from learning about the lives of these inhabitants. Often these narratives are small, such as the politics of housemaids and the petty gossip they share between one another. Other times they are useful. You might overhear how your target has a safe in his basement and that the code could be he and his wife’s anniversary. This then leads you to do your own private investigating into what that might be, and end up having to google how long a crystal anniversary is.To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web

							videoOther times, the stories are much bigger. In one notable sequence, you can take on the role of a private investigator hired to get to the bottom of a potential murder. What follows is a bizarre Knives Out-esque story that has you establish motives and alibis for the family members, all before drawing your own conclusion. Then, of course, murdering the person who hired you, because… well, this is Hitman. It’s slightly awkward in execution but IO Interactive is having fun with what their system allows. The inventiveness it continually finds is endlessly charming.This all feeds into the inherent repeatability of these levels. You can, of course, run into a mission, take out your gun and shoot a target in the head and flee within a couple of minutes. However, the game is a beautiful reminder of the value of showmanship. You can get to point A to B quickly and get out. Or, you can meticulously set up a Heath Robinson machine of death that executes at the perfect moment. The latter always wins out, and players who dabble in the theatrics are going to have a more engrossing time.While these contained in-level narratives are a joy, the over-arching narrative on the other hand is a mess. Hitman’s story has always been somewhat secondary to the act of murdering people. Even with that being the case, this entry feels particularly confused.Even as someone interested in the story around Providence over the last two games, this conclusion fails to land. There are big character moments with twists and turns, but it’s told through just a few cut scenes between missions. That doesn’t allow the story to breathe. Things often just happen with no time for reflection or what any of this means for these characters. It has the plot points of a complex spy novel, but one that is scribbled hastily on the back of a napkin.It’s a confusing dichotomy as the game is so inherently good at telling the detailed stories of these locations, yet it so awkwardly fumbles with the narrative it has been trying to tell over three games. While that has always been the case in this trilogy, it’s felt more so than ever as Hitman 3 tries to wrap up its story.Overall, Hitman 3 is a very welcome addition to the franchise. However, it comes with a big caveat. What once was a brilliant and detailed reimagining has started to wane with age. What’s included here is a very good version of that form, but it has lost that exciting magic that made 2016 so revolutionary for the franchise. That doesn’t come from inherent fault or mishandling from IO Interactive, but rather from familiarity.Instead of a full sequel, it feels more like an expansion. A beefy content drop built within the same game engine. The innovation comes in the wonderful maps, providing you with a stage to realise your deadly machinations. It doesn’t come from any significant overhaul of what already exists.Sony forced to reveal PlayStation exclusive deals by US senatorSuper Mario movie could make Nintendo $1,100,000,000 as it continues to break recordsDead Island 2 leaks 30 minutes of gameplay footage - still looking really goodWhile a bittersweet sentiment, this feels like the perfect time for the franchise, in this form, to sign off. Getting out before it becomes tired. The trilogy is excellent and being able to house all three games in this tidy package is a great way to experience it. Agent 47 has had an excellent run over the last five years.This system and the freedom it gives players allows for so many emergent goofs and gaffes and Hitman 3 provides more of that in spades, even if it has started to show slight signs of stagnation. However, considering where the series was before this trilogy, IO Interactive can consider this mission accomplished.In Short: A great finale to the World of Assassination trilogy and the perfect time to end the reboot era, as the once revolutionary formula begins to show its age.Pros: Houses some of the best locations of the trilogy, with Dubai and Dartmoor being all-time greats. The missions have deep interconnected stories you can get lost in for hours. Housing all three games under one roof makes a tidy package.Cons: It feels like an expansion rather than a true sequel. The game looks and plays the same, and the overarching story is utterly bungled.

Hitman 3,Jeff Cork,Game Informer,https://www.gameinformer.com/review/hitman-3/hitman-3-review-a-killer-conclusion,"Agent 47 has been an arbiter of death for decades now, using his finely honed skillset in a variety of dirty business around the world. With Hitman 3, his World of Assassination trilogy comes to its inevitably bloody end. Over these three games, IO Interactive boldly set out to create a seamless Hitman experience that felt consistent, from the tutorial mission to the conclusion. After playing through this stunning finale, I’m relieved that the studio stuck the landing. Every mission in the final arc is a statement, demonstrating a mastery of level design and a darkly playful willingness to subvert expectations laid out five years ago. Hitman 3 is not a good place to begin your Hitman journey, but it’s a satisfying way to say goodbye.Hitman has always been about dropping players in unfamiliar locations, giving them a target, and then letting them run wild. The most recent games have taken that design philosophy to new heights. At its best, Hitman offers an experience like no other, delivering intricately crafted scenarios and giving players the tools they need to tackle missions in different ways. The first time I explored Hitman 3’s bombastic opening mission in Dubai, I methodically explored as much of the Sceptre skyscraper as I could before killing my targets. Hours later, I was able to efficiently roll through without dawdling, killing both without anyone even knowing I was ever there. It’s like visiting a supermarket; sometimes you want to comparison shop, and other times you just want to grab some milk and get out of the store. Hitman 3 introduces new elements, including a camera gadget, but the most notable are its persistent shortcuts. By unlocking specific doors or accessing ladders, those newly available paths are open to you on subsequent runs. They’re a great compliment to the series’ unlockable starting locations, ultimately giving you the ability to bypass sections of a level and make a beeline for whatever – or whoever – you’re most interested in pursuing. I loved meeting a partygoer outside of Berlin’s nightclub area and getting a guided tour of the map, but was relieved when I found a side door that let me slip right past him and security. Some shortcuts are in riskier locations, so you have to weigh that additional danger, but I enjoyed having access to more options.IO Interactive has been crafting these types of missions for years now, and that experience shows. Nearly every mission introduces something that upends what longtime players have come to expect. The end goal of killing your targets is always part of the deal, but Hitman 3 proves that there’s still plenty of room for more variety. One mission offers a lengthy (and optional) murder mystery to solve, putting you in the unusual role of private investigator and interrogator. In another, you begin without having any knowledge of your targets’ identities. Working without intel, you have to methodically observe and listen to conversations before springing into action. If you’re impatient, you can simply go on a rampage and hope for the best. Five of the six levels offer up a wealth of improvisational opportunities; I spent nearly two hours infiltrating a high-tech firm in China, and was captivated by just about every moment. The final mission is more linear than the others, but it’s no less satisfying.Hitman 3 is a worthy conclusion to the trilogy, but if you haven’t been impressed with previous entries it’s not likely to change your mind. Its improvements, welcome as they may be for longtime fans, are incremental upgrades rather than the larger leaps that you might be accustomed to seeing in more traditional sequels. I enjoy its slow-burn pacing and love the tension that comes from slipping past guards unnoticed. I love looking at each level as its own weird puzzle, and something about poking the simulation to see what is and isn’t possible really clicks with me. However, if you think the previous two installments have mediocre gunplay or find them too fussy, those elements haven’t changed. You can technically jump into Hitman 3 without playing the previous games, but that is doing yourself a disservice. Much of the game’s emotional and narrative weight hinges on you having experienced the trilogy.Hitman 3 concludes a chapter in the greater Hitman story, but it doesn’t feel like an ending. There’s an  abundance of content and side activities on offer, and the trilogy as a whole is bound to be a long-term destination for would-be assassins. IO Interactive’s final act in the trilogy anticipates and rewards player experimentation, features meticulous level design, and has moments of ghoulish catharsis that makes me cackle aloud. My enthusiasm for it all is as indelible as the barcode tattooed on the back of Agent 47’s head.This review is based solely on the PC version of Hitman 3. At the time of this writing, the review code for the PlayStation version of the game was unavailable, so we’re unable to evaluate its performance (or its VR capabilities) on consoles.

Hitman 3,Mike Mahardy,Polygon,https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23581384/hitman-3-freelancer-mode-roguelike-world-of-assassination,"Filed under:Freelancer mode is a rare amalgamation of challenge and approachabilityThe modern Hitman trilogy — or rather, Hitman World of Assassination, as it’s now known — has always flirted with the roguelike genre. As the blank slate Agent 47, you drop into clockwork missions in far-flung locales, exploiting targets’ routines and generally wreaking havoc as creatively as you can. On one run, you poison a target, follow them to the bathroom, and drown them in the toilet mid-puke. On the next, having unlocked a new infiltration point and a corresponding disguise, you swap out a golf ball for its explosive twin, watching with glee from the garden as your target then plows a 9-iron into his unexpected demise. Polygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences. When we award the Polygon Recommends badge, it’s because we believe the recipient is uniquely thought-provoking, entertaining, inventive, or fun — and worth fitting into your schedule. If you want curated lists of our favorite media, check out What to Play and What to Watch.For more than 22 years, developer IO Interactive has honed its talent for extracting joy from repetition. With its newly released mode, one that fully earns the roguelike moniker, it has almost achieved perfection.As free DLC goes, Freelancer mode is less “additional content” and more “sweeping reimagining.” Whereas the base trilogy encourages replaying the same mission over and over — the better to execute more ingenious and hilarious kills — Freelancer prohibits repeats. You plan a mission with what limited intel you have, improvise in the field, and move on to the next location. This new gameplay loop revolves around taking down four syndicates across increasingly lengthy series of missions. The first syndicate requires completing two missions before luring out its leader. At that point, you drop into the final location, identify the leader by patiently watching for “tells,” and eliminate them. To complete a run, or “campaign,” you need to kill all four syndicate leaders without dying. In total, you’re looking at 18 locations. (If it sounds complicated, don’t worry: IO made a pre-brief tutorial video, which you can watch here.)Of course, this being a roguelike, you’re probably going to die — a lot. When you perish, you start a new campaign from the beginning, shuffling the targets, locations, and items, along with a multitude of modifiers and random events. You even lose any lock picks, sedatives, or explosives you had collected in your previous run. The only constant? Your safehouse.

  As the obsession with video game “hub worlds” only continues to grow, IO has crafted a fortress of solitude to rival the best of them. Agent 47’s bunker-beneath-a-house is sleek, utilitarian, and, for the world’s foremost assassin, surprisingly cozy. I’m reminded of the house in Ex Machina. By rising through the mastery ranks of Freelancer mode, you can unlock new rooms, earn more decorations, and fill in the gaps on those weapon walls that every spy worth their salt seems to have. The safehouse, unlike your tools, missions, or targets, does not reset between runs, and improving it is nearly as satisfying as fleshing out Zagreus’ house in Hades. But while that corner of the underworld is replete with friends and family members, in Hitman World of Assassination’s Freelancer mode, Agent 47 is more alone than usual.A sense of isolation is paramount in Freelancer, not only in tone, but in function. Whereas Agent 47 had the backing of the International Contract Agency in the vast majority of the trilogy’s missions, the reticent assassin has since gone... well... freelance. Hence the need to build the safehouse and arsenal from scratch — but also the need to sift through intel on your own. Series mainstay Diana Burnwood is still here (and still voiced by the phenomenal Jane Perry, of course) to offer a guiding hand, praise successful missions, and bemoan your fuck-ups. But as far as choosing which four syndicates to pursue on any given run — that’s on you.Herein lies the brilliant fulcrum of Freelancer mode. Each of the eight randomized syndicates (represented as tidy dossiers) has randomized optional objectives that cater to certain play styles. Complete these tasks, and you’ll earn a currency called “merces,” which you can spend at disguised suppliers scattered throughout each mission.These optional objectives are just as much a boon as they are a way for IO to push you out of your comfort zone. During my third campaign, I opted to hunt a human trafficker, whose optional objectives mostly revolved around pure stealth. This being my preferred play style in the base trilogy, I had few problems eliminating the low-rung syndicate members with my bare hands, hiding them in freezers, and vanishing without a trace. By the time I arrived at the Isle of Sgàil to erase the leader, I had built up a helpful assortment of lock picks, wrenches, and nonlethal poisons, and completed the job without much ado.I had also, by happenstance, added a few guns to my weapon wall, and decided to shake things up with my second syndicate: a group of arms dealers. The optional objectives for these missions required going loud, as they say — killing three guards with a shotgun, eliminating a target with a sniper rifle, and so forth. While these didn’t conform to my usual methods, this syndicate would bring me to some of my favorite locations (Whittleton Creek, New York, Berlin, and the Maldives). How did it go? Not great, Bob! Because I went guns blazing at the first two locations, I spooked the higher-ups in subsequent locations. These missions gained the “On Alert” status, making it far more difficult for me to sneak through them unnoticed, regardless of my disguise. I spawned in the parking garage in New York, botched a strangle attempt, and fell to the ground in a storm of lead.There’s an array of other modifiers and randomized events that can pop up in each campaign, but frankly, I don’t want to spoil them here. Half of the fun of Freelancer mode is breezing through one or even two syndicates, only to open your third dossier and realize how much your greed for merces has screwed you over. But you drop into the next location anyway, because improvising is half the fun — and half the comedy — of this excellent series. Hitman’s Freelancer mode is something rare: an intoxicating blend of challenge and approachability. It plays on the hubris of longtime players, but also guides newcomers with thematic objectives and a more explicit overall structure. It may not allow for the micro-repetition that makes the base trilogy tick. But it does maintain a rapid momentum from the beginning of each run to its bitter, comical end. After so many hours spent with this trilogy, combing each of its locations for something, anything I missed, I did not think it possible for IO to surprise me anymore — but here we are. Hitman World of Assassination’s Freelancer mode was released on Jan. 26 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. The DLC was reviewed on Xbox.

    Phil Hornshaw
   on January 19, 2021 at 9:46AM PSTSince it rebooted its Hitman franchise in 2016, IO Interactive has been putting on a level design masterclass. Each of the missions the developer rolled out in what it calls its World of Assassination series has contained a huge, intricate collection of scripted and free-form systems that create harrowing moments, presented elaborate puzzles to solve, and allowed the player to orchestrate ludicrous and often hilarious situations. Levels are designed to be played over and over so you can explore, understand, and eventually master all their moving parts, and it's impossible to see everything one has to offer in a single playthrough (or in most cases, even two or three).At first blush, Hitman 3 appears to be more of the same. It makes no drastic changes to the underlying formula, instead adding a few graphical upgrades and quality-of-life improvements to the existing Hitman framework. But Hitman 3 improves on the World of Assassination through consistently excellent level design--which is saying something, given how strong all the previous missions are. Hitman 3 is full of fun and fascinating ideas, many of which play with the concepts underpinning the last four years of Hitman levels.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Hitman 3 ReviewPresumably knowing that players have spent all sorts of time mastering its many settings and systems, IO throws in some brilliant curve balls that require you to use your assassin skills and knowledge in clever, challenging new ways.In Hitman 3, all the stealth mechanics, the ways you can interact with the world, and enemy AI remain the same as in the past. That's essential to how Hitman works, however--your knowledge and understanding of the game's underlying systems are what make it possible to replay levels again and again to exploit their intricacies in different ways. Rather than feel dated, Hitman 3 just highlights how satisfying it can be to understand how all these moving pieces work together. There aren't any major mechanical additions to the game's construction, but seeing how it all harmonizes is as impressive today as it was when the first entry in the World of Assassination trilogy launched in 2016.In each of the game's locations, your goal is to find a way to eliminate your assassination targets and then escape the level without being found out. You do that largely by knocking out enemies, hiding their bodies, and taking their clothes. Some areas are restricted based on what you're wearing, and some enemies can still see through your disguises, requiring you to carefully avoid them. Agent 47 has the benefit of Instinct, a vision mode that lets him intuit where enemies are through walls and which highlights interactive items in the environment.As you sneak around each level, your goal is to try to uncover information that will help you get close to your targets and eliminate them. Those assassinations can be accomplished in simple ways, such as shooting them or strangling them with a garrote, or more complex ones like exposing an electrical wire in a puddle and then turning on a nearby switch to electrocute your prey. The stealthier (and less deadly to non-targets) you are, the better your score at the end of a level, and each stage is full of challenges to complete that encourage you to find weird and creative ways to take out your mark, without anyone knowing you were ever there. The more challenges you complete, the more you ""master"" a level, which unlocks additional starting locations and loadout options to change the experience even more. Part of what sets Hitman 3's levels apart from those of Hitman 1 and 2 is how they fit into the overall story that IO has been telling in this series. In the past, each of Hitman's levels has functioned as a mostly standalone chapter in the tale of titular assassin Agent 47. You'd go into a location with one or more targets, and each mission had a bit of story about the people you were after, which doubled as an opportunity to get close to them.But those targets were usually somewhat tangentially related to what was going on in the unfolding story of Agent 47 and his handler, Diana Burnwood. Across Hitman 1 and 2, the pair slowly realized that they were unwitting participants in a war between the Shadow Client, a guy who was carefully manipulating them through their assassination contracts, and Providence, an Illuminati-like organization of world-controlling super-rich people. In Hitman 3, Agent 47 and Burnwood are fully involved in the battle against Providence after the events of Hitman 2, and that larger story is finally at the forefront of everything that's going on.That means that missions feel like they have a bigger impact and targets are more interesting and make more sense. The characters you eliminate have consequences for the story, and those consequences lead to imaginative takes on the series formula as 47's enemies try to fight back against him. After developing a brilliant mold for Hitman missions, where you're dropped into an often-huge area and have to learn to understand how it works to accomplish your goals, IO breaks that mold again and again to create fun, memorable, inventive assassination experiences.Much has already been made of the excellent second mission, set in Dartmoor, England, where you're trying to assassinate a target in the middle of what is essentially a riff on the movie Knives Out or any number of Agatha Christie stories. You're planning a murder of your own, but one has just taken place in the huge mansion where your target is staying, and you can even take on the role of private investigator and search for clues to figure out whodunit. It feels like taking a brief vacation in the middle of Hitman 3 to play another game, but the brilliance of the murder mystery's addition is that the whole time you're solving it, you're thinking about how you can use the information you learn to your advantage to finish your assassination. Your inquiry might let you expose the murderer, or frame someone else for the crime, or give you ammunition for a blackmail threat, depending on how much you explore. It's a three-dimensional chess game where you're not only putting the clues together to close the case, but also thinking ahead to what opportunities your actions might offer you, and it's an absolutely phenomenal expansion of how Hitman's intricate levels already work. Later missions also put intelligent spins on the series framework. Just about every Hitman mission up to now has given you a briefing about your targets and lets you plan your starting point and weapon loadout--so one mission robs you of all your preparatory information, dropping you into an unfamiliar location and forcing you to wing it, locating your targets and learning what you can about them on the fly. Another mission takes the things that work about Hitman--sneaking past guards, donning disguises, using the environment to distract or pacify enemies--and shrinks the scope from its normally expansive settings to a tight, crowded train, so that every move and decision you make has to be quick and calculated. There’s a mission that purposely leaves you on the back foot at one point when an alarm is activated, forcing you to sneak or fight your way to safety as guards search for you.None of Hitman 3's missions change how you've played these games since 2016. They don't throw new mechanics at you (other than a camera that can scan some objects and persistent shortcuts that give you new opportunities for assassinations) or require you to learn to deal with new enemy behaviors. Instead, Hitman 3 finds new ways to challenge seasoned assassins purely through excellent design. You've honed your assassination skills--but can you solve a mystery? Can you avoid other hidden, disguised assassins hunting you? Can you sneak out of a locked-down facility full of soldiers who know you're there? It's a fitting testament to how strong the World of Assassination games have been all along that IO can make Hitman 3 feel fresh and new simply by finding creative new ways to take advantage of the series' design foundations.The drawback of Hitman 3 is that, while the missions often feel even more ambitious in intricacy than those of the past, the game itself is scaled down somewhat as an overall package. Gone are some additions that appeared in Hitman 2, including the competitive Ghost mode and cooperative Sniper Assassin missions (the Sniper Assassin missions still exist as single-player experiences, but only if you own the content from Hitman 2).There's an argument to be made that IO has maintained its focus on what people like about the series in Hitman 3 while letting experiments that worked less well fall away, but it still feels like there's a bit less game here than in the past. That said, the World of Assassination games also have excelled with their post-release content, and we know that the timed Elusive Target missions are making a return at some point, which softens the blow of multiplayer mode losses. There's also the addition of virtual reality support for PlayStation players, allowing you to play Hitman 3 in first-person mode (along with all the missions from Hitman 1 and 2, if you own them), although we played on PC and thus couldn't test it. And as with Hitman 2, Hitman 3 functions as a platform for past games' levels, so you can play everything from Hitman 1 and 2 with your new unlocked weapons and Hitman 3's improvements. Continuing to have access to all Hitman content in one place is a nice addition, although you have to have purchased it all at some point or another.What's good about Hitman--its level design and the creativity, experimentation, and exploration that affords--is great in Hitman 3. It closes out the trilogy by brilliantly playing off everything that came before it, making use of and then subverting expectations, and rewarding players for their willingness to master the complexity of both its individual levels and the series as a whole.

Hitman 3,Samit Sarkar,Polygon,https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22237877/hitman-3-review-io-interactive,"Filed under:IO Interactive delivers a terrific, thrilling finale for its trilogyThe Hitman series has always been defined by its openness, allowing players to assume the role of the peerless assassin known as Agent 47 and take out targets however they please. But there’s something fascinating and, for this franchise, novel about Hitman 3, the final entry in IO Interactive’s World of Assassination trilogy: The story that the game’s writers have crafted matters at least as much as Hitman’s play-it-your-way spirit.IO has said that it considers certain assassinations to be the “canonical” endings for some of this trilogy’s missions. That’s never been more true than in Hitman 3, which occasionally signals that it wants you to make a particular decision, and reinforces it with a cutscene afterward that follows directly from the choice in question.Of course, the push and pull between interactivity and authored narrative plays on the essence of 47’s job itself: He is a laboratory-engineered contract killer, designed to be the perfect hired gun, always carrying out someone else’s orders rather than acting of his own volition.Polygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences. When we award the Polygon Recommends badge, it’s because we believe the recipient is uniquely thought-provoking, entertaining, inventive, or fun — and worth fitting into your schedule. If you want curated lists of our favorite media, check out What to Play and What to Watch.Indeed, IO’s entire trilogy touches on ideas of power, control, and self-determination. The group known in the games’ fiction as Providence is a global cabal of elites who shape world events from behind the scenes; the organization’s ethos is that it must guide the course of history because the masses are incapable of choosing the right path themselves. But what happens when some of the blunt tools through which Providence wields its extraordinary power — 47 and his long-lost friend Lucas Grey, a fellow trained assassin — gain an understanding of their humanity, and seek to exercise free will?This is heady stuff for a video game franchise that alternates between operatic drama and goofy hijinks, and it has mostly remained in the background until now. Hitman 3 plays it up, making for a brilliant conclusion to the trilogy. The game is remarkable not just for its masterful level design and its penchant for turning familiar elements of the series on their heads, but for how skillfully it brings to bear the accumulated weight of its characters’ actions — and brings it crashing down on their heads with devastating consequences.If it seems surprising to spend so much time in a review of a Hitman game talking about its story, well, I’m right there with you. It was so convoluted and barely comprehensible in 2016’s episodic Hitman that I couldn’t bring myself to care. In Hitman 2, the writers spent more time developing the characters, not merely tossing in ha-that’s-neat references and callbacks to the events of the preceding game. It’s tough to build sympathy for a couple of cold-blooded killers, but IO managed to do so with key revelations about 47’s early life, his childhood friendship with Grey, and his relationship with his handler, Diana Burnwood.For people new to Hitman, the ideal way to experience the World of Assassination trilogy is to play through all three games in Hitman 3. IO Interactive has spruced up the locations from the first two titles with the third game’s improved graphics, animation, and AI. I returned to Hitman’s very first level, Paris, and was stunned by the appearance of beautiful reflections on nearly every shiny surface, such as the glossy hardwood floors of the museum at which the mission takes place. I also loved being able to play through past locations with all of my progression tracked in one place. In the preview build of Hitman 3 that I played for my impressions piece earlier this month, I completed the first four missions of Hitman in addition to the first two of Hitman 3, bringing my profile all the way up to level 73. And I unlocked a Burj al-Ghazali snow globe in Dubai that I could use in any other location in the trilogy! (I was unable to test the feature that allows players to import progression and unlocks from Hitman 2, because it relies on an IO Interactive website that is not yet active, and anyway, I played the first two games on consoles.)Running Hitman 3 on a PC with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 Super GPU, an Intel Core i5-7500 processor, and 16 GB of RAM, I was able to play on max settings at 60 frames per second — with some drops to the mid-40s in certain areas, and a few rare instances of extreme stuttering — at my monitor’s native resolution of 1920x1200.I did run into some apparent bugs with not getting credit for certain challenges, like one in which you have to take a photo during a family meeting in Dartmoor and another in Mendoza that asks you to pacify someone with a particular item. But the most annoying issue for me was how often Hitman 3 pings its servers. My internet connection was stable, but these check-ins would occasionally halt the experience with a pop-up and sometimes even tell me that the game was disconnected from the servers. Most notably, this happened during the game’s final cinematic — which caused the cutscene to end prematurely and transition to the credits.Hitman 2 ended on a high note, with Agent 47 and his cohorts managing to capture Arthur Edwards, aka the Constant. This figure works for the Providence Partners, the three leaders of the secret society, who all come from old-money families. At the start of Hitman 3, 47’s team intends to extract information from the Constant so the group can take out the Partners and destroy Providence. But Edwards is a master manipulator, and he has a few tricks left up his sleeve.Hitman 3 weaves a globe-trotting tale featuring many hallmarks of the spy genre. Trust is a tenuous, risky concept, and allegiances are liable to change at a moment’s notice. Do the members of Providence have the luxury of trusting anyone? Diana has nurtured and guided 47’s growth as an assassin, but is she using him for her own ends?It’s only natural for IO to have foregrounded the story as it brought the trilogy to its thrilling end. Moreover, the story is the driving force behind the way you actually play Hitman 3.Of the six missions in Hitman 3 — set in Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Dartmoor, U.K.; Berlin; Chongqing, China; Mendoza, Argentina; and Romania’s Carpathian Mountains — only two begin in traditional Hitman fashion, with 47 simply showing up at a location, ready to get to work. The other missions grabbed me and didn’t let go by way of unconventional introductions, like a vertigo-inducing infiltration of the world’s tallest building and an unsettling nighttime exploration of a deserted gas station. I also delighted in being challenged to think on my feet more, as 47 often had to start a mission without his usual gear or concealed weapon. And when a story turn altered the standard handler/assassin setup, I realized just how much I had grown accustomed over the past two games to Diana’s lively, suggestive narration and to the crutch of a detailed briefing on the mission’s targets.IO also delivers new levels of free-form assassination in Hitman 3, impressive even for a franchise renowned for its sandbox environments. “Apex Predator,” which takes place around an underground dance club in an industrial zone on the outskirts of Berlin, is a highlight in this respect. It surprised me at every turn, dropping me off in a strange place without any briefing or weapons and forcing me to improvise. As I explored the area, gained intel, and figured out who my targets were, my objectives evolved. This mission comes at a point in the campaign where it feels like 47 has been pitted against the world; it’s a terrific synthesis of story and gameplay.Argentina’s “The Farewell” isn’t the final mission of Hitman 3, but it feels like a culmination of everything the franchise has been building toward — like IO wanted to turn all the dials up to 11. The Mendoza location itself is a sprawling playground: an opulent retirement gala set at a winery built into a cliff, with vineyards stretching toward a lakeside town in the distance and a villa overlooking it all. For the first time, Diana herself is in play, and potentially in danger. Mendoza contains what is now, I think, my favorite assassination in the entire Hitman franchise. All I will say is that it involves winemaking machinery and some ... assistance.The mission also makes perhaps the best use of a few mechanics that are new to Hitman 3: security keypads, time limitations, and 47’s camera/scanner. All of those elements converge if you choose to attempt the daring theft of a priceless bottle of wine: I had to disable security measures at a computer terminal, then run downstairs within one minute — as an on-screen timer counted down the seconds before the security would be reactivated — and punch in a four-digit code to access the chamber holding the bottle. (I had overheard the code when I broke into the venting corridors below the room, a feat I accomplished by using the scanner to hack the tunnels’ access doors.) It all made me feel like a badass super spy.Hitman 3 gameplay preview: Dubai, Dartmoor levels are a terrific startThat’s not to say the other locations lack stunning vistas or incredible level design, whether it’s a rain-soaked, neon-lit district of Chongqing, and the verticality of its densely packed buildings, or the secrets in the walls of Dartmoor’s Thornbridge Manor. The lone exception is the epilogue in Romania, which is disappointing in how circumscribed the experience is, playing out more like a certain Bong Joon Ho film than a typical Hitman level. Yet it still makes room for a couple of Hitman 3’s persistent shortcuts — doors (and, in some places, ladders) that must be unlocked from one side and will remain available in future playthroughs once unlocked. I can’t wait to revisit the game and try to speedrun missions with the help of these pathways.I don’t want to overstate the degree to which Hitman 3 is a departure from its predecessors. The moment-to-moment gameplay remains focused on Agent 47 sneaking past people (or donning disguises to hide in plain view) so he can put himself in position to commit murder. In some sense, it is a sequel very much like Hitman 2, with new targets to take down in six new locations, and some additional toys and tactics with which 47 can accomplish his goals. But I very much appreciated the twists and wrinkles that IO threw into the Hitman formula this time around, many of them steered by the story.That’s a clear sign that in concluding its beloved trilogy, IO felt it necessary to exert a stronger degree of narrative control and prioritize its own story over the open-ended nature of Hitman. The studio put a heavier hand on the wheel, but the trade-off is absolutely worth it.Deciding the answers to these big game design questions is the kind of thing you can do when you return to being an independent studio, and gain the self-determination to tell the story you want to tell while staying true to the franchise you’ve been working on for more than two decades. I’m amazed that IO pulled off that delicate balancing act in Agent 47’s finest adventure to date. Hitman 3 will be released Jan. 20 on Google Stadia, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.

Hitman 3,Riley MacLeod,Kotaku,https://kotaku.com/hitman-3-the-kotaku-review-1846083354,"Hitman 3 made me care more about its plot than crafting the perfect murder. The narrative, which I usually see as a flimsy excuse to play dress-up and cause globe-spanning mayhem, bleeds into the structure of its levels and creates some unexpected moments of emotion and vulnerability. Its dark story plays with the lie at the heart of Hitman’s gameplay: Agent 47 can easily slip into the life of a waiter, or a musician, or a model, but who is he really, and who, if anyone, does he want to be?Hitman has always been a weird blend of humor and darkness, a series where an end-of-mission score lures you toward perfection while the game itself lets you bumble around doing whatever you want. It’s hilarious and satisfying to drown a target in a toilet after they get sick off food you poisoned, or watch their body fly into the air after they strike an exploding golf ball you planted. But that stands alongside the fact that, as Agent 47, you play as a cruel, dishonest man who will kill whoever he’s told to further the interests of the powerful, shadowy figures who call the shots. Hitman games feel classier than might be imagined if you explained their title and premise to someone who doesn’t play games, but their stealth elegance covers up what is, at its core, an ugly fantasy of power and violence. They make me feel smart, but the pleasure I find in them feels gross to justify.Developers at IO Interactive have called Hitman 3 the end of the modern trilogy, and as such, they seem to face these contradictions of the series head on in this game, stripping away characters’ justifications and forcing them to take an honest look at themselves and their actions. For a lot of the game, I didn’t lose myself in a Hitman fantasy of parties, mastery, and bloodshed. I felt distinctly like I was playing as Agent 47, with all the pain and darkness someone who lives in a world of murder would inevitably bring crashing down on themselves.$70 off these best-in-class wireless headphonesGizmodo reviewed them and declared them to be “annoyingly incredible.""I’m not going to spoil any of it for you; I wouldn’t, even if I could. PR for IO Interactive provided us with full code about a week before launch. In exchange, I agreed not to discuss any major plot details, nor any specifics about a murder mystery subplot in the game’s second location, Dartmoor. There’s plenty to talk about without getting into spoilers, though, and I’m eager to hear what other players think of the game’s story and how they solved its many challenges once the game launches on Wednesday.Hitman 3 begins where Hitman 2 left off, with Agent 47 and his childhood friend Lucas Grey closing in on the Partners and the mysterious Constant who was the force behind the action of Hitman 2. Usually, Hitman plots don’t interest me much, too full of acronym-laden agencies and references to series events of which I only have the faintest grasp. That’s here too, but the story quickly becomes about the relationships characters have with one another, how they feel about what they’re doing, and how long they can live with how it feels to do it. In gameplay, Agent 47 is still the blank slate he’s always been, who can capably do any job and fit admirably into any pair of pants. But I found myself playing an angrier, messier 47 as well. Moments when I felt clever or powerful didn’t feel as good as they usually do; they felt more like the lies they’ve always been. Sometimes, I didn’t care about doing things well; I just wanted to get things done.Hitman 3 has six levels. The game feels small and focused, with less of the narrative contortions Hitman usually employs to find an excuse to jetset you around the world. But most levels took me longer to complete than I’m used to, either through lengthy story missions or because it took me a long time to get my bearings in complicated areas with lots of pieces. The opening level of Dubai and the vineyard in the fourth level of Argentina felt the most like the levels I know and love from the modern Hitman games: glamorous locations full of secrets and disguises, where I could enjoy dressing up in fancy clothes and eavesdropping on insufferable rich people. They’re largely the glitzy playgrounds full of possible accidents that I’m excited to replay to see how far I can push them.Many story missions are more complex than they’ve been in the past. One in the China level ended with an intriguing puzzle that I made even more complicated for myself by overthinking it. A story mission I chose in Argentina made the plot of the level go very differently for me than a colleague who chose different options, though we both got the same narrative result. The murder mystery in Dartmoor, the second level, is by far the most involved, giving 47 almost full run of a huge, stately mansion and the obligation, in the guise of a detective, to go snooping around everyone’s business the way you’d usually do more covertly. The mystery itself didn’t quite grip me—the characters are fun, but there are a lot of them, and I found the stakes hard to become invested in given 47's ultimate murderous goal. But it was an interesting, enjoyable twist on Hitman to actually get to know the people who populate a level, to become familiar with their emotions and motivations instead of just their patrol patterns.""I will leave you to prepare.""Agent 47 character studyExciting story, twists on the usual Hitman formula, lots of funny momentsIn-game camera could be a little clunky, door codes and shortcuts didn't feel like they added muchIO InteractivePC (played), Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, StadiaJanuary 20, 2021Around 15 hoursThe camera, one of Hitman 3’s new tools, features heavily in Dartmoor. Throughout the game, you use it to scan for clues indicated by an icon on the minimap, which will give you intel on people or locations. Scanning some locks in levels can open them, though the option arose less than I expected. I found the camera a bit finicky; it could be hard to tell exactly what my map icon was guiding me toward, which was annoying when scanning the right object was necessary to progress a story mission. It wasn’t as robust a tool as I’d imagine it to be, but it was, on occasion, fun to have in my arsenal.There are also shortcuts, passageways barred from one side that become permanently opened once you unlock them. Some doors also require codes, which you type into keypads by hand, meaning you can’t use them for a quick escape. I found myself paying a lot more attention to the specifics of the environment than I usually do: parsing out exactly where a room might be in a building to see if there was another way in, or listening more closely to people around me who might be engaging in the stealth game tradition of loudly discussing secret codes. These are minor changes, and while I sometimes found them slightly more annoying than interesting, they encouraged me to relate to the game’s environments in a new way that emphasized Hitman 3’s departure from the rest of the series.The story and mission format soon take a turn, and I felt off-balance for a lot of the game, even when levels like Argentina had a more familiar setup. I felt vulnerable and outmatched as I worked my way through a Berlin level, a crowded nightclub full of disorienting lighting and multiple targets who can see through every one of your disguises. My kills in the level were ultimately artless and desperate, visceral in a way I’m not used to in a Hitman game.Things got messy for me in the later levels. In one, I resorted to grabbing a gun and simply mowing down the enemies in my way, a play that can feel like a cardinal sin in a Hitman game but felt like the right choice at the time. Other moments required me to act quickly or make a decision with whatever knowledge I had at hand rather than giving me the time to plan a more elegant approach. I forgot about trying to perfect my score, drawn into the moment more than all the Hitman meta that surrounds it. A lot of Hitman 3 feels violent and dangerous, strange for a game that’s usually leisurely and cerebral, but also fitting for the series’ story and world.Perhaps as a result this narrative turn, Hitman 3's absurdity and humor stood out sharply as a welcome contrast. While Hitman 3 is darker than previous games, there’s still a lot of quirky characterization and fourth wall-breaking moments. In one level, a character told another that the code to a door was a historically significant year, adding “shame on you” if they had to look it up, which paused me in real life mid-reach for my phone. In an action-heavy late-game mission, a soldier I passed while disguised asked me if I’d bring him a soda on my way back, which felt surreal and hilarious given the absolute carnage I’d left just out of his view. While blending in in China, a woman standing next to 47 asked him for advice about a personal situation, and they had an adorable conversation before 47 got back to murdering. Berlin’s loneliness was alleviated by a dorky raver who showed me around the level, making heavy-handed references to “vitamins” and “allergy pills” until I wished I had the option to slap him.Even when I was on familiar ground—”safe” in my disguise, surrounded by pretentious and gullible targets, armed with all my secret gadgets and intel—I felt aware of who 47 actually is: lonely and out of place, with few friends and little control over his life. Whatever humanity he might have is twisted up in the machinations of power and capital that he’s both part of and fights against. “Who will you be without a score to settle?” Lucas Grey asks him early in the game, and it’s a question I often turned over as Hitman 3 played out. Essentially, he’d be no one—but then he’s always been that, really; all the rest of his identity is just make believe. Narratively and structurally,  Hitman 3 strips its own make believe away, leaving the series’ core darkness on display."

Hitman 3 review for PC.Hitman 3 is the end of an era. After birthing the series in 2000 and becoming synonymous with it since, IO Interactive is letting Agent 47 kick up his feet and have some well-deserved time off from all the coordinated killing. But his looming retirement has not dulled his killer instinct as Hitman 3 is one of his best contracts in the past two decades.It achieves such highs by knowing when to utilize Hitman’s strengths, when to deviate from them, and when to mix them around. Hitman 3, in typical Hitman fashion, takes 47 to a handful of exotic locations around the world. These exquisitely rendered locales are immensely dense, lived-in areas full of different subsections that all intelligently weave in and around each other somewhat like a Soulslike game.IO has shown its mastery in that regard and it’s truly remarkable how the team can continually explore new territories while also maintaining such a high level of quality. For example, the old rural English mansion is wildly different from the gorgeous, neon-soaked streets of Chongqing and both even exhibit their depth in their own ways. The manor is stacked with multiple, detailed floors with its own smaller side areas while the Chongqing map is more about a few medium-sized facilities and how they link together.All of the maps find ways to express themselves differently both aesthetically and architecturally like this to great effect. Its array of unique atmospheres make Hitman 3 a pretty game that, like the protagonist himself, can take many distinct forms and its architecture gives 47 the playground he needs to do what he does best: murder without restraint. The targets in each mission can be shot, burned, stabbed, blown up, or crushed in an uncountable amount of ways and all rely on the player’s wit and exploration skills. Levels are brimming with ways to assassinate and that freedom is still unmatched, especially the satisfying special or accidental kills that are filled with IO’s signature dark humor.Jamming a ton of different toys and opportunities into each stage organically makes them so replayable, too. Whacking a target is then followed up by all the “what if” assassinations that could have been. Numerous challenges and unlocks extrinsically motivate players to experiment while the joy of finding and performing them is the intrinsic reward, both of which work together in harmony to make Hitman 3 almost endlessly replayable.While IO deserves credit for maintaining that level of quality, unparalleled openness, replayability, and detailed sandbox level design are carryovers from the last two games. IO instead chose to innovate in how it doles out assassinations. Only two of the six stages are more typical Hitman missions where 47 is dropped in an area with a couple of targets, meaning that the other four take that idea and mix it around. The best of these ideas, like the oft-discussed Knives Out-esque murder mystery, take the core of Hitman and cleverly put those mechanics in a different context. Meticulously searching around is inherent to Hitman so it’s only natural to use those same skills to solve a murder rather than commit one.Most of these unexpected wrinkles work out well, but a couple of them butt up against what Hitman stands for and suffer a bit because of it. Two of these changes are unexpectedly narrow, funneling a classically freeform series into something rather strict and comparatively less fulfilling. Serving the narrative has its positives and these sections are fine, but sacrificing such a core element of the series drags these parts down.Hitman 3 has more than enough classic Hitman to make up for these slight deviations, especially since it carries over the entirety of the prior two entries (if players have purchased them). This approach does limit what new things Hitman 3 can do, which is slightly disappointing. However, it also allows the game to live under one digital roof where all three games coalesce into one big (and thankfully, compressed) launcher. Sequels usually replace their predecessors but they all sit alongside one another here with the same profile level and all of the added UI touches and enhancements from the most recent installment. Hitman 3 is an inclusive and forward-thinking culmination of this great “World of Assassination” idea.The aforementioned limits mean Hitman 3 doesn’t have many big new features it can tout. Unlockable persistent shortcuts work with the game’s commitment to replayability and the new hacking camera has its uses (particularly during the murder mystery), but they are more small improvements over sequel-ready upgrades. Hitman 2 contained some meaningful changes — like working mirrors, a bigger stashing briefcase, and hiding in crowds — and Hitman 3 doesn’t offer a similar list of improvements. Virtual reality is admittedly new for the series, but that’s not something many people are going to experience as, on top of VR’s built-in niche appeal, it’s exclusive to the PS4 version (at least, for the time being).Hitman 3 does add to the narrative though. It doesn’t do a great job of catching players up to its dense yet brief story, but it continually raises the stakes and places Agent 47 and Diana Burnwood in some tense scenarios, adding even more motivation to each mission. IO cashes in on their long history together and finds an emotional core that carries the story along, which is ironic for such an emotionless protagonist like 47.Hitman 3’s story reflects IO’s time with the franchise as even skilled professionals must eventually move on and carve a new path for themselves. IO will be focusing its efforts elsewhere for the near future but it has at least left Hitman on a particularly high note. A suite of rich and highly detailed levels, open-ended mission design, and nearly endless replayability allow it to excel off its own merits, but easy access to the prior two entries makes Hitman 3 the ultimate Hitman experience that puts all of the trilogy’s successes under one poison-tipped umbrella. The bald, barcoded assassin has had many hits in his 21-year career, but even though it might be his last for quite some time, Hitman 3 is one of 47’s best executions yet.Game Revolution reviewed Hitman 3 on PC.

Hitman 3,Chris Carter,Destructoid,https://www.destructoid.com/stories/review-hitman-3-616703.phtml,"darkMan I’m glad that IO Interactive was able to bail from a potential destruction of their studio with a buyout. It was really touch and go there for a bit, but they did it, and Hitman (among a few other IPs) came along for the ride.It would have been a damn shame if Hitman 3 never came to fruition, because it feels like the culmination of everything the recent trilogy has achieved so far.Hitman 3 (PC [reviewed] PS4, PS5, Stadia, Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X)

Backstage access, elaborate mezzanines; this is a flashy stage and it wants you to know it at all times.It’s also very well paced. Those geographical restrictions I mentioned? They open up over time as you complete each playthrough of Dubai, but also help acclimate brand new players on a semi-guided, but definitely not linear first hunt. It also gives the rest of the game plenty of room to breathe going forward.IO Interactive was already good at this: but they’re getting better.Dartmoor, United KingdomDonning his best Sherlock cap (or Benoit Blanc/Hercule Poirot outfit), Agent 47 is whisked away to the dreary countryside of Dartmoor for a murder mystery affair. Egad!Once again, IO Interactive nails it here. They’ve gone directly from a bright and larger-than-life Dubai skyscraper to a down-to-earth, but still out-there concept. It goes to show you that the studio is not resting on their laurels, or saving the best for last. They’re willing to provide worthwhile scenarios at a regular pace, and Dartmoor is one of my favorites of the bunch.While I’m going to refrain from spoiling anything here (and there’s a lot to spoil), Dartmoor is easily one of the best cases for IO Interactive’s penchant for environmental storytelling. There’s so much to discover and glean here in this mansion journey, from the inner workings of familial lore to the tale of the house itself.I found myself going back to this one immediately after clearing it.Berlin, GermanyAt this point the stakes get a little higher, story-wise, and the tension is ramping up. It colors the significance of Berlin within the confines of the campaign.This one is a little more lawless. There’s multiple factions at play (security, agents, bikers, civilians) and they’re all kind of scrunched together to create a chaotic, more intimate map. And not every Hitman map needs to be bright! Even if those are among my favorites (Miami immediately comes to mind from Hitman 2 – something I played in Hitman 3 again actually, as the package allows you to select previously owned games).It’s probably the least flashy bit of Hitman 3, but again, the narrative significance of it adds to the heightened severity of it. It fits.Chongqing, ChinaAh, neon. Berlin had some, but not nearly enough. Chongqing fixes that.With the setup of “2.5 million cameras” watching your every move, Chongqing hits that theme fantasy right away of whisking you away to a unique land; but also comes in swinging with a variety of locations to explore that keep things fresh, even on that first run. A giant underground bunker is a classic Hitman fixture, housed below a semi-bustling city that has more than enough nuances to justify replays.It’s a keeper.Mendoza, ArgentinaAt this point the story is winding down, but it still isn’t completely in the way. Despite the enhanced focus on Agent 47 and the people who surround him, the objectives mostly remain the same. It’s a positive in my mind, because the formula still works best when it plays up its sandboxes first and foremost.I intimated the James Bond references earlier, but this is 47 at his most 007. Mendoza’s wine country is a classy affair, a far cry from the rainy streets of Chongqing, or even the shiny artifice of Mumbai. No, this is more of an idyllic, rural take: a level befitting of the penultimate stage.It might be a bit on the small side as far as substantial zones go, but it’s one of the most memorable, visually.Carpathian Mountains, RomaniaIt’s really hard to talk about this one without spoiling it (I’m sure someone will), but it’s enrobed in story bits and does feel like a proper trilogy finale. It’s also the most linear stage of the bunch, so just be ready for that.If you muck about in each map and take things slowly, you can allot about an hour a level to clear the game: so roughly six hours in all. But Hitman is predicated on replay value, and Hitman 3 nudges things even further down that path. Shortcuts are probably the biggest draw, which alter each sandbox to make them a little more accessible.Basically, if you lower a specially marked ladder or some other device, you can access that shortcut on future playthroughs. It’s very subtle; but it’s a welcome change as it ensures that you can explore the sandbox the way you want to each time. I would refrain from using the phrase “guided,” but the first run is definitely angled in such a way to make it feel more cinematic in nature. With shortcuts, branching paths allow you to see the entirety of the design in all its splendor. This is on top of the existing “starting locations” system, mind.Coupled with extra gadgets (some of which can be imported – though not as swimmingly on PC), Hitman 3 is really fun to dive back into; or introduce someone to for that matter, just to see what they come up with. It’s the little things that add up and really make Hitman 3 special.Hats off to IO Interactive for really sticking with this series and getting it right.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]SuperbA hallmark of excellence. There may be flaws, but they are negligible and won't cause massive damage.

Hitman 3,Dave Thier,Forbes,https://www.forbes.com/sites/games/2021/01/19/hitman-3-review-the-best-levels-in-the-series-and-one-of-the-worst/,"Hitman 3You could go ahead and call it Hitman 2.5 if you want. Hitman 3 is less of a full new idea, more of a continuation, expansion and refinement of the ideas present in Hitman 2. But then, you run into another problem with nomenclature, which is that Hitman 2 was already basically Hitman 1.5, a continuation, expansion, and refinement of Hitman. So if we’re going by decimals, that would make Hitman 3 into Hitman 2, I guess? Hitman 1.75, perhaps, asymptotically approaching something like a numbered sequel. Of course, it’s all nonsense: this was always only ever one game, released in 3 parts over 4 years: Hitman: World of Assassination.Thankfully, it is one of the best games ever made.Fans of the series—or the game, if we’re going to stick with that—will be right at home from the first moments of Hitman 3. Despite all the plot machinations ticking behind the curtain, the opening level is as familiar as the Paris level from back in 2016. We are set to infiltrate a fancy party at the top of the world, a Dubai skyscraper the inside of which lowly peasants will only ever see if they are working there, or, in particular but hardly unique circumstances, trying to kill someone there. We have two targets: one that mills around in plain view, inviting poison and accidents, and one that sits above in a secure location, requiring tricky stealth or elaborate disguises to access.From there, we play, donning and shedding disguises at will, moving through this lethal version of Upstairs/Downstairs as we engineer poetic accidents or outright brutality to bring our targets down. We play and play again, this time engineering our targets into the same room to be killed at once, this other time pretending to be a new bodyguard to get one of them alone, or a chef with access to lethal poison and an accelerated egg timer. Repetition is the name of the game, turning this playground of unhappy accidents and class conflict inside and out until you can play it blindfolded. A nice little addition this time around is shortcuts: persistent ladders and the like you can unlock in one playthrough and use in the next, opening the door to more efficient sneaking every time.This is the basic formula of this game, one that remains essentially untouched until the last level, but not without interesting experimentation. One such moment comes in the next level, offering a one target, more constrained experience with a singular, involved “mission story” that’s clearly meant to dominate your first playthrough. It’s a Knives Out-style murder mystery where you play the detective (so long as you knock him out and take his clothes as he stops to catch his breath in front of the conveniently-placed, totally unobserved closet). You spend your time talking to each family member in turn and gathering clues before presenting your finding to the target, who will celebrate your success by...taking an unguarded break on a third-floor balcony.Hitman 3From there, it’s back to experimentation. The detective might be the star, but the undertaker and photographer can get up to some shenanigans as well.The standout here is undoubtedly the level “Apex Predator”, featuring not only one of the game’s best environments in the form of an underground Berlin rave but its best setup, as well. Instead of 1-3 targets there are 10, all of them blended in with the crowd, hunting 47. He turns the tables on them, listening into their conversations to eliminate each in turn with a little more improvisation than those other levels, taking out 5 before their handler calls the operation off. There is room for near-infinite experimentation with none of the formula in some of the other levels: taking out one target might be as simple as distracting his friend before shoving him over the railing, or maybe the classic “broken extension cord in a puddle” trick. I threw a sniper of the roof before making handy use of the weapon he left behind: it goes on. And, as always, you can always engineer every target into the same location at once, though this time they’re ready for you.That’s three levels: there are only 6 here, which might seem slim if you haven’t played the game before and don’t know just how deep these go. Two more are straightforward: a gorgeous, rain-drenched neon noir with a touch of Cyberpunk, the other a fancy party at a vineyard, as traditional and expansive as a Hitman level can be. Would you like to electrocute an aristocrat in a huge puddle of his own spilled wine? Nah, I’d rather crush him along with the year’s harvest. 47 is dead serious, whether he’s wearing a tailored suit or a chicken costume, but the game deploys humor better than nearly any other AAA title.It’s the last level where the game stumbles, and it points out the biggest weakness along the way: this game is meant to be the conclusion to the convoluted story of the previous two games, and that means that there is, necessarily, a lot more story poking its way into these levels. I have never been interested in this and I’m still not, and it can’t be ignored in the last level, which is literally a train, forcing you from one car to the next as you get to to the single, inevitable end. It even allows you to kill enemies besides the target, anathema to the series as it stands.The game falls prey to this particular problem again in an earlier level, where no matter how you go about it it always ends in a specific, scripted manhunt. Hitman can abide scripting, but only so much. I get it: the developers had an idea, and executed it fine. It’s just that the idea runs counter to what makes the game great.So it’s 5 levels really, but they are excellent levels, masterful executions of a brilliant concept by a team at the top of their game. And, on top of that, we’ve already got the other two games—which are available for dirt cheap, now—to make a single, expansive, globetrotting experience that sees our familiar, baldheaded puppetmaster accessing the world’s ultra-wealthy just when they thought they were invincible, dancing through the class divides like the nameless angel of death that he is, and then blowing someone up with an exploding golf ball or something.If I were reviewing Hitman: World of Assassination (a game which does not yet exist but will almost certainly be released by this time next year), I would give it a 10: more than the sum of its parts, a triumph of world-building and design unlike anything else in the industry. But it’s just Hitman 3, and so I’ve got to dock it for allowing its convoluted story to interfere with what it does best.I do not think it is a spoiler to say that the game ends with 47 triumphant, ready to continue assassinating wealthy monsters with none of the baggage of the story so far. Which is all I’ve ever wanted to do. I hope that either the upcoming James Bond game channels this energy, or that IO continues making more Hitman either concurrently or afterwards, because I will never have enough.IO provided a review code for the Xbox version of this game."
Hitman 3,Bill Lavoy,Shacknews,https://www.shacknews.com/article/122265/hitman-3-review-one-for-the-road,"New to Shacknews? Signup for a Free AccountAlready have an account? Login NowAgent 47 returns to complete the World of Assassination trilogy in Hitman 3.When IO Interactive rebooted the Hitman series in 2016 they kicked off what could be considered a golden age for the franchise. After the linear approach to Hitman: Absolution in 2012, the 2016 iteration featured open levels that rewarded players for creative approaches to eliminating targets. Each level was packed with interesting NPCs and side stories, and the developer continuously pumped fresh content into the experience to ensure players were never bored. This continued all the way through 2020 and the complete life cycle of 2018’s Hitman 2.With Hitman 3, IO Interactive is looking to close out the World of Assassination trilogy that began in 2016 and wrap up the story of Agent 47, Diana, Lucas Grey, and their fight against Providence, a powerful organization playing puppet master with the rest of the world. The same open design has returned, but there is a heavier focus on storytelling than the previous two games. This, along with the inclusion of the camera, permanent shortcuts, and new weapons and gadgets, keeps the experience fresh without losing sight of what the series has become.Hitman 3 kicks off with Agent 47 visiting Dubai and the world’s tallest building to eliminate two targets associated with Providence. Right away, the game starts to showcase the new features, gently guiding the player to make use of the camera, as well as having Agent 47 interact with a keypad. Both features are new to the World of Assassination trilogy, as are permanent shortcuts. These are instances where Agent 47 can open a door or drop a ladder that he can access in future runs to get where he needs to go faster or create more unique assassination opportunities. In the case of Dubai, I was able to drop two ladders that allowed me to get a four-minute Silent Assassin, Suit Only run when replaying the level. The high of studying my target's routines and working out the timing paid off after I made use of the new ICA Remote Micro Taser, dropping it in a pool of water and setting it off when my target walked through.I was able to do the same thing with permanent shortcuts in Hitman 3’s second location, Dartmoor. Dartmoor is a top-three destination for me across the entire trilogy and comes complete with its own murder mystery that had me so captivated I pushed killing my target to the back burner. I could have killed her a dozen times and didn’t bother. I had more important matters at hand. In fact, by the time I was ready to off the nasty old lady that Diana put in my crosshairs, her bodyguards were all sawing logs in bins around the level and she was wandering about completely unguarded. I’m shocked she didn’t die of old age based on how long it took me to finish the job.The Hitman 3 base game comes with six main missions with cinematics sprinkled between them to tell the story IO Interactive has cooked up. This is no different from the previous two games, but players can expect to be a bit restricted on their first runs, as loadouts are frequently disabled to allow the story to properly unfold. The good news is, this is only an issue on a first playthrough, as loadout slots, unique starting points, and smuggling opportunities are all back and available after a first completion.The progression system is largely unchanged but has been tweaked a little. Completing challenges within a level will award points towards a destination’s mastery. Each mastery level achieved will provide some type of unlock, be it a smuggle point, unique starting location, or weapons and gadgets. Missing from Hitman 3 is a one-sheet that shows players everything they haven’t unlocked and how to obtain it, but the classic challenges are more streamlined than previous games and should make unlocking some cool gear a little more straightforward. The post-mission screen will also give players a playstyle rating, which is a unique title the game assigns based on the actions taken in the previous mission.Once I’d worked my way through each mission to complete the Hitman 3 story — a task that players can expect to take less than 10 hours — I returned to each location to finish mission stories, challenges, and mastery levels of each destination for the weapon and gear unlocks. This is where the game opens up and really begins to shine, which is true about Hitman (2016) and Hitman 2 as well. Nothing beats playing through each of the opportunities and spending time mastering each level to create new ways to kill each target, or finding a disguise that let’s Agent 47 walk around like he owns the place. However, I preferred doing this in the two previous games, as there are levels — plural — in Hitman 3 where Agent 47 must retrieve something in addition to killing his targets, and another mission that is somewhat linear. There’s a mentality in me as a player that once I eliminate my targets it’s time to GTFO, and that isn’t always possible here. It’s not unlike Sapienza from Hitman (2016) in that some of the creativity of killing targets is lost when you must detour to a different part of the map to pick up a piece of paper.While I enjoyed every level of Hitman 3 on my initial playthrough and some on subsequent runs, my review copy of Hitman 3 included Hitman (2016) and Hitman 2. I found myself wanting to go back and play those levels as much as I did the new ones, and I think Hitman 3 could miss its mark with players who don’t own the previous two titles. Part of what has made the franchise such a win for me over the last four years is being able to use all my unlocks on any level across two games. Anyone who buys only Hitman 3 will have six destinations and far less gizmos and gadgets to call on, and I think the overall experience could end up lacking for those that don’t own the full package.Visually, Hitman 3 and all its destinations look amazing. My copy was for PC and I was able to crank every graphical setting and maintain more than 100 frames per second with a 2560x1440 (2K) resolution. I was able to take advantage of the gorgeous graphics thanks to the PC version having NVIDIA Ansel support, allowing players to take in-game HUD-less screen shots without a built-in photo mode. Hitman 3 also features several graphical enhancements, including ray tracing and improved lighting, which was especially easy to spot under the neon lights of the Chongqing destination.Complementing incredible visuals is the stellar sound design, whether it’s an NPC conversation or environmental sounds. The acting for both Diana and Agent 47 is masterfully done, as it is with many of the targets and NPCs throughout the experience. The best part of the sound, though, is often the music that captures the mood of a certain level, or the humorous dialog between two NPCs. Players will have hours of fun just listening in on random conversations throughout each of the levels, and there is always a feeling that each location is alive with everything that can be heard at any given time. Stand in the middle of the crowd in Dubai and just listen to how cool it all sounds.While I enjoyed the conclusion to the World of Assassination trilogy’s narrative, the best that Hitman 3 has to offer is when it sets players loose in its levels to be creative and explore. Nothing beats the process of plotting out a potential route, working out the various pieces by saving and loading repeatedly, then finally putting it all together in that perfect run. That’s still there in Hitman 3 as it was previously, but each time a mission asked me to retrieve something it felt like a chore after my first run. Still, it offers players a huge amount of content if they don’t expect to experience it all on a single run. It’s a game that’s meant to be played repeatedly, and it benefits from the addition of the camera and the permanent shortcuts. It’s great on its own, but combined with Hitman (2016) and Hitman 2 it helps make up the masterpiece that is the World of Assassination trilogy.This review is based on a PC review copy provided by the publisher.

					Bill Lavoy posted a new article, Hitman 3 review: One for the road 
					Good review, Wonder what hardware he was using to get 100fps at 1440p?  Anyways, I went head and bought it on Epic after epic promised to find a way to bring Hitman 2 levels to Hitman 3. Speculation is WB Games is the legal roadblock. Back to the game, the story has never been the draw for me in Hitman games. It was fine, very serviceable but I don't care for 47s back story enough to get involved. I would be fine never knowing 47s back story.  Keeping it a mystery. However since its going to be the last Hitman game for  a long while, guess they had to finish that up.				
					i7-9700 CPU @ 3.6GHz, 2080 Ti, 32 GB RAM. Those are the big ones I assume you're looking for. Oh, and I have it installed on an SSD dedicated to only PC games. The cool thing about the story is that you can take 20 minutes and just play the cinematic bits from all three games right within the game. But, the draw here is the open levels and all the different ways to approach them. You will love Dartmoor.				
					Can you save anywhere at any time? 				
					If you are playing on Master, you get one save per mission. If you are playing on Professional (default) or Casual, you get as many as you want. They encourage you to use them to work out routes, etc.				
					Thank you! 				
					I'm working on lots of guide content for this game which will live mostly on our YT channel. I always encourage folks to play it once blind, but there's lots of help to come up with some fresh ideas.				
					Sweet, I'll definitly keep a lookout for all thatI've never played a Hitman game				
					Hmmm, if I hate Stealth, should I still not bother with this game?				
					I think of them more like a puzzle game than a stealth game honestly. Not saying you don't sneak, but that's just part of it. Other times you're just dressed up in a bird suit walking right in front of people before you brain somebody with a brick or something. There's lots of ways to play it.				
					Ok thanks! I'll keep my eye on it then for a sale 				
					You can probably get Hitman 1 or 2 for dirt cheap if you want a taste.				
					Or if you've been getting the free Epic Store games I think it was one of them.				
					Yeah, the first game was free at some point.				
					Worth noting though that progress from 1 doesn't carry forward. Progress from 2 does and you can play all the content of 1 in 2 and 3.				
					You can get the first level free for Hitman 2 on Steam. It’s not a great introduction map though, it just throws you into the mechanics, but it’s a very simple map compared to all the others in terms of complications and crowds.				
					You don't have to go fully stealth				
					it's very easy if you go guns blazing. find an auto gun, find a chokepoint and just start shooting. clear out all the baddies then clear out the target. but that's boring. 				
					Honestly, there are some players that are so good they don't really spend a lot of time in stealth. This game is great for trick kills and speed runs. But when you start out and are figuring things out, there will be moments of stealth and waiting around for sure.				
					The game is less about sneaking than it is finding an outfit that allows you to walk casually through restricted areas.				
					""Oh, uh, just trying to find the bathroom officer! No problem here!""				
					I only played the original, which IIRC meant sneaking to take out someone who's wearing the right outfit, so you can then find another person with a different outfit, and so forth.				
					I'm not the biggest fan of stealth in games but Hitman is just a real fun time...				
					Splinter Cell Blacklist is what you seek  				
					Probably not. Folks are saying it’s not about “stealth” but it’s very much a game of patient observation, watching and waiting guard patterns, etc. So while the actual execution is more of a puzzle game and isn’t just hide behind a wall, shoot a guy with a silencer, rinse/repeat, if the thing you don’t like about stealth games is the general pacing and needing to retry whenever you break stealth and die you’ll probably be frustrated.  That said, the games are great and as suggested elsewhere the recent games are also great and could be a cheaper way to give it a try. 				
					I want to start playing the all on the series x. Does anybody know or have the pricing on how much the hitman 1 and 2 game passes will be? My google-fu has failed me. Were you able to see the pricing during your review playtime Bill?				
					If you buy the game on EGS right now I think you get all three games because of the snafu of bringing them over. You've got like 10 days.				
					Nice review. How did you feel about the upgraded engine for 1 and 2 content?				
					I noticed specifically the climbing animation was better and the lighting was better across the board.				
					[deleted]				
					Don't forget to link your accounts at https://www.ioi.dk/ioi-account/  First you need to create an IOI account.  Then log out.  Then link it to your steam account by logging in with that.  Log out again.  Log back in with your epic account, then log back into your IOI account.  0_o				
					Also is it normal not to get an activation key less than 12 hours till relase? 
					I thought the account linking thing wasn't even up yet? The page they put out said it would be up soon but wasn't ready.				
					Unless it's specific to something else, I linked my Steam and Epic account to my just created IOI account like I thought they meant ¯\_(ツ)_/¯				
					Ah yeah, probably a good idea. I'm guessing you need to do that and then use that site whenever it's there to actually trigger the transfer. I'll do that tonight.				"
Hitman 3,Alex Donaldson,VG247,https://www.vg247.com/2021/01/19/hitman-3-review/,"It's not the most friendly game for newcomers, but Hitman 3 is a great finale to one of gaming's best trilogies. The best moments in the Hitman series are always right before the kill. If you’ve played these games, you know the feeling - when, after much preparation, players find themselves face-to-face with their target. Instantly, they’re given a paralyzing choice - stick to the plan and the obvious path laid out by the narrative, or improvise for a quick, efficient kill?In a sense, I imagine the creation of Hitman 3 provided a similar quandary for developer IO Interactive. The easy, simple thing to do would’ve been to just stick to the plan and do more of the same, which is arguably what the excellent Hitman 2 did. But this third entry isn’t quite like that; it spies opportunity and peels off in a few interesting new directions along the way - just as the player might snatch an entirely unplanned kill half an hour into the mission.IO wanted to focus more on the story this time around, and that brings with it a naturally more in-depth and occasionally more directed experience. The intricate, clockwork level designs that players can master the mechanisms of are still there - but the first time you run through them plainly marked intel and the handler’s guiding voice are more present, aiming to make this feel more like an epic story rather than a silly sandbox. It works.The silly sandbox stuff is still there; Hitman takes great glee in its dark humor, be that in 47’s deadpan dialogue or in costumes he can don and weapons he can use - but between and during missions, the narrative runs more fluidly. Where before it felt like more of a wrapper, now it feels deeply baked into Hitman 3’s identity. For the first time in this trilogy, the overarching story beyond the little tales in each individual level gripped me. I consider that a big win.I want to keep this review as spoiler-free as possible, but given that many people will be coming to this game with a knowledge of the previous two, I want to contextualize what I mean in talking about IO taking a different path. So let me vaguely summarize the game’s content, without getting into any specific story spoilers. 
 
Hitman 3 has six locations, just as the previous two games. I would say that two of those six are entirely traditional World of Assassination trilogy levels, following the template set by previous games closely. Two more are also traditional, but in the later stages of the mission pivot into more heavily narratively-focused events, the sandbox giving way to more directed, absolute objectives once certain milestones are reached. One is a wild twist on the basics of the series - more on this in a moment. The remaining mission is a more linear level, albeit with player agency and choice in how you approach it.What you see in this structure is confidence. Like I said, each level is still built as a playground, as each is still designed to be home to alternative game modes that play on the emergent, AI-driven nature of Hitman’s locales. But each story mission and its core objectives feels more distinct than in previous games.Dartmoor is one of the more traditional levels, but it still shows IO’s ambition this third time out. The level’s core opportunity sees Agent 47 take the identity of a private eye, summoned by 47’s target to investigate a murder on her private English country estate. 47 can use the murder investigation simply to get closer to her, guessing the perpetrator or framing an innocent. He can also properly solve the crime, scouring the estate looking for clues and interviewing suspects. Alternatively, of course, you can ignore this storyline and find another way to complete the hit. The choice is yours, but as in most levels the game keenly tries to nudge you towards this impressive slice of open-ended storytelling. It’s a slice that deserves to be experienced. Dartmoor is the greatest single-level story IO has ever told, incidentally - though as a sandbox it’s also unlikely to topple Sapienza, the perfect second level of the 2016 game. 
 
One less traditional level is exciting because of how it doesn’t obey Hitman’s traditional rules. Usually you enter a mission after a briefing all about a high-profile client - but in one mission, you don’t know who your targets are. Instead, it’s a deadly game of cat-and-mouse between 47 and rival assassins - each trying to uncover and kill the other first. This takes place in a vast level, packed with bystanders - and any one of them could be one of the assassins. This almost feels like a love letter to the most hardcore of fans, stripping the game down to its most basic elements - which cannily matches 47’s status at the time.I know some elements of this will inevitably get a mixed reception from fans. The most linear level, in particular, is likely to get some flak. But, honestly, I don’t mind. That mission is built the way it is as a direct result of the way Hitman 3's story is structured. The level is designed to be a more simplistic sort of catharsis. At that it is successful. Further, Hitman 3 is the conclusion of a trilogy that already provides a raft of excellent sandboxes for players to experience - and of course, those levels can carry forward to live ‘inside’ the Hitman 3 package, should you own previous games. That last point will be useful for newcomers, too, since some elements of Hitman 3’s story will be relatively indecipherable without at least a passing knowledge of its predecessors. The same tutorial level from the previous two entries is available here, but beyond that, you're thrown in at the deep end.What hasn’t really changed, obviously, are the core mechanics. This is the best-looking entry, and there are small quality-of-life improvements, but generally everything performs as it did in the previous two games - which pretty well nailed the things that matter.Taken individually, Hitman 3 feels like great value, with plenty of variety and lots to do. When taken as a whole, the World of Assassination trilogy is hands-down one of the best and most complete-feeling trilogies in video game history. It’s a fitting finale for 47 - at least for now - and it has naturally left me thrilled to see what IO does with James Bond or whatever else comes next. It might only be January - but I can pretty much guarantee this will end the year as one of my 2021 favourites.Version tested: PC [Specs]. A copy of the game was provided by the publisher.

Three years ago, IO Interactive still had compelling directions to take its level design and plot composition, and the resulting sequel doubled down on dark humor and inherent video game silliness—while also getting a better handle on how to compose its levels. Walking through crowded scenes as a slow, blend-in-the-scenes assassin, looking for clues and opportunities, simply felt better in Hitman 2.This week, Hitman III arrives on consoles, PCs, and streaming platforms with five new arenas of mayhem—the fewest yet in a numbered entry—and a pesky list of new tweaks. It feels very, very familiar—even more than the leap from 2016's Hitman to 2018's Hitman 2. It lands in a nearly identical interface as the last game, with the same XP progression meters, the same objective-based system, the same one-off ""escalation"" missions, and the same ""custom contracts"" sandbox. And its graphics engine revolves around a seemingly identical core, with one admittedly handsome tweak.The worst part about Hitman III, then, is the number in the title. It betrays the game's true nature as an expansion pack instead of a standalone game that can easily be enjoyed in isolation. That's not a bad thing! If all you want are ""more Hitman reboot levels that are up to the series' par of excellence"" (and that was the game's original ""episodic"" plan), then III will neatly lodge into your brain. IO Interactive has concluded the ""World of Assassination"" trilogy in mostly fine fashion, although its inability to live up to the heights of Hitman 2 led me to immediately wish this were a more ambitious sequel.

If you're new to the series, however, your path is clearer: set up a sale alert on Hitman 2, if not a package that combines Hitman 1's and 2's levels in the same package. They're great, and you have zero reason to skip them on your way to Hitman III.This week's sequel drives the point home by inviting new players to play the 5-year-old tutorial from Hitman 1. This teaches you to sneak onto a boat and silently kill a target. Along the way, lure guards into isolation; knock them out and steal their outfits; use their attire to blend in to otherwise inaccessible clearance zones; then pick up keys, access cards, and implements of death as you slither toward your target, seeking to avoid a firefight.Once you finish training, go back to the same mission, with a guide pointing you to other paths toward the same target. You'll rack up more experience points doing this, and these unlock mission-specific perks (new starting points, new places to hide weapons and gizmos within the map) and series-wide weapons and cosmetics.The fact that this dated tutorial applies so well to Hitman III says a lot—that's some serious ""ain't broke, don't fix it"" energy—though the new game does include two new tweaks. The first is a ""shortcut unlock"" feature, which should immediately comfort series fans.Hitman III's versions on Stadia and Nintendo Switch have something in common: they both stream from a server. We've seen a few Switch games experiment with this model, so be ready to connect to a streaming server before taking this version's dive.Your repeat visits to levels to uncover new ways to kill your primary targets or fulfill objectives are sometimes sped up when you unlock a new shortcut starting point, but you may still find yourself marching the full length of the level to find and complete certain objectives. This year, clearly marked yellow doors can be seen in every new level, and you can unlock them from the inside of buildings. Meaning, after you snake your way through, say, a biker hideout in your first playthrough, you can permanently jimmy open the bikers' barricaded front door to reduce the tedium whenever you return. IO Interactive takes care to place these rarely and deliberately, and they're a great tweak.The other new system is a smartphone camera, which doubles as a scan-and-hack tool for, say, turning on a TV or blacking out a security window. You have to use this in the very first mission to open the very first closed access point... and then the camera is put away for much of the game. This isn't something like Metroid Prime, where you're expected to constantly scan the environment looking for clues and analysis. Instead, it only gets used in moments clearly marked by the game, like when a voice in your ear recommends you scan a specific, colored logo to open a door or when a questgiver asks you to take a photo of a secondary target once you've knocked them out.The camera includes a 4x zoom for the sake of examining the world when you're short a sniper rifle, and that's a welcome boon, but I'd hoped for more camera-based fun and trickery than this sequel offers. Plus, Agent 47 is never penalized when he's seen taking photos in heavily guarded zones, particularly one high-security lab in the game's China level. Pull out a pistol, and you'll be shot down; take dozens of photos that somehow magically open and close doors, and it's no big deal. Talk about an odd disconnect.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

Hitman 3,Chris White,God is a Geek,https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/hitman-3-review/,"January 20, 2021You know exactly what you’re getting with Hitman, but that familiarity is what makes the series so replayable and enjoyable. Every level is meticulously crafted to allow for multiple methods to get the job done, with locations so vivid and alive you’re left awestruck exploring every inch of them. In many ways, Hitman 3 is no different.  IO Interactive‘s World of Assassination trilogy has been a superb ride, and with the final stop in Agent 47‘s journey finally here, I can tell you with all certainty that it doesn’t disappoint. Some levels are better than others, but overall it has some of the best settings to date.It’s finally time to eliminate the shady organisation known as Providence, and with the help of long-lost friend Lucas Grey and ICA handler Diana Burnwood, you’re tasked with putting an end to their powerful global rule. There are some major twists and turns, but it never does anything to elevate Agent 47 to anything other than the cold and calculated assassin we all know and love. I was hoping for some revelations about who the man is, or at least some detail on the character beyond the obvious. Going into Hitman 3, I struggled to remember any of the narrative from the previous two entries, but in all honesty, that’s not why I play them.Much of the gameplay remains the same, but there’s a new tool at your disposal that helps with hacking doors, windows, and keypads. You cannot use the camera with every locked entrance, but Lucas Grey talks you through particular areas and lets you know when it can be used. Movement is fluid enough and staying in the shadows feels easy enough to do. If anything, stealth has been refined, but it’s seldom been an issue in the entirety of the trilogy.The first level takes place in a huge skyscraper in Dubai, and it was within minutes that I fell deeply in love with Hitman 3. The bright sun shone through the golden chambers of the building, majestic pillars stood tall, and immaculate marble flooring lay at my feet, and hundreds of people from all walks of life passed me by, all unaware of what I was doing there. As with every Hitman game so far, I explored the area and waited until an opportunity arose to find my targets. It didn’t take long to find one, and from there I pursued one which led me straight to my mark. There are the mission objectives available to you which give you a foot in the door, or you can simply find your own way.The first time I played the mission, I took one of the targets out on the roof after he invited me to be his personal guard. There, he wanted to see how well I could hit some moving targets with a knife. On the secluded area of the rooftop, I lodged one of the blades in his throat, then kicked him off the building. The second target was a bit trickier. I arranged a meeting with him, where he wanted me to kill someone who’d been a thorn in his side. Once I’d taken the new target out, I returned to the room and gained his trust, then escaped to his private quarters with him and managed to put a bullet in his head.On my second playthrough, I did things completely differently. After using the new camera feature to hack open the electronic windows, I scaled the building and found the computer systems where I scheduled a meeting between the two targets. I took out a guard and dressed in his outfit, then joined the meeting as everyone else but the two targets were left the room. I activated the security for the room and shut it down, leaving me with the perfect opportunity to kill them both and leave the building without anyone suspecting a thing.This is why I love Hitman 3. You can play it exactly how you want to. There’s a multitude of ways to kill your targets, distract guards, gain the trust of unsuspecting NPCs, or just have some fun. I dressed as a drug dealer and supplied pills to technicians, disguised myself as a chef and slipped poison into someone’s food, took a photo of someone and electrocuted them in the process, pushed a guard off a moving train, deejayed at a German club, threw an apricot at a maid, and squashed someone with a mechanical grape press. There are tons of outcomes and plenty of choices to make, with endless possibilities and playthroughs that make Hitman 3 an absolute hoot.Of all the levels in Hitman 3, Dartmoor stands out as the best. It manages to encapsulate every element of gameplay so perfectly. Sneaking around the mansion, taking out your target with a range of smart and creative ways, using the wide range of opportunities to distract NPCs, and using your brains to solve an intricate puzzle. On top of all that, the layout of the grounds and the mansion are crafted superbly. Berlin isn’t quite as fun to play. It’s much harder to take out your targets as you’re walking around a huge nightclub with tons of people scattered around everywhere. It’s also a fairly bland environment, especially when compared to the grandeur of Dubai and Chongqing.In a series that requires precision, patience, and careful planning, Hitman 3 breaks the mould slightly as it approaches the end. Of course, you can still attempt to achieve the ‘Silent Assassin’ rank, but it’s much more fun to use the variety of guns that are available. It gives us an insight into what IO might do with the James Bond franchise, as much of the combat is precise, constricted, and full of style. It feels more ambitious than Hitman and Hitman 2. Yes, there’s little difference in gameplay, but the levels and ideas at play make Hitman 3 the best so far.Hitman 3 is a satisfying farewell to the world’s most famous assassin. The locations offer intelligent opportunities to take out your target, with plenty of replayability and moments of humour along the way. Berlin may not be the best of levels, but that’s only because the others are so exceptional, and thanks to the Mastery Ranks, you can replay every one over and over again to see how each mission objective plays out. There are tons of ways to gain XP, and completing the varying challenges gives you even more reason to play each level more than once. The visuals are stunning, the gameplay is smooth as silk, and although the story does nothing different to the everyday spy novel, you’ll still find plenty to enjoy.Superb level design
Tons of replayability
Plenty of opportunities to assassinateBerlin is the weakest level
Story is rather genericHitman 3 is a satisfying farewell to Agent 47, with stunning locations, and endless opportunities to take out your targets. Your home for all your videogame needs. Reviews, videos, podcast, news: we’ve got the lot: PS5, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, PS4, Xbox, PC Gaming!"
Hitman 3,Diego Perez,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/hitman-3-review/,"The Hitman World of Assassination trilogy has had a rocky rollout, to say the least. The series has swapped publishers with every entry, and each game has experimented with different release schedules, pricing strategies, DLC plans, and additional game modes. It just felt like every recent Hitman game was surrounded by some sort of behind the scenes drama, which is a shame considering the quality of the previous two releases. Now that the dust has settled and the entire trilogy is out, it’s much easier to admire Hitman for what it is. Hitman 3 marks the end of the World of Assassination trilogy, and now that the entire trilogy is complete, it’s not just the best game in the series, but one of the best stealth games ever made.That’s a lofty claim, but Hitman 3 is deserving of the title. In order to better explain myself, however, I need to talk about Hitman 3’s overall place in the trilogy. While this is a review of Hitman 3, it’s also a review of the World of Assassination trilogy as a whole. The entire trilogy can be played within Hitman 3, complete with all of the enhancements that come with it. Everything is arranged in a nice and neat timeline layout on the main menu, and progression and unlocks carry over and can be used in any location from any of the three games. Hitman 3 is a remarkable game on its own, but when treated as the final piece of the puzzle that is the World of Assassination trilogy, it’s just one third of an excellent package.Before discussing the overall package further, we should take a look at Hitman 3 itself first. There are six new levels, five of which are massive fully-featured destinations packed with secrets to uncover. The sixth and final level is disappointingly linear, but it’s still enjoyable. You may get worried when you hear the game only has six levels, but Hitman 3’s level list is deceptively small. Each location is begging to be explored and replayed more so than any other missions in any other game. Each level is a sandbox that you won’t see the bottom of for roughly ten hours or so. Every action has a reaction. No matter where you decide to throw a wrench into things, the game will react accordingly.Hitman 3 is a triumph of level design. To play a level only once is to do the game (and yourself) a huge disservice. The true genius of Hitman only shows when you attempt the nearly endless list of optional challenges. You may want to stick to one favorite strategy, but Hitman thrives when it pulls you out of your comfort zone. The optional challenges should not be likened to a checklist of achievements, but rather to side quests in an RPG. If you ignore them in an attempt to reach the credits as quickly as you can, you’ll miss out on some of the most engaging content the game has to offer.If you’re just looking for a game to blast through in a few hours, then your time will be better spent elsewhere. Hitman rewards those who invest time in it, and you get out what you put in. Thankfully, the game’s many challenges guide you toward interesting content and situations so you’re not just aimlessly wandering around the same levels waiting for something cool to happen. Escalation challenges make you play by stricter rules, forcing you to get creative as the difficulty ramps up from challenge to challenge. Series mainstay challenges like Sniper Assassin and Suit Only demand a different approach and, in turn, show you sides of a level’s dynamic sandbox that you never would have seen otherwise. Throughout several runs of a level, you become intimately familiar with its layout and characters, gaining a better understanding of how the cogs of the tightly-designed machine operate.While the previous two Hitman games had some levels that were pretty hit or miss, Hitman 3 is comprised of back to back highlights. The opening level set in a towering skyscraper in Dubai brings unprecedented verticality to the series, containing a packed party on the starting floor and a heavily guarded penthouse above, and things never slow down from there. Because the story ramps up so heavily in the third game, Hitman 3’s missions are more than straightforward hits, and objectives are more varied than ever before. From solving a murder mystery in an English home in the countryside to surviving a deadly game of cat and mouse in Berlin, there’s no shortage of variety. Each location is a visual spectacle as well, especially the neon-drenched alleyways of Chongqing. This is easily the greatest set of levels to ever grace the series.The story has never been the focus of the Hitman series, but Hitman 3 tells an okay tale that has some satisfying payoffs for those who have actually been following the World of Assassination plotline. The still image cutscenes from Hitman 2 are gone, and there is a much greater emphasis on Agent 47 and the supporting cast this time around. Some missions have special introductory sequences that serve as setpiece moments, but they can be skipped by choosing an alternate starting location upon repeat playthroughs. Story beats are no longer contained to cutscenes in between missions, and everything feels a bit less disjointed as a result.  The story won’t blow you away, but it does a nice job of wrapping up the trilogy and adds a sense of urgency and coherence to what would otherwise be a series of unconnected hits.The only real drawback of Hitman 3 is also its greatest strength: it’s just more Hitman. IO Interactive created a very strong foundation with the 2016 reboot, and Hitman 3 is essentially just a new pack of levels for the same game with some minor upgrades. If you didn’t like the first two games, then Hitman 3 won’t do anything to draw you in. If you liked the first two games, however, then there’s much more content ready for you to dive into. Still, even if you bounced off the first two games for whatever reason, now is the best time to give the series another shot because you can play all of the old levels within Hitman 3 and it’s much easier to get drawn into the narrative and the game’s shadowy underworld now that the entire trilogy’s story can be played continuously. This is definitely a series that takes a while to click for someone who’s not used to replaying levels and chasing perfect rankings, but once everything falls into place, it’s a hard game to put down.If you’re already a fan of the franchise, then there is a ridiculous amount of content here. With roughly 20 levels in the entire trilogy, you could easily spend over a hundred hours learning the ins and outs of every location. Even if you’re new to the series and are just starting out with Hitman 3, there’s more than enough content in this game to keep you busy for a while, and the first two games are regularly offered at steep discounts if you’re looking to expand your level library. Hitman 3 is already a deep game on its own, but when you factor in the first two games and the addition of VR support on PlayStation consoles, the amount of content is staggering.Hitman 3 is the ultimate murder simulator. Now that the World of Assassination trilogy is finally complete, there’s no excuse to not play Hitman. In order to truly appreciate the game’s intricacies, you have to commit to replaying levels, attempting challenges, and testing out new strategies. However, if you put in the time, you’ll be treated to one of the most engaging and rewarding stealth experiences in all of gaming.

Hitman 3,Josh Wise,VideoGamer,http://www.videogamer.com//reviews/hitman-iii-review," Posted in Reviews
If you wanted to find Agent 47, the hero of the Hitman series, where would you look? Time was, you would stoop to the low places. The back alleys of Saint Petersburg, say, burdened with dirty snow. Or a Romanian abattoir that doubled as a fetish club, with blood smeared across the walls and meat hooks dangling above the dancefloor. Nowadays, 47’s exploits are lighter, gilded with glamour, and you have a far better chance of locating him, at any given moment, by looking up. At the start of Hitman III, in a mission entitled “On Top of the World,” we see him in Dubai, at the summit of the fictional Burj Al-Ghazali (a stand-in for the Burj Khalifa, the Earth’s tallest building—which once acted alongside Tom Cruise, in Mission: Impossible—Ghost Protocol, and came up short). 47 is to drop in, mingle, sample the canapés, pull off a couple of slayings, and parachute to safety. If he can avoid bumping into Roger Moore on the way down, swaying smugly beneath a Union Jack, much the better.It’s no secret that the developer, IO Interactive, is working on a Bond game—currently referred to as Project 007, presumably in lieu of a more lasting title. And you can see why the studio was given the go-ahead. 47 already has a taste for dark tailoring and epigrammatic quips, loosed as sparingly as shell casings; all he needs is a martini, a toupee, and a pair of zeroes to replace the “4” in his name. The fact is that IO has been killing without the licence for years.I only wish that the developers weren’t so desperate, as of late, to heighten the resemblance. In the opening cinematic, 47 and a gloomy ally traipse over desert dunes to find a base of gleaming metal, just like the one in Spectre, where Blofeld hid in waiting. At another moment, we gaze at a crumbling country estate and are told, “It began here and it ends here”—the same damp sentiment that hung in the air as Daniel Craig stood, hands plunged into his pockets, and surveyed Skyfall Lodge. The writing, by Michael Vogt and Nick Price, teems with twists but forgets to throw up the occasional strip of straightforward plotting. I spent most of the game without the faintest idea what was happening, and now and then the dialogue felt in dire need of a second draft. When one character describes power as “the thing that gets you to the thing,” I erupted with laughter. Later on, though, it dawned on me that the line had laid the game’s biggest problem bare.The thing that used to get us to the thing wasn’t the need to foil some globe-engulfing consortium; it was professional obligation, and you need look no further than Hitman: Contracts—whose missions unfolded in 47’s memory, as he lay on a table, leaking from a gunshot wound—to see how gracefully one setting can be scissored into the next. Still, as with Bond, the narrative is only as important as where it takes us, and part of the series’ appeal—especially its rebooted run, designated “the World of Assassination trilogy”—is in the touring of luxury. In this regard, the new game does not disappoint. The Burj Al-Ghazali isn’t a bad way to start: a vertical river of glass, breaking into the heavens and resembling, at its uppermost reaches, a lighthouse on a sea of cloud. Other highlights include a half-frozen train, surging through the grey peaks of the Carpathian Mountains; and a vineyard in Argentina, ripe with festivity for the launch of a new wine—with nothing noble about the rot funding the party.One thing I relished was the way that each map would alter my style. Take the night club, in Berlin, for instance, pulsing with bass and warm bodies. My task was to hunt a team of operatives through the noise, and I was driven to abandon 47’s trademark savoir faire and gun them down, one by one, through a screaming crowd. (The shooting is robust enough to support the occasional rampage, but it’s clear that IO crafts these games with a more measured approach in mind.) My personal favourite has to be the mansion in Dartmoor: a delicious cocktail of brick and polished wood, furred with rolling fog and home to a whodunnit. In a sublime touch, we get to impersonate a detective, snooping through the butler’s pantry and mustering evidence for the lady of the house—who happens to be our target.This is where Hitman III, and its two most recent predecessors, outdoes the older games. The central mechanic that has always coiled through 47’s adventures is his penchant for sheathing himself in the clothes of his enemies, or indeed of ordinary people, and slipping by unnoticed. Here, IO has vested this feature with fresh power, using it to peel away genres; the stealth thriller becomes, with the donning of a trenchcoat and trilby, the murder mystery. Moreover, each level offers up three “Stories”: sub-plots that often allow us to draw the minor players into our hero’s slick and sanguinary art. In other words, we get the chance to turn the game in on itself—to become an NPC and invite the NPCs to shift into the key players. At one point, for example, I tricked a guard, stationed at a lofty vantage, into taking out my mark with a rifle, sending him a picture of the supposed security threat. This is a curious thrill, familiar to readers of Patricia Highsmith, whose star, Tom Ripley, enjoyed not just killing but the coaxing of uncorrupted souls to the job.Not that there is much room, in the world of Hitman, for the pure of heart. Most everyone you meet seems oiled with ulterior motives—even the bartenders—and the villains are laughably overladen. They aren’t only media barons or shipping tycoons or whatever; they’re also invariably the scions of families who own most of Manhattan and keep jacking up the rent, or who sold gunpowder in the American Civil War and made a killing. And they’re all controlling the world behind the scenes. In short, they’re Bond villains. As 47 fells each of one them, his deeds are buffed with a noble, planet-saving sheen, and I can’t help but feel as though IO has got the wrong guy. Think of the beginning of Hitman: Blood Money, where our killer was dispatched to an abandoned theme park to snuff out its desperate owner, whose life had already rattled off the rails. It was a miserable job—done, as the title made clear, for money. Despite the surface similarities, 47 could never be Bond; surface similarities, like clothes, are there to be shuffled off.That’s why, as much as Hitman III was a pleasure to play, it left me longing for the mood of the old games—for that European concoction of sirens and splashing rain, drenched in Jesper Kyd’s cold scores. I’m as excited as anyone for Project 007, but I wonder how long we will be left looking for 47—a wraith in a red tie, who has proven elusive enough to slip IO’s grasp.Developer: IO InteractivePublisher: IO InteractiveAvailable on: PlayStation 5 [reviewed on], PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Xbox Series S / X, Switch, PC, Google StadiaRelease Date: January 20, 2021To check what a review score means from us, click here.

Hitman 3,Jeff Grubb,GamesBeat,https://venturebeat.com/2021/01/19/hitman-3-review-a-world-made-entirely-out-of-chekhovs-guns/,"Connect with top gaming leaders in Los Angeles at GamesBeat Summit 2023 this May 22-23. Register here.Hitman works because developer IO Interactive builds the games as predictable and rigid machines. And as players, we control the key to this machine in Agent 47. IO’s job is to make sure that when players insert 47 into this mess of cogs and moving parts, that other parts of the machine awaken and present new opportunities for creativity. Hitman 3 in particular works because this machine is more intricate and fun to explore than ever thanks to its incredible levels.Hitman 3 takes Agent 47 to a supertower in Dubai, a murder-mystery mansion in the English countryside, a warehouse nightclub in Berlin, and more. And each of these locations nail what I want from this series and from gaming more broadly. They are enticing possibility spaces that have attractive aesthetics, but they are also brimming with so many moving parts that certain locations, like Berlin, nearly feels alive.The machinery is still obvious, of course. But Hitman 3 excels at anticipating the player’s creativity. If you see something in the world, like a giant electrical tree hanging over a crowd, IO likely anticipated your thought process and built a likely lethal reaction.This makes your initial time through a level and any alternative runs feel like a joy. Replaying a stage is great because you get to act on all the knowledge you’ve gained. But even if you only play through a level once, that canonical run where you spend 2.5 hours methodically learning the environment and putting pieces into place is deeply rewarding. I would still recommend that you go back and play each level again — subsequent attempts can look and feel like a completely different game.GamesBeat Summit 2023Join the GamesBeat community in Los Angeles this May 22-23. You’ll hear from the brightest minds within the gaming industry to share their updates on the latest developments.Hitman 3’s destinations take you to a number of cool settings. I especially like the penultimate level, which uses the signature style of the series. It combines a beautiful natural landscape with classical architecture and a modern industrial underground operation. But the depth of the interactions between the player and all of the moving parts is what makes Hitman 3’s levels great.IO Interactive primarily shows off these complex interactions in story missions, which are the authored assassinations that act almost like a guided tour through a level.Above: Who done it?Hitman 3, however, has fewer story missions than in its predecessors. The third destination in Berlin, for example, has no story missions at all. That might sound disappointing, but it isn’t. Like all of the stages in Hitman 3, this one has so much going on that it’ll take you hours to discover it all.The Berlin stage is actually indicative of the maturity of the Hitman formula. Rather than holding the player’s hand through all of the cool stuff, IO is letting players discover things on their own. And this gives you more ownership over the kills, which makes them more exhilarating and memorable.And the story missions that are here are more elaborate and intricate than what you would find in Hitman or Hitman 2. Those games primarily had you walking to a waypoint, getting a disguise, and then pressing a button. That’s opposed to something like the full murder mystery story mission (complete with clues and witness testimony) in the Dartmoor location.As usual, however, the campaign — and specifically the story missions — serve more as a tutorial to Hitman’s sandbox gameplay. And Hitman 3 does a lot to gently introduce and onboard players into replaying levels, taking on Escalation contracts, and completing challenges. Having fewer story missions is a part of that.Hitman 2016 destinations have a half dozen or more story missions, and that was way too much. Instead, Hitman 3 gives you some fun guidance and then takes the training wheels off. Hitman 3 is its most entertaining when you are finding your own fun — or at least making discoveries on your own. And reducing the story missions is a smart way to get players into that creative mindset quicker.The online progress of your character, which unlocks more tools for you to bring into levels, is still a smart way to encourage replaying stages. Certain challenges, for example, give you specific items that might make other challenges easier. Hitman 3 also introduces shortcuts that players can unlock permanently for all future runs through a level.And the sandbox is as wonderful as ever. While the authored murders are always a delight, nothing is better than coming up with your own solution using a coin, a puddle, and a faulty power strip.The biggest surprise about this series of Hitman games is that IO Interactive has attached a surprisingly moving story. Agent 47 is supposedly this blank slate, but the writing team has given him so much character. His dark quips to people he’s going to kill are always so absurd. It makes 47 seem like a big goofy dork.I also really care about the supporting cast of characters, and the developers play that up in a big way.Nothing here is Shakespeare. But in the same way that the recent Mission: Impossible movies use character and plot to string the action together, Hitman 3 uses them to string the levels together. And like a Tom Cruise movie, Hitman 3 knows when to put the love interest into danger to amp up the stakes.It rules, and I love it.And it doesn’t hurt that the game looks great. The animation is a bit stiff, but everything else has such a polished sheen. It’s reminiscent of an expensive chess set.Above: Agent 47 is the trigger to Chekhov’s gun.I’ve spent nearly 50 hours in Hitman 3 on PC, according to the Epic Games Launcher. I’m probably going to play for another 50 hours. I cannot get enough of the new destinations. I already got to level 20 mastery in the first two levels once. Now, I’m on my way to doing that again (my progress reset for the review). And I have the rest of the levels left to look forward to.But what I truly love about Hitman 3 is that it’s about payoff. In storytelling, payoff is about setting up characters arcs and then delivering on them in the third act. Hitman 3 excels at payoffs … but for gameplay and mechanics.Hitman 3 starts a stage with Agent 47 overhearing a gentleman detective talking about solving a murder. And in that instant, almost every player knows that this is going to end with 47 accusing someone of murder while wearing the detective’s costume.Hitman is a world made up entirely of Chekhov’s guns, and it’s a blast finding out how to get Agent 47 into position to pull the trigger.Hitman 3 is available on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and Stadia on January 20.

Hitman 3,Brendan Caldwell,"Rock, Paper, Shotgun",https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2021/01/19/hitman-3-review/,"""The name's Seven... Forty Seven""You know what you're getting into. The empathy-void assassin of the Hitman trilogy is an anti-Santa who only has a ""naughty"" list and never a ""nice"" one. He visits the rich and powerful once every couple of years, to shove lumps of coal down their throat because they've been selling AK-47s to babies. Here he is again in the final instalment of the most recent righteous murder trilogy. Hold Hitman 3 in your hands and you might remark it feels ""a bit light"", with the suspicious eyes of someone whose favourite cereal seems to have fewer flakes in the box every time they buy it. But what's inside still has that crunch and flavour you like, so it's hard to grumble when you're stuffing your face. Mmmmm, Emetic Poison Bran.In terms of story, we left barcode boy with some new friends and a list of names - the head honchos of various dynasties who secretly rule the world from shadowy board rooms. You know the type. You're off to take care of them amid spy thriller plot twists that see you flying from Dubai to Germany, from China to Argentina. As ever, levels are sprawling clockwork toys of NPC routines, comical eavesdropping, and gleeful killing opportunities. Pose as a waiter to neatly pour your target's poisoned wine, or lure them into the cellar to bludgeon them with the bottle. The new thing in our bald friend's arsenal is his camera, which doubles up as a hacking tool. Throughout levels you'll see terminals that let you open doors or windows from across the room with the hackcam. It's sometimes helpful, but not a significant change in the way that Hitman 2 introduced pop-up windows showing events in other rooms, or allowed you to blend into crowds. It is not exactly a revolutionary tool in 47's bulging blazer pockets. Some later uses of the hackcam include opening vents which can be opened with a simple screwdriver anyway. I only mention the camera because its addition marks the only real mechanistic difference between Hitman 2 and Hitman 3. Everything else about moving, sneaking and shooting feels identical.So if you asked me ""what is new?"" I'd have to admit it's only the levels. Maybe that's enough. Taken together, the trilogy is a cracking showcase of level design, and Hitman 3 has some of the best so far. You might have already read Alice B's misadventures in a mansion in Dartmoor, England, where you can disguise yourself as a private investigator and take part in a full-on murder mystery. This level is the first clue that the designers have decided to throw any remaining plausibility (about 0.01%) out the window and have a party. The mansion is an upper class wonderhome, all dark mahogany and priceless antiques. Filled with bodyguards, maids and gardeners, it's as much a grimly smiling parody of Downton Abbey as it is a meta-murderous take on Poirot. This is in keeping with moderno-Hitman's pedigree as a game about maintenance workers killing their paymasters. The targets throughout are as despicable as usual. Often rich, always vile, they are heirs of vast oil empires, or owners of manipulative media conglomerates. As usual the story drapes a thick veil of conspiracy theories over all its corpses-to-be. But more on that poisoned chalice in a moment. I was talking about the levels.It would be gauche to say ""Hitman 2 is the best"" or ""Hitman 3 is better"". Because when I think of Hitman, I think of individual levels, as if it were really all one game (which it sort of is, if we're being honest). I think of Marrakech, Mumbai, Sapienza, Colombia. And among those favoured levels I can now confidently add the mansion of Dartmoor and the rainy streets of Chongqing, a level in this third game that's got to be the best-looking of the lot, the exact kind of urban labyrinth I love in any game. If you sat down 10 Hitman fans and told them to come to a consensus on the best level of the series, nobody would leave the room alive. I'm glad to report Hitman 3 only adds to these arguments. In other ways, it feels like the developers, IO Interactive, are flexing their Bond muscles in anticipation of their upcoming 007 game. They like to push the ""murder this person"" formula down some interesting alleys. We saw a bit of this in the previous instalment, when 47 went to Mumbai. You didn't know the exact identity of one of your targets, only an alias, and the rest you had to figure out before finishing the job. In this trilogy-ender, that twistiness pops up again. One mission in a German factory-turned-nightclub sees you eyeing up clubbers and bar staff with paranoia as an unknown number of undercover agents pursue 47 through strobe lights and wub-wub. Leading, in my case, to a cool re-enactment of the Bondy trope of melting into the dancing crowd, pissheads and flashing lights covering a nervous escape.Another mission might see you using an algorithmic super-AI to fire the employees of an underground facility. Giving these workers the axe (only the proverbial one, 47!) has some messy, yet productive, results. In practice, this is a simplistic sequence of button presses on a sci-fi CCTV monitor but, thematically, I enjoy the message. Treat your employees like pawns and you'll get burned. It's these scenarios, along with the The Mysterious Affair At Dartmoor, that proves IO Interactive's mission designers have reached peak comfort levels with Hitman's fundamental silliness. I half expect their 007 to show up to his first party, completely bald, speaking in a deadpan American accent and insisting his name is James Bond.There's one level, set in the sunny vineyards of a powerful Argentinian family, where the mega rich have come to tango and sip Cabernet Sauvignon while gossiping amongst themselves. The happenstantial dialogue that triggers as you walk through this soiree is full of references to the previous games. Remember that arms manufacturer you killed at a race track in Miami in Hitman 2? Well, the new CEO of his company is here, chilling out as an NPC. Remember the lead singer you killed in Bangkok in Hitman 1? There's one of his former band members in the crowd. Even one of the mercenaries guarding the wine cellar gets in on the fun, complaining about his time spent protecting an Italian aristocrat in Sapienza. ""The rich are weird,"" he says, as your memory flashes back to killing a wealthy man with an exploding golf ball in 2016. The Argentine mission is both high society assassination job and love letter to the developer's dangerous little universe. It's very pleasing.This focus on the elite does mean the queasy parallels to the conspiracy theories of our own world are in plain sight. Given the recent surge in tin foil hat wearers, it's a missed opportunity that the story doesn't try to upend this kind of delusion, to subvert the unhealthy allure of the conspiracy theory. But it might be a bit late for that. Not to mention a tall order for a game which is ultimately about electrifying the head of a law firm in a puddle of his own wine. The plot is at least more grounded in reality than any Metal Gear Solid nonsense. Arms dealers and petrochemical magnates do exert some control over our nations through lobby groups and legal strong-arming, after all. And these are the actions that Diana (your earpiece helper and Edmond Dantès of the Hitmanverse) will note as qualifications for the ""naughty list"". Through pantomime villains and stylish mission briefings worthy of a HBO credits sequence, the Hitman games manifest these companies, corporations, and cartels into sneering human beings, served oven-ready, waiting for you to push them off balconies. It's less ""heroic QAnon operative frees the world"" and more ""a garbage man has killed the entire board again, somebody get the mop"". One downer. When Hitman 3 finally empties its pockets, it comes up a bit short. There are six levels, but the final level is linear and setpiecey, a total contrast to the rest of the series. It fulfils its function as a swish-looking finale, but in terms of everything Hitmanists love about the games (the poking around, the sprawl, the thread-following) this ultimate on-rails mission is the weakest moment of the whole trilogy. For a man who fires a lot of lethal rounds, 47 ends his story on a damp squib. Although it is possible to carry an expensive Fabergé egg from the beginning of this level the whole way to end, and welt it at the face of the final antagonist with deep satisfaction. So that's neat.On top of that there have been mixed messages about whether owners of the previous games will be able to import those old levels (and character stats) into this new game. Yes, the developers say, PC players will be able to do this, but the solution they've come up with still isn't clear, requiring buyers of this 1-year Epic exclusive to solve a deadly marketing riddle in order to decipher whether or not they will get their old levels when they buy this game. This is the kind of store-bound nuisance that detracts from the quality of the level design and the great hi-jinks of the game itself. It devalues what is already a £50 game. And when I remember that last linear killathon, it does feel like this is the Hitman that offers the smallest buck-to-bang ratio. In a sense, this has often been the case with Hitman. They always become more inviting as DLC levels trickle out and a sale puts everything into one basket. This will be no exception. Since its episodic beginnings, you know what you're getting into. With Ian Hitman, you know you're getting some world-class level design, some tense moments of dark comedy improv, and a type of clockwork murder toy that nobody else makes. As a final act, Hitman 3 is as capable and pleasing as its trilogy-siblings. As a trilogy, it is one of the most fun-loving games of the previous decade. It is like Ian himself - reliable, dry-humoured, uniformed. The best murderer money can buy.You're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!

Hitman 3,David Flynn,GamingTrend,https://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/hitman-world-of-assassination-review-a-killer-conclusion/,"The latest Hitman trilogy wrapped up back in 2021, but Agent 47’s work is far from over. Hitman: World of Assassination is the trilogy’s final form, bundling together almost all of the content from all three games into one package. Now that we have the whole picture, is it worth getting our hands dirty once more?I imagine the first question people will ask, given Hitman’s somewhat confusing DLC approach, is: what does The World of Assassination package actually include? You get all the maps and missions of the main story, the DLC for 3 excluding cosmetics and items, the bonus maps from Hitman 1, a VR mode, the first sniper mode map, and a new rogue-like mode called Freelancer. What this doesn’t include are the aforementioned items, cosmetics, sniper mode maps, and the two DLC maps from 2. Needless to say, this is incredibly confusing. From the name, I had assumed this would be an all-in-one package, and it mostly is, but the exclusions aside from those mostly cosmetic items feel weird, especially when 3’s DLC is included. The content itself is excellent, however, with a large variety of locations and missions. It’s neat to go back to Hitman 1 and 2 locations with the added graphical power of 3. In fact, with ray tracing on and most settings at high to medium, the game’s first area, Paris, is actually one of the most difficult to run now. I usually get 50 to 60 fps, but in Paris, my rig hovers around the 40s. It’s still playable, and I get the frames back if I turn down the settings a tad, but the added reflections and lighting improvements are worth it in my opinion. The game has also added Elusive Targets, assassinations where you only get one shot with no saves, back into the game in a rotation. It’s nice to have these back in the Arcade mode, but they come with further complications that make them more annoying than fun this time around. For example, you may be asked to assassinate the target with a melee weapon or only use one disguise. Thankfully, these are completely optional now, which rebalances the difficulty to walk that tightrope between frustrating and fun. I do wish I could just practice these with saves enabled for fun, waiting 12 hours between attempts is still weird for a single-player game, but simply having them back in the game is good. This bundle was my first experience with Hitman’s VR mode, which is less than ideal for a few reasons. For one, using an Oculus Quest 2 connected to my PC via a 10Gps USB C cable offered a very janky and stuttery experience, with framerate dips and my hands jerking around. Second, the controls themselves just aren’t accurate enough, especially when throwing or sniping. Picking things up or knocking out guards from behind is simple enough, with a good amount of wiggle room for your gestures, but the throwing motion required of you is way too specific. I tried about 15 different ways to throw a brick at a guard’s head in the tutorial, and the gesture that finally worked felt more like a light shove than what was happening in my headset. Sniping is much worse, possibly due to my non-optimal setup, with my controller jerking around and taking me out of the scope view constantly. It’s more than likely you may have a better experience with a different setup, but I found it to be unplayable.We’ve covered all the other game modes and features in previous reviews, so let’s move on to this package’s highlight: Freelancer. Freelancer is a rogue-like mode where you need to complete a campaign of four contracts, each with several assassinations within, in a row without dying, saving, or letting the target escape. To be perfectly honest, I’m not very good at Hitman, but I still really like this mode. In lieu of the usual menu, 47 now has a home base where he stores all his gear, all of which you need to procure on-site and bring back after completing the mission. Weapons such as guns and knives persist across campaigns if stored in the hideout, while more situational items like poisons, rubber ducks, crowbars, and wrenches are lost if you fail the campaign. As you complete contracts and campaigns, your mastery of the mode will level up granting you access to more of the hideout with more things to do inside. For example, you can unlock a shooting range to practice, an office, and even appropriately grim motivational posters to hang in the hallways. Some posters are unfortunately locked behind further DLC packs, which only serves to remind me of the confusing release model here. Regardless, I really like having a base of operations. It’s not as quick or efficient as a menu, but actually planning what to bring (your loadout is restricted by a points system) gives a nice physicality to the setup phase. I wouldn’t mind having the option to do this in the main campaign, though I’d still want the menu for convenience. Once you’ve selected a contract, you’ll choose one of the multiple locations (you can go to maps you don’t own too) where your targets can be found. A location can have one or more targets to assassinate, for example, you may need to take out a gardener in Italy who’s part of a criminal syndicate as well as a well-dressed woman making a business deal. While each mission has a base payout, you can get even more cash to spend on new tools of the trade by completing optional objectives like making the kill look like an accident or not being caught on security cameras. These seem to be similar to the arcade mode optional objectives, but the randomness of this mode makes them more feasible I feel. The randomness of the assassinations themselves can be a lot of fun to puzzle out. For one objective, I needed to eliminate a guard who was constantly walking around in a group of three. I spent about half an hour watching him for an opening and found none. So eventually, when the group was less exposed, I just went ahead and shot him in the head and ran away. The absurd hilarity of Hitman is on full display here, with fewer options comes more creative assassinations and more uses for items like the exploding phones and rubber ducks.Once you’ve killed your target and returned to base, you’ll be rewarded with your choice of one of three items, all randomly chosen from a huge pool. When you only have one location in your contract remaining, that mission will turn into something of a Where’s Waldo. Your target is the head of that particular syndicate, identifiable from a set of clues like clothing, hair color or style, and habits such as being a foodie or very thirsty. It’s usually not too hard to pick out your true target from your selection of purple-highlighted suspects, but if you’re having trouble you can always just kill all of them. However, if the group is alerted to your presence, the leader will try to escape. If they do so, the campaign will fail, but intentionally triggering the escape may make picking out the leader a lot easier. Finishing a full contract will gain you an even better, random reward. You then choose another contract to tackle, with the cycle repeating four times for a full campaign in increasing difficulty. So far, I’ve only managed to reach the second set of contracts, but the mode is a ton of fun and I’ll definitely keep chipping away at it.The mode is well suited to the portability of the Steam Deck, with each contract taking half an hour give or take. The game isn’t quite optimized for the deck, however, with in-game text being almost illegible outside of subtitles and some menus. Still, if you’re familiar enough with the game, that’s not too big of an issue, though I hope they can improve the experience in that regard. I play on deck with low to medium settings at 40 fps (using the deck’s 40 hz mode). On the more intense maps, this gives me about an hour and forty minutes of battery life, and I’m sure you can squeeze even more out with further lowered settings and fps. Playing portably does come with a few oddities and annoyances, however. Hitman is unfortunately still an always online experience, and going into sleep mode or disconnecting will require you to either reconnect to the server or continue playing with an offline profile; losing access to certain features and unlockables. For a single-player game, this is just stupid. It’s not like I need the server to play anything but the Elusive and Custom Contracts, so other modes should be free of these shackles. On another note, I find I need to press the deck’s bumpers a lot harder in this game for them to work, whereas other games register the input easily. It leads to me having an uncomfortable grip on the device, though this may just be a me thing.Hitman: World of Assassination brings together most of the trilogy’s content in a convenient package. While what’s excluded and the always online requirements are baffling, the game itself is still a ton of fun with the new Freelancer mode bringing you to locations from all three games. This is a great way to dive in for newcomers, though veterans will be confused as to what’s not included and why. —David FlynnSee below for our list of partners and affiliates:One of the longest running independent gaming news, reviews and culture sites on the web.The thing that is magical about the Wizarding World isn’t the magic – it’s...by Ron BurkeThe world is going to end.

Hitman 3,David Burdette,GamingTrend,https://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/a-clean-kill-hitman-3-review/,"There’s nothing like dropping into a party, sneaking around, killing a guard to take his uniform, and dropping a light fixture on top of a guy all the while getting out unnoticed. While many games have attempted the ultimate stealth operation, like Splinter Cell or Metal Gear Solid, I hold to the idea that Hitman has done it better than just about anyone. It’s brand of both brutal infiltration and hilarious assassination are unmatched, and whenever you touch this sandbox of slaughter you tend to find a new way to take out your target. Hitman 3 is sadly a finale of a series that has long been a staple in the genre, but our journey into why the end of this trilogy is the best it has ever been is just beginning.So if it wasn’t obvious, the main objective of this game is killing people. But it’s not a barbaric massacre along the lines of Postal, instead you have specific targets and it comes across more as a ballet of extermination. Simply put, Hitman 3 is a puzzle game in which you have to figure out the best way to dispose of your target and make it out alive. In this ending of the series, you’re going up against some members of the organization you originally worked for. Yes, I know this is following after the spy movie trope of “what, the people I’m working for are bad”, but the story in Hitman takes a backseat to the gameplay. The story is just fine mind you, but it sadly just doesn’t matter as much in the long run. I can say it felt more fluid with both the narrative a than the previous two games, which is a good step up in my opinion.Of course, the one way you can get away with a story that isn’t as “in depth” is to provide superb gameplay, and Hitman 3, and honestly 1 and 2, are amazing in this area. Hitman 3 is astounding, especially on next-gen platforms and PC. Playing at 60fps on PS5 has been a dream, with the clarity of 1800p and the shadowing adding to an already gorgeous package. I have to applaud IO Interactive’s decision to showcase the Scepter skyscraper mission at the very beginning of the game, because the atmosphere is dazzling. Just look for yourself in our footage above, it’s almost impossible to describe just how captivating the environment of it all is.Now when it comes to assassinating your foes, there isn’t another game out there that is this comprehensive. What was mentioned in the intro is truly only one piece of a massive puzzle, and there are so many ways to go about your killing sprees. The best part is half the time you luck into junctures where you “discover” news ways to get rid of your prey, and others you just straight miss the moment.I did a mission disguised as an underworld hitman (the irony was quite enjoyable), and after killing a reporter at the party that was asking too many questions I had a face to face with my quarry. Now, there were guards around, and I didn’t make a move, but before long I was escorted out and realized I missed my chance. I had to try another way, and even then I screwed up and called him to dinner before I could poison his food. I randomly got lucky in my running around his penthouse dressed as a servant in walking into the bathroom and he was just standing there. A quick swirly of death and a run out the side of the building to parachute away, and the mission was complete. But even then the ridiculous amount of things I hadn’t done according to the tracker showing my accomplishments during that playthrough was staggering.It’s best to keep this in mind when playing Hitman 3, because there are only six locations you’ll be able to play if you aren’t importing previous levels. Even then, that’s only six NEW missions to play through, but the replayability and new ways to dispatch your kill will keep you playing it over and over. The side missions are also a blast to do, even if they don’t end in the death of your target. The Dartmoor location that houses Thornbridge Manor contains one of my favorites in the game, Death In The Family. If you choose to procure the detective disguise, it leads you into an investigation where you must figure out who killed Alexa Carlisle’s (your prey) brother, Zachary. He has seemingly commited suicide, but she doesn’t believe that in the slightest. This mission turns into a near facsimile of the movie Knives Out, and it’s simply brilliant. Those who just play Hitman to complete it are going to miss out on a lot of interesting things that exist off the beaten path, so it’s important to take your sweet time and smell the roses. Hitman 3 is amazing because there is so much contained in each location, and going back over and over again is never a chore but a delight.One of the things that impresses me most with Hitman 3 is the ability to import the levels from both Hitman 1 and 2. Yes, you heard me correctly, you can bring both games in their fullness to this platform and, not only that, enjoy the benefit of how wonderfully Hitman 3 plays. While you do have to own them previously (and importing does require several pain in the butt steps), the potential of literally tripling the level count is awesome.While Hitman 3 does a ton right, I have to say I was disappointed in the use of the Dualsense controller. I’m really glad developers are experimenting with it rather than just leaving it be, but IO didn’t utilize it as well as I may have thought. The only thing that really happens is the triggers tightening a bit while aiming and pulling the trigger, which is fine, but given Hitman 3 spends most of its time rewarding you for operating stealthily and killing only your targets, it feels like the adaptive triggers fade into the background. The same can be said for the haptics, which at least to me felt more or less like regular rumble. IO is a really smart team, so I would have loved to have seen what they could’ve done if they had more time with the controller, but maybe they’ll come up with some cool stuff for their recently announced James Bond game.The last thing I want to go over with Hitman 3 is some of the platform specific features, mainly PSVR and the Switch and Stadia version of the game. PSVR was one of the most surprising announcements for the game, and I definitely pushed for our review to be on PlayStation just because of it. I can come to you after playing it for a while to say it functions and the amount of content and fun of PSVR far outweighs the janky controls. Let’s get the bad news out of the way, you have to play with the PS4 version of the game for VR, even if you have a PS5. That means any benefit of the Dualsense is gone. But even more unwelcome is the fact that you have to use a controller and there isn’t any motion controller use. I know the Move controllers aren’t the best in the world, but at least they do pretty decent one for one movement. This also leaves you having to use the sticks to walk, and while it probably is due to design not having a teleport option can make you a bit nauseous, and I’m pretty good at not succumbing to VR motion sickness.The good news is that Hitman 3 in PSVR functions pretty darn well all things considered. Once I got my bearings and learned how to operate the controls it was a pleasant experience. As you can see in the gameplay, I follow a similar route to what I do in the PS5 gameplay, and it has largely the exact same layout as the levels do without VR. The best thing is PSVR extends to ALL Hitman content, including Hitman 1 and 2 locations. If you were looking for a packed VR adventure you won’t beat in two hours, this is definitely it. Sure, it isn’t as pretty as the PS5 version, but it’s a lot of fun to put yourself underneath Agent 47’s shiny dome.If you don’t have a device that can run Hitman 3, you also have the choice of playing not one, but two streaming versions! Stadia is about what you’d expect from any of our other coverage of the platform, it looks and plays great but is a slightly suboptimal version due to the introduced input lag, and your experience will vary depending on your internet connection. For example, the day the game launched I was booted from the game every few minutes, but the very next day it played about as well as Hitman 2 on my PS4 Pro. It runs at 60 fps on the platform and looks fantastic, though with the typical Stadia blur. The other streaming version is the Cloud Version on Switch, which is a bit rougher than Stadia. It runs at 30 fps, though it looks like it dips below that occasionally if your connection isn’t stable, technically it doesn’t but it appears so on your screen. Streaming is weird. According to my very unscientific tests, Cloud Version introduces ever so slightly more input lag, which isn’t a huge problem since Hitman relies more on planning than quick reaction but it is definitely noticeable and you can test for yourself with the very short free trial. While I maintain Google should definitely release a Stadia app for Switch so we can get the best of both worlds, for now both options are good choices to play Hitman 3 slightly more portably.As with all digital products however, these come with the caveat that they may not be around forever. Hitman 3 Cloud Version even says you’re purchasing an access pass, not the game itself. It’s a problem we don’t really have a solution for as older online storefronts shut down and games exclusive to them are lost to time. Not every game is going to get resurrected like Scott Pilgrim, and who knows if these streaming services will stand the test of time. These are good versions of a great game, but it’s hard not to have this fear in the back of your mind.Hitman 3 is the ultimate Hitman experience, period. The game runs almost improbably crisp, and each location is a ton of fun to explore. Replayability is a must, but not just because of the brevity of the campaign, but because there is so much to do in each one. Adding the missions of yesteryear appends even more to the package, along with the ability to be the assassin in VR or take it on the go with Stadia or Switch. I could try and nitpick it for what it doesn’t do or where it comes up short (of which there’s almost nothing), but when it comes to being an early contender for Game Of The Year, Hitman 3 hits its target dead center.—David Burdette and David FlynnSee below for our list of partners and affiliates:One of the longest running independent gaming news, reviews and culture sites on the web.The thing that is magical about the Wizarding World isn’t the magic – it’s...by Ron BurkeThe world is going to end.

Hitman 3,Keith Stuart,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/jan/22/hitman-3-review-a-wild-bacchanalian-backdrop-to-bloody-escapades,"PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC; IO InteractiveIndustrialised murder probably shouldn’t be this entertaining, but this final part of the trilogy is a minor masterpieceIt is when I am shot by two armed guards while attempting to steal a banana from a desk that I realise Hitman is a game of contradictions. On one hand, it is a deadly serious assassination sim; on the other it is a slapstick comedy, where you can disguise yourself as a chef and knock someone out with a bottle of merlot. Industrialised murder probably shouldn’t be hilarious, but that’s video games for you. This is the beautiful paradox of the whole series.The set up to Hitman 3 is exactly the same as the previous two instalments of this reenergised stealth adventure series. Deadly protagonist Agent 47 is given a series of assassination targets, each located in a different open world environment, whether that’s a towering Dubai skyscraper or an abandoned warehouse in Chongqing, China. You just show up and take care of everyone on the list.You’re free to work out your own approach to the hit, eavesdropping on staff conversations for vital clues, hacking computers and exploring every nook and cranny to discover and build the components of an elaborate murder attempt. Do you want to poison the victim with their favourite whisky, electrocute them or simply isolate them from their bodyguards, snap their neck and stuff them in a cupboard? It’s up to you. As ever there are mission stories you can choose to follow, which provide specific routes through the game, but it’s just as much fun to explore each of these dense possibility spaces, watching everyone’s routines play out and putting your own terrible plan together.And these are some of the most intricate, multifaceted dioramas developer IO Interactive has ever devised. A wonderful sequence in a Devonshire mansion has you exploring vast, richly decorated rooms, laden with antique furniture and family portraits. In a lovely twist, one of the mission stories gets you to play as a private detective investigating a murder in the house – a witty nod to Poirot. Elsewhere, Agent 47 crashes a picturesque winery, a hi-tech datacentre and, best of all, a Berlin warehouse rave, sneaking through the bars and dancefloors to avoid a group of assassins sent to kill him. The pumping techno, strobing lights and ecstatic dancers provide a wild bacchanalian backdrop to your bloody escapades.Alongside all the usual items Agent 47 carries – screwdrivers, crowbars, rat poison – he now has a camera he can use to search rooms for clues and scan electronic locks so they can be hacked and opened. It feels like an unnecessary nod to games such as Batman and Watch Dogs and adds very little to the experience. Meanwhile, the forgettable narrative, about secret organisations warring for control of the world, is the stuff of straight-to-Netflix spy thrillers, and feels slight and formulaic beside the crazed stories that players get to make for themselves.The sheer openness of the settings, and the game design itself, have made the modern Hitman titles hugely replayable, and the third title in the series continues that legacy. A generous range of specific challenges can be unlocked for each of the six environments, pushing you to complete missions with different equipment, approaches and restrictions, and the keenest players will want to aim for high scores via speedy, non-lethal run-throughs, honed after days of experimentation. Every time you think you’ve seen everything, you stumble on a hidden room, a new passcode, an intriguing subplot and you’re back in again.Hitman has become a benchmark for generous sandbox game design, in which the developers trust players to work things out for themselves and reward them for doing so. The sheer amount of intrinsic information the game world feeds you – from signposts to whiteboard notes to snippets of overhead conversations – can feel overwhelming, but it also immerses you in a way that no hand-holding, over-didactic, icon-filled HUD ever could. When you mess up in Hitman, it’s your fault; the next time you attempt to steal a banana while in the vicinity of guards with assault rifles, you will plan it better.In this way, the final part of the modern Hitman trilogy is a minor masterpiece, a treasure trove of unforgettable player-generated moments. It doesn’t add any new ideas to the series, but perhaps it didn’t need to – because this is a game that lets you come up with the ideas, whether good, bad, deadly or ridiculous.Hitman 3 is available now; £49.99"
Hitman 3,Tom Hoggins,Telegraph,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/features/hitman-3-review-pulsating-finale-gamings-inventive-thriller/,"
			Io Interactive send off Agent 47 with a sharp and varied globe-trotting farewell
		For all of the elaborate assassinations that have permeated the Hitman series --fashionista mishaps, explosive motorsport podiums, malfunctioning armed robots-- the most fascinating contract of Hitman 3 remains the one that developer Io strikes with its players.There is a certain understanding that when you step into the shoes of the follically-challenged Agent 47, you will embrace the blackly-comic murder sandboxes in the spirit in which they are built. Sure, you could just try and wander in with a pistol, charge up to your target, pop them in the head before running away again. But where is the fun in that? Where is the theatre?Much better to step into the role, blend in, observe and wait for the right moment to strike. There is little more satisfying in video games than a perfectly-executed Silent Assassin run. In return, Io have offered up some career-best stuff in Hitman 3. Its selection of six missions boast a splendid variety both between and within themselves. The Dubai opening has you skydiving onto the world’s tallest skyscraper and sneaking into a grotesquely opulent penthouse soiree, mingling with the guests before perhaps knocking out a waiter and blending into the workforce. Invisible to the wealthy as you seek to isolate your two targets. Dartmoor has you infiltrating a remote country pile. Berlin drops you into a heaving, pulsating nightclub. More on these shortly.The gag is that Agent 47 stands out like a sore thumb in almost any given situation: an imposing, exquisitely bald stranger with piercing blue eyes and a barcode stamped on the back of his head. But the other agreement between player and developer is that suspension of disbelief that makes him the ultimate shape-shifter. Much of the fun in deciphering 47’s contracts gives you an amount of knowingly ‘video gamey’ leeway. Being able to take over as a VIP but knocking him out in the toilets and wandering back out in his clothes, no questions asked -- even though you look kind of like that cook who just served up a dodgy plate of dumplings. Indeed, it is Hitman’s economy here that allows Io to be so flexible within its levels. The Dartmoor mission is a particularly potent example of this. Io have always provided a selection of ‘Mission Stories’ that you can discover within each map, narrative threads that guide you to 47’s more elaborate executions. Dartmoor allows you to disguise yourself as a private Detective summoned to the house to solve a mysterious death. Pick up the thread and the level provides a full-blown locked-door murder mystery, having you interrogate suspects, rifle through rooms and scan evidence using you newly added smart-camera.It is relatively prescribed but superbly done, and partway into your investigation you may well forget that your mission is to off the matriarch of the family rather than play Poirot. The Detective disguise gives 47 almost free reign across the level, but pursue a different path and it becomes a more imposing area teeming with private guards, serving staff and gardeners.Hitman 3 follows closely in its recent predecessors footsteps --a trip to a lavish Argentinian winery is a defined nod to a vintage Hitman: Blood Money mission-- but that it can flip focus so readily is what impresses the most. The mission in a raucous Berlin nightclub is both peak Hitman and a shuddering change of pace. Within a cavernous, multi-levelled nightspot, 47 must dispatch five of 10 agents silly enough to try taking him down.There are no mission threads here and targets are hidden until you uncover them, with you mingling with the throng of club-goers (I’m not sure a video game has ever captured the throbbing disorientation of a nightclub with such discomfiting elan) and picking them off one-by-one. It is pure exhilaration to play predator under laser lights, isolating goons and snapping their neck or, oops, shoving one off a balcony onto the writhing dancefloor below.It is something of a shame that, having showed such brilliance and consistency across the game’s opening five missions that the grand finale is a bit of a bust. Hitman 3 wraps up this new trilogy’s World of Assassination yarn, a pot-boiling thriller involving 47 and long-time handler Diana travelling the world in order to dismantle a nefarious secret society.Io clearly felt the need to end the series on a cinematic high, with a final mission that takes the gloves off and allows 47 to blast his way towards his final target. But rather than the catharsis that suggests, it becomes a so-so trek down a corridor that rather misjudges the excellence of what has come before. Hitman’s storytelling is sharpest within levels -- small character moments in overheard snippets of conversation or subtle world-building-- rather than the take it or leave it overarching plot.Still, this is hardly a dealbreaker. Once you have murdered your way through the game for the first time, you will immediately want to jump back into missions to try things a different way. New starting points and equipment drops open up with every completion, trimming any excess and allowing you to push and pull at the very edges of each level. You can make your own fun, or Io provide a selection of challenges requiring specific weapons or disguises in which to perform your wetwork. The six levels here do seem a fairly slim offering on the surface, but they become more intoxicating the more you explore.And so 47 slinks into the shadows for a well-earned break. Next, Io will move onto another famous agent in the form of James Bond; a more perfect match I’m not sure you could find.  But do so with a fine and fitting send-off for gaming’s slickest, most inventive thriller."

Here’s how it works.For 20 years, the Hitman series has delivered some of the most ambitious and most creative stealth games on the market, and that trend is set to continue with Hitman 3, the final entry in the World of Assassination trilogy that started with 2016's Hitman reboot. Players are thrust back into the bespoke suit of Agent 47, a genetically-engineered assassin tasked with killing some of the most infamous people in the world.Since adopting an open-world design in Hitman 2016, IO Interactive has been able to polish and build upon the non-linear gameplay of earlier Hitman games to staggering new heights. As a result, Hitman 3 offers some of the best missions in any Hitman game yet. However, uneven pacing, a massive paywall, and a lackluster conclusion cap the new trilogy with a limp whimper instead of the thunderous applause the series deserves.Bottom line: Hitman 3 features some of the most complex and most creative levels in the series history while polishing the gameplay to perfection. Unfortunately, it's held back by some hefty paywalls, uneven mission pacing, and some occasional clunky AI.When talking about the new Hitman trilogy, it might help to think of Hitman 3 as the third season in the series' revival. On its surface, Hitman 3 is not too different from the previous two Hitman games. Players must sneak through an open world sandbox and try to figure out how best to murder their target and make an escape without a trace. In Hitman 3, there are many small improvements that make the latest installment the best-looking Hitman game to date as well as the most fun to play.IO Interactive spent the last three years refining the core Hitman gameplay, and it is near perfect in Hitman 3. The game just feels good to play, and the densely packed levels breathe life into every encounter. Hitman 3 delivers some of the most complex and interesting missions in the game's history, made larger than life thanks to some very cinematic opening sequences. Some of my favorites include solving a murder mystery reminiscent of 2019's Knives Out and playing a game of cat and mouse with a group of assassins in a crowded underground rave. No one creates a murder-filled playground quite like the Hitman devs.Players are then rewarded for their exploration of levels and their patience. Each mission has a few predetermined assassination scenarios, but you're free to approach each kill as you please. Poison your target, stage an accident, or going in guns blazing are all viable options for getting the job done. New to the series is a camera that allows Agent 47 to gather intel and manipulate locked doors and windows, as well as permanent shortcuts scattered across levels that allow for easier navigation during repeat playthroughs.The game encourages multiple playthroughs and it's unlikely that each one will be the same.Every mission also features a set of challenges that earn the player experience points that unlock more options for mission replays. Challenges include pulling off specific types of kills or changing into specific outfits found throughout the mission. Despite there only being six levels, the game encourages multiple playthroughs and it's unlikely that each one will be the same.You can still import missions and modes from Hitman and Hitman 2, as well as your progress from Hitman 2 directly into Hitman 3 as long as you own the previous games. This allows you to experience older levels in the latest game engine and play the entire story in one go. Players can also create custom contracts to share with other players online in the same way they did in previous games, although you'll need the older Hitman games to access the older game's contracts. Sniper Assassin, the multiplayer mode introduced in Hitman 2, is no longer playable online, but can still be played solo. Hitman 2's Ghost Mode, on the other hand, was cut entirely.While Hitman 3 features some of the most ambitious and multi-layered levels in the series history, the Hitman series has a habit of taking one step forward and two steps back. The game's pacing takes a turn for the worse during the back half of the game, particularly in the game's finale. I won't spoil anything here, but it would end on a flat note. That's not to say the later missions are bad, but they just don't reach the highs of the first few levels.The Hitman series has a habit of taking one step forward and one step back.I also had a problem with the content available in the game. If you purchase Hitman 3, you'll have access to six missions and the contract mode... and that's it. If you want access to the previous game's missions or the Sniper Assassin mode, you'll have to buy the older games. Depending on your preference of digital or physical, getting all the game's content could cost anywhere between $50 and $150 on top of Hitman 3.While it's by no means necessary to own the previous games, aside from the new story missions there's not much else that's new. Hitman 3 feels like an expansion pack that's incomplete without the previous games. I also wish that IO Interactive could implement an account system that would allow users who own the game across platforms to still be able to access their content instead of locking it to a single platform.Another area where these games have always faltered is with their finicky AI, and that remains the case in Hitman 3. Even on higher difficulties, enemies can sometimes get caught up on doors or just run in a single file into your line of fire. Gunplay is also just as stiff as it was in previous games, although the melee weapons are still a blast to use. Chucking a banana across a conference room and knocking someone out will never cease to amuse. Fans of the infamous homing suitcase will also be pleased.If you own the previous games, then Hitman 3 is a must-own. The game is a culmination of years spent refining the Hitman formula. The stealth gameplay is rewarding, and the open-world missions invite exploration, creativity, and lots of replayability. The level of detail is staggering, and it's just fun to run around and uncover a shortcut or a new weapon to whack someone with. Even without the previous games, Hitman 3 is still worth your time, but you may not be able to avoid the phantom pain of older campaigns.At its core, Hitman 3 is fun to play and the first few levels of this installment are some of the best in Hitman's history. Unfortunately, the game starts to lose steam as it approaches the finish line. If you own the previous games, or if you're willing to spend the additional cash necessary, Hitman 3 has a lot to offer, and even if you don't, it's still a lot of fun to explore the incredibly detailed levels and find unique ways to pull off the perfect kill.With IO Interactive's upcoming James Bond project on the horizon, I can only imagine what the Hitman team will be able to do, especially considering how sophisticated the Glacier engine has become. Until then, the bald man with the bar code on his head is more than enough.Just shy of greatnessAn imperfect killHitman 3 is an excellent entry in the Hitman franchise but requires the previous games in the series to be appreciated as a whole.Zackery Cuevas is a writer for Windows Central, Android Central, and iMore.

Hitman 3,Ule Lopez,Wccftech,https://wccftech.com/review/hitman-world-of-assassination-freelancer-mode-a-flawed-new-endeavor/,"Hitman 3 became Hitman: World of Assassination, and with this new name change came the addition of Freelancer Mode, which allows players to take on a new role in Agent 47's history. This new gameplay mode essentially acts as a whole new game in which players enter a roguelike mode where freedom is the main concept.For a while, we've had glimpses of what the game mode would look like. Some players were even able to participate in the Closed Technical Test, which allowed the developers at IO Interactive to implement several changes to the mode based on feedback. So, after all is said and done, what does this new Freelancer Mode bring to the table, and is it worth playing? Let's find out.In Freelancer mode, players will be faced with the task of taking down several criminal Syndicates through a variety of campaigns. The primary objective is to identify each of the Syndicate members and then finish things off by tracking and taking down the Syndicate leader in a Showdown. Each successful mission gives you a payout of this mode's currency, known as Merces, allowing you to purchase weapons and freelancer tools to aid you in your mission.Oh, yeah, did I forget to mention that Freelancer Mode also completely cleans you out? No longer will you be able to engage in missions with whatever weapons and tools you want. Instead, you have to go and find these weapons and tools inside the maps as you slay your targets or buy them through the newly introduced Suppliers, who will take your hard-earned Merces and give you some nice weapons such as Sniper Rifles or Pistols and SMGs.This approach, in and of itself, brings a completely new approach to the way players engage with Hitman. You have to pull off successful missions to earn more Merces and, subsequently, completely gather the weapons and tools for your arsenal. However, there's also one more caveat that needs to be noted. If you ever fail the mission (either by the target escaping or dying) you will lose whatever gear you brought alongside a portion of your Merces.What starts as a rather simple mission structure for Hitman: World of Assassination becomes a test in which players must juggle a risk vs. reward approach. Each campaign gives players a wide variety of missions that have different requirements to be fulfilled. Of course, you will need to pick the missions that suit your current inventory or use your Merces to buy the items you need to accomplish the mission.The game doesn't leave you completely naked, though. Each of the maps will include a variety of boxes that can home a random assortment of items. You can get useful tools such as noisemakers and some poisons to even weapons of varying rarities. If you're lucky, you might even find some elusive weapons.If you accomplish each of the campaign's missions, you're also rewarded with one of three random Freelancer Tools, which you can take with you to your next mission. Once you complete the campaign and take down the leader of the Syndicate, you'll be awarded a random weapon that will be available to you permanently (until you lose it by failing a mission, of course).There is one more aspect that I neglected to mention about this, which might become one of the worst punishments that the game will have to offer. If you end up losing the campaign, you will also lose all your Freelancer Tools. In addition, you will also lose your progress over the other campaigns and will be forced to start from scratch.There are two ways to reach this failure state. The first occurs if you die during a Showdown mission or the target escapes. The second occurs if you fail a mission in a High Alert stage. When you fail a mission, the Syndicate will go under High Alert, placing more guards and hazards along the way and making your way to the target a whole lot harder.You don't necessarily have to fail a mission for a High Alert mission to show up, however. As you progress through various campaigns, each stage will become harder as you go along. However, as an offset to this issue, you will also begin to receive better Merces payouts for the trouble.Suppose all of this, alongside the additional objectives that pop up whenever you pick a mission, isn't enough for you. In that case, you can challenge yourself with the Freelancer Mode's Prestige Objectives, which allow you to pick one of three different missions that reward you with a big payout. While completing these additional objectives is optional, it's satisfying to see all the missions marked down and letting the cash flow in so you can buy much better weapons.All this is done to increase your Mastery level in the Freelancer mode. As you gain more levels, you will be able to expand your safehouse and gain access to various different places and furniture decorations. Thus, you'll be able to give 47 a place he can call home. I won't mince words here; this is definitely the best part of the whole Freelancer experience, as you can see 47 take on the sights of the beautiful house he lives in while he does various other activities like fishing or maintaining his garden.As you expand your safehouse, you'll also be able to access various other hidden weapons, which will be refreshed every time you come back from a mission. That way, you will always have access to weapons, fiber wires, and even homemade explosives/poisons regardless of whether or not you fail your current mission and lose all your weapons and Freelancer tools.The safehouse is a fun area to explore in and of itself. Especially because you get invaded by this sense of loneliness as 47 does these activities. While Diana Burnwood accompanies him, you can only hear her voice whenever she gives you a mission briefing. Other than that, 47 will always be alone, exploring the nice home he lives in and making the most out of it. There's no longer any organization to work for or some plot about one of his brothers. This time, it's all about 47 and his own story in the world of assassination.From all I've been saying thus far, you'd think I'd be ready to call this mode an excellent way to expand the limits of the World of Assassination. Unfortunately, Freelancer Mode has a myriad of issues that can even turn off some of the game's most hardened veterans. This game mode leaves me questioning, at times, whether or not it was even playtested before it was released.Let's start with the easy stuff. This game mode is riddled with bugs affecting performance and even the game's stability in general, from framedrops and stutters in areas where the game never struggled for me before (looking at you, Chonqing) to NPCs gaining the ability to walk through the air and summoning enforcers as soon as they are killed as if it were Cyberpunk 2077 all over again.On one occasion, which I wish I were recording, I was playing through the game like normal in Chonqing, and, out of nowhere, the scooters in the parking lot near the arcade proceeded to spontaneously combust, leaving me dead and losing my precious Collector's Sieker Gun and Striker for no apparent reason. Even the safehouse isn't safe (hehe) from these issues, as one of the places you can redecorate has a spot that entirely softlocks you from doing anything at all, forcing you to restart the whole mode entirely.Don't get me started on the spawn points, either. Freelancer mode picks a random spawning point whenever you begin a mission. Sometimes they can be the very first spawn point, allowing you to start your mission as you normally would in any other run in the vanilla game, or you could be put in a spawning point where you're surrounded by a bunch of enforcers, leaving you in a spot where you'll be forced to fight off significant opposition before you can even start doing your mission.I'll grant the mode that this is an issue that extends to the vanilla game as well. But, in the vanilla mode, you were at least able to spawn with a disguise so that you were able to play without the worry of being here. In Freelancer, you have to either wait for the guards to go away, take cover if you are pretty much surrounded by guards and bring heavy weaponry with you, or get escorted out of the building due to trespassing. I know for a fact that some Hitman players wouldn't want to deal with that in the first place.Another aspect that I neglected to mention about the mission structure of Freelancer is that, after clearing the first set of Syndicates, you'll be able to tackle what's known as Hardcore Mode. If you're going to play Freelancer, for the love of god, don't pick Hardcore Mode. This mode is where the bugs and glitches that this game mode has become the most apparent, no thanks to the fact that maps are set to the hardest possible difficulty (using NPC AI from the vanilla Hitman Master difficulty).Hardcore also makes sub-missions mandatory, meaning that you have to complete those AND the Prestige Objective of your choice if you want the mission to be successful. On top of this, you will also no longer be able to see lootable boxes or couriers on the map, which means that these resources will become way harder to find unless you rely purely on their specific sound cues.The worst part about all of this is definitely the way some Prestige Objectives can pop up that completely contradict the objectives set in your main mission. The most egregious of these is when I got assigned a mission in which I had to take down six guards and the target with Perfect Shooter (never miss your shots/only headshots), but then my choice of Prestige Objective was a choice between getting Melee Kills, Silent Assassin - No Firearms, and Open Safe - Explosion in a stage that doesn't even have a safe in it.I was lucky that the mission took place in Whittleton Creek, a place that essentially provides a lot of Melee weapons. Otherwise, I would've been screwed out of this mission. I also think this is the best time to mention that this review was done in conjunction with my friend and other fellow Hitman enthusiast, Legon Avannor. You probably remember seeing him in Perish. We experienced Hardcore Mode and were exposed to the same degree of pain. Kudos to him for being able to stomach and complete a full run of the mode, though. Not like I'm left without my own highlights, either.All of this added pain builds up to... Nothing, really, as the payouts you get from clearing the missions aren't any different from the normal mode. In addition, clearing stages in Hardcore doesn't even award you with any other weapons that you wouldn't get in the normal Freelancer mode. Did I mention that Hardcore mode also puts every mission in High Alert, meaning that if you fail it, you have to start all the way over from scratch?I think the best way I can summarize the number of issues that Hitman Freelancer Mode has is with the second screenshot that you can see above. Look at how in the Instinct mode, you can see two outlines that say there are no enforcers nearby, and then in the minimap, you not only see there are quite a lot more NPCs around 47, but also they are all enforcers except for one, a guy who is a civilian anyway.I don't buy IO Interactive's reasoning about how they removed the penalty in Freelancer mode due to ""accessibility for players who have blackouts."" I firmly believe that the reason why there was no penalty introduced in the first place, players would be incredibly mad at them because a lot of hardcore players would have to resort to Alt+F4ing the game to get one chance at getting each campaign done in this mode.But even then, all of these issues and bugs and glitches extend to the normal mode anyway. The appearance of enforcers, the random spawn points, the horrible NPC and objective placement, which can spawn a target either right next to you or at the other end of the map inside of a hostile area full of enforcers, and everything else I mentioned thus far, and you'll end up losing your weaponry and freelancer tools more often than you might expect.Hitman Freelancer Mode is great as a concept but has faltered quite a lot in its execution. It's not the worst experience I've had in the world of assassination (hi, Colorado!), but it has left me with quite a sour taste. This is even odder when you consider that they had a Closed Technical Test and made a big deal about picking up feedback from Hitman player data and metrics.So, why is this game mode the way it is with such a rough level of polish? IO Interactive addressed a few things, such as being able to see which Missions had a safe in them and being able to switch your Prestige Objective so... What gives?Freelancer Mode is currently available for free for all the owners of Hitman: World of Assassination. As such, I can't be too harsh against the game mode. After all, it does accomplish its objective of bringing a huge degree of liberty for Hitman players alongside a new long-term objective that doesn't miss the point of the original game. This feels like the appropriate evolution for Hitman; it just needs to have a lot more care thrown its way, which might come in future updates.That isn't to mention that I also had my degree of fun while playing Freelancer. Sometimes, I even had more fun in this mode than in any other main modes in Hitman. Ultimately, it's free, so you can try it out yourself. I'll go back to my safehouse and do some fishing now.While Freelancer Mode introduces a lot of new elements to the table, it also brings a myriad of bugs and issues that can take away from the overall experience. The freelancer mode is by no means bad, but it definitely has issues executing its concept due to its flawed RNG and mechanics.

Hitman 3,Eric Hauter,Gaming Nexus,https://www.gamingnexus.com/Article/7259/Hitman-3/,"I cannot begin to imagine the staggering amount of work that goes into the creation of a Hitman level. In many ways, any of the stages in the new Hitman trilogy could be thought of as sprawling stages for digital interactive theater, ornate and well-rehearsed plays performed on the most imaginative and complicated sets imaginable. Or perhaps a Hitman level is the world's most complex private puppet show, with thousands of scripted marionettes performing for an audience of one.Executing just one of these levels must take a stunning amount of labor and planning. Someone (probably many people) must come up with the idea for the level’s setting. A team with architectural experience will have to design the actual buildings, corridors, and outdoor spaces with enough realism that they could actually be constructed in real life – everything must fit together and coalesce, or the illusion will be lost. Artists and designers will have to fill the spaces with objects and furnishings, rendered to scale and in the finest detail.This is the exact outfit I wore to a gala in the French Riviera last year. Just sayin'.Then someone has to create all of the character models to occupy these spaces, seemingly all completely unique, or at least distinctive enough that I’ve never spotted two that look the same. Teams of writers and animators have to give the level’s inhabitants behaviors. Why are they there, and what are they doing? How do they interact with each other? What paths do they take? What are their motivations? How will they react when they see someone in enter into a space they should not occupy?Someone has to write the script for every scenario a player can stumble across, and all of those lines of dialogue need to be recorded by voice actors. Music must be written and recorded. Every bit of contextual chatter must be considered for the way it fits into the overall scenario.And on top of all of that planning and structure, the actual gameplay must be overlaid – the objects Agent 47 can pick up, the doors that he can and cannot enter, the various “keys” that he needs to progress through a level. Add in the various planned, more obvious ways that a player could beat a level, and the preparation needed to anticipate the outliers that come up with crazed scenarios that most players would never consider. The developers have to compensate for every possible permutation and outcome, and have the entire game shift and absorb whatever whack-a-doodle plan that a player might come up with. It’s all a little mind-boggling.Phone check, homie. Phone check.Until the release of Hitman 3, I was dead wrong in my assessment of the Hitman franchise. I’ve always thought of it more as a slow-paced action game; a sort of sneaking stealth experience with Agent 47 moving from target to target, killing hundreds of people on his path to fulfill his contracts. But the truth is so much more delicious. Hitman games are actually about not killing people, or at least keeping the carnage to an absolute minimum. A perfect run through a Hitman level would see Agent 47 slipping into - and back out of - a location, never detected, leaving nothing but a few well-concealed bodies behind. At his best, Agent 47 is a ghost, and players have to resolve hundreds of crisis moments in order to keep him that way.What disguise does Agent 47 need to get through a door? Where can you get one safely? How do you draw two people apart from each other when you only need to knock out one? Where can you hide? When should you reveal yourself? How much risk is too much? The entire experience of playing Hitman is a waterfall of interesting choices, and the game continuously dangles even more enticing options in front of the player to dare them into stretching beyond their normal patterns. Why electrocute your target with spilled water on the floor when you can potentially trick them into a freezer and lock it behind them? Is it possible to push someone into a barbecue pit without anyone seeing you? Should you make a big show of choking someone out with an apricot, or simply push someone off a balcony and walk away?Ummm...looks like I'm not getting that ""No extraneous kills"" bonus.Hitman 3’s levels tend to start quietly, and can remain quiet for their entirety if you play well enough. After brief cutscenes to move the story forward (which, due to my newness with the franchise, took me a few missions to catch on to), Agent 47 is dropped into one of these amazing environments. He has a number of tools at his disposal, depending on the loadout players choose. I tended to take in a few coins for distracting chumps and a silenced pistol, but after a few runs through a level Hitman starts unlocking more interesting options. New to this installment is Agent 47’s camera, which he can use to gather information and hack through certain doors and vents.47 must make his way through the labyrinthine environments, sliding right up to people, listening to conversations, and collecting data about how he can gain access to his targets. Hitman 3 absolutely encourages players to take multiple runs at levels, with repetition helping players learn more about the intricacies of a level’s machinations.For example, I wrote in my article about Stadia’s State Share technology about the second level, Dartmoor Manor, and its optional murder mystery. I now know exactly how to solve that mystery, gain access to the file I need, and kill the target in less than 10 minutes - after taking hours wandering the level the first time, only to come up empty-handed. But, of course, 10 minutes is a long time when it comes to placement on the Hitman leaderboards, with the very best players able to resolve some of these missions in less than two. And my given solution is only one way to beat the level. There are probably 50 more ways still to be discovered. These levels are deep, and uncovering the various ways to beat them, and then executing on your plan, is where the fun lies.I would say that it's about to get real, but the realness has been happening for quite a while.The levels in Hitman 3 are so wildly varied that I am loath to reveal much more about them than I already have. These are incredibly dense and varied environments, leaving the player to wander to uncover their secrets, and discovering what the game has in store for players next is part of the fun. There is a ton of verticality in some of the levels, with Agent 47 moving up and down floors of multiple level constructs, with the primary barrier to advancement sometimes being, “How can I get to that staircase?”And at one point in the game, Hitman 3 takes off the shackles and allows Agent 47 to become the unbridled killing machine that you always knew he was. After hours of careful constraint, being able to use Hitman’s mechanics to unleash hell on a stream of hapless chumps is an amazing feeling. But then, this game is full of incredible moments, from the ridiculously good environmental dialogue to the surprises that the intricate levels kept revealing.Yes, I enjoyed the wanton slaughter of bad guys. And I got a particularly dark kick out of squishing a baddie in a grape press. But I also enjoyed hanging out near a couple of ladies at a party and learning that one of them was a talent agent, and the other was a member of a famous musical act - newly gone solo, and questioning her life decisions. This lovely little character moment was tucked off to the side of a level, with the two women chatting together in a crowd. Agent 47 could have easily brushed past them, only hearing a snippet of their conversation as he breezed by. But I stood and listened to the little drama play out, realizing that it was placed into the game for my amusement – and it might lead to a bit of info that could help me complete my mission.Should I? Can I? Would it be productive in any way?The Hitman series looks and plays amazingly well on Stadia. With a major release like this, you can pretty much play on any platform you like; there is even a cloud version being released for Nintendo Switch. Of course, VR fans will want to play on PlayStation platforms in order to take advantage of that very cool feature. But it turned out that I have the entire “World of Assasination” franchise sitting in my Stadia account with all of the accompanying expansions, so it was a no-brainer for me to play Hitman 3 on Google’s streaming platform. And of course, the State Share system just adds a bit of icing on an already very delicious cake.After years of sleeping on Hitman games, I finally get it. I understand why this series is so lauded, and why a certain subset of gamers anxiously await the next release with such rabid anticipation. When I gave the game a shot, I learned that what I thought was Call of Duty turned out to be Masterpiece Theater.If you have ever wondered about Hitman games, or if you have that one friend that keeps shrieking, “You just gotta try Hitman!” I would strongly recommend giving Hitman 3 a shot. Or go back and fire up one of the earlier entries that may be sitting in your backlog, and I guarantee that you won’t stop until you’ve played through this new entry. The talent and craftsmanship on display in this game are just too great. There is, indeed, a reason why so many people love Hitman, and I am now quite pleased to count myself among their number.* The product in this article was sent to us by the developer/company.Howdy.  My name is Eric Hauter, and I am a dad with a ton of kids.  During my non-existent spare time, I like to play a wide variety of games, including JRPGs, strategy and action games (with the occasional trip into the black hole of MMOs).

Hitman 3,Nathan Birch,Wccftech,https://wccftech.com/review/hitman-3-steady-hand-trigger/,"The mere existence of Hitman 3 sometimes feels like a minor miracle. It’s rare for each entry in a trilogy to have a different publisher, but somehow Agent 47’s latest trio of games have pulled off the improbable feat – Square Enix ditched the Hitman franchise (and its developers) back in 2017, Warner Bros. Interactive stepped in for Hitman 2, and now IO Interactive is going the self-publishing route with Hitman 3.Despite all this behind-the-scenes turmoil, IO Interactive’s execution of their “World of Assassination” trilogy has remained remarkably consistent. The studio’s dedication to seeing their vision through is certainly admirable, but were they right to stick to their guns? Does Hitman 3 deliver a proper denouement or has the trilogy’s lifeblood already been drained? Iron your red tie and grab your briefcase, it’s time to see if this one hits the mark…Hitman 3 carries on directly from the previous two entries in the trilogy, and thankfully, following the story is easier (and more worthwhile) this time around. Agent 47 and his allies Lucas Grey and Diana Burnwood seem to be close to achieving their mission of taking down the secret world-manipulating organization known as Providence, having captured their leader, The Constant, at the end of Hitman 2. Of course, things are never so easy, as the Constant escapes, leading to the usual array of twists, turns, deaths, and betrayals. This story still isn’t terribly engaging, although the game does allow Agent 47 some surprising moments of self-reflection. At times he almost comes off as human. Almost.Hitman 3’s story does significantly benefit from the introduction of actual cutscenes, rather than the static image slideshows found its predecessors. Overall, Hitman 3 sees IO Interactive come closer than ever to achieving their AAA ambitions. While character models are still a bit dated, the game’s various locations are impressively detailed and moody, featuring some of the best implementations of HDR I’ve seen to date. The game’s neon-lit Berlin and Chongqing locales are particular standouts. Despite this visual splendor, Hitman 3 runs at a buttery-smooth 60fps on PS5, albeit with a rendering resolution a bit short of native 4K.In terms of gameplay, Hitman 3 doesn’t add much in terms of core mechanics. As I’ve said before, those new to the Hitman series may initially find its reputation as a top-tier stealth franchise a bit perplexing. The games lack a lot of the features standard in other stealth series, like an actually-useful minimap or vision cones and other indicators to let you know when you’re about to be detected by enemies. In some respects, the Hitman series has more in common with classic point ‘n’ click adventure games. Surviving requires keen observation, patience, and a lot of costume changes, rather than pinpoint precision. As an action game, Hitman 3 is nothing special, but you’re not really supposed to get into fights. Action is the refuge of players who can’t figure out how to crush their targets with a chandelier or send them plunging off a ledge with a well-placed banana peel.As with its predecessors, Hitman 3’s real strength is its level design, with IO Interactive delivering easily their best lineup of new murder playgrounds yet. While Hitman 2 tried to show off with large, cluttered, sometimes-confusing locales, Hitman 3 opts for more restrained, focused stages, each of which delivers its own unique experience. For example, Dubai almost feels like an Assassin’s Creed game with plenty of dangling from drainpipes and ledges, Dartmoor is a full locked-room mystery set in a musty English manor, and Chongqing is a satisfyingly-complex Mission-Impossible-style infiltration assignment. Without giving too much away, the game ends with a particularly unique mission, that manages to blend action and stealth in a really fun and unexpected way.Hitman 3 also does an excellent job of introducing its new locations. While past Hitman games had a tendency to throw you into the lake without a paddle, each locale in this game is introduced with a meaty, well-structured story mission. These challenges do a good job of guiding the player to each location’s main points of interest while clearly demonstrating what makes them unique from a gameplay perspective. In past games, I often found locations would only “click” for me after I replayed them a few times, but that wasn’t the case here – every stage was compelling right from the get go.It should also be mentioned that despite IO Interactive taking on the heavy load of developing and publishing Hitman 3, this is actually the most polished entry in the trilogy. Unlike Hitman 2, which was laden with glitches and wonky AI behavior at launch, I can count the number of bugs I encountered in Hitman 3 on one hand. And really, most of those were more amusing than annoying. Give people power over something they care about and good things happen. Go figure.Hitman 3 is similar in scope to its predecessors, serving up a 7-or-8-hour campaign, which expands significantly if you’re dedicated to tackling the game’s missions from every angle. Multiplayer modes from Hitman 2, like Ghost Mode and Sniper Assassin, are cut or simply recycled, but they’re not particularly missed, especially when you have the option of importing all levels from Hitman 1 and 2. If you’ve been holding out on this trilogy until now, you’ve got a lot of Hitman to hit.This review was based on a PS5 copy of Hitman 3 provided by publisher IO Interactive. You can grab a copy of the game here. Hitman 3 is the definitive case for careful refinement over needless reinvention. While not that fundamentally different from its predecessors, Hitman 3 has been polished to a high sheen, offering up fantastic frictionless stealth gameplay and an eye-catching array of unique, exciting stages. At times it's felt like luck was against this trilogy, but Agent 47 would be proud of how IO Interactive’s well-laid plans have come together in the end.Subscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox© 2023 WCCF TECH INC.

Hitman 3,Jason Rodriguez,PC Invasion,https://www.pcinvasion.com/hitman-3-review-pc/,"When it comes to the Hitman franchise, I consider myself a lapsed fan. I adored the first three games in the series (the ones from the early 2000s), but I focused on other titles in the stealth-action genre after that point. Then, when Hitman (2016) and Hitman 2 (2018) came out, I decided to grab them only during sales.Still, it goes without saying that these two games reinvigorated my interest in the franchise. Sprawling levels, numerous challenges, and insane replayability hooked me like never before. Now with Hitman 3, the World of Assassination trilogy draws to a close. It’s one of my most anticipated games of 2021 and, after many hours of playing, I found that it’s the perfect way to cap off the entire experience. Hitman 3 follows Agent 47 and his allies, Lucas Grey and Diana Burnwood, as they hunt down the last members of Providence. The shadowy organization, one that rivals the ICA itself, has only a few partners left (hinted at towards the end of the previous game). However, a wrench is thrown into the plans as the Constant, also known as Anthony Edwards, seeks to consolidate his power.Truth be told, I never played the Hitman games for the narrative and storyline. They tend to be your run-of-the-mill secret agent vs. evil organization trope that’s become too commonplace especially in Hollywood flicks. However, even though the overall plot was as bland and generic as you can get, there were a few surprises given the callbacks to past incidents (and even targets) in the series.The meat and potatoes of the game, though, are its sprawling levels that offer countless ways for you to complete objectives. The first destination, Dubai, already has Agent 47 on top of the world, eliminating two key targets who are hiding inside the Hitman universe’s version of the tallest building in the world (the Burj Al-Ghazali or the Sceptre). It showcases just what you can do with the right tools and methods.You can roam around and explore the sandbox nature of the mission, taking out opponents and civilians, obtaining new disguises to turn Agent 47 into a chef, helicopter pilot, bodyguard, and so on. Do you want to prepare poisoned food for a tycoon? Sure, you can do that if you dress up as a chef. Assuming you put emetic rat poison in the dish, the character will run to the bathroom allowing you to drown him in the toilet. Alternatively, you could add lethal poison pills that will kill him as he’s having that fine meal. Heck, you could even follow the businessman to his office, then impale his eye on a scale model of the tower.Likewise, you could also follow mission stories (a feature from previous installments that makes its return). You can select from three options that provide a scripted path littered with tasks. Eventually, you’ll reach a target (or multiple ones), allowing for a quick and easy elimination. In some destinations, it’s possible to complete multiple mission stories since they pertain to different targets.Personally, one of the best mission stories I’ve ever seen occurs in Dartmoor, Hitman 3‘s second level. I won’t spoil it for you, but you’ll be in for a treat.Almost all of the mission stories are extremely creative and ingenious, and I applaud IO Interactive (IOI) for how these play out. They provide a means to explore the sandbox further, and some even lead you to new locations that you wouldn’t know were there had you been aimlessly wandering. Conversely, there are a select few objectives that are time-sensitive, too. Failing them cancels out the mission story entirely, but you can still find other ways to successfully complete the level.Speaking of sandbox exploration and the completion of objectives, Hitman 3 really shines through with the replayability it offers. You can expect more of the same, for good or ill, when it comes to these tallies.Apart from a plethora of ways you can assassinate targets, there are also challenges related to feats and discoveries. Feats tend to be related to either a mission story or an optional task you can perform (i.e., bonking three guards on their heads with soda cans or using a grape presser to dispose of a body). Likewise, discoveries focus on items or locations that you can find in levels (i.e., getting all disguises or using all possible extraction points). Interestingly, Agent 47 has a camera that can be used to hack certain terminals to open passageways. Sadly, Hitman 3 doesn’t have a full-blown photo mode though.Additionally, Hitman 3 introduces the concept of persistent shortcuts. At certain parts of the map, you might find gates, doorways, or ladders that are sealed off. If you can interact with these, the shortcuts will become available in successive playthroughs. These shortcuts open up new ways for you to reach your objectives, especially if you’re gunning for the Silent Assassin ranking or other variations (Silent Assassin, Suit Only).Completing these challenges will net you a higher mastery score, unlocking extra starting locations, concealed stashes, weapons, and gadgets. These items will be available across all of the maps, and not just those in Hitman 3. That also includes those from the two previous World of Assassination games.Given that Hitman 3 relies heavily on replayability, one of its most egregious flaws is its save system. This game still doesn’t have a quicksave function, so you’ll need to open your menu time and time again if you need to make manual saves. The manual saves are also arranged in a row instead of distinct sets depending on the destination. Moreover, I’d have to say that the autosave system is a bit unreliable to boot.Of course, we do need to talk about Hitman 3‘s progress carry-over function and Access Pass. IOI has already detailed some information about these in the game’s pre-launch guide. It’s worth adding that the Hitman Access Pass will be free for early purchasers and Hitman 2‘s levels will be free for Steam owners in due course. However, for the sake of transparency, I’d like to note that the review code we received already contained both Hitman and Hitman 2 content. As such, even though I own both games on Steam, I wasn’t prompted about an Access Pass just to play maps like Sapienza or Miami.As for the progress carry-over function, this is done via a website and an IOI account is required. Unfortunately, the website is down at the time of this writing. Although it’s expected to be available once the game launches via the Epic Games Store on January 20, this is a process that you want to do before delving further into Hitman 3. Should you do this at a later point, your progress in Hitman 3 will get overwritten.Visually, Hitman 3‘s locales are impressive and stunningly beautiful. I’m talking about the overcast skies of Dubai, the expansive gardens of Mendoza, the dingy nightclub next to a power plant in Berlin, and the cityscape of Chongqing (which had Cyberpunk 2077 vibes). With an Nvidia RTX 3080, maxed out settings for quality, and 4K UHD resolution, the game ran at a buttery-smooth 110-120 fps. The only downsides were from certain character expressions and animations during cutscenes, since they can appear too rigid and wooden. Furthermore, I didn’t experience any crashes, slowdowns, or major bugs, but I did notice a few connection issues. I’m not sure if these are related to pre-launch jitters with Hitman 3‘s servers or just my PLDT internet acting up.Now, due to the aforementioned qualms, I wouldn’t be able to do a progress carry-over since that’d wipe everything I did in Hitman 3 while reviewing and doing guides for it. My only recourse is to replay older missions once more just for the unlocks (which is a hassle). As such, my impressions in this review are solely based on Hitman 3‘s levels and content. Unfortunately, these only include six destinations/maps and related Escalation activities. I did fiddle around with Contracts mode for a bit, but Sniper Assassin mode only had the maps from Hitman 2. Don’t forget that Ghost Mode isn’t around anymore, and Elusive Targets have yet to be introduced.Still, I’d have to say that what Hitman 3 offers as part of the base game remains fairly decent. The level design, mission stories, and replayability kept me engaged all throughout. It offered so many creative ways to undertake your objectives, as well as ridiculously satisfying assassinations. All in all, Hitman 3 is truly a worthy conclusion to Agent 47’s saga and, once the progress carry-over and Access Pass woes have been ironed out, you’re looking at the most complete Hitman game ever.Although there are a few issues (namely with its save system and soon-to-be-fixed progress carry-over function), Hitman 3's mission stories, level design, and creative assassinations provide the franchise's ""greatest hits"" record. It's the perfect way to cap off Agent 47's journey.About Us
