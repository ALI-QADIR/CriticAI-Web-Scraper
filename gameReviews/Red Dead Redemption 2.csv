ThomasChen978 wants to know why a dozen bodies and a couple horse corpses are piled onto the train tracks bordering the early industrial town and New Orleans stand-in St. Denis. ""You just murdered half the village.""""No,"" I reply, ""That's us. This is us. These are our bodies.""We're on round two of growing the recursive corpse pile. My posse got the idea to jump in front of the train after a few rounds of Lasso Your Friends And Toss Them Into The Sea with a couple friendly strangers. Red Dead Redemption 2, like GTA 5, has its own bowling minigame, we explain to Chen in a roundabout way, his horror inverting into blissful awareness. Die in Red Dead Redemption 2's shared open world and you'll respawn fast enough to carry your own corpse around. The guy lines up with us. We must make it bigger. As the train comes around again, another posse tries to take us out. Chen defends us, but doesn't make it back to the tracks. He falls a few paces away, screaming. A true warrior's death. Red Dead Redemption 2 can be the biggest, dumbest videogame ball pit for impulsive children, a harrowing story about the forced dissolution of community, or simply a serene and contemplative hiking simulator. It's just about whatever you need it to be, and good at it too.Just hours before corpse-bowling I went on a solo hike through snowy forests, stepping in the long shadows cast across the snow by the rising moon. I heard the clap of a gunshot in the distance. Some wolf tracks marked the snow in the same direction. I followed them to see who won. Anytime I pay attention and look closely, RDR2 rewards my curiosity.The mind-boggling detail making up the massive world of RDR2 speaks to the creative force of a development team with an acute, obsessive dedication to realism (and all the money and time necessary to make it happen). Like how my friends' characters flinch when I fire a gun near them, how animal carcasses decompose over time, how NPCs react to a muddy or bloody outfit accordingly, how busting through a doorway scares everyone on the other side. It's hard to believe RDR2 is so deep and wide and is also a cohesive, playable thing. I already knew it from playing days worth of the console version. It's why I'm especially disappointed it debuted on PC in a somewhat busted state.For every unrehearsed multiplayer adventure, there are a couple disconnects or crashes to desktop. Rockstar's best story and characters yet intermittently filtered through a slideshow of frame hitches and freezes, finally addressed over a week after launch. RDR2, the best western game and one of the best open world games I've ever played released with enough stability issues to make it a difficult recommendation until everything is completely smoothed out.Every pretty vista is something to lose through Arthur's eyes.Red Dead Redemption 2's story mode follows the dying days of the wild west. The spreading industrial world encroaches on Arthur Morgan's small band of outlaws and social underdogs, an imperfect but loyal, loving, and self-sustaining community.Capitalism is reducing humans to their value as resources. Indigenous Americans are driven from the plains to make way for 'civilization' and commerce. Forests are brought down for lumber, the hills gutted for coal, and Morgan's chosen family is caught in the middle of it all, forced to run, assimilate, or respond with violent protest. They do all three. This is Rockstar's most serious drama yet, and it's really, really long. The story 'ends' after 40 to 50 hours if you're rushing, and then continues for another 10 to 15. Red Dead 2's main story missions are stubbornly typical Rockstar fare: ride to a destination talking all the while, do a tightly scripted albeit amusing thing, ride and chat to a final destination to finish up. Missions are often thrilling action sequences or hypnotically mundane portraits of ranch labor and trade, peppered with cutscenes, long winded bespoke animations, and excellent performances. They're just frustratingly rigid, to the point where it feels like I'm following stage directions rather than roleplaying the life of a vagabond in the old west. Step out of line in these missions and it's a failstate. In stark opposition to Red Dead Online, there's little in them that encourage players to think for themselves, each designed to serve the story foremost. The RDR2 show is a great one at least, luxuriating in the slow pace of life in the old west. It's not all life-and-death dramatics; my favorite missions involve shoveling shit, getting drunk with a friend, the resolution of old romance, and a hot air balloon ride. Working through the more rote, stringent tasks is worthwhile in the end anyway, bolstered by exceptional, ambient world-building and characterization. Side missions, minigames, small activities, and random world events—whether hunting down legendary gunslingers, catching a play, or stumbling across a woman stuck under a horse—all inform Arthur's character and the setting in subtle, enriching ways. Nested in the third act of a fully animated and voiced theatrical performance, something like 10 minutes in, it's possible to press the react button after a performer does a bit involving a telephone. Arthur will shout, ""The hell with the telephone!"" It's an optional activity, a long one, and reacting in that short window is a choice. I have to imagine most players will miss it, but it's there instead of Canned Response 1 through 3, because it's something Arthur would say, a grumpy goofball righteously set in his ways. God damn is it sad. An apocalypse that led to this. He'll write whole, actual diary entries about the 50 hour campaign, sketching memorable scenery and reflecting on the state of affairs of his chosen family, people he once knew, oscillating between hope and despair as his fortunes change. It's entirely optional reading, but a refreshingly intimate take on a traditionally masculine figure who harbors as many doubts and hopes as the next person. He'll sing to himself on lonesome rides and decry his aging body in the mirror. He'll have a rambling conversation with the horse-pinned woman as he gives her a ride to town, the two commenting on the troubles of working for rich, ungrateful men as a growing necessity. I feel it all.  Hillbillies might hold him up after making camp, a couple might attempt to rob him after inviting him over for dinner, a man with a snakebite might come stumbling out of the woods asking him to suck the poison out. These random encounters depict the brutal life on the fading frontier, as nature pushes back against the interlopers who seek to transform it. Arthur is a perfect vessel to see it through. It's because Arthur Morgan is one of the most deeply human characters I've played in a game, cruel and kind according to distinct principles carved out during a great turning point in American history. The game world, beautiful as it is, is made more beautiful and tragic in how it's propped up to play off him at every opportunity. Every pretty vista is something to lose through Arthur's eyes, cut through by power lines and train tracks, the skies and his remaining life slowly filling up with factory smoke. Just about everyone sees an unhappy ending in RDR2, too. It's a story I might not retain every moment of, but I won't forget its brutal arc or the man in the middle of it all. God damn is it sad. An apocalypse that led to this. I'm desperately trying to get an artful picture of the silhouette of my horse shitting against the moon.Assuming you're capable of running it at higher settings, RDR2's greatest strength is in how it exquisitely renders the old west setting on PC, drawing more attention to the finer details that make it up. It's one of the best looking games I've seen, and a rare experience that justifies a new GPU or CPU. Improved draw distances and added vegetation detail at greater distances make some vistas look photographic. Long shadows transform walks or rides between locations from chores to lovely nature tours. Blemishes from animal attacks, bullet holes, rain, mud, or blood mark up clothes in sharp detail thanks to much higher resolution textures, telling little stories about what your friends have been up to. A new photo mode makes it easy to share those moments of awe. As the kind of player who goes on hikes in RDR2 just for the sights and sounds, it's a vital feature. I'm desperately trying to get an artful picture of the silhouette of my horse shitting against the moon, yet another self-appointed goal afforded by this ridiculously massive, intricate game. With a 2080, i9-9900K, and 32GB of RAM, I can run RDR2 on mostly ultra settings with a few resource-intensive settings turned down or switched off completely. But some hardware combinations are proving troublesome for RDR2, leading to random crashes in certain APIs and, up until a recent hotfix, major hitching issues for some 4-core CPUs.For all that good data, check out our initial benchmarks and performance analysis. I couldn't spend more than an hour playing without crashing to desktop during the first weekend, though switching from DX12 (which gives me better framerates) back to Vulkan stabilized things. Sometimes the UI bugs out and I can't choose a select or purchase option, the map fails to appear, or I get unexpectedly punted from the game servers. The graphics settings are almost too numerous as well, and perhaps misleading. In our testing, only a handful of settings affected performance more than 1-2 percent. The big remainders, MSAA, volumetric lighting, and parallax occlusion mapping among them, affect performance from 5 to 25 percent. Most of them don't make big visual differences anyway and are best left off. The way the settings are presented feels underdeveloped: a massive list with vague presets that require tinkering to get RDR2 running at a satisfying framerate. It's daunting. The PC should be the best place to play, not the best place to play, eventually, after a few patches. A shame for a game this good-looking. There wasn't much actual fishing to be had in our fishing trip, but I'll take a memorable moment of stupidity, a cute little pocket of drama and action, over any amount of trout.Just as in the singleplayer mode, in Red Dead Online I can reasonably make up my own goals and see them through. Problem is, it's fundamentally hamstrung by a frustrating multiplayer leveling system that locks basic tools and cosmetics behind tall XP requirements that can take hours, maybe days, to meet. The alternative is spending gold, the premium currency, to unlock items and clothes immediately. A fishing pole isn't available until level 14. A damn fishing pole in The Outdoor Recreation Game. It's not a great look and a terrible way to get players invested. But once I waded through the bureaucracy of progression systems and filled out a basic suite of tools (fishing rod, bow, varmint rifle, nice hat, etc), Red Dead Online opened up wide. I've largely ignored the traditional matchmaking modes like gunfights and horse races, cheap thrills I'd rather play much better versions of in different games, opting to make my own fun. It's led some of the most inventive, serene, surreal, and outright dumb adventures I've had in some time.Chris Livingston and I set out to go fishing, just because. Fish are pocket change if sold to butchers and cooking them restores health and stamina, but, like the best bits of RDR2, fishing is just fun for the sake of it. A nice virtual day on the water partaking in the philosopher's sport. Sounds nice. After tossing an innocent into the water for his boat, we get curious if we can hitch a ride on one of the big shipping boats in the distance, uncertain whether it's a physical object or the just videogame scenery to be seen but not touched. We take off from Turkey Island (so many turkeys), and row like hell. Our tiny boat scrapes the side of the big sucker and starts taking on water. Chris makes a daring leap and just grabs the edge of the deck. I flounder in the swift current—it's all over, man—while Chris calls out from the side of the large vessel, disappearing around the bend. There wasn't much actual fishing to be had in our fishing trip, but I'll take a memorable moment of stupidity, a cute little pocket of drama and action, over any amount of trout. RDR2's open world is ripe with that kind of playfulness, completely borne from our curiosities and impulses and largely supported by the simulation.I once waltzed into the middle of a gunfight in Blackwater and carried player corpses to the church graveyard, one by one. Some posses caught on and attended the 'burials' of their friends. A corpse thanked me for the gesture. Later, in an extended streak of criminal activity, my posse and I captured another player and rather than murder them on the spot, we rode to the swamps and threw them in gator infested waters. I got the idea from doing the same thing to a friend.On a less absurd note, I set myself the ongoing goal of earning enough money strictly from hunting to purchase cold weather gear and a fine rifle. I'm going to hike into the mountains and find the finest grizzly bear hide there is, becoming a wizened mountain man adorned with animal skins with a beard that nearly touches the floor.In the meantime, I'm stopping city-wide gunfights by running through the streets and calling for a parley. I'm taking part in eight-player barroom brawls. I'm living the life of a normal cowboy in the best cowboy game there is. I just hope it cleans up soon. Check out PC Gamer's list of the best open world games for more massive adventures.Red Dead Redemption 2's stark, slow depiction of America's fading frontier is a monumental work straining against stubborn mission design and stability problems.

Red Dead Redemption 2,Martin Robinson,Eurogamer,https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-10-25-red-dead-redemption-2-review,"O.K. Corral.As Rockstar gives Red Dead Redemption 2 a belated release on PC, we're republishing our original review of its grand western adventure. We'll have more on the PC version in the coming days from Digital Foundry, and if you're playing and need a hand head to our extensive Red Dead Redemption 2 walkthrough.It's one of those cute ironies that Rockstar Games, most famous for the virtual cityscapes of the Grand Theft Auto series, would create what many consider its masterpiece when working with the dust and dirt of the wilds. When it launched in 2010, the open-world western Red Dead Redemption was as refreshing as a chill blast of mountain air: a bucolic, melancholy counterpoint to the madcap urban caricature of GTA. And so it's fitting that the sequel, Red Dead Redemption 2, makes its greatest strides in its world.This is a vast, staggeringly detailed open world. You could get out a virtual ruler to proclaim it Rockstar's biggest yet, or count every single NPC, line of dialogue, rock, tree and outhouse and say it's the developer's densest, but I'll leave all that for someone else. What I will say is that this is Rockstar's broadest canvas since Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, quite possibly even more so, with what no longer feels like a take on a single city or state but practically an entire country.There are the heights of Amorino, hidden under knee-deep snow, the flats of New Hanover, the bayous of Lemoyne, the opulent metropolis of Saint Denis, and the clipped greens of West Elizabeth. It's a map that offers Rockstar's take on the sights and sounds of late 19th-century New Orleans through to South Carolina, from Indiana to Iowa and plenty more besides - a forged snapshot of an America forever lost that is utterly convincing.It's those thousands of small details that do the convincing: the way the oil shimmers on the surface of the water that sits outside the factories of chilly Annesburg, the cold stare and silence that meets you when you drag your scruffy frame through the saloon doors of the more cultured Saint Denis, the lamps that flicker across the midnight quiet in the town of Rhodes. It's the way it'll make a keen botanist of you, admiring the Spanish moss that hangs from the bald cypress of the bayou, the pines up in the mountains or the white oaks down on the plains, all shifting beautifully in the breeze. Even before you get to the fauna that lies underneath, it's a world that feels alive.It's in the way you'll see that weather build overhead, thick crops of cloud rolling in over the expanse of country - from most vantage points the horizon is thrillingly distant, the sky so vast above it all - while meticulously studied cloud formations swirl together. The craft that's gone into Red Dead Redemption 2's world - painstaking, expensive and arguably at too great a human cost - is evident in every frame.And it's enriched by an artistry and technical excellence that's just as evident. If the original Red Dead Redemption leaned heavily on celluloid depictions of the west, then its follow-up is much more painterly in tone. The landscapes of 19th-century artist Albert Bierstadt are one noted influence, those thick oils impressively mirrored in Red Dead Redemption 2's own textures; in the dawn or dusk of certain days, there's a richness to the light that would make Turner blush, veering, at times, towards a certain impressionism in the diffuse light.Red Dead Redemption 2 is a world of vivid textures, too. There's the thick mud you brawl in along the main strip of Valentine, the town where your adventures start, the coarse leather of a coat you've crafted from the wildlife you're free to hunt down, or just the taut hide of your horse that ferries you from place to place. It's a world you have a tangible place in, thanks to Rockstar's use once again of Euphoria animation technology that sees you stumble, sprint and collide with objects in the world, grounding you in it. Impressively - and somewhat cruelly - that extends to your horse now too, an aggressive trot into a tree trunk proving just as grisly as any of GTA's more violent moments. That physicality, brilliantly, extends to your inventory system. Kill a deer and to take it back to your camp you'll sling it on the back of your horse for the ride home, watching its soft belly jostle in time with the canter. The same philosophy extends to the weapons you take with you, picked up from your horse and slung over your back. It's a smart way of grounding you even further in Red Dead Redemption 2's world, even if - in what becomes something of a recurring theme - that elegance isn't met by the deeper design, where an overly fussy rotary selection system has you all fingers and thumbs when performing even the most perfunctory task. That philosophy can be effective, though. Red Dead Redemption 2's world leaves an impact on your avatar, the pointedly gritty wilds muddying your horse's hide and your clothes until you either brush your ride down and pay to use a bathhouse or incur the disgust and disdain of those around you. That dirt will clog up your arsenal as well, requiring you to clean your guns lest they lose their potency. It's part of that same busywork - very engaging busywork, mind - in which you can maintain the length of your hair and beard or let it grow unruly, can choose to pomade it in the morning or cover it with your favourite hat (which you may well lose in a fight if you're not careful - though thankfully you can pick up anyone else's in its place), or you can get thin or fat depending on whether you overindulge in the food you're required to eat in order to maintain your stamina core. This is a neat idea - and another with tinges of the maximalist Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas - that's again undone by muddiness of execution. In Red Dead Redemption 2, you have health and endurance that are governed by cores, which dictate how rapidly radial meters fill, which are also there for your horse and pop up on your mini-map intermittently and... if I sound confused, it's because after over 60 hours I still am, and those systems remain fuzzy throughout. Perhaps it's just the game's proximity to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, where similar systems are crystal clear and hard-baked into the experience (in another similarity that's fluffed here, your choice of clothing has an impact - if you're not dressed appropriately in cold climates, for example, you'll shiver and your meters will take a hit). Red Dead Redemption 2's take seems inelegant, inconsequential and - both thankfully and damningly - easy to ignore. But Red Dead Redemption 2 wears its RPG trappings lightly, and wilfully so - it's happy, you sense, to take on a little fuzziness in order to sidestep fussiness, streamlining systems in order to keep you grounded in its world. That same approach is evident in your encounters - you can interact with every single non-player character, though your verbs are limited to simple interactions such as 'greet', 'callout', 'antagonise' or 'defuse'. There's always 'shoot' too, of course - something which is a bit too easy to do given a context-sensitive control system that, bewilderingly and fatally for some poor bystanders, occasionally has the button you draw your weapon with as the very same which you use to pull the trigger. In a game of often impeccable detail, it's a strange oversight. Red Dead Redemption 2's best stories, as ever in a Rockstar game, are to be found in the margins, the very best to be scribbled yourself. Sometimes that's just picking up on environmental details and connecting the dots - the gold prospector that sifts through their haul in the middle of a river, or maybe something even more sinister as you pick up the trail of a serial killer. Or maybe it's losing yourself in an epic hunt - there are almost 200 species here, each lovingly realised for you to shoot and skin and scalp - or stopping to help a stranger in one of the seemingly endless incidental encounters. Rockstar has its own tale that it wants to tell here, of course, and here there's a disconnect, and a friction, from a game that wants to impress that upon you - sometimes aggressively, boorishly so. Red Dead Redemption 2 is set in 1899, some 12 years before the original and when the American west was properly wild. If the first game was about how one outlaw dealt with being outmoded and pushed to extinction as 20th-century civilisation took hold and the country was tamed, then the sequel shows the process of that taming, in all its violence and turmoil. You're Arthur Morgan, veteran of the same group of outlaws that you hunt down as John Marston in the original game, chased across the land as they teeter on the edge of their own extinction. Morgan is a less fleshed-out creation than John Marston, though that's possibly by design - those small choices you're afforded enable you to build your own reading of him. Whether you push him towards sainthood or villainy, he's never quite as compelling, either, and as a result it's hard to get a grasp on what exactly Red Dead Redemption 2 is about. Whereas the first game was about the taming of the wilds, and of one man trying to tame himself alongside them, by drawing the clock back 10 years the sequel feels like a story in stasis.Partly it's about family, and loyalty, and that is backed up by one of Red Dead Redemption 2's most effective systems. Your gang's camp - which shifts across the map along with the story - is an upgradeable base, where you can invest as little or as much as you please, those choices reflected not only in appearances but also in how others react to you. There's a beautiful loop, when you're first establishing it, of heading out into the wilds for your own adventures then heading back with the spoils slung over the back of your horse ready to be cut up and placed in a stew for your comrades, and it's all told with those same outstanding incidentals you find elsewhere. One night there might be a party that breaks out when your gang is flourishing; the next morning, you'll wake up to a sea of heavy heads and hangovers. Such revelry is responsible for Red Dead Redemption 2's standout mission, a night on the tiles that shows how Rockstar's narrative skills have taken an unlikely yet highly welcome influence; it's the first use of in-game jump cuts I can recall since Blendo Games' 30 Flights of Loving, and when matched with Rockstar's own bawdy style and lavish production it's every bit as effective as you hoped it would be. Elsewhere, though, Red Dead Redemption 2 struggles to find a place for you as it tells its own story; the main missions stick too rigidly to the aging template of heading out to a point while characters chat amongst themselves, and when you get there, too often all you're allowed to do is perform a handful of quick-time events and engage in the inevitable shootout. Red Dead Redemption was always the more cinematic cousin to Grand Theft Auto, though it's only in the sequel that that cinema threatens to get in the way. There's an influence from Naughty Dog in the main missions that, when it pays off, can be spectacular - an explosive train chase, or a bar brawl told with exquisitely heavy animations - but one that can just as readily come apart at the seams. In a game that otherwise promises freedom, it's doubly frustrating to fail a mission for not being able to find the marks to trigger the next cinematic, or to reach your target in a chase only for it to magically teleport out of reach. Maybe that disappointment is down to how Morgan's story isn't the measure of Marston's, and how Red Dead Redemption 2 is too eager to fall back on the same story beats and ape the same moments. One direct lift, towards the second half of the game, simply underlines how this sequel lacks the grace of its predecessor, in the tale it tells at least. The 60 hours it takes to see Morgan's story through to the end can be a slog, then, but it's the next 60 where you'll find Red Dead Redemption 2's real grace, when you're away from the straitjacket of Rockstar's own story, where the world can breathe and its true potential is realised (and where, in an act of incredible generosity, that world opens up).  It's been eight years since the last Red Dead Redemption, and five since the release of Grand Theft Auto 5 - time that you can see and feel in every delicately crafted inch of a game of this scope and scale, yet time in which we've been spoilt by the likes of The Witcher 3 and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Rockstar's writers can't quite match the humanity and purpose of the former, nor can its designers match the integrity of the latter.It offers something else besides, though: a richness, detail and technical prowess that is breathtaking, and peerless. Is this Rockstar's greatest game, a new masterpiece alongside the original? There are one too many caveats, and one too many flaws at its heart, to leave me totally convinced. Is this its richest, most beautiful open world? Of that there's not a single doubt.You're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!

Find out more about our reviews policy.There’s no way to say the following without sounding wildly definitive, so here goes…. Red Dead Redemption 2 is the best looking video game of all time. Yes, EVER. And that includes Uncharted 4 (opens in new tab). It’s also the best game of the past five years. Compare this Wild West epic to GTA 3’s blocky Liberty City and its cast of fugly thugs you probably kneecapped on a tiny TV 17 years ago, and the evolution is astounding. At times, it’s scarcely believable how good Rockstar’s latest sandbox looks and feels. Not counting GTA 5 (opens in new tab)’s remaster, this is the first game the studio has properly released this console generation. Unsurprisingly, in the years since the Los Santos sensation launched, Rockstar has built up a wealth of things to say. As such, RDR2 is a game of big themes and even bigger ideas. The evils of creeping capitalism. Corrupt regimes. The loss of long-held beliefs. With its contextual conversations, where its outlaw lead can either greet or antagonise hundreds of bespoke NPCs, the game also tries to move open-worlds forward. Here, your main interactions often involve swapping pleasantries (or devastating, old timey disses), while significant portions of the main story involve quiet, peaceful character-building. Compared to the wanton carousel of slaughter so many other sandboxes choose to ride, RDR2’s more thoughtful, less trigger-happy approach feels like a progressive step. Although that said, you still end up shooting hundreds of dudes. Don’t worry, most of ‘em deserve it. Playing on Xbox One X at 4K, this frontier fable isn’t just incredibly sharp, it boasts the most impressive lighting and weather effects around. Wait until you see a soupy morning mist coat the game’s southerly plantation fields or get caught in a screen-shaking thunderstorm, then try to disagree. If you’re lucky enough to own a high-end 4K TV, the visual splendour RDR2 routinely spits out is a match for even the most cutting-edge games on PC; remarkable seeing as this is running on (slightly) ageing consoles, not an insanely expensive graphics card. Even if you’re ‘only’ playing at 1080p on a standard Xbox One or PS4, this supremely pretty open-world is filled with incredible environments and super expressive character models. A prequel and companion piece to 2010’s Red Dead Redemption, the story of criminal cowboy Arthur Morgan unfolds like one of Sergio Leone’s sombre yet knowingly playful Spaghetti Westerns. Of course, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly lasts a couple of hours, not upwards of 70. A twisting tale of torn loyalties and outdated ideals, it features several returning (albeit younger) characters from its predecessor, including a fresh-faced John Marston, who has a pleasingly crucial role in Arthur’s journey. Mournful, melancholy, majestic, the game’s sweeping tale of out-of-their-depth outlaws plays out across the backdrop of a rapidly changing U.S. heartland in the dying days of the 19th century. 23 essential Red Dead Redemption 2 tips (opens in new tab) you'll need to know before you playBefore wading further into the Old West weeds to tell you exactly why RDR2 is the best game of the last half decade, it’s difficult to entirely separate the adventure from the recent accusations levelled at Rockstar Games. Much of the conversation surrounding the launch of the open-world epic has focused on claims of a caustic culture of 100-hour working weeks (opens in new tab). Whatever the truth of the matter, this is a complex issue that could spill deep into this review and beyond. RDR2 bears all the the hallmarks of an intensive, eight-year-long production schedule; a labour of love (and perhaps less positive aspects of triple-A development) which nevertheless stands a cut above its contemporaries. As of right now, the cowboy classic represents the current pinnacle of video game design. This is an all-time great: a masterpiece that deserves to be mentioned alongside Ocarina of Time, Half-Life 2, Metal Gear Solid 3, Skyrim, and most recently, The Witcher 3 (opens in new tab).RDR2 is a ready-made anecdote generator. Sit a dozen people down with the game and I’ll bet you Clint Eastwood’s last Fistful of Dollars every last one would see scenarios totally individual to their playthrough. Rockstar’s extraordinary open-world is as wide as it is deep. This is an adventure so stuffed full of amazing emergent moments, when the end credits roll after a full week of captivating, criminal play, there are enough incredible memories to fill ten lesser games. ""Red Dead Redemption 2 is a ready-made anecdote generator""You might see a hungry gator pull a screeching boar into the bayou abyss of Lemoyne’s richly detailed swamplands (think Rockstar’s take on an old timey Louisiana). You’ll enter into countless slow-mo Dead Eye shootouts using Arthur’s impactful array of guns – some battles improve even further with RDR2’s optional, awesome first-person mode. You may fall for a horse (then quickly lasso the filly to make it your mount) after watching it joyfully roll around the flooded grasslands of Grizzlies West. Your Arthur might even be treated to a free jacket from one of the game’s general stores when a stranger rewards you for that time you saved their life near the snaking rivers of Cumberland Falls. Said good (totally random) deed most likely involved Morgan sucking snake venom out of the guy’s thigh. Now let's never speak of the serpent slurping incident again.The world these emergent activities occur in is astounding. Forget GTA 5’s Blaine County, or the blustery beauty of The Witcher 3’s fantasy kingdom: RDR2 has the most impressive map you’ve ever explored. Honestly, it’s astonishing. Far bigger than GTA’s fictional California – and remember, you can’t zip around Morgan’s Western world in a helicopter – it spans snow-covered mountain regions, dense swamps, dramatic oil fields lifted straight from There Will Be Blood, and even a sizeable New Orleans-inspired city. There’s also a secret, sprawling area folk will lose their minds over.How to unlock Red Dead Redemption 2 fast travel (opens in new tab)When it comes to scripted story missions, there’s no other open-world – well, perhaps GTA 5 – that comes close to matching the sheer quality of Redemption 2’s core campaign quests. Over 60-odd hours of sheriff-shooting, bank-robbing, bridge-blowing action, there’s only one generic, cookie cutter ‘tail the target’ objective that springs to mind. The majority of Arthur’s law-breaking missions all centre on strong story-building. Most involve constantly inventive tasks, including unlikely costume changes, outrageous modes of transport, or challenges as varied as mingling at a cocktail ball to teaching a young boy how to fish. Considering there are 104 main missions – for context, Franklin, Michael and Trevor’s Los Santos caper ‘merely’ has 79 – such variety is even more impressive. Story-wise, this is perhaps the boldest triple-A game ever made. Arthur’s tale undergoes the least predictable, most ambitious twists you could ever imagine. If you’re sensitive to very minor spoilers, you might want to step away until the next paragraph. Still here? Lovely. Then let’s just say the final 15 hour epilogue (yup, you read that right) is nothing short of astonishing. Wholly surprising and thoughtfully mature, it’s an example of the sort of high caliber storytelling we all deserve in 2018, but few big budget games have delivered since 2013’s The Last of Us.""It’s an example of the sort of high caliber storytelling we all deserve in 2018"" There are also a ridiculous amount of detailed side systems in RDR2, and every last one is worth your time. Engrossing animal hunts involve tracking scent trails before targeting a critter’s vitals organs, and they’re all more engaging and in-depth than every Cabela’s game combined. Upgrading your gang camp’s food, medicine and ammo tents also adds a tactical management element to the action, while fully fledged weapons-crafting and meters affecting Arthur’s health, hunger and stamina ensure you have to keep your outlaw’s belly full and fitness up if he’s to stay at his sharpshooting best. RDR2 is so detailed, even Morgan’s hair and beard grow in real(ish) time. If you don’t want Arthur ending up like some Wild West yeti, treat your cowpoke to regular trips to one of the game’s barbers. In a cute nod to CJ from GTA: San Andreas, the outlaw also loses or gains weight if he eats too little or too much – don’t worry, the results are less cartoonishly exaggerated than shoving Clucking Bell bucket meals down Carl's throat. Couple this with extensive wardrobe options, which let you tweak everything from your antihero’s shirts and vests, to even the spurs on his boots, and few open-worlds give you this much agency over your character. A word – alright, several gushing sentences – on the music. Woody Jackson has done a sensational job on the soundtrack. The composer has scored every Rockstar title since the original Redemption, and this is his most aurally arousing work yet. The last game was celebrated for several wonderfully judged music moments, the most famous being Marston’s ride into Mexico to Jose Gonzalez’s ‘Far Away’. While the prequel may not have a song that’s as note-perfect as that haunting melody, the tracks that accompany the story’s key moments all work beautifully. As for general background music, Jackson’s score is both electrifying and eclectic. Somehow, it can dovetail between shredding your nerves during a terrifying cave assault involving cannibals, and perking up a scene where your cowboy chums celebrate some successful DIY by downing all the whiskey. ""Some may struggle with its initial blast of uncompromising pacing""Are there criticisms? Of course. For large parts of the game, there’s no fast-travel, which is bound to rub time-poor people up the wrong way. The first act is also downright slow, especially placed next to GTA 5’s barnburner opening. Some may struggle with this initial blast of uncompromising pacing, though when the full map open ups, the wait ultimately proves more than worth it. The early camp-building options are also jettisoned too soon, and certain missions can involve annoying, insta-fail objectives. And while the epilogue is generally brilliant, the last half hour lacks the brilliantly lean gut punch of the first Redemption’s finale.Just how good is Red Dead Redemption 2? Over the past few years, I’d argue the only games that deserve to be considered at this same ultra elite level are GTA 5, Metal Gear Solid 5, and The Witcher 3. This is a stone cold 5/5 classic that combines brilliant writing – Rockstar’s Houser brothers deliver another affecting, scythe-sharp script – amazing tech, and one of the most boldly structured plots to ever grace a triple-A title. The story is so well told, you’ll emotionally invest more in a horse during one crucial scene than you did even for Kratos in this year’s stellar God of War (opens in new tab) revival. If you only buy one game this year, it absolutely has to be this wondrous Wild West quest. Reviewed on Xbox One X, and we'd certainly advose playing it on something from our best gaming TV  guide.David has worked for Future under many guises, including for GamesRadar+ and the Official Xbox Magazine.

Red Dead Redemption 2,Matt Bertz,Game Informer,https://www.gameinformer.com/review/red-dead-redemption-ii/an-open-world-western-for-the-ages-0,"The world of Red Dead Redemption II is defined by violence, both in its passive and active forms. Bandits roam the highways, pilfering from the wealthy and poor alike. Predators mercilessly hunt and kill their prey in the unforgiving wilderness. Men of industry don’t blink twice stepping over the bodies of the sick and the dead to realize their economic ambitions. In this primordial stew of fear and savagery, the outlaw Van der Linde gang feels right at home. Led by the charismatic and resourceful Dutch van der Linde, this gang doesn’t think of itself as part of the problem. They support each other, primarily rob from the greed-lined pockets of the rich, and share the pioneer goal of buying a remote piece of land and settling down together far from the freedom-crushing existence of society. But as power structures shift and the unrelenting progress of government and technology swallow the untamed West, their particular sort of violence is speeding toward extinction.If you’ve played Red Dead Redemption, you already know how this tragic story ends. But watching the fabric that holds the gang together fray and unravel as the law chases them across the country over the course of Red Dead Redemption II is riveting nonetheless. Once-vibrant camp nights filled with campfire songs and revelry are slowly replaced by suffocating discontent. Rival factions develop among the gang, and watching Dutch van der Linde transition from a relatively principled leader to an unhinged psychopath is one of the most vivid and raw portraits of villainy I’ve seen. Standing in the center of this savage storm is Arthur Morgan, Dutch’s righthand man. His gruff exterior and icy stare paint the picture of the prototypical outlaw, but underneath this gunslinger veneer is a reflective man struggling with his own mortality and the wayward morality of the gang’s increasingly desperate actions. He still feels more at home among thieves, liars, and murderers than he does with honest civilians, but he increasingly contemplates the real cost of their heinous actions. Player actions determine which of four ways Morgan’s character arc ends, but regardless of your decisions, his intimate struggle with the life he chose serves as the questioning heart of this epic Western experience. Using the word “epic” to describe Red Dead Redemption II feels understated. This is the biggest and most cohesive adventure Rockstar Games has ever created. A rare harmony exists between the narrative, gameplay systems, open world, and mission design. Their interdependent nature makes it tough to talk at any length about each individual element without venturing into spoiler territory; the fashion in which these elements mingle and coalesce over the course of the journey is interesting to witness.  The story missions alone will likely take you 80-plus hours to complete. Surprisingly for a game of this length, Red Dead Redemption II only occasionally succumbs to repetition or boredom – primarily due to restrictions with when and where you can fast travel. As the gang is chased across the land by law, rival gangs, and the Pinkerton agency, Rockstar crafts a healthy diversity of settings. By the time you hang up your spurs, you will have robbed small-town banks, hijacked trains, executed jailbreaks, clashed with organized crime outfits, and challenged titans of industry. Sometimes you ride with the entire gang, other times the action revolves around only a few key actors, giving Rockstar time to flesh out Morgan’s compatriots. This includes getting to know Red Dead Redemption protagonist John Marston even better. Each gang member brings something unique to the table and most are likable, which gives the inevitable dissolution of their alliances a tragic weight. Violence is the only currency that applies across all the regions Arthur Morgan and the Van der Linde gang traverse, so Red Dead Redemption II rarely leaves the comfort of wanton bloodshed, perhaps to a fault. That’s not to say the combat isn’t fun (it is), but it feels refreshing whenever Rockstar lets a mission play out without resorting to violent encounters, and I wish there were more quiet moments sprinkled throughout the story. The world is vibrant enough to sustain long sections where every mission doesn’t devolve into gunfights. Going back to other open-world games after playing Red Dead Redemption II won’t be easy; this is unequivocally the most well-crafted and fully realized open world in video games. The attention to detail Rockstar poured into creating this bloody interpretation of a historical period is remarkable. The wide expanses of wilderness feel alive thanks to an unrivaled dynamic weather system, ambient sound effects, and the most ambitious ecology of flora and fauna ever seen in games. You can spend hundreds of hours exploring the varied and gorgeous terrain, and Rockstar packs the game with side objectives to keep you busy. Hunting legendary animals, collecting plants for the crafting system, and exploring for dinosaur bones will keep you occupied on the frontier. Some of the best moments occur when you stumble onto a remote property and meet the colorful (and sometimes revolting) humans who call it home. When you head into town, Rockstar’s meticulous craftsmanship gets even more impressive. Each of the many towns and cities has its own character and personality, with the bustling New Orleans facsimile Saint Denis being the crown jewel. The cities are packed with things to do, from taking in a vaudeville show and getting your photo taken to meeting a memorable cast of strangers and perusing the intricately detailed shops. You can dive into a catalog at gun shops and general stores, or walk right up to the shelves and grab what you need. All the exteriors and interiors in the game look authentic to the time period and make you feel like you are visiting a place lost in time. Even the civilian population is remarkable – you can interact with each person you come across, and I rarely heard a repeated line of dialogue outside of some random encounters outside the city. New strangers continually pop up offering interesting side missions as well. Rockstar Games has outdone itself again with Red Dead Redemption II. The up-close portrayal of the outlaw Van der Linde gang’s unraveling is a compelling companion story that blends seamlessly with the original game, and depth and breadth of the open world is a technical triumph that every gamer should experience.

Red Dead Redemption 2,Chris Plante,Polygon,https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2018/10/25/18021034/red-dead-redemption-2-review,"Filed under:Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of the weirdest, most ambitious and confounding big-budget games of this decadeEarly in Red Dead Redemption 2, I meet a has-been gunslinger crumpled over a grimy bar in a livestock town on the outer fringe of the American West. He goes by Boy Calloway, but the codger’s a long way from that persona geographically, temporally, mentally. Aside Calloway sits his would-be biographer, in need of my services. Unable to squeeze a cogent anecdote from this puckered lemon, the author requests that I locate the living members of Calloway’s crew to gather stories of his former greatness, or strike dead those who would dispute the book’s “authenticity.” The assignment — like much of the game —  is optional, but I take it, figuring I’ll meet some legendary cowboys and gunslingers. That’s not quite what happens. Red Dead Redemption 2 is a prequel to the 2010 open-world Western, but I hesitate to say that it shares the genre. Like Calloway’s quest, the game isn’t quite what it claims to be. Set almost entirely within the American South two decades after Reconstruction, it tells two parallel stories: one, a fish-out-of-water journey featuring good-hearted criminal Arthur Morgan and his colleagues, all members of a notorious gang; the other, about the hollowness of mythmaking in the American West. It’s the latest entry in the trend of games that seem paradoxically crafted with love and a potent dose of self-hatred.Safe to say, Red Dead Redemption 2 is the weirdest, slowest, most confounding big-budget game of this decade — if not any decade.Polygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences. When we award the Polygon Recommends badge, it’s because we believe the recipient is uniquely thought-provoking, entertaining, inventive, or fun — and worth fitting into your schedule. If you want curated lists of our favorite media, check out What to Play and What to Watch.I’ve spent dozens of hours in Arthur’s boots, and for most of them, he behaves like just another member of an ensemble cast, offering a window into the day-to-day life of the men and women who have bought into the promise of their leader, Dutch van der Linde. They share stories about the old days that Calloway’s biographer would turn into a pulpy Western, but if a golden era ever really took place, it has unquestionably passed by the time this plot begins — a truth Arthur struggles to make amends with.Following a mysteriously botched job led by Dutch that ended with the death of an innocent bystander, the notorious Van der Linde Gang is moving eastward, outside the game’s equivalent of Texas and into the American South. Real states, cities and even politicians have alternate, fictional names here, with the creators taking inspiration from a moment but not recreating it precisely. I meet Arthur as he guides the gang through a tough Ozark winter. In no small part thanks to Arthur’s modest co-leadership, the Van der Linde Gang — composed of men, women and a child — survives the elements and the rival O’Driscoll gang, establishes a camp, and tries to recreate its Robin Hood-esque lifestyle of righteous crime in pursuit of financial security and freedom from the law. Rockstar Games’ Grand Theft Auto series has focused largely on men who adopt a life of crime in pursuit of the unattainable American dream, but the members of Dutch’s gang largely seem to have been wronged by the nation and want freedom from it. Every step of their journey is taken toward that one big job that can solve all their problems.Red Dead Redemption 2 takes its sweet country time getting to the heists. Before you rob a bank, you must learn to care for your health, gang, horse, camp and grooming. None of this is particularly tedious, some of it is quite fun, but most of it plays out like eating vegetables before the red meat is served. And I love veggies, but every sight and sound is hyping the main course. Stagecoaches, trains and camp upgrades allow for Arthur to travel large swaths of land, but riding to the train, then from the train to my destination, often felt just as laborious as taking the straight shot on horseback. Rockstar’s developers have designed a stunning, elevated take on the rural United States’ natural beauties, and they’ll be damned if you don’t see most of it trotting from point A to B and back again.Once Arthur learns how to be a functioning grown-up, after six or so hours, the game (and the world) loosens up. He spends the thrust of each day making money and trouble in pursuit of the grand escape to somewhere better, though whether that’s back in the West or outside the States depends on the people with whom he’s conspiring.13 things to know about Red Dead Redemption 2 before jumping inRed Dead Redemption 2 has a central storyline, plotted on a map of the game’s world in yellow dots. But the world is brimming with additional paths Arthur can choose to take along the way, themselves branching in various directions. Most are unmarked, and their events unfold in medias res. Similar moments appeared in the original Red Dead Redemption, but they’re dwarfed by the depth, variety and interactivity happening here. While searching for a former member of Calloway’s gang, I come across a man who is being attacked by wolves. I scare the animals away with a shot in the air and offer the man medicine — medicine that, I realize as I offer it, can hardly treat his mangled leg. He bleeds out, cursing me.Around the 20-hour mark — roughly one-third into the game — the story sets a stride, and I begin to establish my own rhythm alongside it. Days pass slowly in the game’s universe, and I spend most of them doing a mix of hunting for pelts and meat that will help me upgrade my clothes and feed the camp; running a couple of side missions to get to know the crew; and maybe completing a story mission to move everything else along, or perhaps taking a trip to town to gamble, collect a bounty poster or just see what will happen on the main drag. I have my guns and a lasso, items to sell, money to buy whatever I need, and — new to the series — the option to chat with anyone.Rockstar has the hubris to create not just another open world paired with a laundry list of activities, but also a simulation that binds it together. When it works, it’s astonishing, affecting and unintentionally funny in the way real life can be. As I try to defuse a robbery, I notice my horse taking a massive and seemingly endless dump just behind me. A bunch of code is directing the hundreds of animals and people around this world, but where most video game characters and creatures feel as if they’re repeating the same path into oblivion, this world does just enough to feel like a live space — at least until you push against the edges.Generally, the pillars propping up the simulation can’t be seen, but sometimes — for clarity — the designers opt for standard video game iconography. Arthur has “cores” that symbolize his health, stamina, and ability to slow time and shoot a bunch of people in a jiffy. They sit on the screen like icons on a car dashboard, flashing when they must be tended to with food, drink or remedies. Gorge on food to keep health up, and Arthur gains weight. Go heavy on the liquor, and he gets drunk. There’s a balance to what you consume, so chewing tobacco might help your aim in the short term, but hurt it long-term. It’s intimidating at first, until I begin to ignore the icons and just feed my pet Arthur before and after each mission. Treating him like a Tamagotchi that swallowed a bag of gravel makes the systems all but disappear.Arthur can engage with every character in Red Dead Redemption 2 by greeting them, antagonizing them or robbing them. It’s a limited means of communication, but an upgrade from so many action games that begin and end most conversations with a bullet. The trouble with presenting a fully interactive world is that, when the internal logic fails, the unrealistic reaction is all the more jarring. I don’t expect to interact with the generic crowds in Red Dead’s contemporaries, like Assassin’s Creed or Far Cry, but giving me the option to converse with every individual dramatically changes what I assume the game will allow me to do.Early in Red Dead Redemption 2, a captured rival, bound to a post, begs me for food. I pick up food, but I see no option to feed him. I can eat, which upsets him. But when I toss the food on the ground, he doesn’t react. Here’s another example: A crowd watches a public hanging. After the execution, the crowd disperses, and I find the victim’s mother weeping in the mud. I want to console her, but for whatever reason, the game won’t let me “greet” or “antagonize” the distraught mother. The only option it gives me is to pull a gun on her. While the game’s creators invite players to think of engagement beyond their weapon, it’s frustrating how few opportunities I have had to show empathy or compassion.A few years ago, I spoke with someone who worked on the Microsoft Kinect, and I keep returning to a point they made about designing for innovation. If something new works 99 percent of the time, that sounds great. But say the object in question is a phone, and the user checks the device 100 times a day; that means the device fails once a day. Suddenly, that extra 1 percent is unforgivable. The phone ceases to feel like a natural appendage, and becomes more like a tool.When the systems in Red Dead Redemption 2 fail — or don’t live up to their promise — it changes how I play. Initially, I tried to spark my own stories with the people in the world. Now, I respond to the world, rather than hoping it might respond to me. The exception to this rule, somewhat, is communicating and cooperating with Arthur’s fellow gang members. Each member of the Van der Linde Gang has their own backstory and ambitions, which are communicated if you chat with them around the campfire or over a meal. I join them on everything from fishing trips to home invasions, where they share insight into their lives. Hours of conversations can be had in the camp, and I am happy with how the game’s conclusion rewards those conversations. Each member of the crew fits into the larger plot; getting to know them makes later dramatic turns all the richer.The people of color in the gang carry the additional burden of introducing Arthur — and, by proxy, the player — to the reality of how America treats them. Where white members of the gang concern themselves only with the next heist, black and Native American members worry as much about their own survival.Arthur is impossibly naïve, to the point that Lenny, a black member of the gang, must explain that plantation owners would consider lynching him for the color of his skin. Charles, who is Native American, helps Arthur hunt and acts as a liaison with a tribe that, he explains, has been shuffled from reservation to reservation as the government caters to oil barons. I don’t believe Charles’ tribe is ever identified, though he works with Arthur to help the Wapiti, a fictional tribe that Rockstar PR told me is “not modelled on a specific tribe,” but is a “mix of Native American peoples who have been pushed together by the changes being forced across the entire region.” The game’s mashing together of real-world people, locations and groups into single entities produces story beats that range from benign to confused to insensitive and harmful.Characters regularly speak about their experiences with bigotry, but the game mostly keeps the mechanisms of white supremacy at arm’s length. At one point, Arthur takes Lenny drinking, only for his friend to get mobbed by the cops. But the next time he sees Lenny, all is well. Lenny reflects on the night at the saloon the way a frat boy flippantly jokes about an evening of memories erased by blackout drinking. A couple of times, I come across a mob of Ku Klux Klan members holding a cross burning in the woods at night. On one occasion, they light themselves on fire. On another, a few members are crushed beneath the weight of the large cross. The face of white supremacy is played for slapstick comedy, betraying the reality of a mechanism of hate that killed entire communities in acts of terror. In the real Gilded Age American South, the white hoods concealed politicians, law enforcement officers and business owners. Here, they cover up Abbott and Costello.The story’s final chapter is an exception, in which Arthur manages to be a participant in oppression and grotesque manipulation, while also being absolved of his role in the matter every step of the way. In this manner, Arthur’s journey is a lot like that of Forrest Gump. He stumbles through some of American history’s biggest and ugliest sins, oblivious to the scope of their evil, yet angelic in how he always finds himself on the inherent side of good. The commentary on the American South and the mythological Western genre works much better when Red Dead Redemption 2 focuses on entitlement and power. At the story’s midpoint, Dutch tries to leverage the conflict between two plantation owners in the game’s equivalent of rural Louisiana. They’re vile and richly drawn monsters, and there’s a certain pleasure in gradually dismantling their lives. Nearly every Rockstar game has lampooned cults, using them as a blunt metaphor for the American obsession with righteous salvation. But with Dutch’s gang, Rockstar has for the first time really captured a cult’s appeal and danger. Like so many fanatical leaders, Dutch exploits the insecurities and desires of his followers, promising them exactly what they want. He uses a Machiavellian approach to justify increasingly horrific missions. And he never stops punting. It’s always one more job till the big payday that will turn everything around. He’s a huckster, and the parallels to modern politics are clear, despite Rockstar showing — at least in this respect — an uncommon restraint. A positive, meta side effect of Dutch’s strategic messiness is how failure makes for memorable and unpredictable missions. In previous Rockstar games, a series of missions anticipated a big heist. In Red Dead Redemption 2, a conversation at camp can be interrupted as Arthur is given a gun and a mask and a plan with little notice and less foresight.The game is set at the turn of the 20th century, but missions play out like the jobs in Michael Mann’s iconic heist film Heat (a film that Rockstar revisits for inspiration in game after game). Arthur and a selection of gang members enter a bank or train or business with a few guns, an outside factor interferes with the plan, and they must react on the fly to stay alive and get away with whatever they can. The gunplay and combat isn’t dramatically improved from Grand Theft Auto 5, which is to say, in 2018, it’s serviceable. The more that missions focus on the busy work of a heist rather than on nailing headshots, the better.With each heist attempt, the region responds to the gang like an infection. The group targets plantation owners and heirs, power brokers, robber barons, and a pre-Progressive Era federal government, but a couple dozen folks eking out a life on the fringes of a small trading town can’t compete with hulking institutions powered by an unlimited supply of money and weapons, soldiers, police and mercenaries. In short order, their simplistic “Wild West philosophy” gets crushed beneath a time and a place that’s too complex for them to comprehend, let alone compete with.The game’s writers set a foundation that feels as though it could use individual characters to launch a further-reaching story about cultural systems, like the books of James Baldwin, the TV shows of David Simon and the films of director Steve McQueen. But ultimately, the story is too sentimental, and the game too loyal to the video game story trajectory, in which missions become bigger and more explosive, rather than more critical and introspective. The final acts’ required missions vacillate between various styles of genre fiction, zipping from Uncharted-like action set-pieces to a horror showdown with inbred families.This week, reporting at Kotaku has highlighted the human cost of making Red Dead Redemption 2, with anonymous sources citing pressure to work intense amounts of overtime for weeks, months or even years. In New York magazine, Rockstar co-founder and Red Dead co-writer Dan Houser himself discussed working 100-hour weeks, a statement he quickly walked back. Then, in a British GQ profile, Houser said that he and Sam Houser, his brother and business partner, talk about how “games are still magical. It’s like they’re made by elves. You turn on the screen and it’s just this world that exists on TV. I think you gain something by not knowing how they’re made. As much as we might lose something in terms of people’s respect for what we do, their enjoyment of what we do is enhanced. Which is probably more important.”As the game spirals in its final chapters — in tone, in ambition, in message — I can feel the circumstance of its creation. This isn’t the magic of elves; it’s the creative hodgepodge of thousands of individuals.On the one hand, this is damning. Scale hinders specificity, and a story about the tragedy of the American South demands specificity. It’s hard to even gauge if Red Dead Redemption 2 achieves its own goals, because by the end, it appears to be a bit of everything: a violent shooter, a cracking heist flick, a meditation on mortality, a high school American history class.On the other hand, even with the tonal messiness, the game routinely centers itself around a valuable philosophy: The golden myths of the Wild West era, the stories of dime-store Westerns, are just that — myths. And that allows for it to be something for everybody, even when that something isn’t always for me. At its best, the story breaks away from the Western genre and plays like a cross between a heist movie, a domestic drama and a political thriller. At its worst, it’s a buddy action comedy. Mercifully, it manages to be more of the former than the latter.After Red Dead Redemption 2’s story concludes, a huge epilogue begins, and the game’s already gargantuan map grows even larger. I’m eager to dig into this postgame, where it seems I’ll be free to focus on taking in the beautiful, meticulously simulated world, rather than hurling myself into the middle of it. The coda reminds me of a trend that has benefited other open-world games through expansions — a smaller, more straightforward tale that makes use of this big, expensive world without having to justify every inch of its existence.The original Red Dead Redemption was about the future: how the colonizers of the West themselves couldn’t escape the encroachment of U.S. law, that the state would claim monopoly on violence. Red Dead Redemption 2 is about the past — how it was never what it seemed; how it can be weaponized against the present; that reality is nasty, knotted and often deliberately obscured by the oppressors.From the start, Calloway’s biographer plans a hagiography not of the intoxicated man at the bar in the middle of nowhere, but of a gunslinger who never existed and a place fondly reimagined. Along my journey, I make time to visit his gang members. I don’t find heroes; I just find folks hustling out a life in a country that has no interest in whether they live or die, unless it’s published in a page-turner. I can talk with them or antagonize them or shoot them. It doesn’t really matter. Calloway’s book will end up the same. And it will sell a million copies.

   on November 7, 2019 at 3:22PM PSTEditor's note: Red Dead Redemption 2 is now out on PC, and we spent 10 hours with the game on its new platform. Despite consistent game crashes on launch day, we were able to get the game running stably, and two updates were issued by Rockstar in response to the issues.Our experience has been largely positive. A roster of graphics options and the ability to play with a high frame rate helps the PC version separate itself from its console counterparts, given you have high-end specs; Red Dead 2 is a demanding game. It was already visually stunning on Xbox One X and PS4 Pro, and the same is true in our case for PC. While some rare visual bugs appeared, they were inconsequential to the experience. Red Dead 2's control scheme has transitioned well to keyboard and mouse, too, though there are a few kinks to work around. Gamepad support is seamless.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Red Dead Redemption 2 Video ReviewRed Dead 2 remains a superb game and a gripping experience with gameplay systems that connect you to the world and the characters that embody it; you can read more in our original review from 2018 below. For more detail on the PC version specifically, be sure to read our full thoughts on Red Dead Redemption 2 as a PC port. -- Michael Higham, November 7, 2019Red Dead Redemption 2 is a game about consequences where you have only the illusion of choice. Yes, there are some decisions to be made, and those decisions will shape your character and the world around you. But some of the most disastrous choices were made for you before the game even begins, leaving you to deal with the fallout. And because it's a prequel to Red Dead Redemption, you also (probably) know how the story ends. All that's left is discovering what happens in between and making the most of it. To that end, you fight against the repetitive nature of missions, frequent moral dilemmas, and the inconvenience of doing what's right. For the most part, the frustration that tension can cause is also what makes the story impactful, and when it all comes together, your effort is not wasted.At the beginning of Red Dead Redemption 2, the Van der Linde gang is already on the decline we know from the previous game is coming. After a heist gone wrong in Blackwater, they're on the run, down a few members, and on the verge of capture, starvation, and succumbing to a snowstorm. There are familiar faces--Red Dead Redemption protagonist John Marston chief among them--as well as new ones. As senior member Arthur Morgan, you're in the privileged position of being Dutch Van der Linde's right hand, privy to his machinations and included in the most important outings. Once the gang escapes the storm and settles into a temporary campsite, you're also put in charge of the camp's finances, meaning you pick out all the upgrades and supplies. If Dutch is the center of the gang, Arthur is adjacent to all its vital parts at once, and that gives you a lot of power.With that power, you're encouraged to do as you see fit and at your own pace. A lengthy series of story missions early on introduces you to some of the ways you can spend your time, including hunting, fishing, horse-rearing, and robbery. There are a lot of systems, and covering the basics takes several hours. While they're not so cleverly disguised as to not feel like tutorials, the actual learning is paced well in its integration with the story, and the missions also acquaint you with the characters and the surrounding area. For example, the fishing ""tutorial"" has you taking young Jack Marston out for the day, since John is not exactly great at fatherhood. Jack is pure and sweet--and incredibly vulnerable to all the gang's wrongdoings--and the mission is memorable for it.In addition to the mechanics of various activities, you're also presented with a few elements of semi-realism you need to contend with. Mainly, you need to eat to refill your health, stamina, and Dead Eye ability ""cores,"" which deplete over time. Eating too much or too little results in weight changes and stat debuffs. Eating itself isn't a problem, and neither is maintaining cores in general, but eating enough to maintain an average weight is intrusive; despite experimenting with what and how often I ate, I couldn't get Arthur out of the underweight range, and eating any more frequently would be too time-consuming to justify. You don't have to sleep (though you can to pass time and refill your cores), and surviving hot or cold temperatures comes down to choosing the right outfit from your item wheel, so managing your weight sticks out as superfluous rather than conducive to immersion.Limited fast travel options are the better-implemented side of Red Dead 2's realism, perhaps counterintuitively. There's next to no fast travel at the beginning and few methods in general, so you have to rely on your horse to get around. It can be slow, but there's no shortage of things to do and see along the way. Chance encounters are plentiful and frequently interesting; you might find a stranger in need of a ride to town or a snake bite victim who needs someone to suck the venom out of their wound. You can stumble upon a grotesque murder scene that sets you entirely off-track, or you can ignore someone in danger and just keep riding. And just as you can decide to rob or kill most anyone, you'll also run into people who will do the same to you. Even the longest rides aren't wasted time, and it's hard not to feel like you're missing something if you do opt for fast travel.Red Dead Redemption 2's version of America is vast and wide open, stretching from snowy mountains and the Great Plains down to the original game's New Austin in the southwest. Further to the east is the Louisiana-inspired Deep South, which is still feeling the effects of the Civil War after nearly 40 years. There's a distinct shift when traveling from region to region; as grassy hillsides become alligator-filled swamps, Union veterans give way to angry Confederate holdouts, and good intentions and casual racism turn into desperation and outright bigotry. The variety makes the world feel rich, and it both reacts to you and changes independently of your involvement; new buildings will go up as time goes on, and some of the people you talk to will remember you long after you first interacted with them (for better or worse).Incidental moments as you explore make up a large part of the morality system, in which you gain and lose honor based on your actions. ""Good"" morals are relative--you're a gang member, after all--but generally, it's more honorable to punch up rather than down. Helping an underdog, even if they're an escaped convict and even if you need to kill some cops or robbers to do it, can net you good guy points. In these situations, it's easier to be noble than a true outlaw. Committing a dishonorable crime is hard to do undetected, even in remote locations, and usually requires you to track down and threaten a witness, run and hide from the law, or pay a bounty down the line. While you'll earn money more quickly doing ""bad"" things, high honor gets you a pretty discount at shops, and you'll make good money either way through story missions.In many ways, you're nudged toward playing a ""good"" Arthur. The gang members he's closest to from the beginning are the more righteous, principled ones who are motivated by loyalty and a desire to help others, while he insults, argues with, and generally reacts negatively to those who are hot-headed and vicious. The most rotten of them is Micah, who's so easy to hate that it's hard not to follow Arthur's lead and take the higher road. Unlocking camp upgrades like one-way fast travel and better supplies also essentially forces you into being honorable; although everyone donates, you have to invest hundreds of dollars yourself if you want to afford anything, and that automatically gets you a ton of honor points whether you like it or not.One of the best, most understated details in the game is Arthur's journal, in which he recaps big events as well as random people you've met and more mundane, everyday things. He sketches places you go, doodles the plants and animals you find, and writes out thoughts he barely speaks out loud. The journal changes with your level of honor, but at least for a relatively honorable Arthur, the pages are filled with concerns and existential crises--inner turmoil over being either good or evil, for instance--that make you want to see him become a better person.Like any good prequel, there's an incredible amount of tension in knowing what happens without knowing exactly how.It's a lot harder to feel like a good guy when doing the main story missions, though. Arthur, along with nearly everyone else, is loyal to the gang first and foremost. This means following Dutch into trouble, busting friends out of jail, and committing a number of robberies in the interest of getting money for the gang. Even if you're trying your hardest to be good, you'll inevitably slaughter entire towns in mandatory story missions--stealth and non-lethal takedowns aren't always an option, and the snappy auto-lock aim makes shootouts a far easier option anyway. The dissonance is frustrating to play through in the moment, but it's incredibly important to Arthur's arc as well as your understanding of the gang as a whole. To say any more would venture into spoiler territory.That extends to the structure of story missions, which start to get predictable around halfway through the game. It's not that they're boring--the opposite is true, actually, and you see a lot of action from beat to beat. But after a while, a pattern emerges, and it's easy to figure out how any given heist or raid is going to unfold. This too becomes frustrating, partially because you often have no way of significantly affecting the outcome despite any decision-making power you thought you might have had. But your weariness is also Arthur's, and that's crucial. The mid-game drags in service of the narrative, which only becomes apparent much later. There's also enough variety between missions and free-roam exploration to prevent it from dragging to the point of being a chore to play.Like any good prequel, there's an incredible amount of tension in knowing what happens without knowing exactly how. If you played Red Dead Redemption, you know who survives and as a result who probably won't make it to the end of the game. Even during the slower parts, you're waiting for betrayals and injuries and other events you've only vaguely heard mention of before. You're waiting for characters to reveal their true selves, and watching as everything unravels is riveting and heartbreaking if you know what's to come.You can still enjoy the story in its own right without that background knowledge, though. Some of Red Dead Redemption 2's best moments have almost no relation to its predecessor. One mission takes you to a women's suffrage rally, and a painful side mission has you facing a woman whose husband you killed and life you ruined. The new characters are among the best, too; Sadie Adler is a personal favorite for reasons I won't spoil. Another, a young black man in the gang named Lenny, mentions how the Southerners treat him a little differently; Arthur says that he hasn't noticed anything weird, to which Lenny replies, ""All respect, Mr. Morgan, you wouldn't notice.""Generally, Red Dead 2 tackles pertinent issues of the era with care. Rather than defining any of its characters by the bigotry they may experience, it allows them the room to be well-rounded individuals while still not ignoring that things like racism and sexism exist. One arc focuses squarely on a very serious issue, and here, the lack of real choice in the story's direction--and your resulting involvement in what transpires--will likely make you uncomfortable in a powerful way.While Red Dead Redemption was mostly focused on John Marston's story, Red Dead 2 is about the entire Van der Linde gang--as a community, as an idea, and as the death rattle of the Wild West. It is about Arthur, too, but as the lens through which you view the gang, his very personal, very messy story supports a larger tale. Some frustrating systems and a predictable mission structure end up serving that story well, though it does take patience to get through them and understand why. Red Dead Redemption 2 is an excellent prequel, but it's also an emotional, thought-provoking story in its own right, and it's a world that is hard to leave when it's done.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"

        Privacy PolicyenterRed Dead Redemption 2 offers up an astoundingly engrossing world that's remarkably easy to get lost in.Editor's note: This review was originally conducted in a podcast format, available as a video above or right here as an audio file. A summary of the review follows. Red Dead Redemption 2 is, in many ways, a pretty staggering video game. First and foremost, it is staggering in its scope. An open-world game in the grand tradition of Rockstar's lengthy catalogue in the genre, RDR2 offers up an Old West world that is massive in scale, teeming with life and activity, and astoundingly, exhaustingly detailed. It tells an uneven, but highly enjoyable tale set 12 years before the events of the first game, and largely affords its large cast of characters far more opportunities to endear themselves to the player than any other Rockstar production I've ever played. In the 60-plus hours I spent poking through every corner of RDR2's world, I constantly found myself getting lost in both the myriad activities it provides, and the simple pleasures of walking through its diverse and gorgeously rendered environments.And as I worked my way through this staggering game, I couldn't help but repeatedly think about the staggering amount of work that went into creating the game. I probably would have had that thought irrespective of recent events, just by virtue of how unusually polished the whole experience feels. But the recent reporting on conditions at Rockstar's various studios in the lead-up RDR2 undoubtedly intensified those thoughts. No matter how transfixed I became by the ""magic"" of what this game does, I found it difficult to shake the sensation that everything I was experiencing came at unreasonable expense.The story follows the adventures of Arthur Morgan, right-hand man to charismatic gang leader Dutch van der Linde. Players of the original Red Dead will recall that this gang is the one previous protagonist John Marston originated from. At this stage of history, Arthur, Dutch and crew are on the run following a failed job in the town of Blackwater. Throughout the story, the gang exists in a transient state. Moving from state to state, the crew finds itself mixed up in a wide variety of misadventures as they try to regather themselves and pull together the funds they need to finally disappear. As Arthur, you are essentially the gang's fixer. In addition to participating in the various robberies and related crimes that take place throughout the game, you'll also find yourself in charge of the gang's camp, a bustling communal space where you collect quests, manage resources, and just exist alongside the various personalities that encapsulate the gang.This is the best aspect of the game, not necessarily from any gameplay perspective, but rather in terms of overall immersion in the world. One of RDR2's greatest strengths is the lengths it goes to in order to make its world feel like it is breathing on its own. Other Rockstar open world games have largely focused on centering the player in every way. Everything is typically built like a playground, chock full of activities that exist at the forefront, while the various NPCs just sort of mill around. Here, the various cities, camps, and wild areas all feel like they are moving along at a lifelike pace. When you're in your gang camp, you'll see people doing chores, reading, playing games, and engaging in conversations that have nothing in particular to do with whatever quest you're about to embark upon. These personalities, these people, are the core of what makes RDR 2 go. There is a humanity to these characters that Rockstar games don't typically seem all that invested in portraying.The story itself does not always do right by its cast of characters, but its primary tale of Arthur's journey through the gang's final days is an extremely compelling one. The performance of Rob Clark as Arthur is a big part of that, but the writing is strong too. His motives are understandable, and his internal conflicts are thoughtfully portrayed throughout the campaign. Many of the other personalities around him are loud and cartoonish in ways you'd expect, but few of them feel like pure caricature. Where the writing does falter, it's largely around the margins of that core story. Its attempts at delving deeper into conflict between indigenous people and the US military feel too steeped in cliche to say anything of note, some of the various stranger missions peppered throughout the world are blandly obnoxious in the way the worst GTA missions can be, and there is more than a little seemingly unexamined irony in the story repeatedly making villains out of tyrannical capitalists and demagogues who work their people half to death entirely to their own benefit.The most gobsmacking thing about RDR2 is how all its various systems and characters are weaved into its world. Right from the jump, the game drops numerous tutorials about hunting, crafting, shooting, horse bonding, and a million other things both big and small. Some of these systems are more important than others, but there are opportunities to engage with them on a near constant basis. All these pieces, all these systems, are remarkably blended into the game world. The sheer number of mechanisms all working behind the scenes are exhausting enough to think about, but the way Rockstar has obscured all those gears grinding in the background is its most impressive trick. In most open world games it's not long before you can start seeing the seams. If not outright bugs and glitches--which RDR2 has, albeit in much smaller volume than you might expect--you'll eventually come upon quests and activities that feel like they've been copied from somewhere else in the game. Think about Far Cry's various towers, Assassin's Creed Odyssey's bandit camps and timed missions. Very little of RDR2 has that sensation. From the biggest missions right down to the smallest interactions, all of this stuff feels like it was constructed individually. I was inspired to do missions that I might have ignored in a more repetitive game because each one had its own distinct thing going on. I almost never thought of ticking off checkboxes as I went.You sense this everywhere you go in RDR2. I spent long stretches in the towns and cities following NPCs around to see where they went, what they interacted with. When out in the countryside, I constantly found myself standing still as I watched wildlife scurry around, and the wind blow through the grass and trees. This is a slow game, one where huge stretches involve little more than riding or walking from place to place, drinking in the atmosphere that surrounds you. This is a sensation I expect some players will bristle at. Arthur moves at a methodical pace, and while there are some sections where the controls feel flat out unintuitive or unresponsive, more often it's just a matter of letting Arthur's animations play out. And there are so many of them. So many. If you want to pick up a gun, skin an animal, even open a damn drawer, you'll have to watch him go through a realistically, if slowly paced animation for it. Hell, every major character in this game has their own distinctive way of moving through the world. It is a ludicrous amount of animation. Ludicrous.Details like this are easy to fixate on, especially when considering the amount of work poured into it. No one detail is by itself remarkable, but all these little details, these exhaustively rendered things, overwhelm the senses from the beginning and never really let up. The thing of it is, though, Red Dead Redemption 2 would still have been a pretty remarkable game without all these little details. They impress, no doubt, but knowing what we know about how Rockstar put people to work to make all those little things go, it's understandable to question whether it was necessarily worth all of that effort. In Kotaku's most recent reporting on the company's work culture, there's an anecdote at the beginning describing the way the game reframes the camera into a letterboxed shot every time it shifts from gameplay to a cutscene. This was apparently decided upon very late in the development cycle, and required members of the cinematics team to put in numerous overtime hours to rework. Does this particular feature look cool? Totally. Would I ever have noticed it wasn't there had they opted not to put their employees through a great deal of extra work to make this happen? Absolutely not.This is what it ultimately comes down to with Red Dead Redemption 2. It is an incredible achievement in open world gaming, an intricate machine that disguises its machinery better than just about anything else that's come before. In addition to its lengthy and engrossing campaign, it delivers moments of emergent storytelling more compelling than anything I can ever remember playing. Graphically and aurally, it is top-to-bottom stunning. And all that came at an expense of labor that, while in no way unusual for an industry steeped in a culture of endless crunch and burnout, nonetheless cannot be dismissed. How do you reconcile those two things? Do you boycott the game? Do you buy it to support the people who worked the hardest on it? I do not have that answer for you. I'm not sure anyone does at this stage. What I can say is that Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of the best games I've ever played, and alongside the accolades the quality of its production richly deserves, it should always be noted what the circumstances were for those tasked with producing it. That is the asterisk this brilliant game should bear for as long as people feel like talking about it. The people who developed Red Dead Redemption 2--both credited and uncredited--should rightfully feel proud of all they have accomplished. Likewise, they should be afforded the opportunity to continue making games under circumstances more cognizant of, and beneficial to, their livelihoods going forward.The CHAMP and Jan are here to deliver news on The Last of Us Part 1 PC port, EA layoffs, PSVR2 reports, and more!© 2023 GIANT BOMB, A FANDOM COMPANY.

Red Dead Redemption 2,Kirk Hamilton,Kotaku,https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-the-kotaku-review-1829984369,"From tip to tail, Red Dead Redemption 2 is a profound, glorious downer. It is the rare blockbuster video game that seeks to move players not through empowering gameplay and jubilant heroics, but by relentlessly forcing them to confront decay and despair. It has no heroes, only flawed men and women fighting viciously to survive in a world that seems destined to destroy them.It is both an exhilarating glimpse into the future of entertainment and a stubborn torch bearer for an old-fashioned kind of video game design. It is a remarkable work of game development and, possibly, a turning point in how we remark upon the work of game development. It is amazing; it is overwhelming. It is a lot, and also, it is a whole, whole lot.Rockstar Games’ new open-world western opus is exhaustively detailed and exhaustingly beautiful, a mammoth construction of which every nook and cranny has been polished to an unnerving shimmer. It is a stirring tribute to our world’s natural beauty, and a grim acknowledgment of our own starring role in its destruction. It tells a worthy and affecting story that weaves dozens of character-driven narrative threads into an epic tapestry across many miles and almost as many months. When the sun sets and the tale has been told, it leaves players with a virtual wild-west playground so convincingly rendered and filled with surprises that it seems boundless.$70 off these best-in-class wireless headphonesGizmodo reviewed them and declared them to be “annoyingly incredible.""It is defiantly slow-paced, exuberantly unfun, and wholly unconcerned with catering to the needs or wants of its players. It is also captivating, poignant, and at times shockingly entertaining. It moves with the clumsy heaviness of a 19th century locomotive, but like that locomotive becomes unstoppable once it builds up a head of steam. Whether intentionally or not, its tale of failure and doom reflects the tribulations of its own creation, as a charismatic and self-deluded leader tries ever more desperately to convince his underlings to follow him off a cliff. Paradise awaits, he promises. Just push a little bit further; sacrifice a little bit more; hang in there a little bit longer.Such a masterful artistic and technical achievement, at what cost? So many hours of overtime crunch, so many hundreds of names in the credits, so many resources—financial and human—expended, for what? What was the collective vision that drove this endeavor, and what gave so many people the will to complete it? Was it all worth it in the end?After 70 hours with Red Dead Redemption 2, I have some thoughts on those questions, though I do not find my answers satisfactory or conclusive. What I can say for sure is that the sheer scale of this creation—the scale of effort required to create it, yes, but also the scale of the thing itself, and the scale of its achievement—will ensure that those questions linger for years to come.Red Dead Redemption 2 is a follow-up to Red Dead Redemption. Let’s just start there, with the most basic and true thing that can be said of this game. Yet even that laughably obvious statement contains more meaning than it might first seem, because the new game is so spiritually connected with its predecessor. It nestles so neatly with the 2010 game that the two could have been concurrently conceived. It takes the same characters, narrative themes, and game design ideas introduced in the original and refines, elaborates, and improves on them all. Yet the two are more than separate links in a chain of iteration; just as often, they are complementary halves of a whole.While new and improved in terms of design and execution, Red Dead 2 is narratively a prequel. The year is 1899, a decade before the events of the first game. Again we take control of a steely-eyed gunslinger in a wide-open, abstracted version of the American West. Again we are given free rein to explore a vast open world however we please. Again we meet a cast of colorful characters, and again we watch those characters contemplate the cost of human progress and yearn for the half-remembered freedoms of a mythic, wild past. Again we ride our horse across forests and deserts and plains; again we shoot and stab and decapitate untold scores of people. Again we can lasso a dude off the back of his horse, tie him up, and throw him off a cliff.Our hero this time around is a weathered slab of handsome named Arthur Morgan. He’s a taciturn type who looks like Chris Pine cosplaying the Marlboro Man, and a respected lieutenant in the notorious Van der Linde gang. Arthur was taken in by the gang as a kid and raised on violence, but is, of course, blessed with an antihero’s requisite softer, thoughtful side. He’ll kill a man for looking at him wrong, but he’s oh so affectionate with his horse. He’ll beat an unarmed debtor nearly to death at the behest of a colleague, but he sketches so beautifully in his journal.At first Arthur struck me as deliberately unremarkable, another grumbling white-guy tabula rasa onto which I was meant to project my own identity. By the story’s end, I had come to see him as a character in his own right, and a fine one at that. Actor Roger Clark brings Arthur to life with uncommon confidence and consistency, aided by a sophisticated mix of performance-capture wizardry, top-shelf animation and character artistry, and exceptional writing. Each new trial he survives peels back a layer from his grizzled exterior, gradually revealing him to be as vulnerable, sad, and lost as the rest of us.Arthur may be the story’s protagonist, but Red Dead Redemption 2 is an ensemble drama. The Van der Linde gang is more than just another Pekinpah-esque clutch of scoundrels on horseback; it’s a community, a mobile encampment consisting of about 20 men, women, and children, each with their own story, desires, and role. There are villains and psychopaths, drunks and miscreants, and also dreamers, runaways, and lost souls just looking to survive. Each character has their own chances to shine, particularly for players who take the time to get to know them all. From the cook to the layabout to the loan shark, each has become real to me in a way fictional characters rarely do.At the head of the table sits Dutch van der Linde, as complex and fascinating a villain as I’ve met in a video game. Benjamin Byron Davis plays the boss man perfectly, imagining Dutch as a constantly concerned, watery-eyed killer. He just cares so much, he is doing everything he can, his voice is perpetually on the edge of cracking out of concern. Not concern for himself, mind, but for you, and for all the other members of this family of which he is the patriarch. It’s all bullshit, of course. Dutch is a coward and a fool, and all the more dangerous due to his capacity for self-deception. He’s the kind of man who would murder you in your sleep, then quietly weep over your corpse. You will never know how much it hurt him to hurt you.The name “Dutch van der Linde” should ring an ominous bell for anyone who played 2010’s Red Dead Redemption and remembers how it ends. Because Red Dead 2 is a prequel, those familiar with its predecessor have the benefit of knowing how the saga will conclude. (If you missed the first game or it’s been a while, I recommend watching my colleague Tim Rogers’ excellent recap video.) That knowledge is indeed a benefit, to the point that I will outline many of the first game’s broad strokes (including spoilers!) in this review. My familiarity with the original greatly helped me appreciate the many ways the sequel encircles and elaborates upon its other, earlier half.We know that the gang will eventually fall apart; we know that Dutch will lose his way and his mind. We know that John Marston, seen in this sequel as a younger, greener version of the man we played as in the first game, will one day be forced to hunt down and kill his surviving compatriots, including Dutch. We know that John will die, redeemed, while protecting his family. And we know that John’s son Jack is doomed to take up his father’s mantle of outlaw and gunslinger. Red Dead Redemption 2 busies itself with showing how things got to that point. Our foreknowledge adds considerably to the sequel’s already pervasive sense of foreboding, and routinely pays off in often subtle, occasionally thrilling, ways.Things look grim from the start. The gang is hiding out in the mountains, on the run from the law after a botched bank robbery left them penniless, down a few men, and with a price on all their heads. After surviving a brutal early spring in the snow, Dutch, Arthur, and the rest of the crew set about rebuilding a new encampment in the green meadows near the town of Valentine. “Rebuilding” really means robbing and looting, of course, and things inevitably escalate. The gang’s antics eventually bring the law down on them, forcing them to relocate yet again. Thus the narrative finds its structure, driven by the wearying rhythms of escalation, confrontation, and relocation. The caravan is driven east—yes, east—through grasslands and plantations, to swamps, cities, and beyond.Each time they move, Dutch promises that things will be different. This time, they’ll find their peaceful paradise and settle down. If they can just get some money, of course. If they can just pull off one big score. You understand, don’t you? What would you have him do? His lies become increasingly transparent the more emphatically he tells them. Dutch is selling the dream of an “unspoiled paradise” without acknowledging that he and his gang spoil everything they touch. By the end, his hypocrisy has become sickening, and the many ways Arthur and his fellow gang members wrestle with and justify their continued allegiance to Dutch undergird some of Red Dead 2’s most striking and believable drama.Red Dead Redemption 2 is set in a version of America that is both specific and abstracted. Characters routinely speak of real places like New York City, Boston, and California, but the actual locations in the game are broadly drawn stand-ins. “The Grizzlies” are basically the Rocky Mountains, the state of “Lemoyne” is more or less Louisiana, and the bustling city of “Saint Denis” is based on New Orleans. There are no real historical figures to meet or talk with in this game, though it is still clearly the result of copious research and attention to period accuracy.As with the first Red Dead, the world’s fictional duality puts the story in a gently abstracted space that allows the writers to comment on American history without worrying overmuch about historical accuracy. Were Red Dead Redemption 2 loaded with cheap satire and eye-rolling commentary, that approach would come across as a frustrating bit of ass-covering. Fortunately, thanks to the game’s strong script, it instead frees the game up to paint in strokes broad enough to capture the oppressive corruption that continues to be one of our nation’s defining aspects.Time and again I was struck by how seriously this game’s writers took their characters, themes, and subject matter. Abstract or no, Red Dead 2’s America is still a nation reeling from the Civil War, where women are not allowed to vote, and where Native Americans and their cultures are being systematically eradicated. Everything in the main narrative is treated with appropriate weight and humanity, and never did I encounter a lapse into the sort of haphazard satire and “everyone sucks” cop-outs embraced—by some of the same writers!—in Rockstar’s depressingly misanthropic Grand Theft Auto series.“Go east, young man.”Open World Human Nature SimulatorEngrossing, unbelievably detailed world; well-written script full of carefully considered characters; technically astonishing audio-visual production; brilliant acting; very good horses. Fudgy controls and animation-based interactions can be frustrating; under-explains its interlocking systems to a degree that can sometimes be confusing.Rockstar GamesPS4 (played on Pro), Xbox OneOctober 26Completed the story in around 64 hours, spent another six doing optional content. Robbed, pillaged, protected the innocent, bounty hunted, played poker, got drunk, skinned animals, and stole horses. Dressed up real fancy. Shaved my beard. Drove a train. Rowed a boat. Still have a ton of additional side stuff to explore.These characters are all people, and they’re dealing with things people dealt with at the turn of the century in America. Their lives were hard, and most of their stories ended badly. That’s just how it went. Precious moments of kindness and generosity seem all the more precious against that dark backdrop, but even those are few and far between. What starts outside Valentine as a dreamy cowboy fantasy quickly becomes a weary parable about entropy, villainy, and the death of a lie.Dutch’s gang lives at the fringes of society, out in the sort of untamed wilderness that, in 2018, is becoming harder and harder to find. Red Dead Redemption 2 contains the most bracingly beautiful depictions of nature I have ever seen in a video game, and is happy to juxtapose that beauty with the ugly, violent human ambition that will eventually subjugate and destroy it.There is something ironic about a technologically stunning piece of digital entertainment in which the characters constantly lament the relentless progress that will eventually lead to the development of the television and the microchip; the very progress that will allow video games like this one to exist. It reveals something deep and true about our conflicted consumer culture, that some of its finest art righteously castigates the very systems that brought it into being. Red Dead Redemption 2 may be ultimately—or even necessarily—unable to resolve that paradox, but it is more than willing to embrace and attempt to dismantle it.The world of Red Dead Redemption 2 is expansive and engrossing, even while—and often because—the process of interacting with it can be frustrating and inconsistent. Its overwhelming visual beauty invites players in, but its sludgy kinesthetics, jumbled control scheme, and unclear user interface keep them at arm’s length. That artificial distance goes against many commonly understood game design principles, yet also works to help perpetuate the convincing illusion of an unknowable parallel world.I only rarely found Red Dead 2 to be “fun” in the way I find many other video games to be fun. The physical act of playing is rarely pleasurable on its own. It is often tiring and cumbersome, though no less thrilling for it. No in-game activity approaches the tactilely pleasing acts of firing a space-rifle in Destiny, axing a demon in God of War, or jumping on goombas in Super Mario Bros. Red Dead 2 continues Rockstar’s longstanding rejection of the notions that input response should be snappy, that control schemes should be empowering and intuitive, and that animation systems should favor player input over believable on-screen action.Pressing a button in Red Dead 2 rarely results in an immediate or satisfying response. Navigating Arthur through the world is less like controlling a video game character and more like giving directions to an actor. Get in cover, I’ll tell him, only to see him climb on top of the cover. Did I press the button too late? Did my button-press register at all? Dude, get down, I’ll cry, as his enemies begin to open fire. He’ll slowly wheel around, then slide down to the ground with an elaborate stumbling animation. GET IN COVER, I’ll command, pressing the “take cover” button for what feels like the sixth time. He’ll haul his body weight forward, then finally crouch behind the wall.Arthur’s horse adds yet another degree of remove. With a press of a button, Arthur coaxes his horse forward. Pressing it rhythmically in time with the horse’s hoofbeats causes him to urge the horse to a gallop. But you’re still controlling the man, not the horse. Mind your direction, for it is perilously easy to broadside a passing civilian and instigate a firefight, or to collide with a rock or tree, sending man and horse careening catawampus to the ground. Red Dead 2’s horses are meticulously detailed and gorgeously animated, and move through the world like real animals, right up until they don’t. Get too close to a boulder or crosswise to a wagon, and the realistic facade crumbles, leaving you with a grouchy, unresponsive horse with its head clipping through a tree.Almost every interaction must be performed through the same gauzy, lustrous cling-wrap. Firefights are chaotic and random, and aiming often feels wild and unmanageable. Rifles require separate trigger-pulls to fire and to chamber a new round. Enemies move quickly and melt into the world’s overwhelming visual milieux, and my resulting reliance on the heavily magnetized aim-assistance turned most fights into pop-and-fire shooting galleries. Arthur moves slowly, particularly while in settlements or indoors. It’s also possible to make him run too fast, crashing through doors and into civilians. Navigating this world is arduous, heavy, and inelegant. Even the simple act of picking an object up off the floor can require two or three moments of repositioning and waiting for an interaction prompt.In a Rockstar first, every character and animal in Red Dead 2 can be interacted with in a variety of nonviolent ways. Usually that means you look at them, hold the left trigger, then select to “greet” or “antagonize” to govern what Arthur says. After antagonizing, you can antagonize further or “defuse,” and see where things go from there. Characters may ask you a question or request your help, after which highlighting them will give you the chance to choose a response. Like Arthur’s physical interactions, these conversational systems feel awkward and unknowable, yet introduce another fascinating avenue of unpredictability. If I antagonize this guy, will he cower or attack me? If I try to rob this lady, will she acquiesce or, I don’t know, kick me in the nuts?Break the law even mildly while in view of a law-abiding citizen, and they’ll run off to report you. Tarry too long, and a posse will show up and accost you. They may not immediately open fire, instead drawing their weapons and instructing you to keep your hands up. Might they let you go with a warning? Might they arrest you? Or might they shoot first and ask questions later? I’ve had different outcomes in different towns, with different sheriffs, after commiting slightly different crimes. Which was the variable that changed things? I can’t say for sure. By and large that ambiguity enhances the experience, rather than detracting from it.Unlike so many modern open-world games, Red Dead Redemption 2 does not want you to achieve dominance over it. It wants you to simply be in its world, and to feel like a part of it. It’s a crucial distinction, and a big part of what makes it all so immersive and engrossing. The thrill of playing Red Dead 2, like with many other Rockstar games, comes not from how fun or empowering it feels on a moment to moment basis. It comes from the electric sense that you are poking and prodding at an indifferent, freely functioning world.Every interaction in the game, from gunfights to bar brawls to horse races, feels fundamentally unknowable. The slightest mistake or change in course can lead to wildly variable outcomes. That unknowability gives every undertaking an air of mystery that, combined with the incredible level of detail in every square inch of the world, stoked my imagination to begin filling in the gaps. Did this character in town really remember me from the last time I visited, several hours ago? Or was that just the result of a clever bit of scripted dialogue? Is there some hidden system governing who likes me and doesn’t like me, or am I imagining things? Will it really lower my chances of getting arrested if I change my clothes after a bank heist, or is wearing a bandana over my face enough? If I go out in the woods with blood on my clothes, will it attract bears?Those types of questions lurk behind every moment with Red Dead Redemption 2, igniting the game world with the spark of the player’s own imagination. Most modern video games are eager to lay it all out in front of you. They put all the abilities, ranks, levels, and progression systems in a spreadsheet for you to gradually fill out. With Red Dead 2, Rockstar has ignored that trend, opting instead to obfuscate numbers at almost every opportunity. When the game does embrace numerical progression systems, as with the newly expanded leveling system tied to health, stamina, and “dead-eye” slow-mo aim, those systems are often confusingly laid out and poorly explained. Those weaknesses emphasize Red Dead 2’s greatest strength: that it is less an easily understandable collection of game design systems and more an opaque, beguiling world.Here’s a story. It’s dumb, and short, and could stand in for a hundred other similar stories I could tell. After Arthur and the gang came down from the mountains, I found myself finally set loose in the open meadows outside the town of Valentine. I guided my horse away from camp along the road, stopping at the post office outside town. After hitching up and dismounting, I saw a prompt in the corner of the screen indicating that I could “search saddlebag.” Not knowing what that meant, I pressed the button, only to realize with horror that Arthur was reaching not into his own saddlebag, but into the one draped over a stranger’s adjacent horse. I scarcely had time to react before this happened:I almost fell out of my chair with surprise. Arthur hastily backed away from the horse, his left half freshly disheveled and covered in mud. I had only just gotten to town, and I already looked a mess! Thrown for a loop and unsure what to do next, I wandered toward the post office. I watched a passing man pick his nose and eat it.As I walked through the post office, I overheard a woman remark, “I hope that’s only mud on you.” Looking at myself more closely, I wasn’t so sure. I left the building and headed up toward town, still bathed in filth. I went into a bar and instigated a cutscene, throughout which Arthur remained covered in now-slightly-dried mud.I left the bar, only then realizing that Arthur was no longer wearing his hat. A wild west gunslinger needs his hat! Of course, it must have fallen off when the horse kicked me. I rode back to the post office and yep, there it was, lying in the mud.I picked up the hat, put it back on, and rode back to town. Was that experience fun? Not exactly. Was it rewarding or empowering? Quite the opposite. It began with the game violently reacting to an action I hadn’t intended to take. It ended with some backtracking to retrieve a hat that I later would learn I could’ve just magically conjured from my horse. But was it memorable? Was it something that could only have happened in this game? Did it make me laugh, shake my head in amusement, and wonder what small adventure or indignity I might stumble into next? It sure did.At every opportunity, Red Dead Redemption 2 forces you to slow down, take it easy, drink it in. Try to move too fast, and it will almost always punish you. Its pace is outrageously languid compared with any other modern game, especially in its first half. I spent a good chunk of my time just riding from place to place, and once I got where I was going, often went on to engage in extremely low-key activities.Over and over it favors believability and immersion over convenience. Looting an enemy body instigates an involved animation that takes several seconds to complete. Washing your character requires you to climb into a bath and individually scrub your head and each of your limbs. Skinning a dead animal involves a prolonged animation during which Arthur carefully parts the creature’s skin from its muscles before carrying the hide, rolled up like a carpet, over to his horse. You can also choose not to skin the animal and instead cart its entire corpse to the butcher. Don’t leave it tied to the back of your horse for too long, though, or it will begin to rot and attract flies.That consistently imposed slowness forced me to slow down and take in what is arguably this game’s defining characteristic: an incredible, overwhelming focus on detail.Red Dead Redemption 2 lives for details. Were you to create a word-cloud of every review published today, the words “detail” and “details” would almost certainly feature prominently alongside “western” and “gun” and “horse testicles.” It’s impossible not to obsess over the level of detail in this game, from the incredibly detailed social ecosystem of its towns, to the ludicrously elaborate animations, to the shop catalogues and the customizable rifle engravings and on, and on, and on.Let’s start with foliage. I mean, why not? We could start anywhere, so let’s start there. The foliage in this game is fucking transcendent. It is hands-down the most amazing video game foliage I have ever seen. When you walk past it, it moves like foliage should. When you ride through it, Arthur reacts like a person on a horse would probably react to foliage. Even after all these hours, I am still impressed by the foliage.I could talk about the foliage for another four paragraphs, which illustrates how difficult it is to capture the volume and variety of astonishing details in this game. Every weapon and every outfit is accompanied by a fully written, lengthy catalog entry. The fantastic (entirely optional!) theatrical shows you can attend are performed by what appear to be actual motion captured entertainers—the drummer in a proto-jazz band moves his sticks realistically, matching snare and cymbal hits flawlessly to the music, and I am convinced that Rockstar hired a professional fire dancer to come and perform in their mocap studio.Seemingly every minute reveals yet more surprises. Once a man picked my pocket, so I shot him in the leg as he fled. He carried on, limping, until I caught him. Once I randomly struck up a conversation with a disabled Civil War vet who said he remembered me from the last time we talked, which led to an extended, apparently unique conversation concerning Arthur’s life and feelings about what was currently happening in the story. Once I shot at a bandit who was chasing me and accidentally hit his horse, then watched in horrified awe as his horse flipped over onto its face, tripping up the man riding behind him and leaving them in a tumble of limbs and blood.Once, while riding alongside another character in a snowstorm, I realized that if I drew further away from my compatriot, both characters would begin to yell; as I got closer, they returned to their regular speaking voices. After Arthur finished butchering a turkey, I noticed that his right hand remained covered in blood. “I hope that’s not your blood,” a man subsequently said to me as I passed. (Later it rained, and the blood washed off.) Another time, Arthur took off his gun belt before boarding a riverboat casino, and the entire process was fully animated.Those are all examples of something I’ve come to think of as “detail porn.” Video game detail porn is huge on the Internet. People love to share tiny, amazing details from their favorite games, holding them up as praiseworthy evidence of the developers’ hard work and determination. I’ve indulged in my share of detail porn-mongering over the years, mining pageviews and Twitter likes from Spider-Man’s voiceover work, Tomb Raider’s weirdly impressive doorway transition, Horizon Zero Dawn’s amazing animations, Assassin’s Creed Odyssey’s ridiculous helmet physics, and even the absurdly detailed revolver hammers in a Red Dead 2 promotional screenshot. This game will inspire more detail porn than any since Rockstar’s own Grand Theft Auto V. Its incredible focus on minutiae plays an integral role in making it such an overloading and engrossing experience, and often left me marveling at how such a feat of artistic engineering could be completed at all.How did they do this? I asked myself, over and over again. There are answers to that question, of course. Each one raises many more questions of its own.It has long been an open secret in the games industry that Rockstar’s studios embrace a culture of extreme work, culturally enforced “voluntary” overtime, and prolonged periods of crunch. The “secret” part of that open secret evaporated somewhat over the past week, as a controversial comment by Rockstar co-founder and Red Dead Redemption 2 writer Dan Houser set off a cascade of revelations about work conditions at the notoriously secretive company.Over the past month, my colleague Jason Schreier spoke with nearly 90 current and former Rockstar developers, and his report on the matter paints a picture of a vast and varied operation that, for all its talk of change, has clearly spent years embracing and profiting off of a culture of exorbitant overwork that even many who say they are proud to work at Rockstar want to see changed.In the final year of development on Red Dead Redemption 2, the upcoming Western game, the top…Play Red Dead Redemption 2 for just a few minutes, and the fruits of that labor will be immediately apparent. This wonderful, unusual game was clearly a titanic logistical undertaking. Every cutscene, every railroad bridge, every interior, every wandering non-player-character has been polished to a degree previously only seen in more limited, linear games. If Naughty Dog’s relatively constrained Uncharted 4 required sustained, intense crunch to complete, what must it have taken to make a game a hundred times that size, but with the same level of detail? As critic Chris Dahlen once put it while ruminating on how much easily missable, painstakingly sculpted work is included in the average big-budget game, “That’s some fall of the Roman Empire stuff right there.”I sometimes struggled to enjoy Red Dead Redemption 2’s most impressive elements because I knew how challenging—and damaging—some of them must have been to make. Yet just as often, I found myself appreciating those things even more, knowing that so many talented people had poured their lives into crafting something this incredible.Watching Red Dead Redemption 2’s 34-minute credits sequence was a saga all on its own. I’ve watched (and skipped) countless lengthy credits sequences in my years playing video games, but this time I decided to really pay attention, to try to get a real sense of the scope of this eight-year production. First came the names one tends to associate with a game and its overall quality; the executive producers, the studio heads, the directors. Right at the top were the writers, Dan Houser, Michael Unsworth and Rupert Humphries, whose substantial efforts resulted in such a fine script filled with such wonderful characters.Soon thereafter came the technical credits, which began to give a fuller sense of the many, many people who brought this game to life. Here was the “lead vegetation artist,” JD Solilo, joined by 10 other vegetation artists. Becca Stabler’s name was in a bigger font than Rex Mcnish’s, but which of them was responsible for that bush in the GIF I made? Maybe they’d tell me they weren’t responsible at all, and that it was really the engineers who rigged it up.After that came Rod Edge, director of performance capture and cinematography, atop a list of directors and camera artists responsible for making those cutscenes so lifelike and believable. Then came audio director Alastair Macgregor, whose team created a sonic landscape that occasionally inspired me to just close my eyes and lose myself, and who stitched Woody Jackson’s pitch-perfect musical score so seamlessly into the world around me. Who made the rain; who crafted the thunder? Was it George Williamson or Sarah Scott? I don’t know, maybe Matthew Thies was the weather guy.Page after page of names passed by, far too many to read or internalize. Camp & town content design. Animation production coordinators. Horse systems design. (Maybe one of them designed the horse kick that sent me flying into the mud?) Development support. Player insights & analytics. The soundtrack switched to a folk song about the hardships of life. “I’ve been living too fast, I’ve been living too wrong,” crooned the singer. “Cruel, cruel world, I’m gone.”The credits kept rolling, and the fonts got smaller. Some pleasant instrumental music started playing. Soon came the quality assurance testers, the names of whose rank-and-file members were listed in massive blocks spread across four pages.Those people, 383 in all, were responsible for helping make the game as smooth and polished as it is. Many of them were employees at Rockstar’s QA offices in Lincoln, England, reportedly home to some of the most brutal overtime crunch of all. Those testers’ work, like the work of so many game developers, is invisible but no less vital. How many of them caught a gameplay bug that might have destroyed my save file and forced me to start over? Did Reece Gagan, or Jay Patel? Which of them made sure that every plant my character picked from the ground believably flopped over in his hand? Maybe that was Okechi Jones-Williams, or Emily Greaves? And which names weren’t on that list at all? Who were the people who burned out and quit, only to be cut from the credits because, per Rockstar’s stated policy, they didn’t make it across the finish line?It is nearly impossible to answer any of those questions, just as it is impossible to assign credit for this marvelous and unusual game to any one person, or even any team of people. That’s just the way entertainment of this scale is made: vast numbers of people spread around the globe, churning for years in order to make something previously thought to be impossible. It’s a process from a different galaxy than the lone artist, sitting quietly in front of a blank easel. It has as much in common with industry as with art.For years, Rockstar—or at least, Rockstar management—has built and maintained a reputation for being talented, successful jerks. We make great games, their posture has always defiantly communicated, so fuck off. It’s a reputation bolstered by many Rockstar products, most notably the cynical Grand Theft Auto series, with its asshole characters and nihilistic worldview. Yet how to reconcile that reputation with Red Dead Redemption 2? Could a bunch of jerks really lead the effort to create something so filled with humanity and overwhelming beauty?“I suppose our reputation as a company was that we’re profoundly antisocial, histrionic and looking to be controversial,” Dan Houser told the New York Times in a 2012 interview promoting Grand Theft Auto V.  “And we simply never saw it in that light. We saw ourselves as people who were obsessed by quality, obsessed by game design.” Of course, it is possible to be all of those things at once, and given how antisocial and willfully controversial GTA V wound up being, it was hard at the time to take Houser’s comments at face value. Taken alongside this vastly more earnest, heartfelt new game, those comments assume a slightly different cast.Intentional or not, Red Dead Redemption 2 can be read as a meditation on failed leaders, and even as a potent critique of the internal and external cultures that Rockstar has helped perpetuate. Dutch Van der Linde is every inch the manipulative boss, frightening not only for his violent nature but for his ability to marshal people to work against their own self-interest. Time and again he reveals his shameless hypocrisy, and his promises of a new life are consistently shown to be empty maneuvering. “This isn’t a prison camp,” he says at one point, uncannily echoing every supervisor who has ever coerced an underling into a technically optional task. “I am not forcing anybody to stay. So either we’re in this together, working together to get out together, or we’re not. There simply isn’t a reality in which we do nothing and get everything.” I half-expected him to promise everyone bonuses if they hit their sales target.The parallels between game development and gang leadership aren’t always so readily apparent, but Red Dead Redemption 2 repeatedly sets its sights on the systematic damage enabled by irresponsible leaders. It does not celebrate Dutch’s actions or his worldview; it repudiates them in no uncertain terms. Dutch is a failure and a disgrace, arguably the game’s truest villain. Thanks to the first Red Dead, we already know that he fails. We even know how he dies—not in a blaze of noble glory, but alone and cold, with no one left to stand by him. Rockstar Games, one of the most successful entertainment purveyors on the planet, will never meet the same fate, but the people who wrote their latest game sure seem aware of the risks of ambition.Red Dead Redemption 2 is primarily a story about nature. Human nature, but also the natural world, and the catastrophic ways the two intersect. It is an often unbearably wistful homage to a long-lost era, not of human history, but of the Earth itself. It pines for a time when the wind carried only the scents of animals and cookfires, when the world was rich and its bounty seemed limitless, when the night sky was thick with stars and unmarred by light pollution. We do not live in that world, if we ever did. Every year it gets hotter; every year the storms are worse; every year it gets harder to breathe. We are careening toward ruin and no one seems able to stop us. Those with the power to lead appear too blinkered and self-interested to care.I was moved by this video game. I was moved by its characters and their sacrifices, and by the lies I heard them tell themselves. I was moved by its exceptional artistry, and by seeing yet again what is possible when thousands of people drain their precious talent and time into the creation of something spectacular. But above all that, I was moved that so many people would come together to make such a sweeping ode to nature itself; to the wind in the leaves, the mist in the forest, and the quiet hum of the crickets at twilight.Midway through the story, Arthur and Dutch arrive at the city of Saint Denis. “There she is, a real city,” spits Dutch. “The future.” The camera cuts away for our first look at this much-talked-about metropolis. The men have not been greeted with bright lights or theater marquees; they have been met with smokestacks, soot, and the deep groans of industry. An ominous, keening tone dominates the soundtrack. After hours spent freely riding in the open air, it is shocking.Several hours later, I departed Saint Denis and made my return to camp. As Arthur rode, the city outskirts gradually gave way to thickening underbrush. I began to see fewer buildings, and more trees. Before long Arthur and I were once again enfolded by the forest. It was twilight, and the wind was shushing through the trees. A thick fog rolled in, and emerald leaves swirled across the path ahead. I heard rumbles through my headphones; a storm was brewing. Alone in my office, I took a deep breath. I wondered if I would ever taste air as clean as the air Arthur was breathing at that moment.It is human nature to pursue greatness, even when that pursuit brings destruction. It is also human nature to pursue achievement as an end unto itself. Red Dead Redemption 2 is in some ways emblematic of those pursuits, and of their hollowness. The game is saying that progress is a cancer and that humanity poisons all that it touches, but it was forged at the apex of human progress. Its gee-whiz technical virtuosity has a built-in expiration date, and in ten years’ time, the cracks in its facades will be much more apparent. At unimaginable cost and with unsustainable effort, it establishes a new high-water mark that will perpetuate the entertainment industry’s relentless pursuit of more, accelerating a technological arms race that can only end at an inevitable, unfathomable breaking point.But there is a pulse pumping through this techno-artistic marvel. This game has heart; the kind of heart that is difficult to pin down but impossible to deny. It is a wonderful story about terrible people, and a vivacious, tremendously sad tribute to nature itself. There is so much beauty and joy in this expensive, exhausting thing. Somehow that makes it even more perfect—a breathtaking eulogy for a ruined world, created by, about, and for a society that ruined it."

As Red Dead Redemption 2 PC is now available on via Epic Games Store and the Rockstar Launcher, we've republished our original review from October 2018. Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC is essentially the same story and game, with a few additions - photo mode, 8K resolution support, unlocked frame rates and a few other PC additions - you can read how much they change things in our PC playtest here. 




Watch on YouTube    
Herding stray cattle in a storm. Stepping off a train as a drunk man stumbles out of a saloon. Watching the sun set on Mexico as José González’s Far Away marks the halfway point in an epic adventure - moments of quiet reflection dominate my memories of Red Dead Redemption.John Marston’s story was bespattered with brutality, but beauty was always only a dusty verge away in a world where violence and nature collide. Rockstar knows exactly what made the first game special and - as crunchy and satisfying as they were - it wasn’t the gunfights. With the prequel, the GTA developer doubles down on the serene, delivering a shooting game that isn’t afraid of keeping your guns in their holsters. Red Dead Redemption 2 is the most confident, mature game Rockstar has ever made. You can see it immediately in the systems. The language of video games is set. We all know that squeezing the left trigger targets an enemy and the right trigger ends their virtual lives. Here, the left trigger isn’t used solely for murder, however - it’s how you interact with every part of the world. Lock onto a pedestrian and you can give them a tip of the hat and a friendly greeting - all contextual and based on a variety of factors. You can also antagonise them if you’d rather play as a douchebag. This also works for animals, allowing you to study them, whistle, pet them, and scold them. Rather than separating conversations out into dialogue choices and set scenes, this all happens seamlessly in-game. Bullets aren’t your only way of impacting this world, and the fact these conversations aren’t frozen in time - like dialogue options in an RPG - keeps things fluid. It’s a genuine piece of genre-leading innovation. Like I said, we are all fluent in the language of games: big ammo dumps mean there’s a boss fight coming; obvious waist-high cover warns of an impending gun battle; and characters are only capable of certain feats within cutscenes. Red Dead Redemption 2 evolves that language and creates a world where it feels like anything could happen at any time. Even in the final few hours of this generous, grand adventure, I was still seeing one-off animations, unique motion capture playing out on characters in real-time, and new surprises appearing in the world. It would be easy for me to list a bunch of things that happened to me when out exploring this rugged, wild landscape, reeling off the endless anecdotes, but I want to explain how it feels to be a part of this unpredictable ecosystem. You are not the sole agent of change. As Arthur Morgan, you are a member of the Van der Linde gang. As such, you are expected to contribute your share to the camp: offering up a percentage of your cash, ammo, medicine, and hunting goods. But the rest of your gang don’t wait for you to fill up the coffers - they also loot bodies, grab items, and take them back to camp.  
 
Attend a party in camp and there are people telling stories by the fire, gang members playing drinking games, people singing, people dancing, and couples talking among themselves. Just like in real life, you can’t hope to see and hear it all - you simply revel in the ambience and catch snippets in the noise, inserting yourself where you can. The world itself also evolves as you progress. Buildings stay burned down, houses are built, people die, people join your group, and whole towns go into lockdown over your deeds as your camp moves from place to place. Whether you are up in the snow-capped mountains, in the dank swamps of the bayou, or hiding out in the wild forests on edge of a coal mining town, soot-caked to your face from travelling through it on the way to camp, the game makes brilliant use of its space. You are always seeing some new place, and every inch of the map is packed with granular details and stunning horizons. The way the light hits the dusk mist gives the game a painterly, dreamlike, hyper-real quality. This is easily Rockstar’s best virtual place. Artistically, it is miles ahead of anything else. The map isn’t just gorgeous, either - it’s massively varied and teeming with life (over 200 species of animals can be found, each with their own unique behaviour), and you’re still seeing new areas in the final hours of this massive adventure. The way the music blends with exploration and swells for combat also pulls you into the fantasy, and vocal tracks are used sparingly and to stunning effect to highlight big moments in the story.Arthur Morgan’s tale is much more fleshed out than John Marston’s was in Red Dead Redemption. The fact you’re often paired with a companion gives the writing a chance to really dig into the characters as they play off each other. Even 40-50 hours in, one-off conversations with side characters add layers to the protagonist, revealing surprising facts about his past that shed light on his personality and his complex relationship with gang leader Dutch. Arthur's story is underpinned by a bittersweet irony, and it really feels like a tale of redemption this time. When the credits roll, you will appreciate Arthur as a character far more than you ever did of Red Dead protagonist John Marston. Saying that, this prequel does an incredible job of adding depth to the characters you know from the first game as well - you really understand Marston’s plight by seeing him live through his outlaw days, as well as the struggles he puts his wife and son through due to misplaced loyalty. It’s the perfect companion piece, complimenting the story and characters at every turn. Rockstar has previously been criticised for its writing of women, and that feels like something the writing team is addressing here. Each woman in the game has agency, and they all make their own decisions, bad and good. Sadie Adler, a widow who joins the gang early in the game, has one of the best character arcs in the entire story, and she’s up there with some of my favourite video game characters of all time. Red Dead Redemption 2 is a slow burning character study, interspersed with intense gunfights and one-off set-pieces. One minute you might be in a shootout, and the next you might be scooping up cow turds with a pitchfork. It might sound weird, but the moments of quiet give the punchy, tactile, and weighty gunplay something to contrast against. The Euphoria physics are still the best in gaming, seeing enemies clutch wounded areas, topple over railings, or fall into their stirrups to be dragged along by their horse. The weight of Arthur’s movement takes some getting used to and the aiming is a little more methodical than you might expect, but you feel like you’re controlling a person and combat really sings once it clicks because of how reactive the enemy AI is.  
 
There’s also a lot of riding around, which I didn’t mind, but experiences may vary. You can unlock fast travel, but you have to travel quite far a lot of the time just to reach the places where you can fast travel from. Rockstar doesn’t want to pull you out of the experience because it wants the journey to be an integral part of the story. Remember that time you rode off a cliff and you had to mercy kill Gary - your horse - before trekking back to civilisation, only for a pack of wolves to attack you? These unscripted moments stick with you as long as the gut punches of the story. Travelling across the world isn’t meant to be seen as a chore, it’s just more opportunity to see everything the game has to offer. In the entire game, I played two missions where I had to tail someone. I finished every stranger quest, every sidequest, and each main mission, and I was constantly surprised by the variety Rockstar has packed in. I won’t spoil anything here, but some of the missions are among the best, most memorable things I’ve ever played in an open world game. You should discover it all for yourself. Red Dead Redemption 2 is a brave prequel that isn’t afraid of taking risks. It is innovative, surprising, stunning, dramatic, and generous - a highlight of this generation and a benchmark for other open world games to aspire to. Versions tested: PS4 Pro (October 2018), PC (November 2019).Want to find the best horse or find a way to make money fast?

Jason Faulkner 
Since they practically invented the open-world sandbox with Grand Theft Auto 3, Rockstar Games has produced some of the most complex and beloved worlds in video game history. It’s been five years since its last game, Grand Theft Auto 5, debuted, and with the soon to be released Red Dead Redemption 2, we get its first experience tailored wholly around this generation of consoles.The original Red Dead Redemption brought the western genre into video games like never before. The tale of the dying gasps of the wild west as civilization pushed towards the Pacific struck a chord with millions of fans, and the news of a prequel was met with great fanfare. However, the original game left plenty of questions unanswered and stories untold.As I hunted down the scattered remnants of the Van der Linde gang in RDR, I wondered why John rode with them in the past, and what exactly made the gang rise to such notoriety. Red Dead Redemption 2 answers those questions and more. While doing so, it crafts the most in-depth open-world experience since The Witcher 3 and rivals that game in both storytelling and worldbuilding.Red Dead Redemption 2 takes place in 1899, 12 years before the original. It’s around this time that the decline of the wild west lifestyle is beginning. You play as Arthur Morgan, a member of the Van der Linde gang and leader Dutch Van der Linde’s right-hand man.As the game begins, we find the gang running across the snowy mountains of the north after a botched robbery attempt in the town of Blackwater. The initial act of RDR 2 centers around just surviving. Between the cold and a rival gang that has taken up residence in the mountains, the Van der Linde gang’s luck has turned for the worst, and just finding a place the band can call home temporarily is a struggle.It’s in this initial act that one of the game’s overarching themes is introduced: loyalty. Dutch inspires intense loyalty from his followers, and even in the midst of a freezing blizzard, they’re willing to follow his orders despite the risk of life and limb. Arthur may be the most loyal, supporting and believing in Dutch even after the terrible situation his decisions in Blackwater put the gang in.As the story progresses, the question of loyalty becomes a more complicated one. Many members of the gang, including a young John Marston, find themselves questioning their commitment to Dutch as his decisions and attitude moves them from a group of gold-hearted thieves (think Robin Hood and his Merry Men) who just want to live their lives free from the bonds of civilized society to a darker, more selfish band of killers.During the story, you get to see (and shape to an extent) Arthur’s morality develop. In the beginning, he’s little more than a yes-man, there to back Dutch up with a nod or a bullet. As the game continues, there’s an internal struggle within Arthur as to whether he should be loyal to Dutch or loyal to himself. This is where the theme of redemption comes into play. How far is too far, and once you’re there, is there any coming back?Red Dead Redemption 2 takes place in a fictional analog of the American southeast, north, midwest, and west. Although the place names are fictional, I’d say the terrain represented is as far north as Minnesota, east to Missouri, south to Louisiana, and west to California.I don’t want to spoil any surprises the map may hold by going into a ton of detail, but fans of the original will be pleasantly surprised by the inclusion of some familiar places. Red Dead Redemption 2 has much more varied terrain in the sections of the map that are new for this game, though. In addition to the desert and plains of the original game, you can travel to snowy mountains, through the grassy heartland, and into the bayou and swamp.This is a time period where civilization is starting to push west, so there’s an incredible blend of things going on in the world of RDR 2. In the north and northwest, you have forest, mountains, and rivers, with only a house here or there to spoil the wilderness.In the central part of the map is the more settled heartland where you are a lot more likely to run into people. However, the heartland still has a bit of a wild feel, and the main settlements of Valentine and Strawberry look a lot like your stereotypical pioneer or western town.To the south and southeast, you run into the bayou, which is dotted with marshes and swamps. Here you’ll find alligators, catfish, and people who don’t take kindly to strangers. This is contrasted by the sprawling Saint-Denis, a town reminiscent of New Orleans which combines the trappings of a large city with the mystique of the Creole and Cajun peoples.No matter where the story takes you, or where you choose to spend your free time, there’s so much to do and see in RDR 2. Each location features different architecture and different culture. It was awesome to see the contrast between the very stereotypically western Valentine, where the populace is made up of ranchers and farmers, with Saint-Denis, where the NPCs speak French and dress in city fashion.Not only is the map huge, the little touches stated above make it feel like you’re actually going somewhere. It’s not just some big homogenized mass full of fluff and filler. You can tell that the world is handcrafted and that thought was put into even the most remote of locations. Trains and stagecoaches also don’t do the usual video game trick of disappearing and appearing at random. They have their own timetables and stops, passengers board them and disembark, and the whole game is full of little things like this that add to the feeling of immersion.In 1899 the semi-automatic pistol was a new invention, and revolvers were still by and far the most widely used type of sidearm. In Red Dead Redemption 2, gunfighting is a bit more subdued than that seen in Grand Theft Auto, but with what Rockstar has done with the system, it feels more vital and intimate than just firing off a submachine gun.The type of action a gun has plays more into how it controls than almost any game I’ve seen. A Cattleman Revolver (the game’s version of the Colt Single Action Army), for example, will fire when you aim and press R2, but must be cocked with R2 before you can shoot again.This gives an accurate portrayal of the single-action mechanism of the gun. The same gameplay mechanic holds true with repeaters, shotguns, and bolt-action rifles. You have to manually chamber a round before you can fire again. It also adds a new facet to balance for the game’s firearms. For example, you can purchase or find a Double-Action Revolver to use as a sidearm, which has an increased rate of fire over the Cattleman since there’s no need to cock it after each shot. However, the Double-Action is of a smaller caliber than the Cattleman Revolver, so you make a trade-off in damage. For a third option, though, you can fire the Cattleman revolver from the hip. Arthur will fan the hammer, increasing fire rate, but decreasing accuracy.Arthur can carry a sidearm (and an offhand sidearm later on), and two longarms on his shoulder and back. Any weapons you don’t take with you stay with your horse. This means you have to think about what approach you want to bring to each situation before you head into it. If you’re planning a hunt or a stealth mission you’ll want to make sure to grab your bow. For mowing down enemies at a distance, you’ll want a rifle. Having to choose your armament beforehand adds a bit of realism and challenge to RDR 2, and really makes you think of the purpose behind your arsenal.Each gun is customizable as well. If you want a fancy, engraved, matching set of pistols, you can head to your nearest gunsmith. You can modify grips, metal finishes (on multiple parts of the gun), engravings (and their finishes), barrel lengths, and more. You can also add upgrades like improved rifling and scopes to select weapons.For much of the game, I used a customized set of Schofield pistols I modeled after Dante’s Ebony and Ivory from Devil May Cry. Arthur will use whatever sidearm you have equipped in cutscenes as well, so you get to enjoy seeing your customized guns during story bits.Weapons stats are also affected by more than just the construction of the gun. The more familiar your character becomes with a gun by using it, the more performance they’ll get out of it. You can also switch between multiple ammunition types to increase range or damage for a firearm. You can even use ammo with special properties like being incendiary or explosive.You have to care for your firearms as well. Over time or when you get particularly dirty, your guns will start to foul up, and you’ll need to oil them to maintain their condition. Ignore a dirty gun, and you’ll notice penalties to its various stats will crop up.One criticism the original Red Dead Redemption received was that horses felt a bit more like cars with legs than living breathing creatures. It makes sense that if you spent as much time with a horse as the characters in these games do you’d form an attachment to them. In Red Dead Redemption 2 this has been rectified thoroughly, and your relationship with horses is much deeper this time around.Because Red Dead Redemption 2 has limited fast travel, you’re going to be using your horse to get around for the most part. Through the deserts, mountains, plains, and swamps you’ll depend on your horse to get you where you need to go. There are 19 different kinds of horses, and each breed has their own peculiarities and comes in several different colors.You get a horse for free initially, but after that, it’s up to you what kind is right for you. You might want to get a Thoroughbred racehorse for quick speed and acceleration. However, if you’re planning on long rides, a draft horse like the Shire or Belgian Draft Horse, with their immense stamina, might be better for you.The horse bonding system makes it worthwhile to stick with an individual horse and form a connection with them. Keeping them clean by brushing them, making sure they’re fed, and patting them will increase your bond, which will, in turn, allow you to perform more complex maneuvers on the horse, and improve their health and stamina.Bonding with your horse is all about balance as well. If you feed your horse too much, it’ll become overweight and take a stamina penalty. If you don’t feed it enough, it can grow underweight and take a health penalty. You have to take care of your horse as diligently as you do Arthur if you want to get the most out of them.Like with guns, you can select from a wide array of saddles, horse blankets, saddlebags, and bedrolls to outfit your horse with. You can also choose different mane and tail styles and colors, and you can keep up to four horses at the same time.What really brings it all together, though is horse behavior. When you first ride a horse, it might act skittish and need reassuring while you ride it. When you pat it, it’ll stretch its neck and close its eyes in pleasure. I loved watching all the little reactions to stimuli that the horses have, and of course, the most realistic part of all is that they defecate just as a real horse would. The character customization is just as deep as that of the horses and guns. There are a ton of different clothing options to choose from, and you can have Arthur look like a down and out pauper or a turn of the century aristocrat and everything in between.Again, this is a system that would have been cool with just picking from the vast array of clothes and accessories, but what’s going on in the background is what makes it really special. Arthur gets dirty, whether it be mud or blood, and you have to either wash off in a bath in town or plunge into a river to get clean. Arthur’s current hygienic state will be commented on too, so if you don’t want to be known for your stench, you need to keep clean.Temperature comes into play in the game too. As stated above, your travels will take you through snow and desert. When choosing an outfit, you’ll have to note what sort of weather it’s appropriate for. Each area has its own temperature which fluctuates throughout the day, and it will affect your character if they’re not wearing the right outfit. Wear a winter coat in the desert of a light shirt in the snow, and you’ll find that your health core will drain faster. Luckily, you can keep a few changes of clothes on your horse, so it adds a bit of realism without making you go too far out of your way.You’ll also find that Arthur’s hair grows as you play. It can take a few weeks of in-game time, but you’ll go from stubble to full-on ZZ Top as the clock turns. This means if you want a certain hairstyle you’ll need to visit the barber often to maintain it. It’s a far cry from when you could turn a fade to an afro in GTA San Andreas, and it adds quite a bit to the immersion and sense of the passage of time.There’s also a bit of the survival genre in Red Dead Redemption 2. Your three meters, health, stamina, and Dead Eye, all have a core that depletes with time or overuse. As time passes, your stamina core drains which makes your stamina meter recharge slower, to remedy this, you can go to sleep or eat. The same goes for health and Dead Eye. You have to maintain Arthur’s health with food or sleep, or he won’t be at his peak. Like with horses you can also overfeed or underfeed him and receive penalties to specific stats.All three of these stats are leveled up in real-time. The more you run, the stronger your stamina stat will get, and so on. This adds a significant RPG element that was missing from the original RDR and gives you a reward for doing something as simple as running.While the large and immediately apparent aspects of this game are fantastic, it’s the little things that really bring it to life. Whether it’s hunting or fishing against a beautiful backdrop, or getting a haircut because you noticed your character’s hair has gotten a bit too long, all the little background things come together to make a thrilling and immersive world.You know a game is good when you start thinking about its characters and its world more like they were real than just projections on a screen. It’s easy to get caught up in Red Dead Redemption 2 and start thinking of Dutch, Arthur, and others like you really know them, especially after you spend the 50-60 hour main story with them. Even after clearing the story at that mark, there’s still a ton to do and explore in the game, and it’s a bit overwhelming (in a good way).The astounding thing about RDR 2 is that there’s not only a staggering amount of story, side quests, and places to explore but that it’s all high quality and doesn’t feel tacked on. The high level of craftsmanship in this game is evident in all its aspects, and it’s genuinely one of the best games of this generation of gaming.10Jason Faulkner is the Senior Editor of Game Revolution and PlayStation LifeStyle.

Red Dead Redemption 2,Chris Carter,Destructoid,https://www.destructoid.com/review-red-dead-redemption-2-526689.phtml,"darkGetting lost in another world is a perfectly good way for some people to cope with problems in reality.The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind got me through some really tough times: no matter what happened, at the end of the day I could relax and lose myself in Vvardenfell until I dozed off. That was all the way back in 2002.Open world games have considerably evolved since then. Rockstar is proof of that.Red Dead Redemption 2 (PS4 [reviewed on a PS4 Pro], Xbox One)Developer: Rockstar StudiosPublisher: Rockstar GamesReleased: October 26, 2018MSRP: $59.99Red Dead Redemption 2 makes the ballsy and possibly confusing move of pivoting itself as a sequel in name and a prequel in the grand timeline of the Red Dead world. Whisking us away to America’s frontier in 1899, this iteration actually precedes John Marston’s journey by 12 years, allowing for a decidedly different snapshot of the old west.The late 19th century isn’t exactly a period that’s explored all that often as it’s after the more popular Reconstruction and California Gold Rush eras. Under President William McKinley the mythos of the “wild west” is beginning to fade amid growing support for the temperance and progressive movements: in all, a fascinating glimpse into US history. Enter the outlaw Arthur Morgan, our “hero” and proponent of the famous Van der Linde crew, led by the unstable and sometimes well-meaning Dutch.As Dutch’s right-hand man at the height of the gang’s notoriety, you’re kind of a big deal from the get-go. Although we ultimately know what happens to the men in Dutch’s crew by way of Red Dead Redemption, what we get here is a master-crafted character study not unlike the one Vince Gilligan is currently giving us with Better Call Saul in the wake of Breaking Bad. Arthur isn’t quite as interesting as former protagonist Marston out of the gate. He’s less bombastic, more calculating in his thought process. In that way, he’s a better conduit for the player and more of a slow burn.The world around him is similarly grounded. Two of the cardinal sins of modern open world games are bloat and extreme gaminess, both of which frequently take you out of the fantasy. Ubisoft is mostly guilty of the former, filling maps to the brim with pins and forced points of interest to extend playtime. The latter is a transgression that many studios are guilty of in a misguided attempt to balance simulation and arcade fundamentals. Red Dead Redemption 2 never really falls into either of those traps. Now there are 144 cigarette card collectibles and plenty of small things to rummage around for if that’s your thing (as well as stamina and health “core” meters to manage), but bloat isn’t the focus.Comparably there are invisible or otherwise subtle meters that dictate anything from “honor” (how people react to you) to bonuses like more loot, but they’re not obvious. Red Dead Redemption 2 goes for the genuine undertaking of the facilitation of bromances with the camp system (which has flashes of Final Fantasy XV or the droves of relationship-centric JRPGs in recent memory) and backs up those relationships with strong mission design. More often than not you’re going to be saddling up with friends or new acquaintances, fighting, or running alongside them.You will be fighting quite a lot, which is arguably the best bit the game has to offer. Dead Eye (read: super slo-mo vision) returns and although the concept is as old as dust (17 years removed from Rockstar-published Max Payne), it allows for the further beautification of some of the more hectic confrontations (as does the first-person viewpoint). It also knows when to figuratively slow down. There’s a bunch of role-playing (RP) type things that will keep people busy for well over 100 hours. Fishing, poker, cosmetic alterations, that type of stuff. It’s never in-your-face, merely there if you want it.Rockstar threw an insane amount of money at the production of Red Dead Redemption 2 and it shows. There are scores of musical tracks helmed by the talented Woody Jackson, some of which are literally tuned to specific missions. Hell, it has roughly 200 different types of wildlife and each had unique sounds recorded for them. (I’d be remiss to not at least mention the crunch controversy and Rockstar’s response so that you can make up your own decisions, even if it didn’t directly impact this review.)So are all of these stats bullshit? Well in my effort to thoroughly dig through the massive 92GB file size (on PS4), they’re mostly justified. The key thing to remember is that Red Dead Redemption 2 isn’t just comprised of open ranges and fields. Each individual city feels full of life and the go-go nature of the story allows us to head into places like torched villages and snowy mountaintops. Amid all of those grand gestures, the smaller details matter too. There’s impressive penmanship on display within the pages of in-game journals when Rockstar could have gone with the easier route of a traditional typeface. Vendor menus look like a real Sears, Roebuck and Company catalogs.All of that does come at a small cost, like a several-minute load at the start and roughly 15-second restarts after failures/deaths. It sounds like no time at all, but it’s more about the parameters involved: you’ll mostly encounter the former condition as your paper-thin allies are killed, glitch into a bottomless pit, or get snagged by an invisible rock and fall off their horse, instantly failing a mission. Then there’s the typical open world snags like strange animations and odd physics that can cause instant deaths.The gear-swapping radial wheel can be finicky and not work exactly how you want it to. There’s also some silly moments that require suspension of disbelief; like when your crew robs someone wearing the same clothes they always wear, while calling you by your real name, and expecting not to be caught because they have small bandannas over their mouths. Those are all minor complaints and unlike some other open world games, don’t dominate or significantly break Red Dead Redemption 2.As I found myself wandering aimlessly for the umpteenth time, dealing with some of these random annoyances, it hit me why I was so connected to this world: Rockstar isn’t afraid to throw constant conflicts your way because they know the minute-to-minute gameplay can support it. Gunplay is fantastic (Rockstar has pretty much always nailed it), horse fundamentals are slick, random events/skirmishes keep things exciting, and the serene yet complex environments are the backbone for it all. Red Dead Redemption 2 is the epitome of ambition and like most things Rockstar, will meet the expectations associated with it. With all of the advancements since the last Red Dead and everything they’ve learned from Grand Theft Auto V under their belt, the series is in a better place, able to provide a more natural and less gamey world to explore.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher. The online component is coming later this month and is not part of this assessment.]SuperbA hallmark of excellence. There may be flaws, but they are negligible and won't cause massive damage.

Red Dead Redemption 2,Dave Thier,Forbes,https://www.forbes.com/sites/games/2018/10/25/red-dead-redemption-2-review-a-long-hard-lonesome-road/,"Red Dead Redemption 2We'll just start everywhere all at once. Rockstar Games is one of the largest developers in the world, and its games are some of the largest in the industry--you may have heard of the Grand Theft Auto series. These games are not just hits, they are near-universally praised at every turn, monstrous commercial successes and industry-defining juggernauts. It is not hard to see how this has affected development: untainted by failure, its games have gotten bigger and more ambitious at an exponential pace, with the developer spending long years on single games. It takes confidence to do that. Rockstar certainly doesn't seem short on that, company name made manifest.Red Dead Redemption 2 is the followup and prequel to Red Dead Redemption, an open-world epic set against the backdrop of the old American West. It is also the current apex of Rockstar's continuous rise, a game seemingly made without restraints of any kind. I've been playing this game for the past 9 days, and it's clear that this is what happens when you give a massive developer effectively infinite time and effectively infinite resources.This is a good thing, and this is a not good thing. Let's get into it.Red Dead Redemption 2The Story:Full spoilers for the original Red Dead RedemptionRed Dead Redemption 2 opens with our protagonists--Dutch Van Der Linde and his gang of renegades, the player represented by the stoic and square-jawed Arthur Morgan--alone and on the run, deep in snow-covered mountains, starving and freezing. There was a job, the job went bad, and one of the members of your gang dies moments into the campaign. They are looking for a score big enough to buy them the freedom they so badly desire, anywhere but where they are.Things do not get a lot better from there.The game suffers from the prequel problem, a common malady in the expanded universe age but particularly keen here. We know how this all ends, and it does not end well. The gang does not escape to freedom, the big score does not buy our heroes wide open pastures and peaceful lives. We have known how this ends for eight years now: John Marston hunts down and kills the last surviving members of his broken gang, and Dutch Van Der Linde hurls himself off a cliff rather than face his fate. Marston himself is gunned down by federal agents at his home, his wife Abigail dies soon after. Little Jack who loves stories becomes the one thing John died to keep him from being, taking up his father's grim mantle in pursuit of lonely vengeance on an old man fishing by a river.It's rough. But while this does not have to define the game, the writing does nothing to combat it. If anything, Red Dead Redemption 2 picks out those dark threads from Red Dead Redemption and pursues them wholeheartedly by sending us down a long, brutal road with an all-but-certain ending. It's easy to tell the kernel that led to the game here: what if we made a Western, the writers seemed to say, but instead of going West, they go East? Our heroes are fleeing away from the plains and towards the Atlantic, the world closing in on them as they do. It's a notion, and it gives us a chance to look at some parts of the country we don't usually see in something we'd call a Western, sacrificing that dramatic landscape that defines the Western aesthetic in the process. Still, our main characters are clearly not happy about it, and everything around them reflects that: we leave the wide-open plains for the hazy blood feuds of the old south and a miserable 19th-century mining town where the workers live in dark hillside cabins. Our protagonist looks at the smokestacks of the game's industrial city with palpable dread, and at that point, you're barely halfway through the story.That funereal tone permeates much of the game, but this is not to say there isn't wonder to be had while pursuing the game's main story. There is most certainly wonder to be had. You will have shootouts with cops on a New Orleans Saint Denis streetcar. You'll rob banks and trains, you'll gallop away loot in hand, blasting a shotgun off the back of your horse. There's a riverboat heist and bounties to collect, there's a damn hot air balloon. There is nothing quite like the feeling in one mission when the gang rides in force, thundering down an Oak Alley at a Southern Plantation home, horns blaring and guns cracking, righteous fury burning as you take those aristocrats apart and burn the place to the ground. You'll fire cannons at warships and milk cows, you'll take out a gang of sleazy Pinkertons in three-piece suits with a couple of perfectly-placed deadeye shots and feel like a superhero every time.And the score--my God, the score. The score is soaring, grand and sometimes tender, touching off moments both large and small with thundering percussion, soaring horns, nasty guitar and everything else you want out of a Western soundtrack, even a Southern soundtrack. There is Jazz on the streets even though this is meant to be 1899, though we can forgive that. There are moments with full, vocal songs, just like in the original Red Dead Redemption, and they manage to do their work as carefully and powerfully as they did in the first game. If there is anything here in this game that feels actually, genuinely perfect, it's the music.And that's what's hard about the story here. It hits so many moments so well and so hard that it will get your heart racing and your eyes watering: it will never fail to pull you in, that's for certain. It's expertly crafted with naturalistic writing, acting and motion capture that make the characters feel like real people, an uncommon feat in a video game. It's just that it's all stitched together with a long, thankless death march towards oblivion, and that has a way of wearing on you. We rack up a price on our heads wherever we go, we move on from there, we do it again.And yes, it is long. It is too long. Playtime will vary, but you should be allotting dozens of hours at the very least, a large portion of which will be taken up by cutscenes and long horse rides with and without dialogue. In an interview with Vulture, Rockstar's Dan Houser talked about how the team cut about five hours from the games shortly before launch. That's not shocking: cuts happen. What's shocking to me that anything at all was cut from this game, at least based on everything that was left in. One mission had you get a boat from a local fisherman but required you to empty a bunch of crawfish traps in the process. Another was mostly just a shopping trip with some conversation on the way. Another just involved getting drunk in a bar and winding up vomiting in a field far from your horse, and I'm still not sure what the point of that one was.This was a story that needed many things, but most of all it needed editing or even just reorganization. It's no problem for an open world to have this much content in it, but to foist it all on the main story removes the concept of choice that's so essential to the genre. I'd love to empty crawfish traps, but I want the decision to do so to be mine. The length isn't just about how much time you have on hand, it's about how much you can bear: a grim Western movie might be 2 hours long, and there are plenty from which Red Dead Redemption 2 takes its inspiration. This can be 20 times that.If you stick with the story through its extended runtime, you won't be disappointed. You will see everything carried to its conclusion, and you will encounter moments so well-crafted that they will almost make you forget about everything that came before. But most people likely won't do that, if history and data serve as guides. An extended epilogue brightens things up considerably, and I'd encourage anyone who makes it halfway through this game to power through until that point. It's still relative, and it still can't outrun the prequel problem.Red Dead Redemption 2The world:And now, the good stuff. The good stuff, mind you, is very, very good. Here with Red Dead Redemption 2, Rockstar Games has built the most detailed, expansive, and flat-out beautiful game world I've ever seen. I might have written that eight years ago minus the ""2"", but I am writing that with every piece of sincerity that I had back then. Near every screenshot of this game feels like a triumph from a purely visual point of view, and that's worth the price of admission alone.The wide-open vistas of the western portions are the obvious stars of the show, but equally impressive are the hazy evenings in the deep south, the cypress swamps and long wooden causeways. Saint-Denis is the game's stand-in for New Orleans, and it's a feat that I didn't expect to see here. This is where we see Rockstar's infinite resources on full display, and there's something glorious about it. Every saloon, bar and restaurant is rendered in exquisite, exhausting detail to the point where you stop looking at it because you just trust that it's there. It's a little like the way I don't keep my eye on a river in the real world to see if the fluid mechanics hold up: I just trust that they do.That's the built world, but it extends to how we interact with it too. The shooting, the walking, the riding, the taking cover: it all feels weighty, intentional and physical. There's a trick to shooting where pulling the trigger once fires your gun and pulling it a second time cocks it, offering both a different style of combat than what we're used to and that always-pleasing mechanical feeling you get when you watch a gunslinger cock a rifle in an old movie. You can also fire from the hip with both hands, slamming on the trigger like a bandit shooting up a saloon, and it feels marvelous every time you get a chance to pull that one off. You keep your guns on your horse, and you can only carry two sidearms and one longarm at the time: it can get annoying, but it leads to this moment when you get off your horse and choose what guns you want for the mission as your character pulls them out of the saddlebags. The annoyance here is almost the point: the guns feel less like icons in a menu and more like real objects that exist in this world, and they don't just magically travel with you. When you buy them in a store your character flips through a catalog and selects what he wants.It's all more interactive than I've ever seen in an open world game before. Take, for example, the concept of ""cores."" You have a health core, a stamina core and a deadeye core, all of which affect how quickly their respective meters fill up. You can refill the meters with tonics, but the cores drain more slowly and you refill them with food and drink. On its own, its sort of a quixotic and complex system. But what it does is encourage you to interact with the world in a more subtle way than the usual straightforward hunger meter: lots of games let you drink at bars, but this one actually gives you a good reason to do it. And so when you roll into town you walk into a saloon for a plate of food and a shot of whiskey with a real sense of purpose, likely followed by a bath and a shave to get yourself in order. Or maybe shoot a rabbit and cook it at camp on a long ride. Maybe you yank the cork out of a bottle of brandy with your teeth and pound it behind a rock before popping out and blasting a bunch of company men with your pistol on your hip. It feels good, all of it. The hunting could be its own game, tracking packs of deer and rabbits across the open plains and following legendary predators down grisly trails. It has that same physicality that makes the eating and drinking so satisfying: when you kill a deer and bring it back to camp, it drapes over the back of your horse and its head waggles as you ride. If you skin it, you watch your character peel the hide off and drape it over the back of your horse. It's not just an icon in your inventory, it's right there, travelling with you.The same thing applies to the social side of the game, something I didn't know open world games needed until now. If you holster your gun in town, you'll find that holding the aim button now locks on to people and lets you talk to them, whether it's a simple greeting or trying to goad them into a fight. It's a small thing but a big one, giving a sense of life and character to situations in other games that just let you either murder someone or keep on walking. True, most of what you can do still involves conflict, to some degree. It still works.Rockstar more or less invented the modern open world game with GTA 3, and we see here that the developer never really stopped improving on concepts that most others let sit years ago. The world is prettier and more detailed than any I've seen before, sure: that's as much a product of time, money and technology than anything else. But it's more than that. It's a world with a sense of grounded, interactive presence that I've never quite seen in a game before. It's a world I feel like I can live in.Red Dead Redemption 2The problem:Rockstar's open world ambitions have been at odds with its cinematic ambitions for a decade at least. We saw this with GTA 4, where Niko Bellic's ostensibly noble-ish intentions occasionally came into conflict with his habit of driving sportscars down crowded Algonquin sidewalks. We saw this in GTA 5, where a notion of characters that did jobs but never really got paid crippled a sense of progress and exploration in a world that seemed to call for it. The two found a kind of perfect truce in Red Dead Redemption with a story about a quest for freedom through violence on the open plains.The two are essentially on different planets here.On the one hand, we have the story. Grim, relentless and inescapable, it forces the gang out of every location they become comfortable in and puts them in an increasingly desperate situation over the course of more hours than most people will even put into the game.On the other we have the world: rich, deep and expansive, begging to be explored, and much bigger than the story even indicates. And yet the story seems to actively discourage experiencing it at every turn. Do we really want to pay for upgrades at this camp where all anyone will talk about is how it wasn't like it used to be? Do I want to go out and get a new hat for this morose, near-suicidal gunslinger? Do I want to pay off my bounties so I can travel in peace, knowing that I'm just going to get more bounties minutes later? Is this guy really going to just sit down and watch a show, given all the nonsense going on? The story is, more than anything, a story that drives you to see it finished. Perhaps a good thing for a traditional cinematic experience or even a linear game, bad for an open world game and worse for one quite this long.It feels like the writers here wanted to create a feeling of being penned in and desperate with no good options save what's in front of you. They largely succeeded in that, so: good news. It's just that this particular story is almost uniquely ill-suited to open world gameplay. I have a *feeling* that this will be rectified by Red Dead Online, where I will hopefully feel the sunshine on my shoulders as I spend an afternoon hunting deer on the great plains. But that game isn't out yet, and all I have is what's in front of me.Red Dead Redemption 2The bottom line:It's a rough one, this one. Red Dead Redemption 2 is big, unwieldy and ill-equipped to be boiled down to a number. Both its triumphs and its failures live at grand extremes: maddening, beautiful and awesome. The game hits each every one of its moments with grace and force, whether they're bombastic gunfights or a small moment on a boat in a lake outside Blackwater. I'm leaving my playtime overwhelmed, emotional and drained in a way that I haven't quite felt since the original Red Dead Redemption.And yet I just can't quite forget those dozens of hours I spent slogging through a ceaselessly grim, hopeless storyline, well-crafted though it may have been. I can't forgive the time I spent galloping from checkpoint to checkpoint, just wishing for a little light that never seemed to come. I can't forget it especially knowing that many players will never make it through to see what's on the other side, because this sort of length just feels self-indulgent. I think about people I know: some of whom I would recommend play Red Dead Redemption 2 wholeheartedly, without reservation. Others I would just tell to stay away. Those same players I might tell to check out Red Dead Online, but that's not the game I'm reviewing here.If you have the time and the inclination, buy Red Dead Redemption 2. It's a great game. It's an impressive game. Just know what you're getting into, and do your best to make it through the story to what's on the other side.

Login NowIn Red Dead Redemption 2, Rockstar Games has created a living world that expertly balances a fast-paced narrative with peaceful moments of reflection.There was a point in Red Dead Redemption 2 where the high-paced narrative became a bit overwhelming. Playing as Arthur Morgan, lead enforcer for the Van der Linde gang, I needed a break from the daily grind of murder, robbery, and being chased by relentless bounty hunters and law enforcement officials who wanted our gang of outlaws exterminated.Early one morning, needing a quiet adventure with no stress, I hopped on my horse and headed north in search of some boars I wanted to hunt for their hides. After arriving at night, I set up camp, cooked and ate by the fire, then went to sleep. I awoke early, did a little fishing, had breakfast and coffee, and then went boar hunting. The hunt was successful, and after another night of sleeping under the stars I felt recharged and began making my way back to the gang to resume the high-paced adventure that is Red Dead Redemption 2’s narrative.That, in a nutshell, is how the Red Dead Redemption 2 experience feels: a well-balanced mix of intense storytelling and the freedom to seek out quiet moments with nature, all set near the end of the Wild West era in 1899 America. Hitting PS4 and Xbox consoles on October 26, 2018, Red Dead Redemption 2 is perhaps Rockstar Games’ greatest accomplishment to date in both scale and quality. It borrows many of the mechanics players have seen in other Rockstar titles, but generally enhances them while building a world that feels alive. However, Red Dead Redemption 2 is not without its issues.Red Dead Redemption 2 has a very long story to tell. Missions are a mix of fun side adventures, epic robberies and heists, and crucial moments where it feels like everything might fall apart if Arthur doesn’t keep moving at break-neck speed. Amazingly, nothing ever feels disconnected from the core of who Arthur Morgan is or the goals and responsibilities he has to the Van der Linde gang. There was never a point where I felt what I was asked to do was irrelevant, or that something was added in as filler to make the experience longer. The story progression and side activities are connected. Activities like hunting and fishing not only offer peace and quiet, they also provide food for Arthur and the gang, or materials needed to craft custom clothing or upgrades to the camp.Speaking of activities, there are a lot, and each feels intuitive. Robbing trains, shops, or random people isn’t just something initiated by the story or when a waypoint pops up; all of them can be done on a whim. When riding near a train or stagecoach, approach it, hop on, then rob it, just because it was there and that’s what outlaws do. When walking into a saloon, have a meal, play some poker, and maybe get into a fight because that nonsense happens in saloons. Take a trip to town because supplies are needed at the general store, or shoot a deer that dares get too close because the butcher is on the way back to camp and Arthur could use the five bucks.On the topic of hunting and fishing, both have a surprising amount of depth to them. Players can use Eagle Eye while hunting, allowing them to track animals by scent or blood trail. It also pays to study prey from a distance, getting a feel for what type of weapon and ammunition should be used to take it down and not ruin the condition of the hide. Shoot a small bird with a Repeater and it’s probably going to be badly damaged. Shoot a bear with a Varmint Rifle and it’s likely to maul you. You can also use bait to draw animals in, or apply substances to cover your scent and allow you to get close. When you do kill a large animal, Arthur can toss it on the back of his horse and ride home with the carcass intact. Just don’t leave it there too long, otherwise it will start to rot while still on the back of your horse.Fishing is also quite engaging, although it took a long time to be introduced. Players must retrieve their pole from their inventory, choose the right bait for the type of fish at that location, and even consider the weather conditions for the type of fish they’re after. When trying to fish without bait Arthur will call himself an idiot, and care must be taken to properly hook the fish, tire it out, and then reel it in. It’s not a hard system to master, but it’s just challenging enough to be rewarding without becoming boring.All missions and activities in Red Dead Redemption 2 are tied together by the shooting, moving, wanted level, and bounty mechanics, and that’s where some of the game’s most annoying issues pop up. Movement didn’t bother me much in the first 20 or so hours I played, but it felt wonkier the further I progressed. At times I wanted to gallop by a random event, but the game forced me to slow to a trot, apparently afraid I would miss it. There were instances where I would need to follow a character and remain quiet, but transitioning from running to cover in an instant led to disaster. There were more horse collisions with NPCs than I can count, and most ended up with me being wanted for unarmed assault or murder, possibly with a bounty on my head depending on how violent the crash was.The wanted and bounty systems are good in theory, and partly in execution, but it all falls apart for me once there is a big price on my head. Committing a crime runs the risk of having a witness report Arthur to the law. It’s possible to chase and silence the witness through intimidation, and it’s satisfying when it works, but if reported Arthur will become wanted. That works like the wanted level in Grand Theft Auto V, with players having to evade the law in a designated search area. Sometimes, though, a bounty will be placed on Arthur’s head. When that bounty exceeds $100 it’s nearly impossible to move through populated areas, even if the intent is to pay off the bounty. Dozens of bounty hunters and law enforcement officials will attack, and even if successful in shooting it out, the price on Arthur’s head will probably only get larger. Huge amounts of the game world are basically off limits at that point, and the only way I’ve been able to solve this problem is by riding to far away towns where I’m not wanted to pay off my bounty in another state. Having a bounty on my head should feel tense and meaningful, but often it’s just annoying, a feeling which is amplified when the cause is a collision of horses that should just be a hilarious random encounter.The shooting mechanics, however, are fantastic. They too are very much built in the style of Grand Theft Auto V, but with the addition of Dead Eye, a time-slowing ability that Arthur can use to get himself and his fellow gang members out of a jam. The shooting feels tight even when Dead Eye isn’t in use. It’s largely based on peeking out from cover, and there is an auto-aim function that will lock onto the target, allowing the player to shoot for center mass, or make a minor adjustment for the headshot. It works on horseback, too. Being chased (or chasing someone) across the land is satisfying because it’s relatively easy to ride and shoot, or ride and use the lasso. You can even shoot fish, pick them up, and take them back to camp, or lasso a boar and kill it with your knife to preserve the quality of the hide. If it feels like you should be able to do it, you probably can.Part of what pushes the Red Dead Redemption 2 experience from good to great is the audio and visual quality across the board. No, it doesn’t look as good on console as it will on PC, but it still looks fantastic, save for a subtle motion blur that makes identifying animals while on horseback a bit rough. It’s the landscape that does it. Moving from snowy mountains to humid wetlands, or from arid deserts to tropical islands, all feels seamless. On a particularly long horseback journey, I rode from one distinct biome to another without ever realizing it was happening.It’s on those long journeys that the audiovisual excellence of Red Dead Redemption 2 combines by way of the cinematic camera. When on a long trip, players can activate this view and sit back while Arthur rides to his destination. Following a crucial point in the story, I used the cinematic camera and it felt like a scene from a movie as I rode home, complete with a song that convinced me I must own the soundtrack. It was another moment where Rockstar nailed the delicate balance between life, death, and opportunity for reflection.In addition to a great soundtrack, Red Dead Redemption 2 features quality voice acting. Each character, whether main or minor, is distinct and believable. Most dialogue will run through Arthur Morgan, and players are in for a treat there. Although Arthur and I don’t have a lot in common, I could identify with how tired and overwhelmed he was, and that kept me engaged even when the story was taking its toll on me.There was little doubt in my mind that Red Dead Redemption 2 would be fun, but what surprised me the most was how much I wanted to be in the world. Although quite long, the story kept me engaged, but the entire time I was pushing the Van der Linde gang’s interests forward, I was dying to head out fishing or hunting, just to be in the environments and explore without a destination. Soon, however, I would be itching to get back to the story.There are issues with Red Dead Redemption 2, such as minor movement annoyances and the bounty system, but none of those overshadow the brilliance of how well each part of the game fits with the others to bring the world alive and make it feel rewarding.Open-world games are becoming bigger every year. It’s not uncommon for them to have over 100 hours of content. Most are unable to make all that content feel important and engaging, though. This is not a problem in Red Dead Redemption 2. It wouldn’t surprise me if I ended up spending 200 hours on a single save, then loading it back up in a few months to do it all again. Whether I’m chasing the thrill of a daring train robbery, or the serenity of a solo camping trip, Red Dead Redemption 2 is an open-world game I will return to time and time again.Bill, who is also known as Rumpo, is a lifelong gamer and Toronto Maple Leafs fan.

					Bill Lavoy posted a new article, Red Dead Redemption 2 review: Cowboy up 
					Did you play it in a regular or pro ps4? How was the frame rate? Consistent? Slow downs? 				
					96 metacritic. EG has Tech articles and videos up. Short short version: XB1: Lowest IQ, decent performance with fairly common dips to below 30PS4: Better IQ, decent/good performance with less dips to below 30PS4Pro: Even better IQ, few drops to below 30XB1X: Best IQ and almost no drops at all to below 30. So what you'd expect, pretty much. They also specifically mentioned that asset streaming is done brilliantly, meaning no hitching when moving in the world.				
					Correction: Performance between vanilla PS4 and XB1 is apparently the other way around, misread. So XB1, while having lower IQ, apparently doesn't drop quite as low as the base PS4 in some cases. Probably due to higher CPU freq.				
					It's going to be like a 103 Metascore for the PC version next year. Can't wait!				
					Yeah, I hope we're getting a PC version. This is one of those rare occasions where double dipping doesn't really bother me.				
					I'll hold out for PC. Shooters suck with the gamepad. :(				
					I thought you bought a ps4 for this?? not all shooters suck with a gamepad. you're going to end up waiting as long as you have for rdr1. and even if you don't wtf you could play it now. don't be stupid, crustar !!!!				
					I bought a ps4 for Spider-Man, GoW, and other cool exclusives. :\				
					there's still 9 minutes left to correct your mistake				
					So if I'm deciding between PS4 Pro or XB1X it sounds like Xbox is the way to go.				
					Welp, move over HZD, I'll get back to you 				
					No you won't and that's ok because it isn't very good.				
					Eyeroll.gif 				
					Lol so edgy				
					HEY GUYS two wrongs don't make a right!				
					Harsh bro. That's a bold statement, considering that I actually finished HZD and have never finished a Rockstar game since GTA3 (and Vice City.. maybe).				
					Great review, Bill.				
					Good work having him review the game, briefcase duder.				
					LOL, thanks.				
					Good read !				
					Good stuff				"

As Red Dead Redemption 2 PC is now available on via Epic Games Store and the Rockstar Launcher, we've republished our original review from October 2018. Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC is essentially the same story and game, with a few additions - photo mode, 8K resolution support, unlocked frame rates and a few other PC additions - you can read how much they change things in our PC playtest here. 




Watch on YouTube    
Herding stray cattle in a storm. Stepping off a train as a drunk man stumbles out of a saloon. Watching the sun set on Mexico as José González’s Far Away marks the halfway point in an epic adventure - moments of quiet reflection dominate my memories of Red Dead Redemption.John Marston’s story was bespattered with brutality, but beauty was always only a dusty verge away in a world where violence and nature collide. Rockstar knows exactly what made the first game special and - as crunchy and satisfying as they were - it wasn’t the gunfights. With the prequel, the GTA developer doubles down on the serene, delivering a shooting game that isn’t afraid of keeping your guns in their holsters. Red Dead Redemption 2 is the most confident, mature game Rockstar has ever made. You can see it immediately in the systems. The language of video games is set. We all know that squeezing the left trigger targets an enemy and the right trigger ends their virtual lives. Here, the left trigger isn’t used solely for murder, however - it’s how you interact with every part of the world. Lock onto a pedestrian and you can give them a tip of the hat and a friendly greeting - all contextual and based on a variety of factors. You can also antagonise them if you’d rather play as a douchebag. This also works for animals, allowing you to study them, whistle, pet them, and scold them. Rather than separating conversations out into dialogue choices and set scenes, this all happens seamlessly in-game. Bullets aren’t your only way of impacting this world, and the fact these conversations aren’t frozen in time - like dialogue options in an RPG - keeps things fluid. It’s a genuine piece of genre-leading innovation. Like I said, we are all fluent in the language of games: big ammo dumps mean there’s a boss fight coming; obvious waist-high cover warns of an impending gun battle; and characters are only capable of certain feats within cutscenes. Red Dead Redemption 2 evolves that language and creates a world where it feels like anything could happen at any time. Even in the final few hours of this generous, grand adventure, I was still seeing one-off animations, unique motion capture playing out on characters in real-time, and new surprises appearing in the world. It would be easy for me to list a bunch of things that happened to me when out exploring this rugged, wild landscape, reeling off the endless anecdotes, but I want to explain how it feels to be a part of this unpredictable ecosystem. You are not the sole agent of change. As Arthur Morgan, you are a member of the Van der Linde gang. As such, you are expected to contribute your share to the camp: offering up a percentage of your cash, ammo, medicine, and hunting goods. But the rest of your gang don’t wait for you to fill up the coffers - they also loot bodies, grab items, and take them back to camp.  
 
Attend a party in camp and there are people telling stories by the fire, gang members playing drinking games, people singing, people dancing, and couples talking among themselves. Just like in real life, you can’t hope to see and hear it all - you simply revel in the ambience and catch snippets in the noise, inserting yourself where you can. The world itself also evolves as you progress. Buildings stay burned down, houses are built, people die, people join your group, and whole towns go into lockdown over your deeds as your camp moves from place to place. Whether you are up in the snow-capped mountains, in the dank swamps of the bayou, or hiding out in the wild forests on edge of a coal mining town, soot-caked to your face from travelling through it on the way to camp, the game makes brilliant use of its space. You are always seeing some new place, and every inch of the map is packed with granular details and stunning horizons. The way the light hits the dusk mist gives the game a painterly, dreamlike, hyper-real quality. This is easily Rockstar’s best virtual place. Artistically, it is miles ahead of anything else. The map isn’t just gorgeous, either - it’s massively varied and teeming with life (over 200 species of animals can be found, each with their own unique behaviour), and you’re still seeing new areas in the final hours of this massive adventure. The way the music blends with exploration and swells for combat also pulls you into the fantasy, and vocal tracks are used sparingly and to stunning effect to highlight big moments in the story.Arthur Morgan’s tale is much more fleshed out than John Marston’s was in Red Dead Redemption. The fact you’re often paired with a companion gives the writing a chance to really dig into the characters as they play off each other. Even 40-50 hours in, one-off conversations with side characters add layers to the protagonist, revealing surprising facts about his past that shed light on his personality and his complex relationship with gang leader Dutch. Arthur's story is underpinned by a bittersweet irony, and it really feels like a tale of redemption this time. When the credits roll, you will appreciate Arthur as a character far more than you ever did of Red Dead protagonist John Marston. Saying that, this prequel does an incredible job of adding depth to the characters you know from the first game as well - you really understand Marston’s plight by seeing him live through his outlaw days, as well as the struggles he puts his wife and son through due to misplaced loyalty. It’s the perfect companion piece, complimenting the story and characters at every turn. Rockstar has previously been criticised for its writing of women, and that feels like something the writing team is addressing here. Each woman in the game has agency, and they all make their own decisions, bad and good. Sadie Adler, a widow who joins the gang early in the game, has one of the best character arcs in the entire story, and she’s up there with some of my favourite video game characters of all time. Red Dead Redemption 2 is a slow burning character study, interspersed with intense gunfights and one-off set-pieces. One minute you might be in a shootout, and the next you might be scooping up cow turds with a pitchfork. It might sound weird, but the moments of quiet give the punchy, tactile, and weighty gunplay something to contrast against. The Euphoria physics are still the best in gaming, seeing enemies clutch wounded areas, topple over railings, or fall into their stirrups to be dragged along by their horse. The weight of Arthur’s movement takes some getting used to and the aiming is a little more methodical than you might expect, but you feel like you’re controlling a person and combat really sings once it clicks because of how reactive the enemy AI is.  
 
There’s also a lot of riding around, which I didn’t mind, but experiences may vary. You can unlock fast travel, but you have to travel quite far a lot of the time just to reach the places where you can fast travel from. Rockstar doesn’t want to pull you out of the experience because it wants the journey to be an integral part of the story. Remember that time you rode off a cliff and you had to mercy kill Gary - your horse - before trekking back to civilisation, only for a pack of wolves to attack you? These unscripted moments stick with you as long as the gut punches of the story. Travelling across the world isn’t meant to be seen as a chore, it’s just more opportunity to see everything the game has to offer. In the entire game, I played two missions where I had to tail someone. I finished every stranger quest, every sidequest, and each main mission, and I was constantly surprised by the variety Rockstar has packed in. I won’t spoil anything here, but some of the missions are among the best, most memorable things I’ve ever played in an open world game. You should discover it all for yourself. Red Dead Redemption 2 is a brave prequel that isn’t afraid of taking risks. It is innovative, surprising, stunning, dramatic, and generous - a highlight of this generation and a benchmark for other open world games to aspire to. Versions tested: PS4 Pro (October 2018), PC (November 2019).Want to find the best horse or find a way to make money fast?

Red Dead Redemption II is not a tale about people who often do good things, as protagonist Arthur Morgan sums it up early in the game. This game’s central band of outlaws is sympathetic at times but never blameless.Ostensibly, this dirty lens on life is used to tell an earnest story about outlaws struggling to survive on the edge of modernity. Indeed, many of the vignettes found in this fictionalized version of the American West are beautiful, and many of the real-world experiences of vagabonds and frontier folk are distilled into some exceptional arcs. But these plains are vast, and not everything on offer presents a clear vision.As Arthur Morgan, you take on the role of the gang's enforcer, and you get to manage Arthur’s life like an elaborate Wild West Tamagotchi. You'll have to keep track of his food and water intake, keep him comfortable in all kinds of locales and temperatures, and even manage his mane and beard. On top of that, you can hunt for food, track down outlaws, run heists, and bond with your horse (which means training, feeding, and caring for it in turn). I could go on.Perhaps the biggest draw to RDR II for most will be the patently absurd amount of Content™.  The list of possible activities in RDR II quickly grows staggering, and world-enriching details abound. In every shop, there's a catalog you can rifle through for everything from pistols to salted pork, each page filled with descriptions and prices in a palpable context. Then there are the graphical touches: the tightening skin of a horse as its muscles swell to prep for full gallop; the crisp blades of prairie grasses between which flit all manner of varmints. It’s nothing short of stunning.All of this attention to detail and mundanity works as a way to pull you into the world of 1899 in a very real sense. The traditional open-world exploration interface has been cut down to a handful of symbols that track your core health and well-being, as well as an optional minimap that can collapse into a simple on-screen compass (or even to nothing at all). All of this helps sell this place as one where you can earnestly live, for a time, as a part of this tight-knit criminal enterprise.Exhaustive though it may be, this interlocking network of minute systems also works together to pace out play quite nicely. That’s especially true if you're the type who is just as content wandering through towns taking in the sights as min-maxing your stats. The added commitment to a minimalist interface, which communicates so much through the world itself, really enhances the feeling of fully inhabiting a gamified simulation.That intense world-building alone would be enough to make RDR II an extremely satisfying experience. But, for better and worse, this game also attempts to craft a complicated narrative that has just as many moving parts as the simulated world in which it sits. Rockstar has had mixed success with this kind of storytelling before, but this is certainly the studio’s best effort to date. Still, the game's attempts at realism can at times obfuscate some narrative choices and arbitrarily deny others.
Rockstar's second trailer was chock full of gameplay (more traditional trailer if curious)RDR II begins with a desperate trek through a late-spring blizzard. Soaked in two feet of barely frozen snow, this alpine storm is the sort that devours the spirit and wastes the body. But our pitiful troupe presses on, convinced that the only way forward is following a lethally bungled heist that has set brutish lawmen and sadistic rivals on their tail.The desperation of the game's first act quickly lets up as the band pulls through the mountains and sets camp. There, group leader Dutch van der Linde—the brains and heart of the operation—gives a rousing speech, telling everyone to earn their keep by gathering supplies, food, munitions, and, of course, money.This is where the game really opens up, allowing you to step away from Dutch’s close guidance to make your own living. Hunting, trading, and even bounty hunting are all viable careers, for a time, and all provide exceptional opportunities to marvel at the glittering rural American sky or the sweeping Rocky Mountain stand-ins. Gambling, robbing, and seedier means of acquisition are also available for less scrupulous and/or more outdoorsy types, and you can shuffle through the options depending on your shifting preferences.After a while, it’s easy to settle into a new rhythm of your digital outlaw life, a cycle of in-game work that provides the means to get supplies for you and your camp. Hunt a whitetail, for instance, and you can sell its pelt and flesh for munitions and a coffeemaker back at the base. That coffeemaker in turn keeps you moving a bit better through the rugged terrain, aiding you in the next trip through the cycle.RDR II's work cycle creates a forgiving system where, no matter what vocation you pick, you can figure out a way to bring in some cash. But it’s also an extremely simplified version of the hardships people actually faced in the American wilderness. Even with the simulated elements to contend with, Arthur seems to have inhuman stamina, and a constitution that strains believability, even as it provides a firm foundation for the playspace.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

Red Dead Redemption 2,Adam Cook,God is a Geek,https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/red-dead-redemption-2-pc-review/,"November 5, 2019.What is there to say about Red Dead Redemption 2 that hasn’t already been said? It’s a tough one, but with the release of Rockstar’s phenomenal game on PC (and now Stadia, too), a flood of emotions come running through me. This is a game that, like 2018’s God of War, I don’t think we’re truly able to yet understand the full impact of upon the wider industry.It’s telling that those two games vied for the top spot in our Game of the Year awards last year, too. Both have set a new bar for production values in games, and the PC release, unconstrained by some slightly aging tech in the PS4 and Xbox One, absolutely sings.The voice acting, and the performances in general, are out-of-this-world good. It’s not a new thing for voice actors to sound good in games: professionals such as Troy Baker or Laura Bailey (her Gears 5 Kait is a recent highlight) have been doing the job a long time and are masters of their craft. But it seems only lately that believable characters are coming through.Red Dead Redemption 2’s characters are entirely believable. From Arthur Morgan to Dutch, you feel the shades of grey. You know they’re good people who’ve done bad things, and sometimes they’re also just bad people who are making others around them worse. There’s an allegory for the times we live in, buried deep in the story, I’m sure, but every time I’ve played through Red Dead 2 (PC being my third time) I’ve fallen hard for the people, the places, the design.It’s methodical, or to some people, slow. In many ways, were the release periods further apart, you might think Death Stranding was influenced by RDR2. It’s a game that many might argue; doesn’t respect your time, but the magic is in how it allows you to exist in its own time. Red Dead 2’s fast travel unlocks very late, and in two and a half playthroughs I used it about 3 times. You could rush, you could fly through and miss every side-quest, or you could allow time to stop existing around you, not worry about the latest ten games that have hit Steam, and indulge in a true gaming masterpiece.But you know all of this, having read the reviews when it came to PS4 and Xbox One. What we’ve got here is a version of RDR2 that gives you a far superior frame-rate. Playing in 60fps when you’ve played it before is almost strange: this is a game I’ve invested over a hundred hours of, and it felt like playing it anew. The visuals are startling in their beauty, too. Don’t get me wrong, the game is a looker wherever you play it, but on PC it is a visual masterclass in real world design in gaming. This is a game that’s so pretty you’d swear ray tracing was involved, even when it isn’t. There are moments that appear photo-realistic, with detailed plant-life, incredible horizons that don’t appear to pop in – the draw distance is superb. I’m not a huge fan of photo modes in games, but there’s a detailed one present here, for those of you that love to tinker. It’s no surprise it looks this good, of course, but the 100+ GB download (even bigger than the previous versions) is justified when you see it in motion.Control wise, you might not like this, but it’s probably best played with a controller. In the past I’d have maybe marked a game down for having mouse and keyboard controls that weren’t great, but in 2019 I feel almost everyone who cares about playing on a PC has a controller hooked up for some games, and reverts to mouse & keys for others. Truth be told, there are so many controls in Red Dead Redemption 2 that it feels a little strange having multiple keys for all manner of things. That said, the precision of a mouse to aim is a boon, and options are always good.Normally I’d say it’s hard to recommend buying something for a second time if you own it already. But within the tutorial section I was already invested and felt the draw to keep myself in RDR2’s world again. It’s not a small time investment, but it’s a rewarding one that showcases the very best design gaming has to offer.If you’ve been holding out for the PC version, your wait has been worth it. With a burgeoning online mode that, although not quite there yet, is well on the way, and a fifty hour campaign to get through with emotional highs and lows, this is an even better version of one of the best games of this generation. Once upon a time people would overuse the word “epic”, but it’s a phrase truly befitting of Rockstar’s brilliant Red Dead Redemption 2.Incredible voice acting and visuals

Red Dead Redemption 2,Brandon Adams,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/red-dead-redemption-2-for-pc-review/,"Like the Van Der Linde gang fleeing east, Red Dead Redemption 2 for PC has had a rocky, if not tumultuous, start. From issues that kept people from opening the game, the new Rockstar launcher imploding and pulling folk out of the game, the game itself crashing, and general confusion and debate over the overall optimization of the game, you’d be forgiven for assuming Red Dead Redemption 2 for the PC has been a dumpster fire. And, to be absolutely honest, the first week essentially was. But, the flames have been largely quieted via multiple updates, and it seems more people are able to get into the game and see for themselves if this port is worth their time and money. After spending the last week with Red Dead Redemption 2 for PC it has proven itself the premier way to experience the game, but there are a few caveats.Last year Rockstar reaffirmed its continued dominance as the best developer of open-worlds in the industry, with Red Dead Redemption 2 not only being one of the most graphically beautiful games on console, but featuring a world that was slavishly, if not a touch over-indulgently,  detailed. Stampeding across the open plains of the Heartlands into the foggy swamps and bayous of Lemoyne upon horseback often felt transcendent, as the wide landscape of wild grass and rolling hills gave way to muddy trails and dense fog in what felt natural in transition. Even on a base PS4, the world of Red Dead Redemption 2 planted its feet firmly on the ground, and screamed far and loud it was the best damn looking world ever crafted in a video game.Of course, there were all sorts of tricks and technical wizardry employed by Rockstar to get this massive of a game looking so damn fine, like the intelligent use of depth of field to mask the game’s level of detail pop-in, or using reduced shadows and volumetrics that still managed to give each environment a distinctly realistic look while maintaining a mostly stable thirty frames-per-second across the breadth of the experience (though, the bustling city of Saint Denis often strained even the Xbox One X). Red Dead was a technical showcase one year ago, and with its debut on the much more capable PC platform, Rockstar felt this was as fine a time as any to allow the game to punish whatever hardware you threw at it.And trust me when I say punish is the right word. Red Dead Redemption 2 for PC is a resource hog, if you allow it to be. It can also be a bit disingenuous, concerning what sort of performance you should expect at certain settings. While the game may feature thirty-nine different graphical settings for players to tweak, and a preset slider with 21 options based around your specific GPU, it doesn’t exactly communicate the exact performance impact of each. Sure, the usual resource dumps are here chewing up frames as you’d expect (shadows and volumetrics come to mind), but other settings can eat upwards of fifteen-percent or more of your performance with a single slide to the right in quality.Thanks to thorough testing among both the community and the press, the heaviest hitters have been identified and we all have a better idea what each setting does to performance, but I still feel Rockstar fumbled the ball a bit here. Gears of War 4 and 5 offer as many various graphical knobs and sliders, and The Coalition breaks each one down to not only their base descriptions, but their predicted performance impacts for the CPU, GPU, and even your RAM. This sort of granularity allows players to better identify what settings they should first focus on reigning in, and which settings they can safely pump up to find that perfect performance-quality balance for their computer. In Red Dead Redemption 2 for PC this sort of nuance wouldn’t have been too difficult to add, and I think the opaqueness of the graphical settings has contributed towards the “is this game well optimized?” debate currently raging online.Nor does it help that it wasn’t truly until the weekend after launch we finally had a definitive list of console-equivalent settings. Most PC ports seem to settle around the Medium-High settings range for console equivalency, with mid-range PC hardware delivering similar visuals but vastly better performance. Going into launch, most players were surprised to find that the same assumed mix of Medium to High settings in Red Dead did not deliver the expected results: performance on even high range cards like the 2080 ti felt decidedly neutered. Pair this perceived discrepancy with the launcher failures, game crashes, generally obtuse graphical settings, and a benchmarking tool that provides jack-all in terms of information (you get framerate data, and that’s it) it’s little surprise to see the subreddit and forums decrying Red Dead Redemption 2 for PC as a poorly optimized port.In the Air Force we were often told that, “perception is reality.” It was to remind us that, despite what may actually be the truth, what people saw quickly became the definitive story. At a glance it is indeed easy to write the game off as a lazy, rushed port. If you go into this game expecting at least Medium settings with dramatic performance gains over console you will be disappointed. Hell, anyone with a high-refresh rate monitor will likely walk away from this port grinding their teeth, considering it takes a 2080 ti at 1080p and low settings to break above one-hundred frames-per-second. But, this perception really only tells half the story, and it’s why I believe Rockstar should have been more transparent about performance, both in the game and outside of it.Thanks to the hard work from the ever reliable folks at Digital Foundry, it’s been shown that the majority of console-equivalent settings in the PC port are the lowest available settings (as compared to the Xbox One X I should note, which is arguably the best version of Red Dead available on console). Hell, some of the settings in the console version are set lower than the lowest PC settings, and Digital Foundry found that, when you set the game to those Xbox One X equivalent settings, performance would double on an AMD RX 580. The GTX 1060 lagged behind the RX 580 a substantial bit, but performance there was still an improvement over console.Okay, so what we have now is a situation where going to Low on mostly everything leads to console-equivalency. This is a bit of a break from the usual port pattern, where Low is typically below console-spec to allow older, weaker GPUs a chance at running the latest games. In Red Dead, console-spec is the minimum spec, while the majority of High to Ultra settings appear to be Rockstar’s attempt to future-proof the game. This is fine, all said, but I feel if Rockstar had better communicated performance expectations they could have avoided this whole debate outright. Even their press release concerning minimum and recommended hardware doesn’t list what settings and framerates to expect with those hardware configurations. Nvidia even came in before launch with their own recommendations to try and establish better expectations for the port. With even the graphics menu not sharing much information outside of a basic functionality description, Rockstar has lost complete control of the conversation.This isn’t me knocking the game’s performance, by the way, but more or less highlighting what potential buyers should bear in mind before they jump in. Because in Red Dead Redemption 2 for PC even the Low settings in this port are – with the exception of texture quality – still pretty damn beautiful. This all circles back to how well the console versions looked and ran, and it seems Rockstar felt confident enough with how well that spec performed that they decided to use it as the bare-minimum standard for the PC port. What this means is that, here in cold hard reality, Low settings in this port still provide an image quality that looks relatively amazing. Of course, that’s not true for every single setting (seriously, DO NOT turn textures down below High), and there were a few console-equivalents hovering around Medium and High in Digital Foundry’s analysis, but in the end Low is nowhere near being a bastard setting here as it is in many other ports.Though, lemme tell you, as pretty as Low settings can actually be, the game is a stunner if you are able to push into High and Ultra settings. Oddly enough, it seems most people can, because some of the settings see minimal performance difference between Low and High, sometimes even Ultra settings. Once you reel in the five meanest and hungriest of the settings, the other thirty-four can be dialed up on most systems to High. And trust me when I say you will notice the difference. Maybe not immediately; memory is a fickle mistress and Red Dead Redemption 2 was a stunner on console, but upon closer inspection it’s clear Rockstar did provide distinct visual upgrades with the PC port.Draw distances press forward until what seems the ends of the Earth, with trees and flora stretching on and on with surprising detail and clarity. Lighting and volumetrics become denser, sharper, and mimic reality in ways that made my night rides through the swamps of Lemoyne utterly surreal. Now that the community and press have figured out what the performance impact is for nearly every setting, most players will find they can go above the console-spec, and they will be duly rewarded with a game that borders on uncanny at times in its fidelity; a world that often masquerades successfully as a lifelike facsimile of our own.Of course, that’s not to say optimization is perfect; Nvidia cards seem to struggle more with performance when compared to similar AMD hardware (especially Pascal chips, which were built with DX11 in mind – an API not utilized in Red Dead Redemption 2 for PC), and four-core CPUs without hyper-threading seem prone to stuttering and hitching when the game decides to push them to 100% of their usage. Considering how much more additional strain some settings place on the GPU with even a single pip upwards demonstrates there is room for further improvements. The game does require additional patching and optimizations, there is no denying that.But, I think we can put to bed the notion that, as a whole, the port is poorly optimized. It stands to be better, but with the right expectations the port performs well across many different configurations. Rockstar simply failed to establish what those expectations should be, and this whole conversation could have been avoided had they set in stone what settings were associated with their published minimum and recommended specs, as well as shared what they thought were the console-equivalent settings, instead of waiting on Digital Foundry to do the work for them.Not every issue in Red Dead Redemption 2 for PC has to do with performance or poor communication; there are a few remaining problems that are associated with straight-up poor design choices or severe oversight. The UI is a mess of various keybindings and sketchy functionality, with the mouse being used to select items and options, but not always working as intended. Often you’ll find you’ve highlighted something in a menu, and the UI seems to indicate the game acknowledges your choice. However, the item description will either not update to what your mouse is hovering over, or the sub-menu you are trying to enter (like gun attachments, or horse equipment) will not register the clicks of your mouse, despite the element being highlighted and your cursor sitting firmly on top. In cases like this the game asks you to use the arrow keys, and they seem to override the mouse entirely, even if you haven’t pressed them. UI elements like color options ignore the mouse entirely, and you have to use the arrow keys to scroll through those selections.I’m still not sure if this is a bug, or a design oversight, but interacting with the menus using the mouse is an exercise in self-loathing. It’s clear Rockstar wanted the menus to work with mouse interactions, but the ability to use the keyboard in tandem seems to veto anything the mouse tries to do. Scrolling through a menu is equally laborious, because the game scrolls based on the highlighted element, so if your cursor is high on the screen the UI will stubbornly try and roll back up if you are scrolling down.More baffling about the mouse is input: the game is set to Raw Input by default, but using this method introduces stutter and slowdown when you pan the camera in game. Setting this to Direct Input resolves the slowdown, but the camera still feels floaty and sluggish until you – no shit – maximize mouse smoothing. You know, the setting any self-respecting PC gamer turns off immediately after motion blur.Resting awkwardly atop this issue, the game also defaults mouse and keyboard to auto-aim settings instead of the more appropriate Free Aim setting, and considering Red Dead Online matchmakes players based on which of these two settings they are using, it’s led to PC players wondering why they are getting gunned down so damn quickly in PvP firefights. Turns out it’s because they are matched against players using a controller, which has auto-aim so generous it can feel like you’re struggling against aim-bots as a mouse and keyboard player stuck in their lobby. All because Rockstar, for reasons beyond me, felt it necessary to make auto-freaking-aim the default setting on a PC title.I’ve also encountered more bugs in this port than I did in the console edition, many of which halted mission progress. One notable instance of this was when I was wrangling sheep with John Marston outside Valentine, and after we herded the woolly bastards into the auctioneer’s pen John stood rooted in place, refusing to mount his horse. Walking away did nothing to motivate John into leaving his roost, and I had to shoot the auctioneer to force a mission failure and reload from a checkpoint. By no means are the bugs and quibbly issues gamebreaking or terrible, but they left me scratching my head, considering most could have been avoided with some basic internal quality control. That, or I have to assume Rockstar had no faith in their shooting when they opted to make auto-aim the mouse and keyboard default.Once you dance around the performance debate and the minor issues within Red Dead Redemption 2 for PC, you’ll find yourself immersed in the same masterpiece console players and critics raved about last year. This is the same game from a content perspective, with nothing removed. As a matter of fact, Rockstar sweetened the pot a bit by throwing in an additional Stranger, gang hideout, and bounties to Story Mode, as well as added weapons from Online into the Story Mode. The most distinct addition, however, has to be the new Photo Mode available in the Story Mode.At any time you can press F6 to pause the game and utilize the new Photo Mode. You can be out in the world, or in a cutscene; it doesn’t matter. Press the button at the exact moment you want to capture and the tool pops up immediately. It offers a bevy of options, from standards such as zoom and brightness, to a myriad collection of filters, lens, and other options. While there has always been an in-game camera Arthur could pull out for screenshotting purposes, it did not possess as robust a toolkit as Photo Mode does. The camera is still there for those who wish to use it, but Photo Mode largely replaces it.I’m not normally one to slow down and capture images within the games I play, unless I am covering them (those articles don’t provide screenshots for themselves). With Photo Mode, however, I found myself slowing down on occasion to capture and preserve the moment to moment beauty within this game. Perhaps it’s the jaw-dropping visuals motivating me to stop and take it all in, or maybe it’s the simplicity of using the tool. Either way, I’ve found myself taking more screenshots for myself in Red Dead Redemption for PC, and after browsing around the subreddit and forums, I think it’s safe to say the new Photo Mode is a hit.I won’t lie; I oscillated heavily between opinions with this port. The disastrous launch left a poor first impression, and fumbling around the graphics settings for benchmarking purposes did nothing to alleviate my mood. But, as I sat down to play, and the game became more stable, I found myself once again fully enamored by Red Dead Redemption 2. This is a game I was infatuated with last year, but never got a chance to finish due to a deployment I had earlier this year. I came home ready to conclude Arthur’s story, but with the PC rumors becoming louder and louder with each passing day I opted to wait. And, here we are, the port is finally real and out in the wild.The PC launch has been far from flawless – that is the stark truth – but when the game works, and you have the performance locked in as you prefer, damn is this a hard game to hate. I know it’s pace and single-minded dedication to realism wasn’t everyone’s brand of whiskey last year, and that will not change with Red Dead Redemption 2 for PC. This is by and large the same game, the same somber tale of Arthur Morgan and the Van der Linde gang as they try and navigate a wild west being tamed by industrial America. If you weren’t a fan of it last year, the move to PC will not convert you. If you’re an existing fan, or a PC enthusiast who decided to wait on this inevitable port, then Red Dead Redemption 2 for PC will often prove itself as the definitive way to play the game.It looks and runs better than the console versions, even at most of it’s lowest settings. You have the benefit of true mouse and keyboard aiming, though you need to fumble with the settings a bit to unlock that potential proper. This port is not without it’s faults, and it has to be noted that even at the time of this review there are still those out there that can’t get around Rockstar’s launcher errors, or keep the game from crashing.Yet, when everything clicks, Red Dead Redemption 2 for PC is a solid port, just not a perfect one. Largely carried by the fantastic quality of the game itself, the port does at least provide prettier visuals, additional content, and a fantastic new Photo Mode. That all said, as solid as the port may be in most regards, it may be best to give Rockstar until the Steam launch in a month to iron out the last of the major issues. At that point, it’ll be easier to see and believe why I feel this is truly the best way to experience the end of the outlaw era for yourself.      
Attack of the Fanboy / GAME REVIEWS / Red Dead Redemption 2 for PC Review"
Red Dead Redemption 2,Chris White,God is a Geek,https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/red-dead-redemption-2-review/,"October 26, 2018When Rockstar Games release their latest title, they don’t just release something we can play, they release something we exist in – something we become. Everything they create pushes the boundaries of what we’ve grown to expect in video games, refusing to put limitations on what we can and can’t do, always allowing us to become the person – or people – we spend so much of our time with by immersing us in their world. Red Dead Redemption 2 is the most important video game of the year, maybe of the generation. There are so many systems involved, all merged together to make your time as Arthur Morgan as realistic and compelling as it can be, and so much of the story offers you freedom to play exactly how you want to; this is a game-changer, people.The 19th century is coming to an end, and the Wild West is evolving with the times. America is harnessing technology and economic growth through the advancements made by its pioneers, leaving many behind in its wake. Arthur Morgan and the Van der Linde gang are struggling to adapt, and after a robbery goes badly, they’re forced to leave their home and buy into the great manifest destiny of America. Maybe things can be better, maybe there’s hope in the honesty the new world is promoting, and maybe adapting to it is the best way forward. Your main goal is to survive the American heartland by any means necessary, and time after time you’re pushed to the very limits, whether that’s through rival gangs threatening you at every turn, the federal government watching your every move, or the punishing nature of harsh weather conditions and wild animals that will do everything they can to survive too.As Arthur Morgan, you have plenty of opportunities to do right by the Van der Lindes. You’ll find a settlement for your gang, and quickly learn how imperative it is to keep everyone alive by supplying them with food, medical supplies, and ammunition. You’ll have to rob trains, steal stagecoaches, hold up shopkeepers and civilians on the road, as well as complete missions, hunt animals, or complete bounty missions to earn your keep. On top of this, there’re plenty of other ways to earn money, such as games of Blackjack or Poker, and selling your wares to those that are interested. Your camp has a group fund to which you can donate your money, as well as a ledger where you can spend that hard-earned cash to improve the camp by upgrading living quarters, building better supply stores, and opening up the option to fast travel across the vast plains.By keeping your camp healthy and stocked up, the benefits to your own character quickly become noticeable. If you keep the medical supplies high, the health tonics are in abundance, and if you manage the upkeep of your camp well, others will be encouraged to work harder and donate more frequently. Whilst at first it takes a while to get your head around it all, it won’t be long before you’re heading home after a hard day’s work and decide a quick hunt before bed wouldn’t be a bad thing because you haven’t donated a tasty White-tailed deer for a while. These people are your friends, and the more you get to know them, the more you feel the desire to help keep them alive. Whether it’s Dutch Van der Linde, Hosea Matthews, or Pearson, you quickly become close, and helping to keep the gang alive becomes your number one priority.Out in the wild, or engulfed in a mission, the three cores of your character need to be kept replenished if you want to survive. Health, Stamina, and Dead Eye all need to remain high or you’ll start to show signs of fatigue. You don’t just need to keep your cores full, but the bars around them that act as standard meters need to remain filled or your performance will suffer. There are lots of ways to fill the cores and the bars, but with so many products to use it can be difficult to know which ones to stock, especially if you’re just finding them in an abandoned farmhouse or from looting a dead enemy. Freezing temperatures can affect your health greatly, so wearing something appropriate will keep it from deteriorating.It isn’t just Arthur that has these cores. Your horse is an extension of you, and looking after it can sometimes be a ‘mare (my God – Ed). As long as you have enough food in your provisions, and remember to keep him or her clean, you’ll be OK. It’s important to bond with your horse because you’ll have access to better abilities. For example, if you’re bonded with your horse it’ll come to you from a farther distance once you whistle it to return. You can tame wild horses, or buy from one of the town’s stables, allowing you the option to choose a variety of them to help aid you differently in certain missions. You can also name them, which strengthens the bond still further.Your horse also acts as your inventory whilst exploring, and remembering to equip yourself properly before leaving them can often be forgotten. Once you step off your horse, you can press the left shoulder button to select whether you need a bow or a repeater, as well as choose which health items you’ll need depending on the type of mission you’re undertaking. Throughout the game you’ll be able to buy lots of different weapons, as well as finding them and being given them as part of certain missions, so you’ll never be at a loss when choosing which one you take into battle. Like your horse, they’ll also need maintaining, so cleaning them from time to time replenished their stats and keeps them as good as new.It’s a straightforward system when using the weapons and items, and switching between what you have equipped is done by holding the left shoulder button and selecting with the analogue. Much like the first game, the cover system is employed by pressing the right shoulder button behind a rock, wagon, wall, or whatever’s close by, and just as important as it’s ever been. Perhaps the most useful tool is Dead Eye, but making sure you keep it topped up with Snake Oil or the occasional cigar means you’ll have it for those intense shootouts. At some points in the game, you’ll get into a position where you have to fire off precise shots in situations where gunfights aren’t an option. Holding the right trigger softly will fill up a gauge, then once it’s filled you’ll have time to pick off enemies through Dead Eye; the softer you press it, the more time you get to take out enemies more efficiently. It can be tricky at first, but once you get the hang of it, it’s a great device.Hunting is a huge part of RDR2, as is fishing, and both can be done whenever you like. There are 178 different species of animals, so that gives you a lot of opportunities to provide food for your gang. Hunting with the bow will provide stealth, but using it on a smaller animal can ruin the quality of the pelt, thus meaning the reward will be less. You can get smaller arrows for smaller animals, which can be purchased in local towns. Of course, you have the faithful lasso to capture prey, but it’s not going to work against a grizzly bear or an alligator. Planning every hunt is just as important as robbing a train, and learning which options are at your disposal can take time, but planning that next big kill proves incredibly satisfying when done correctly. Fishing can also get you some great food for your camp, and there are lots of different baits to use which’ll help you capture a wide range of fish. Standing on the edge of a river and casting your line is a necessity for acquiring a supper, but it’s also therapeutic and a great distraction from the trials and tribulations of being a criminal.There is so much to do in RDR2 that you’ll never get bored. It’s one of those games that has a never-ending supply of water cooler moments. You may have a mission you want to do, but along the way you encounter a member of one of the gangs and overhear them planning on a heist. I found myself intervening with a bunch of them after hijacking a stagecoach, only to kill them myself and loot their gains. Elsewhere, I bumped into two chaps sat at a campfire who asked me if I could help them find some supplies. I decided to rob them instead, but a huge chase with the law quickly ensued. There are strangers all over Rockstar’s America, and you can interact with them however you want to. Be antagonistic and abusive, or be polite and let them pass by – it’s up to you. Each person has their own idiosyncrasies, and every town or settlement you encounter has its own personality. You also have a morality meter that moves towards good and bad depending how you act, so be careful with every action because it can affect how others treat you.You may be in Valentine and hear a load of drunken fools talking about the good ol’ days, or pass through a local farm to hear a rivalry escalating between the farmers and some local thugs wanting to take it off their hands. One of my favourite things was when I returned to the doctor’s office in Valentine a few days after I had a massive gunfight there. I’d uncovered some shady goings on in a back room, and he didn’t like it at all. I paid the bounty off on my head and returned to the doctor to buy supplies, and he said he’d rather have this go smoother than the last time. It showed that people remember, and highlighted how special this world is.When you’re roaming through the woodlands at night, and the moonlight breaks through the trees, or a thunderstorm splits the sky as you watch from the comfort of your bed, the visual wonder of Red Dead Redemption 2 is utterly arresting. The weather systems are stunning, ranging from sandstorms to gorgeous sunlight, from torrential rain to snowy blizzards. The day/night cycle provides more realism to everything you do, and knowing that it’s almost midnight and you’re far from home gives you a reason to pitch a tent and start a campfire. You’ll often find yourself away from your gang’s camp, so finding somewhere to sleep is important, mainly because sleeping refills your health core and sets you up nicely for the next day. You can also cook meals on the fire, and pitch a tent to get some much needed shut eye.Everything about Red Dead Redemption 2 takes your breath away. Movement can sometimes feel clunky, like many Rockstar Games can, and remembering to put your gun away when talking to innocent people could have an easier way to do go about it, but complaints are minimal. The way everything exists in its own routine, the way combat is so varied and tactical, the way you literally have an endless supply of things to keep you occupied – it’s so good. The visuals are sublime, and the voice acting from every single member of the cast makes this game feel so grand. Little touches like the cinematic camera angles, or the moments in which you get a great shot in and the camera triggers a short cinematic to see it hit, or how you can tackle the same mission in two different ways depending on what you decide, is wonderful. So much care and consideration has gone in to making this game a modern masterpiece, and it shows at every turn. We’ll be talking about this game for many years to come.Become a Patron!Such a vibrant living world

Red Dead Redemption 2,William Schwartz,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/red-dead-redemption-2-review/,"Rockstar Games has long been the master of the open world game.  After all, it was Grand Theft Auto that popularized the genre all those years ago and things have just been getting bigger and bigger ever since.  Rockstar’s own titles in the Grand Theft Auto series have been getting more massive with each iteration, but in 2010 they tried their hand with a Wild West setting that had largely been untouched.  Red Dead Redemption brought a lot to the table, even if it took a lot from the GTA series.  It had everything that an open world wild west game should have and plunged players into the shoes of a retired outlaw named John Marston and had him tracking down his old running mates.  This time, Red Dead Redemption 2 takes the lead, forging its own path in the open world genre by introducing new mechanics to the Rockstar open world formula and the result is nothing short of astounding.Despite being called Red Dead Redemption 2, their latest game is a prequel to Red Dead Redemption.  John Marston is not the main playable character this time around.  Instead, players will be playing the role of Arthur Morgan across the course of the game’s massive six chapter affair.  Morgan is a running mate of Dutch Van Der Linde.  After a botched heist in the familiar town of Blackwater, the gang is being tracked by the Pinkerton Detective Agency across this sprawling open world.  Being on the run, the Van Der Linde gang is seemingly always one good score away from freedom.  Being a prequel to Red Dead Redemption you already know how this story ends.  Red Dead Redemption 2 is story of how everyone got to where they were at the start of the Red Dead Redemption and how John Marston turned from the hunted to the hunter.Red Dead Redemption 2 is a much different game than the last one though.  There has been so much added to the experience this time around.  While there are still many of the tried and true staples of the Rockstar open world game.  There are some hardcore survival game elements at play here.  What’s most surprising is the cohesiveness of it all.  The challenges that developers face with the open world genre is that trying to tell a story while giving the player absolute freedom makes for somewhat of a disjointed experience.  In Red Dead Redemption 2, the player is in control of every facet of their survival.  From the micromanagement of their body temperature and huger levels, to the overarching health of the gang’s cash coffers and every thing in between.  There are so many different systems at play here, Red Dead Redemption 2 is an absolute marvel and new high bar for the genre.  It’s the ultimate ‘see that mountain, you can go to it’, game.  Not only can you go to it, but you can kill every man, woman, and beast on the way and change the world in the process.The game is all about Morgan’s internal conflict.  As we said before, we know where the story is headed each step of the way.  The decisions that you make will change your experience though.  From weather to music, your actions in the world influence your specific playthrough.  There is only one way that the story can go, but on this journey you’ll see your friend and father figure, Dutch Van Der Linde descend into madness, taking bigger and bigger risks in his quest for freedom.  This leads the story experience to be a heist game largely.  You’ll be pulled into dangerous missions that have you losing friends along the way while never quite getting enough to start anew. Despite all of the new survival features that Red Dead 2 offers, the basic structure of the game will be familiar to Rockstar fans.  Visit markers on the map of a certain color and you’ll proceed down the main path of the story.  There’s a decent variety to the story missions, but they will mostly boil down to shooting a lot of people.  While the major plot points are going to be the same for most people, the way that they get there is going to differ wildly due to the sheer amount of side activities in the game.  On these main path missions come the biggest complaints from us.  There’s a restrictive nature that contrasts wildly to the freedom you have when exploring.  They’ve usually got you following someone or riding with a group for lengthy segments, and while it does give you a chance to take in the world, it can get a little long in the tooth before it’s all said and done.Once the action kicks off, Red Dead Redemption 2 is a blast though.  The shooting mechanics and Dead Eye system return and it’s as good as it was in the last game.  Morgan can slow down time with this mechanic and perform amazing shots with a variety of sidearms, rifles, and shotguns, often times getting treated to slow motion kill shots that can be incredibly violent.  There’s a deliberate pace to the gun play that feels great when using the Dead Eye system or standard targeting, all the while utilizing a cover system that will keep you out of harm’s way.  You’ll have to shoot people in the story missions, but when you’re out in the open world the way you interact with people is entirely up to you.Over time you’ll become more and more proficient as you level up your different attributes like health, stamina, and your dead eye abilities.  There is a ton of micromanagement in Red Dead Redemption 2 and it lends to the authenticity and cohesion of the experience. You’ll not only be managing the aforementioned things like your body temperature and cash flow, but you’re also wrangling with your honor, bounties that the law will set on you, as well as your relationship with your horse.  Each and every thing in Red Dead Redemption 2 feels like its reactive to the player choice.  Whether that be whether you choose to take the high road in conflicts, or solve things with your weapon, whether you choose to push your horse to its absolute breaking point, or stay on the beaten path.  There is nothing but choices to be made and you’ll constantly be faced with the consequences of your actions.This is where Red Dead 2 is at its absolute best — when it gives the player the freedom to explore and interact with the world on their terms.  The good news is, this is all the time.  From the very beginning of the game you are free to do whatever it is that you want, go out into the world and explore it to your content and then come back to the story missions when you feel like it.  And you’ll find plenty to do out there.  Random encounters with strangers will set you out on unexpected adventures.  In fact, after playing the game for well over 70 hours, we’re still finding people out there that are in need of a little help.  But it’s not just these random encounters, there are a ton of collectibles to uncover.  There are a bunch of weapons to find or buy, outfits to collect, animals to hunt, or secrets to uncover.  Upon the completing of this review I was sitting at around 83% percent complete, and up until this point there hasn’t been an end to new encounters.The world of Red Dead Redemption 2 truly is a marvel.  It features a fully recreated map of most of the previous game, as well as the new area which is about twice as big.  It’s absolutely massive.  Riding a horse from one side to the other will take you quite a bit of real world time, seeing every nook and cranny will take you awhile.  There are snowy mountains, an Indian Reservation, a modern city modeled after New Orleans, a gator infested swamp, plantations, rolling plains, and just about every sort and of course the southwestern climates of the previous game.  With these unique areas, there’s also a ton of different weather scenarios that you’ll encounter with misting rain storms, blizzards, bright sunny days, and cloudy, gloomy moments.  On the weather and terrain fronts, Red Dead Redemption 2 has just about everything you can imagine.  And it looks amazing at that.  Just riding or walking around this world is enjoyable if just for the combination of music and visuals, it’s simply a joy to explore in this game and stumble upon these random encounters, landmarks, and people.What’s likely the most impressive thing is how all of these systems work in concert.  There were only a handful of moments in these many hours that I spent with the game where I saw the same thing twice.  That is, these unique moments that give the game a layer of realism. Sure, you’ll have similar experiences in the game, but how you react to them can be vastly different.  While you may perform a robbery and get away clean in one instance.  In another, a witness to your crimes may make it to lawmen who establish a bounty on your head as a result.  Which can quickly spiral into being chased across the country side by horseback riders and scent sniffing dogs.  The sandbox freedom that Red Dead Redemption 2 offers to players is unparalleled.  The choices are completely up to you, but the consequences must also be dealt with.Whatever it is that you come to open world games for, Red Dead Redemption 2 has it.  It’s a massive game that will take you many hours to see the credits roll, but you could spend many, many more hours in the open world just playing with the many systems at play here.  And it’s wholly satisfying.  From the way it runs in to Red Dead Redemption, to the cast of characters and varied missions and seemingly endless side content, there’s just so much good here that it far outweighs any of the bad.  What’s more, is that our review of Red Dead Redemption 2 only included the single player portion of the game.  With the world being such a shining star here, we’re incredibly excited about the possibility of what Red Dead Online will offer and how it can extend this already massive game into something even greater.With Red Dead Redemption 2 Rockstar Games has set the bar so high that other games of this nature seem infinitesimally lesser because of its existence.

Red Dead Redemption 2,Dean Takahashi,GamesBeat,https://venturebeat.com/2018/11/06/red-dead-redemption-2-review-goodbye-to-the-american-west/view-all/,"Connect with top gaming leaders in Los Angeles at GamesBeat Summit 2023 this May 22-23. Register here.Red Dead Redemption 2 main character Arthur Morgan dreams about animals, like a deer moving in slow motion in the wilderness. With the melancholy music, the scene with the deer helps implant the theme of sadness about the vanishing of the outlaw life in the epic Western video game from Rockstar Games.That Rockstar’s storytellers linger with such moments (as you see in the video here) in the course of a very long game sets this apart from any other I’ve played. It is full of stories and subplots that by themselves would be the basis for an entire game if it another studio had made it.Arthur is a character who is depicted in depth in this game, and he is one of the rare outlaws who lives by a code. However his story turns out, the larger tragedy is about the disappearance of a way of life and a disillusionment with what America became in the industrial age.That deer in the dream is a symbol or premonition of some kind of death. But what happens if someone else playing the game sees a wolf instead? That is one of the many things that will make you wonder here.GamesBeat Summit 2023Join the GamesBeat community in Los Angeles this May 22-23. You’ll hear from the brightest minds within the gaming industry to share their updates on the latest developments.But even as the story takes you on this long ode to the outlaw, it doesn’t glorify the outlaw life. Rather, from the beginning as the gang is in full retreat after a botched robbery, it shows in full color what can go wrong as you cling to romantic lies about the lawless frontier.This is my full review of Red Dead Redemption 2. I wrote earlier about my impressions when I was about halfway through the game. But now I can see it in full relief. I think I can explain in this lengthy piece why it’s on its way to selling 20 million copies or more.I think it fits alongside Rockstar’s masterpieces such as 2010’s Red Dead Redemption and 2013’s Grand Theft Auto V. And it takes the story and depth one step farther, as far as this generation’s game consoles can take it.The world feels alive. It has 10 times the custom animations of GTA V. It has 300,000 individual animations, 1,000 things to do and discover, 500,000 lines of dialogue (or twice the number in GTA V), and more than 1,000 actor performances in the game. (Yes, it is no wonder Rockstar is facing allegations of involuntary crunch, or forced overtime).I was amazed at the breadth of the experience. I’ve completed 105 missions (I remember GTA V had 69 missions total), and I am 100 percent done with the story. I’ve also reviewed the video I captured of the game to better understand how it all comes together. It takes more than 50 hours to get through that directed part of the game, but there are many more hours you can spend in the open world if you want to explore all of its edges, side missions, and emergent gameplay.Above: Arthur Morgan strikes out on his own in a lot of missions.The game left me with a lot to think about. In some ways, the storytellers’ hands were tied. It takes place in 1899, as a prequel to 2010’s Red Dead Redemption, which took place in 1911. If you played the original game, you know who survived from Dutch Van der Linde’s notorious gang, including Red Dead Redemption’s main character, John Marston, who plays a secondary role as one of many gang members in Red Dead Redemption 2.While the original focuses on Marston, this game focuses on Arthur Morgan and his interactions with all of the characters in the gang. At the center is the charismatic outlaw leader, Dutch Van der Linde,
who, in contrast to his rival Colm O’Driscoll, tries to justify his violence and greed with higher ideals about resistance, freedom, and the extended family of the cult-like gang.Dutch is like a snake-oil salesman, always getting his gang to believe that one more heist will yield enough money so they can move to some far-off paradise where they won’t be pursued by the law anymore. Arthur is his loyal enforcer who starts to question just what loyalty means as his leader becomes more and more erratic.From the start, Rockstar paints the gang without glamour. It tests loyalties after a bank robbery goes bad in the town of Blackwater. They have fled into the mountains under cover of a blizzard, and they are searching for their scattered gang members. They are desperate for food and money, and Arthur must provide.Marston is among the missing. Finding him is one of your first tasks playing as Arthur. The beginning is kind of plodding, but you learn important things like how to ride a horse, track an animal or human in the wild, and hunt. The group sets up camp and you try to help improve the common good by hunting and providing and protecting. And the gang must be ever vigilant about evading federal agents, bounty hunters, and private armies like the Pinkertons.Above: Dancing by the pale moonlight.It also has better artificial intelligence that appears to sense what you are thinking, particularly in the open world part of the game, rather than the directed story missions.What this means is that if you follow a nonplayer character into an alley, they will look back at you and start to worry that you mean ill intent. The character will question you or stop walking to confront you. If you have a bounty on your head, the passersby may recognize you and report your presence. If you pass by someone with your gun drawn, they may react in a hostile way. You can defuse confrontations with strangers, or you can antagonize them into attacking you.If you are known for shooting up a town and then paying off the bounty, the survivors will treat you with disdain. Every now and then, when you are shooting someone, or when you are riding in the wild, or when an important part of the story unfolds, the camera goes into a cinematic mode. When you walk by two women having a conversation, they will begin to include you in the chatter.All of this helps you feel like you are immersed in a living world.Check out our Reviews Vault for past game reviews.An epic storyAbove: Red Dead Redemption 2 is an epic adventure.I’ve already mentioned the living-world cliché. And I don’t always like to throw around the word “epic,” as that’s what marketing departments do in just about every description of any video game. But Rockstar has set itself apart with the quality of its stories. You can find pathos in the loss of the freedom and frontier lifestyle that forms the backdrop to the tale. While they’re not nice people, you spend so much time with them that you want to see them fulfill their dreams of escape.Just when I thought I was getting a little bored, a new kind of mission appeared. Every now and then, a big twist takes the story in a new direction, and it reminds me that the Rockstar team has some awesome storytellers. I loved getting to know the characters in the gang and viewing life from what otherwise would be viewed as a villain’s point of view. You can get to know the members of the gang during missions, where you can tell if they’re cowardly or brave, or you can spend time talking to them in a more relaxed setting in the outlaw camp.Arthur was adopted into the gang at a young age, and he is one of the few who has been with the group forever, compared to some who have only been on board for a few months. Arthur buys into Dutch’s dream of living free from the law and societal interference. Dutch treats Arthur like a son, but the gang has a lot of baggage, and Arthur has to decide how much he is willing to follow Dutch. Arthur also has to make choices that tell you whether he’s an honorable outlaw or a dirty scoundrel.A gang of charactersAbove: Red Dead Redemption 2 stars Arthur Morgan (left) and gang leader Dutch Van Der Linde.While Arthur and John are like Dutch’s adopted sons, they don’t get along. Arthur takes a sour view of many things, and he loves to insult his fellow gang members, but he gets along well with the kindhearted ones. He is loyal to Dutch, but he also begins to see through Dutch’s lies. While Arthur has lost his chance for romance, he sees hope in Marston’s family, with his wife Abigail and son Jack.The gang’s wide cast includes women who can trick men out of their money, a bookish loan shark named Leopold Strauss, a carnival-like con man named Josiah Trelawny, and an aging, wise, and cautious gangster named Hosea Matthews.Sadie Adler blooms late in the story, but she becomes one of Rockstar’s more memorable female characters. There are shifty characters like Micah Bell, Bill Williamson, and Javier Escuella, and trustworthy ones like Charles Smith, Lenny Summers, and Susan Grimshaw.On the side of the law, there are relentless pursuers like the industrialist Leviticus Cornwall, who seeks vengeance because Dutch has robbed from him so much, and the Pinkerton agent Andrew Milton. While Dutch evades the law, he must also be wary of rival gang leader Colm O’Driscoll.As you get to know these characters, they reveal more about the kind of man who Arthur has become, and how he’s different from the likes of Marston and Dutch. And by the end of the story, you’ll see how different characters come to the foreground and why they are there. Diversity of missions and placesAbove: Think there’s some big bucks in that stagecoach?The story crosses so many regions, like snowy mountains and swamps. You never get lost, as the main story missions show up as yellow dots on the map.I loved going on missions like a train robbery, a bank heist, or a chase through the woods. You also have random adventures you can pursue. These don’t advance the story, but you can get more resources from them (by looting the enemies you kill) and come face-to-face with interesting moral choices, like whether you should help an escaped convict get out of his chains.The gang gets chased around multiple states in the fictional American West, and each time it is forced to move, a new chapter in a new place begins. You can explore the snowbound mountain trails of the East Grizzlies, the grassy plains of the heartlands, treacherous alligator-filled swamps, the rapidly modernizing city of St. Denis in the Southeast, as well as the classic Southwest frontier. You’ll also go to a number of places you wouldn’t expect to see in a Western.With so many missions, you remember the ones that stand out. I recall the ones that involve a hot air balloon, a gator, a 1,000-pound bear, a sniper rife and an old feud, going fishing, jumping off a cliff, a fast-action canoe chase, shooting a Gatling gun on top of a train as an army bears down on you, and building a house.Amazing graphics and environmentsAbove: It’s more than the woods and plains.The tale begins in the snow-covered mountains amid a blizzard. Even on the aging PlayStation 4, the animations of snow particles blowing sideways in the wind look amazingly realistic. The animation of the human faces look superb. The motion captured movements also look real. When you move through the snow, you leave footprints and trails behind you.The music is stirring, and the developers included 192 separate pieces of original interactive score. The combined effect will make your jaw drop open. The soundtrack and the voice acting make a significant contribution to immersion.Since the world is huge, you’ll see a wide variety of environments, such as the mesas of the Old West or the industrial factories of modern cities. The facial animations and close-ups of the characters are also believable, getting over the challenge of the “uncanny valley,” or the notion that animated faces look weirder the more realistic they become. I came to think of the characters as people, not animated pieces of code.Just standing in place and watching the wind blow through the grass, you can see how much work Rockstar put into things like shadows, lighting, ambient sound, music, weather effects, and facial and body animation. The world is visually arresting and it is filled with things to do, and it has a lot of ambient sound and ambient life. I was running down a path, and I laughed when a pig charged up behind me and knocked me over.The user interface and controls are simpleAbove: This is basically like where GamesBeat’s Jeff Grubb lives.The screen isn’t cluttered with the usual video game heads-up display.When you need to pull up your inventory, you hit the left bumper and the weapon wheel appears. If you further squeeze the right trigger, you can then see a secondary wheel of items and then quickly select an item you want to use. When you don’t need to see the inventory, it disappears from view.This kind of weapon wheel and inventory system makes switching weapons during a gunfight simple and fast. The minimap could be bigger, as it feels a lot like a GPS that tells you at the last minute to make a sharp left turn.When you are in combat, you can target enemies with auto-aiming by squeezing the L2 trigger. But you have to move your right stick to target enemies more precisely. I learned to control the game quickly and fluidly, so that I never had to slow down much to accomplish certain tasks.That feeds the illusion that you are in a cinematic experience, more like a movie than a video game. When a cutscene comes, black borders appear and the top and bottom of the screen. I had an easy time learning how to ride a horse, as it’s a lot like playing GTA V, except with horses.(And yes, like with cars in GTA V, it’s quite easy to crash your horse). It feels like a lot of thought went into making the user interface less intrusive.Combat is deeply satisfyingAbove: Guns up!This is a game, not a movie, and you can tell that through the quality of the combat system. As you would expect, the Wild West of Red Dead Redemption 2 spawns a lot of combat opportunities. It is spaced across multiple missions, but every once in a while you get into a gigantic shootout.The Dead Eye system is back, and it allows you to shift a scene into slow motion for a limited period of time. During that time, you can target multiple enemies at once and shoot them all at once when the slow-motion returns to fast. When you are being chased on horseback, it’s easy to shift the view so that you can turn around and target your pursuers with pistol fire. If you leave yourself exposed in front of the AI enemy, you’ll die quickly.It’s not perfect combat, as you spend far too much time trying to auto-aim at enemies and then getting no results. Quite often you have to shoot foes four or five times to bring them down. But as you get used to the system, you’ll find yourself trying to get headshots just for the rewards. It has up 50 weapons, and you’ll learn how to use a lot of them. And sometimes, you’ll have more than 50 enemies to shoot in a single battle.Superb actingAbove: Red Dead Redemption 2.The voice acting for Dutch Van der Linde (Benjamin Byron Davis) and Arthur Morgan (Roger Clark) is first-rate. I’ve come to expect this from Rockstar’s games, but the quality of the facial animation and the voice acting that feeling of immersion. It’s part of making you care about the characters. The writing is memorable, and the cut scenes are expertly woven into gameplay.Strangers can be friendly or deadlyI stopped by to help a woman whose horse had died and fallen on her leg. It was out of the goodness of my heart. Then she needed a ride to St. Denis, the city halfway across the map. I took her home, and she rewarded me with a silver ring. But my reputation didn’t change, as far as I could see.Then I stopped to help a woman who was similarly stranded. Something didn’t look right, so I drew my rifle. She asked me to help. I did. Then she pulled a gun on me and two others came running at me out of the woods. I shot them all.You never know how one of those encounters will turn out, so you must assess the risk/reward of helping total strangers. It makes you cynical, and it keeps you on your toes at all times.Fast travel isn’t fastAbove: Get on the train!It wouldn’t have killed Rockstar to put better fast travel into the game. Its system isn’t fast at all. And with a map as huge as Red Dead’s, it’s a form of insanity not to make a way for a player to get from one end of the map to another to start the next mission.Train stations are a place where you can fast travel. But the tickets cost money. The stations aren’t always near where you want to go. And here’s the killer: If you take a train somewhere, you leave your horse behind. So when you arrive at the train station, you either steal another horse, or you walk. I never once took a train for this reason. And it cost me hours and hours of extended riding through the country. In a 50-hour game, that is maddening.So many other things slow you down. You track animals in slow motion. If you want to shave your beard off, you have to do it. If you want to move from one side of the camp to another, you can’t run. With so much emergent gameplay, I can see why Rockstar didn’t want to use fast travel. But they should have left the choice of using it up to the players.Occasional bugs reveal the game’s limitsJust when you think that you’re not in a video game, and this all seems so real, little bugs remind you that it’s not perfect. I parked my horse, and its head became stuck in a tree. My wagons became inextricably stuck in rock formations. One of my horses died because it was stuck in a rock. I tried to dock a boat alongside a ship, and it didn’t work. The horses have a habit of shaking back and forth, as if they were stuttering.It’s a big game, and a lot of the animations don’t look polished. Pathfinding is difficult, and so you rarely see all of the gang members together on missions. Usually, it’s just a couple of characters involved in most of the journeys. Every now and then, the targeting system seems really slow, like early in the game when you have to shoot a bunch of wolves. These flaws knock you out of the fantasy. Fortunately, if you think of the bugs per area of the game, or bugs per hour of gameplay, they are surprisingly rare.Some missions just waste your timeAbove: Nope. Not dead yet.One of the gang members Lenny comes rushing into camp, saying that Micah has been arrested and may be hanged. So Dutch tells Arthur to go out and rescue Micah. But first, Dutch says Lenny is so shaken up that Arthur should take him to the saloon to get drunk first.So they go get drunk and you waste a bunch of time, where Arthur can see straight and he has to search through the whole saloon to find someone who looks like Lenny. This happens several times, and you finally pass out and wake up.Meanwhile, Micah is just sitting in the jail in another town, awaiting a hanging or a rescue. I have no idea why this mission made the cut among the 105 mostly purposeful missions. I suppose it tells us something about the outlaw life — getting drunk. But it was painfully drawn out and not funny. This is one of those cases where you wish you could take control of the story, rather than have Rockstar control it for you.Your horse can be hard to controlAbove: Don’t jump off the cliff, horse.It’s hard to avoid pedestrians sometimes. You hit them with your horse and cause a major incident. Other bystanders will report you for an unarmed assault, and the law will come after you. They may kill you, or you may kill them. But either way, you will end up with a bounty on your head.And when you are riding fast through the wilderness, you occasionally will be unhorsed as you ram straight into a big rock or tree. This is a major unintended consequence of having realistic physics in the game. You can’t just put the brakes on the horse or your wagon easily, or turn on a dime, the way you can in Rockstar’s Grand Theft Auto games, where vehicle maneuvering is a lot more precise. I would have preferred no consequence at all for bumping into a rock.I got bounties on my head — or shot a few times — because I accidentally ran my horse into the people who were passing by on the narrow dirt trails of Red Dead Redemption 2. I also shot a horse out from under someone who was fleeing. That saved me from having to shoot the guy, but it mean that I later had a bounty on my head for animal cruelty.This taught me to be more careful, because the world reacts to my ineptitude, but I wished I could rewind these actions so that they weren’t so consequential. For instance, one of these simple screw-ups led me to losing my horse, which is like losing a character in the game. You can invest a lot in your horse, and if you lose it, you’ll feel sad. So steer it wisely. Small details don’t meshAt the end of a bank heist, I scored about $20,000. The share for the whole gang was around $12,000. That was a huge amount for the destitute group. But when I proceeded to play further, the gang still only had a few hundred dollars. That bank heist was tough, but I didn’t get the rewards. That didn’t make sense, as it should have been enough for our whole gang to escape to a better place.Dutch always says the gang needs more money, but he never says how much, or where the gang’s money disappears to every now and then. If I knew that, I would know how much stuff to steal in any given region. I felt like the failure to do proper accounting just stretched the story out longer, as Dutch could pretend we didn’t have money when we really did.Animations can be stiffAbove: Arthur makes riding a horse look easy in this screenshot.Nothing ruins the realism of a game as a lousy animation. Throughout the game, you see characters move in awkward ways, like they’re skating on the ground. I had a hard time tethering my horse sometimes. The characters may look perfect, but if they don’t move as humans do, or if they get in each other’s way. There’s often a lag between when you do something, like press a button to dismount, and when it actually happens. That makes you have to press the button again.Flawed narrative pathsIn the Lemoyne region, you come across two feuding families, both of them owners of plantations. There’s a Romeo and Juliet plot here, where one of the sons in one family falls in love with the daughter in the other family. Arthur plays messenger between them, working for pay. The whole story plays out and the feud gets worse.There’s a chance to unite the star-crossed lovers. But it is just a side mission. Since it wasn’t part of the main narrative, I never learned how that part of the story ended. This seemed like an obtuse outcome, as they should have told us what happened to Romeo and Juliet.There are also times when confrontations should result in one character being dead, the other standing. But Rockstar appears to want to drag out these confrontations across many more hours.Choices that aren’t real choicesAbove: John Marston was the hero of Red Dead Redemption, and he is back in Red Dead Redemption 2.You have an option to question a captive or beat a person. You can’t extract information nicely, and so your only choice is to be in character, an outlaw, and do what an outlaw would do. Arthur doesn’t seem to have as many choices to be good — or bad — as you might think in this open world. As Dutch says early in the game, “We’re bad men, but we ain’t them.”On the other hand, if you make a series of mistakes, you may be forced to give up your progress and start over. That’s because you may make the wrong calls and handicap your character. I found at one point that I had hundreds of dollars on my head, and that brought out the bounty hunters. If too many bounty hunters are on your trail, then you won’t be able to get anything done.So I had to spend a lot of time on schemes to come up with cash so I could pay my bounty. That was a challenge, and it made me wish the game didn’t remember so much about the dumb things I did. The point is that you can dig yourself a hole so deep that you may have to start over to progress further in the story. You almost feel like you are doomed to be an outlaw.Some mysterious stay mysteriousAbove: Arthur Morgan dreams of deer moving in slow motion.If you’re looking for an answer about why that deer keeps coming up in recurring dreams, you don’t really get an answer. Perhaps you see the deer if you’ve been good in your life. The game doesn’t explicitly explain itself to you. Nor do you get an explanation for why the epilogues go on the way they do. You’ll also wonder why the game ends the way it does.But this isn’t really something to complain about. With most games, you don’t have something to figure out. If you want things spelled out for you, you won’t get answers. But if you want to interpret things for yourself, you’ll like this aspect of the game.The above list may seem like a long list of things not to like. And hopefully, some of these illusion-breaking bugs will be stamped out with early patches. The bugs are unsettling, considering it took a huge team about eight years to make this game.But make no mistake: Red Dead Redemption 2 is a masterpiece. I see these flaws as small distractions, but they don’t kill my enthusiasm for the game. Those bugs seem like nitpicking against scenes like the one in the video above, as Arthur rides to the sound of a beautiful song.It is a long experience. Parts of it are tedious. It’s a big ask to get players who are accustomed to nothing but pure action to embrace a game like this which has a lot of dead time. But Rockstar sent a lot of messages with the full arc of the game. Like how violence isn’t always the answer. Like how the life and death of a gunslinger isn’t nearly as glamorous as we have all been taught. In some ways, these messages negate the Rockstar games that have come before it, as they have been awash in violence. Yet the messages were delivered skillfully, without heavy-handed storytelling.I loved so many things about this game, even down to the story in the final credits. It was sad to finish it, but so rewarding.Rockstar has done a brilliant job blending an open-world game experience with the freedom of discovery and balancing that with the tightly woven narrative. Nearly 3,000 people are listed as contributors to the game. I don’t know if we’ll see the like of this again.Red Dead Redemption 2 is an amazing work of art.Score: 96/100Red Dead Redemption 2 debuted on October 26 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

It's 4 a.m. in the morning and I can barely keep my eyes open. I'm tracking a potential meal for the folks back in camp following the delicate hoof marks my quarry has left in the brush. Spotting my prey, I slowly creep closer, trying to keep out of its line of sight while I line up my shot.I hold my breath as the tiny white reticle turns red, signaling I have the shot. I pull the bowstring taut and let my arrow fly. However, the whitetail deer moves its head just in time, sending my arrowing hurtling into the rock next to its head. Sufficiently spooked, my quarry sprints to safety. Eyes weary, I sigh and resume the hunt, marveling at how much fun I'm having.This is Red Dead Redemption 2, the much-anticipated sequel to Rockstar's beloved 2010 open-world Western. A game that took eight years to make, with thousands of pages of script and controversial, highly publicized 100-hour work weeks to bring to fruition. I'm four hours into the game and I can tell you with full certainty that I haven't even scratched the surface. I can also tell you that before this game is done, I'm going to give this game at least 150 hours of my life and I'm fine with that.Red Dead Redemption 2 is a prequel, but if you were expecting John Marston to take the reigns of Red Dead 2, you're going to be disappointed. Instead, you'll be playing as Arthur Morgan. Similar to Marston, Morgan is an orphan who was basically raised by gang leaders Dutch van der Linde and Hosea since he was 13, learning to shoot, ride and of course, commit crimes.As an adult, Morgan is gruff, but fair and is in high regard with many members of the gang. Never afraid to get his hands dirty, Morgan has no problem robbing banks, collecting debt and any other misdeeds necessary for the gang to survive. However, after a failed robbery in Blackwater, he starts to question Dutch's judgment, but does his best to stay in line. It's a decision that's going to cost him dearly.Although he has a brusque demeanor most of the time, Morgan isn't without depth. You'll find most of it when you read through his journal. Along with his excellent sketchings, the man records his inner thoughts on the occurances of the day –– good, bad or ugly. One of my favorite entry discusses how he hates loan sharking even though it's technically legal work, reflecting on the harshness of existence. It's in those moments where you see Arthur the man.Outside of his journal, Morgan is struggling to find his place in a rapidly changing world, one where organized civilization and growing capitalist interests are infringing on his hopes of living free of government restraint. Those are some big heady subjects to grapple with for sure, but on a micro level, Arthur is dealing with shifting priorities and loyalties within his gang. A resentment and disillusionment is growing between Dutch and Morgan, that with their surrogate father/son relationship is at once cliched and real.Fans of the original Red Dead Redemption will be excited to learn that the prequel, set in 1899, focuses on Dutch van der Linde and his gang in somewhat happier times. Everyone's on the run after the Blackwater incident. With the money now hidden near the scene of the crime, the game is hard up for cash and holed up in an abandoned mining camp on Horseshoe Overlook outside of the small livestock town Valentine.It's from this rather desperate situation where we get to see the Van der Linde gangs during happier times -- you know, before John Marston was hunting down his old mates to earn clemency from past crimes. Dutch, styling himself like a wild west Robin Hood, is all speeches, charisma and big ideas centering on finding a piece of land in a rapidly developing civilized west where his people can live wild and free of the United States government.We find out that before Bill Williamson and Dutch abandoned John Marston, inadvertently setting off the events of Red Dead 1, Bill was immensely loyal to Dutch and his way of life. Sure, he's an aggressively violent killer, but a principled, aggressively violent killer. Javier Escuella also makes an appearance as one of Dutch's acolytes. Faithful and loyal almost to a fault, he all-in on Dutch's philosophies and considers his fellow gang members as brothers.And speaking of John Marston, that guy seems to constantly be on the short end of the stick. Our first encounter with John is a rescue mission. Badly wounded from the heist shootout, he's attacked by wolves leaving those permanent scars we've come to know and love.He's sarcastic as hell, and a bit of a jerk, but over time proves to be quite an honorable guy –– I mean as honorable as an outlaw can be. Abigail and Marston's son Jack are also in the gang and it's clear that Abigail and John are at odds for his lackluster parental skills. A member of the gang, she's not afraid to stand for herself or her son.Interacting with all these characters from the first game is bittersweet. Sure, it's fun to see them before everything went to hell in a handbasket, especially Dutch and John. But I couldn't help but shake the feeling that I was watching a slow motion wreck. Playing the first game lets you know that sooner or later, things fall apart for the Van der Linde gang. From the minute you start playing, you're in a subconscious wince, waiting for the other shoe to drop.At times, I feel like I'm living in a movie or maybe season one of Westworld. From the moment, the title sequence began and I started moving protagonist Arthur Morgan through a raging snowstorm, I felt like I was sitting through a variation of an opening scene of The Hateful Eight. The snow came down in wet, sticky clumps, making it difficult to see anything that wasn't directly in front of you.As I went with Dutch and Micah on a supply-finding mission, I marveled at how realistically the newly-fallen snow moved in relation to the horses hooves. Even more impressive was how individual particles in the top layer of frozen precipitation glistened as we moved.Thanks to a new dialogue system, I had the opportunity to pose questions to both my companions about the current state of affairs, which helped flesh out their personalities in delightful ways. And when it came down to saving Dutch by gunning down a few members of our hated rival gang, the slow motion effect when I made my first shot made me feel like I was in an action movie.But if you really want to invoke that movie-feeling, you'll want to activate Cinematic Mode. Typically comprised of aerial or side shots, Cinematic Mode adds the traditional thick letterboxes around the picture for that real western feel. As cool as that is, I found that I couldn't use the effect often as it made it difficult to reliably control my horse. There were far too many times that I ran my poor steed into a tree or over a rock causing injury to both of us. But maybe you'll have better control than me.Another way the game is like the movie –– pacing. Red Dead 2 is a slow burn, complete with long horse rides and measured dialogue. Not a scene is wasted and even the side missions do some light character-building work in a lot of cases. That means, you'll definitely be robbing banks and trains, but it's going to be a long, winding road to get to that point.The detail found in that snow-locked vista is the rule rather than the exception as evidenced by the many articles dedicated to the care Rockstar took to reproduce horse testicles. In fact, I got ""treated"" to a front row seat of my horse taking a big ole' dump as I dismounted. But visceral voiding acts aside, the game is breathtakingly beautiful and diverse.Riding through a mountainous desert was a bounty of beige and brown dotted with sparse vegetation and hardy fauna. The plains were a sprawling expanse of light green grass of various heights, where it wasn't uncommon to flush out a pheasant or jackrabbit. But my favorite territory by far is the swampland, which I discovered when I was running from the law.One minute I was ducking and dodging across a grass meadow, the next I'm sinking into the muck and mire of the swamp. As I waded into the brackish terrain, I saw a water moccasin slither by, leaving gentle ripples in its wake, bisecting the reflection of the moon. It was beautiful, but I couldn't stop to really drink it in as the bounty hunters were determined to get their $30 bounty. So I pressed on and almost got devoured by a particularly large alligator that I thought I'd mistaken for a log.My point is, there's no such thing as ugly in the world of Red Dead Redemption 2 and you owe it to yourself to take in the sights.    Did you feed your cowboy today? There's a fair amount of character management in Red Dead 2. In addition to having the ability to changing Morgan's aesthetic appearance, you can also affect his overall well-being with his food intake. Eat a bit too much and Arthur becomes overweight which raises his health but decreases his stamina. If he's underfed, you'll gain more stamina at the expense of your health. You're also going to have to keep a close watch on your horse's stamina and health as well as work on building a bond with it.And if that's not enough micro-management for you, you can also cultivate your camp. By donating cash, food and animal pelts when you get back to camp, you can raise moral which can help with resource management. You can also customize the camp layout which opens access to medicines, tonics, food and munitions in camp.While I'd advise against tricking out the more cosmetic changes in camp, it's absolutely vital that you max out Dutch's tent as soon as possible. Maxing out his tent brings in more money for the camp and allows you to improve your own tent, which will unlock Fast Travel ability. It's an important feature considering that horses are your main mode of transportation, which means getting from point A to point B can take a really long time.While there's a fair amount of shooting and death in Red Dead 2, it's not as gratuitous as it is in Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto game. This game is more concerned with character building and telling a legitimate story than letting you accrue a massive body count. You can, of course, just start shooting stuff up, but life will get awfully difficult once those bounties on your head get larger. And besides, you're going to shoot plenty of folk along the way, it's just more thoughtful this time -- or maybe I'm just getting old and sentimental (I'm going with the former option, FYI).When you do decide to trade iron, you have a vast arsenal of weapons to choose from as the game goes on including various models of pistols, revolvers, rifles and shotguns. And lets not forget the bow and arrows, tomahawk, throwing knifes, and incendiary devices. Something that was new to me was not having my full arsenal at my disposal at any given time.That meant that before I went busting up enemy gang camps, I had to go to my horse and create a specific loadout. It's an interesting mechanic that matches the methodical, semi-realistic nature of the game. But I'm not going to lie, there were quite a few times I forgot about this mechanic and charged into battle with nothing but a knife, a revolver and a lasso. It did not end well.But my one and only complaint about Red Dead 2 has to do with the controls. The controls have some serious lag, especially when it came time to start ventilating foes. The tiny aiming reticle was bad, but moving it into position was tortuous, taking about 2-3 seconds to get the enemies into my sights. And by the time I got a bead on someone, they had moved and I was targeting a less vital body part. This can be a major problem for folks obsessed with nailing headshots, so you might want to try and fiddle with the aiming controls.Another control-relating issue comes when you enter towns. I can't tell you how many times I went to extend a friendly greeting to a non-playable character and inadvertently robbing them. When you get into a town, I would think that the default option should be unarmed, but apparently Rockstar thinks otherwise. For a game that's so incredibly polished, it's disappointing that controls are so sluggish and shoddy.Honestly, I could write for days about Red Dead Redemption 2. From its stunning vistas, compelling characters and attention to detail, the game is without a question Rockstar's best (you can @ me about it).Some might take issue with the pacing, but when the immersion factor kicks in (and it will kick in) you'll quickly adapt to the world that Rockstar has created. And believe me, this is a world, not a sandbox -- every part of the game bears witness to Rockstar's dedication to being comprehensive with even something as mundane as a horse taking a hot, steamy crap transforming into interactive art.But for all those hours of crunch time and the thousands of pages of scripts, any good western, be it a movie or a game is nothing without its satisfying shootouts. Rockstar manages to deliver, but the ultimate gratification can be delayed thanks to the sluggish controls. But no matter how you slice it, Red Dead Redemption 2 is something every gamer should experience.Sherri L. Smith has been cranking out product reviews for Laptopmag.com since 2011.

Please try again It’s also undeniably a shooter — from your choice of a first- or third-person perspective — complete with an array of pistols, revolvers, shotguns, and rifles; a “dead-eye” slow-motion effect that helps ensure you’re the most lethal gunslinger in the west; and even quick-draw duels.Another label I’d not hesitate to apply is “simulation,” as it strives for — and brilliantly achieves — a period perfect atmosphere that goes far beyond its loving depiction of homesteads and horses to include minute details, such as era-specific tradespeople going about their busy lives, time spent performing camp chores such as hauling hay bales and fetching water, and hotel baths in which it takes a minute or more of player interactions to scrub off a week’s buildup of cowboy grime.But if I had to settle on just one descriptor, it would be interactive story. During its marathon production — which lasted some seven years — Rockstar produced 300,000 unique animations, recorded half a million lines of dialogue, and employed a shocking 1,200 voice and motion capture actors. The result is an emotional, immersive and sympathetic tale of American outlaw life in 1899, the very final days of the Wild West.The tale follows Arthur Morgan, one of the main members of a nomadic gang — the same one to which John Marsten, protagonist of the original Red Dead Redemption, once belonged — that is caught between growing civilization in the west and the established society of the east. He’s a hard and uneducated man of action with a gravelly mumble voice reminiscent of Jeff Bridges’ in True Grit, but he’s also surprisingly pensive. He knows his way of life is fast coming to an end, and he’s troubled by his bloody deeds, often confiding his guilt to the women of the gang’s camp, who worry about Arthur but refuse to absolve him of his sins.His primary rationale for all he’s done is his mentor of the last 20 years, Dutch van der Linde, a gentleman bandit whose Robin Hood-esque philosophizing helped attract a band of loyal and strangely kind-hearted thugs who somehow manage to justify their often wicked ways by thieving from those who can afford it and helping those who can’t help themselves. But times have been tough, and Dutch has become desperate, forced to recruit less honourable henchmen, work with shadier associates, and take on riskier jobs for reasons less noble than he’d like.This ragtag group of men and women is Arthur’s family, and after spending scores of hours with them — I feel like I binge-watched half a dozen seasons of Deadwood over the last week — I almost came to think of them as my family as well. There are siblings both wild and reliable, aunts and uncles set in their ways, and a grandfather figure who provides a level-headed contrast to some of Dutch’s riskier undertakings. You’ll love some and hate others, but when things go sideways — as they almost inevitably do — they’re all in it together and have each others’ backs.It’s Arthur, however, who proves the most interesting. The game is a fascinating study of a conflicted man who knows right from wrong, but doesn’t always allow this knowledge to inform his decisions. His common sense and decency manifests in all sorts of ways, from his steadfast refusal to buy into the racism of the time to his support of women, both in roles traditionally reserved for men and in their quest for the right to vote. And yet he’ll kill — albeit often with hesitation and regret — almost anyone who gets in his way during a job. As the game progresses this duality grows and at points almost tears him apart. He’s a classic antihero: A bad man seemingly headed for tragedy who we nonetheless like, root for, and want to see make better choices.But it’s not all dark. A healthy dose of Rockstar’s signature adult humour is injected into the proceedings, often by way of side stories. Quests involving colourful characters — like an inventor working on a means of execution more humane than the noose, or a writer chronicling the exploits of an aging duellist — provide plenty of comic relief, sometimes with a bit of over-the-top gore or a hint of cultural commentary easy to connect to current events. From start to finish, whether intended to make us laugh, ponder, or cry, the writing never falters.The upshot of all of this storytelling is that, unlike the vast majority of open world games, there is extraordinarily little repetition. Every mission and virtually every chance encounter is scripted and purposeful, designed to develop characters, progress the story, or better familiarize us with the game’s sophisticated controls and systems. I never felt like I was doing the same thing twice. There’s no grinding, no endlessly repeated tasks included simply to lengthen the experience. Even tasks that occasionally do repeat — helping a man thrown from a horse on the road, or a woman attacked by marauders — are accompanied by original dialogue that gives them each a flavour and distinct memory of their own. Thought and reason has been put into everything we do, and it helps the hours fly by. There’s neither a chance nor a reason to grow bored.Supporting and enhancing everything is astounding attention to detail, which can be both a blessing and a curse — though far more often the former.This is a game that knows it has interesting things to show us, and it won’t take no for an answer. Some weapons need to be cocked or have rounds chambered between shots, and all of them have to be regularly polished with gun oil — actions that the player must both perform and watch play out. Hunted game needs to be retrieved, skinned (a disgusting but oddly satisfying animation), and properly stowed on your horse rather than simply scooped up while walking past. Fast travel is available, but not readily, forcing us to spend long minutes simply galloping along (though an optional cinematic camera angle can make these journeys through gorgeously rendered landscapes beautiful to just sit back and watch). Store catalogues are so thorough that they’re essentially replica books from the era, which can turn a quick trip into a shop to pick up some canned beans or horse tonic into a 15-minute odyssey as you get lost reading mesmerizing ads and product descriptions.Not surprisingly, these meticulous interactions demand an equally complex control scheme, meaning that various buttons on the gamepad are used in different ways, depending on context. And there have been many times when I meant to do one thing but accidentally did another — potentially robbing or shooting some innocent — because I’d forgotten the function of a button had changed according to the circumstances. Thankfully, controls are typically shown in the bottom right corner of the display, and as I became more careful and accustomed to how everything worked my mistakes grew more infrequent.And in the end, these are minor complaints of excess — the sort of problem most games would welcome. They hardly take away from the overall experience, which delivers one of the most ambitious and finely directed stories ever told in the medium of games, one populated with a huge cast of memorable characters and filled with compelling ruminations on eternal human questions to do with family, loyalty, morality and mortality.Red Dead Redemption 2 is the must-play of the year, and elegant proof that grand-scale single-player games are far from obsolete.

Red Dead Redemption 2,Ron Burke,GamingTrend,http://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/where-the-leather-is-scarred-there-is-a-great-story-to-tell-red-dead-redemption-2-review/,"There is nothing more synonymous with America than the cowboy. The cowboy was the foundation of our country, living hard and dirty off the land. The iconic rough rider, astride his trusty paint, helped build the first towns, and panned for gold, all with a six shooter on his hip. Sometimes, he and his six shooter lawlessly robbed those who seemed to have a little more than they did. It was a tough, sometimes violently shortened life full of uncertainty where Pinkerton Detectives, bounty hunters, and fellow rough riders could end your life just as easily as exposure, starvation, or rattlesnakes. Red Dead Redemption 2 aims to bring this world to life in a way that transcends the mythology of the American cowboy, pushes the envelope on what it means to be an sandbox title, and showcases exactly how Rockstar intends to break all the rules in their latest game.As always, I’ll do my best to try to avoid spoilers as much as possible in this review. That said, there will be some necessary to set up the structure — but I’ll do my best to keep em light, partner.Red Dead Redemption 2 takes place in 1899, making it a prequel to the first game, which occurs in 1911. A robbery goes south in the town of Blackwater, leaving protagonists Arthur Morgan, John Marston, Dutch Van der Linde, familiar faces Bill Williamson and Javier Escuella, and the rest of the Van der Linde gang fleeing deep into the mountains. Beset by wolves, hunger, and bitter cold, they eventually descend down to the fictional wild frontier that Rockstar has created to scratch out a living. While Dutch is pretty clear that they should keep their head down, with so many mouths to feed, it doesn’t take long before the gang is donning masks; up to their old tricks again. Everyone would be happy to enjoy peace for a spell, but they’ve got a powerful need to eat.The year 1899 is not a coincidental choice for Red Dead Redemption 2. At this point in American history, settlers had completed their sojourn west for the most part, towns were beginning to crop up, and state lines were beginning to get carved in stone, though much of the southwest was still up for grabs. It’s also the time of Butch Cassidy and the Wild Bunch, Tom Horn, Pat Garrett, Harvey “Kid Curry” Logan, Bill Doolin, the Sundance Kid, and many more well known outlaws. Of course, the term “outlaw” is written from the perspective of the law — through Rockstar’s lens, we might just know these folk as folk, and that’s precisely what makes Red Dead Redemption 2 so amazing.Mechanically, the Rockstar team has given us new ways to interact with the world around us with a conversation engine. As anyone who walks, rides, or rolls past you, pressing a shoulder button lets you focus on that person, giving you an option to greet or antagonize them. If you bump into them and they get upset, instead of greet you’ll get “Defuse” where you can attempt to talk down the person you just offended before things get violent. Similarly, if you antagonize somebody, you can shake them down for their money and valuables. It’s also the same system that lets you calm down your horse if it gets too close to a predator, as an example. You can even calm or scold a dog, though I have no idea why you’d do the latter. Pulling out your pistol and leaving it at your side while having a conversation with someone changes the tone of that conversation, as you might imagine, even if you don’t point it at them. Realizing that it’s a very long ride to the next town, you might want to be mindful of brandishing iron around your local watering hole.This new conversation system ties heavily into Rockstar’s fresh take on honor. Arthur is going to have to make some choices, and he won’t always find himself on the right side of the law. Occasionally, people are going to have to die, and sometimes the camp’s need for money necessitates getting his hands dirty. Despite his previous actions, Arthur’s honor meter starts dead center, and your decisions move it to the positive or negative. While robbing someone with a mask on might let you get away from the law, it’s still a black mark on your honor. If you help people out, even (or especially) when they don’t deserve it, that’ll push you a notch towards the positive. Having a good reputation with the local town can yield discounts from friendly shopkeepers, whereas having a poor reputation may make people afraid of you, removing any discounts that “heros” receive. I don’t want to ruin any surprises, but it also has a direct impact on story elements, encouraging you to pick a path and stick with it instead of riding the center.To say that the world of Red Dead Redemption 2 has a tremendous amount of things to busy yourself with would be a horrible understatement, but it’d also be a bit of a mischaracterization. Most games have activities to break up the story, or otherwise used as padding to round out the title. Here, they are more a natural extension of the world. Rattling them off seems somewhat superfluous as they are precisely the things you’d expect in a feature-rich world, but I’d be remiss in my job if I didn’t. Naturally, there’s holding up businesses and robbing their proprietors (though now you can even chase down their side hustles for additional income), robbing trains and waylaying their passengers, robbing banks and cracking their safes (or for a louder option, dynamite), and leaping onto carriages and fencing them (once you can find someone who will accept your illicit goods). You can now also catch wild horses and sell them, take pictures, play Poker, Dominoes, BlackJack, Five Finger Fillet, do a bit of fishing, hunt wildlife for pelts and meat, wrangle livestock for auction, rob homesteads, mug passersby at gunpoint, and bring in bounties for the local constabulary. Better still is that these feel like organic choices as a consequence of a living world instead of necessary distractions to “keep the player busy”.The mechanics in Red Dead Redemption 2 have received a complete overhaul from its predecessor. Arthur’s primary stats are split between health, stamina, and dead eye, the latter of which serves as a sort of slow motion that will allow you to sight in specific targets that will unleash once you suspend dead eye, or the meter runs out. Like a good RPG, the more you use these skills, the more they level up and expand. What’s different here is that the system is now based on a blend of your core and the attached meter. While your meter will replenish over time, should you ease up on incoming damage, stop running, or stop engaging dead eye, the core will not. It represents that bone-tired feeling you get once you go well past your breaking point. Once you’ve done this, the only way to replenish your cores is with rest, or with consumables. It is a great way to get people to use the consumables, and it makes stat growth feel meaningful.On a related note, there’s also the matter of you stinking like a two-dollar whore. The more you ride through the dirt, get knocked into the mud, slog through the Louisiana swamps, and otherwise get raked through the muck, the more what I’m affectionately calling the “filth meter” runs out. It represents your cleanliness, which affects how others treat you, how nasty you look in these amazing cutscenes, and how fast your stamina depletes. I guess that nasty crust you’ve developed slows you down a bit. Beyond needing the occasional bath, you can also shave, cut your hair and apply a generous schelacking with some Pomade, and otherwise decide how “frontiersman authentic” you’d like to look. Your horse needs similar attention, needing the occasional run through the stream to get clean, and a brush every now and again, lest their nasty crustiness slow them down as well.Speaking of horses, they are far more than simple conveyance in Red Dead Redemption 2. In games like Grand Theft Auto, cars were fun to trick out, but you never really felt a lot of anguish if they took a dent. Here in Red Dead Redemption 2, the first time a rival gang member shot my horse I was downright angry, immediately gunning them down in rapid fashion, going so far as to pick up their bodies and dumping each into the nearby swamp for the gators to eat. There are nineteen types of horses, each with different speed and acceleration stats, but once you let me name an animal, and then spend time bonding with it (bonding unlocks the ability to rear up, drift, or prance sideways), all bets are off. Sure, you get extra stamina, health, and you can summon him from a longer range at higher bonding levels, but I’m gonna unlock a bucket of buckshot into the first sum’bitch that shoots at Buttercup!Looking the part has always been a staple in Rockstar’s games, and Red Dead Redemption 2 is no exception. When you’ve gotten enough cash in your pockets to the extent where you can afford to be a bit more frivolous with it, you can visit your favorite General Store and pick out some threads. The difference between this and other Rockstar titles is that they now serve more than a cosmetic purpose. The world of Red Dead Redemption 2 is absolutely massive, and that means multiple climates. Traveling up north will cause Arthur to become cold, and conversely heading down south will require lighter clothes lest he overheat. Your horse can hold three outfits without having to return to camp, leaving you more freedom to stay out on the range for longer periods of time.Clothing is split between hats, jackets, vests, pants, boots, shirts, and accessories. You can mix and match your outfit to your heart’s content, but should you collect a full outfit set, these can convey additional bonuses. For example, the Horseman outfit set provides a health bonus, whereas the Explorer outfit set will provide a bonus to deadeye. These require rare crafting materials, making them a challenge with their own reward.Much of your crafting resources come from hunting, and that aspect of the game has received a massive overhaul from the first title. You can certainly stand off at a distance with a scoped rifle and tear a hole through a whitetail doe, but there’s as likely a chance you’ll tear up the pelt, ruining it. The best way to collect the necessary pelts is to crouch down, use the new Eagle Eye mechanic to visually see the smells of your prey (and your own, for that matter), and hone in on their tracks. With a bow and arrow, you’ll follow their scent and tracks, slowly moving in until you have a clean shot at your prey. A clean shot is necessary, too, because the first time you hit a doe in the shoulder instead of the neck only to have it run off and then fall over, wailing in pain as it slowly dies, you’ll make sure that every shot matters from then on. Collecting perfect pelts may also require a specific weapon using a singular type of ammunition (e.g. a varmint gun for squirrels), so one size weapon does not always fit all.If you do enough hunting, you’ll eventually stumble across Legendary animals. Taking them down (and that’s quite a challenge) will give you pelts and parts that you can craft into talismans and trinkets that provide additional stats. One example is the Beaver Tooth Trinket which provides a permanent slowing of weapon degradation, and another being the Elk Antler Trinket which offers an extra 10% to money you loot from the dead. Rest assured, the game doesn’t turn into a stat juggling RPG — these various charms are extremely rare, keeping the game firmly rooted in reality.Larger and more dangerous prey (and certainly the Legendary animals) will require bait to lure. Bait can be purchased or crafted, and when combined with certain scents or scent suppressants, are the key to the more difficult hunts. Similarly, fishing has a whole tackle box full of lures and bait to consider when pulling in that big Chain Pickerel or Rock Bass.To help you tackle the wild, wild west, you’ll be able to spend your hard earned (or ill gotten) gains on upgrades for your camp. These can be as simple as better food options, or additional medicines for the group, or something more comprehensive as better tents, chicken coops, or maybe a nice boat to pull in a tasty, flaky fish. The rest of the camp won’t pull their weight, as you’ll see in the ledger, or when you are doing other camp chores, but that’s the way it goes.My only real complaint with Red Dead Redemption 2 is the Wanted system — a familiar foe in Rockstar games. Most of the time, it works precisely as intended, and you can talk down folks from escalated encounters, but occasionally it’ll shift into overdrive and go full on Grand Theft Auto on you. Case and point, I nudged a passerby with my horse, he swore at me, screamed, and I found myself with a $40 fine and several lawmen in tow. I’ve also bumped into somebody while entering a store causing the storekeeper to flee in terror. It’s a nuisance compounded by the fact that your bounty does not wear off — if you have a $300 price on your head, it’s gonna stay there till you are dead, or you pay it off.Truthfully, I could wax poetically about Red Dead Redemption 2 for many more paragraphs. The incredible graphical presentation, Woody Jackson’s phenomenal musical score, over half a million lines delivered by over 1000 voice actors, open world events that feel like main story elements, the cinematic camera (which makes even a basic ride feel like a cutscene), treasure maps with the promise of discovery, the amazing juxtaposition of the electric lights in Saint Denis versus sleepy towns like Valentine, and much, much more are all worthy of praise. All of these elements just further illustrate just how complete and whole Rockstar’s newest world really is.You’ll notice that this review hasn’t covered anything about multiplayer, and that’s on purpose. Red Dead Redemption 2 is an entirely self-contained single player experience with no equivocations or compromises. We’ll get our first glimpse at what that online experience looks like in November, but you’d be perfectly justified in buying this title to enjoy the 60+ hour world even if you never stepped online.Red Dead Redemption 2 raises the bar for sandbox adventure games. It’s organic in a way almost unseen in any genre, creating an authentic open world that is as cohesive as it is compelling.

Red Dead Redemption 2,Keza MacDonald,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/oct/25/red-dead-redemption-2-review-western-playstation-xbox-rockstar,"PlayStation 4, Xbox One; Rockstar GamesTotal immersion in an astonishingly lifelike world – whether you’re outgunning rivals or skinning animals – makes this outlaw adventure a landmark gameAnybody coming to Red Dead Redemption 2 expecting Grand Theft Auto with horses will be rather baffled by this slow-paced, sumptuous, character-driven Old West historical drama, in which you spend probably 60% of your time simply riding around the American wilderness. There’s action too, in the form of shootouts, train robberies and frequent thrilling escapes on horseback, but these flashes of excitement punctuate a game that is largely about just being somewhere; about hunting, fishing and having long conversations on cross-country rides or around a campfire. In a mad fit of indulgence, Rockstar Games – the creators of Grand Theft Auto and one of the most successful game developers in the world – appears to have spent seven years and hundreds of millions creating the video game equivalent of Deadwood.This is a story – a collection of stories, really – about the decline of a way of life, as a small gang of outlaws tries ever harder to outrun the inexorable advance of American modernity, as well as the enemies and lawmen they have antagonised along the way. The player’s character, Arthur Morgan, is one of a small central cast assembled around gang leader Dutch Van der Linde, a classic western outlaw who fancies himself as a freedom fighter rather than a base criminal. The game takes in encounters with con men, warring Southern estates, rival gangs and a vivid array of incidental characters shaping turn-of-the-century America, touching upon race and women’s suffrage, but keeping the overarching narrative focused on the Van der Linde band and the relationships within it.These characters are rendered believable by technology that makes them look and move like real people, actors giving excellent performances with unexpected range, and writing that probes at their weaknesses and preoccupations. As you ride with them on robberies, hustles and other misadventures, they share anecdotes and personal observations that build over hours into rich portraits. Life centres around the camp, to which the player returns between robberies, hunting expeditions and encounters with the law to eat, sleep, take stock and share moments with the other members of the gang.Were it not so astonishing to look at, the amount of time that Red Dead Redemption 2 expects you to spend enjoying the scenery might be intolerably boring. But the Old West that Rockstar has conjured here is close to miraculous. Its world is a collage of capsule versions of real American landscapes: the crisp cold of the mountains; mesa-studded plains that offer views for miles; foggy, humid mornings in the bayou in the fictional Southern state of Lemoyne. In towns – or in the grimy, captivating city of Saint Denis, a fast-modernising take on turn-of-the-century New Orleans that is truly a marvel – you can call out a greeting to anyone walking the streets and be met with aggressive wariness or a polite nod. The horses are almost unnervingly lifelike, stately creatures that grunt and sweat as you gallop, whinnying nervously when you hear wolves in the night.The obsessive detail on show here (and the determination to immerse the player in it) recalls Cormac McCarthy’s border trilogy, those long, sparsely punctuated passages where he would spend pages describing a landscape and you’d realise, at the end, that you hadn’t exhaled for minutes. Rockstar plucks from all sorts of cinematic and literary sources for this version of the Old West, but its depiction is original, less romanticised and moralistic than the western movies that provide blueprints for the robberies and horseback shootouts of its action scenes. A movie cannot afford to spend tens of hours setting the scene in the way that Red Dead Redemption 2 does when it sends you on long horseback journeys, often without company. It has you skinning animals, cleaning guns, taking baths. The aggregate effect of all this detail is nothing less than total immersion, the sensation of a lived experience.This world is not only relentlessly beautiful, but has such a lot going on that you often find yourself on unexpected adventures. This isn’t the usual video game busywork of endless collecting and killing. On the way to hunt a prize ram, I happened upon a train robbery in progress, decided to intervene, and ended up driving the train to the next station, where I entered a saloon and got into a fight over a poker game. When the lawmen came knocking I was pursued for miles, ending up in a part of the world I’d never seen before, where I set up camp by the railroad and cooked up some boar meat. The next morning I happened upon a small gang of criminal miscreants sat around a fire, which turned out to be at the mouth of a huge cave complex serving as a hideout for a whole criminal gang. I barely survived the ensuing shootout, then had to make a run for it before I could loot the spoils, because bounty hunters from the previous town had suddenly shown up looking for me. This was maybe two hours of game time, and Red Dead offers 100 or more. It is impossibly vast.There can be no doubt that this is a landmark game. It is a new high water-mark for lifelike video game worlds, certainly, but that world is also home to a narrative portrait of the wild west that is unexpectedly sombre and not afraid to take its time. With very few exceptions, the many stories that Rockstar’s writers have set out to tell about this group of outlaws land perfectly, the enjoyable twists and turns of individual missions and chapters feeding into an exciting, sophisticated and absorbing larger narrative – and the stories that you discover yourself within its world are no less compelling. Around 2,000 people worked very hard (probably too hard, in some cases) to make this game possible. Every last one of them should be proud of their contribution.Red Dead Redemption 2 is out Friday 26 October; £49.99."
Red Dead Redemption 2,Asher Madan,Windows Central,http://www.windowscentral.com/red-dead-redemption-2-xbox-one-review,"No offers foundWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.Red Dead Redemption 2 is a cinematic action-adventure game set in the Wild West. The title takes place in 1899, a time which brought stability to the United States, but also resulted in a drastic shift for many individuals who lived close to the untamed frontier. Beforehand, the federal government chose not to heavily intervene in these territories, going all the way to California. However, the need for consolidation and some form of control — especially when states like Montana and Utah were admitted into the Union — triggered an end to the uncontrolled lawlessness that prevailed during those times. What many people considered ""true freedom"" was coming to an end.These are the times depicted in Red Dead Redemption 2, which, by the way, is frankly sensational.Simply the bestThe golden standard for open world games.Every inch of this game has been carefully crafted to deliver the highest possible quality experience, and it shows all throughout this generation-defining experience.Government agents were dispatched to round up existing gangs and even hunt down notorious criminals. Private companies recruited sizable militias which prevented trains and stagecoaches from being robbed. Instead of thriving, life on the road became all about survival on a day-to-day basis. Gangs had to hide and rely on numerous smaller jobs which hopefully flew under the radar of local law enforcement. You couldn't amass millions. Gangs were always living on the edge.Gangs had to hide and rely on numerous smaller jobs.Instead of glorifying the Wild West, Red Dead Redemption 2 presents the struggle of one of the last gangs in the United States. The game weaves a believable tale which focuses on the heists and behind-the-scenes challenges of life in the wild west, on the fringes of the law. The main cast of almost two dozen characters presents their own unique takes on the hardships they face. For example, the needs of John Marston's wife and son may be vastly different than those of the loan shark Leopold Strauss. However, fate has brought everyone together. Rockstar ties the Red Dead Redemption 2's narrative together with a confidence rarely seen in the medium.Arthur Morgan, the protagonist of Red Dead Redemption 2, is one such outlaw who questions his actions. He is a product of the times and is governed by basic principles like family and loyalty. Morgan may be rough around the edges but is committed to the gang members who raised him. Despite the fact that he seems weary of life on the run, he stands by Dutch van der Linde, the leader of the gang, returning alongside John Marston from the original Red Dead Redemption.Uprooting themselves again and again, and barely scraping by, begins to test their patience. How Morgan handles these trying times forms the crux of the story. Red Dead Redemption 2 focuses on themes like liberty, and unchecked power.Arthur Morgan is governed by basic principles like family and loyalty.Unlike the original Red Dead Redemption, this game places an emphasis on day-to-day survival. In order to perform at his best, Morgan must sleep, eat, change attire, maintain weapons, and work with various other supporting systems, such as fishing and cooking. Aside from personal upkeep, our protagonist has to provide for other members of the gang. For example, every outlaw is required to contribute to a community pool which can be used to buy supplies like food or medicine, and upgrade facilities like the kitchen. The more you contribute, the more goodwill you earn.Just like the Mass Effect series, Red Dead Redemption 2 features a ""Renegade"" or ""Paragon""-like system. Here's it's called ""Honor."" Helping out individuals in distress will move your bar towards the right, murdering and pillaging will push it towards the other direction. This seems to impact the way other characters view you in the game. Being a nuisance will result in locals calling the sheriff even if you're minding your own business. According to Rockstar Games, Honor also affects music in certain situations, how the story unfolds, Morgan's dreams, and his journal entries. Morality systems in Red Dead Redemption 2 are far more pervasive than in other, similar titles.The original Red Dead Redemption also featured an Honor system, but it was rather basic. Helping individuals in distress was looked upon favorably, but robbing or aiding thieves would drag you down, often putting you at odds with the story the game wanted to portray. Morgan is a full-fledged outlaw, so you don't have to worry about playing the game without ever committing a crime. Mayhem and murder are part of the experience. How you help people — whichever side of the law they may be on — is what matters in Red Dead Redemption 2.Visually, Red Dead Redemption 2 is an absolute marvel. The title features photorealistic visuals running at native 4K resolution on the Xbox One X. The frame rate is locked at thirty frames per second, and almost always hits that target. However, it intermittently dips whenever you enter some buildings, presumably as it loads in NPCs and other interactive objects.Red Dead Redemption 2 pushes the boundaries of graphics and interactivity.The use of high-resolution textures makes objects and characters look phenomenal, which is particularly important due to the inclusion of up-close-and-personal first-person mode. Unlike some of the pre-release footage, Red Dead Redemption 2 doesn't suffer from any ""jaggy"" edges on Xbox One X. However, the game does seem to lower the resolution of certain effects like object shadows from time to time. This may be a result of selective dynamic scaling to preserve performance.Overall, Red Dead Redemption 2 is an extremely polished experience. Aside from the occasional stutter, the only other issue detected on Xbox One X was a pair of canned goods floating in the air during a cutscene. It's evident that Rockstar Games spent countless time fixing bugs because even after dozens of hours, they're hard to find. Additionally, if you ever get your wagon stuck behind a rock, you don't have to reload the game. Just hold down the right bumper and your wagon will reverse.The vast majority of the game almost resembles the sort of pre-rendered imagery you might sooner expect from a Hollywood digital effects team. For an open world title, that's quite a feat, because generally, only narrow, linear adventure games tend to achieve this level of photorealism. Red Dead Redemption 2 not only pushes the boundaries in terms of graphics but also interactivity in open world games.Red Dead Redemption 2's world feels alive. Instead of simply clipping through the brushwood, Morgan shows discomfort as he uses his arms to push back wayward shrubbery. Additionally, when you're exploring the world, you can interact with every character — greet them or rob them — and be on your way. Lastly, animals react realistically when they hear you, fleeing as you approach on horseback. The variety of animations and realism in each creature's expression makes it feel less procedural and scripted, and far more dynamic and immersive. Every creature, every bit of wind-brushed foliage behaves with purpose, which is rare for open world games.Many memorable quests involve discovering secrets off the beaten path.Red Dead Redemption 2 features a plethora of side activities like dominoes, poker, hunting, fishing, bounty hunting, treasure hunting, debt collection, paleontology, bank robberies, and much more. The plot is interwoven with these activities.Additionally, you will also be working on improving your own gang's facilities. Investing in the base camp is quite possibly the most important gameplay mechanic. Not only does it unlock features like fast travel, but it also lifts the morale of the entire gang. You can ""upgrade"" attributes like food, medicine, and ammunition quality. These upgrades aren't too expensive, and instead of paying off bounties towards the beginning, you should save up and unlock them all.The game wants to give you an understanding of what life was like in the Wild West and then escalates the desperation of the gang from there. As the law closes in, everyone wants to escape to a place where no one can find them. However, this leads to a dramatic confrontation which changes everyone's lives forever.Many memorable quests involve discovering secrets off the beaten path. For example, close to the town of Valentine, you can find a dismembered corpse hanging from a bridge, with strong hints that this was the work of a serial-killer psychopath rather than your typical gang runner. You'll be able to work through uncovering other crime scenes, investigating the surrounding areas, if you opt to track down the killer. The depth of these sorts of side objectives, which many players might not even find, is a testament to Rockstar's attention to detail.Aside from the visuals, the most significant leap Red Dead Redemption 2 offers is the animation quality. The game features a significantly slower pace than the original Red Dead Redemption, as shooting and exploring are more methodical. According to the developer, there are over 300,000 individual animations in the experience. The title is meant to be savored. Rushing through will cause you to miss copious secrets and surprisingly deep side objectives scattered throughout the American Heartland. As a result of this, traversing the world can be a wonderfully relaxing experience. However, be prepared for random world events — like rival gangs or bounty hunters coming after you — always be on your toes.Just like the relatively slow-paced gameplay, shooting requires precision in place of a volley of bullets. Instead of simply striking a foe's torso multiple times, you should try to land headshots. Auto-aim returns making it easy for players to align shots, but you'll benefit more greatly from precision. The auto-aim comes in handy when there are numerous enemies about, or if a shootout is taking place in a dimly-lit environment, however, finding cover and taking time to deliver a critical hit is essential in Red Dead Redemption 2. The ""Dead Eye"" system from the original game has been upgraded to assist here. After you've mastered the ability, you can see weak points on animals and humans. Targeting these body parts will result in more reliable kills, to prevent yourself from becoming overwhelmed.Shooting requires precision in place of a volley of bullets.Every aspect of Red Dead Redemption 2 can be customized. For example, you can choose the color of your horse's mane, the design of the saddle, and even the engraving on your weapons. The options are incredibly detailed and even allow you to select the plating of different parts. Shopkeepers give you access to these options, and the ability to purchase ammunition. However, if you're desperate, you can always craft bullets at camps. Weapons become unreliable after a while, so be sure to stock up on gun oil and clean the barrels whenever you get the chance.Changing clothes is another important mechanic is Red Dead Redemption 2. Not only is it used to evade the law, but it also offers protection from the elements. If you commit a crime, the sheriff and his deputies will investigate the area and look for someone matching your description. If you keep an additional set of clothes on your horse's saddle, you can quickly change into them and leave the area before anyone spots you.The game does a great job of emphasizing the ideological and socioeconomic divide.The climate varies depending on where you are in Red Dead Redemption 2. If you're close to the mountains, you'll have to wear a thick coat or else your health will suffer. In swampy regions, you should just go about in a shirt. Dynamic weather affects riding conditions. For example, certain steep areas become incredibly slippery when it rains, requiring you to find alternative routes.Environmental variety plays an important role in Red Dead Redemption 2. You'll get to traverse biomes all the way from grassy plains to urban areas.Red Dead Redemption 2's music is seamlessly integrated into its gameplay as well as its environments, too. The title offers scintillating tracks which alternate depending on the region and action taking place. For example, during gunfights, more bold and fast-paced scores play in the background, adding cinematic drama to the visual feast. The voice acting is stellar as well.The game is structured in such a way that you feel at home when you're exploring the open world, and entirely out of place when you're interacting with individuals in cities. Red Dead Redemption 2 does a great job of emphasizing the divide in ideology and socioeconomic status that plague the country. It also doesn't shy away from tackling issues like racism and corruption, featuring story situations that will leave a lasting impact.Red Dead Redemption 2 represents a generational leap for the gaming industry. It not only gives players meaningful quests that surpass even those found in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, but it also touches on social issues that plague America even to this day.One of the best games ever made. Period.It almost feels beyond the standard definition of a ""game,"" bordering on raw simulation. It's about life, and the array of events that just happen to occur within it, and the consequences therein.Despite some minor issues like stuttering in interiors, awkward camera angles in smaller houses, or the relatively slow start to the open world story campaign — Red Dead Redemption 2 simply overrides its small perceptible flaws with what is nothing short of a truly spectacular experience. Simply put, it is one of the best games ever made, setting a new standard for open world titles going forward.Simply the bestThe golden standard for open world games.Every inch of this game has been carefully crafted to deliver the highest possible quality experience, and it shows all throughout this generation-defining experience.Red Dead Redemption 2 should launch on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 on October 26, 2018. Pricing starts at $59.99.Keep an eye on WindowsCentral.com/Gaming for all the latest in Xbox and Windows 10 gaming, accessories, news, and reviews!This review was conducted on an Xbox One X, using a copy provided by the publisher.Asher Madan handles gaming news for Windows Central.

Red Dead Redemption 2,Tom Hoggins,Telegraph,http://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/reviews/red-dead-redemption-2-review-seismic-achievement/,"As Red Dead Redemption 2 is released on PC, with spectacular graphical overhauls and 60fps available to those with powerful gaming PCs, we present our original review of Rockstar's Western epicLast night I took a train. And don’t misunderstand me; I mean I took a train. I didn’t steal it, exactly, that’s not the kind of outlaw my Arthur Morgan is in Red Dead Redemption 2. I was on my way back to camp when I saw the dastardly LeMoyne raiders holding up the express. Passengers on the ground, guns waving around. I couldn’t let that pass. So I rode up and shot them down. Just doing my part in a lawless land. When I’m not plundering it myself, anyway.But, tragically, those LeMoyne swines had murdered the driver. So with the passengers fled and the train abandoned, what else was I to do? I hopped aboard, rang the bell and off I went, rolling through Red Dead Redemption 2’s extraordinary 19th century America. Past the small town of Rhodes, the kind of pop-up settlement with visions of grandeur you see scattered throughout this nascent land, through the soupy mists and swamps of the Bayou Nwa, the whistle screeching as I move through the city Saint Denis; a bustling, smoke-filled bastion of the encroaching civilisation our protagonist Arthur is trying to escape. Dear reader, how I loved sounding that whistle. Chooo-chooo.For over an hour I thundered through the world on that train. Every now and then I would stop off, hopping down from the train in billowing steam to intervene in a kidnapping, or visit the dilapidated den of thieves of the Van Horn trading post, scrapping with local outlaws in the mud. Me, in my Express of Justice, going wherever that winding track takes me.It is easy, then, to get distracted in Red Dead Redemption 2. And full disclosure here,  I haven't yet seen the credits roll  despite spending dozens of hours in its world. But 'completion' doesn't feel like the point here, not one bit, with the connections you make roaming the world --exploring it, pushing its systems-- feeling as integral, if not more so, than the game's story beats.I could have started with any number of anecdotes, but I went with the train because it is the freshest and most present in my mind. A lot of the time that is what playing Red Dead Redemption 2 is like: living in the moment; firing it up, mounting your horse and seeing where you end up. The Western world Rockstar has created is a vivid facilitator of this. It is --and there is no sufficient way of describing it without hyperbole-- unlike anything we have seen before.The pristine white mountains of the Grizzlies give way to the greenery of the Cumberland Forest, wildlife teeming through the thinning trees as you head out into the plains of the Heartlands, through green meadows and swampland, into Saint Denis; so busy and alien to the swathes of nature that surround it. The weather shifts dramatically, thunderstorms crackling across the plains, downpours giving way to sunshine, rainbows sprouting as awnings drip with the last of the rain.Rockstar is the master of open-world building, of course, with nothing coming close to Grand Theft Auto V’s urban sprawl until now. Red Dead Redemption 2 feels more of an artistic challenge. You will not find a better facsimile of Los Angeles than GTAV’s Los Santos, but in a sense that world is already defined by artifice. Creating something as natural as Red Dead Redemption 2 is a seismic achievement that, for all the rightful exploration of Rockstar’s apparently challenging work conditions, I hope the developers are deeply proud of.And to be clear, this isn’t just about how it looks. The interaction within is equally extraordinary.  Squeezing the left trigger with your gun holstered will allow you to interact with any other non-player character in the world, you can greet or antagonise them. Or straight up rob them on the spot. Interactions flow into each other and are placed within context; how Arthur is dressed, if he’s clean or there’s blood on his jacket, if he’s been scrapping in the local saloon (“no more trouble, y’hear”) or has just barged through a door in a sprint rather than walking in calmly.In shops you can browse individual items on shelves, Arthur dresses appropriately for the weather lest it affects his health and must be kept fed and rested. You can pat or feed your horse, clean it with a brush or by wading through clean water. You can hunt, tracking deer in the wilderness, the quality of the kill determined by your skill. Go fishing. Play poker. Meet strangers for target practice. Rob them if it doesn’t go your way, if you are so inclined.Each element seems to be afforded the same attention as the big ticket missions. Is this level of detail strictly necessary? Maybe not. But that doesn’t negate its effectiveness; Red Dead Redemption 2 is at pains to never take you out of its world. Even when it needs to do necessarily ‘gamey’ things, it will do so with smart smoke and mirrors or a line of dialogue. Leaving your trusted steed during a mission to mount a stagecoach and having it teleport back to camp? “He’ll find his way home,” says Arthur. Need to ‘reset’ a town a few real-world hours after you have shot the place up in a daring escape from the law? “We killed anybody that would recognise you.” Want to shake the law? Rather than them conveniently forgetting your crimes, you must pay off your own bounty in each state you’ve caused a ruckus.There is the balancing act a game that is aiming to be as ‘realistic’ as it can, while still providing the fun and streamlined thrills of a blockbuster video game. There is a wealth of systems at work, bedded into a world as seamlessly as possible. It is deft sleight of hand; a magic trick some of our Wild West companions would delight in.The upshot is a world that is tremendously easy to lose yourself in. But there is the backbone of a story to keep you moving, of course, and a very good one at that. Arthur is a prominent member of the Dutch van der Linde gang, a ragtag bunch of outlaws and misfits on the lam after a botched job in the town of Blackwater. After an introductory period encased in a snowstorm on the Grizzlies your caravan moves out East in the hope of staying out of trouble, taking up camp on Horseshoe Overlook in the Heartlands. The gang take on jobs in the surrounding area, legitimate and otherwise, but try not to overplay their hand. You can imagine how that turns out; moving on from each encampment with a trail of death and newfound enemies in their wake.Arthur is a quietly fascinating passenger in all of this. In some ways he is one of the least interesting members of the gang; grizzled, loyal to a fault and a man resigned to his fading place in history as the era of lawlessness in the West begins to die. He allows himself to be swept along in Dutch’s capers all too unquestioningly, an outlook he seems to have in life. “Folks that need shooting I try and shoot ‘em in the back,” he tells a travelling author in a run-down saloon. “Everything else is just bunk.”In other ways, this makes him the perfect video game protagonist; skilled and malleable, allowing you to mould Arthur as you prefer: thief of honour, ruthless brigand or somewhere in between. It also lets you see the death of the old west through the lens of one of its most dedicated proponents. The interesting thing about Arthur is that he knows he has no place in the onward march of progress, but doesn’t look to stand in its way. This is reflected in a tolerance often ill-matched by the world at large; Dutch and the majority of his gang holds little prejudice, making room for men and women of all colour and creed. There is plenty of bickering and glowering gruffness too, but it is in this motley crew that Red Dead Redemption 2 finds its character; the enigmatic but self-destructive Dutch. Sadie, the wild-eyed widow. The softly spoken Native Charles. Mrs Grimshaw, the camp's de facto boss, keeping everyone in check.It’s classy stuff, on the whole, acted with aplomb and far removed from the modern nihilism of Grand Theft Auto. This is a slower-burn and sadder story, though not without its moments of both levity and brutality, largely played out through Arthur’s interaction with its characters and the world. There are countless kooks to be met out there in saloons and fields; each with a challenge, request or simply there to add further texture to your trip.  If there is fault to be found, it’s that the cast is so plentiful that some of its best characters don’t always get as much screen time as you would like.While the entire world is open to you from almost the word go, the game’s main story missions tend to cluster around the gang’s shifting location. Similar to all Rockstar open-world games, the missions are activated by key characters marked in gold on the map. Often it is different members of the gang following a lead on some shady business or other; a train robbery or bank heist are never far away, while there are more subtle acts of crime and social subterfuge peppered throughout too. Many of the gang are more equipped to use their brains than their brawn.The missions are marked by Rockstar’s familiar inventiveness. Many are underpinned by panicked, brutal shooting; and this is probably Rockstar’s best work in the gunplay stakes. They feel like violent spaghetti western shootouts, as they well should. All splintered wood, flying bullets and blood. They can be over in a flash and are a thrill when they appear, but Red Dead Redemption 2 tries to avoid shootouts becoming too much of a crutch within missions, which look to mix up its objectives with some strands taking unexpected turns part-way through.It tends to keep you on your toes in an otherwise slow-burn game. But most missions look to tie into the world somehow and give you multiple options on approach. One early mission tasked me with robbing an oil wagon for a train heist. I could pinch one while it was out and about, or extract it direct from the local factory. Assaulting the area head-on in the day was basically suicide; guards patrolling everywhere, workers teeming, all ready to witness any naughtiness. So I set up camp nearby, waited until night, snuck over the fence into a quiet, darkened yard and rolled that wagon right on out of there.Many other missions are best described as team-bonding exercises; a day fishing with the old boys, singing maritime songs on the row home; a drunken night in the local saloon with Lenny; go off hunting with Charles to keep the camp’s food supplies high (you can contribute to the camp to keep morale up; it isn’t mandatory, but you will find yourself doing so anyway).Red Dead Redemption 2 is not afraid to shift gears, then. Or more accurately, is happy to switch between a gallop and a trot. This is perhaps where the game might find its divisiveness. This is a slow-burning tale, often at odds with the breakneck cycle of constant reward in a lot of modern video games. Its story is lengthy (that 60 hour estimation wasn't kidding) and its most explosive beats are sparingly used.By its very nature there are long stretches where it can feel the narrative isn’t moving on, as the gang settle and make their moves into the local area. This isn’t a criticism, but fair warning. Red Dead Redemption 2 is the kind of slow west yarn that lets you drink in its world, with plenty of time spent riding across its plains, but those looking for all-action, all-the-time should go in with their eyes open. But when it does kick into gear, the results are spectacular, its big moment delivered with the heft they deserve. As you move around the country and the gang’s predicament shifts, the complexion of both game and narrative can change to a startling degree. It is nothing if not carefully considered.That consideration makes it the perfect fit for a classic Western, then, but while it is well versed in the cinematic language of Ford and Leone, Red Dead Redemption is no longer a game in thrall to the movies. Instead this is a powerhouse of a video game, one of the finest, built by people at the top of their game and under intense pressure, lest we forget. As it is, they remind us of what games can be, creating a majestic sense of place and time and allowing you to play your role in the way only this medium allows. So, if you’ll excuse me, I have another train to, er, ‘catch’.Red Dead Redemption 2 is out now for PC, PS4 and Xbox One and will also release for Google Stadia on 19 November"

Spoiler warning: There are spoilers.“All those years!” Arthur Morgan screams in anguish, as he follows the titular head of Dutch’s gang down a long and winding road of betrayal, desolation, and despair. “All those years!”Arthur has, until now, been the pillar of strength and reliability in Dutch’s gang. He has followed orders, restored order, and even ordered supplies to keep the gang together through tragic events and dubious enterprises. He is now both at the end of his rope and his life as he battles illness and the growing sense that all his struggle might have been for nothing.It is in this moment that I realized Red Dead Redemption 2 isn’t a game, it’s a metaphor. It’s an exposition of the burden of being the perpetual outsider. Of being both relied upon and betrayed. Of building something great only to watch others with agendas and egos whittle it away. Of feeling helpless to steer one’s own course in spite of monumental success, and unparalleled freedom. Red Dead Redemption 2 isn’t about John Marston or Arthur Morgan. It isn’t about Dutch, or Micah, or even the entirety of Dutch’s gang. What it is about is its creator’s own struggle, and the part all of us have played.Red Dead Redemption 2 is quite possibly the last of its kind, if there ever was a game like it before: a AAA blockbuster video game employing hundreds of developers across multiple studios and taking years and millions of dollars to build. Nevertheless, every detail shows it is a product of the singular vision of its creator, and as a result it is one of the most narratively cohesive and creatively successful video games ever made.Red Dead Redemption 2 is actually two experiences, and Rockstar Studios and Take-Two Interactive have managed to create both in such a way that neither detracts from the other. Players who enjoy a sprawling narrative adventure can have just that. RDR2’s narrative is full of memorable characters and twists and turns to content even the most die-hard single player. On the other hand, players only there for the chaos and bloodshed inherent in a Rockstar game will also not be disappointed. From very early on in RDR2, it is possible to forgo most of the narrative and commence with the killing, the robbing, the racking up wanted levels, and all the traditional, loopy fun of a Rockstar game. That those two experiences exist not side-by-side, but intertwined, is one of the game’s greatest commercial strengths, and possibly its only notable flaw.RDR2 is easily a 100-hour game no matter how quickly you attempt to play through it. Its lavishly animated and excellently acted cutscenes may be skippable, but the crafty creator at Rockstar has embedded dozens of hours of dialogue and exposition into miserably unskippable riding and walking scenes. On the one hand, this is fantastic as it will allow you ample time to enjoy the game’s generous world full of transcendent scenery. Lush wilderness scenes transition flawlessly from one flavor of American West to another. Mountains, plains, swampland and hills are all lovingly and realistically portrayed, right down to the scurrying wildlife and scattering rocks. On the other hand, RDR2’s seemingly endless parade of exposition extends exposure to what is, even at its best moments, an entirely too long story that never strays from the ruts in the road well worn by a hundred years of Western cinema. And in a certain sense, none of the story even matters.You may, for example, ride into a town, kill literally every single one of its inhabitants, ride away from the posse of law-keepers who appear seemingly out of nowhere, make a desperate last attempt to survive in a stand of trees outside of town, murder every single badge and gun on your trail, loot their corpses, rinse the blood off yourself in a nearby stream, and then belly up to the post office in the next town over to pay down your bounty so you can ride back into town to start the murder all over again. You may steal horses and wagons. You may murder indiscriminately. You may burn houses. You may unleash a reign of terror across the RDR2 countryside the likes of which man has never seen. And when you tire of gleeful mayhem, you may proceed to the next story marker and resume the narrative as if nothing has occurred.Red Dead Redemption 2 is about Rockstar. It is about Houser’s gang. It is about making the most successful video games in the world, and then having to make them again and again.“You keep killing people,” Arthur says, looking on horror as Dutch strangles a woman for pulling a knife on him. By this point in the game, I — as Arthur — have shot, stabbed, exploded, run over, or assassinated literally hundreds of people. Many in cold blood. I have invaded people’s homes to rob and/or murder them. I have burned people alive. And yet here, in this moment, the game demands I feel horrified that my friend has murdered a single person in self defense.I have slain man and beast. Often I will slay a man and/or beast and need to transport their body somewhere else to get paid for the slaying. So I hoist the remains over my shoulder, and then sling them over the butt of my horse. Afterwards both my shoulder and horse’s butt will display realistic splashes of blood. Occasionally, as I carry remains (or wounded fellows) I will wade through water. Blood swishes behind me in believable fashion. Sometimes I will have blood on my hands and clothes after killing and skinning a beast,. Passersby will notice. They will say I look bloody or stink of carrion. This lavish and painstaking world notices when you’ve killed a single man or beast. Slay a hundred, though, and it shrugs.This is a good place to talk about the game’s “honor system.” Doing good or bad things will move your honor meter in the relative direction. At least in theory. Perhaps one of the most surprising aspects of RDR2 is exactly how many good and/or bad deeds you have to do to move the needle. Shooting a random stranger in the face barely makes a dent. Neither does robbing them. Shooting a horse: a little more. Refuse to help a speaking character with a quest, however, and it creates a seismic shockwave.Having “bad” honor make things cost a little more. Having “good” honor unlocks outfits.That’s it. After playing more than half of the game side-by-side with good and bad honor, I can tell you that very late in the game there are certain speeches from certain characters that might contain slightly different wording, but by-and-large the honor system that is tagged to and tracks every action you take in RDR2 has zero practical effect. Whether you are a good person or a bad person, you will go on the same missions, kill the same hundreds of police officers and other assorted humans, commit the same crimes, and watch helplessly again and again as your gang makes horrible decisions you are unable to impact in any way, shape, or form.Whether this is a good or a bad thing depends on how strictly you demand your entertainment adhere to realism. Or how willing and/or able you are to separate the gameplay from the narrative. The fact is, both of the experiences on offer in Red Dead Redemption 2 are excellent. The ludicrous shoot-em-up action game is the best such experience Rockstar has ever made. And the story is, perhaps, one of the most ambitious ever committed to pixels. If you’re the type of person for whom the presence of one doesn’t detract from the other, this game might be the best ever made. Either way, the near seamlessness between the two experiences is a marvel.As far as the narrative itself, it’s brilliant and terrible. It’s epic and overlong. It’s moving and predictable. Inspiring and exhausting. It is an achievement in video game writing, acting, directing, and motion capture. It will win awards. It will be remembered long after the game itself is rendered unplayable by the advance of technology. It is also gratuitously self-indulgent, derivative, and too goddamn long.The story of Arthur Morgan and the members of Dutch’s gang is easily the best story Rockstar head writer, Dan Houser has ever told. It is also the same story Houser has been telling for years, tweaked a bit, refined, and sharpened to a precise (if unwieldy) point. Dutch’s gang begins RDR2 on the run. If it seems like things get better from there, it is only a mirage. And no matter how bad things get for this gang, let me assure you they can (and will) get far worse. In Red Dead Redemption 2, you will play as multiple characters. You will fight multiple enemies. You will win and lose vast fortunes, make and break numerous alliances, and watch characters you have grown to love suffer and even die. This merry band of outlaws will flub attempt after attempt to strike one last big score, and eventually lose everything they’ve struggled to acquire.The duality of the game’s experience also creates a tangible emotional struggle. Playing as Arthur, my combat capabilities steadily improved as I acquired more loot and improved my equipment. But Arthur’s effectiveness as a character within the game’s story diminishes as he becomes older and suffers from various setbacks and ailments. Eventually I, as the player, begin to feel the creeping paranoia that is the recurring unseen character of the auteur’s milieu.And yet the game isn’t about any of that. Not really.Red Dead Redemption 2 is about Rockstar. It is about Houser’s gang. It is about making the most successful video games in the world, and then having to make them again and again. It is about being goaded by the government, betrayed by beloveds, and cajoling compatriots to sacrifice everything for “one last score.” It is about having a dream and chasing it for “all those years,” no matter the cost. It is about looking a gift horse in the mouth and then whipping it for 100 hours a week until it gets you all the way to Tahiti, what happens when it dies on you, and who will come looking to avenge you — and defeat you — after it all inevitably ends.The notoriously press-shy Houser has bared his soul about the trials and tribulations of running one of the world’s most successful video game studios, albeit through analogue and metaphor. That, if nothing else, makes RDR2 a true work of art that deserves every accolade. Given the game’s breadth, and it’s curious analogues, it would not surprise me if Houser never made another game again. But if he does, I sincerely hope someone talks him into making it a shorter one.This game was reviewed on PlayStation 4 using code provided by the publisher."
Red Dead Redemption 2,Sean  Cahill,Gaming Nexus,https://www.gamingnexus.com/Article/6028/Red-Dead-Redemption-2/,"Rockstar continues to be a machine that pumps out AAA titles that find the right balance of action, adventure, story and gameplay. It’s impressive that the company has maintained its standards and still met the demands of the gaming industry. Red Dead Redemption 2 has been out on consoles for over a year now, and it was met with almost universal praise. However, Rockstar had to acknowledge that the game wasn’t going to be read for PC gamers for about a year. They simply weren’t ready to put the product out because they didn’t want it to be a port. A year has passed, and the old time themed sandbox game is still amazing and gorgeous.Even after a year, it all feels fresh. For those who never played the game and specifically waited for it to launch on PC, the story involves the Van der Linde gang and their recovery from a botched heist in the town of Blackwater in 1899. Horses and carriages are the primary modes of travel for Arthur, the protagonist. Following in the footsteps of previous Rockstar games, the protagonist and his friends are not upstanding members of society. In short, Arthur and the gang are criminals. Yes, they are doing it to support their group but they’re not good people.The world is just a wonderful environment to enjoy and get lost in. While this isn’t the bustling metropolis of San Andreas or Liberty City like in Grand Theft Auto, there is a different beauty to this game. The flora, endless views off of cliffs and mountains, waterfalls, and many other surroundings immerse a player in the world. It’s easy to get lost in the game and just ride around on a horse finding new things, shooting animals for meat and pelts, and holding up unfortunate riders that the player can catch alone.I dipped my foot into RDR2 last year but never dove in because I was one of those players waiting for the PC launch. I had been itching to get a game that could truly push my system to the limits. Rockstar’s warning ahead of the game was that even the beefiest of graphics cards may have trouble running the game on ultra settings. Unfortunately, it took a little time to get into the game because graphical issues and bugs plagued the launch of the game. These things happen, and Rockstar handled it as best they could. However, there was one minor issue…Red Dead Redemption 2 killed my graphics card. Well...sort of, rather. My specs for my PC include a Core i7-8700K, 32GB of memory and a couple of SSDs that are used for booting and data storage, including running some of my Steam games. I was also sporting an nVidia GTX 1060 OC in my system. My motherboard and processor had no issues handling things, but the graphics card was not having any luck getting about the standard settings. Even at the baseline, the right side of my screen was glitching out and losing sight of characters, trees, and whole pieces of scenery. After the patches went through that Rockstar sent out, I hoped that things had been resolved and I could continue on.Nope. Not even close.Unfortunately, my graphics card picked the worst time to say, “Carry on without me,” and eventually died. More than likely, this was just very bad timing. However, I was able to replace it quickly with a 1660 Ti thanks to warranty coverage. It made the best of a bad situation, and thankfully it helped with this review as I was able to push the limits of the graphic settings. It’s still not recommended to go with full graphic settings unless you have an incredible system. Maybe those out there with 2080s or the new AMD line can push it up without sending their system into meltdown. As for me, the new card was able to handle the graphics on a more than acceptable level. I hung around 55 frames per second once the new card was installed on my Acer Z35 Predator. I’m happy to report that the game supports ultrawide monitors as well, so there were no black bars on the sides.This world is simply stunning. I can’t get over the amount of detail that is crammed into this game. Yes, it’s a different experience than a GTA title, but that’s why it’s so good. In GTA, everything is moving. There are cars, pedestrians, police, fire, etc. Dodging all of those while doing missions and occasionally plowing into a crowd of people might be one person’s niche, but RDR brings a different world that is vibrant and lush with animals, people, and a growing society...even if they’re quite scattered. I know this is a tad redundant but it’s worth mentioning twice.Arthur’s traversal into this open world is dictated by missions, side quests, or just open roaming. The player will determine whether Arthur sticks to robbing other criminals for the greater good of the camp or decides that everyone is fair game. My favorite part was hunting down bounties, far and away. Each one had a different story and level of difficulty to receive the reward at the end. The very first one made me laugh a bit as it was a literal snake oil salesman claiming that everything he sold was safe, yet it was clear he was out to swindle. Later on those interactions become more challenging, taking on dangerous men who shoot first and ask questions later.I found myself almost avoiding missions at times because they have a wild disparity in difficulty and enjoyment. I prefer the missions to be action sequences and have a general purpose at the end, yet there’s one mission where it’s all about getting drunk in a saloon and not losing track of your partner. It was disorienting, boring, and frustrating to get through that. However, when missions are full of action, it makes it worth the slog of the other missions. There is one exception to this, and that’s the performance in the theater that made me sit back and enjoy. Arthur’s character is as good as a player wants to make him. Arthur goes through waves of anger and determination, yet turns into a giant teddy bear when the women of the group are involved. It took awhile for me to warm up to him, even though the biggest draw of Rockstar characters is the fact that I’m playing a criminal who has a story that is generally a dark one.Arthur didn’t really latch onto me like Niko did in GTA IV or any of the main protagonists in GTA V, but over my time of playing with the grizzled gunman, I understood his goal. He simply wants to survive and prosper, and his diary entries helped me understand that. It’s such a nice touch to pull out the journal and read what Arthur is thinking. He may not always agree with his brothers in crime and he may not want to help every person that asks for it, but the soliloquy that he sometimes gives in his many ways makes it worth pushing forward to the endgame. Red Dead Online is a frustrating experience early on but probably worth it in the long run. Full disclosure: I’m not much for online modes like RDR Online or GTA Online. I have traversed them in the past from time to time, but never for long runs. Red Dead Online is different in that there’s a little bit of everything for players, but the leveling system is rough. I expect there to be a curve to unlocking the best stuff in a game mode, but some of the simplest stuff that should be available to a player has almost ridiculous experience points requirements to hit. I didn’t have much of a thirst for it, so I stuck primarily to the single-player mode.Final thoughts. Regardless of if you played RDR2 on console or not, you’re in for a treat just from the visual upgrades a beefy gaming PC can offer. Arthur grows on you, much like his beard grows throughout the game if you don’t tend to it. There’s a fantastic open world waiting to be explored and is either ripe for the taking or there to build a reputation with. The story flows for the most part, give or take some clunkers when it comes to missions here and there, but it’s worth repeating that for every boring mission, there’s a train heist waiting for you around the corner, possibly. As with any Rockstar game, it’s an open world and you can play it how you want. The campaign itself seems to be around 40 to 50 hours, depending on how hard you go at it. For me, I was perfectly content doing all of the side missions and exploration, and I wouldn’t have it any other way.A gorgeous world with so much to explore awaits everyone. It's not without some faults, and those with older spec'd PCs may have trouble running this. If you've got the rig to handle it, it's a wonderful experience.* The product in this article was sent to us by the developer/company.Sean is a 15 year veteran of gaming and technology writing with an unhealthy obsession for Final Fantasy, soccer, and chocolate.

Red Dead Redemption 2,Lou Sytsma,COGconnected,https://cogconnected.com/review/red-dead-redemption-2-review-2/,"On October 26, 2018 Rockstar Games released, or unleashed might be more appropriate, a digital experience in the guise of a game, Red Dead Redemption 2. The gaming world was left in awe for Rockstar released a game not only vast in scope but intricate in detail. Here was an experience where you could drill down into the weeds and still find something to interact with. It was a mind-boggling achievement that has set so many bars in gaming.Nineteen months later, Rockstar is ready to release RDR2 on the PC. Rather than dwell too much on the details already covered in that review, my aim is to highlight the differences, updates, and additional content the PC version. The pitfalls of bringing the game to the heterogeneous, aka the wild west if you will, world of the PC will be looked at too.The beauty of RDR2 is you can play the game the way you want. You can follow the main storyline or wander off tracking humans or animals. Or switch back and forth which you will likely be want to do. If there is one thing RDR2 has in spades is depth. Not just in the world but in characterization too. Rockstar has created a very layered protagonist in Arthur Morgan. Much like Eastwood’s aged gun for hire Bill Munny in Unforgiven, Morgan is a man who has seen a lot and done a lot. Some of it good and some of it bad. Through his eyes we see the beginning of the taming of the wild and the cost of such taming. Progress is part of human nature but progress is a wheel that runs roughshod over anything and everything in its path. It’s not a pretty process. Trees are cut down, crystal clear water becomes tainted, and clear air is stained with the smoke of trains and factories.This diminishment of the untamed west is echoed in the aging Morgan. He sees not only his world breaking down but himself. You can have Morgan look in the mirror at himself and make rueful marks about the wear and tear his outlaw life has put on his body. He lives in a hard world where survival is an ever-present force that drives people to harsh lengths to make it through another day. Contrasted against this harsh life is the beauty of the outdoors. From clear running streams to rugged mountaintops to the glorious site of seeing a stag running across a landscape backlit by a rising sun; it all takes your breathe away. While you can fun with Morgan whether out carousing or playing cards or just out riding his horse and singing, there’s no escaping the undertone of sadness running throughout the game. Most of the characters you come to care about meet bad ends and this is a tale that will stick with you.Red Dead Redemption 2 on the PC launched on Nov 9th with the following additional material: 3 new Bounty Hunting missions, two new Gang Hideouts, two new treasure taps, a new Stranger quest, five new trinkets quests and Story Mode has five additional new weapons including the LeMat revolver. Previously this weapon was only available in the online mode. And don’t worry, the horses get some love in this version as well. Appropriate given the strong bond between a cowboy and his steed. New horses, each with their own attributes have been added to the Story Mode. They include the Warped Brindle Arabian, Few Spot Appaloosa, Perlino Andalusian and Red Chestnut Arabian, as well three new horse variations for the background horses.So, needless to say that, the 100 hours of gameplay for the console version is extended even further here. Plus if you decide to play online – well, this could be where you spend the rest of your life. For the online mode, you can customize either a male or female character with standard paper doll selections.Now the tech side things are a bit formidable. Minimum specs for Red Dead Redemption 2 call for an Intel i5-2500K or AMD FX-6300 CPU and for your GPU either Nvidia GeForce GTX 770 2GB or AMD Radeon R9 280 3GB cards. The recommended specs for graphics are Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 6GB or AMD Radeon RX 480 4GB paired with either Intel i7-4770K or AMD Ryzen 5 1500X. While 8GB of RAM will work the game recommends 12GB. Obviously the minimum specs will yield one a pretty bare-bones experience. It’s often painful for the pocketbook to maintain a PC that adequately runs a huge AAA game. Speaking of size, you’ll need 112 GB of disk space for the game – 150GB during the install.For the PC version, Rockstar has upped the ante not only for content but on the eye candy front too. The goal is to push the immersion and detail as far as possible to create the ultimate version of Red Dead Redemption 2. The game’s lighting engine has been enhanced so there are improvements in not only daytime but at night as well. Further improvements have been made to shadows. Further to increasing the sensation of a living, breathing world the draw distances go far beyond what is available on console. While giving the player the sensation of a bigger world, the game also drills down deeper with improved textures and greater detail to not only the flora and fauna but manmade items too.Of course to take full advantage of all the graphical upgrades you’ll need a bleeding-edge PC to do so. If you are like me and are running a machine you haven’t upgraded in the last two or three years, you’ll have to dial back the settings. My rig is an interesting mix as I run the minimum spec Intel i5-2500k CPU but have a Nvidia GTX 1070 8GB video card. I fiddled with the settings to get as close to a 60fps setting as possible which meant going with medium settings for a lot of the graphic choices. I do have the game installed on an SSD drive.As with games this complex and resource-demanding, issues have arisen for PC players trying to play the game. Rockstar has already released one patch and they can be expected to continue to work and resolve issues. By far the most annoying bug is one where the game pauses intermittently. The video stops yet the audio continues on. So if you are in conversation with someone or in the middle of an action sequence, you can hear it playing it but you are unable to do anything until your PC catches up with the game. Rockstar recommends disabling your Windows virus protection for now to get around the issue but doing so made no difference for me.These are early days for the PC release and hopefully, the technical issues are addressed in the coming days. As things stand now, unless you have a top-notch PC, chances are you’re running a rig like mine and will have to make graphical compromises that leave you experiencing the game in a presentation fairly similar to that on the consoles. Regardless, this is unquestionably a brilliant experience. Everything about this version is bigger and better than the console version providing you have the rig to run it on.*** PC code provided by the publisher ***Developer: Rockstar GamesPublisher: Rockstar Games"
Red Dead Redemption 2,Steven Wong,PC Invasion,https://www.pcinvasion.com/red-dead-redemption-2-pc-review/,"It’s almost hard to believe that it’s only been a year since Red Dead Redemption 2 launched for console systems. The PC version includes all of its glorious, open-world gameplay along with some additional content and major graphical enhancements. Although the graphical upgrades may strain low to mid-range systems, the beauty and expansive open world could make these upgrades worthwhile. However, there are a few issues with the port that shouldn’t be overlooked.Red Dead Redemption 2 for PC features highly detailed clouds, grass, and animal fur along with enhanced lighting and shadows.Red Dead Redemption 2 takes place during the waning days of the Wild West, as the Van der Linde gang gradually makes its way toward its final sunset. But there’s still plenty to do while the gang struggles to survive. Tasks include everything from fishing and hunting for food, to being a bounty hunter, robbing trains, and plenty more. There’s so much to do in this vast open world that I often lost myself in it, shooting animals between missions, or saving up for much-needed upgrades to the gang’s campsite.Players take the role of Arthur Morgan, who must use his skills as a gunman and outlaw to help everyone survive, even as the law closes in on them. The narrative is quite expansive and is almost sure to consume days or even weeks of your life without you realizing it.Tutorials are expertly integrated into missions, so you can learn the many different game systems as you play. Additionally, the game seems to go out of its way to be as authentic as possible, such as having to manually cock single-action guns or turning things like looting bodies and skinning animals into relatively long and time-consuming actions. All the while, players need to keep their core health, the weather, and even their cleanliness in mind. Otherwise, these can negatively impact what Arthur can do.The good news is that the game does have streamlined functions like fast travel. The bad news is, it seems to only work one way. But I grew used to these mechanics, and they ended up immersing me more deeply into the world. Using a mouse to quickly and precisely aim also helped make some of the shootouts much easier, especially when combined with time-slowing focus to take out people behind Gatling guns.The PC version features a host of content that wasn’t available for the console versions, but that fact is easy to overlook if it’s not explicitly pointed out to you. They include extra Bounty Hunting missions, a couple more treasure maps, a list of new weapons, horses, and more.What truly makes an impact are the PC-specific features, particularly the high-end graphics and the genuine photo mode. Graphical enhancements include longer draw distances compared to the console version, which is remarkably handy for hunting… or just taking in the view. The PC release also includes better lighting and shadows, high resolution textures, and tessellation to make plants and animals appear more lifelike than ever. The final results are quite stunning.However, balancing between beauty and performance can be quite a task and may require a fair bit of experimenting. Even after running the benchmark a dozen times to fine-tune the settings, I’ve experienced frequent graphical stutters.It wasn’t uncommon for the game to drop from around 50 frames per second (FPS) to around 35 FPS, then jump back up just as quickly. Also, it didn’t seem to matter whether I was riding in open plains or down narrow streets. These little hiccups happened everywhere, and occurred even when I tuned the graphics down to medium, so they almost seem arbitrary. I noticed that the game reads frequently from the hard drive, so that might be a factor, even though I have the game installed on an SSD. It’s possible that these stutters happen as the game loads in new areas.The weird thing is that the delays aren’t limited to the in-game graphics. There’s a noticeable lag with the menu system too. Menu options like save slots don’t always highlight immediately when you click on them, which usually means using the keyboard to navigate if you need things done quickly.But even though the stuttering is annoying, it’s not game-breaking. I never felt as though a stutter threw off my shots or caused me to die. On the other hand, the game did crash on me a few times during the worst possible moments – like when I had just cleared a bandit camp or hunted down a hard-to-catch animal.So, maybe Red Dead Redemption 2 could have benefitted from a little more development time, but then PC players wouldn’t have a chance to get into this incredible world.For me, the most frustrating thing about Red Dead Redemption 2 wasn’t necessarily the technical problems. It was with being an outlaw. Specifically, it was how incredibly difficult it can be to be a bad guy (or even a good guy) in the Old West.Players usually have a limited time to loot mission area before the law shows up to start shooting. Even if you ride off quickly, these lawmen have some sort of Arthur-seeking detector, and they’ll find you wherever you are unless you can get out of the search zone.Additionally, people will turn you in for the dumbest things. I once shot what I thought was a wild turkey and someone reported me for animal abuse. Searching the body of someone who tried to kill me got me reported for looting. Accidentally bumping my horse-drawn wagon into someone else’s got me tagged for vandalism.Despite being able to put on a mask, the law will almost always home in on you. Even if they’re unable to make an arrest, they’re still able to put bounties on you. There’s no such thing as doing things quietly, either. Breaking into a room and using silent arrows and throwing knives to slaughter everyone inside before they can fire off a single shot does nothing. Lawmen will still come flooding in from everywhere to put bullets through you.It’s about here that having high accuracy ended up being kind of a bad thing. I could mow down lawmen by the dozen. But the more people I killed to get out of a situation, the higher my bounty got, causing bounty hunters to appear from out of nowhere to chase me down.Even after paying for minor infractions, nobody lets you forget about that time you accidentally killed some guy’s pet turkey. You might as well wear one around your neck like an albatross. My question is, why doesn’t anyone ever run to the cops when people suddenly start shooting at me for no reason?Additionally, if there’s any game that desperately needs a quick save function, it’s Red Dead Redemption 2. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to find one when scrolling through the keyboard controls, which limited me to manual saves. However, players may be prevented from saving during certain points, such as during missions or at times when someone is talking at you.Playing Red Dead Redemption 2 on the PC is kind of a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it’s a deeply immersive game with breathtaking graphics. On the other, you’ll probably need hardware that’s well above the recommended system requirements to get the most out of the game. Even then, you’ll have to deal with more than a few strange gameplay quirks.But after sinking so many hours into the game, I can say that it’s all worth it. The campaign tells an amazing story, and finally managing to upgrade your camp and loadout is fantastically rewarding. The PC release also happens to be the fullest in terms of content and features. So, if you haven’t played the game before on consoles, the PC edition is definitely the one to have.It reaches a point where, even when you’re not playing Red Dead Redemption 2, you’re still thinking about playing it and checking off everything on your long to-do list before riding off into the sunset.Although Red Dead Redemption 2 for the PC has plenty of technical quirks, they're easy to overlook once you're immersed in the story and the breathtaking beauty of the world.
