Devil May Cry 5,Martin Robinson,Eurogamer,https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-03-06-devil-may-cry-5-review-an-unashamedly-old-school-retooling-of-an-action-classic,"Better the devil you know.Style is everything, and Devil May Cry 5 has it in spades. It's in the blithe way rakish new character V holds a book of poetry and reads from it in the middle of battle. It's in the adolescent aggression that flows through the attacks of Nero, the character who was front and centre in the last numbered entry finally coming into his own here. It's in the swagger of Dante - oh that sweet, sweet swagger - who brings along every trick he's learned in the series' long history alongside a few new ones. It's an outrageously broad vocabulary of punishment that Devil May Cry 5 boasts. In full flow Devil May Cry 5 is a savage, spectacular action game, stylish to the extreme if not exactly fashionable. After the Shoreditch edge of 2013 prequel DmC: Devil May Cry, this is a return to the more classically teenage boy concerns of old; it's all long hair, leather jackets, motorbikes and demons and music that raaaaaaaaaaawwwks. I absolutely love it, even if perhaps the one misstep here is a failure to acknowledge Ninja Theory's frequently wonderful, wrongly maligned spin-off that feels a little like capitulation. This is Devil May Cry as you remember it from its noughties pomp, a rediscovery and thorough retooling rather than a reinvention. And so it feels and plays like a PlayStation 2 game. Maybe you see that as a slight, but I certainly don't intend it to be - PlayStation 2 games were awesome, and I admire Devil May Cry 5 for forgoing most mod cons to deliver a game that's unashamedly old school (save for the spectre of microtransactions, admittedly, though they're so slight that after my first playthrough I had to ask Capcom if they'd been removed entirely - they're still there, it turns out, as a shortcut to unlocking moves, but so generous is Devil May Cry 5's economy you've got to wonder why Capcom invited ill-will by keeping them in at all). The focus here is on action, and on pushing it to new extremes, and so intent is Devil May Cry 5 on doing so it doesn't have much time for other embellishments. That action is exquisite, thankfully, and more lavish than ever before. This isn't merely the feel of 60fps, but rather the real thing (on the X and Pro at least - base consoles do a noble job of keeping up, I'm told, and Digital Foundry will be along to do its thing shortly), and in the hand it's just dandy. The camera, which is freed up from Devil May Cry 4's stiff and semi-fixed offering, does a good job of keeping everything in frame, and there's a giddying amount to keep track of in what's always a fantastic looking game. The setting helps. Devil May Cry 5 takes place in Red Grave City, a lightly reimagined London with twisted little spins on recognisable places. An analogue of Regent Street gets torn asunder by a demonic apocalypse, while Burrow Market is based on - well, you can probably figure that one out yourself. It's dark and gothic and moody, even before you descend into the underworld, but Devil May Cry 5 wears the aesthetic well, always keeping on the right side of the thin line between stylish and sulky. As does its story, told via sumptuous cinematics that have the RE Engine flexing its muscles. It's standard the-stakes-have-never-been-higher stuff that centres on the core enigma of new character V, offering up few surprises in its twists and turns. Amid all its absurdities and contrivances, though, it finds an emotional throughline, thanks to an abundance of character and a neat structure. There's not quite the blunt backtracking of Devil May Cry 4, but it's certainly economic with its backdrops, telling a tale that winds throughout the course of a single day (with a handful of flashbacks thrown in for good measure). Did it make me cry? Of course not, but it did make me laugh out loud on more than one occasion, and the cutscenes have a cinematic swagger all of their own. That Devil May Cry swagger is at its most pronounced in the action itself, of course. Levels are lavish, if curiously old-fashioned - there are awkward platforming sections, puzzles that are there to be blunt-forced rather than seriously thought through - and it's here that Devil May Cry 5 feels the most dated. Perhaps it's because we've been spoiled by the set-pieces and flair of Bayonetta and its sequel - both those games having come since the last numbered Devil May Cry, somewhat shockingly - but there's that strange feeling of playing a game so rooted in its PlayStation 2 origins, told with the muscle and flair of contemporary Capcom and its RE Engine. It looks great, in short, but plays it very straight. When those invisible barriers pop up and you're forced into combat, that mandate of serving up age-old thrills with modern visuals comes into its own. Devil May Cry 5 offers up three characters - locked off at certain points in the 20-mission campaign - who are so diverse in style it ends up feeling like three very different games. Happily, each one is as enjoyable as the other. Nero retains his grabby moveset from Devil May Cry 4, though it's flourished by his acquisition of the Devil Breaker - a prosthesis that can be swapped out with consumables acquired and loaded out before missions or found on the battlefield. It inspires a slightly strange, counter-intuitive feeling at first - we're so used to having our entire vocabulary to hand in action games - but it opens up a new layer of strategy, and several new layers of depth. Each type of Devil Breaker comes with its own attributes and moves, so one moment you might have access to a shockwave, while another the ability to heal. The permutations are dizzying, and make playing Nero a constant journey of discovery, and if, like me, you felt his starring role in Devil May Cry 4 felt something like an act of Metal Gear Solid 2-esque misdirection, then here he finds something like redemption. He even comes close to stealing the show. As does V, Devil May Cry 5's new addition who plays quite unlike anyone else in the series' past (well, okay maybe a little bit like one other character, but let's not go there for fear of spoilers). A sorcerer-style character, with more than a hint of Dragon's Dogma in the way he goes about business, V introduces ranged play as he fights from afar with the help of familiars - the avian Griffon, the panther-like Shadow and the demon Nightmare, all who can be controlled remotely before V steps in to finish the job off with his cane. It's a very different rhythm, and a welcome one too even if, in comparison to his companions, V ends up feeling a mite under-developed come his story's end.Those familiars might seem, well, familiar, too, having all featured as enemies of one sort or another in the series' very first outing. Devil May Cry 5 is full of such throwbacks and fan service, and of course there's no greater throwback than Dante himself, a playable compendium of the entire history of Devil May Cry. In the hand, he feels exactly as he should, and so painstaking is the commitment to make him faithful to his past selves at times playing Devil May Cry 5 feels more like you're engaging in a Resident Evil 2-esque remake than something entirely new. Switchable styles return, allowing you to flick between Trickster, Gunslinger, Swordmaster and, of course, Royal Guard, giving you access to different movesets that can be used in tandem with Dante's arsenal. The sheer breadth of it all can feel a little unwieldy at first, though you're given plenty of room to grow into it, and there's the promise of depths to be mined for countless playthroughs. It's all culled from familiar stuff, but this is the best Dante has ever felt. And as familiar as it is, there's still room for a new move here and there. The Cavaliere is Dante's headline new acquisition, a motorbike that can be torn in half to cleave through enemies. Or, if you'd prefer, just pull off an endo and grind the rear wheel into an enemy's face, a move as preposterous as it is satisfying. It's silly to the extreme, but nailed with the exquisite execution that can only come through a deathly serious approach. Such is the charm with Devil May Cry, really, an action game of outrageous extremes delivered with a craftsman's touch. Devil May Cry 5 is an inescapably backwards-looking title, though in referencing its past it discovers and invents whole new depths. It's the kind of thing where the first playthrough feels like simply the warm-up before you explore those reaches further with the help of higher difficulty levels, and that rewards you with spectacle the more you master it. Is it the measure of the action titles that come out of that other studio in Osaka? At times it feels a little too retrograde to be the best in class, but I'm certain it's the best Devil May Cry there's been yet - which is still quite the claim to be able to make. This is a more vintage type of action, though that ends up serving Devil May Cry 5 incredibly well. Style like this never really goes out of fashion, after all.You're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!

Buy it Steam (opens in new tab)Devil May Cry 5 is a 16-hour exploration of the hundreds of ways a magical man might hit a demon. There are swords and guns, of course, which you use interchangeably to create flowing, acrobatic combos. Alternatively, Devil May Cry’s ageing original hero Dante can hit demons with two halves of a haunted motorbike. Nero can slap on one of seven mechanical arms that can punch enemies with a big electric fist, or shoot rocket fists that punch demons from a distance. The magical antihero V commands a demonic condor and a panther to hit demons for him. All of these approaches look sensational, and feel so good that I’m happily ploughing into new game plus when the review is already finished. It hasn’t been a hard one to write because Devil May Cry 5 is simply one of the best games about hitting demons ever made.You switch between Nero, V, and Dante as the story dictates across DMC5’s 20 missions. A demon called Urizen is using a bad tree called the Qliphoth to drain the city of all its blood and it’s up to the trio to fight through his minions to stop him. The story is preposterous, genuinely funny at points, and supported by earnest performances and quality performance capture. Though many of the areas you visit can be simplistic and a touch monotone and washed out, it’s a decent enough setting for tremendous combat encounters.In classic Devil May Cry fashion you clear the level room-by-room and collect ranking scores from each encounter that feed into an overall score for the chapter. The point isn’t merely to survive, but to reach the upper echelons of the scoring system and claim the coveted, ridiculous ‘Smokin’ Sexy Style!’ title. The game marks your homework as you play and deducts points for repeating combos and taking hits. The game really sings as you start fighting at SSS level, switching weapons and zooming around the combat space to build a gorgeous improvisational combo of sword slashes, fire gauntlets punches, shotgun blasts and dazzling robot arm attacks.If you'd rather kick back admire the combat there's an 'auto' mode that executes some advanced combos for you—accessible by clicking in the right stick at any point in a level. Between that and the 'human' difficulty level, this is the most accessible Devil May Cry game yet for new players. In a series that proudly offers a high level of challenge, it's good to see players of all skill levels taken into account.Each character has their own fighting style, but there’s plenty of opportunity to find your own preferred approaches within each moveset. Nero’s basic abilities let him attack with his sword and revolver. You can hold fire button to charge the gun and deliver bullets that can stagger enemies, and you can rev your sword like a motorbike to power it up and access fiery new moves. Nero can also whip enemies closer or pull himself towards larger enemies with a tether he fires out of his right arm.Within this stable framework of go-to combos you use Nero’s disposable robot arms to mix up combos or move around. The Gerbera arm lets you fire shockwaves that propel Nero away from enemy attacks, and the Punch Line can detach and fly around as Nero rides it. The arms break if you take a hit during their special move, but you tailor an arsenal of up to eight arms before a mission starts and detonate them whenever you like. Some arms do give you an advantage over certain enemies—the many lashing hits of the whip-like Helter Skelter can shatter guarding enemies, for example—but the system is lax enough to let you pick the arms you really enjoy using in any situation.You can make any enemy in the game wear a dumb hat. It even works on giant tentacle-faced rhino monsters. It even works on bosses.If Nero was the only playable character this would still be a fine game, but Devil May Cry 5 offers so much more. Dante can switch between four melee weapons, four ranged weapons, and four combat styles on the fly. This spectacular range of attacks in part harks back to previous Devil May Cry games with the classic sword combos and stinger dash, but his new abilities are even better. Dante can switch out his guns for a hat and scarf combo that lets him attack with the game’s red orbs currency. Lock on and launch a forward attack and Dante throws the hat onto the targeted enemy’s head. While demons are wearing the hat they shed orbs that you can collect and then throw right back at them. The hat is great because it demonstrates DMC5’s wilful tendency to be incredibly smart and stupid at the same time. You can build your whole combat style around the hat’s clever orb switching mechanics, and in a random nod to Journey, enjoy the way the red scarf grows longer as you collect orbs. But perhaps more importantly, you can make any enemy in the game wear a dumb hat. It even works on giant tentacle-faced rhino monsters. It even works on bosses.Devil May Cry 5 seems to be well optimised for PC, running at a comfortable 60 fps for the duration. There is a dedicated and comprehensive PC options menu that lets you tweak anti aliasing, lens flare, motion blur, subsurface scattering, shadow quality, shadow cache, refresh rate, and much more. You can rebind keyboard and mouse controls, though a control pad is hugely recommended.V is the palate cleanser of the three. He has a less developed set of abilities, but they feel quite different to Nero and Dante. V struts around the edges of the battle reading poetry from his book as his pet demons rip up enemies. The melee attack button controls attacks with V’s Panther, Shadow. The ranged attack command controls his eagle, Griffon. Once you’ve landed enough hits to build up your super gauge, you summon a massive oily golem called Nightmare to clobber everything into a near-death state. The demons can’t actually kill anything, so you have to teleport V around the battlefield to deal final blows with his cane. He does this as nonchalantly as possible.V’s style feels sloppier than Dante and Nero. The panther seems to just do its own thing sometimes and both creatures can teleport back to V’s side at inappropriate moments. If there are intricacies to the control system that stop this from happening, I haven’t found them. However, with a couple of move unlocks V reliably hits SSS rank thanks to the demons’ various area-of-effect attacks, which reliably overlap to juggle enemies. V's sections are a fun power trip and a nice breather from Nero and Dante’s surgical combat styles.Between missions you can pour red orbs into weapon abilities to unlock new moves. At some points you find payphones that summon the Devil May Cry van, driven by wisecracking tech support character Nico, who delivers some of the campaign’s funnier putdowns. Here you encounter the minor irritation of having to buy each Devil Breaker Nero arm that you plan to use. This, and a couple of poor boss fights are the main factors that really let the game down.Nero, Dante, and V don’t reach their full potential until the end of your first run through. The next difficulty level remixes every combat encounter and lets you keep all of your unlocks. The refresh is so extensive that it makes the main campaign feel like a mere tutorial, and this is before Capcom adds the bloody palace gauntlet mode in April. I’ve been hitting demons in this game for 19 hours so far, and I can easily see myself putting in 19 more. The setting lacks the flair and imagination of the genre behemoth Bayonetta, and those boss fights make it a slightly more uneven experience, but there’s a greater variety of combat styles and a higher degree of challenge that will will keep me playing until Capcom hopefully releases another one. If you enjoy third-person brawlers DMC5 is a must, and if you've never tried one before, this is a great place to start.

Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy.The best parts of Devil May Cry 5 (opens in new tab) aren't when I'm being most challenged, they're actually when I can cut through that challenge, when I'm in full flow pushing buttons without having to think about it, mentally flicking through a menu of outlandish moves to weave my own varied combos. Of course, make no mistake, the game has its fair share of hard-as-nails boss encounters and a bevy of increasingly hard difficulty modes that can absolutely make me crush my controller into a fine dust. But it's watching the style meter ticks up, adding extra layers to the pulse pounding soundtrack with my moves that's the major appeal. Devil May Cry 5 is an absolutely stunning return to form that builds on improvements Ninja Theory's spin-off and reimagining DmC. But for all the bright sparks, spurts of blood, raging fires and more action hitting the screen at once - all gloriously rendered in Capcom's own Resident Evil 7 (opens in new tab) RE engine - it’s always the character you’re controlling that’s your real focus. The true genius of Devil May Cry 5 is that it's not just a great action game - it's three. You play as Dante, Nero and V, and each of these playable characters are so unique that I might as well be playing different games that share a narrative. These are no simple reskins. As you fight your way through hordes of demons on your way to Qliphoth, the massive demon tree from Hell that's invaded Red Grave City, it's easy to see that each character is based on the same framework. Everyone has a long range attack, a close range attack, a dodge/evade, a lock on, and a couple of unique moves mapped to other buttons and so on. The rating system revolves around avoiding being hit, and making sure you're using a variation of moves, regardless of who you play as. But that's where the similarities end.Nero's intricacies like his heavy-hitting revolver, the sword with motorbike throttle handle that you can rev mid-combo for stronger attacks, and more return. But this time, his unique arm - a literal demon arm - has been stolen for plot reasons, meaning he's got a slot for an interchangeable robot arm. These, known as Devil Breakers, are littered around the levels to pick up or available to buy from the customisation shop. From abilities ranging from whips to rocket punches, they're all pretty crazy, and always come with the ability to grapple enemies from a distance, which is handy. However, you can't switch them out on the fly, which feels a little annoying at first, though it's clear that it's meant to encourage you to mix up the powerful moves to get through them. You can break them entirely, which lets you unleash a powerful attack and switch to a new arm, but it'll just be to whatever is next in your arm magazine. Seriously. Particularly intense moments see deft use of all the arms in your magazine to run rings around your enemies. It's terrific fun, but so much so that the Devil Breakers can overshadow things like Nero's Exceed system - the robo-arms are just more well developed. It's easy to get carried away and forget to make best use of Exceed when you're distracted with the Devil Breakers, but it does end up feeling pretty satisfying when you do manage it.Dante is the least changed from his previous appearances. He's still all about swapping between a large arsenal of guns and close-quarters weapons on the fly; as well as switching styles between Gunslinger, Trickster, Sword Master, and Royal Guard, which give you access to different moves depending on what you have active. Considering you can switch between all of these mid-combo, the options are immense. Fittingly you don't get to play as him until around the midpoint of the game, so the slightly more complex aspect of switching between all these things feels much easier by that point. New weapons offer great new twists on his gameplay, feeling right at home alongside returning and revised classics - a fitting metaphor for Devil May Cry 5 as a whole.It's V that offers the freshest gameplay for the series, and understandably would make veterans the most hesitant. Instead of getting involved in the action himself, he summons demons to do the dirty work first before zapping in with a finishing move. You have the option to summon three demons, which are all based on enemies from the first game, but functionally they provide the same roles as the other two devil hunters’ weapons.Griffon fires long range zaps, and the panther-like Shadow uses claws and tentacles. The main difference is you're remotely controlling them, giving you a fresh perspective on encounters as you hang back, waiting to land that final strike with your cane. Summoning the third demon, Nightmare, uses your devil trigger meter, and he'll mostly just destroy everything around him without you having to worry about it. V adds a new dimension to the series that proves Capcom can continue to innovate as well as refine what came before.All three characters team up to take down the demon tree that's torn up this sort of “Not London”, Red Grave City. The ruined city has some interesting environments you don't get to see a lot in games, and being from the UK it was nice to see designs inspired by where I live, even if that's just things like big red public telephone boxes (which you use to call up Nico, the engineer of Nero's arm, and all-round customisation shopkeeper queen). While fun to a degree, the settings do at times lean towards the same colour palettes of browns and reds, especially as the action moves deeper into the Qliphoth tree. It would have been exciting to see the inside riff on the idea of bright, bizarre flora more than the repeated thorny vine theme, as the bright early morning colours of the previous levels felt very fresh.That doesn't detract too much from the game's appeal as a whole though, especially as each character has unique missions, which is a big step away from the huge amount of repetition in Devil May Cry 4. At points you'll even see the others fighting their own way through sections in the distance, which is rather cleverly drawn from actual player combat data. Perhaps you'll even see me in the distance! Because each of the 20 or so missions is one character or the other, that doesn't leave you with a whole heap of missions per character, but that also means nothing really overstays its welcome. The appeal is, as always with Devil May Cry, on replaying for more stylish scores, to challenge higher difficulties, and find all the hidden orbs and secret missions.Even on easier difficulties the game retains a reasonable amount of challenge and plenty of options to feel like you're overcoming them with stylish scores without being too unforgiving. The option for the game to give you auto-combos also helps as an entry point for new players. For a game that can have such a high skill ceiling with crazy combos, it's excellent to see genuine care taken with welcoming newcomers. The story though is mostly going to be hot nonsense for those unfamiliar with the series, as it references and pays off on a surprising amount of lore - though enough is unique to this adventure and explained to the point where it makes a certain amount of thrilling sense. It's a wild, exhilarating ride from start to finish.Reviewed on PS4 Pro and Xbox One.PLAY editor Oscar Taylor-Kent first joined Official PlayStation Magazine in 2018, and was involved with the long-standing mag’s rebrand into PLAY before becoming editor.

Devil May Cry 5,Joe Juba,Game Informer,https://www.gameinformer.com/review/devil-may-cry-5/a-stylish-return-to-form,"The Devil May Cry series began with Dante, a lone demon hunter. Today, he’s not so lonely; other playable characters have rotated in over the years, including Vergil, Nero, Trish, and Lady. Devil May Cry 5 expands the cast again with V, a mysterious man who uses demonic companions to fight. V offers a unique approach to DMC’s stylish battles compared to the slash-and-shoot mechanics of Dante and Nero, but his addition comes at a cost: Bouncing among three characters provides fun variety, but it keeps you wading in the shallows of combat too long, rather than letting you dive into its impressive depths.The core appeal of Devil May Cry is stringing moves together to form your own elaborate and spectacular combos. Devil May Cry 5 generally delivers a precise and satisfying (if familiar) version of that formula. You launch underworld abominations into the air, slice them up, and blast them from afar, all using responsive controls that make it easy to cut through the horde. The story is ridiculous and barely coherent, but it works thanks to a few awesome moments I can’t spoil here. All this serves as a consistently entertaining foundation, and all three playable heroes add their own variations.You start playing as Nero, who still uses his sword, gun, and grab to combine mobility and lethality. The biggest change from previous entries comes from his robotic arms. Each arm gives you different powers, like firing off a metal fist to pummel an enemy, super-charging your attacks, or giving you an extra mid-air dash. In theory, this system expands your arsenal with lots of new tricks. In practice, it isn’t fun to manage. Several arms have contextual utility, but you can’t switch among them manually; you have to break (i.e. waste) your limited supply until you get to the one you want. Plus, the arms cost orbs to replenish – the same currency you use to buy your moves and health upgrades – so spending resources on them feels like throwing your money away. Ultimately, they are fun to experiment with, but they aren’t powerful or interesting enough to warrant the hassle and expense.Controlling V offers a departure from tradition, since his approach is all about staying back while directing his demonic allies’ actions and summoning a brute when his Devil Trigger fills. Since his distance from the fray makes him less likely to get hit, I had the easiest time racking up SSS ranks with V. However, executing his companions’ specific moves feels less reliable. Even though using V to plow through fodder enemies is cool, his haphazard style isn’t great for focused encounters, and provides a diminished sense of strategic accomplishment.Dante has some new weapons (like dual rocket launchers) and a twist on his Devil Trigger, but he is the least surprising and most fun of the three heroes. Switching among various styles and weapons feels like the classic DMC I love, and I’m glad Dante’s the one squaring off against DMC 5’s most fearsome foes. That’s not something you can change, since only 2 missions (of 21 total) let you choose your hero; the other 19 are locked in as either Nero, V, or Dante.This assigned-character structure creates a few frustrations. You play as Nero for a bit, and then you switch to V. But V is a blank slate, so you have to start from scratch, often re-buying abilities (like increased speed) that are practically identical to what you’ve already bought for Nero. Then you do the same thing again when Dante unlocks. This gives the pacing a weird, start-and-stop sensation that makes it hard to gain momentum. Once you start to get in the groove with one character, a mandatory swap is always just around the corner.The diffuse gameplay focus also prevents you from accessing the full complexity of each character in a single playthrough. With my time (and orbs) split among three heroes, I felt like I only had the opportunity to climb halfway up the ladder to mastery with any one of them before I finished the final mission. Capcom must have recognized this problem, because the solution appears to be making sure none of the fights require full comprehension of your capabilities – even on Devil Hunter, which is the hardest option available at the start. I’m not saying the game is a total cakewalk, but I was about halfway through my second playthrough (on the next difficulty level up) when I finally hit fights that tested my limits, made me practice techniques, and forced me to improve – something Devil May Cry games normally deliver before the credits roll.However, once you finally reach the depths, Devil May Cry 5 stands shoulder-to-shoulder with its predecessors. Each character has a solid complement of moves and abilities to play with, and some of the more difficult enemy configurations almost feel like puzzles as you prioritize and control the crowd while trying to maximize your rank and keep your health high for the next encounter. I like how the removal of manual-use items (like green and purple stars) prevents you from brute-forcing tough fights, but I also appreciate that you still have gold orbs to let you keep fighting when victory is within sight. All of these wrinkles  (and more surprises I won't ruin) kept me hooked post-game, though I wish the game provided more gameplay-related incentives to keep playing on other than the simple satisfaction of getting better and finishing harder modes.For all of its pacing issues, Devil May Cry 5 is still a lot of fun to play. Combat is a blast, and the cutscenes are delightfully absurd; fans of Devil May Cry 3 and 4 should feel right at home here. Capcom goes back to the baseline action I’ve always enjoyed, and executes that with the series’ signature over-the-top style. However, this entry’s changes and additions to that core experience don’t enhance what the series does well; they feel more like roadblocks than steps forward.

   on November 9, 2020 at 2:31PM PSTEditor's note: This review was originally published in March 2019. Devil May Cry 5 Special Edition, which will soon be available on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, features a number of additions on top of what we've covered here. See our impressions of DMC5 Special Edition on PS5 for more details.As you send demons flying across the screen in Devil May Cry 5, a strong sense of familiarity will hit you. This is ""old school"" Devil May Cry, a simplistic network of hallways and arenas where you humiliate demons with absurd weaponry as a thumping battle theme fuels the bliss of every well-executed combo. DMC5 marks a return to the previous series continuity, and everything you remember about how those games played has been resurrected and improved. It is a brilliant iteration of the series’ best qualities--but it innovates as much as it reiterates, balancing new and old with infectious confidence.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Devil May Cry 5 Quick Video ReviewThe majority of your time in DMC5 is spent killing demons. With an array of melee and projectile attacks, you inflict complex combo strings while performing split-second dodges to evade incoming attacks. An in-game ranking system continually judges your style, encouraging you to better your performance. Protagonists Nero, Dante, and newcomer V each offer their own unique playstyles that makes the simple objective of clearing rooms of enemies continually exhilarating. Combat is where the game most expresses itself, showcasing the nuances of its mechanical depth in a variety of creative ways.Nero is where new and old ideas come together. Replacing his lone Devil Bringer from DMC4 are new prosthetic arms called Devil Breakers. With them, you can pull enemies towards you, as well as tap into an assortment of special abilities depending on which Devil Breaker model you have equipped. For example, Overture can deliver a wide shock attack, while Punch Line shoots a rocket-powered fist that continuously damages enemies. Devil Breakers significantly evolve Nero’s playstyle by expanding his attacks, but what’s most curious is how switching between them requires you to discard your current one in order to equip the next down the line. At first, this seems like an arbitrary way to access each arm’s unique abilities--not to mention there’s little done to justify this rule in-game other than asserting that they’re simply ""fragile.""However, this limitation introduces a thrilling spontaneity to combat that encourages you to be industrious and adaptable. You’re initially compelled to be frugal with Devil Breakers, but as you expand the number you can carry, you start hitting a rhythm expending them with strategic grace, flowing from one stylish combo to the next. But even with the best reflexes, an enemy can shatter a Devil Breaker mid-combo, which forces you to adjust your strategy on the fly. A persistent tension underlies using Nero’s Devil Breakers, melding high-consequence tactics with impulsive creativity. The gratifying free-flowing strategies that Devil Breakers inspire makes it easy to overlook any initial frustrations. They present a brilliant dichotomy that strengthens and amplifies the idiosyncrasies of Nero's more accessible playstyle.Where Nero brings new flair to classic mechanics, V is fresh and unexpected. Unlike his sword-touting brethren, V damages enemies from afar with his two familiars: a shape-shifting panther named Shadow and a demonic bird named Griffon (DMC1 fans should instantly recognize these creatures). The former inflicts melee attacks, while the latter shoots projectiles. Each have their own regenerating health bar and can be taken out of combat temporarily if you're not careful. V also has a third familiar named Nightmare. This giant golem acts as more as a Devil Trigger-like last resort who can inflict ridiculous damage all on his own for a short duration. In addition, it can be commandeered to inflict more direct assaults on enemies. An enemy cannot be killed by a familiar’s attacks alone, though; V himself must inflict the final blow. V requires a patience that goes against your general instinct to be confrontational. As a result, his more deliberate pace can be occasionally irritating, especially when your familiars have trouble focusing on the proper target during a hectic fight. It’s a bit disorienting due to the lack of feedback from hitting enemies with your familiars.Despite this, V’s emphasis on space management and calculated movement is a fantastic change of pace. Cunningly avoiding attacks as you command your familiars to deliver complex juggles is a satisfying thrill. And it's made all the more rewarding by the impact of a final blow alongside V's brief poetic soliloquies. V demands restraint, a quality that defies the offensive strategies of previous characters. His abilities may not seem like much, but he reframes the way DMC is played, demonstrating that there's still room for original and refreshing ideas in combat. V's inventive playstyle is a superb addition that feels right at home alongside Nero and Dante.Old-timer Dante most maintains traditional mechanics, but he’s also where combat is most creative. Like his DMC4 counterpart, he’s able to seamlessly switch between four different fighting styles, each with their own unique maneuvers and setups. This time, though, he can equip up to four weapons and four guns. It’s a joy to perform combos with Dante‘s extensive arsenal; you're capable of rush-stabbing a demon, break-dance-fighting them while they’re down, and then propelling them into the air with a demonic motorcycle chainsaw.While part of the fun is taking in the spectacle of a fight, playing as Dante is really about expressing yourself. There are so many attack combinations available that you can’t help but get sucked into learning the nuances of his every ability to achieve your desired style and flair. DMC historically excels when it’s continually motivating you to not only master its systems, but to execute upon them as elegantly and creatively as possible. Eventually, you get into a kind of flow with Dante, where combat is less about thinking than it is about feeling your way through it. Each character in DMC5 exemplifies this depth and intensity, but it’s with Dante’s open-ended combos where it feels most liberating and rewarding.With an abundance of fighting systems to learn, it helps that you’re gradually weaned into them. The campaign’s pacing is deliberate, starting you with the more accessible Nero, then switching you to strategic spacing of V before opening up combat entirely with Dante. But even as you grow accustomed to how everyone plays, new mechanics are constantly introduced, keeping you thoroughly engaged in the highs of DMC5's stylish combat.There are plenty of foes that test your abilities, too. Bosses in particular offer the most rewarding trials, with different challenges to suit each character's playstyle. For instance, one pushes Dante's ability to maintain quick and effective damage, where another is tailored specifically to V's vulnerability at close-range, forcing you to frequently manage your spacing while keeping your familiars in play. There are a couple bosses tied to relatively anticlimactic set pieces, but these are few and far between. The challenges are kept consistent, supplying riveting duels and new layers of complexity that inspire you to improve. And even with repeated deaths, a lenient continue system keeps the action and drama moving.Speaking of drama, DMC5’s story is an engrossing, albeit predictable, saga with plenty of extravagant action to keep you thoroughly entertained. It has a non-linear structure that has you switching perspectives to get the full picture, which lends variety to the events unfolding before you. Set in the duration of a single day, you're notified of the passing of time at the start of every mission. The narrative benefits from this approach to storytelling, keeping you invested in what each mission has to contribute to your understanding of the timeline.The return to familiar characters is perhaps the story’s most endearing quality. In fact, there are several loving nods to many of the series’ most iconic moments scattered throughout-- a particular instance involving Dante and a hat is a hilarious acknowledgement to the character's history. While some characters, like fan-favorites Trish and Lady, don’t have much to contribute, their presence at least brings a sense of camaraderie. However, a couple of nude scenes involving them come across as tasteless; with so many pleasing callbacks and references, moments like this awkwardly stand out. They feel cheap and unnecessary, hurting Trish and Lady's already minimal characterizations. It stands in stark contrast to the always delightful gunsmith Nico, who's established as headstrong, intelligent, and the reason why Nero is able to make short work of demons in the first place.The story ties a nice bow on the classic continuity’s unanswered questions, allowing for satisfying conclusions for its major protagonists.In spite of its more ambitious scale, DMC5's story leaves room for meaningful character development. It's by no means a nuanced study of its protagonists that digs deep into what makes them tick. But their motivations are always made abundantly clear, making for compelling melodrama whenever they clash against one another. You grow attached to their impassioned, if a bit simplistic, plights--if only to see how they'll overcome the harrowing challenges set before them. Ultimately, the story ties a nice bow on the classic continuity’s unanswered questions, allowing for satisfying conclusions for its major protagonists.There is an effort to pull DMC5's more grandiose moments together on a mechanical level with the Cameo System, which adds a subtle online cooperative element to the formula. Some missions often include the presence of another character exploring a nearby area or even acting alongside you. By default these characters are AI controlled, but through the Cameo System they're controlled either by other players online or their respective ghost data. A cool concept on paper, the feature is largely underutilized with only one particularly exciting instance where you actually get to fight alongside another player. That said, seeing another player from afar does add a novel yet fleeting solidarity to your journey.DMC5 thrives on the stylistic and mechanical prowess of its predecessors. It sticks to tradition above all else, pursuing a few ambitious new ideas along the way, but mostly maintaining the series’ focus on intricate fighting systems and campy bravado. Rarely does the game stumble, consistently leveraging its spectacle and mechanical depth to push aside any small frustrations. All the while, the story exudes a charismatic charm that keeps you constantly intrigued as you’re refining your skills. DMC5 proves the series can still be brilliant and imaginative without compromising its longest-held traditions.Devil May Cry 5 is featured as one of the best PS5 games.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"
Devil May Cry 5,Jeffrey Parkin,Polygon,https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/3/7/18253811/devil-may-cry-5-review-ps4-pc-xbox-one,"Filed under:Even newcomers will find something to enjoy in Devil May Cry 5, if they meet the heavy metal action game on its own termsWhen we first see Nero in Devil May Cry 5, he revs his sword like a motorcycle. That scratches the surface of the game’s mood. Later on, as Dante, I’m able to weaponize literal motorcycles, dragging their spinning wheels across the faces of enemy demons, ripping loose skin and meat. Capcom’s latest entry in the beloved action series is silly, raucous, and spectacular — and yet surprisingly consistent, juggling gobs of ideas but never losing focus.The story of Devil May Cry 5 builds upon its predecessors, with our heroes once again fighting demon lords through a setting that falls somewhere between Dante’s Divine Comedy and a Grim Reaper mural airbrushed onto the side of a 1976 Dodge Tradesman. In this entry, half-demon demon hunter Dante, the demon-handed Nero, and their cast of sidekicks and supporting characters are back to stop (yet) another demon from taking over the Underworld.Devil May Cry 5’s design leans heavily into the rule of cool. That’s a very particular term that acknowledges the shortcomings and flaws of a piece of pop culture, while also excusing them due to everything else about the experience being badass.  Devil May Cry 5’s reliance on the rule of cool is uncompromising, and I found it grating until about halfway through my 15 hours with the game — when I began to see it for what it is, and found a way to meet it on its own terms. I had to embrace its soundtrack’s guitar shrills, its cast of Iggy Pop wannabes, and a comically byzantine combat system.Once I did, I was able to enjoy this heavy metal album cover come to life. Devil May Cry 5 delivers on its own aesthetic with so much confidence and commitment that it justifies itself, and most of its flaws.I’m more or less new to the series, which may explain why it took a moment to find my way aboard this particular cosmic ride. I understand that Nero returns from Devil May Cry 4 and Dante from many previous entries. The rest of the characters are about what I expected from the series, based on limited time with previous entries. There’s the mysterious and mopey V, with his cane, book of poetry, and wisecracking demon-bird familiar. Nico is the scantily clad, chain-smoking gunsmith who careens around the city in the Devil May Cry mobile office van. As in previous games, Devil May Cry 5 rates my performance not by the number of enemies I kill in each fight, but by how stylishly I’m able to slaughter them. I earn a rating of “dismal” when I flail around and don’t take advantage of my powers. I earn “apocalyptic” after I learn how to time my attacks properly and use more of the moves at my disposal. To earn the coveted S rank, I must kill with my weapon and slay with my style.I fought against this approach for hours, because I kept forgetting that nothing is more important than being cool. To a newcomer, Devil May Cry 5 plays like an over-the-shoulder hack-and-slash game, and that’s how I kept trying to play it. I’d mash buttons when I entered unfamiliar territory. That got me through fights in Devil May Cry 5 well enough, but it didn’t take my low ratings during each battle to show me that I was missing the point. I was playing the game but not getting it. I’m limited by the closed-off arenas of each fight. It’s intentionally of an era gone by, resulting in a pace that, today, feels uneven and jerky. A cutscene is followed by an empty hallway that leads me to another cutscene. I roll my eyes at the flood of new weapons and new moves, and the boss fights in which the enemy is never quite dead enough that fill the game’s third act. But then I take a step back and realize that a game with motorcycle swords isn’t focusing on its own narrative structure. Because who has time for structure when you have motorcycle swords? The fun isn’t in answering why you have swords, but in taking the time to make the absolute most of them.And that’s when it clicks. I’m suddenly 14 years old with $5 in quarters in my pocket, pumping coins into the loudest, flashiest cabinet in the arcade. I stop tripping over the fights and pacing. I’m only given a small space for each fight, but that allows me to focus on each scrimmage as if it were a theatrical space: my weapon my instrument, each hit a note. Hallways and cutscenes provide quiet momentS before I’m asked to build another crescendo of sticky violence. I’m given new weapons and moves not merely because they are more powerful, but because they provide variety that will add greater depth to my show. I start to think of the game itself as an observer for my actions, and I want to make sure it’s having a good time watching how I use the tools I’m given to kick ass in entertaining ways. I want a good rating on this fight, at this moment, more than I want to see what happens next.But buying into the rule of cool doesn’t mean I’m able to ignore all the ways the game stumbles. Devil May Cry 5 is built on the series’ impenetrable lore, which lies in the uncomfortable space between baffling and inconsequential. I control a trio of brooding men while largely objectified women sit on the sidelines. I navigate plot twists that don’t mean anything to me unless I dig through fan wikis. The default control scheme also frustrated me during the game’s early hours, and I spent too much time fighting the tricky button combinations and earning dismal ratings during battles before I realized I should just take the time to remap the buttons. Once I did get comfortable with the controls and spent some time learning the moves, the fights became almost too easy. Low-level enemies dropped dead before I got a chance to do anything cool, and more difficult enemies barely touched me. I suppose difficulty isn’t the point, since I’m only worried about style. Now, as I work through harder difficulty settings, I find that enough practice and a focus on stylistic combos make most fights quick. The enemies are more like a halfpipe I can use to try cool tricks, rather than a threat that can take me out if I’m not paying attention. And here I find myself, once again, learning to meet the game on its own terms.Devil May Cry 5 is truly, madly, deeply itself. I can’t think of any other game in which I can slice through flying demons while my panther familiar transforms into a spinning wheel of bladed death as metal guitar licks screech across rain-soaked streets. I’m not interested in perfection in that situation; I’m interested in fun. And Devil May Cry 5 is fun. It’s all about huge swords, epic fights, and ridiculous characters. Nothing about the game is subtle. It doesn’t have to be. It’s a gory, metalcore-driven, imperfect romp. It didn’t ask me for much — just 15 hours of my time and a willingness to admit that, all right, dragging a motorcycle across a demon’s face is, in fact, pretty badass. Devil May Cry 5 will be released March 8 on PlayStation 4, Windows PC, and Xbox One. The game was reviewed on Xbox One using a final “retail” download code provided by Capcom.

Devil May Cry 5,Heather Alexandra,Kotaku,https://kotaku.com/devil-may-cry-5-the-kotaku-review-1833077591,"Devil May Cry 5 is a wild mess of demonic magic, blood, brooding twinks, butt rock music, kung-fu homage, and joyous gameplay. By the end of it, I had killed literally thousands of demons and watched struggles of Biblical proportions. The experience itself is a blur, but I know two things for certain. The first is that while there’s nary a drop of romance in the game, every one of Devil May Cry 5’s sexy trash protagonists has absolutely fucked. The second is that every bone-splintering, blood-splattering moment I spent with them was a goddamn blast.This piece was first published on March 6, 2019. We’re bumping it today for the game’s release.Set after Devil May Cry 4, Devil May Cry 5’s story focuses on a massive demonic invasion led by a nasty-looking demon king named Urizen. Guided by series newcomer V, legendary demon hunter Dante and his erstwhile bud Nero square off against Urizen, only to face an astounding defeat at the start of the game. Nero survives, while Dante goes missing. Some time later, Nero embarks on a journey to set right was went wrong and save the world. The journey takes him through a monster-ravaged city and up to the top of a massive demonic tree. Each step forward involves a lot of hacking and slashing of bug creatures and shadow beasts.There is an initial learning curve as the player is introduced to all of the violent options at their disposal. Players can slash enemies to bits, blow them up with rocket launchers, and capoeira kick demons silly.  Once you get the hang of it, though, Devil May Cry 5 builds into the stylish carnage that the series is famous for. The joy of a character action game, be it Devil May Cry, Metal Gear Rising, or Bayonetta, is learning how to make hacking and head-stomping as graceful as a dance. Devil May Cry 5 is a subtle waltz where missing a button press by even a half-beat can have dire consequences. The allure of Devil May Cry isn’t simply the chance to play as a deadly demon hunter; it’s a chance to feel completely in control of your body. Devil May Cry 5 delivers even more by letting its protagonists’ personalities shine through in combat. When I play as these characters, I understand exactly the type of people they are.Nero is angry. Not simply in that tough-guy, video game protagonist sort of way—he’s pissed off. Brushed off as “dead weight” by Dante during their ill-fated fight and reeling from the tragic loss of his right arm months before the game’s start, Nero has a lot to prove. Playing as Nero means channelling his frustration and loss into combat against any demon who wanders into your path. Nero’s sword can be revved like a motorcycle throttle to build up energy before attacking or to give your strikes some extra pop, Gunblade style. He also comes equipped with a variety of prosthetic arms crafted by the nerdy mechanic Nico, a new character to the series. The most basic of these releases a powerful lightning blast, but others have more dramatic effects. You find arms that let you slam enemies around like a pro-wrestler, charge up to release energy beams, propel you through the air, and fire off rocket fists that attack enemies on their own. If you want to kick ass as Nero, you need to lean into every one of these tricks. Here’s how a fight might go:Rush in with a lunging stab, slash and then pause a half second before slashing again to trigger a furious series of overhead strikes. Do a rising slash to launch an enemy into the air, pull yourself to them with your grappling arm, punch them with your rocket fist, shoot them with your revolver to air juggle them, call your rocket arm back to you and ride that shit like a hoverboard. Glide that fist right into a demon’s throat and trigger an explosion. Leap away, dash to the next monster. Repeat until the room is full of bug meat and blood smears. Pause the game and smoke a cigarette because you’re a sexy bitch. If you’re a sexy enough bitch, Devil May Cry 5 will let you know. Like previous series’ entries, each moment of gameplay is accompanied by a letter ranking to let you know what degree of badass you are. It starts at D for “dismal” and builds to the wonderful SSS rating for “Smokin’ Sexy Style!” Variety is the spice of life, according to Devil May Cry 5: The more you kill and the more you switch up how you’re killing, the more your rank increases. This means that the initial portions of the game can feel limiting, as you barely have access to the various sword combos, special moves, and tricky dodge skills necessary to earn those higher ranks. It can be frustrating at first, but as you play and earn orbs to purchase new abilities, the game world transforms from a paint-by-numbers kiddy book to a blank canvas where you are the master. As your rank increases, the game’s musical theme, “Devil Trigger,” begins to play. “Devil Trigger” is not a good song, but God help me if I don’t lose my shit every time I nail a combo and hear its gnashing butt rock wailings punctuate my carnage. Nero is not the only character at your disposal. Much of the early game is spent playing as the mysterious newcomer V, whose frail body leaves him dependent on a swarm of animal familiars to deal with enemies until he can strike a finishing blow. Where Nero is angry and furious, V is slow and deliberate. In a series where aggression is everything, V flips that dynamic upside down.Playing as V sometimes feels more like navigating a map of Into the Breach or fitting a Tetris block into the right place than it does Devil May Cry. Because he’s so fragile and slow in combat, positioning is incredibly important. If I’m playing as Nero, I know exactly where I need to be: right in a demon’s stupid face. As V, that’s more complicated. Combat as V is a combination of dashing and floating into the right position and then summoning the correct minion to punish greedy enemies. Not only does this help communicate something about V as a character—he is distant, reserved, and calculating—but it also brings variety to Devil May Cry 5’s missions. A wild stretch as Nero ebbs into a slower, counter-attack focused exhibition whenever you play as V. Both are equally satisfying, and both force you to think about enemy monsters in different lights. In rare cases, some missions give you the choice of playing as Nero or V. Not only does this offer replayability, but their diverging paths round out the gameplay experience.It wouldn’t be a Devil May Cry game without Dante, and Devil May Cry 5 delivers the most freewheeling version of him to date. Dante has picked up dozens of weapons and fighting styles throughout years of demon slaying. Instead of forcing players to relearn his abilities or contriving some video-gamey scenario where Dante needs to regain his lost power, Devil May Cry 5 gives you access to everything immediately. To quote my coworker Tim Rogers, Dante is “a whole buffet table which happens to have some macaroni and cheese.” Not only does he have access to his signature sword and pistols, he also has gauntlets for kung-fu punching and a motorcycle to crash into enemies. He unlocks even more weapons throughout the story, such as transforming nunchaku and a cowboy hat that can be used as a projectile. All of these weapons can be augmented with one of four stances—Trickster, Gunslinger, Swordmaster, and Royal Guard. Each style gives weapons a different effect, and you’re able to mix a match all of the tools on the fly. It’s wild, stylish, and deliciously excessive.""Jackpot!""Monster MashFantastic combat, stylish cutscenes, each playable character feels unique. Also: it's just fuckin' fun.Story doesn't really take off until the very end, some generic environments in the middle segments.CapcomXbox One (played), Playstation 4, PCMarch 8Completed on normal difficulty in around 14 hours. Repeated a lot of levels to get higher ranks.Tons of melee weapons and guns, all augmented depending on your stance, might sound overwhelming. If I want to turn my magic nunchucks into a Sun Wukong staff, I need to remember to be in Swordmaster. If I want to counter enemies I need to time a block perfectly in Royal Guard. Oh shit, that demon is running right at me. What do I do? But let me tell you a  secret: I played a fair portion of this game buzzed on wine and still managed to get mostly S ranks during missions, at least on the default difficulty. Because for all of the complexity of Devil May Cry 5’s combat, the gameplay is incredibly intuitive. After a little bit of practice and a few mistakes, you start to find what works for you. In my case, that meant falling back on Swordmaster’s ability to unlock new forms and attacks for my favorite weapons while swapping my arsenal around just enough to build up my score. Nero and V have their own particularities, but Dante’s status as Master of Everything means that you’re bound to find a play-style that turns demons into hamburger. Since Devil May Cry 5 makes swapping weapons and styles as easy as a quick button tap, you’ll start to dash around the screen like you were born for this.  The core of Devil May Cry 5 is style over substance, fake it until you make it. Get your high scores, and if you mess up, just load the level again until you get those sweet S ranks.Combat is intuitive, and the characters are clearly defined, but the surrounding pieces that make the experience stumble, if only slightly. The core gameplay is wonderful, but it’s in service of a plot that is fractured and honestly makes little sense, even to a fan of the series like me.Much of this has to do with how poorly some things are communicated. At least one major character reveal was undersold so much that I didn’t even realize what had happened until I read about it again at a loading screen. The core concept is strong: Dante and the gang lost, and now it’s time to pick up the pieces. Character motivations are clear, but there’s not a lot of time spent on really understanding their relationships with each other. Key series characters like Trish and Lady are essentially left in the wings while the protagonists battle a generic demon villain with little charisma. Things finally come to a head near the end, but the process is so rushed that even the most elaborate and badass moments of fan-service land clumsily. Everything is stylish enough in the moment that I was enthralled. It’s only looking back that I realized that not a whole lot had happened in terms of raw plot or valuable character growth.It’s tempting to say that the Devil May Cry series doesn’t need too much plot or interpersonal struggle. To an extent, that’s true. Even with this flaw, Devil May Cry 5 is an amazing ride. But games like Devil May Cry 3 and even the much maligned Ninja Theory reboot DmC: Devil May Cry found time to build out their worlds and bring richness to their characters. In the former, the baroque setting became a stage for a pseudo-Shakespearean tale of clashing siblings and patricide. In the latter, a They Live inspired aesthetic mocking cable news networks turned Dante into a sort of counter-cultural icon. Devil May Cry 5 takes bits and pieces from these games, crafting a setting that’s alternatively neon-lit and steeped in blood, but for all of the flash there’s not as much going on with its characters as I’d like until the final moments, even if the actors sell the shit out of the proceedings throughout.Devil May Cry 5 is a firework. If you’re the one with the lighter, then setting the explosion off is as simple as flicking your finger. If you’re watching someone else, it’s more than enough to enjoy the bright colors and noise. Players looking to get dazzled will find themselves spellbound, while those who dig deeper will find a rewarding and expressive combat system. It’s a little superficial, but that comes with the territory. And while Devil May Cry 5 doesn’t completely redefine the series, it hones the gameplay to a sharp edge that will please diehards and newbies alike."
Devil May Cry 5,Mike Williams,USgamer,https://www.usgamer.net/articles/devil-may-cry-5-review,"Stylish action games are all about lightning-fast combat. It’s a genre where your moveset is so broad that it only reveals its true depth over multiple playthroughs. Devil May Cry 5 is one of the most technical yet. Rather than having just one character to master, here we have three. Newcomer V is weak and attacks with spectral animals called familiars. The twist is that V has to personally finish each enemy off, meaning he must get in and out of range constantly - he’s only effective when an enemy is staggered. Those familiars - which are partly controlled by AI - can be knocked out of action temporarily, too, causing the grotesque hordes to focus on you. You have to constantly keep V out of danger: a horizontal dodge causes you to skate along the ground with your panther familiar, Shadow; while dodging backwards summons your bird, Griffon, to fly you to safety. Not only does the timing of these affect V, but they cause your familiars to disengage. Knowing when to pull them out is key. V is all about spatial awareness, keeping an eye on health meters, enemy locations, spotting clusters for area of effect opportunities, and charging up your Devil Trigger gauge by reading poetry (yes). Get the gauge to at least three bars and you can summon Nightmare, a colossal familiar that bursts through scenery and autonomously fills the scene with explosions and laserbeams. Conjuring this massive creature instantly revives Griffon and Shadow, so timing is paramount.  
 
Though he’s the most complicated on paper (you’re essentially controlling three things at once), V feels built for newcomers. There’s some nuance in how you can charge up one familiar while moving out of danger and hammering attack with another, but he’s the easiest character to parse. Racking up those SSS ranks is a doddle - especially when you learn to chain together finishers, teleporting between enemies and driving your magical cane into their hides. The moody newcomer is fun to play for a while, but his lack of depth makes him the weakest of the roster. His familiars can also be a little frustrating, since you never have full control over their range and they don’t always do what you intend. Things are much better when it comes to Nero. The cocky youngster's moveset seems simple on the surface - one button swings your sword, another fires your gun, and another uses your Devil Breaker: prosthetic arms with varied abilities - but he’s more complex than it appears. You can hold buttons to charge up gunshots, launch enemies into the air, pause between hits to twist into a different combo, rev your sword to Exceed and unlock a fiery new moveset, and pull enemies towards you with a locked-on grab. But it’s in those Devil Breakers where Nero comes into his own. You equip a set of these prosthetics before each battle. There’s a Breaker that grabs and pummels enemies, one blasts out an electric charge, another burrows into demon flesh, one has a rocket-powered punch (which you can also ride), one fires out kinetic blasts, launching you through the air, and there’s another that fires out multiple whips, lashing enemies all around you. Each has its own purpose and ideal scenario for deployment. They also all have a charged technique that overclocks and breaks them once triggered. If you’re hit while a Breaker is active, it breaks, forcing you to equip the next. You can also manually break them to send out a powerful blast, damaging enemies around you - this also works to escape from otherwise unblockable attacks.  
 
The only way to get to the next arm in your inventory is to purposely (or accidentally) break the one you’re using. The idea is that Nero’s moveset constantly evolves as you play. When you want to switch, you have to sacrifice and commit. I can see high level players having a lot of fun with locking down the perfect Devil Breaker setups for each level, knowing exactly when to switch during each encounter. There’s a boss fight early on against a huge demon with a gaping mouth for a belly. In my first playthrough, I barely scrape through. In my second playthrough - on the more difficult Son of Sparda setting - I stagger him by exploding my Devil Breaker, then use the Buster Arm to pick him up by his tail and spin him around, launching him across the arena. It’s hard not to have Nero’s shit-eating grin plastered over your face when you’re lobbing a ten foot demon like a trash bag. Most games become less interesting as you replay them, but DMC 5 only gets better. It wasn’t until my third playthrough that I started really getting the hang of jump cancels, a high-level technique that allows you to stay in the air indefinitely. This is triggered by using a move called Enemy Step to interrupt any animation in the air. It’s one of the best ways to rack up an SSS rank combo, and there’s little more satisfying than picking off enemies by pulling them up into the air one at a time as their friends flail at nothing on the ground below. Some hardcore fans have been bemoaning the lack of ‘inertia’ - an unintended mechanic that allowed for more aerial showboating, a side-effect of DMC 4’s physics - but who cares when you can flow from a jump cancel straight into a rocket ride and back again? Despite the nuances of these two characters, though, it’s no accident that the game gives you control of series staple Dante last. The demon hunter is like a Swiss army knife where every attachment is secretly another, smaller Swiss army knife. He’s more versatile than duct tape. He has four fighting styles, and by the end of the game has four melee weapons and four ranged weapons. All of the weapons interact with the styles, and you can switch between styles and weapons with the tap of a button. To complicate things further, some of the weapons have multiple forms.  
 
Take the Balrog, Dante’s demonic gauntlets: pulling back on the left stick and pressing attack at the same time switches it between Kick Mode and Blow Mode, allowing him to flow from capoeira-style kicks to boxer-style punches in an instant. Hitting Circle while in the Swordmaster fighting style deploys a different move depending on whether you’re punching or kicking. You can also hold attack while in Blow Mode to trigger the Welter Move, allowing you to bob and weave, following up with powerful body hooks and uppercuts like a demonic Mike Tyson. While Dante is just as devastating in the air as Nero, he offers plenty of reasons for you to stay on the ground as well. Pair Welter Move with Trickster - a fighting style for swift escapes - and you can dodge, weave, and zip around the arena like a kid at a soft play centre. Use it with Royalguard and you can make up for mistimed dodges with blocks and counter attacks. Whatever firearm you have equipped is layered over this, as well as the ability to switch to Gunslinger to alter the abilities of your ranged attacks. Oh, and you can turn into two different demon forms based on two separate power gauges, with one charging the other. It’s ridiculous, but it somehow remains intuitive and never feels overwhelming. Capcom is a master of the genre it spawned. There’s an element of learning combos and button inputs, but that’s not really the focus - DMC 5 is about making split-second decisions constantly, reacting on the fly to breakneck encounters. None of the moves are over-complicated - the complexity comes from knowing how to stitch them together effectively. Techniques are often a case of pausing attack strings or flicking the stick at the right time. When you’re focused, it’s like you’re being controlled by some unseeable puppeteer. It’s intoxicating. It looks incredible in motion, too. Even with the online components that see other players fighting in the distance at parallel points in the story, the action doesn’t slow down. It’s as slick and smooth as a stylish action game should be. The animations sell it even more, from the way Dante and Nero slide across the floor to turn on a dime, to how V strokes the orbs of his downed familiars if you stand closeby.  
 
The only thing that lets down the presentation are the environments. Everything looks sharp - this is the RE Engine, after all - but the environments are dull. Broken city streets soon make way to dank sewers, and most of the second half of the game is spent roaming the identical corridors and hexagonal arenas of a demonic nest. Some of the secret missions, unlocked by lining up symbols in the scenery, are just as unimaginative. Collect all the red orbs in a library? No thanks, I’d rather be battering demons with this nunchaku that turns into a lightning staff. Likewise, the story doesn’t go anywhere interesting. It’s pure fan service. The series’ returning women - Trish and Lady - play simple bit parts (and also show you their bits and parts). They’re around for the beginning of the game, they disappear for story reasons, then turn up again later - completely naked - for other story reasons. Lady’s real name is Mary, but the moniker Dante bestowed on her is fitting here: she doesn’t really have a personality, she’s just a woman for boys to ogle. Same for Trish, a demon warrior reduced to flesh. It’s a dated depiction of women characters and doesn’t do justice to these previously playable badasses at all. By playthrough two, though, you’ll be skipping the cutscenes to get to the good stuff: that action. Like previous DMC games, this is designed to be played through multiple times. Difficulty in games is often wielded like a badge of honour. In DMC, it’s baked into the design. Whatever difficulty you start on (Devil Hunter here), you keep all your upgrades for the next playthrough. So while the enemies get more difficult, your characters grow stronger in tandem. 
 
Son of Sparda mode, unlocked at completion, is not just about giving enemies more health and letting them hit harder. Instead, it changes up the mix of enemies, throwing different variations at you earlier on and keeping you on your toes. Increasing the challenge really lets you see what you've learned and it keeps the combat interesting through subsequent runs. Though it’s not without its flaws, DMC 5 is a game where action is king. A layperson might think God of War and DMC 5 exist in the same genre, but they don’t. DMC 5 isn’t about going on an epic journey, meeting characters, and uncovering the mysteries of a world. It’s about riding a fucking rocket, flying it between enemies, flipping over a demon and shooting it in the head. It’s about pulling up your hood, taunting the hordes of Hell, and somersaulting sideways at the last second before launching into a flurry of sword strikes. It’s about murdering ten demons without your feet ever touching the ground. It’s about fighting and looking cool while you do it. In that, it’s an unparalleled success. Version tested: PlayStation 4.

DEVIL MAY CRY 5 isn’t hiding how much it wants you back. The unwarranted catastrophe surrounding DmC Devil May Cry pushed Capcom to stop trying to reinvent its stagnating franchise and continue down the path it was already going down. Change-averse fans demanded an “out with the new, in with the old” approach and Capcom obliged with Devil May Cry 5. While the game does stick too closely to its aging roots and doesn’t push forward as much as it should, it still has a solid enough base in most regards to maintain a decent portion of its signature glory.Fast-paced combat made Devil May Cry what it is and it appropriately takes center stage in Devil May Cry 5. Responsive controls ensure that sliding around and slashing about is inherently satisfying; a feat that is carried by its rock-solid framerate. Each Devil May Cry game’s enemy design, boss fights, and array of weapons or mechanics benefit from that framework and their collective merit is what separates the best installments games from the not so good ones. And while that can mostly be summed up easily in those past entries, Devil May Cry 5’s three different characters vary drastically in quality and make that judgment a bit more difficult than it has been in the past.V is the newest addition to the Devil May Cry pantheon and, frankly, the weakest of the whole lot. He only strikes his opponents to land the finishing blow and relies upon his demonic panther, bird, and monster to do his attacking for him, which is unlike anything else in the genre. Novelty, however, can’t make up for how distant and unsatisfying he is to play most of the time.Commanding forces lacks the tactile feeling of attacking someone for yourself, which is a key part of any good hack and slash game. The projections also don’t always instantly obey your commands, further separating you from the action you already take a backseat to. Hanging back and sending orders means attacks can easily whiff since your lackeys will have a hard time judging if they should zoom in to the enemy you’re locked on to or pummel the bush 10 feet in from of it. V’s gameplay almost plays out like a real-time strategy game yet that approach doesn’t channel what Devil May Cry is good at and it shows.Precision has always defined Devil May Cry and V just doesn’t stack up. The game oddly doesn’t punish brainless play as evidenced by how effective button mashing is, even on the harder Son of Sparta difficulty. It struggles to effectively stop the player from exploiting thoughtless methods as randomly and continually attacking charitably hands out S ranks and destroys most bosses. He lacks nuance yet the game almost never demands it from him; a failure on two fronts. It’s not outright bad as it skates by on the core fluidity of the base controls, creative attack animations, and one-on-one boss fights but its mindlessness goes against everything Devil May Cry stands for.Nero’s mechanics are more in line with what Devil May Cry is about and, more specifically, Devil May Cry 4. Many of his attack strings carry over unabated, giving him a comparable, gratifying gameplay loop that is admittedly a bit sparse when compared to Dante’s arsenal. However, a few late-game upgrades and slightly bigger ability pool improve his overall playability this time around despite still being limited by just a single sword and gun.His new Devil Breaker arms are supposed to be the most substantial new addition. Instead of just grabbing enemies with a demonic hand, there are multiple different hands each with a unique standard and ultimate attack. For example, there’s one that stops time in a small area normally and stops time everywhere when charged up. But what the multiple Devil Breakers have in variety is almost overwritten by a few puzzling design decisions.Devil Breakers are, well, breakable and will shatter when you take damage, use its ultimate attack, or detonate it to push back enemies. Most of their strategic functions get undercut by how limited they are and how you can’t easily switch between them. Burning any arm on low-level enemies is a tough proposition since you either have to buy or find replacements. Scarcity like this discourages experimentation; a feeling that runs counter to the strengths of the genre.And you can’t switch between the arms in your loadout which is limiting given the endless possibilities swapping Devil Breakers mid-combo would have. Placing broken arms on cooldown timers and letting players change between them on the fly would help the Devil Breaker mechanic reach its full capability. The current system is solid on the surface but it only shows tantalizing glimpses of what it could have been.Dante is the only character that fulfills his potential and is unsurprisingly the best part of Devil May Cry 5. While he originally appears to a disappointing carbon copy of his Devil May Cry 4 appearance, the game piles an incredible amount of weapons and moves on the red-coated smartass. Dante’s impressive melee and ranged arsenal combines with his multiple returning styles to give him an overwhelming amount of options.There’s a lot to unpack and the well-paced drip of new toys makes combat an ever-evolving onion that opens up the more you peel back. Each weapon is independently viable thanks to their expansive movesets and overall fluidity. But the game’s freeform approach to combat begs for players to think of clever ways to combine each and create some legendary, rewarding combos. It appropriately takes a lot of practice and dexterity to perform lengthy, uninterrupted juggles, but the game allows you that freedom and the snappy controls to achieve such a status.Dante, V, and Nero all benefit from the game’s incredible replayability. Even though it can cause the early levels to feel like a bit of a slog, the number of purchasable upgrades and new moves come out at a steady enough clip to always give players something to strive for. And the game has enough upgrades to dole out over multiple playthroughs, which is perfect for its approach to difficulty.While the normal setting isn’t nearly as hard as its predecessors, the tougher modes get a bit more challenging as stronger enemies appear earlier on and more resilient bosses execute new patterns. Remixing the core content like this livens up the game since it gives players a new look on what is essentially the same experience. And this steady increase in difficulty is set up in a way to train players for the punishment that lies in the game’s extreme modes that hack and slash games are often judged by. Devil May Cry 5 not only has the responsive mechanics to survive under that duress, but it also is paced cleverly enough to prepare players for those trials if they put in the effort.Even though the replayability represents Devil May Cry at its peak, it still doesn’t overwrite how safe is and how little it has learned from other games as well as its underappreciated reboot. Most environments are flat, cliché locales that fail to match the liveliness or ingenuity of DmC’s memorable stages. Grabbing enemies doesn’t cover as much distance as it should nor does it allow you to pull yourself to your enemies. Aside from the moves in Dante’s Trickster style, dodging isn’t just one button and air dashing is still frustratingly not an option. Platforming is also still an afterthought and most bosses, while exhilarating, don’t tie into the narrative and are random beasts you kill just for the sake of it.While DmC was melodramatically crucified for its take on the series, it did improve the franchise’s aging formula in a few ways that the subsequent entries should have incorporated going forward. Devil May Cry 4’s aging foundation was the reason Capcom handed it off in the first place and to completely ignore DmC’s advancements is as petty as it is unwise. Instead of being a healthy mix of the two, Devil May Cry 5 has chosen to spitefully walk the path of its numbered entries with few modernizations in fear of poking the beehive once again.Its narrative also appears as though it was partially constructed with this timid development plan but that’s not the biggest of its problems. The game abruptly begins and it takes a bit to explain itself, but it turns out that a demon named Urizen is trying to harvest blood through the hellish Qliphoth tree to produce a fruit that yields incredible power to the being that eats it. V, Dante, and Nero take it upon themselves to power up and stop this seemingly unstoppable force.It’s told out of chronological order but easy to follow thanks to the helpful timeline on the loading screens. However, that doesn’t always make it enjoyable to follow as almost every single character is an annoying chud that clogs up every scene with a barrage of unfunny quips. Nero’s newfound snark is a pale imitation of Dante and their merchant, Nico, repeatedly forces horrible jokes in almost every line.V is cringe personified as his regular poetry slams are edgelord nonsense delivered in the most insufferable tone. Griffon, V’s bird, also has a ton of repetitive barks and awful one-liners that sound like a bad impression of Nolan North trying to do an even worse impression of Gilbert Gottfried. Dante is still the same wise ass but, since it is his schtick, he gets away with it. The incredible and simply stunning character animation makes each mesmerizing to watch but no amount of great animation can make most of the cast more tolerable.Even though its plot twists are incredibly obvious because of how overtly the game drops hints, those later revelations make up the game’s best narrative bits. It does borrow some of the conflicts from the past installments but they are just different enough to avoid being a direct copy.But there are bigger issues with the storytelling as a whole. Rather than dish out a narrative evenly throughout each level like DmC, stages are just plot-free strings of arenas with a couple of cutscenes at the bookends. By returning that poorly paced formula, it shows how little Capcom learned from Ninja Theory’s storytelling expertise.Learning little from DmC might be all some disgruntled fans need to hear because the insufferable backlash to that reboot is what has shaped Devil May Cry 5 into what it is. Whether willing or not, it pressured Capcom into reverting back into its old habits and creating a more direct sequel to Devil May Cry 4. While this means it has archaic narrative habits, lifeless level design, and missing features, it also means the game has excellent combat, extraordinary replay value, spectacular boss fights, and one of the best versions of Dante to date. Its reluctance to properly evolve keep it from being the king of its genre, but its commitment to its stylish and responsive mechanics still makes it one of the best hack and slash games, crown or not.GameRevolution reviewed Devil May Cry 5 on Xbox One with a copy provided by the publisher.8Michael Leri is ComingSoon's Senior Gaming Editor.

Devil May Cry 5,Chris Carter,Destructoid,https://www.destructoid.com/review-devil-may-cry-5-544271.phtml,"darkI’ll never forget a conversation one of our readers had with someone who was down on Devil May Cry 5 after the reveal. Their response to another community member who felt burned by DmC: “Mate, there’s a giant monster eating cars with his chest in the trailer, the game is going to be fine.”How right they were.Devil May Cry 5 (PC, PS4, Xbox One [reviewed on an Xbox One X])
Developer: Capcom
Publisher: Capcom
Released: March 8, 2019
MSRP: $59.99Devil May Cry 3 is still the gold standard for action games and I’ll take a moment to tell you why.Coming off the ill-fated Devil May Cry 2 and saddled with directorial duties after the original seat was jettisoned, Hideaki Itsuno had something to prove. He went all-out for the third entry, packing in so many different concepts that it was almost overwhelming yet ultimately satisfying once you figured them all out. The pacing was succinct, the prequel conceit allowed the team to play around with previously conceived notions of the series, and at launch, it was one of the most challenging action games ever released (it was later revealed that originally in the West, the default difficulty setting of “normal” was actually Japan’s “hard”). It was the perfect storm for an action entry that in my mind, has only been approached by the Bayonetta series.DMC3 was seemingly the apex of action and Itsuno couldn’t top it with his next effort. Although Devil May Cry 4 was on point mechanically, knocking it out of the park with two different characters, it suffered from an uneven campaign with tons of backtracking. Devil May Cry 5 feels like a genuine response to those complaints alongside a sprinkling of the secret sauce that made the third entry so great, topped with a hearty helping of original work. Even the menu sounds at the very start (like the “boom…Devil May Cry” voiceover) help set the tone.A tone, mind, that’s familiar, but welcome: a demonic force is terrorizing the world and a group of demon hunters needs to stop it. It’s straightforward and basically serves as a device to thrust the entire gang (Dante, Nero, Trish, Lady, plus newcomers Nico and V) into the spotlight to take down a big bad. With trademark comedic elements and absurd style baked-in it feels authentic, like you’re along for the ride. Devil May Cry 5 is just as over-the-top as the series has always been without taking itself too seriously: it’s the most obvious virtue that’s been put by the wayside in the past. New players shouldn’t feel lost, either. Not only are the four preceding core stories relatively easy to explain, but there’s also a text-crawl “history of the series” movie to watch from the main menu. Let me be clear though: if you’re expecting anything mind-blowing or genre-defining, you might not need to get on this train. This is an old school-minded Bayonetta-esque action romp that doesn’t pretend to be anything more.Your chief tritagonist is Nero from Devil May Cry 4 with some newly minted gimmicks. In lieu of his now-missing arm he can utilize “Devil Breakers,” clever transitory junker items that are so fragile, they’ll break on a moment’s notice. They’re so cheaply made that they’ll disintegrate if you use their ultimate power, use them to break away from an enemy combo or grab, or get hit once while wielding their power (Punch Line, a rocket fist that kind of flies around and does its own thing, is my favorite). To make up for the fact that you’ll be arm-free after they’ve all been ground into dust, Nero also sports a pulley system for grabbing smaller enemies or propelling himself closer to big ones.All of these abilities do a better job of keeping players in the fight than his Devil May Cry 4 kit. Nero really came into his own after I slammed an enemy into a wall then quickly grappled them back and drilled them into the ground. Where I started to click with Nero is when I realized that his Devil Breakers are completely expendable. There’s no point in holding onto them once you’ve mastered dodging: just keep the sparks flying. Nero’s enhanced focus feels more justified this time around.Then there’s the Adam Driver-ass V. He might look like a total dullard, but his wisecracking talking bird rules and so does his whole combat vibe. His whole thing is that his minions (a ranged bird, a melee panther, and a giant behemoth governed by his super meter) beat up enemies for him then he finishes them off with his magical cane. I dig it! You can control your creatures while doing other actions with V, like initiating a more pronounced shadow dodge or reading poetry (seriously) to recharge his super (Devil Trigger) gauge.That same gauge can power-up minions in an “EX” fashion if a certain strategy is favorable, which allows you to manually adapt as you survey the battleground as a commander of sorts. His summons have combos and multi-directional abilities, so you aren’t just spamming them or letting them fight. There’s nothing like surfing a dark nimbus cloud to get around while you’re independently operating your minion bird to shoot projectiles.As for Dante, all four of his styles (the speed-oriented Trickster, melee-centric Swordsman, ranged Gunslinger, and defense-minded Royal Guard) return and are hot-swappable, but this time with new weapons in tow. Cavaliere, the motorbike found in nearly all of the trailers, is actually a set of twin chainsaw blades: combined with the Swordsman style, he can ride it into the fray and grind up enemies. Another, a cowboy-themed power which I won’t spoil here, is one of the most unique in the Devil May Cry universe. From a series that once conceptualized Pandora’s Box as a briefcase full of endless weapons, the weaponry is right on the money.Dante’s styles really are the focus though because once again the swap technique works flawlessly. One moment you might be twirling around shotguns to keep away a mob, then swap to swordsman to isolate a big threat, then in half a second throttle to Royal Guard to perfectly parry an attack, throw back the force of the blow, then use Trickster to dart away and flow back into combat with a teleport.V and Dante (which have their own skill trees) were game-changers for me in the sense that they took Devil May Cry 5 to the next level, marrying new and old-school trains of thought respectively. All of this is present while trying to master Devil May Cry‘s combo system (which goes all the way up to SSS-Stylish, unlocking more intense music as you go), a kind of minigame on top of mere survival. This is a series that boasts a taunt button simply for boosting your score: not something you see often. The stylish focus is partly why Devil May Cry is still relevant.Enemy variety quickly gets spicy. At first you’ll do battle with some nasty bugs, then duel with grim reapers with thorny crowns then hooded dual-cleaver berserkers. Bosses are memorable and formidable, and several are seared in my memory with the best of them. Devil May Cry 5‘s environments are equally impressive and the RE Engine serves the series well. In some cases floors can fall out, leading to new zones, and there’s some really expansive areas where you can see battles going on in the background. It’s the kind of game that makes a commanding use of its photo mode.Backtracking from DMC4 is eschewed in favor of different perspectives for several levels, which are thankfully optional for completion (read: stages where you can choose a character only need to be beaten once, which is rad). Load times are relatively short and pacing is on point from minute one. There isn’t a lot of boring exposition and pretty much everyone gets their ass kicked by the main villain right away (who doesn’t even bother to get off his throne), without an overwhelming sense of “having to power up” for ages to take him on again; more like a general drive and purpose propelling the narrative.My complaints are few and far between, and one of them is complicated. There’s a very brief (like, several minutes if you know what you’re doing) “boss rush” type level with three encounters. At first I was flabbergasted at its customary inclusion, but after figuring it out I made short work of it and accepted how it slots into the big picture. Then there’s the Red Orbs (which you use to buy everything, from items to abilities to revives, on top of the traditional “extra life” Gold Orbs). Remember when it was announced that Capcom was monetizing the game’s currency? This is that discussion.In short, you can buy Red Orbs in bulk, even at the time of death to revive. It’s weird, in an “Xbox One launch” type of way back when it was considered new and didn’t even fly then. Now if you hate the mere thought of them even being included, you can skip out, I won’t be offended. But for the rest of you who are wondering if they impact natural advancement, I’d say “no.” Not once did I feel like I wasn’t earning enough orbs to buy what I wanted and progression felt roughly on par with the rest of the series. If you want absolutely every ability (including some of the endgame ones) you’ll need to go through the campaign at least twice across two different difficulty settings: that hasn’t changed.After the campaign is done you get to keep all your skills across all three characters, plus one extra endgame power that completely changes the way one of them plays. I started working my way through Son of Sparda (hard) as soon as the curtains fell without any sort of fatigue (those optional character levels are suited for replays). There’s also plenty of secrets to locate (including inventive ones with tricks like blowing up walls with V’s Devil Trigger minion) and extra difficulties. Dual-audio is being patched in at launch and the classic Bloody Palace mode (challenge rooms) arrives next month. It feels complete.I’m going to be playing Devil May Cry 5 weeks from now in the short term and years from now long term. This is the sort of fine-tuned wacky action game the genre deserves.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]Flawless10s aren't perfect, since nothing is, but they come as close as you could get in a given genre. The new leader to beat in its sector, we're talking pure ecstasy.

Devil May Cry 5,Brian Mazique,Forbes,https://www.forbes.com/sites/games/2019/03/11/devil-may-cry-5-review-beautiful-action-packed-but-missing-its-heart/#7abb3194f38e,"DMC 5 - CapcomI go way back with the Devil May Cry series. My wife (girlfriend at the time) and I inadvertently began a tradition in 2001 when the original was released. She would sit and watch me play through games and she'd follow along as if it was a movie. She was the first and only girl I'd ever dated who would get into gaming with me on that level.That's one of the many reasons I married her the following year. Because of that experience, I've been excited whenever a new DMC is released, and the release of DMC 5 was no different. My takeaway is mostly positive, but not entirely what I hoped to get from the game.DMC 5 is beautiful on your screen or monitor. If you're playing in 4K, you will be treated to some of the most impressive action sequences, and they're all dancing on the screen with pristine clarity. The visual fidelity is in every aspect of the graphics package. The character's outfits, tattoos, hair, weapons and the plethora of explosions are beautifully rendered.DMC 5I don't think it's overstating the positive to suggest DMC 5 might be the most attractive action game I've seen. While the graphics are an obvious plus, there is a small issue with the visual experience. The camera can be a bit awkward. Depending on what part of the screen you're on, you can get lost in the chaos, or even made invisible behind a stationary object.This isn't nearly enough to make me down on the look of the game. If anything, it's most frustrating because I want to see more of this stellar amalgamation of lighting effects, gore, textures and Japanese anime-like action sequences.DMC 5I wish the sound was nearly impeccable like the visuals. In battle, the action is somewhat augmented by a soundtrack that fits the identity of the game and series. However, the speech from the characters amidst battles come off as mumbles in the more intense fights. There are some odd soundtrack choices in some areas too. Namely, on the DMC van where you upgrade weapons, the music is out of place, and it's hard not to notice.DMC 5Lastly, the dialog from the characters during the cutscenes is disjointed. V is one of the more annoying characters I've seen in an action game. I don't understand why he mumbles almost every word. While his weapons and magical powers are great, his speech comes off like a character who is supposed to have depth but is unaware that he exists in the video game equivalent of a B-movie. It's like Christian Bale's Batman interpretation abandoned the character and became enamored with Marilyn Manson, and now he's stuck in some sort of odd purgatory between the two personas.Unfortunately, everyone who isn't a demon is represented similarly disillusioned throughout the story.This deficiency spills over into the story. This just isn't a compelling journey. As a matter of fact, I actually had to fight sleepiness while watching the cutscenes. Part of the problem is the poorly delivered dialog, but beyond that the story is shallow.You're essentially charged with rescuing Dante, the original hero in the story. Dante appears to have been defeated by a demon and he's disappeared. Nero is the first controllable character. He's supposed to be hellbent on finding Dante, but the passion and determination aren't conveyed.V's mysteriousness is supposed to be compelling. You're supposed to be driven by unlocking his motives, but instead, I didn't really care. My desire to finish DMC 5 was entirely based on wanting to see the various bosses–because they're great–and just to say that I completed the game.The saving grace for DMC 5–beyond the visuals–is the pure action. DMC has always been a hack-and-slash masterclass and this version is no different. The variation of the characters and their unique weapons deliver a good bit of diversity. Each is fun to control in their own right. Also, it's a challenge to learn and acquire the different techniques attached to each character.You start to appreciate all of the differences, and it all works to establish a complete gameplay experience. It's hard to look for more from core gameplay than what Capcom provides in DMC 5.There is an element of microtransactions present, but it isn't a pay-to-win concept. You're consistently prompted to buy red orbs. You can get 100,000 for $1.99. The red orbs are used to buy combos, weapons or to continue when you've been killed. That sounds a little worse than it is considering there are a ton of red orbs throughout the game.You truly don't have to buy them. The combos aren't necessary to defeat any of the demons or villains you encounter, and from normal play, you'll attain the requisite orbs to continue even when you've succumbed to a boss. It's proof that not all microtransactions are created equally.The Bottom LineDMC 5 is beautifully rendered and the action is fun. However, the weak story and less-than-compelling character development and audio presentation remove the game's heart. Instead of being a masterful and complete action game, it's instead far more shallow than it could have been.Platforms: PS4, Xbox One (version reviewed), and PCRelease Date: March 8, 2019Price: $59.99 Score: 7.25/10 "
Devil May Cry 5,Brittany Vincent,Shacknews,https://www.shacknews.com/article/110283/devil-may-cry-5-review-the-devil-you-know,"New to Shacknews? Signup for a Free AccountAlready have an account? Login NowDevil May Cry returns for an explosive entry that delivers on plot, gore, and humor in ways that elevate the series beyond what it's accomplished before. It's been over a decade since the last core entry in the Devil May Cry series, with Devil May Cry 4 introducing players to a new character in 2008. Teenage Nero and his ""Devil Bringer"" arm initially presented series faithful with frustrations similar to that of Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, which introduced the then-new character Raiden.When fans found they were playing as Nero over Dante, at least for a good portion of the game, it was a bit of a shock, but critics and players alike ended up finding that they loved what he brought to the table. The game was ultimately a promising new direction for the series, and heralded great things for Devil May Cry as a whole.But then, after a brief pit stop with Ninja Theory's DmC: Devil May Cry reboot in 2013, there was nothing but radio silence for six years. Enter Devil May Cry 5, the first proper sequel to the core Devil May Cry continuity and the first new Devil May Cry game on current-get consoles like Xbox One and PlayStation 4. Bringing Nero, series mainstay Dante, and new character V together for an explosive combination of stylish action and lore expansion, it's the best the franchise has to offer so far by a country mile.As previously stated, this is a continuation of Devil May Cry 4, and continue the story it does. The story kicks off where an unknown man named ""V"" heads to the Devil May Cry office proper to enlist Dante to help him clear out a series of demon attacks taking place around the world. Dante pairs up with companions Lady and Trish to tackle V's little demon problem and soon realizes he may be no match for the powerful demon who needs slaying, named Urizen.As Dante and the others are swatted down like flies, Nero takes his shot as well, realizing he's no match for Urizen. As Urizen grows stronger and more powerful, Dante, Nero, and the newcomer V must work to take down the demon before the demonic tree he's growing through the nourishment of human blood can continue to flourish.That's the story in a nutshell – barring all the surprises that happen between the opening moments and the final wrap-up that results in the return of a fan-favorite character (by way of someone who's not who they appear to be) and something of a Goku and Vegeta-type rivalry between massively powerful beings. Suffice it to say, without spoiling anything, it's the most shocking end to a Devil May Cry game we've seen in the past, but it's full of good surprises, especially if you've been waiting for some sort of evolution of your favorite half-demons for quite some time. There may even be another joining the family, but mum's the word here.With that in mind, this is very much a story for those who have completed the entirety of the Devil May Cry series (excepting DmC: Devil May Cry) from start to finish. It culls from lore throughout the entire of the games, such as Dante and his brother Vergil, their father Mundus, the origins of Trish and Lady, and how Nero came to receive his demonic arm. You'll want to have at least played through some of the games or be familiar with the lore if you want to take this entry on. Devil May Cry 5 finds Nero back in the saddle again, though he's essentially armless this time around. His demonic Devil Bringer has been stolen, unceremoniously ripped away from his body, and he's forced to use prosthetics if he has any hope of destroying the droves of enemies that plague Red Grave City. He's a demon hunter with his own demon agency, lovingly referred to as Devil May Cry (with support from Dante, of course).It's not like he's using a plastic, hollow arm, though. He has tons of awesome arms called Devil Breakers, built for him by friend and engineer Nico, the granddaughter of the woman who created Dante's iconic handguns Ebony and Ivory. Devil Breakers run the gamut from what appears to be a white plastic arm with a back and forth motion (hinted at as"" good for Nero's girlfriend Kyrie,"" wink wink), a literal fork, and even Mega Man's iconic Mega Buster, with several others to choose from. With that in mind, the game's all about clearing a room or corridor full of enemies, collecting orbs (health, Devil Trigger energy, currency to purchase things) and then doing it all over again in a new area. Unlike the earlier entries, it's bereft of puzzles, placing the spotlight squarely on killing all the demons that you need to eliminate to progress. And that's fine by me, because I've never booted up a Devil May Cry game to solve puzzles. I want to cleave through demon flesh.And DMC5 does it with such panache that it feels like a celebration. It's ultra-stylish (as your performance is graded, of course) and feels fantastic, to the point where you enjoy fighting just as much as dashing through each level hacking through caches of red orbs and occasionally sticking nasty little ""booger babies"" (nidhoggs) into roots to open up areas. It's so enjoyable that I don't mind being interrupted going from point A to point B every few minutes to kill off various species of bad guys because it's so damn fun. Most of the fun stems from the different kinds of combat you can work with. Each Devil Breaker can be used multiple times until it breaks, or discharged immediately to cause a bigger blast and do more damage. Then, the next one in your magazine is ready to use. So if you select a few of your favorites to use, you can burn through them at your leisure as you cut through the hordes of demons.Unfortunately, though you can choose your loadout at the beginning of a mission, you cannot swap between your Devil Breakers at will. You must instead break the current one you have equipped to use the next one. This results in you having to be selective about which works best for you. Do you opt for the Punch Line which can fire rocket-powered left hooks or Helter Skelter, which features spinning blades? You might want to wear the Mega Buster (available with the Deluxe Edition I reviewed) for kicks. Since you have to find the arms out in the world if you don't buy the ones you want between levels, you'll deal with random ones instead. It's nothing to complain about, but something to keep in mind.V is an intriguing character to play as, because he doesn't actually lift a finger to fight himself. It may be unconventional, but it does add something of a refreshing and almost comical element to the story. He can summon the birdlike and panther demons Griffon and Shadow to aid him in battle instead. They simply do all the fighting for him, but V has to strike the final blow with his cane.As V, you need to stand back away from the action, occasionally using V's ""quick step"" to be pulled through the air by Griffon away from enemies so you can dash right up to them again and end their miserable lives. Instead of a Devil Trigger, V can summon the massive creature Nightmare, who's around for a short time and can make short work of enemies. V can read from the grimiore he carris around with him to charge up his Devil Trigger gauge for additional juice so you can keep trotting Nightmare out. While I enjoyed this fighting style, I couldn't help but wish there was additional variety, and there's that undeniable urge to want to be up close and personal with the action – but given the story reasons for V's weakness, I understood why that was the case. It does add a challenging layer to the game that we haven't seen before, however. And with any other weapon, we might have figured out V's secret sooner.Though Nero is undoubtedly the ""star"" of the game considering he's integral to the story, it's Dante who steals the show in terms of combat. This is the big Demon Hunter, the son of Sparda, it's freakin' Dante. Of course he's going to deliver with the big guns. And deliver he does, with his famous guns, shotgun, sword, uh...motorcycles, and the all-powerful Devil Trigger. It's even new and improved later on in the game with a souped-up version of the ability that absolutely wrecks everything in your path, making some of the later encounters a cinch. But Dante has it all, to the point where playing with him feels almost like cheating because he's so powerful. The man can wield motorcycles and beat demons to death with them by using two halves of one as blades. Come on.You won't switch off between the characters every level, but you do it every few chapters or so. Some will let you choose who you want to play as first, though you'll have to go back and do the other levels later as the others. This allows you to absorb more of whoever becomes your favorite, because you'll undoubtedly have one between the wildly varying play styles of Nero, Dante, and V.When you finish the game, you do have several goodies to look forward to. One such is Son of Sparda mode, a higher difficulty level that will whip you into shape. You can also browse character models, items you've collected, and look back on all the secret missions you partook in throughout the game. If you're feeling particularly creative, you can go back into the game and make good use of Photo Mode, which you can do no matter if you've beaten the game or not, but with access to all the levels at your disposal, you can go through and take some seriously impressive shots. It doesn't have all the same niceties of games like God of War or Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, but it can make for some awesome photos. There is co-op play, but only in the broadest sense of the word. Because I played ahead of the game's official release, I rarely experienced many sightings like this, but at certain intervals when all three characters cross paths, you may potentially run into the ""ghost data"" of other players. You might look off of a ledge and see them fighting demons while you're doing the same thing across the way. It never happened to me, likely due to a lack of player data, but they could even theoretically fight alongside you when it makes sense in certain areas.This will ramp up more when the game is out and everyone can play it, but it's a cool feature. At the end of a mission where another player makes a cameo, you can rate their performance as ""stylish"" or not, and if you end up receiving positive ratings yourself, you'll be rewarded with things like Gold Orbs. I would have vastly preferred traditional co-op play, but this made things interesting, and I felt like I needed to put on my best performance so others would rate me positively and I'd rack up the items. Plus, I wanted to look cool in front of my peers, of course. Devil May Cry 5 is an excellent action game. It's an even better Devil May Cry, perhaps the best the series has seen just yet. It's aesthetically pleasing in ways I never thought possible for the series, and chock-full of love for the fans, oozing out of every pore. From the throwback naming of demons that hearken back to the earlier days of the franchise to the style that drips out of every orifice, this is the best that Devil May Cry gets and more. Some fans may find the open-ended conclusion a bit frustrating, but I found it the perfect way to start laying groundwork for additional titles in the future. And judging by this game's quality? We're going to need them sooner rather than later. Trust me on this. This review is based on a PlayStation 4 download code provided by the publisher. Devil May Cry 5 will be available on March 8 via retail and digital stores on Xbox One and PlayStation 4.

					Brittany Vincent posted a new article, Devil May Cry 5 review: The devil you know 
					The only DMC I ever played was Ninja Theory's DmC: Devil May Cry. I had no idea it was a reboot but I thoroughly enjoyed it. If this new one is anything like it I will check it out.				
					[deleted]				
					Nice! Damn this also sounds amazing My Body is Ready! I am all pre-ordered up for my PC(pray it works in triple screen config on the PC for that would be insane!).  I personally fell in love with it during the XB1 demo so to read this review makes me Ultra Mega Hyped :) . The style, art, gameplay, sound, vibe is so Japan game design and I freaking love that(was what I was hoping for in the next DMC title), it just feels so right/has soul. That was my impression from just the demo, it is DMC done right and what it should progress to and what it should be. So happy right now, Brittany you made my day :) , thanks for the write up. Tomorrow is going to be an Epic day.				
					Review is as cool as the 5th installment of DMC. Nice!  Capcom is really going all out.  They've been introducing some of the best remakes of their most popular game series such as Resident Evil 2 and Megaman 11.  I can't help but have a strong feeling that Devil May Cry 5 will be the best game in the DMC series.  I love how I still get to see Nero and Dante.  I'm excited for the new protagonist as well.				
					This game should he held as an example to other developers of how to do a PC port.  It has better setting options than Metro, but a mile.  Also the HDR is amazing in this game which is nice to see given the mediocre implementation in the re2 remake.  				"
Devil May Cry 5,Kirk McKeand,VG247,https://www.vg247.com/2019/03/06/devil-may-cry-5-review/,"Stylish action games are all about lightning-fast combat. It’s a genre where your moveset is so broad that it only reveals its true depth over multiple playthroughs. Devil May Cry 5 is one of the most technical yet. Rather than having just one character to master, here we have three. Newcomer V is weak and attacks with spectral animals called familiars. The twist is that V has to personally finish each enemy off, meaning he must get in and out of range constantly - he’s only effective when an enemy is staggered. Those familiars - which are partly controlled by AI - can be knocked out of action temporarily, too, causing the grotesque hordes to focus on you. You have to constantly keep V out of danger: a horizontal dodge causes you to skate along the ground with your panther familiar, Shadow; while dodging backwards summons your bird, Griffon, to fly you to safety. Not only does the timing of these affect V, but they cause your familiars to disengage. Knowing when to pull them out is key. V is all about spatial awareness, keeping an eye on health meters, enemy locations, spotting clusters for area of effect opportunities, and charging up your Devil Trigger gauge by reading poetry (yes). Get the gauge to at least three bars and you can summon Nightmare, a colossal familiar that bursts through scenery and autonomously fills the scene with explosions and laserbeams. Conjuring this massive creature instantly revives Griffon and Shadow, so timing is paramount.  
 
Though he’s the most complicated on paper (you’re essentially controlling three things at once), V feels built for newcomers. There’s some nuance in how you can charge up one familiar while moving out of danger and hammering attack with another, but he’s the easiest character to parse. Racking up those SSS ranks is a doddle - especially when you learn to chain together finishers, teleporting between enemies and driving your magical cane into their hides. The moody newcomer is fun to play for a while, but his lack of depth makes him the weakest of the roster. His familiars can also be a little frustrating, since you never have full control over their range and they don’t always do what you intend. Things are much better when it comes to Nero. The cocky youngster's moveset seems simple on the surface - one button swings your sword, another fires your gun, and another uses your Devil Breaker: prosthetic arms with varied abilities - but he’s more complex than it appears. You can hold buttons to charge up gunshots, launch enemies into the air, pause between hits to twist into a different combo, rev your sword to Exceed and unlock a fiery new moveset, and pull enemies towards you with a locked-on grab. But it’s in those Devil Breakers where Nero comes into his own. You equip a set of these prosthetics before each battle. There’s a Breaker that grabs and pummels enemies, one blasts out an electric charge, another burrows into demon flesh, one has a rocket-powered punch (which you can also ride), one fires out kinetic blasts, launching you through the air, and there’s another that fires out multiple whips, lashing enemies all around you. Each has its own purpose and ideal scenario for deployment. They also all have a charged technique that overclocks and breaks them once triggered. If you’re hit while a Breaker is active, it breaks, forcing you to equip the next. You can also manually break them to send out a powerful blast, damaging enemies around you - this also works to escape from otherwise unblockable attacks.  
 
The only way to get to the next arm in your inventory is to purposely (or accidentally) break the one you’re using. The idea is that Nero’s moveset constantly evolves as you play. When you want to switch, you have to sacrifice and commit. I can see high level players having a lot of fun with locking down the perfect Devil Breaker setups for each level, knowing exactly when to switch during each encounter. There’s a boss fight early on against a huge demon with a gaping mouth for a belly. In my first playthrough, I barely scrape through. In my second playthrough - on the more difficult Son of Sparda setting - I stagger him by exploding my Devil Breaker, then use the Buster Arm to pick him up by his tail and spin him around, launching him across the arena. It’s hard not to have Nero’s shit-eating grin plastered over your face when you’re lobbing a ten foot demon like a trash bag. Most games become less interesting as you replay them, but DMC 5 only gets better. It wasn’t until my third playthrough that I started really getting the hang of jump cancels, a high-level technique that allows you to stay in the air indefinitely. This is triggered by using a move called Enemy Step to interrupt any animation in the air. It’s one of the best ways to rack up an SSS rank combo, and there’s little more satisfying than picking off enemies by pulling them up into the air one at a time as their friends flail at nothing on the ground below. Some hardcore fans have been bemoaning the lack of ‘inertia’ - an unintended mechanic that allowed for more aerial showboating, a side-effect of DMC 4’s physics - but who cares when you can flow from a jump cancel straight into a rocket ride and back again? Despite the nuances of these two characters, though, it’s no accident that the game gives you control of series staple Dante last. The demon hunter is like a Swiss army knife where every attachment is secretly another, smaller Swiss army knife. He’s more versatile than duct tape. He has four fighting styles, and by the end of the game has four melee weapons and four ranged weapons. All of the weapons interact with the styles, and you can switch between styles and weapons with the tap of a button. To complicate things further, some of the weapons have multiple forms.  
 
Take the Balrog, Dante’s demonic gauntlets: pulling back on the left stick and pressing attack at the same time switches it between Kick Mode and Blow Mode, allowing him to flow from capoeira-style kicks to boxer-style punches in an instant. Hitting Circle while in the Swordmaster fighting style deploys a different move depending on whether you’re punching or kicking. You can also hold attack while in Blow Mode to trigger the Welter Move, allowing you to bob and weave, following up with powerful body hooks and uppercuts like a demonic Mike Tyson. While Dante is just as devastating in the air as Nero, he offers plenty of reasons for you to stay on the ground as well. Pair Welter Move with Trickster - a fighting style for swift escapes - and you can dodge, weave, and zip around the arena like a kid at a soft play centre. Use it with Royalguard and you can make up for mistimed dodges with blocks and counter attacks. Whatever firearm you have equipped is layered over this, as well as the ability to switch to Gunslinger to alter the abilities of your ranged attacks. Oh, and you can turn into two different demon forms based on two separate power gauges, with one charging the other. It’s ridiculous, but it somehow remains intuitive and never feels overwhelming. Capcom is a master of the genre it spawned. There’s an element of learning combos and button inputs, but that’s not really the focus - DMC 5 is about making split-second decisions constantly, reacting on the fly to breakneck encounters. None of the moves are over-complicated - the complexity comes from knowing how to stitch them together effectively. Techniques are often a case of pausing attack strings or flicking the stick at the right time. When you’re focused, it’s like you’re being controlled by some unseeable puppeteer. It’s intoxicating. It looks incredible in motion, too. Even with the online components that see other players fighting in the distance at parallel points in the story, the action doesn’t slow down. It’s as slick and smooth as a stylish action game should be. The animations sell it even more, from the way Dante and Nero slide across the floor to turn on a dime, to how V strokes the orbs of his downed familiars if you stand closeby.  
 
The only thing that lets down the presentation are the environments. Everything looks sharp - this is the RE Engine, after all - but the environments are dull. Broken city streets soon make way to dank sewers, and most of the second half of the game is spent roaming the identical corridors and hexagonal arenas of a demonic nest. Some of the secret missions, unlocked by lining up symbols in the scenery, are just as unimaginative. Collect all the red orbs in a library? No thanks, I’d rather be battering demons with this nunchaku that turns into a lightning staff. Likewise, the story doesn’t go anywhere interesting. It’s pure fan service. The series’ returning women - Trish and Lady - play simple bit parts (and also show you their bits and parts). They’re around for the beginning of the game, they disappear for story reasons, then turn up again later - completely naked - for other story reasons. Lady’s real name is Mary, but the moniker Dante bestowed on her is fitting here: she doesn’t really have a personality, she’s just a woman for boys to ogle. Same for Trish, a demon warrior reduced to flesh. It’s a dated depiction of women characters and doesn’t do justice to these previously playable badasses at all. By playthrough two, though, you’ll be skipping the cutscenes to get to the good stuff: that action. Like previous DMC games, this is designed to be played through multiple times. Difficulty in games is often wielded like a badge of honour. In DMC, it’s baked into the design. Whatever difficulty you start on (Devil Hunter here), you keep all your upgrades for the next playthrough. So while the enemies get more difficult, your characters grow stronger in tandem. 
 
Son of Sparda mode, unlocked at completion, is not just about giving enemies more health and letting them hit harder. Instead, it changes up the mix of enemies, throwing different variations at you earlier on and keeping you on your toes. Increasing the challenge really lets you see what you've learned and it keeps the combat interesting through subsequent runs. Though it’s not without its flaws, DMC 5 is a game where action is king. A layperson might think God of War and DMC 5 exist in the same genre, but they don’t. DMC 5 isn’t about going on an epic journey, meeting characters, and uncovering the mysteries of a world. It’s about riding a fucking rocket, flying it between enemies, flipping over a demon and shooting it in the head. It’s about pulling up your hood, taunting the hordes of Hell, and somersaulting sideways at the last second before launching into a flurry of sword strikes. It’s about murdering ten demons without your feet ever touching the ground. It’s about fighting and looking cool while you do it. In that, it’s an unparalleled success. Version tested: PlayStation 4.

Devil May Cry 5,William Schwartz,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/devil-may-cry-v-review/,"When it comes to hack and slash games, there are just a few series that rival Devil May Cry.  The long-running franchise which made its debut on the PlayStation 2 in 2001 has seen six releases over the years taking a weird path to get to Devil May Cry 5.  As fans will recall, the Devil May Cry series was rebooted back in 2013 with the release of DMC.  While that was ultimately a quality title, Capcom announced that they would be making Devil May Cry 5 afterwards.With Devil May Cry 5, Capcom forgets all about the 2013 release and continues the story of the Sons of Sparda from the fourth installment which released all the way back in 2008.  For those that need a refresher, those games focused the main character Dante’s quest to avenge his mother’s death.  Across the series it introduced us to other characters like Virgil, Trish, Lady, Nero, and others. The whole gang returns for a somewhat familiar story in Devil May Cry 5 and there are some newcomers like a weaponsmith named Nico and a mysterious dark character named V.Capcom has been pushing out impressive looking games over the last couple of years with the RE Engine and Devil May Cry 5 is another shining example of great looking content coming from this tech.  Devil May Cry 5 is an impressive visual experience with realistic character models, grotesque enemy models, and gorgeous levels to explore.  In true Devil May Cry fashion it’s all tied together with a pumping metal soundtrack that goes hand in hand with the demon slaying of the game.The point of all of these games in the Devil May Cry series hasn’t simply been to survive long enough to see the credits roll, but to survive in style and play through the numerous difficulty levels on offer.  This is something that Capcom has not gone away from in Devil May Cry 5.  This is still a game that’s about achieving combat ranks with the ultimate goal being SSS rankings in an encounter.  You’ll do this by racking up successive hits on the enemies you are fighting, mixing and matching moves while trying to avoid getting hit.As a hack n slash, Devil May Cry 5 is a deep game that has a steep learning curve and numerous characters to master.  You’ll control Nero, V, and Dante.  Each of these three characters have a unique moveset that is specific to their character.  With Nero you’ll have access to his firearm the “Blue Rose”, his sword the “Red Queen”, and his Devil Breaker prosthetic arms which have a wide variety of functions.  V is entirely different from Nero and Dante.  This character uses a tome and commands three different creatures to attack his enemies.  Dante has a lot of different attacks, but his core abilities are his melee weapons “Rebellion” (and others) , firearms “Ebony and Ivory” , and different style moves.  There’s really a lot to put together when trying to learn these three distinct characters and each one has different strengths and weaknesses.  Playing through the story of Devil May Cry 5.  There will be spots where you can pick your character, and there will be others where you are forced into using a specific character.The combination of this multi-character approach to the game and the great presentation of the game make it feel like one of the best Devil May Cry games to date.  It’s certainly a game that will appeal to fans of the old games, but it does have some new features that are unwelcome.  Devil May Cry 5 has a progression system that will more than likely be divisive.  When it comes to progress in the game, it’s almost all done by purchasing skills and abilities with Red Orbs.  These orbs are found through playing the game, but they can also be purchased for real world cash.The problem with this structure is that you can instantly increase all of your character’s abilities at the beginning of the game if you’re willing to pay.  Worse yet, continuing your game is tied to these Red Orbs as well.   If you want to continue in a particularly hard boss fight you’ll need to use these Red Orbs.  The more orbs you spend the more health and equipment that you’ll be able to continue with.  For me this wasn’t a huge problem but it did feel like I was getting squeezed at different points in the game.  At its worst, this system forced me to replay a level as I got roadblocked in a boss fight that required more than one health bar so I had to go back and earn orbs on another level to progress.  Due to this system, I always had the feeling that I should save the orbs for continues instead of upgrading my character.This system is the most unfortunate thing about Devil May Cry 5 and after seeing the credits roll and needing to actually back track on the game to progress at the point that I mentioned I was still ready to go and do it all again in the Son of Sparda difficulty.  Devil May Cry 5 is a really fun action game that feels like you’re just scratching the surface on it when it comes to mastery after only a single playthrough.  The best games of this type reward you for coming back and Devil May Cry V does that with some unique upgrades at the end game that carry over into your next playthrough.The microtransaction blemish on Devil May Cry 5 is a big one and it’s probably going to be a bigger deal for some more than others.  Regardless of your skill level, its inclusion is one that will, at the very least, have you thinking about your money management in the game.  There is also the very real possibility of a complete progression halt if you run out of orb currency.  That said, despite the questionable monetization tactics, Devil May Cry 5 is an impressive game on the presentation front and a deep hack and slash with a ton of moves, combos, and weapons to master across three unique characters.

Devil May Cry 5,Chris White,God is a Geek,https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/devil-may-cry-5-review/,"March 8, 2019.Style flows through every vein of Devil May Cry 5, never missing an opportunity to steal the breath from your lungs, fusing artistic violence and superlative combat to render you weak at the knees. It’s a staggering accomplishment and a technical marvel, constantly introducing new mechanics that don’t overwhelm you even though they probably should, and keeping a constant 60fps without any issue at all.Picking up several years from where Devil May Cry 4 finished, Nero now has his own demon hunting agency under the banner of Devil May Cry. A brand new character known as V seeks out the help of series legend Dante to combat the widespread attacks of a multitude of demons, leading them all to Red Grave City, and after a powerful demon known as Urizen threatens the world, they must do all they can to defeat him. There’re plenty of throwbacks to previous games, including familiar boss battles and references to past characters, so fans of the franchise will have plenty to smile at.The plot itself is filled with plenty of twists, and the cutscenes that help tether the story together look stunning. The RE Engine is pushed to its limit and it never disappoints. There’re some scenes that feel a bit uneasy when involving the women of the game, and the camera lingers a little too long on their ‘assets’, and at the end of the game I was uncomfortable with a derogatory phrase used to describe them. Besides those moments, the visuals are remarkable, and I enjoyed every single one. The music helps elevate certain scenes as well, fusing dubstep and metal in the finest of ways.The Devil May Cry series has always been known for the way you slaughter countless demons, and DMC5 is no different. Each one of the three characters has a robust move set, always evolving with the opportunity to upgrade them with the Red Orbs you find throughout the game. Nero has something known as a Devil Breaker, which is essentially a prosthetic arm harbouring lots of different abilities. Nico, Nero’s friend and inventor, builds a plethora of them as you progress, giving you abilities allowing you to slow down time, shoot explosives, and punch harder than Mike Tyson in his heyday. You can also use the arm to pull enemies towards you, helping you to keep combos going and earn that ever so pretty SSS style award.Dante has the most diverse set of attacks thanks to the new weapons introduced as you play. Starting off with Ebony and Ivory as well as the Rebellion Sword, you gain the Cavaliere, a motorcycle that moonlights as two huge swords resembling the Lancer in Gears of War, Balrog gauntlets that allow you to punch and kick with glorious aplomb, along with some other magnificent weapons. Not only that, you can change the style of your attacks on the fly. By pressing different directions on the D-pad, you can choose four attacks that aid with speed, defence, a powerful gun attack, and an advanced sword attack. Dante can also use Devil Trigger to turn himself into a demon, allowing him to do huge amounts of damage for a short period of time.V is probably the most interesting of the three, as he technically doesn’t lay a finger on the demons until the end of their life. You control three of your own demons to attack. Griffon is an eagle capable of dishing out ranged electrical attacks, Shadow is a panther that attacks in close range, and Nightmare is a Golem that comes out to play once your Devil Trigger reaches three bars. You can also use the Devil Trigger to apply to Griffon and Shadow, allowing them to do a wealth of damage on their own. Once a red ring appears around a demon, V goes in for the kill with his cane. There are other things V can do while his demons attack, such as reading from his book to increase Devil Trigger, and getting close to Griffon and Shadow to regain their health.There are times when you’re fighting a lot of different demons, and having so many attacks at your disposal helps to earn the highest rank. Incorporating speed, combos, and a variety of attacks will get you the S rank and above. Sometimes there can be so much happening on screen you’d imagine a couple of technical missteps, but there wasn’t a single framerate drop. Even though you can be attacked by many demons at a time, you always have a grasp on it, and as that rank increases you feel like an absolute bad ass. It’s such a treat to play, and I never wanted the thrill ride to end.As I mentioned earlier, there’s a healthy upgrade system, and by spending Red Orbs you can build up your move set, spend them on new Devil Breakers, improve Shadow, Griffon, and Nightmare, and improve all of your weapons. Red Orbs can be carried over between your characters so you don’t always have to spend them solely on the character you’re playing as. I have to say I had the most fun playing when I was Dante, but both Nero and V are excellent to control, and when I had to control them it was never a hardship. Everything about the gameplay is phenomenal, and I haven’t got a bad word for any of it.Throughout Devil May Cry 5, there are a lot of boss fights, and whilst some can be extremely tricky, they make the most of every new trick you’ve learned as well as the environment. You’ll fight demonic legends straight from the annuls of hell, as well as new ones as well. Some are monstrous, some are seductive, some are fast, and some are powerful, but all are challenging and never dull. I can’t praise the design of the bosses enough, and by the end you’ll be overwhelmed by just how incredible they are. Not just the bosses but the demons themselves are diverse, and each one pushes your abilities to the maximum.Devil May Cry 5 is an incredible hack and slash game that plays like a dream. The design of each character is stunning, and the combat is on par with the best that gaming has to offer. The story is over the top and as bombastic as they come, but I wouldn’t have it any other way. Be prepared to fall in love with one of Capcom’s flagship series all over again.Combat is phenomenal
Technically perfect
Visuals are stunning

Devil May Cry 5,Mike Minotti,GamesBeat,https://venturebeat.com/2019/03/06/devil-may-cry-5-review/,"Connect with top gaming leaders in Los Angeles at GamesBeat Summit 2023 this May 22-23. Register here.I would have thought that I’d love any game that has me fighting demons with a motorcycle. I enjoyed Devil May Cry 5, which comes out for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on March 8 (I played on an Xbox One X). But I didn’t love it.Devil May Cry 5 is an action game featuring over-the-top combat. Well, a lot about the game is over-the-top. Most aspects of Devil May Cry 5 — including humor and music — come at you with the force of a battleship broadside. It will bombard you.I think you’ll like it … or at least some of it. Devil May Cry 5 has some weird pacing problems thanks to the way its switches perspectives between three different characters, each with separate abilities and power levels. It’s a fun ride, but it can be jerky and uneven one.Check out our Reviews Vault for past game reviews.GamesBeat Summit 2023Join the GamesBeat community in Los Angeles this May 22-23. You’ll hear from the brightest minds within the gaming industry to share their updates on the latest developments.Flashy fightingMost combat involves using guns and swords to take down demons. Fighting has a great flow to it, with impressive character animations blending the transitions between different attacks.You play as three different characters. Nero uses a sword and a revolver, and he also has a robotic arm that can pull him closer to enemies (or pull them closer to him). Dante has a sword and dual pistols, but he expands his arsenal throughout game, which includes fun and flashy weapons like two motorcycle wheels. These big weapons feel great and heavy when you use them, and you can even combine them together to ride a full motorcycle into enemies.V is the most creative character. He uses demons to fight for him. On the Xbox One, the X button is a ranged raven attack, while the Y button sics a demonic panther on enemies. He can also summon a giant golem as a special move, and this massive creature makes some big entrances.Above: Vroom vroom!Impressive production valuesEven aside from the flashiness of the game, everything looks great. Devil May Cry 5’s characters are surprisingly life-like looking despite existing in such a other-worldly title. And as insane as the combat got, I never lost focus of my character. A responsive camera and clean visuals make it easy to keep track of everything.Cutscenes can also be a lot of fun, featuring fight choreography that would make most Hollywood action movies jealous.Awesome boss fightsMany of the bosses are epic and creative encounters, featuring monsters that can destroy buildings or climb over them as you fight. These encounters are where Devil May Cry 5 gets the most creative. The pure scale is impressive.And just like the playable characters, the bosses have a lot of pretty and over-the-top moves. It’s a lot of fun just to watch their attacks.Above: All demons must die.Uneven pacingDevil May Cry 5 is most difficult at the beginning, when you’re only playing as Nero and trying to figure out things like his grapple hand. As you learn more skills and combos, and become more experienced, you’ll find yourself having an easier time.This is normal for an action game, but switching between multiple characters make the pacing even weirder. I talked about how cool V’s combat looks, but his levels are too easy. V himself doesn’t need to be near combat since his spectral buddies can fight for him. He just needs to move into deal the killing blow on each enemy. But even then, he can teleport to any demon that’s on death’s door. After that, he can just slide right back out of combat and away from danger.When playing as V, you can also just mash the X and Y buttons to make the raven and panther attack at the same time. As stupid as that sounds, it was effective. I would often get a SSS-style ranking during battles, the highest in the game, just by spamming those buttons and having V do his finishing blows. During boss fights as V, my hand began to cramp from all the mashing.Above: Playing as V is visually impressive but too easy.It becomes jarring when, after breezing through a few V levels, you have to play as Nero or Dante and actually worry about finding openings in your enemies’ patterns and doing combos.The game also felt too easy on Devil Hunter, Devil May Cry 5’s normal difficulty. I only died during a few boss fights the entire game, and an overly-generous item called Gold Orbs can bring you back to life with full health even during the middle of a battle. You can buy these at an in-game shop, but you can also find plenty of them just running around levels. I always had more than five, sometimes ten, in my inventory. With that much insurance, I didn’t feel much tension during the game.An obnoxious toneDevil May Cry has always had a “too cool for school” vibe. That can work if you’re actually cool, but Devil May Cry 5 is more often obnoxious. Characters make a lot of quips and jokes, but they just aren’t all that funny. Or they’re just lazy and obvious. When one of our heroes sees a weird monster, they’ll say something like, “I didn’t know it was Halloween.”The tone works better with the music, which includes a heavy metal soundtrack that gets more intense as you’re your style ranking improves. That over-the-top tone works well during gameplay with the crazy fights and chest-bumping music. It doesn’t work as well when character open their mouths during cutscenes.Above: Fighting demons looks pretty.Devil May Cry 5’s combat can be fun and flashy, which is good, since you spend most of your time in the game fighting. But something is missing. For one thing, Devil May Cry 5 doesn’t really have any puzzles. Sure, you may find a locked door, but a key is never far away. Most of the time, it’s in the next room.When all you have is fight after fight, it can get tiring. Devil May Cry 5 tries to remedy this by giving you a constant stream of new characters, abilities, and weapons to try out in combat. But none of it serves as a substitute for a better-paced, most challenging adventure.Devil May Cry 5 won’t be a total disappointment thanks to its stunning production values. Aside from the recent Resident Evil 2 remake, this is the best-looking game Capcom has ever made. Its adventure is a fun one if you don’t take it too seriously (which shouldn’t be too hard). As much as I can gripe about its flaws, it’s hard not to grin when you’re shoving a running motorcycle wheel into a demon’s face. But this isn’t an action classic.Score: 70/100Devil May Cry 5 comes out on March 8 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

Find out more about how we test, analyze, and rate.Living in a day and age when I can actually play Devil May Cry 5 has been a dream since I was 12 years old. And I'm sure that's the case for many DMC fans out there as well. Now, after a long 11 years since Devil May Cry 4, Capcom has finally unleashed the latest installment in its beloved, stylish action series for PS4, Xbox One and PC. And you know what? The company kicked absolute ass.Devil May Cry 5 takes place several years after DMC4, with Dante and Nero working at Devil May Cry as devil hunters for hire. One day, a mysterious man who calls himself ""V"" shows up to hire Dante to take out Urizen, the Demon King. Just before that, Urizen shows up at Nero's garage and rips Nero's Devil Bringer arm clean from his body. This brings the three characters out to Red Grave City, where they team up stop Urizen.Devil May Cry 5’s compellingly chaotic combat drives me to clear all of the ridiculous difficulties that it throws at me.For those unfamiliar with the series, it's akin to legacy God of War and the Ninja Gaiden games. Devil May Cry features third-person swordplay and gunplay built around how stylish you can be in fast-paced, hack-and-slash combat.At the start of the game, the combat can seem a little simplistic, but don't be put off by that. Each character has a ton of purchasable upgrades that I am still working my way through, even now as I start the Son of Sparda run.And there are quite a few boss fights in Devil May Cry 5 that DMC fans will surely adore. One, in particular, was the battle against Cavaliere Angelo, with whom the player can go sword to sword with as Dante, countering the foe's moves with the right timing. The best fights in DMC history are good old-fashioned sword fights.Nero is the vanilla fighter of the group, as he's equipped with a single sword (Red Queen) and gun (Blue Rose) that can dish out a ton of damage. But his gimmick is his Devil Breaker, which can completely change the dynamic of combat.The Devil Breaker is Nero's hot-swappable robot arm, which Nico designed to help combat demons in multiple scenarios. There's one swappable arm that can launch enemies in the air, another that stops time and one that fires out of Nero's forearm socket to repeatedly rocket-punch fools while you're off slicing up some other demons. The Devil Breaker adds a much needed quality to Nero's gameplay.Meanwhile, Dante gets the ultimate service. He has his full style set, including Swordmaster, Gunslinger, Trickster and Royalguard (which changes his B or Circle button inputs), as well as a wide variety of guns and swords that he can switch among for maximum combo potential. On top of that, he has his usual Devil Trigger, in which he takes on a demonic form to regain health and dish out extra damage.My all-time favorite weapon is, of course, Cavaliere, because who doesn't love chopping demons in half with a motorcycle that turns into dual buzz saws? And I wanted to love Dr. Faust (a gun in the form of a hat). But because it consumes red orbs (currency) when firing, I was reluctant to use it. Side note: When Dante obtains Dr. Faust, he straight-up does the moonwalk and then sends off the scene with fireworks, which completed me as a human being.V's gameplay is as weird as his poetry, and it needs a lot more work to be compelling. Not the up-close-and-personal type, V instead commands a set of demons to do his bidding. They are Griffon, Shadow and Nightmare, which are actually callbacks to bosses in the first Devil May Cry. These demons aren't much of a gimmick, however, because they simply act as the gun, sword and Devil Trigger, respectively. Unless you call Griffon babbling about like the parrot Iago from Aladdin a gimmick (even though he is pretty funny).The only thing different about V is that he attacks from long range, and once the enemies are low on heath, he has to finish the job himself. V's gameplay seems to be missing an element, something like Dante's styles or Nero's Devil Breakers, which round out those characters so well.Capcom has done wonders with the RE Engine; I never thought that a Devil May Cry game could look this good.The detail in each character's features crosses over to pure realism, which is a first for DMC. Even the camera's orientation adds to that impression, as it grounds the game in reality and allows a more personal connection to the characters, despite the game's over-the-top nature. One thing that gave me pause, however, was the lip sync. It's fine in some scenes, but in others it gave off a weird, uncanny valley effect.Devil May Cry 5's world still features a gothic structure, but the set design truly brings the world to life, especially in the urban levels. Some things that caught my eye were multiple white chairs and tables sitting outside of a little restaurant, the detailed underside of a car, and posters for upcoming films in the subway. It feels like people actually exist in this world, unlike in the previous titles, where the world was more like a wacky playground for demons.There is a photo mode, which I love using, but it needs some work. As of right now, there are no settings for filters or options to add or remove elements from the shot. It's simply a camera and one that has limited distance at that. It doesn't help that there's a forced DMC5 logo on the bottom left corner either.To top it all off, Devil May Cry 5's excellent soundtrack adds character to all of its stunning visuals. Nero, Dante and V all have their own combat music, and you can even swap out each character's battle track via the Jukebox in the Gallery menu.Devil Trigger has a fast-paced electronic beat mixed with some angelic vocals that convince me I should just replace every battle track with it, but my body compels me to appreciate other works of art as I tear demons in half. Subhuman is the typical heavy metal soundtrack you'd expect to hear while Dante is wracking up stylish combos. Crimson Cloud has more of a tribal, instinctual sound that literally screams at you to ""fight for your life,"" which works well with V's gameplay, as you're meant to avoid physical combat at all costs.Devil May Cry 5's Cameo mode is disappointing. This online multiplayer system is meant to allow other players to show up as one of the three playable characters in areas where it makes sense. However, when the player does show up, as it'll state on the left-hand side of the screen, you're actually just seeing a recording of them.It seems like a wasted effort, especially when Capcom could have put time into making an actual co-op mode. For example, when I attached my Overture Devil Breaker on one of the Angelo enemies, V blasted our foe with lightning, which ignited my Devil Breaker for an epic tag-team combo. It was then that I realized that this game has plenty of opportunities to expand its online options.Devil May Cry 5 is everything a DMC fan could ever want. It's not without its flaws, of course, considering that the ending and V's gameplay both could have been more satisfying. However, it's a whole lot of fun, and it perfects the gameplay that we oh, so cherished from the previous titles.I just hope that more story content arrives to expand upon the excellent scenes that did occur. But for now, we'll have to wait until April to get Bloody Palace Mode, which is a free tournament-style mode featured in previous DMC games.Bam. Review over. Go buy it.

Devil May Cry 5,Matt Cox,"Rock, Paper, Shotgun",https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/03/06/review-devil-may-cry-5/,"Do no armRelease: March 8, 2019
On: Windows
From: Steam
For: £45/$60/€60 There is a demon, and I'm going to kill it. With style. I'll shoot and slash and somersault, chaining together increasingly outlandish combos while listening to electro-metal where I only catch the odd word like 'sword' or 'death'. Every part of this will feel a little bit magical, and I say that as someone who usually listens to hippies sing about flawed modern power structures and the importance of letting people choose their own lifestyles. Such is the spell of Devil May Cry 5.The first thing I did in Devil May Cry The Fifth was watch an optional six minute long backstory cutscene. I've played all of Three and some of Four, and it's not just because that was many years ago that I can barely remember what happened. I don't think the cutscene cleared much up, but I also don't think it needed to. Every Devil May Cry is about a demon that had two babbies, and about how those babbies wind up fighting each other while other demons try to take over the earth. The plot of every game is ridiculous, nonsensical, and full of people that turn into swords. This is no exception, but we've got better things to talk about than the plot.Let's start with those swords, because they are important and numerous, and because one of them is actually two halves of a motorcycle. From hell. Most things in Devil May Cry are from hell.The first sword you get is not a motorcycle, but you can rev its handle to engulf the blade in flame. (Most things in Devil May Cry can be engulfed in flame.) It's wielded by Nero, a blando-angry man who is salty about losing his arm in the last game. He shouldn't be, because he now also has an array of awesome robo-arms that actually overshadow the whole flaming sword deal. We're talking arms that turn into ridable rocket-fists. Arms that fire lasers. Arms that stop time.But gosh, is he angry. You can feel it in every sword swing and robo-punch, every gunshot and snarl. Nero is a man who will skewer three demons in a single dash, stab them half a million times, then knock one of them skywards for a more intimate slicing session. He'll clasp their faces from afar with his his robo-arm (the robo-arm is also a robo-grappling hook), reel them in, and cleave 'em in twain. He'll plug them with revolver shots, soften them up with some more slashing, then ignite his sword mid-combo to wreathe every nearby enemy in fire. He is both faster and furiouser than the cars wot are famous for being so.V is more sedate. He's the second character you play as, an enigmatic poser who looks distractingly similar to Kylo Ren. He has his pet demons do his fighting for him, and you're plonked into his shoes after the first few missions.At first I welcomed the change of pace, but it wasn't long before that pace grew tiresome. He's got a talking bird (very much the Jar Jar of May Cry) who does ranged attacks, a silent panther who swats at things up close, and occasionally a massive golem that either crushes things or makes them explode. It's a novel combat style that too easily dissolves into button mashing. You want to constantly attack with every demon at your disposal, which makes chaining abilities and combos too much of a headache to bother with. Unlike with the other characters, they don't even feel necessary - and I was playing on the harder of the two initial difficulty modes. You do have to teleport in to polish off enemies with V's dainty cane-sword, but for the most part you just hang back while your crow jabbers lightning. It's too passive, and lacks the tension of a close-up brawl. He does get to turn his panther into a shadow puddle that he glides around on outside of fights, though, so I can't complain too much.I also can't complain because it isn't long before you get a choice of who to play, and not long after that before Dante steps up to the plate. Dante. The original devil with permission to sob, and the man with the motorcycle swords. He is far and away the most fun.That's largely due to his massive arsenal. You don't unlock everything at once, but by the end of the game Dante packs three different guns, four melee weapons and a hat that fires XP. One of those melee weapons is a boot/glove combo with separate move sets, catering for fans of both punching and kicking. It would be a lot to deal with even if you weren't also thinking about four different stances, flowing between teleports and blocks and gun-tricks and snazzy sword attacks. Let's not even talk about the charge-up meter that temporarily turns him into a devil. Or the separate meter that turns him into a devilier devil. It's a carnage carousel that's easy to fall off of, a deluge of options that can easily sweep you away. A silly number of upgrades means that past a certain point, whichever buttons you press will make something special happen - though you still need to pay attention. I can't deny Dante's fiddliness, or that I haven't let out Nero-worthy howls as I've accidentally swapped to the wrong weapon. I want that, though. I want the space for mistakes to build towards mastery, for clumsy staccato slashes to turn into elegant dances of death. As with all games devilly and tearful, the punishment for failure isn't necessarily a game-over screen. It's more likely to be a man screaming ""DISMAL"" at you, and a big D slapped on your screen at the end of each fight and mission. Demons will still die if all you do is bumble between basic attacks, but you won't get to feel nearly as smug. If you do actually die, a clever respawn system lets you sacrifice XP for another go, though the cost of using it more than twice in a row is wince-worthy. (Unless you've been playing well enough to earn diamonds, which are tucked away in missions and handed out if you earn an S-rank at the end. Rather more dubiously, you can also buy them with real money, if you so choose. Maybe that merits further discussion, but for now just, like, obviously don't.)I've already chewed through nearly all my word ration, and I've used most of them on talk about the combat being varied and fun. This is fine. In my eyes, if a Devil May Cry game has fun, varied combat, then it has succeeded as a Devil May Cry game. It doesn't hurt that it's also weird, full of surprises, stupendously daft and often laugh out-loud funny - though not always for the intended reasons. The voice acting is hokey as hell, and the story beats absurd. It's all a bit 'go deal with the wibbly thing’, but again, this is fine. Apart from the sexist semi-fridging of two female characters who happen to lose all their clothes before you manage to rescue them. That bit is gross and bad.I've talked a lot about swords, but I should say something about the monsters on the other end of them. They're ghastly from the off, when you have to wade through scuttling hell-beetles mashed up with human flesh. Those are followed by goat-wizards and bone-armadillos, and the flow of fresh horrors rarely lets up. Apart from the many annoying scissor-ghosts and the one dreadful boss fight, they are all an absolute pleasure to stab, shoot, or robo-punch.There was a demon. I've killed it. I'd like to kill some more.You're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!

Devil May Cry 5,Travis Northup,GamingTrend,https://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/a-hell-of-a-ride-devil-may-cry-5-review/,"It’s been more than a decade since Devil May Cry 4, and it’s hard to believe that a franchise so beloved has gone without a follow up for so long. While Ninja Theory’s DmC reboot game attempted to revive the franchise by taking it into a different direction, many fans have been hoping for a return to the original franchise that made the series as staple in the Playstation 2 days. Now, Capcom is finally bringing DMC back with Devil May Cry 5, and after almost 20 hours with the game, I’m happy to report that the wait was well worth it.The events of DMC 5 takes place a few years after those of DMC 4. A mysterious man with a cane named “V,” who looks like an even more emo version of Kylo Ren after a shopping spree at Hot Topic, enters the Devil May Cry office and hires the legendary devil hunter Dante to kill a powerful demon named Urizen. Meanwhile, Nero, an aspiring devil hunter who made his debut in the previous game, hunts demons out of a mobile Devil May Cry office with his enthusiastic friend Nico. As Dante, Nero and V follow the trail of demon attacks that seem related to Urizen’s appearance, their paths once again intertwine as they find the source of the demons and Urizen’s power: a rapidly-growing otherworldly tree called the Qliphoth. The conflict that unfolds thereafter is filled with shocking twists and turns, breathtaking setpieces, badass boss fights, and more stylish demon slaying than any game you’ve ever played.Without going into too many details, DMC 5’s narrative is the best it’s ever been, even giving my beloved DmC (2013) a run for its money. While all three of the playable characters play a hugely consequential role in the overarching story, each also has their own arc, and I found myself surprisingly invested in all three. The sarcastic, wise-cracking Dante serves as a nostalgic centerpiece whose story offers few surprises, but is by far the most entertaining character (and has the best dance moves to boot). The mysterious newcomer V gives players something entirely new, whose story is filled with mystery and hardships. And most impressive of all, Nero’s story manages to complete redeem the lackluster debut he made in DMC 4, and ended up being my favorite of the three by the time the credits rolled.Despite Devil May Cry’s long history of complex narratives, I found DMC 5 surprisingly easy to follow, avoiding the usual pitfalls that many long-running franchises often run into. But that doesn’t mean the game’s storytelling structure is without issues. Like lots of games nowadays, DMC 5 makes use of non-linear storytelling, and like many games before it, DMC 5 sometimes becomes unnecessarily complicated in doing so. Every cutscene is preceded by a date or timestamp to help avoid any confusion about the timeline, which only serves to make the heavy use of non-linear storytelling more irritating. Sometimes the jumps in time are useful tools to obscure an upcoming twist in the story, but other times they’re just pointless sneak peeks of something cool around the horizon that we could have just as well waited to enjoy later on.But of course, in between the epic cutscenes, snarky banter, and unexpected dance numbers, you’ll be kicking the living crap out of demons of all shapes and sizes, and DMC 5’s incredibly complex hack-and-slash combat is better and more chunky than it’s ever been. As Nero, you’ll try out a variety of different mechanical arms and dart around the screen causing mayhem, as V you’ll use your summoned demon pets to weaken targets before stepping in to deal the final blow, and as Dante you’ll pull of insane combos by switching between dozens of combinations of melee weapons, ranged weapons, and battle styles. As with previous entries in the franchise, more important than the obvious goal of winning the fight is doing so with style, and your performance in battle is constantly displayed on the right side of the screen, urging you to reach for even greater heights of badassery every step of the way.And DMC 5 is without a doubt the most stylish game you’ll play this year. Awesome tracks blast in the background as you dance through the air laying waste to the hordes of hell. Enemies assail you with ice, fire, electricity, claws, and teeth, which fills the screen with color and dangerous obstacles. When you finish off a group of enemies, time slows down and the camera pulls in close to highlight your character’s smiling face as the final demon is slain. Every piece of DMC 5 is perfectly tuned to reflect the rebellious, over-the-top, action-packed spirit that has become a hallmark of the franchise, and you can’t help but smile even in its cheesiest moments.Since DMC 5 has three playable characters, by necessity you’ll need to master three entirely different playstyles if you have any aspiration to see the credits roll. The first character you’ll play as is Nero, a badass devil hunter with a robot arm, called a Devil Breaker, that can be swapped out for one of many different versions. As this character, all things revolve around the Devil Breaker. You’ll pull enemies towards you by using your arm as a grappling hook, elect to detonate your limb in order to escape otherwise unavoidable situations, and swap your Devil Breaker out for several different models, each with their own power. One model allows you to temporarily slow down time in a concentrated area, another empowers your attacks with increased lethality, and another allows you to dart around areas with incredibly improved mobility. The sheer options and versatility of the Devil Breaker quickly made Nero my favorite of the pack, and I never go bored of customizing my loadout of lethal appendages.Of course, it wouldn’t be a Devil May Cry game without Dante, and in DMC 5 there are more options for him than there ever have been. You’ll swing a demonic motorcycle at your enemies, become incredibly agile and acrobatic when utilizing your melee fighting style, and even use a demonic cowboy hat to make the minions of hell beg for mercy. In addition, you’re able to switch between a variety of fighting styles that make you better a certain aspects of combat. For example, one fighting style will make your ranged weapons more deadly, while another allows you to perform deadly counter attacks by utilizing a defensive fighting style. Switching between weapons and fighting styles in battle improves your style ranking, encouraging you to make use of your entire arsenal in each fight.Finally, there’s the newcomer V, who is too weak to keep up with the likes of Dante or Nero and instead keeps his distance and allows his demonic pets to do his bidding. Griffin, a demonic eagle, makes use of powerful ranged attacks from the sky. Shadow, a fearsome panther, gets in close to deal deadly melee damage. Then there’s Nightmare, a massive and terrifying golem who smashes everything in her path and unleashes a devastating explosive laser beam. As V, your goal is to avoid getting hit while commanding each of your demonic allies from a distance. While you’re not in any immediate danger, you can choose to read from your satanic book of bad poetry, which fills up your devil trigger meter, but leaves you completely open to attack. Once your allies have done enough damage, you must move in yourself to deal the final blow with your cane. While V’s combat style is certainly more passive than playing as Dante or Nero, it offers a fresh type of gameplay that breaks up some of the repetitiveness.And what’s so awesome about DMC 5’s three excellent playable characters, is that in many levels you decide which you’d prefer to play. Not only does this mean you get to play the character you prefer more often, but also that some levels have three different versions, one for each of the characters, lending some much needed replayability to the game. While I thought I might just choose Dante at every available opportunity, I surprisingly found myself picking Nero or V on occasion just to break up the experience. I cannot stress how great it is that you’re able to make this choice throughout the course of the campaign. Regardless of the mood you’re in, there’s an option for you, and that’s truly awesome.My only complaint where gameplay is concerned is that the hardest difficulty available to you when you first play the game is far too easy to provide any kind of a challenge. I was easily able to get a high level ranking and blow through any enemies before me without a problem, and the very few times I slipped up, I had plenty of revive items that got me back in the fight in no time. While it’s great that they provided a way to brute force your way through the game for players who would rather not repeat sections, it’s a little disappointing that a more challenging experience isn’t available at the start, meaning that players have to get through an entire laughably easy playthrough before they’re able to access more demanding options.In terms of presentation, DMC 5 is a joy for the senses. The game looks absolutely gorgeous, both during gameplay and cutscenes, and has some of the most unique setpieces and colorful designs in recent memory. Similarly, the audio design is stunning, as the game is filled with loud music and violent sound effects that suit the game perfectly. The voice acting is also extremely high quality across the board, even for the game’s weirder characters like Nico. By the end, even the B characters feel like old friends that you’re happy to see on-screen again, and that’s no small feat.Finally, I need to talk about loading screens. When a review mentions loading screens, it’s rarely a positive thing, so it might be weird for me to compliment DMC 5 on its stunning lack of loading screens, but I feel compelled to do so. I was so rarely in a loading screen in the game that at one point it actually seemed bizarre that the game looked and played so well and didn’t have any. Either they did an incredible job at hiding their loading screens with cutscenes, or they performed some satanic ritual that allowed them to make this game immune to them. Either way, this is a nice touch that I’m endlessly grateful for.DMC 5 is probably the best hack-and-slash game you’ll play all year, and definitely the most stylish.—Travis NorthupSee below for our list of partners and affiliates:One of the longest running independent gaming news, reviews and culture sites on the web.The thing that is magical about the Wizarding World isn’t the magic – it’s...by Ron BurkeThe world is going to end.

Devil May Cry 5,Patrick Lum,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/mar/06/devil-may-cry-5-review-a-triumphant-return-to-stylish-demon-slaughter,"PC, Xbox One, PlayStation 4; CapcomHigh-octane challenges in this irresistible romp have resurrected an action series that’s been dormant for over a decadeDespite appearances, this frenetic, over-the-top action game about sexy demon hunters isn’t just another power fantasy. Instead, as you hack your way through the hellish hordes and survive intense battles with single foes of unparalleled ferocity, you’ll realise it’s all about self-improvement, about rising to meet the high-octane challenges before you, and doing it in style. Devil May Cry 5 has the confidence to give you tools, show you your foes, and say: if you think you can do this, then step up and prove it.The combat itself is a spectacle. It looks chaotically hack-and-slash at first glance, but you’ll soon find that to truly be SSStylish, you’ll need to master efficiency, variety, and precision. Reading enemy movements or trapping them in unending combos is of paramount importance, with defensive options relatively strict in their timing; you can’t get by just wildly hammering attacks and trusting your reactions (though there are difficulty-mediating options for first timers).At first it looks like DMC5 – which resurrects an action series that’s been dormant for over a decade – might be a bit too self-referential for newcomers, though in truth “there’s a big demon tree and you need to kill it” is all the plot you really need to know. It’s a fun, pulpy romp, aided by quippy writing, sharp action-movie direction and surprisingly emotive character work courtesy of Capcom’s RE Engine. For those who do remember them, though, the story is packed with callbacks to the older Devil May Cry games (the 2013 DmC reboot is politely ignored, though stylistic influences remain).You might start out feeling overwhelmed, but the difficulty curve is such that it isn’t long before you’re dancing between demons in a single free-flowing combo, bullets flying, sword periodically bursting into flames. Given the dizzying complexity of possible inputs – iconic protagonist Dante can swap guns, melee weapons and combat styles on the fly – it’s astounding how good the game is at training you to play it. Even new character V, who uses summoned beasts in a genre defined by direct, immediate control of your fighter, feels surprisingly agile, fluid, and fun to use.Earlier Devil May Cry games tended towards the cartoonish, but here every enemy is a grotesquely detailed monstrosity, every attack a flurry of glowing, dazzling particles. It all looks extremely pretty, but can also hurt combat readability, especially when you’re trying to come to grips with new foes. A similar issue arises with the level design: every environment, whether grey crumbling ruin or fleshy body-horror landscape, looks so immaculate that it’s occasionally difficult to tell which parts are purely aesthetic and which you can interact with.Beyond the fighting, some of DMC5’s peripheral elements feel bolted on. There’s a multiplayer cameo feature where other players’ fights play out in the background, which is cool but inconsequential, a bare-bones training room, and a gacha-esque shop where you can spend real money on in-game cash (though thankfully you probably won’t really need to). But the core of the game – the style and the substance – is rock-solid.DMC5 is a lot like Dante himself: older, grizzled, more experienced, yet still unapologetically juvenile in the best possible way. It’s bloody, spectacular and irresistible, all cheesy one-liners, guns, swords and explosions while guitars scream in the background, and it plays like a dream. Director Hideaki Itsuno and his team have delivered: Devil May Cry is back.Devil May Cry 5 is out 8 March; £39.99."
Devil May Cry 5,Olivia White,Telegraph,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/features/devil-may-cry-5-review-dante-friends-return-stylish-supremely/,"Dante’s back. The wisecracking devil hunter who’s equally versed in gun- and sword-play. There were fears when Capcom's stylish Devil May Cry series was rebooted in 2013, that we wouldn’t see classic Dante again. But despite the excellence of Ninja Theory's fresh spin on the character, Capcom has decided to return to the original white-haired, red-coated guise in Devil May Cry 5. And what a glorious return it is.The setup is typically wild Devil May Cry fare. A terrifying demonic presence has reared its ugly head, laying waste to the London-inspired Redgrave City, and it’s up to Dante, his cocky nephew Nero and mysterious newcomer V to stop it. The action begins as they engage in confrontation with the big bad, and things get worse from there in all the most entertaining ways.Nero’s introduced as a playable character first and in many respects, it is the youngster's story. Since the events of Devil May Cry 4 he has lost his demonically-powered right arm. But his business partner and prodigious weaponsmith Nico is on hand to create Devil Breaker prosthetics, a diverse collection of fragile robot arms that Nero can utilize in combat.There are a whole bunch of these, with special abilities ranging from energy bursts to rocket launchers to slowing down time or healing Nero. Every arm type has a default grappling hook function that can be used to grab enemies or swing from vantage points, giving Nero’s combat style flexibility and range.All of the Devil Breakers can be self-destructed in an extra powerful attack, and the arm you’re using can’t be manually selected, so there is a depth of strategy that sees you sacrificing arms in destructive ways to switch up your style. And it’s simply one part of Nero’s arsenal and the more you play the more it’s revealed just how in-depth Devil May Cry 5's action is.On top of his Devil Breakers, Nero utilizes a twin-chamber revolver and a sword, both of which can be charged to make their attacks more powerful. There are dozens of special moves and combos to unlock for each of these weapons. Nero functions as a solid all-rounder character, strong as a ranged or up close fighter. And even then, it’s not until you reach the final level for the first time that you get full access to Nero’s abilities, with a significant (and terrific) twist at the end of the game adding further depth to his abilities.Next up is V, and boy is he an interesting and unique character for an action game. V suffers from ailing health and isn’t capable of attacking enemies by himself. Instead, he makes use of three demons who he can summon to aid him in combat; a bird, a panther and a giant one-eyed golem.V is an absolutely fascinating character to play as. You’re in direct control of him in battle, and for the most part you want to keep him out of any enemies’ path. To attack you are able to directly control Griffon (the bird) and Shadow (the panther), firing off ranged attacks with the former and melee strikes with the latter.There is a fascinating juxtaposition of keeping V at a distance but using the lock-on to attack with both demons. If you want to focus on just using one demon, you can set the other to Auto by expending some of your Devil Trigger Gauge (essentially the special move meter you increase by smacking things around). Or you can set both to auto and focus on keeping V safe. You can also choose to build your Devil Trigger Gauge manually by reading from a book of William Blake poetry as V strolls around the battlefield. You can do this even while directly controlling the demons. It is delightfully weird.Build up enough DT Gauge and you can summon Nightmare. He’s a hulking behemoth who lays waste to everything on-screen. By purchasing an upgrade, you can even ride and directly control him, allowing you more tactile access to his destruction.Despite his frailty and the unusual complexity of his combat systems, V is the easiest character to play as. The trade-off between auto and manual attacks means that if you’re not getting to grips with his unique approach then you’re still not going to struggle, but for those who want to delve in a bit more there’s plenty to get your hands on.This approach extends throughout every area of the game; there are multiple difficulty settings, with the easiest being extremely easy. This means players of any skill level can jump in and enjoy, but there is no compromise to the complexity and difficulty the game has to offer for higher tier players. V’s combat design mirrors this most effectively, showcasing the thought that has been applied to each aspect of Devil May Cry 5’s design.Then of course there’s Dante himself. While Nero and V have their own depth and are great fun to play as, Dante is on another level, with his combat options able to fill multiple games alone. On your first playthrough you’ll be unlocking new facets to Dante’s arsenal on almost every level. And when you think you have seen everything he has to offer, a new set of systems are added that offer an entire playthrough’s worth of experimentation.Dante wields Ebony and Ivory, his twin guns, and Rebellion, his sword. But he also has a shotgun and Balrog - a set of gauntlets that turn him into a kung fu master. Balrog offers two unique combat styles, letting Dante focus either on punches or kicks. Just getting to grips with Balrog and its various upgrades could last you for the whole game if you wanted it to.But then you start unlocking other weapons, each one offering an entire moveset and combat style that in many other games would be the full focus. And while this may sound like an overwhelming and intimidating amount of things to learn, it’s entirely in your hands. If you want to play Dante purely using pistols/sword then you can.Capcom's intent is to hand you loads of toys, and loads of systems go with them, and giving you this demon-slaying sandbox to hone your own style and approach. Dante has four styles in total; Trickster, Swordmaster, Gunslinger and Royalguard. Evasion, melee, ranged and defensive. Each of these styles add new movesets to each weapon and you can switch them on the fly. At times it feels like a Combat Choreography Simulator, as you’re chaining together weapons, moves and styles on the fly, creating a bloody and balletic setpiece.Dante has his own Devil Trigger mode too, allowing him to go all demonic. Again adding new movesets to every weapon, and by this point the depth is dizzying in the most enjoyable way. And then you get a whole other modifier for Dante that adds a whole new set of movesets. Narratively it’s a spoiler but mechanically it’s yet more proof that the developers simply want you to have of fun and experiment with Devil May Cry 5 well past your initial playthrough.The whole game seems to showcase developers having a lot of fun. The plot’s silly in the best way. Numerous points are designed to have fans grinning from ear to ear, while newbies will likely appreciate the silliness. It doesn’t take itself at all seriously, except in its combat. Then it’s all business.One thing that may seem jarring at first, however, is the design of levels. They are fairly simplistic, short and very linear. There are a few secrets to find off the beaten track but, for the most part, they consist of corridors leading to arenas leading to more corridors to more arenas. If you just play through the game once from start to finish then, even with all the combat complexity, it might seem a little light on content.But this is not a game designed to be played through once and forgotten. Much like Capcom's brilliant remake of Resident Evil 2, it takes a deliciously old-school approach; challenging its players to work through the increasing difficulties, using its combat arenas to explore various styles and chain together supremely stylish moves to improve your rank each time.The first playthrough feels like a preface, setting you up to have all the abilities needed to tackle the meat of the game. This is evidenced by the fact that both Dante and Nero receive some fairly game-changing abilities right at the end, which then come into their own in subsequent playthroughs.There is a modern twist to all this in the Devil May Cry 5 may well be the kind of game where videos of skilled players rack up scores of views on YouTube. It even has this neat function where, while playing some levels, you can observe another player’s run of a linked level; watching how they performed as one character while you, as another, trek along your own route. It’s a fairly inconsequential addition all told, but it’s pretty cool to know that the Nero fighting away on a bridge below you is showcasing another human player’s abilities.With planned DLC support, including a free Bloody Palace tiered arena mode, there’s no shortage of combat playgrounds to make your own, and even after putting dozens of hours in, you’ll still be discovering new things about how Dante, Nero and V play.It’s stylish. It’s cool. It’s supremely fun, fluid and rewarding. Dante’s back and he’s brought some friends. And with combat flair that makes up the finest pure-action game we have seen in a long time, we hope they stick around."
Devil May Cry 5,Asher Madan,Windows Central,https://www.windowscentral.com/devil-may-cry-5-review,"No offers foundWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.Devil May Cry 5 is the latest installment in the acclaimed franchise and continues the story of characters like Dante and Trish. This time around, the cast is joined by Nero, Nico, and a mysterious individual named V. After V hires Dante to rid himself of a demon king, the botched mission results in a quest for redemption. You take control of a number of characters — each with distinctive playstyles — as you hack and slash your way through the crazy 15 hour-long campaign.As with previous entries in the series, Devil May Cry 5 is also quite linear, but that doesn't mean there isn't a lot to do. There are secrets hidden around every corner, and you can even unlock additional missions by finding hidden pictograms. As expected, gameplay mostly revolves around going from one arena to the next, and fighting a variety of demons. Surprisingly, there's also some puzzle-solving thrown in there to change the pace, and plenty of stylish, action-packed cutscenes to go with it.Devil May Cry 5$60 (opens in new tab)Bottom line: Devil May Cry 5 is a fun game, but Capcom could've done much more to evolve the format.The most striking aspect of Devil May Cry 5 has to be its unbelievable visuals. The game not only runs at native 4K resolution on Xbox One X but also manages to hit a consistent 60 frames per second (FPS). The textures are incredibly detailed, and the animations are natural despite the fact that the combat is otherworldly. Due to its clarity, it's easily among the best-looking games on the console at the moment, even challenging the likes of Red Dead Redemption 2. The new RE Engine is quite powerful, already showcasing its power with experiences like Resident Evil 7: Biohazard and Resident Evil 2, both of which manage to achieve 4K 60 FPS gameplay. While Devil May Cry 5's image quality is pristine, it's unclear if it's using a reconstruction technique to hit native 4K.Devil May Cry 5 runs at 4K 60 FPS on Xbox One XThe creature design in Devil May Cry 5 is also unique and terrifying. Even until the very end, you're presented with new threats that require different strategies. Everything from a simple fly-like demon to a gargantuan lizard is exceptionally detailed. The meticulous attention to detail the developers placed here represents the best of the medium.Music plays an integral part in Devil May Cry 5, too, because the better you do, the more audible and intense it becomes. For example, if you consistently attain a rank of ""C"" or ""D,"" you're going to miss out on the thundering metal soundtrack. However, if you're constantly getting an A or above, the gameplay will feel even more rewarding. I was only able to achieve a ""SSS"" rank a few times, and when I did, the synched tracks made my achievement even sweeter.Devil May Cry 5 offers a few difficulty modes, but if you're new to the series, you should choose ""Human."" It allows the player to execute moves and string together deadly strikes effortlessly. The way to attain a better rank is to chain together a variety of moves using different weapons. After you've familiarized yourself with how that works, you can try ""Devil Hunter"" and go from there. This makes the game much more accessible and should increase its appeal to a wider audience. The Devil May Cry series is known for its challenging gameplay, so long-time fans will be happy that that hasn't changed.While the Devil May Cry franchise isn't known for its stellar storytelling, Devil May Cry 5 offers a compelling narrative with a lot of twists and turns. It starts off in a rather confusing manner, but through a series of flashbacks, the plot is slowly revealed. To its credit, fact that the game makes the effort to represent disabilities as strengths is also commendable.While the voice acting is a little spotty, as the hours go by, the plot intrigue gets better and better, and by the end, you'll be clamoring to see the climax.Whenever I thought of a criticism — aside from the linear corridor-like levels — the next few moments of the game addressed it. For example, if I grew a little tired of fighting in the same corridor, the map would open up a little. If I wanted to see an even more challenging boss fight, the game threw a building-sized fiend at me. It feels as though Devil May Cry 5 expertly knows when its necessary to change up the action.Without giving too much away, the final boss fight is lengthy and is the only one to capture the impossible acrobatics typical of action anime. Have you ever wanted to perform a scene from Bleach or One Punch Man? Oddly enough, Devil May Cry 5 gives you that chance. While the characters change throughout, the intensity remains the same. The clashes are choreographed in such a way that you think it's a battle between gods. I have never witnessed anything like it before, especially when you take into account some of the more wacky weaponry, like Nero's Pasta Breaker. Many titles have come close, but Devil May Cry 5 raises the bar of what's possible in a hack and slash action game.Each playable character — Dante, Nero, and V — have their own set of skills that you can upgrade. There are dozens to choose from, and many have different levels, making them stronger and more versatile. During the campaign, you have to collect Red Orbs which act as currency. While it's quite easy to come across them, Devil May Cry 5 still offers the ability to purchase them with microtransactions. In my opinion, this isn't necessary because you don't need to upgrade all of the skills to do well even in Devil Hunter mode, and you earn so many Red Orbs during every mission that it almost becomes trivial what you choose. If you want to skip to the most powerful abilities at the outset, you can simply by your way there, though.Devil May Cry 5's endless upgrades add new movesAside from the slightly convoluted story and very linear environments, my only other criticism would be that Devil May Cry 5 has abrupt transitions from gameplay to cutscenes. They could've been much smoother. For example, imagine if Nero jumps into a sinkhole and the camera fades to black. The cutscene isn't going to start from the bottom of the sinkhole, but will instead go back and repeat some of the previous motions. On many occasions, the game repeated exactly what I just did a few seconds ago. The editing here could've been much tighter and would've helped with pacing.Lastly, Devil May Cry 5 features questionably exaggerated English voice acting which it could've done without. Luckily, this resolves itself as you approach the end of the campaign, as the plot becomes much more serious. While this is somewhat of a nuisance, it gives Devil May Cry that B-movie feel the series is practically known for.Ever since Capcom launched Resident Evil 7, the company has maintained a stellar track record. Monster Hunter: World was exceptional, and everyone loved the company's new take on Resident Evil 2. Devil May Cry 5 may not be on the same level due to its restrictive environments and inability to break free of the franchise's rigid format, but it's absolutely mind-blowing when it comes to gameplay.Overall, Devil May Cry 5 is a fun game — one that is utterly spectacular — but Capcom could've done more to evolve the franchise's format.Thrilling apocalyptic adventureThis is what happens nextDevil May Cry 5 is a fun game, but Capcom could've done much more.Asher reviewed Devil May Cry 5 on an Xbox One X console using a copy provided by Capcom.Asher Madan handles gaming news for Windows Central.

Devil May Cry 5,Nicholas Leon,Gaming Nexus,https://www.gamingnexus.com/Article/5908/Devil-May-Cry-5/,"Releasing almost eighteen years after the first entry, Devil May Cry 5 comes hacking, slashing, shooting, and generally raising all Hell, literally. Following three protagonists: the enigmatic V, the fiery Nero, and the devilishly charming Dante; the three rogues fight through hordes of external and internal demons to save the world. Combining the aesthetic of Clive Barker and O.G. Hellblazer comics, the game’s setting is dark as much as it is humorous. A fairly lengthy story with plenty of diverse gameplay options including upgrades, secret missions, and hard to find areas, this, unlike a lot of contemporary releases, feels like the developers had a lot more in mind than just how much money they could make off the little, insignificant things, and instead focused on how much the player could get out of the experience, even just the first time around.The game features an eclectic cast of characters, and most thankfully have a personal motivation that goes beyond killing everything that moves. For those who have played more entries in the series than I have, you’ll probably like seeing the old gang of Morrison, Lady, Trish, but for better or worse, it’s the classic Dante and the newcomers V, Nero, and Nico who get most of the spotlight. The three former characters are seen mostly in cinematics, with Morrison popping up at critical times to provide plot exposition, and Lady and Trish literally standing around. It’s an unfortunate aspect that their inclusion is so limited and their characters are given such short shrift.But the amount of character shown in the latter four more than make up for it, each one oozing with their own sense of personality. Nico, a supporting character who plays the dual role of providing character upgrades, is Nero’s support, constantly berating the characters with her unique southern sass. Nero is young and brash, but ultimately has good intentions for those he cares about. Dante, while also having generally well-meaning intentions, seems to be a bit more self-centered, but is also hilarious. V is mysterious, and, if I may say so, Goth as all get out, and that’s why he’s my favorite. In both gameplay and cinematic sections, they each have a chance to truly show what makes them tic, making me all the more invested in who they are and what they want.What impressed me the most about this game is the sheer variety offered across the three playable characters, both in terms of their respective arsenals and fighting styles. The game starts players off with Nero, who has a sword, gun, and a Devil Breaker, essentially a type of robotic arm that has all sorts of functions and different designs. Purchasing upgrades with in-game currency known as Red Orbs (which I just connote jellified blood cells) players can max out Nero’s library of moves in order to get the most dazzling display of blood-soaked swordplay I have seen in a video game. The number of moves can be a little daunting, but there is always some way to perform most of them with ease, as long as you practice. Mostly, I found myself slicing enemies up in the air, then jumping up myself, to slash at them until they were dead, and that was mostly enough to give me solid scores through many fights. But perhaps my favorite moment came when I was fighting a couple enemies, and through some combination of button-mashing, Nero’s Devil Breaker broke off and he rode it like a lethal flying skateboard.Contrast that with V, the second character players get control of, who retains the control of three demons: one melee-focused, the second range-focused, and the third being a power-up. I found V’s fighting style to be preferable, if only because you can direct your attention to more than one enemy onscreen, unlike Nero and Dante. To clarify, V’s range demon, a phoenix with the voice of a knockoff Billy Kristal, can conjure lighting. Combine that with V’s melee-focused demon panther and the power demon, Nightmare, and you’ve got a lot of combat options that make V the most unique character to play as.That leaves Dante, the primary protagonist of the games since the first entry. Although he comes in during the later part of the game, players still get plenty of time with him and his wit. Compared to both Nero and V, Dante’s arsenal is tenfold. Bazookas, a cowboy hat, melee gauntlets, swords, a motorcycle, pistols, a shotgun, and a bo staff that doubles as nunchakus round out his toolkit, as well as four unique styles that players can switch at will. Although Dante’s moveset is just as fun to play with as the other guys, I felt that because his playstyle is so complex that it actually proves a slight detriment. But that’s not to say players can’t grasp it, as each item has their own unique approach, and I can’t help but feel that players are supposed to switch between modes often in order to get the most explosive fights.The amount of enemies to be fought is large, but none of them prove too much of a challenge, at least on Human difficulty, which is what I played on. However, with the introduction of each, the game makes a point of zooming in on them, freeze-framing, and then splashing their name onscreen, each and every time. And it does this not just with enemy types, but also with supplementary items like Blue Orbs, which increase health, or Purple Orbs, which increase the power-up stat. It also doesn’t help that, each time a fight is concluded, the game points it out using a cinematic that shows barriers breaking away, taking control away from the player.In some cases this is helpful, because it may show the needed path ahead or a power-up, but it does this trick every time, and I was tired of it after the first five or so times. It slows down an otherwise fast-paced game, and it is a little annoying.A peeve like that is a small price to pay for the amount of content inside each level. For perfectionists, there are rankings that go all the way up to SSS, for completionists, there are secret missions (I only found the one that the game pointed out to me) and aforementioned Blue and Purple Orbs. There’s a lot here, and it’s nice to know just how much was put in here for the player to enjoy.Besides some issues in pacing and the clear indecision on what to do with certain characters, the only other disagreement I have is a small issue with a particular moment late in the story, but to discuss it would spoil it, and I don’t do that. Suffice to say, there didn’t seem to be a whole lot of personal motivation involved, and it felt as if its sole purpose was to pad out the game’s length.With a reliance on unique and diverse flow of action gameplay and writing that endears players to the characters’ and their story, Devil May Cry 5 is more a blessing. It’s fun, and it brought a smile to my face more than once. That may sound like a one-off comment, but it’s something I find significant when a game can elicit an emotional reaction from me, because it shows that it made me care in more ways than one.  Devil May Cry 5 is frigging great. I think I’ll leave it at that.* The product in this article was sent to us by the developer/company.I am Nicholas Leon. My nickname is Nick, and it all started when I fired up Super Mario 64.

Devil May Cry 5,Andrew Farrell,PC Invasion,https://www.pcinvasion.com/review/devil-may-cry-5-review-almost-a-jackpot/,"It’s been a long, 12-year wait since Devil May Cry 4. After DmC: Devil May Cry enraged the fanbase due to Capcom asking Ninja Theory to design an all-new Dante, I thought chances were good that, if we ever got a new mainline entry, we’d get the Devil May Cry 3 follow-up we’d held out for. While Devil May Cry 5 is certainly a very good game, it takes one of the main elements of DMC 4 that fans were unhappy about and doubles down on it.If you’re a fan of the series, you know exactly who I’m talking about – Nero. When DMC 4 released, it disappointed a lot of fans by seemingly replacing Dante with a new protagonist who had only one set of weapons. Dante himself wasn’t playable until around the game’s midpoint, and his levels saw him going back through Nero’s and fighting the same handful of bosses again. One of the best things about DMC – accruing and switching between new weapons – mostly sits on the back-burner.Once again, Dante doesn’t show up until Devil May Cry 5‘s midpoint. Thankfully, though, he doesn’t backtrack through any of the previous levels. All of the bosses he fights are unique to him, too. However, all but two of his weapons are reiterations of ones from past games. Anyone hoping for the game to be structured like the third game and not the fourth is going to be disappointed. Devil May Cry 5 is definitely more in the vein of the latter, but it’s a definite improvement.At the start of the game, you’re immediately thrust into Nero’s shoes. He’s lost his Devil Bringer arm and now uses a host of mechanical arms called Devil Breakers. Each Devil Breaker has its own unique ability, and there are a lot of them. One lets him fire a rocket punch, one gives him an air dash, and another powers up his sword and gun. In case you’re wondering, yes, Nero still has just the one sword and gun. However, he’s a lot of fun to play as. His Exceed System of powering up his sword also returns, as does his ability to grab foes.
Early on, we’re introduced to a new character known as V. I can only describe him as what I’d imagine Adam Driver would look like if he cosplayed as a Final Fantasy XV character. V is the second playable character, and he has no combat abilities. He fights by commanding three shadow demons while you must keep him out of harm’s way. These demons are Griffin, a bird who mostly handles projectiles; Shadow, a leopard (or panther, maybe) that specializes in melee attacks; and Nightmare, a hulking behemoth V summons with his devil trigger gauge. V is fairly fun to play in his own right, but he’s definitely less engaging than Nero and Dante.Dante is, naturally, the stand-out. I don’t want to give anything away, but there were some things in his missions that gave me exactly what I wanted out of Devil May Cry 5 to begin with. His four styles from DMC 3 all return and work just as you remember. Switching between his different weapons and styles on the fly is still extremely satisfying. His new melee weapon is so ridiculous and over-the-top that I had a great time using it.In case you’re wondering, though: no, you can’t replay missions with whatever character you feel like. I was hoping to play through Nero missions with Dante, but that simply isn’t allowed. I’m hopeful someone will mod it in over the next few months, though. Thankfully, Dante feels much more important and more equal here than in 4. Nero is still the main character, sure, but there’s plenty of Dante to go around.Much like its predecessor, Devil May Cry 5 is also on the easy side. You start the game with easy and normal modes available, and they rarely challenged me. Once you beat the normal mode, you unlock a hard mode that changes up the enemies just like previous games. Nonetheless, the game just doesn’t feel as fast and chaotic as I was hoping for. One thing that I really love about the series is needing to constantly be in motion. DMC 5 just doesn’t quite deliver that level of intensity.Unlike its predecessor, the game has a large amount of bosses. Much like the rest of the game, they’re mostly pretty easy aside from a few outliers. You have to do a couple of them more than once and a couple of them are very obviously meant to be very similar to fights from previous games, which I didn’t mind too much. For the most part they’re definitely really strong and varied boss fights, with a mix of huge behemoths and smaller foes. I wish they were more challenging but I’m satisfied with what the game offers on this front.One thing that surprised me is that Devil May Cry 5 brings back gold orbs and stringent checkpoints. When your character dies during a level (which probably won’t be a common occurrence), you’re given the choice to revive with some of the red orbs you’ve collected, or gold orbs which are hidden in the levels. I think I used maybe two gold orbs during my entire playthrough. Plus, the game still checkpoints before boss battles, so this isn’t nearly as demanding as it initially seems. It’s a fun throwback to previous entries, but it does feel kind of tacked-on.Devil May Cry 5 is the biggest game in the series by a fair margin. My initial playthrough took me 16 hours, and the levels are long and have many things to find. Blue and purple orb fragments are hidden in the levels, as are a dozen secret missions. These secret missions are also fairly difficult to find. I only located half of them during my time with the game, and I missed a fair amount of orb fragments as well, even though I did my best to search the levels as thoroughly as I could.Speaking of which, Devil May Cry 5 gives good incentives to replay levels aside from simply trying to get better rankings. A couple of missions do let you choose between different characters. One of these even has different areas to explore based on the character you picked. Some levels also have branching pathways, so you’ll need to play them more than once to find everything they have. And due to the way the game checkpoints, you can miss a jump that leads to an orb fragment, so you’ll have to start over from the beginning in order to have another shot at collecting it.Devil May Cry 5‘s presentation is a bit of a mixed bag, overall, though. While the graphics are technically very good, with a lot of atmosphere and great use of lighting and effects, the levels themselves are disappointingly bland. You can mostly put them in two camps: ruined cityscapes and large underground insect nest places. The game is also very drab, with a muted color palette and not a lot of interesting sights to see. This also extends to many of the game’s enemies, which are bland insect monsters that aren’t very creative.The story is also problematic, as it plays fast-and-loose with series canon and doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. The basic gist is that the demon king, known only as Urizen, has planted an underworld tree called a Qliphoth that is feeding on people in order to bear fruit. The narrative starts in media res and takes a long time to get going. And even then, the stakes don’t feel high and the world-building is practically non-existent. There’s also another new character, who speaks in an obnoxiously cartoony Southern accent and is kind of a pain every time she’s onscreen. The story has twists, but they’re obvious and there are few surprises. Structurally, it’s reminiscent of Resident Evil 6, though the story itself isn’t even close to being as extremely stupid as that was.Even with these complaints, Devil May Cry 5 is a very good game. The combat, while not as fast or intense as previous games, is still very much DMC combat, which is always fun. The controls are fluid and responsive as usual and the camera rarely gets in the way. There’s a lot of content on offer, and a Bloody Palace mode is coming in April. I enjoyed my time with the game and am going to continue playing it, but I can’t help but be disappointed by how close it sticks to 4‘s formula.Nero’s fun to play as and perfectly okay, but I hope we get a game focused more heavily on giving one character a ton of depth and a steady flow of new weapons. Ultimately, while DMC 5 panders to exactly what fans want in some areas, it simultaneously goes out of its way to not give them what they want in others. Perhaps one day the series will focus on what it does best. For now, though, I’m glad DMC is back, and I’m glad it’s better than DMC 4.Devil May Cry 5 might not be the best entry in the series, but it's a good time with great gameplay, in spite of the middling story and bland art direction.About Us

Over the last few weeks, games like Far Cry: New Dawn and ANTHEM have left us numb. Somewhat enjoyable, but ultimately, totally disposable experiences. Devil May Cry 5 is an intense reminder of what games can achieve when they have crystal clear focus. It's a linear, highly replayable action game that pulls no punches, and as soon as we tore through our very first demonic enemy, we haven't wanted to play anything else.Capcom has crafted something remarkable here. In terms of pure action and resulting spectacle, Devil May Cry 5 comes scarily close to embarrassing the competition. The combat has a depth to it that you won't find outside of fighting games, and in true series fashion, dispatching your foes with style requires knowledge of the many tools at your disposal. What we're trying to say is that this is Devil May Cry back to its absolute best -- it's an adrenaline-pumping thrill ride from start to finish.There are three playable characters and each one of them is a joy to take into battle. Devil May Cry 4's Nero has lost his long silver locks along with his right arm, replacing the latter with a robotic limb known as the 'devil breaker'. In part, Nero's gameplay revolves around his new toy, with each devil breaker bringing a different technique to the battlefield. Devil breakers can, ironically, break, and coupled with his reckless swordsmanship, Nero's emotional personality is mirrored by his rough and ready fighting style.In contrast, newcomer V likes to sit back and oversee combat from afar. Using his pet demons as his weapons, V's gameplay relies almost entirely on commanding these bestial entities, ideally from a safe distance. It's a fresh and uniquely brilliant deviation from the usual up-close-and-personal scrapping that the series has always known, and it's really just another feather in the cap for Capcom's supremely talented combat designers.Last but certainly not least, Dante is back with a range of weapons that he can swap between in the blink of an eye. The legendary demon hunter oozes confidence and finesse as he changes fighting styles on the fly, all while correcting combos and pulling off some ridiculously cool attacks. After playing as Nero and V, Dante's numerous abilities open your mind to just how involved Devil May Cry 5's combat system can be if you really want to push it.And that's the genius thing: you don't have to push it. The learning curve in Devil May Cry 5 is excellently judged, and there are two base difficulty levels: Human and Devil Hunter. There's no denying that the game provides a hardcore action experience, full of do-or-die situations and incredible boss battles that'll make you sweat, but if you're new to the franchise or just want to soak up the story and atmosphere without too much hassle, the Human difficulty is a great place to start. What's more, there's an automatic combo system that you can toggle at any point, allowing everyone to get in on the action. Even with the assists the title still has its tricky moments, but this is probably the most accessible Devil May Cry yet, and it allows for all of this without sacrificing anything that veterans have come to expect.Simply put, this is a masterfully designed release, and the pacing is absolutely on-point as well. The game retains the series' traditional structure of cutscene, mission, boss, cutscene, but you're never out of the fight for too long. What's more, the cutscenes themselves raise the bar for the franchise. Don't get us wrong, this is still schlock of the highest order, but Devil May Cry 5 pulls it off with such swagger that you can't help but love every minute. Plenty of games mistake over-the-top craziness for personality, but Devil May Cry 5 has perfected its blend of badass action and unapologetically dumb jokes.We obviously won't spoil any of it here, but the story of Devil May Cry 5 is more personal than we expected it to be. Despite the world being taken over by a colossal demon tree, the plot hones in on the three main characters and very rarely pulls back to show the broader picture. It's not necessarily a criticism, but you could argue that the game's narrative could have been more ambitious. That said, the plot still does an outstanding job of celebrating Devil May Cry as a whole.And yes, you can quite easily jump into Devil May Cry 5 without having played the previous games, although naturally, select events will have more impact if you're at least familiar with what's come before. Fortunately, the title does include a brief history of the series in the form of a video that you can check out through the main menu, and it's informative enough to get you up to speed without being overwhelming.Devil May Cry 5's campaign will take you around 15 to 20 hours to complete, but as mentioned, the game's highly replayable. There are numerous secrets scattered throughout each mission, and the sheer depth of the combat practically drags you back for more time and time again. On top of that, all of your unlocked moves and red orbs -- in-game currency -- carry over between new runs, and you're always free to jump back to any of the chapters that you've finished.At this point it's also worth mentioning that the game's microtransactions weren't live during the review process. However, over the course of two playthroughs, we had acquired more than enough red orbs to unlock everything that we wanted or needed. With that in mind, we're going to assume that the incoming microtransactions won't make any meaningful difference to the overall experience.Moving on, we can't stress enough just how shockingly good looking Devil May Cry 5 is at times. This could well be the flashiest combat that we've ever seen in a game. Indeed, some of the visual effects are jaw-dropping, and they only add to what is already a visual feast. Our one and only complaint is that the environments are all a bit drab and samey, whether you're running through a crumbling city or battling across a bloody hellscape.But all in all, Capcom's RE Engine is clearly a technical marvel, and Devil May Cry 5 makes for a superb showcase. The icing on the cake is that the entire thing -- cutscenes included -- appears to run at a silky smooth 60 frames per second, even in 4K on PS4 Pro. It's an absolute beauty.Not to be outdone, the soundtrack is predictably stellar. From the immensely popular Devil Trigger to some deliciously heavy boss battle themes, the music is a blast, heightening the tension and providing an additional kick to just about every challenge that the game throws your way.Oh, and before we forget, there is a form of multiplayer in Devil May Cry 5, but it's little more than an interesting concept that's barely explored. In a number of missions, you may see other players -- or at least the recorded gameplay of other players -- going about their business. Because the campaign splits off at points and switches playable characters in the process, you may be playing as Nero and see V wrecking shop across the level, or perhaps Dante's over there showing off his most impressive combos. While it's neat to see what other players are up to, standing there watching them isn't all that much fun, especially since they're usually quite far away, or beyond a wall that makes their battles difficult to view. Again, cool concept, but it feels more than a bit tacked on.Devil May Cry 5 is quite easily one of the best action games on PS4. Flawless in the execution of its often jaw-dropping combat, it's a masterfully crafted title that begs to be played over and over again. Stunning presentation helps sell some of the coolest cutscenes going, and the story ties the series together with style. Among a sea of uninspired open world outings, Devil May Cry 5 is an explosion of character and laser-focused excellence.

When he's not practising combos, he's usually getting lost in the latest 100-hour RPG, or, y'know, replaying The Witcher 3.Comments (95)HELLO AND THANKS FOR READING!I first completed Devil May Cry 5 around five days ago and being unable to tell everyone how amazing it is has been killing me.As a longtime fan of the series, this is the game I had been hoping for since I spent an unhealthy amount of time playing Devil May Cry 3 instead of writing college essays back in the late PS2 days.If anyone's got any questions about the game just let me know. I'm honestly pretty hyped to answer them and finally talk about DMC5 — it's been a long time coming!not into the series myself but i am very happy that the fans have a new fantastic game in the series after the rather disappointing reboot game.it's always nice to see a game get high scores when deserved.Great review, sounds absolutely incredible. Can't wait to play!So excited I can’t contain it. My only big question is does playing as V feel slower paced than when you’re Dante or Nero?I need it to be Friday after work so bad...Aw man, glad the game is fantastic like the older games.Can't wait to start the game once I finish with Kingdom Hearts 3.Ooh my, this review got me excited. I think I need this in my life.Finished DMC1 for the first time recently, and this sounds like my kind of game so I'm sold.@Sakisa V's definitely got a different feel — you could argue it's more strategic than Nero or Dante since you're trying to keep V out of danger — but there's nothing comparatively bad about it. I loved playing as all three characters pretty much equally, and that's just testament to how well designed they are. It's seriously impressive.@ShogunRok HI QUESTION. What's the highest rank you can get? SS like in DMC3? SSS like in DMC4?Capcom just keeps on winning.Will pick this up some time down the line. Would like to play through the series first.It's nice to see Capcom's streak of excellence continuing. I might need to check this series out. I think I own one of these games on PS2, but never got around to trying it. I know for a fact that I own the recent reboot on PC. Maybe I'll give that a go.I was a bit apprehensive about this game, I didn't think they'd be able to capture that old Devil May Cry feel. And then I played the demo.Capcom has been on a role as of late, keep it up.@Arjan127 SSS!And there's a Trophy for it!@ShogunRok Ah, good! Getting ready for that SSS no damage DMD run then, I'D PRESUME?Hmm thios has me tempted. I could never gel with Devil May Cry when I first played back in the day but I've just blasted through Bayonetta and 1 and nearly 2 and loved it and this does look mighty pretty.My ps4 is killing my wallet, I just bought kh3 last weeks, plan to buy re2 remake after I finished kh3 and now I have to buy dmc v and next month, days gone 😂It's great to see the series back on top, capcom is really on fire this gen.@ShogunRok Is the deluxe digital edition worth it?Wow this has sorta snuck up on me. Didn't even know it was due out.This! I am getting really fatigued with open world games and sub par games. Honestly even if a game scores an 8 I'm like ""yeah will check it out one day on a deep sale"". Time is precious and I dont have time for mediocre in my busy schedule. 15 -20 hours of superb gameplay always beats a 100 hour average game for me a anyday. Time to slay some demons.@shonenjump86 definitely. Let's hope the streak continues. Maybe a quality dino crisis reboot? I think it would sell like hotcakes if done well (improve on the story and gameplay like RE2 remake)So happy to read this and know it's living up to hype. I've spent so much time with the series since playing the first game's demo, packaged with RE Code Veronica. Even the second game, which wasn't brilliant, I played the hell out of. Can't wait to add God knows how many more hours to the many hundreds I've already spent with this series.Dang. I've never played a Devil May Cru game before, but you said it's easy for newcomers to jump into right?capcom is back.word up son@ShogunRok Man...so glad to hear it delivered thenHA take that Emo-Dante, at least Ninja Theory can't mess it up anymore@ShogunRok Without spoilers of course, is there unlockable costumes and/or characters?Never played any DMC , they looked like button mashers to me back then... but , after this review...dragon dogma 2 is next.lets go calcium.word up son""At this point it's also worth mentioning that the game's microtransactions weren't live during the review process. However, over the course of two playthroughs, we had acquired more than enough red orbs to unlock everything that we wanted or needed. With that in mind, we're going to assume that the incoming microtransactions won't make any meaningful difference to the overall experience.""Far too often lately, major publishers have been making stealth changes after release to benefit their microtransaction-based mechanics (even bragging about having no microtransactions at launch and just adding them later), and I don't trust the same sort of thing to not happen here (like increasing the amount of red orbs needed to unlock things).Looks like another to buy then!Capcom with their RE Engine are producing some mighty fine games at the moment, I'm impressed to hear a game like this moves at 60fps at 4K (on the pro).I'm due a new telly so I'm going to 4K OLED and buy this as my first one to try on it (then go back to HZD).V looks like Kylo Ren but way cooler! lol Any idea if the Deluxe Edition contents will be sold separately in the PSN Store in the future?@wiiware Funnily enough we got the deluxe version to review. You get some neat extras but nothing too amazing. Not a must-buy in my opinion, but if you're a massive fan maybe you'll get a kick out of going for the deluxe edition.@Broosh Yes.@ShogunRok Ok thanks, I think I'll buy the normal edition. Re2 remake deluxe edition is better I think, with its classic save room soundtrack.@RadoGoji it's far too convenient that they will leave out the micros during the review period just to avoid the negative feedback.Great review! I was playing with cancelling my pre-order due to my backlog. I'm glad I didn't now. @ShogunRok How does the story compare to DMC3? Which I personally thought had a great story. Also a more personal one. Also, how much swearing is there and how annoying is Nico? If there's one thing that turns DMCs corny goodness to cringe, it's swearing. The anime and those fabled DmC conversations always come back to me.@wiiware you don't have to do anything. try working on your will power and budget management skills as well. it's ok to admit if you have a ""problem"".Great review!! Never played a dmc before but played bayonetta 1 and 2 last year and loved them. Definitely on the wish list now. Is the demo still up?To be honest, I am NOT a fan of DMC, past or present. I have never been a fan of the button bashing, combo building type of combat games - whether its DMC or other franchises that use this. Anyone remember Dante's Inferno for example.That being said, its good to see a 'new' game release that excites and delivers a quality game experience. After a run of 'mediocre' AAA releases (even Metro seems divisive), its good to see a game release that's 'new' (not a remake/remaster of an old game - RE2 for example) score well with a reviewer. It was looking like the 'new' games were missing something - whether it was missing the performance expected, the story or the game-play - sometimes all 3. It was looking like new games were struggling to bring something 'new' with the limitations of the hardware to push beyond what other games have done but also keep the performance and visual quality too. Maybe expected as we come to the last years of this generation...@ShogunRok That’s a sexy review, Robert <3.Great to hear that this is Devil May Cry as it should be! I picked the original up pre-owned on a whim years back; I knew nothing about it and was blown away. Even though my combat skills leave a lot to be desired I’ve remained a fan (I’ve even played DMC2 more than once 😁). Was unimpressed by the reboot so a return to form is a joy - it’ll be hitting my console just as soon as my budget permits.@zimbogamer I never played Dino Crisis. Always wanted to, so I’m down for a remake of that.I'm not really interested in this, I've never played Devil May Cry games, but I might just buy this, later on, if only to show my appreciation of their putting a recap video of the previous games IN the game itself. 
That's a great courtesy to newcomers, more developers should do that.DMC isn't really my cup of brew but I agree that Capcom are on a roll lately. Here's hoping for a new Dragon's Dogma with this impressive engine.After playing the demo I knew this was going to very special indeed. The reviews are proving that. This is why I love LINEAR focused games. Just stunning gameplay not diluted by pointless open world nonsense. Kudos to Capcom, roll on Friday.Capcom is on one heck of a run right now. Great review, didn't think I could get more hyped for Friday but now I am. DMC is back!OH COME ON! I had no desire to buy this game and was looking forward to some other releases on the horizon, but now I’m going to have to go out and buy this aren’t I? Thanks a lot, Push Square, you owe me £50@ShogunRok PlayStation Lifestyle sounded far less enthusiastic. Nice to see that other people actually get what this game is about.Good sport, Robert!I'm completely new to the series, but I did quite enjoy the demo, so I'll likely buy this eventually.Gonna get it early tomorrow. I can't wait to jump in.@Jaz007 I think the story is prooooobably my favourite in the series. It's up there with DMC3 for me personally.Not much swearing at all, just a few choice words here and there. Definitely no gratuitous swearing or anything like that — the kind of thing that can make it feel cheap. Used sparingly and well.Nico's not annoying at all. She's weird and a total lunatic, but in a very endearing away. I thought she was great, and she bounces off Nero's personality really well.@PS_Nation SSSexy@Nickolaidas Couldn't stop the hype! I liked Devil May Cry 4 but I never thought it matched Devil May Cry 3, so I've been waiting for a return to that level of excellence for a loooong time. When I finished Devil May Cry 5 I was just so happy that Capcom had brought the series all the way back to its best. Sweet relief.@ShogunRok ""Definitely no gratuitous swearing or anything like that — the kind of thing that can make it feel cheap""So the opposite of DmC, excellent!Time to get the DmC hd Collection. Is there a way to play DmC4 on PS4 with a physical copy?@WanderingBullet No idea about the deluxe edition content releasing separately, but I could totally see Capcom doing music packs and all that kind of stuff.@Spider-Cop I don't... Think so. I think there's just the special edition on the PlayStation Store.@ShogunRok Do you have to play the previous entries to understand what's going on or does the game provide enough background context? I've only played the first DMC a long, long time ago, and I probably won't ever get around playing 2-4.@ShogunRok they just released this handy little story digest video for anyone who wants to watch ithttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-weSxGGzxYit's pretty good if a little cheesy but will get new players up to speed and it's in chronological order too@Nerdfather1 see my above post@FullbringIchigo Thanks, I'll check that out!@Nerdfather1 Yeah you can play the game with little to know context and still have a lot of fun. There's an in-game video that recaps the story, too.I played the demo and enjoyed it, @ShogunRok do i need to have played previous entries to appreciate this one? Thanks.@ShogunRok Oooh, I’m so excited now. I went from playing with canceling the pre-order because of my backlog to being super hyped after reading your review. I’m glad to hear that about Nico too because she hasn’t given me great early impressions, but I have hope that change now.Nevermind just saw your comment.@ShogunRok bummer. I’m a physical copy guy. I’ll buy the collection and if i like it I’ll buy it on the storeI really hope you update us all in a new post on if the micro transactions truly did or didn't change anything like how much things cost or how many things drop.This is critical because they purposely didn't have the microstransactions available to reviewers for a reason.Great review. How is the performance on a base PS4? I know you guys tend to review on a Pro but do you make a point to test the base versions as well? I find many sites don’t bother with this despite the much larger user base.I mean, mileage will vary on the deluxe edition being worth it or not, but the extra bit of money is worth it for me just for the live action cutscene swap. I find that stuff fascinating, and good for a laugh at times too.@ShogunRok I'm someone who beat the original DMC (long long ago) and then played ""DMC"", Ninja Theory, to death on PS4 because of its high frame rate action. The truth is I loathe for a Bayonetta replacement in my heart. I have only played Bayonetta on 360 and still wish I could find an action game with fluid/deep combat that's interesting enough to keep digging into. I lapsed the PlayStation life I led with ps3/360 but I'm back! I need a new Bayonetta! Do you believe this game will fill my void? Thanks!@SegaBlueSky anybody with name and avatar has got be a cool person. Master system, Genesis, DREAMCAST and of course ARCADE. I love SEGA!!Had doubts about this, but sounds like it back to its best.@hookedWORM17 Yes, I think if you're a fan of high tempo, sweat-inducing action that looks stylish as heck, DMC5 is the game for you. Best in class, in my opinion.@ShogunRok Oh you. ^^WOW!... sounds great. Cant wait!Going from Kingdom heats to Metro Exodus to this. And have The Division 2 and Sekiro after.Good Times! (Except for my wallet)@3MonthBeef I like DmC, quite a bit actually, but it's not a patch on the numbered Devil May Cry games.@3MonthBeef Yeah the game was kinda fun even if the Dante in it was an arse but that gif was too good not to post@Frigate I think some games just cap out at certain scores, even if they don't have any notable flaws. Our scoring policy describes a 10 as:""The pinnacle of a given genre at the time of release, these titles raise the bar in virtually all critical categories. You can be sure that a game awarded this score has the highest quality presentation and expertly honed gameplay, but also breaks boundaries and pushes the industry forward in a meaningful manner.""While I think DMC5 is pretty much the pinnacle of the character action genre right now, I don't think it breaks any boundaries — it's just a really good DMC game.The way we look at it is games don't start out at a 10 and then drop a point every time they get something wrong. So like I said, games can ""cap"" at a certain score. For example, I've played loads of games that I think are great, virtually nothing wrong with them, but an 8/10 is as far as they go because they don't amaze in any way.Hope that makes some sense!Hmm, just pre-ordered on a whim. I loved Bayonetta and DMC1 back in the day, but the subsequent releases didn't grab me. I checked out some vids on youtube and like how much heft but also fluidity the combat has to it. I think I will enjoy this.Great review, BTW.@FullbringIchigo DmC was great. Maybe not as good as this, but still enjoyable for many people.@naruball and like i said in another post i liked the game from a game play perspective but the Dante in that game was an unlikable arse@ShogunRok Character Action isn't a real thing(link to video if the video wont work, it usually doesn't https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VkkeXIfNKI)@FullbringIchigo https://youtu.be/qKVSCb5oJc0@ShogunRok I caved and downloaded it thanks to your positive review, it's my birthday at the end of the month so i'm allowed!@Sakisa interesting, it could make a good discussion thread, ""is there really such a thing as a Stylish Action Game""@get2sammyb Hey, Sammy when is the article on the February Game of The Month coming? It's my fave article of the first week of each month. Bring it on!@MightyDemon82 I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!@Oscarjpc Game of the Month should be published on Friday if all goes to plan. It's running late!Well I was going to.wait on this but after all the glowing reviews I'm about to order ! My wallet really doesn't like push square.Done 3 chapters already and managed S Rank on 2, not bad for my first DMC, loving it so far.So happy to see this game getting back to excel! I skipped 4 and didn’t even look at that EMO-trash. I didn’t even know this is out. Will go pick it up now.Right now that's finished can we please have a Dragon's Dogma sequel.Their Micro Transactions May go to Hell!Devil May Cry 5 is absolutely perfection!this game one if not the best game in 2019 i hope a good place for it in 2019 games awards.

Devil May Cry 5,Francesco De Meo,Wccftech,https://wccftech.com/review/devil-may-cry-v-devil-trigger-pulled/,"The Devil May Cry series, with the release of the original game on PlayStation 2, changed action games forever, setting such a high a bar that to this day only a few titles can compare. With the previous two entries in the series, however, things weren't all that good: Devil May Cry 4 suffered from a campaign that reused stages and locations of the first half for the second, while the reboot wasn't well received by long-time fans of the series, mostly due to how it didn't feel like Devil May Cry at all. A long silence followed, and fans were losing hope of ever seeing Dante, Nero, Vergil and the rest of the gang kick some demon ass again. They didn't surrender, as Devil May Cry 4's main theme suggested, and now they have been rewarded for their patience in the best possible way: Devil May Cry V is, without a doubt, the best entry in the series so far.Devil May Cry V stars both Nero and Dante, as well as a brand new and mysterious character called V. On a fateful night, Dante's friend Morrison brings V to Devil May Cry, where he asks Dante to take on an extremely powerful demon called Urizen. The demon has attacked Redgrave City, and a giant demonic tree called the Qlipoth is absorbing the blood of humans to power the demon king. Dante heads out to the city together with Trish and Lady to take down Urizen and save not only Redgrave City but the entire world.Nero, who's been working as a devil hunter since the end of Devil May Cry 4, also gets involved in this battle. Some time before the beginning of the game, he is attacked by a hooded man who manages to take his Devil Bringer arm and reclaim Yamato, Vergil's sword. Nero eventually learns that this has been done to give power to Urizen, so he also sets out to recover his arm and settle the score.Devil May Cry V's story is the best in the entire series. While it basically boils down to the usual saving the world from a demonic invasion trope, the plot is much more focused on the characters who all have a very good reason for going up against Urizen. There are a lot of cutscenes between and during missions which not only provide additional development for the three main characters but also a few extremely wacky scenes that lighten the atmosphere a little every now and then. The plot also features some very interesting twists and a satisfactory ending to round it all.While the game's plot is very good for Devil May Cry standards, as expected where the game truly shines is in the gameplay. Devil May Cry V features three playable characters and all three come with their own unique fighting styles. Nero and Dante play a lot as they did in Devil May Cry 4, which is not a surprise, but there are some tweaks that make controlling them better than ever.Before the game begins Nero loses his Devil Bringer arm, but the issue is quickly remedied by his friend Nico who creates the Devil Breakers, prosthetic arms each coming with some unique attacks, as well as the ability to use Snatch like Nero's original demon arm. Devil Breakers expand Nero's combat possibilities in several ways: one Devil Breaker, Gerbera, allows him to unleash a powerful shockwave that can also be used to quickly dodge attacks, continue air combos and so on. Another Devil Breaker, Punch Line, allows him to launch a missile that can also be ridden. Another, called Tomboy, powers up Nero's sword and gun attacks, essential working as a style switching option. These are just a few of the Devil Breakers available in the game: all have their own uses and none feels worthless. The Devil Breakers also add another interesting layer of depth to using Nero, as it's not possible to switch them on the fly: to change a Devil Breaker, the currently equipped one must be destroyed, which can happen if hit while using its related ability or by detonating it in the middle of battle. Additional Devil Breakers can be easily found during missions, so you will hardly run out of them.Dante also plays a lot like his Devil May Cry 4 counterpart, with the ability to switch between four different fighting styles on the fly - Trickster, which focuses on evasive maneuvers, Gunslinger, which focuses on firearms, Swordmaster, which focuses on melee weapons, and Royal Guard, which focuses on Defense. All styles can also be powered up to unlock new moves which vastly expand Dante's combat possibilities. While the character does play a lot like his previous iteration, it soon becomes clear how he has become even more complicated to master, mostly due to the new melee weapons. While the basic sword techniques are still the same, the new weapons are extremely creative: Barlog, the new gauntlet weapon, comes with two different attack modes, fists, and kicks, which can be switched on the fly. The same goes for Cerberus, which can be transformed into different weapons on the fly. Devil May Cry V now allows players to bring four different melee weapons as well as four guns, as opposed to the three in Devil May Cry 4 during the first playthrough, providing the ability to perform some incredibly crazy multi-weapon combos.V is the brand new character introduced in Devil May Cry V, and he is among the most unique characters ever seen in the whole franchise. He is extremely frail and cannot fight demons directly, so he needs the help of his three friendly demons to actually do the fighting for him. Griffon is a flying demon that can unleash a variety of long-range attacks; Shadow is a tiger-like demon that can unleash short range attacks, while Nightmare (which can only be summoned by activating Devil Trigger) is an incredibly powerful demon equipped with excellent crowd-controlling attacks. The three demons, however, cannot finish enemies off so players will still have to get close to them to finish them off with V's cane attack. While the three demons have a lot of different abilities, using V feels limited compared to Nero and Dante: he's meant to be played as a sort of long-range focused character, so the three demons' attacks are not as responsive as the other characters'. Despite this, V is still a very nice addition which brings more variety to the mix.The new mechanics for Nero and Dante and new character V aren't the only features that make Devil May Cry V such a great game to play. The variety of enemies is commendable, with new demons getting introduced even pretty late in the game. While the weakest enemies can be taken down with ease, some of the strongest ones require players to learn their attack patterns, break their attacks or stances and so on. The best thing about the enemy design is that almost all of the enemies can be staggered and launched in the air with ease, unlike previous entries in the series where most enemies would force players to use the same attacks over and over without the possibility to style on them. Making things even better is how the camera is handled during combat, zooming out as needed to give players the best possible view of their surroundings, preventing them to get damaged by attacks coming from outside the viewable area. Dodging mechanics are also more fluid than ever, with all three characters performing sidesteps when dodging close to an enemy rather than a full roll like in previous entries in the series.Bosses are another strong point of Devil May Cry V, as the developers were able to avoid them feeling like a rehash of what has been seen in previous installments. And there are quite a few of them, with most of the missions ending with a big, epic battle against powerful demons.Level design is quite good as well, but not exactly a true step beyond what we have seen in Devil May Cry 4. The game begins in Red Grave City, but the city itself gets more and more warped with demonic elements as the game proceeds, easing players into the full-blown demonic locations of the final missions. Locations are extremely dynamic, taking a page out of the DmC book with buildings crumbling, paths opening and so on. There are also some very light puzzles that can be completed with ease. All locations sport multiple paths with additional Red Orbs, Fragments, and even Secret Missions, which are cleverly hidden and require players to complete a very easy mini-game to access. Better yet, they can also be replayed from the main menu, which should make completing all of them less frustrating than ever.Devil May Cry V is still divided into different missions, so game progression is not different from what we have seen in the past. They are much longer than usual, however, so the game does feel longer than previous entries. A few missions also allow players to choose which character to use, so these missions must be replayed multiple times in order to see everything the game has to offer. Sadly, it's not possible to play all missions with all characters, which feels a bit limited, considering there aren't many V missions. At the end of each mission, the player's performance will be evaluated, and the higher it is, the more Red Orbs will be awarded.Speaking of Red Orbs, which are used to purchase upgrades for all three characters, there have been complaints of them being sold with real money through microtransactions. The in-game economy doesn't suffer from this at all, as the game is extremely generous with them. There are some specific upgrades that need a lot of Red Orbs to unlock, but replaying through the game at higher difficulties is more than enough to get the required amount.The presentation in Devil May Cry V is just as good as the rest of the game. The game's aesthetics have been clearly influenced by DmC, sporting a more realistic design for characters and locations as well as camera cuts and changing locations which have been lifted straight from the reboot developed by Ninja Theory. It's also very well optimized and runs great on a PC powered by an i7-3770 CPU, GTX 980 Ti GPU and 16 GB RAM; there are no performance drops even with everything set to Ultra during the most hectic battle sequences, at least when running at 1080p resolution.The soundtrack is also great, especially the battle themes. The way music has been implemented is reminiscent of the approach taken by Platinum Games for Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, with the intensity increasing dynamically as the battle goes on. In the case of Devil May Cry V, the chorus of each theme starts playing when an S combat rank is achieved during battle. Nero's Devil Trigger theme is definitely the best among the battle themes, but also V and Dante's theme tend to grow on the listener. Voice acting is well done too, with all returning characters played by their Devil May Cry 3 and 4 voice actors.Devil May Cry V is, without a doubt, the best entry in the series so far, taking everything that made Devil May Cry 3 and 4 good and bringing everything up a notch. Those who only wish to play the game through once at regular difficulty will ""only"" see Devil May Cry V as a very good action game that can keep them engaged from beginning to end, but veterans of the series will see it as the deep, fun and engaging game they have been waiting for over ten years.Reviewed on PC (code provided by the publisher). Devil May Cry V is the best entry in the series and one of the best character action games ever released. In addition to its excellent combat mechanics and level design, which expand greatly on the elements introduced in past games, the story and characters had never before received such focus in Devil May Cry. The game may be lacking in extra content such as the fan-favorite Bloody Palace mode at launch, but don't let this small flaw prevent you from getting what will surely be one of the 2019 Game of the Year contenders.The links above are affiliate links.

Devil May Cry 5,Garri Bagdasarov,PlayStation Universe,https://www.psu.com/reviews/devil-may-cry-5-review/," Garri Bagdasarov / March 6, 2019Devil May Cry 5 has been a long time coming for DMC fans, myself included. The game has a lot going for it, featuring three playable characters and a healthy spread of different usable weapons. However, DMC 5 also suffers from some issues that could have easily been avoided.Set years after the events of Devil May Cry 4, the story of DmC 5 begins with Dante, Trish, Lady, and Nero facing off against a powerful new demon, named Urizen. The team is easily brought down to its knees as the demon is too powerful for their combined assault. Newcome V shows up to lend a hand and is forced by Dante to rescue Nero, but the Demon is too strong and our protagonists have to retreat.The story then picks up a month later, with Nero heading back to the city where Urizen resides in hopes of finding Dante and defeating the demon.The game is very rich in cutscenes and they impress with praiseworthy graphics. Each mission features some cutscenes at the start and end with very few in between. This helps with the pacing because there are no big interruptions while you slay the enemy demons. Compared to previous DmC games a bigger effort was made on storytelling. Though some fans may guess the big reveals before reaching the halfway point, there are moments in the game where I was surprised by how the events transpired.This brings me to the actual characters. Let’s talk about Dante first. Dante is exactly like you remember him to be. He’s cool, stylish, overconfident, and cocky. The problem is he really starts to show you how selfish and one dimensional he really is.There is one scene in particular where you acquire a new hat that is so ridiculous, even by Devil May Cry standards, that I had to stop playing and wondered to myself who possibly thought this was a good idea. To make it worse, it happens during a serious sequence of events. You’ll know it when you see it.Then there’s Nero, who is the spitting image of Ninja Theory’s Dante, not just in looks but in personality. Nero essentially is DmC’s Dante. Thankfully, Nero has one of the best new mechanics in the game. The Devil Breaker arms add a lot to both combat and exploration. The different Devil Breakers vary rather nicely, allowing Nero to pull off some crazy combos.These range in style and usability. One Devil Breaker sees Nero launching a cool rocket arm that fly’s around, punching enemies from a distance. Nero can also ride this rocket arm like a hoverboard. There are a lot of these Devil Breakers in DMC5, and they all provide a different experience. The biggest problem I found with them though is you can’t switch between them without destroying them. So instead of allowing me to switch between them during combat, I would have to destroy the one I have equipped in order to access the next one in line.Newcomer V unfortunately really drags the game down. Besides having a resemblance to Adam Driver, V himself is a very boring character. He’s so mopey and speaks in irrelevant riddles. I dreaded having to play with him. V’s bird companion actually has more personality than he does.V plays much differently from Nero and Dante. V himself doesn’t actually fight. Instead, he summons monsters to fight for him. His bird is essentially his gun while his black panther is his melee weapon. The problem I encountered while playing with V is that instead of fighting, I’m watching from a distance while these summons fight for him. Even though I’m controlling them, it’s challenging to pull off good combos because of the camera and positioning of not only V but of his summons on-screen and the position they’re facing.I should mention that the rest of the cast is pretty much a dud. Outside of Nico, who is a nice surprise: a weaponsmith for Dante and Nero. She was fun at first but she grew to be a little irritating with her constant 90s-era jokes that just made her sound immature. Even Nero got tired of it in a later story scene as he points it out himself. Lady and Trish, on the other hand, don’t serve any real purpose in the story. It’s almost as if they were included just to remind us they exist.Devil May Cry 5 has 20 missions in total. They start strong with great city locations. Seeing how the town is being torn apart by the demons is a nice touch that showcases the RE Engine nicely. This is quickly abandoned in favor of horrible, sewers, catacombs, subway systems, and a series of missions that take place inside a tree reminiscent of a Xenomorph colony. The level design after about the eighth mission becomes so boring to look at. It got to the point where I couldn’t even tell if I was playing a different level from before. It’s a shame because the RE Engine is capable of some spectacular scenery, which was displayed to great effect earlier in the game.In the Spirit of Devil May Cry, missions have plenty of secrets to hide, secret missions to tackle, and orb fragments to find. This encourages exploration, especially with Nero and V. Their unique abilities can be used as exploration devices, allowing them to do various things to reach higher locations and even uncover hidden ones.Combat in Devil May Cry 5 can also be hit and miss. I loved being able to pull off strings of combos by combining different skills and abilities, especially with Nero’s Devil Breakers. Regardless, the combat felt a little slower than it did in Devil May Cry 4. It’s also a lot easier to get stylish combos because enemies, especially early on, aren’t really aggressive. So they won’t attack you enough for you to lose your ranking.Each of the three characters have a plethora of abilities and skills to unlock. Red Obs are shared between the three characters but you should always have enough to unlock skills at the start of each mission. It was never an issue for me to acquire the skills I wanted.Another issue is the constant character change from mission to mission. As soon as I get the hang of one character, the next mission will switch to another character, and I have to recollect how the next character plays. It wouldn’t be so bad if some of the skills did the same types of attack. Some of the same attacks for Nero and Dante have different button presses, and it completely threw me off on multiple occasions.The RE Engine shines once again with the monster designs, much like it did in Resident Evil 2 Remake. The monster designs are some of the best in the franchise’s history and most of the boss battles are fantastic and downright nasty and creepy to look at. I wish the game had a boss rush mode of some sorts so I can go back and replay these battles without having to go through the entire level again.Devil May Cry has always had a stylish soundtrack but Devil May Cry 5’s soundtrack isn’t as memorable as past titles. The nice thing is you can go into a jukebox in the main menu and set what combat music you prefer. If you prefer a specific characters battle song, you can set it for all three characters. You can even purchase DLC themes from past Devil May Cry games if you choose and have those tracks play during combat.It’s been a long journey for Devil May Cry 5, and for the most part it’s a successful one. It may not be the huge return for the franchise’s original saga that some may have hoped for, but it’s a fair return nonetheless.Devil May Cry V is the game fans have been waiting for, for better or for worse. It's not the best in the franchise but it's a welcome and stylish return to the original Devil May Cry saga.

Devil May Cry 5,Alexander Thomas,COGconnected,https://cogconnected.com/review/devil-may-cry-5-review/,"Developed by Capcom and directed by series veteran Hideaki Itsuno, Devil May Cry 5 is a game we secretly wished for but never expected to come to fruition. Given the lackluster reception to the attempted franchise reboot in DMC: Devil May Cry, it was easy to think the legacy that was built with Dante was behind us. However, Devil May Cry 5 ignores the previous entry and picks up shortly after the events of the fourth game, this time following the previous protagonist and third child of Sparda, Nero. With the fate of the world at stake and once again invaded by demons, Nero and the iconic cast of the DMC series must come together to prevent global catastrophe.The Devil May Cry franchise has always been one of captivating beauty, often reflecting gothic architecture, modern chaos, and a splash of stylish gore that has helped cement the series’ iconic status. Using current gen consoles to their fullest potential, Nero’s latest mission looks absolutely gorgeous with incredible photorealism. Everything from the characters, the demons, and even the environment itself looks breathtaking as you fill your surroundings with the entrails of your foes. Cutscenes, in particular, are directed and crafted so well I found myself hoping for this to turn into a feature-length movie, with the bond between Nero, Nico, and V, molded with such nuance that it’s easy to believe they are longtime allies, if not still comfortably estranged.With the original DMC team returning to work on the game, anyone who has played a Devil May Cry game will feel mostly at home with the combat and controls of Nero. Mostly. Having played the first three games in the recent remaster trilogy, I was used to the pace and speed that Dante set as opposed to the slower and slightly more methodical Nero. His single gun packs more punch but fires slower, his single jump is effective for dodging but in combat, he has to rely on grappling to move around the battlefield quickly. He feels heavier than Dante yet the game as a whole feels much more forgiving than its predecessors.The new Devil Breaker mechanic can be fun, but it isn’t explained particularly well in game how all of it works. Nero is missing the demonic part of his right arm and in its place Nico has built a series of replacement arms, each with unique abilities. You can find arms scattered throughout a level, as well as choose your loadout whenever you reach the van. Arms will break down after being used too much and can also be sacrificed and detonated for massive damage, however, I have yet to find an option to cycle through the available arms in my loadout while in the field. It’s a neat mechanic to add and offers more customization to your combat.The real standout addition to the game is the newcomer, V. With a mysterious background and untold powers, you’ll eventually get the chance to play as V in the story and while it took me a short time to adjust to his unique playstyle and controls, I found myself hoping for V to get his own game down the road. Being physically weaker, V’s combat abilities come from summoning Griffon, a demonic bird, and Shadow, a demonic panther. Each one is controlled with a face button and so you simply need to keep V away from combat and control these familiars from a distance. V must deal the killing blow to end an enemy, and he does so in style with his unique cane sword, often following it up with an articulate quip or quote from his book. If V were to get his own game with these same mechanics I would happily play it.For those jumping into Devil May Cry for the first time, the game offers a very well written recap of the previous games to catch you up to speed – the series did launch back in 2001 after all – and for those who are familiar with the exploits of Dante, it proves to be a fantastic refresher in case you forgot some of the key points of what the Son of Sparda has done and how Nero came into the picture. I would also be remiss if I neglected to mention just how stellar the soundtrack for DMC 5 is. This has always been a series about pumping some hard music into your face while you slash demons to pieces, but this year feels a cut above. Each riff, each raspy, screamed lyric only adds to the atmosphere and sense of total badassness that Nero exudes.In fact beyond the somewhat complex controls which can take a little while to get used to, the only real downside I came across in the game was minor frame-rate issues during cutscenes, and even then it happened rarely. Whether you loved or hated the attempted reboot, Devil May Cry 5 should put even the most hardcore fans concerns to rest. The action is bloody amazing, the graphics are drop-dead gorgeous, and Nero owns every moment of his screen time with an iron fist.Devil May Cry 5 excels at bringing back that iconic feeling the franchise is known for and does so with killer style, strategic, fast-paced combat, and a pumping soundtrack. With a cast of both familiar faces in Trish and Lady, as well as newcomers Nico and V, this is a game that gives me confidences for the future of the Devil May Cry series. Every cutscene feels like it belongs in a movie, and every battle feels powerful and intense as each new ability is unlocked. The only fault the game has shown me is a drop in frame rate during a few cutscenes but is definitely nothing to be worried about.

This doesn't affect our editorial independence.Devil May Cry 5 should satisfy your hack-and-slack itch in a big way. Huge, Hollywood-esque attacks are amped up by insane combos and devastating effects to create something truly satisfying, and the story has a lot to offer too.It’s been a long 11 years since fans last got a proper Devil May Cry game, interrupted only by the controversial reboot /spin-off DmC – developed by Ninja Theory – but Capcom gave fans what they were looking for at E3 2018 when it revealed 
Devil May Cry 5.A proper continuation of the original series, the new game has once again been developed in-house at Capcom, with plenty of series veterans back at work to create it – even the original voice actors of Nero and Dante came back for the big reunion.So, is it the Devil May Cry title that fans have been yearning for? Find out in our Devil May Cry 5 review.Devil May Cry 5 is set to make its debut roughly 11 years after its predecessor, with the release set for 8 March 2019 across PS4, Xbox One and PC.

Amazon ($59.99) in the US.Devil May Cry 5 is a return to the main series after the controversial DmC: Devil May Cry spin-off a few years ago, bringing the series back to what it does best; hacking-and-slashing demons with style and a splash of comedy.Dante and Nero are back, along with the mysterious V, with the aim of unveiling the mystery behind the blood-sucking demon tree Qliphoth at the centre of Red Grave City, which looks suspiciously like London – complete with off-brand tube trains, points of interest (we spotted Borough Market – or Burrow Market as it’s branded in-game) and more. We’ll post no campaign spoilers here but we will say that it’s full of twists, turns and revelations that long-time fans of the series will thoroughly enjoy, but it’s not perfect.Once you hit the middle of the campaign, things become a bit of a slog. Environments look increasingly similar, you fight the same types of demon over and over again and there’s not much happening in terms of story. Thankfully, that’s remedied by a game-shattering twist that reignites the story and spices up combat too.Devil May Cry 5 has three playable characters; Dante, Nero and V. You’ll switch between the three characters at various points in the campaign, which helps keep combat exciting and engaging as you pummel your way through seemingly infinite hordes of Demons. Why? Each character has a very different style of combat – and even different button combos – with varying strengths and weaknesses that you have to use to your advantage to get the coveted Smokin’ Sexy Style combo rank.V, for example, has a completely different fighting experience to the other Demon Hunters as he’s much weaker physically and can’t get too close to Demons without taking serious damage. However, he makes up for it with a handful of shadow animals that do his bidding for him while he stays at a safe distance. While that might sound like a bit of a cop-out, V still has to get into the fray to finish enemies off – something only he can do.Nero, on the other hand, gets right into the action with a combination of swords, guns and an amazing collection of Devil Bringers. Devil Bringers are robotic arms new to Devil May Cry 5 that deal serious damage, but are also fragile – if you get hit mid-attack, you’ll lose the arm entirely. Thankfully you can carry a few of them, with different arms offering different styles of attack, but there’s a catch; you can’t switch between them freely.This introduces a wrinkle of strategy to worry about mid-fight; do you resist using your Devil Bringer in hectic fights to avoid running out completely, or do you voluntarily destroy your current arm to equip a more powerful one in your inventory? It’s a decision you’ll find yourself constantly asking yourself when playing as Nero. The good news is that Devil Bringers can be replenished at various points in the campaign, and you’ll find them sprinkled throughout the environment too – you’ve just got to keep an eye out for secret areas (of which there are plenty).When it comes to truly OTT weapons and attacks, Dante is your guy. As well as wielding fairly standard swords and guns, Dante gets access to an insane demon-infused motorbike that splits in half and can be used in battles to cause serious damage. There are other, equally-insane weapons at Dante’s disposal, but we don’t want to ruin the surprise for fans. He can also temporarily summon his inner demon, causing huge damage to any nearby enemies while restoring health and vitality.But as well as having access to a range of crazy weaponry, Dante also has four skillsets that you can switch between at any point in battle. These skillsets bring unique abilities, like being able to block almost any attack, zip around the environment in the blink of an eye or cause insane up-close damage with a sword, that can change the tide of a battle as well as boost up your style combo.There’s incredible depth to combat when it comes to Dante, and he’s hands-down our favourite character to play with.Combat starts off relatively simple, but it grows more complex as time goes on; as you fight your way through the campaign and upgrade each character’s unique abilities, you’ll get access to more moves, weapons and forms to really bring the pain to the Demons in style. Observation and learning the rhythm of your opponents is crucial to success, especially in Demon Hunter mode where a single blow can be fatal.Button combinations can be confusing, especially once you’ve unlocked a whole host of additional attacks and when used in fast succession to build combos. While it’s nothing new for fans of the series, it can be a little overwhelming for newbies, but that’s why Capcom includes an Auto system to chain together various attacks and abilities to make the learning curve a little easier and more enjoyable (at the cost of blood orbs).The game has come a long way in the 10 years since the last Devil May Cry title, not only in terms of combat but visuals too.Devil May Cry 5 runs on Capcom’s fancy new REngine, the same engine that powers the gorgeous Resident Evil 7 and Resident Evil 2 remake, and despite being designed for zombie destruction, the engine handles the shift to a very different style of game surprisingly well. Animations are fast and fluid (a must for precision fighters), there are lots of pretty particle effects and impressively lifelike facial animations, but we must admit that the lip-syncing is definitely off in places.But despite little niggles, the game looks fantastic; the Demon-infested city based on London is stunning, and that extends to demons too. Whether you’re staring into the stomach/mouth of the Goliath or being attacked by Cerberus, the three-headed demon dog, you’re in awe at how amazing (and disgusting) characters look and move.  Whether you’re new to the series or a long-time fan, Devil May Cry 5 should satisfy your hack-and-slack itch in a big way. While it can be hard to get to know the ins and outs of each character, once it clicks, it’s an absolute joy to play. Huge, Hollywood-esque attacks are amped up by insane combos and devastating effects to create something truly satisfying.The Demon-infested environment is intricately designed, demons are varied and boss fights are a challenge.
