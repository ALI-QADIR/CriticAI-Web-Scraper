Link: Official siteWelcome to the era of the lifestyle game, where products are conceived, crafted and sold as persistent experiences intended to become a cornerstone of your leisure time. The brute force RPG treadmills of the monolithic noughties MMOs have given way to snackable games that use levels, loot boxes, card packs and incremental uneven rewards to entice us into putting in a few hours every week until the next game or expansion comes out. Destiny 2 is your next lifestyle game, but not because its progression systems are more enticing, or because its loot is particularly fabulous, but because it is a world-class shooter and a chill time with friends.Destiny 2 is a persistent online FPS set in our solar system in the distant future. Four alien factions have converged on Earth to seize the power of a vast orb called the Traveler, which acts as humanity's silent protector. The Traveler's tiny drones, known as Ghosts, resurrect humans to serve as immortal Guardians charged with defending the planet. There are three flavours of Guardian to choose from. Warlocks can zap enemies with lightning, Emperor Palpatine style; Titans throw down shield walls and punch bad guys really hard; Hunters shank foes while dodge-rolling and tethering hordes with shots from a bow made of glittering purple energy. You pick your class, design your character, and get levelling.It's a game of three phases. The singleplayer story gets you to level 20 and introduces the universe map, which you'll use for the next hundred or so hours to fly between planets to explore their open world zones, take on three-player Strikes (dungeons, to you and me), fight other players in 4v4 Crucible contests, and eventually take on the six-player raid. As you move through the story Destiny 2 starts laying the groundwork for phase two, beyond level 20, when you start hunting for weapons and armour to grow your new power level from 100 up to 305. This means repeating strikes, taking on public events in open world zones and doing short missions called adventures that extend the story on each planet. Phase three kicks in when you're close to the power level cap. At this point most activities in the game drop worthless lower level rewards and the game sputters out. You can expect 30 or so hours of quality shooting before you hit Destiny 2's doldrums. I think the journey is worth it.Destiny 2's plot is simple. A warlord called Ghaul leads the lumbering rhino-people called the Cabal in an attack on Earth. He wants to siphon off the Traveller's power for himself, and you have to stop him across five or six hours of missions scattered across Earth, Titan, Nessus and IO.  As the old Arthur C. Clarke saying goes, any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Destiny's fiction lives in this blurred area. Guns housing advanced AI fire ammunition that breaks apart reality. You might find wearing a far-future astronaut suit, or a helmet made from the bones of an extinct race of space dragons. Destiny's universe works better when you consider it as an anthology of these cool sci-fi ideas rather than a linear story. The Cabal are the main threat in this game, but every faction can bring their bespoke on-brand apocalypse scenario to bear whenever Bungie releases an expansion. The zombie-like Hive wants to consume everything to feed the symbiotic worm creatures that infest them. The cybernetic Vex want to resolve the ambiguities of the universe into a perfect network, which involves wiping out species that inconvenience them.With practice you find yourself switching between weapons on the fly to take care of specific threats, chucking grenades into mobs, punching charging enemies into a million crackling pieces and repositioning with a jet-powered jump.They all die beautifully, and the vast majority of your interactions with Destiny's curious universe happen at end of a gun. I get a rare feeling of satisfaction from taking a headshot in Destiny 2, and there is a deeply rewarding rhythm to combat encounters. Whichever class you choose you have access to a grenade and a melee attack, which recharge on cooldowns after each use. You have a loadout of three weapons to-hand (though it's easy to duck into the menu to swap these out if you wish). Kinetic weapons deal standard damage; energy weapons carry elemental charge that you use to shatter shields; heavy weapons are your big hitters, and include shotguns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers and even swords. With practice you find yourself switching between weapons on the fly to take care of specific threats, chucking grenades into mobs, punching charging enemies into a million crackling pieces and repositioning with a jet-powered jump. If enemies are massing, a tough boss turns up, or you've just had enough, you can activate your super power. Hunters can break out the bow, one-shot enemies with a flaming gun, or dice up mobs with an electric staff depending on the subclass you have equipped—warlocks and titans have their own variants.After hundreds of hours of Destiny 1 and many hours of Destiny 2, it still feels great to dismantle a mob like this, and Bungie's shooter expertise translates surprisingly well onto PC. Mouse and keyboard controls, combined with a stable 60 fps of performance, adds an extra sense of control and fluidity. My experience with the PC version has been excellent. Destiny 2 has extensive settings menus that let you gear the game to your rig. It feels great to broaden out the field of view and absorb more of the game's gorgeous space vistas. Some of the default key bindings are off for me, but these too can be extensively rearranged to fit your setup.Destiny 2 has a loot box system that lets you use real money and scarce in-game currency to buy cosmetic items from the 'Eververse' store.Your level caps out at 20, but you continue to earn XP and fill your levelling bar past this point. Each time your levelling bar fills up you get a 'bright' engram that decodes into a package of premium cosmetic materials. These can be ships that you show off on loading screens, new skins for exotic guns, emotes, and shaders that change the colour of your gear.You can also buy XP boosters that apply to you and your fireteam, however this simply accelerates the rate at which you're getting bright engrams for filling the levelling bar after 20. Shaders drop so often in the main game that I have never even considered buying a package with real money. It's an unintrusive and easily ignored loot box system, and you get regular drops from the premium pool as you play.Destiny 2's first 20 hours are exhilarating. You see new planets, each of which benefits from some extraordinary art direction. Titan's missions take place on an industrial complex on stilts, which sustains a vast golden age arcology overrun by the Hive's corruption. The zone flows from man-made superstructures into defunct futuristic museum. The range of visual ideas in this one place alone would be enough to sustain a game by itself. Inevitably the splendour of the universe fades as you start blasting through zones to find a public event and try to secure some 280 power trousers, but there are few sci-fi games on PC that match Bungie's vision. The raid, when it arrives a week or so after launch, takes place in an opulent golden space palace.It's a spectacular place to be, especially with friends. Destiny 2's positive multiplayer environment is as vital to the game's success as its weapon and encounter design. There is no public chat. Instead you opt in to communication, via voice or text, with your team mates in PvP, or your co-op fireteam. If you set the option in the menus, you can choose to receive whispers from strangers, but otherwise your communication with strangers is limited to comedy emotes. Agile menus let you seamlessly glide into co-op fireteams. Few games let you segue in and out of co-op so easily, and Destiny's imposed silence leaves no room for shitty behaviour.Destiny 2 is a limited game if you play purely solo, but it is almost impossible to do that. Singleplayer missions move in and out of public spaces, and the game seems especially likely to trigger public events in these moments. These impromptu free-for-all missions often see an alien faction drop an objective into the world—a mining drone, perhaps, or a scanner—which you then have to defend against waves of incoming enemies. Everyone who runs into the area joins the event and becomes part of a ragtag assembly of fellow Guardians blasting hundreds of enemies for the promise of a treasure chest. Destiny is designed to let you flow organically through the gamut of activities, teaming up with friends and strangers as you go. Each play session is consists of a selection of public events, adventures, lost sectors (very short dungeons in public zones featuring a boss and chest), the odd Strike, and PvP.The PvP Crucible is divided into two playlists called 'quick play' and 'competitive', and each consists of a selection of rotating modes. All of the bouts are four-on-four contests. All level differences are removed, but everyone is free to bring any guns from their armoury into the fight. A quick play match will randomly throw you into a team deathmatch scenario, a control point capture mode or supremacy mode, which is the best of the three. In supremacy every player drops a glowing crystalline 'engram' when they die. You pick up enemy crystals to score points, and secure friendly ones to deny your opponents. Supremacy creates an exciting tension between long and short-range weapons—picking someone off with a sniper is useless if you can't pick up their engram, but might be the right move if allies are closer to the kill zone. Expect lots of baseball slides to secure engrams under fire, and look out for Guardians rampaging with swords.The game runs at a solid 60+ fps at 1080p on a GTX 970 with settings on ultra. There is a wide range of settings that give you control over your window mode, resolutions, Vsync, field of view, screen bounds, brightness, anti-aliasing, SSAO, texture anisotropy, texture quality, shadow quality, shadow quality, depth of field, environmental details, character detail distance, foliage shadows distance, light shafts, motion blur, wind impulse, HDR, chromatic aberration, and film grain. There are extensive key rebinding options too.Performance faltered for me when I moved onto a 4K monitor. At this level you will need a top graphics card and to move some settings down to get a decent framarate. The anti-aliasing solutions aren't amazing but if you have a top card on a 1080p display consider upping the render resolution. It costs a lot of frames, but smooths out Destiny 2's jaggies.Read our full performance analysis from the beta for more.Competitive mode is split between a Counter-Strike style attacker vs. defender bomb defusal mode, and the brilliant survival mode. This gives each team a pool of eight lives, shared between players. It's team deathmatch with extra reason to be cautious. Tension escalates as both teams go low, and rounds can often end with a clutch play in a one-on-one showdown. Both of these modes also feature in the elite Trials of the Nine challenge, which is scheduled to arrive at weekends from November onwards. Here the most skilled Guardians with the best PvP gear battle for access to a special vendor who sells her own set of elite items.Destiny PvP is unconventional by PC shooter standards. Positioning and skillful reading of the radar are essential skills. The best teams sit on comms and carefully manage their supers and loadouts to maximise their killing efficiency (letting off a super generates power orbs that pals can collect to charge more supers). Twitch skill is certainly a bonus, but mobile objectives, small teams and smartly designed maps strongly discourage camping and lone snipers. It's a fun drop-in experience that serves as a consistently entertaining diversion, though if you are mainly interested in strong player vs. player team shooter, you are better off with any of the big dedicated arena shooters.Co-op Strikes are another important feature, but it's telling that they feel so superfluous at the moment. There are five, but they are only accessible via a random playlist that often forces you into. Strikes are full missions set in specially built areas. They normally consist of a series of combat encounters that culminate in a big boss fight, but feature some neat twists, like the Inverted Spire's quarry of giant whirling blades that comically splat your fireteam. Bosses tend to be huge, tough enemies that cycle through several phases as you deplete their health bar. One hides behind energy shields and snipes you, and you have to defend glowing pressure plates to pierce his defences. They are decent missions, especially when you start taking on their weekly nightfall variants, which introduce time limits, extra elemental damage and other modifiers to increase the challenge. However, Destiny 2's loot systems offer little incentive. The rewards feel slim for the time investment compared to public events.More of these problems emerge as you move towards the end of Destiny 2's levelling curve, and the game settles into a holding pattern. Bungie launches semi-regular week-long events to give you the chance to come back and earn some new gear. In Iron Banner the gravel-voiced hero Saladin invites you to fight in the crucible for his favour. Week-long Faction Rallies also ask you to pledge allegiance to a faction and fight in their name in any Destiny 2 activities with the hope of beating the other factions and earning their special gun. It's a neat idea, and the comings and goings of Trials of the Nine and the weekend vendor Xur, make Destiny 2 feel like a living game. The problem is that after a while most items, especially armour, start to feel like purely cosmetic upgrades.Exotics are the most valuable drops in the game. You can only hold one exotic weapon and wear one piece of exotic armour at a time, and they even come with a few paragraphs of prose that teaches you a bit more about Destiny's dense but fascinating lore. However the four warlock exotic helmets I have all offer inscrutable ability recharge buffs that don't feel as though they change my character at all. The same issue applies to the entire mod system, which lets you slot small upgrades into armour to grow your overall power level and gain minor buffs that might let you reload energy weapons a little faster, or grant you more resilience. As long as your power level is on point, the type of gear you wear barely matters.Weapons are more interesting, especially when they are tuned to specialise in certain situations. Risk Runner become electrically charged when you take electricity damage, for example, so it's particularly good against enemies like the Fallen, who routinely carry electric weapons. Items like this have character and utility that makes them desirable, and Destiny 2 could use more of these at the top level of the game to give Destiny 2's most determined players something to chase.The layers of level values, stats and damage numbers in Destiny can give the wrong impression. Destiny 2 is fundamentally a great shooter slotted into a lightweight levelling structure. Don't expect much in the way of RPG-style character building with skill trees and strong character builds. The three stats that govern your character's speed, resilience and recovery values have a minor effect on moment-to-moment play, but it's not worth worrying much about, and the simplistically organised subclasses leave little room for character customisation. My warlock feels like any other warlock in the game.It's a shame that Destiny 2 runs out of gas in its final stages, but there's a chance that the DLC drops and the promise of reorganised reward structures will make Destiny's multitude of activities relevant again in the endgame. When the supply of spectacular new locations, new bad guys and new guns runs out it's remarkable how those extraneous progression systems—the ladder of incremental damage value upgrades, grinding for drops—becomes the entire focus of the game. I suspect Bungie see the loot system as the means, rather than the end, a way to draw players back together to enjoy social experiences. It comes back to the lifestyle game you want. If you're after an infinite action RPG then Destiny 2 is a few DLC packs and expansions away from that, but if you're after a regular light dose of beautiful sci-fi shooter fun, the perfect post-pub co-op jolly, or the game that will have your fireteam shouting in joy at your monitors when a raid boss goes down, Destiny 2 is a very well-made shooter and one of the best co-op games (opens in new tab) on PC.Gorgeous guns, a glittering universe, and a great port.

Destiny 2,Wesley Yin-Poole,Eurogamer,http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-09-15-destiny-2-review,"World-Eater.Destiny 2 feels like an apology. It is the righting of the wrongs committed by the divisive Destiny 1, a game I couldn't help but pump a thousand hours into despite it often feeling like pulling teeth.The developers at Bungie, with Halo-fuelled egos dented from the mediocre critical reception that enveloped Destiny's delayed 2014 launch, have wiped the slate clean like a raid boss swatting away a troublesome fireteam. This respawned shared-world shooter sequel is the game Destiny 1 should have been, free from frustration, respectful of players' time and inspired in its level design.And yet I can't help but feel Destiny 2 doesn't quite add enough that is genuinely new to the Destiny mix for a sequel that arrives over three years after its predecessor. It's the one glaring issue that prevents Destiny 2 from joining the pantheon of the shooter greats.It is perhaps best to start with what Destiny 2 doesn't do, rather than what it does, so sweeping are its attempts to shove past indiscretions under the carpet. Destiny 2 doesn't tell a terrible story, as Destiny 1 did. The 10-hour campaign is leaps and bounds above the nonsensical mess that came before it. With a light-hearted tone and a handful of likeable characters, Destiny 2 takes the player on an enjoyable sci-fi romp across the solar system fuelled by an angry Cabal who reckons the Travelers's gift of immortality has made the Guardians soft. So he takes it away - and you have to take it back.We visit four brand new areas: what looks like post-apocalyptic Germany; a lost human city on the stormy seas of Titan; the mysterious Vex-infused Nessus; and the sulfuric yellow moon, Io. The story, which is let down by some Syfy z-movie dialogue and a handful of other, more forgettable characters, at least has its beginning, middle and end in the right order. Destiny 1's frankenstein plot couldn't even manage that.Bungie though, still seems to struggle with straight-up storytelling. Cutscenes are packed with eye-rolling exposition, no-one says anything particularly interesting and character development boils down to re-powering the de-powered Guardians - a well-worn trick that doesn't have the impact Bungie would like it to. The theme of mortality bubbles under the surface of Destiny 2's campaign, but it never reaches boiling point. I would love to delve deeper into Ikora's character as she struggles to come to terms with the loss of the light-giving Traveler and her newfound mortality. In the end she, like all the others, seems to have learnt a valuable lesson without having gone to class.What carries you forward is the fact that Destiny, like Halo before it, is the best-feeling shooter around. Guns pack a proper punch and super abilities rock the screen. The simple act of squeezing the right trigger is a joy, the console aim assist caressing the inexorable flow of bullets into the path of heads that pop with a satisfying burst of alien blood, their bodies exploding in a shower of particle effects, glimmer and, if you're lucky, an engram or two.Bungie is the master of tailoring a few minutes of frenetic combat to a fireteam of a few players. Things get hectic enough to require just the right amount of concentration to succeed. Use super powers, throw grenades, hide behind cover, keep an eye on your health bar and fire the right big gun for the job. In between the fighting, follow the waypoint marker ever forward. Destiny 2 is made up of four decently-sized open-worlds, but missions are entirely linear. Go here, activate that, defend this, put this ball in that hole, press forward. It's pretty mindless and nothing that hasn't been done plenty of times before, but it's all so silky smooth it's hard to tear yourself away from the television. Playing Destiny 2 is a bit like driving a brand new Audi along a quiet country road, its engine quietly humming, its steering wheel an extension of your hands.Then a stunning environment, a gorgeous vista or a level twist jolts you out of your comfort zone and all you can do is stand motionless in awe. Bungie's incredible art team has produced its best ever work with Destiny 2, creating a virtual world - well, four of them - that rekindles memories of the science fiction you imagined while reading books as a child.The highlight is the play space on Titan, an abandoned human colony that rests on crashing waves. Inside is the New Pacific Arcology, Destiny 2's best campaign level. Here the tone shifts as we descend deeper into the sinking city's innards, archaic public announcements now kicked back into life, lights flickering, futuristic floors giving way to creepy corridors. You go deeper underground (Bungie loves taking players down, down and down some more) until you grab what's needed and make for a dramatic escape via a surprising vehicle. This is up there with the best of Halo.There's an incredible sense of scale to Destiny 2's environments. The maps are massive, but, crucially, more densely packed than Destiny's and more encouraging of exploration. Eye-catching detail, from weird alien markings scrawled on walls to dimension-ripping portals, is everywhere. And graphically, Destiny 2 is a tour de force that benefits greatly from leaving the last generation of consoles behind. When I first set eyes on the crashed human colony ship on Nessus, its gargantuan rockets jutting out of the ground in the distance, I thought, blimey, this is what 700 developers gets you.Destiny 2, of course, is about so much more than its campaign. It is about loot and how it fuels the improvement of your character. Destiny 1's soul-destroying progression is ditched in favour of a relatively simple levelling up system that involves repeating certain activities on a weekly basis. Bungie has done well to increase the number of activities available compared with Destiny 1, adding variety to the post-campaign game in the process. There are Strikes (missions designed for teams of three players), Adventures (post-campaign story missions), Lost Sectors (multi-tiered mini-dungeons meant to be stumbled upon while exploring) and loads more NPCs to turn tokens into for reputation and elaborate exotic quests to toil over. They're all designed to randomly spit out slightly more powerful weapons and armour than you have currently equipped, and in the medium term at least, satisfy your rabid hunt for a higher power.Then the infamous Destiny grind returns, but it's much less annoying this time around. Like Destiny 1, Destiny 2 takes an average of the power level of each item to determine your overall post light level cap power rating, but this time you don't have to soldier through levelling up each item. This is a huge time saver and much more intuitive.Your power level rises fast after you hit the soft level cap, but progression soon slows as Destiny 2 funnels players through more difficult, endgame activities such as heroic Public Events, the weekly Nightfall strike, the Flashpoint activity and the Crucible. But the point to make here is the process is no longer abstruse. Even zipping about the world is easier. Bungie, clearly inspired by community created-apps that made playing Destiny 1 just about tolerable, marks upcoming Public Events on the map (now there's a map!) and lets you fast travel from anywhere to anywhere (no need to go to orbit first, thank god). These seemingly innocuous tweaks are a revelation for the long-term Destiny 2 experience, and are evidence of a developer that is willing to not just listen to feedback, but do something about it.Bungie has re-tooled the Crucible to feature teams of four rather than teams of six, and separated playlists into easy-going modes and hardcore PvP. It's an overall more strategic experience that seems designed for some sort of esports play. Super availability is clearly signposted at the top of the screen, and the time to kill has been reduced. In some ways, Destiny 2 PvP feels more like Halo than Destiny 1, which is very much a good thing. I'd hoped for meaningful vehicle combat, but alas it's nowhere to be seen. The wait for Destiny's take on the warthog continues...Destiny 2 is also more accommodating of players who might not have friends to play with or a huge amount of time to pump into the game. The Guided Games feature encourages highly-skilled players to help those who need it. Join a clan and you'll get nice purple engrams when your clan-mates complete endgame activities. In short, Bungie has opened up the progression process in clever ways. It still takes time to level up, but it's a more fun time. Destiny 2 is still all about making numbers go until they won't go up any more, but Bungie now officiates the process like a good referee - the fans don't notice because there isn't much to get upset with.Eventually, as your power level creaks towards 300, Destiny 2's raid presents itself. The pressure was on Bungie to outdo Destiny 1's Vault of Glass, which to this day remains one of the finest first-person shooter experiences ever. It hasn't quite managed that, but it has come up with something unlike anything else in Destiny 2, and that's very much a good thing.Leviathan is a golden puzzle box that sits on top of a galaxy-travelling world eater. It is a Terry Pratchett fever dream, a drug-fuelled Prince concert, a tumble up and down an M. C. Escher staircase.Destiny raids should be experienced unspoiled (your first time is always the one you remember), but know this: the Leviathan focuses more on puzzle-solving and execution than it does overwhelming waves of enemies and killing big bosses. It stresses your concentration more than it does your power level. It's as frustrating as it is thrilling.What's fantastic about Leviathan, however, is it makes sense. As you explore its maze-like interior you get the feeling the tunnels and rooms and corridors and were actually worked out in someone's garage on a dusty table with cardboard cutouts. It is consistent. This bit leads to that bit leads to that door that opens if we do that. If there is a list of wonders of the video game world, The Leviathan should be on it.Predictably, microtransactions return for Destiny 2, and they're a bit more problematic than they were in the first game. For one, Bungie points players to the in-game shop, called the Eververse, by handing out Bright Engrams occasionally. Shaders are now consumables, which means they're one-time use for individual pieces of armour. Bungie says this change is meant to encourage gameplay, but it's just annoying. And Eververse sells gameplay-affecting mods,
 which is a worrying start for the store. All this in a full-price game. At launch, I've managed to get on fine without dropping real-world money on in-game currency, but I am concerned that as Destiny 2 evolves, so will the pull of the Eververse.You won't find Zavala or Cayde or Ikora spouting their nonsense on Leviathan. You won't hear relentless exposition out of your plucky sidekick Ghost (who elsewhere in the game never shuts up). Leviathan itself does the talking. It is video game world building at its best. I have given myself over to Destiny lore, which despite the universe's reputation for poor storytelling is fascinating, complex and super cool. I want to know more about the Traveler. I want to know what really happened during the Collapse. I want to know the true nature of the Darkness. My drive to keep up with the Joneses - aka my clan mates - in the loot race is matched only by my desire to learn more about this incredible universe Bungie has concocted. That is very much a good sign for Destiny 2.But Leviathan, for all its sparkling brilliance, does not do enough to elevate Destiny 2 to equal status with Bungie's very best. I just can't get past the feeling this sequel is a hugely successful refresh, but doesn't realise Destiny's potential. It is as good a quality of life upgrade as Bungie could be expected to deliver, with almost every change unequivocally for the better. But where is the new class of Guardian? Where is the new alien race? Where are the six-player fireteam patrols?Perhaps we'll have to wait for an expansion or - gulp! - Destiny 3 for Bungie's Halo killer to achieve true greatness.

Find out more about our reviews policy.Destiny 2 is a very, very different game to the first, but it’s impossible to tell that without playing it. On a surface glance, everything looks the same, albeit rendered with arrestingly greater detail and vitality. Campaign missions. Strikes. Open-world planets. Public Events. PvP. The bullet-point list reads like business as usual. But this is anything but.  Destiny 2’s radically new personality and philosophy are first laid out in its campaign. Where the first game’s many joys were largely systemic, living within its beautifully honed and deliciously malleable combat and character crafting systems, here, that stuff is ‘just’ the core of something much greater. What we have in Destiny 2’s story campaign is almost incomparable to the first game’s narratively-linked series of escalating arena fights and dungeon crawls. It still makes use of such things, of course, as it cuts a path through Destiny 2’s multi-planet open-world. But what we have here is also a full-blooded, immaculately paced, pure FPS campaign, built with all the story, scale, and set-piece insight Bungie perfected over the 13-year period of its pre-Destiny shooter work. Destiny 2’s campaign is a hell of a good Halo game, basically. While we expected the quality of dynamic, emergent, cat-and-mouse gunplay exemplified in the first Destiny to ring loud and true through Destiny 2, in truth this sequel has an even louder pulse. Brought to vibrant life by way of many aggressive, upgraded evolutions to enemy types, AI behaviours, and increasingly imaginative, more freeform weapon design, Destiny 2’s core combat is a constantly surprising, demanding, and exhilarating experience, even to those of us who spent upward of 800 hours with the first game. That it now exists in a campaign framework of far greater ambition, in all areas, from escalation to emotion, makes for an engrossing and at times dizzying experience.The campaign’s last few hours in particular revel in a glorious acceleration of peril, design, ideas and craft. If you need a reminder of why Bungie is such an important studio – hell, if you need a reminder of just why you fell in love with story-driven shooters in the first place – Destiny 2’s campaign is that. With the narrative advantages that come with three years of a persistent, lived-in universe, set upon a raft of background lore than has been studiously pored over for just as long, Destiny 2 nonetheless delivers a story of total immediacy and in-the-moment drama, able to electrify long-term fans without at all leaving newcomers out of the party.But this, to trot out the inverted commas once again, is ‘just’ the in-road to Destiny 2’s wider world. And it is a world altogether more human, direct, relatable, and immersive than it has ever been before. This is Destiny evolved into something brand new, through a combination of warm, emotive, radically expanded character focus and consistently canny construction. I said in one of my early entries in our review diary that Destiny 2 feels like stepping up to Destiny: The Movie. Andy said that it makes the first game feel like a prototype. A couple of weeks later, both of those statements now stand even stronger than they did when we wrote them.A world that at times previously felt like it existed as a description of itself is now a real place, that lives, breathes, and matters. New players will find a fantastic and absorbing universe to play in. To stalwart Guardians, the evolution will be an initially strange experience, but a rather beautiful, oddly profound one as well.But that is, in every sense, just the start.Destiny 2 is such a vast game that I have to break its component parts down individually in order to discuss them, but in truth, Destiny 2’s triumph comes from the fact that they are inseparable. While the campaign is a focused salvo of shock and awe, it rapidly melts and disseminates its influence throughout the open-world. Dense with a steadily expanding, nonlinear array of spin-off story missions (known as Adventures), and later, multi-stage Quest narratives, the world that Destiny 2 builds around its campaign truly delivers the dream of a fully-fleshed, open-world RPG/FPS hybrid.Although spread over four smaller, self-contained planets rather than one vast map, the richness of Destiny 2’s world blends the options and exploration freedom of a Far Cry with the spiralling, free-form, narratively-driven side-quest structure of a Witcher. But just as good as the breadth and depth of the world is its spirit, which ensures that its experiences come without hierarchy. Destiny 2 is a world of vastly different, organically linked experiences, and it resolutely ensures that all of them are worthwhile, both in the immediately gratifying moment and in terms of the long-term journey of loot and character evolution.“This is the idea of Destiny evolved and elevated into something it has never been before”Want perpetual combat and frequent gear drops? The Strike playlist has you covered. But if you wish to potter around at your own pace, exploring side-stories, engaging in dynamic skirmishes, investigating secret areas, and completing challenges and treasure hunts, you can do just as well with that. Destiny 2 is a game that wants you to enjoy whatever you feel like doing at any given time, and it wants you to know that it always approves of your decision. Forget the old days of being mechanically funnelled through specific, ‘elite’ content lists, toward increasingly narrow caches of high-level loot. Destiny 2 is the game you want it to be, whether that’s a rambling, single-player, open-world FPS with a levelling system, a gear-grind focused MMO, a welcoming, co-op hangout, or anything else in between. And for all the wealth of vastly different content that lives in its open-world, it’s the new, stripped-back progress system that really makes everything gel into a single organic whole. Streamlined, simplified, but far more purposeful and empowering than before, Destiny 2’s Token system, which bestows redeemable, universal gear currency for every activity completed in any given area, ensures that every single event enjoyed – from a hardcore, co-operative Nightfall Strike, to a lore-filled, narrative side-quest, to a meandering, solo hunt for the many Lost Sector mini-dungeons and hidden treasure chests – is equally meaningful, pushing you forward with a real sense of control over your experience. Everything is an investment. Nothing is wasted. Everything pays forward eventually, without demand or coercion.  And the way that Destiny 2 reveals its journey, too, is the product of a transformative rethink. Steadily building out the world around its campaign, it quietly introduces its greater scale and possibilities to new players and old alike while holding back any serious hint of the long-term, RPG game until the end of the campaign. All of the big-picture stuff, and the many different ways of tackling it, Destiny 2 leaves until later, bedding each element in a logical narrative off-shoot and ensuring that it only appears at the exact moment the player is ready to embrace it. At times, Destiny 2’s empathy for the player experience is borderline clairvoyant.With such a rich world and a clear-cut progress system, levelling up in Destiny 2 is about feeding and serving the gameplay experience, not the other way around. The basic trading up of gear leads to new means to earn more special gear. That in turn leads to the means to customise and increase the power of that gear, which leads to access to new activities, and further means of customising and empowering. And the bountiful currency fuel for all of this remains constant, arriving in reward for every move you choose to make, with a generosity that will make players of the first game crick their necks in surprise. Unlike the first Destiny, this is not a game about fighting to reach an arbitrary final number, but one concerned with revealing and discovering new ways to play, that in turn create more new ways to play, along whichever of its many paths you wish to take.“This is Destiny set free. It’s Destiny democratised. It’s a warm, human, generous Destiny for everyone”Those paths are paved with design excellence, whichever routes you choose. The combat-intensive Strike missions are now far more than ‘tough levels with boss fights’. Taking inspiration cues from all of the first game’s greatest successes – particularly the experimental, abstract, combat-puzzle extravaganzas of the Raids – Strikes now have unique personality and stand-out demands. A hint of conceptuality even, at times. In one case it might be a boss fight that requires methodical, role-switching, co-operative tactics to best. In another it might be the grand scale of a cinematic, insta-kill obstacle course. Or it might be a dash of darkness-hampered exploration platforming, or a surprisingly dramatic blend of gameplay mechanic and narrative through-line. How to level up fast in Destiny 2 (opens in new tab)This creativity is also rife in the Adventure and Quest missions, which frequently take advantage of their spin-off nature to twist and rework Destiny 2’s gameplay and story beats in some strikingly surprising directions. I’ll spoil nothing, but I will tell you to make sure you absorb everything on the map at some point. The Token system might make it all profitable, but the quality and imagination present make everything thoroughly worthwhile in terms of pure experience.Destiny 2’s Crucible PvP has had as fundamental a rethink as everything else, and has benefitted just as much. With one-hit kills now a rarity – whether they come from scarcely fuelled Power weapons, or super abilities that now require a great deal more nuance to use effectively – and team sizes reduced to four, the chaos that sometimes hampered the first game’s PvP has entirely left the arena.Replacing it is a set-up that really lets Destiny 2’s competitive combat shine in a tight, focused, clear, and tactically co-operative format. Playing with a fully communicative Fireteam is a relentless joy, as intellectually stimulating as it is knife-edge exciting. But even when playing pick-up games with randomly match-made players, the clarity of battle both supports and encourages the drum-tight team tactics that make the new Crucible feverishly compulsive and rewarding.And then, of course, there’s that Raid. Leviathan, the first of Destiny 2’s grandiose, hours-long, six-player combat puzzle dungeons picks up the baton admirably and, although we haven’t finished it yet, has already more than justified its place. At their best, Destiny Raids are - systemically and in terms of team camaraderie - some of the best experiences in modern gaming. Uncompromisingly challenging, and brutally demanding of shooting skills, co-ordination, and lateral, deductive thinking, the process of deciphering and defeating a Raid should deliver a nourishing high and team bonding experience like no other. And while it would be deeply remiss of me to spoil anything – discovery, after all, is the whole point – even by just the third section, Leviathan’s grand, slightly more cinematic take on the Raid format has bestowed all of that in spades. Completing it is our team’s new life obsession, and will remain so until we emerge victorious. At which point we’ll certainly go back in for better gear.And rounding off all of this brilliance are the many quality-of-life improvements marinating the entire Destiny 2 experience. Taking many cues from the ways its community played the first game, Bungie has instilled Destiny 2 with a plethora of over-arching systems that smooth any last hint of pain out of the journey. Clan support lets any player, whether running a packed-out friends list or playing solo, feel part of the community, and share in material rewards for cumulative success on a weekly basis. Guided Gameplay (currently in beta) finally opens the doors to high-level activities for everyone. Can’t put together a six-person Raid team? No problem. Just hook up with a clan taking part in the Guided program, and they’ll embrace you as one of their own for the duration.Looking to farm Public Events for XP and Tokens? Timers on the map (because there is actually an in-game map) will tell you exactly where and when they’re going to occur. And planet-specific challenges – which often dovetail with bigger, weekly Milestone tasks – will amplify their worth, and give you plenty of other profitable activities to engage in along the way.This isn’t Destiny. This is something new. Something bigger, cleverer, richer, and much, much better. It’s the idea of Destiny evolved and elevated into something it has never been before. It’s Destiny set free. It’s Destiny democratised. It’s Destiny really allowed to live. I said at the end of my review of the first game that I was leaving a point off the score to leave space for the game’s potential to grow and improve. This time round, there’s no need. Destiny 2 is already much more than we ever imagined it would be.Bungie ""taking action"" after Destiny 2 community summit leads to big Season 21 leak: ""When that trust is betrayed, it hurts""Destiny 2 joins other big shooters in clowning on third-party device cheatersResident Evil 2 Remake and Resident Evil 3 Remake updates have removed raytracingBy Emily Garbutt7 April 2023By Tabitha Baker6 April 2023By Tabitha Baker6 April 2023By Duncan Robertson5 April 2023By Bradley Russell5 April 2023By Fay Watson4 April 2023By Tabitha Baker3 April 2023By Benjamin Abbott31 March 2023By Tabitha Baker31 March 2023By Emily Garbutt31 March 2023By Tabitha Baker30 March 2023GamesRadar+ is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Destiny 2,Matt Miller,Game Informer,http://www.gameinformer.com/games/destiny_2/b/playstation4/archive/2017/09/15/game-informer-review-destiny-2.aspx,"Bungie took a big chance when it chose to reset three years of progress and start all players, new and returning alike, at ground zero for Destiny 2. The risk has allowed for a reinvention of troublesome systems and a new opportunity for players to climb the level curve, while still maintaining the successes learned across the many updates of the first Destiny. The result is a game that is more accessible, streamlined, and sensible, with a clear through line in both gameplay and story. However, this refined sophomore effort in the Destiny universe comes at the cost of flexibility to play how you want and fully customize the experience as you go. Newcomers to Destiny 2 will discover the same core precepts that have kept others engaged for years. Hundreds of years in the future, humanity’s fate has been reshaped by a powerful alien entity, spreading our reach across the solar system. A later inexplicable collapse has left a scattered people scrambling for survival, guided and protected by deathless Guardian warriors. The fiction seamlessly melds fantasy and sci-fi tropes into a richly imagined setting. Gameplay features remarkably taut FPS gunplay enhanced with seemingly magical powers. Your character grows in power alongside friends that inhabit the same public playspaces, and they join you in all manner of integrated exploits.If the first Destiny introduced the universe, Destiny 2 is the story that begins to make meaningful changes to the status quo. With no mention of a nebulous Darkness to be found, we instead have a game all about Light, a power that sets humanity apart and represents concepts of hope, self-sacrifice, and resilience. That focus on Light and its meaning lends an optimistic tone to the plot. In the wake of a devastating opening in which The Last City is brought to ruin, the Guardians are scattered, and power lost. The dramatic setup leads to a coherent and straightforward tale that spans the solar system, and culminates in several stellar set piece confrontations, including a thoughtfully concocted central villain. Individual missions are varied and smartly paced, and I love that we get some more insight into the minds of our supporting cast.I relished the adventure, but some of the magic and mystery I've come to expect is absent. Some of the most troublesome and cryptic story elements from the earlier game also made its universe feel bigger and stranger, and I'm not sure Bungie has managed to replace characters like the Awoken Queen, or design concepts like the Grimoire, with equally curious alternatives. Most enemy types return from Destiny 1 with only minor alteration, diminishing the disquiet of facing a new threat. I'm also mystified by the decision to lock so much of the story content away after its conclusion, replayable only in prescribed chunks a few times each week. The inability to relive favorite moments outweighs the gains in simplifying the map with fewer icons. Likewise, I'm stymied by the absence of an option to select individual strikes, and their inclusion only as part of a playlist. These excellent small-team cooperative expeditions are great fun, but seem almost relegated to an afterthought following the campaign.Breathtaking environment art and design maintain at least some of the story mystique I was looking for, accompanied by a dizzying and inspiring orchestral soundtrack. Every one of the major sites visited in Destiny 2 is majestic, beautiful, and vast, from a European forest overrun by alien conquerors to a grand underwater city hiding beneath the methane waves on one of Saturn's moons. Bungie creates compelling and intimate battlefields, but also communicates the grandeur of massive, daunting backdrops.The first Destiny offered large open planetary destinations with little narrative context. The biggest change to gameplay is a welcome reorganization of those destinations into compelling spaces for exploration, punctuated by clearly marked sites for blistering battles beside other players. Mini-dungeons called lost sectors provide a sense of discovery. Public events are easy to find, and even feature fun heroic variants for those in the know. And a bevy of excellent new story quests and adventures extend the narrative potential post-campaign, revealing the story of these locations and their characters.Crucible play has been overhauled in substantial ways, and moment-to-moment combat feels more competitive. Teamwork is highly valued in every mode, and encounters take a split-second longer to conclude, with fewer one-shot kill options on the table. I quite like the change, which adds up to more strategic and thoughtful engagements. From the new and intense Countdown game type to returning modes like Control, every Crucible match type demands players move and play in different ways. Yet again, I'm perplexed by the decision to force players into one of two playlists, quickplay or competitive, rather than let them choose their preferred mode. I'm also torn by the move to exclusively four-person teams in PvP; the compact group size demands everyone pull their weight, which is great. But neither three-person strike teams or six-person raid groups can easily transition into competitive play, a symmetry that was ideal in the prior game.If most of Destiny 2 caters to accessibility and ease of play, the new Leviathan raid offers a potent counterpoint. The most challenging cooperative activity is a mechanics-heavy beast of an expedition in which constant communication is necessary, and nearly flawless play is required. The sprawling pleasure palace is one of Bungie’s most intricate and fascinating environments to date, accentuated by a maze of secret passages and hidden chests beyond the main encounters. My biggest issue is with the new reward system, which separates the excitement of new gear from the moment of victory, and doesn’t offer most loot until a full completion. Without the ability to gather much new gear as you progress through, there are few ways to gear up for the next battle. Your choice of Hunter, Titan, or Warlock class shapes the experience, whether exploring as a lone wolf along a moon of Jupiter, grouping up for challenging cooperative challenges like the briskly paced new Nightfall strikes, or trying to hold ground in the Crucible. All classes play well and offer their own avenues to mastery. The reliance on mostly returning subclasses within each of the three is a tad disappointing, but each has been tweaked in purposeful ways. Add in a new and aggressive offense subclass for each, from the aerial superiority of the Dawnblade to the melee-oriented Arcstrider, and you have several thrilling playstyles to explore. Each subclass features two pre-optimized paths. Yet again, it’s a design choice that puts even new players on equal footing with returning players, but the more limited customization options sting.  Progression is smooth from opening to endgame, thanks to an elementary milestone system that always suggests meaningful content to confront, and an in-game map that is easily navigable. A new clan system makes friend groups more important, and offers substantial rewards, even if they also create some danger of insular bubbling with players you already know.  No matter the preferred style of play, collectors are in for a treat. New exotic weapons and armor are joined by welcome revisions of old favorites, and everything from legendary gear to emblems are a lot of fun to gather. Gear comes fully powered now, so you're free to play with the gun or helmet you like, rather than waiting to power it up. Even so, I'm bummed that most items have so few customization options, as I have fond memories of tweaking those as I played in Destiny 1. Vault and inventory management have seen only minor changes, and even in these early days the management chores aren’t much fun. While I love all the collections, the cosmetic customization system has taken a step back, offloading and embedding many of the coolest ships, shaders, and other visual trappings within the microtransaction system alongside a slow-paced alternative to earn the same packages through play. Being able to apply shaders to weapons and vehicles is a great addition, but the system discourages experimentation, since shaders are consumed on use. A rich equipment modding system is also sadly looped in with the microtransactions, diminishing an otherwise compelling power customization tool. A veteran player of any game is likely to home in on criticisms, and there's a danger of getting lost in the weeds, which would be a mistake. Destiny 2 is a massive and rewarding game that offers the potential for hundreds of hours of fun and discovery with friends. Quibbles aside, Bungie has crafted a fantastic follow-up to a wildly popular formula, and one that no other developer has come close to equaling in sophistication. Many of the streamlining choices welcome a new crop of Guardians into the mix, but also make this new game more playable and understandable for even returning players. As I settle in for what I hope to be another several years of adventures, I hope Bungie can nail the elusive balance between depth and accessibility.

Destiny 2,Ryan Gilliam,Polygon,https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22834684/destiny-2-bungie-30th-anniversary-event-grasp-avarice-dungeon-review-halo-weapons,"Filed under:A pirate-themed romp through Bungie’s past headlines the best update of the yearDestiny 2’s Bungie 30th Anniversary Pack is Destiny at its most joyful.2021 has been a quiet year for Destiny 2. For the first year since the series launched in 2014, Bungie hasn’t published a sequel or major expansion for its space-faring looter shooter. The only non-season launch of the year is the Bungie 30th Anniversary Pack. And while it may be smaller (and cheaper) than a traditional Destiny 2 expansion, Bungie’s passion for its own games shines through, turning the package into a delightful celebration to close out Destiny’s quietest year.Polygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences. When we award the Polygon Recommends badge, it’s because we believe the recipient is uniquely thought-provoking, entertaining, inventive, or fun — and worth fitting into your schedule. If you want curated lists of our favorite media, check out What to Play and What to Watch.The Grasp of Avarice dungeon is the star of the update (along with its loot), and the only playable paid content in the pack — the rest of the cash goes primarily to special cosmetics and dungeon exclusive weapons. It’s a pirate-themed lark through the original Destiny’s infamous loot cave. And after running through it multiple times, I can confidently say it’s the best dungeon Bungie has created.To go with its pirate theme, the first fourth of the dungeon is littered with booby traps, leading all the way to the first boss. If there are two doors presented, one of them is going to kill you as soon as it swings open. I’ll never forget watching my teammate get launched into outer space after throwing a random switch on a walkway. It makes failure fun, and ensures I’ll take a backseat every time I bring a new player through, just to see what traps they spring.The dungeon is pure joy — to play for the first time, to run through with a friend, or to adventure in over and over again looking for that perfect loot roll. Destiny often takes itself quite seriously, and it’s earned that, to an extent, as Bungie has really ramped up the storytelling and worldbuilding over the past two years. But the Grasp of Avarice is explosions, and spike traps, and a giant barrel rolling down a hallway. It’s situational fun that you can’t help but laugh at. But the Bungie 30th Anniversary Pack is more than a single piece of content, and the studio’s enthusiasm for its previous work emanates through more than just the Grasp of Avarice. There’s a free event in the pack, a handful of Exotics (one free and one paid), and a load of new cosmetic items. Many of those items and weapons take inspiration from Bungie’s past games, with fan-favorites from the original Destiny, guns and armor from Marathon, and even a big sword from Myth. But the biggest surprise is the inclusion of Halo-themed items.I play Destiny 2 with a lot of Halo fans — most Destiny players I know are well-versed in Bungie’s former IP — and when someone shouted “I got the Battle Rifle” for the first time, it was an almost emotional experience. Of course, it’s not the real Battle Rifle — that would be legally dubious, I’m sure. But it is made by Bungie, so what’s the difference? It feels perfect. It’s a piece of nostalgia I can interact with daily for years to come.These old Bungie weapons are lovingly crafted, with unique perks created only for them. Players usually only get a single unique Legendary a season, but the update is full of them. Using the Forerunner Exotic sidearm, based clearly on the Halo: Combat Evolved Magnum, is some of the most fun I’ve had in Destiny in years. It not only plays on my love for Combat Evolved’s pistol, it’s also a great, new Destiny weapon that’s useful and fun to use.It feels like Bungie’s developers let themselves run free with this release. They mined their previous work for its greatest hits, and selectively brought the studio’s most treasured items into its modern game. And because of this celebration, I’ll be able to have a little Halo with my Destiny for years to come — assuming Bungie doesn’t bring back weapon sunsetting, which it canceled earlier this year. If I want to use my Halo Battle Rifle, Myth Claymore sword, and Marathon shotgun to take down Savathun next February, I can. But it doesn’t feel like a rehash. Yes, it trades on nostalgia, but it’s not a simple cash grab. Bungie has billed the pack as a celebration, and I concur. Bungie could’ve made this pack for the hardcore players that miss some of their favorite, old Destiny Exotics that never got ported to Destiny 2. “It’s got Gjallarhorn, it’s got a new dungeon, hey look, it’s a Halo sword.” But after spending a week with the new content, it feels more like the developers made the 30th Anniversary Pack for themselves. It’s a small distinction, but one that makes a big difference. The passion that comes through is intoxicating, and it permeates the entire package. It makes me care about all of Bungie’s previous work as much as the studio does, even if I only started playing its games with Halo: Combat Evolved.The next time I can sucker a friend or co-worker into playing Destiny with me, the first thing I’ll tell them to buy is the Bungie 30th Anniversary Pack, and I’ll run them through the Grasp of Avarice dungeon. Not because it’ll earn them Gjallarhorn — the series’ most famous weapon — but because it’s the perfect showcase of how special Destiny can be when Bungie’s own passion shines through.  Destiny 2’s Bungie 30th Anniversary Pack was released Dec. 7 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Google Stadia, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.

    Kallie Plagge
   on October 24, 2017 at 1:44PM PDTDestiny 2 is a lot more Destiny. The structure is largely the same, as is the mechanically excellent shooting and satisfying loot grind. But there are a variety of changes both under the hood and throughout your activities that make it a significant improvement over the original and a better experience for more than just the most hardcore players.From the onset, there's an overwhelming amount of stuff to do. The Red War story funnels you through the four areas you can explore, introducing you to each one as you go. At each destination, there's a bunch of optional activities to choose from, including story-like Adventure missions, simple loot dungeons called Lost Sectors that lead to hidden areas of the map, and public events and patrols, which return from Destiny 1. Then, as you progress through the story, you'll unlock the strike playlist and PvP in the Crucible. For a newcomer to Destiny, it can be hard to decide what to do and when.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Destiny 2 Video ReviewThe Red War story missions are less about plot and more about acclimating you to everything there is to see. You'll level up at a pretty steady pace, but there are two level-gated missions that essentially force you to complete Adventures and other activities for XP before you can move on. There's no actual reason for the missions to have level requirements, which can be annoying, but having direction is welcome after Destiny 1's lack thereof. And aside from netting you XP and loot, the semi-hidden Lost Sectors reward exploration while Adventures are filled with lore and interesting details about the world that fall outside of the scope of the main story. If you're burnt out on standard PvE, you can switch to PvP to level up, which requires different gear and skills.The story is enough to serve its main purpose, which is to contextualize the shooting and looting you're doing through it all. Its villain is a derivative conqueror figure with a hunger for power and destruction, and the save-the-world plot is tired. But you don't need to know much to get going except that humanity is in danger, and you of all people have the power to help. The story's strengths lie in atmosphere and side details, like the endearing craziness of the deranged AI Failsafe or the mysteries of the Vex machine race, and that should be fine for the majority of players who see the story as something to rush through in order to reach the high-level ""endgame."" The mournful soundtrack in particular is fantastic, and it carried me through the most basic story beats, even on repeat playthroughs.Like Destiny 1, there's a lot of grinding to be done between finishing the story and moving onto the high-level endgame activities like the Nightfall strike and the Raid. And again like in Destiny 1, the shoot-and-loot feedback loop feels fantastic. The gunplay is still excellent, and being rewarded for your efforts with an even better gun is something worth celebrating. The biggest change is how much quicker it is to increase your Light level--now called Power--with minimal grinding early on. The combat isn't any easier because of it, though, so it simply takes away the Destiny 1-era frustration of running the same few strikes a dozen times before you can move on to literally anything else. Plus, knowing you might get a slightly more fashionable pair of gauntlets from a five-minute public event gives you the kind of instant gratification that will sustain you through to the endgame.There's a decent variety of weapons and gear to find, mostly in random drops. And once you know what gear is desirable, it becomes a fun metagame to hope you'll find it. A favorite around the GameSpot office has been the exotic auto rifle Sweet Business, and though no one has been using it, we had a lot of fun embarking on the quest to get Rat King. You might get lucky and get what you want right away, but for most people, finding a combination of great weapons for both PvE and PvP and gear with abilities that complement them takes some time. As far as customization goes, the Eververse and its microtransactions return, though leveling up after the official level cap grants you the new Bright Engrams that can be redeemed for consumable shaders, emotes, and more (for free). The change to shaders wasn't popular among fans at first, but making them consumable allows for a greater range of customization on different pieces of armor as well as weapons.Some activities and areas are more cleanly or interestingly designed than others, and after a handful of hours, you'll start to identify the ones you love to play again and again and the ones you aren't as fond of. At least two of the Crucible maps are circular in design and essentially funnel you to your death if you aren't paying attention, which can get pretty boring; some areas require a fair amount of platforming, which can vary from tolerable to tedious depending on your class. But others are laid out in all the right ways to be memorable and fun to replay, like the Arms Dealer strike that keeps you running from room to room and preserving your heavy ammo for a series of tanks.Though there's plenty you can do on your own, Destiny 2 is undeniably better as a shared experience. That can come on many different levels; you can work silently with complete strangers to trigger a heroic public event that gets you all better loot, and on the opposite end of the spectrum, you can coordinate with five friends for hours on end to tackle the Raid. You can also join a Clan, which can grant you a number of passive benefits, like legendary gear, as long as someone in your Clan is meeting certain milestones. On top of that, Destiny 2 also introduces Guided Games, where solo players can search for groups who are short one person and willing to help them through difficult endgame activities like the Nightfall or Raid.Success through strong teamwork is absolutely the best part of Destiny 2.Success through strong teamwork is absolutely the best part of Destiny, and the top-to-bottom tweaks and additions in Destiny 2 make it more accessible without dampening your sense of accomplishment. Meeting the level requirement for the Nightfall or Raid and actually completing it are two very different things, and getting in sync with your Fireteam and flawlessly executing a strategy takes a lot of work. The first two Nightfall strikes, for example, both introduced a modifier to the original strike that forces you and your team to coordinate loadouts and stay in constant communication about which weapons and subclasses you're using. You have to figure that out while also shooting waves of enemies and trying not to die. You'll most likely fail, but each failure helps you perfect your strategy incrementally, and the process of collectively achieving that goal is immensely satisfying.At the highest level, the vast and visually striking Raid combines the need for top-tier weapons and gear, picking the correct subclass and loadout based on what your team needs, strong combat skills, and problem-solving as a group. Destiny 2's first Raid, Leviathan, is very, very difficult, and solving its often obscure puzzles can be both rewarding and frustrating. For the most part, each failure teaches you something new, and the GameSpot Raid team actually cheered when we came up with a solid strategy after going in blind. But there was one section in the middle that we struggled to complete even after we figured out what to do conceptually. Of course, this was after about five straight hours of raiding, so fatigue was definitely a factor--but it didn't blend the puzzle-solving part with actual execution as well as the previous sections of the Raid.In true Destiny fashion, if you do something once, you'll probably end up doing it many more times. The difference with Destiny 2 is in the variety and accessibility of what's available, which cuts down on a lot of the frustration associated with grinding. And even after you've leveled up, there's still more you can do, from keeping up with daily and weekly challenges to just hanging out with friends. It's a much stronger foundation than the original had and one that's enough on its own to keep people coming back week after week.Editor's note: Now that Destiny 2 is out on PC, we've put that version through its paces in both solo missions and competitive multiplayer matches. The PC version comes with the usual suite of graphic and control options, and ran smoothly on our test PC built around a GTX 1070. We've since updated the score to reflect our experience across all available platforms.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment"
Destiny 2,Samit Sarkar,Polygon,https://www.polygon.com/2017/9/5/16230016/destiny-2-review,"Filed under:It’s Destiny, with much less bullshitThe evolution of Destiny, like that of many long-term online service games, has been a veritable saga. Three years ago, Bungie launched Destiny amid staggering levels of hype, and the massive canyon between expectations and reality led many people to write off the next big thing that wasn’t. After the trying times of the first two expansions, Destiny came into its own with 2015’s The Taken King, but could never shake the reputation hanging around its neck like an albatross.It’s understandable that Bungie would want to make a full sequel, to leave the baggage of Destiny behind and start fresh. At the same time, of course, Destiny 2 has to relish and reward the relationships that existing players have built with the franchise over the past three years.Catering to newcomers and veterans alike is a tough balancing act. Some longtime players are still mad that all their existing gear, which they earned over dozens or hundreds of hours with Destiny, is gone — narrative justification be damned. And while everyone’s excited about being able to play Destiny 2 on Windows PC, the lack of support for cross-platform characters is frustrating.But that may all end up as water under the bridge. Perhaps the highest compliment I can pay to Destiny 2 is that it makes its predecessor seem even worse in hindsight. I spent nearly 20 hours with the sequel during a preview event three weeks ago near Bungie’s offices in Bellevue, Washington. During my playtime, I repeatedly found myself wondering how I had ever put up with all the nonsense in Destiny. Because most of it is gone in Destiny 2.If you can tell me exactly what happened in Destiny’s campaign — without resorting to Google or the Grimoire, the lore cards that weren’t even in the actual game — then you deserve a prize. The confusing plot barely provided enough of an excuse to fly around the solar system and shoot aliens, while its clunky dialogue was dragged down by an overuse of sci-fi gobbledygook.Bungie’s writers stepped up their game in Destiny’s expansions, and they’ve taken another stride forward in Destiny 2. The inhabitants of Earth have never been in a more perilous position than after the Cabal invasion of The Last City. The surprise attack results in the destruction of humanity’s only safe haven on the planet, and the loss of everybody’s Light — the mystical force gifted by the Traveler that sustains and empowers Guardians and Ghosts.Destiny 2 offers a dizzying array of things to doMuch of the story concerns the nature of the Guardian initiative, with the three class Vanguards going off on their own introspective searches for meaning (along with quests to find a way to fight back against the Cabal Red Legion). So far, the writing has asked weighty questions like what does it mean to be a Guardian, but I didn’t see much of a payoff during the story missions I played. (Bungie stopped us at what seemed to be three-fourths of the way through the campaign.)The effort to save the solar system is the propulsive force behind Destiny 2’s narrative. But it’s almost as important that there’s an actual villain in the story to give a face to the alien invaders. Dominus Ghaul, the Red Legion leader, has an inferiority complex to match his imposing figure. Confounded by the Traveler’s decision to give its Light to humans — inferior beings, in his eyes — Ghaul attacks the giant white orb and takes the Light by force. Of course, nobody thinks they’re the bad guy, and the cutscenes involving Ghaul do a good job of explaining his motivations beyond wanting to extinguish life on Earth.I don’t want to oversell the story here; it’s a standard sci-fi tale with familiar tropes and roles. But it provides a suitable framework to explain what you’re doing in the campaign. There are strong characters among old friends and new faces alike, and you learn about Destiny’s universe as you get to know them in cutscenes and mission dialogue. This applies whether you’re an existing fan or a new player; the dialogue differs to account for that.Outside the campaign, the four destinations’ individual hosts anchor open-world activities on the respective worlds. Each of these characters has their charms, but the best one is Failsafe. As the only survivor of a Golden Age-era shipwreck on Nessus, Failsafe is an AI with a split personality — alternately friendly and sarcastic. (“Seems like you met my new friends: Failsafe, and her evil twin, Failsafe,” Cayde-6 says.) She’s kind of like a more helpful version of Portal’s GLaDOS, and it’s tremendous fun to hear her interact with Ghost.Failsafe and her cohorts are characters that you can walk up to in Destiny 2’s open world, which is another feature that somehow didn’t exist in the original game. Destiny had problems galore, but most of the game’s issues stemmed from a fundamental lack of content. In order to level up, players had to repeat the same few activities ad nauseam (and the activities themselves lacked variety or excitement).During the event, we all spent about three hours playing competitive multiplayer matches in Destiny 2’s Crucible. The game’s new modes are some of my favorite additions.In Countdown, which was available in the beta, the defenders must try to kill their opponents before the attackers can set one of two charges — and must defuse a charge if it has been set. The Survival mode is a thrilling elimination-style offering in which each squad starts with a shared pool of eight respawn tickets. Once the members of a team use up those lives, they can no longer respawn. There’s nothing like a Survival round coming down to the last Guardian standing on each side.It’s hard to tell, but the maps didn’t seem appreciably smaller despite Destiny 2’s lowered player count of four-on-four Crucible games. The change might have been intended to make gametypes like Control feel more dynamic, but in the limited time I spent with it, the opposite was true. Covering three capture points with four people is a challenge, especially if your opponents have built up a big lead. Either way, this is another area of Destiny 2 where we’ll have to see how things shake out over time.Destiny 2 offers way more (and more varied) open-world activities than its predecessor, and they provide a steady stream of useful loot. Patrol missions have largely been supplanted by two new activities — Adventures and Lost Sectors — while Public Events now play a much larger role.Adventures are the new side missions, and they serve as an elegant way to convey backstory and contextualize the campaign. Lost Sectors are semi-hidden areas in the world, denoted with a recognizable piece of graffiti that looks like a prehistoric cave painting of a tunnel. While it’s possible to repeat them and get loot each time through, I found myself wanting more. Calling them dungeons is a bit of a stretch: None of the ones I played were any more difficult than shooting all the enemies until they were dead.Thankfully, I got plenty of challenge and excitement out of Destiny 2’s Public Events, which are my favorite open-world activity so far. Each one presents a unique problem to solve, so it’s rarely as simple as shooting anything that moves. Every Public Event has a tougher “Heroic” difficulty level that’s unlocked by completing a hidden objective. In Destiny’s expansions, Bungie often relegated these more complex mechanics and challenges to dedicated areas. It’s smart for Bungie to have layered them directly into Public Events here.Public Events aren’t just more interesting in Destiny 2. The game’s new speed-focused interface makes it much easier to do them. There’s now an in-game map — another baffling omission from Destiny — and it highlights Public Events in real time, so you’ll know exactly where and when to expect them. This is a crucial design change. Even if you happened upon a Public Event in Destiny, you might’ve failed to complete it if you weren’t a one-person army. Taking the guesswork out of tracking Public Events should encourage Destiny 2 players to congregate around them, which will likely increase the chances that a group of Guardians will be around to team up to take on the challenge.It’s also easier to get around using the map, thanks to landing zones for fast travel and a waypoint system that lets you mark locations and activities. (I remain confounded, however, by Bungie’s decision to keep Sparrows locked behind random drops in Destiny 2.) These kinds of quality-of-life improvements make a huge difference in the experience of playing Destiny. They eliminate much of the busy work that was inherent to the original game, and they keep you from feeling the need to go outside the game for third-party tools like a Public Event tracker.Aside from the kinds of exercises you’ll repeat, Destiny 2 offers some brilliant one-off activities. One of the highlights of my sessions was the side quest in which I unlocked the Gunslinger subclass for my Hunter. Sure, you feel awesome when you get to unleash the Golden Gun super attack at the end. But the journey is just as great, with storytelling that makes you feel like you’re becoming one with the Hunters. (Destiny veterans will be thrilled to hear that they can also unlock The Taken King’s subclasses — Nightstalker Hunter, Stormcaller Warlock and Sunbreaker Titan — in Destiny 2.)Doing these types of activities will earn you reputation with various allies, and it’s a great way to get regular rewards. More importantly, it’s fast. It took forever to grind faction rep in Destiny, but I earned enough EDZ Tokens for Devrim Kay to award me a bright engram within just a few hours of doing open-world activities in the European Dead Zone on Earth. That doesn’t include strikes, which I couldn’t get around to trying in the time allotted during the event.Destiny 2: Everything you need to knowBy the end of the preview event, my lady Hunter had reached the level cap of 20 with a power of 211. (Your Guardian’s gear level is still a weighted average of the stats on your weapons, armor and class items, but in Destiny 2 it’s called “power” instead of “Light.”)In the original Destiny, the consensus held that the game didn’t really begin until the post-20 grind — the campaign was just a (thin) excuse to get you to that point. That’s not quite the case in the sequel, since there is plenty to do before you ding 20 (including a lengthy campaign with a worthwhile story.) But after level 20 is still where the rubber will meet the road in Destiny 2.Bungie told me that finishing the campaign will unlock a bunch of new activities and pursuits. And the game’s reward economy in missions and open-world settings seemed well-tuned, regularly providing me with meaningful loot that raised my character’s power level. In addition, you receive a bright engram each time you rank up past level 20. They’re a lot more valuable than Motes of Light, the equivalent reward in the original Destiny.But while I have some sense of what I’ll be doing after I hit level 20 in Destiny 2, I don’t know if that grind will feel fun. The heart of Destiny is repeating endgame activities so you can get high-level rewards, either by earning enough in-game currency to buy them from vendors or by earning loot drops. That phase of Destiny was a pain because of the way Bungie structured the gear system and reward economy. It doesn’t seem like those issues will plague Destiny 2, but at this point, I can’t say for sure because I haven’t had the chance to see the endgame.I also didn’t get to play around with some of Destiny 2’s new systems for tweaking gear, like weapon modifications. You can get mods as loot drops or from bright engrams, and they’ll allow you to do things like alter the damage type on an energy weapon. Infusion works differently now: It requires Legendary Shards, and the number of shards needed depends on the rarity of the gear involved. That all sounds fine on paper, but we’ll have to see the systems in action to evaluate them.At the very least, what I’ve played of Destiny 2 is an incredibly promising start. In plain English, it feels like Destiny without all the bullshit. It seems like the sequel Bungie needed to make — not a fundamentally different experience, but improved enough over its predecessor to reel veterans back in and attract people who skipped the original Destiny. Now we have to see how it holds up.For much of its 10- to 12-hour length, I was enjoying Destiny 2’s campaign just fine. I might’ve described it as “well-made,” the kind of adjective you use when you recognize something as a quality product but find yourself unmoved by it. Writing improvements aside, the missions tended to run together in my mind except for a few standout sequences.That all began to change around the midpoint of the campaign, a few missions before the point at which Bungie stopped us during the preview event. As the Vanguard began to uncover the true nature of the threat Ghaul presented, the missions became more closely tied to the story. The back half of the campaign gets steadily better as you progress, and the last third is spectacular, with memorable setpieces for the final two missions: a superweapon near Mercury, and an attempt to take back Earth from the occupying Cabal. In the former, I gawked at the blinding sun whenever I wasn’t trying to avoid its searing heat; in the latter, I finished the fight when my comrades could not.Destiny 2’s underdog story works because it operates on a relatable level, a human level. For three years, Destiny players heard tall tales of the class Vanguards’ exploits, but we didn’t see those three legendary Guardians in action, and thus couldn’t understand why they were special. Here, it was thrilling to watch Cayde-6, Commander Zavala and Ikora Rey (plus Suraya Hawthorne, the liaison between humanity and the Vanguard) operate as a fireteam in an act of true heroism. And it felt awesome to work with them to defeat Ghaul — our success wouldn’t have been possible without everybody doing their part.Finishing the campaign unlocks, well, the rest of the game. As I said in my review-in-progress, nobody cared about the original Destiny’s campaign, partly because the game really began once you hit the “soft cap” at level 20. That’s still true in the sequel, even if its campaign is miles better. In fact, there’s so much you can’t do until you take down Ghaul that it almost feels like Bungie locked away all that content in an effort to make the post-campaign part of Destiny 2 seem bigger and more involved than it actually is.I finished the campaign at a power level of about 210. At that point, there are still a bunch of Adventures and other quests that you’re not strong enough to attempt. Destiny 2 is either very smart about scaling up the difficulty of activities as you get stronger, or I just happened to be doing Public Events in regions with tougher enemies. Either way, it was blessedly rare that I found myself vastly under- or overpowered. The activities in question, though, mostly consist of strikes and Public Events; you’ll be farming them nonstop to get your character up around 260 power. As a Destiny veteran, I was hoping for more variety in this segment of the sequel, and I suspect I’m not alone among people who played the original game. (You can also gear up by playing PvP, if you like; it’s not my thing.)To be clear, there is undeniably way more to do in Destiny 2’s post-campaign phase than there ever was in vanilla Destiny. And what’s there is more engaging and fun, unlike the drudgery that players of the original game dealt with. But so far, I’m already feeling a little tired of the grind needed to get ready for the raid — even if Destiny 2’s quality-of-life improvements make it much less annoying.One of the larger chunks of Destiny 2 that we’ve not yet explored in this review is competitive multiplayer, and the surprising level to which it has changed from the original game.Destiny 2’s PvP is much more team-centric than Destiny’s ever was. Lone-wolfing your way through matches is no longer viable, mostly due to the fact that instant-kill weapons are not readily available. The bulk of your attacks will come from your energy or kinetic weapons, both of which take much longer to kill enemies than the weapons in the first game did. The end result? The only way to take down enemies quickly is with intense communication and cooperative shooting of the same target.This makes playing Destiny 2 PvP with friends a much more engaging experience. Even in deathmatch variants you’re constantly having to call out radar pings and instructions to friends, granting your team a tactical edge over your foes. Smaller maps and team sizes (lowered from six in Destiny to four in Destiny 2) make communication a lot more manageable.This major change has ups and downs. As is often the case across modes in Destiny, if you’re playing with friends, PvP is much more fun. But if you happen to be playing solo, Destiny 2 PvP is a generally miserable experience. Sure, you can attempt to follow your team of voiceless strangers, but even a small squad of two or three on the other side will dominate. Destiny 2 has plenty of one-person activities, but until solo-only matchmaking or free-for-all modes get added, lone wolves will be happiest sticking to PvE.As with any Destiny release, the end goal of Destiny 2 PvE is the raid. Set on a comically enormous Cabal ship called the Leviathan, the raid follows the same format as previous Destiny raids. Six players must complete extremely complex cooperative tasks, fighting various bosses and solving puzzles along the way.Destiny 2’s raid looks unlike anything we’ve seen in the series before. Clearly inspired by Roman architecture, the Leviathan is filled with bathhouses, pleasure gardens and, well, vice. Compared to the often gloomy, post-apocalyptic cities and barren landscapes of the rest of Destiny 2, the bright, gold-coated halls of this ship are a breath of fresh air. It’s much more visually welcoming than previous raids, which is great for people who have been scared off from even attempting one.Those brave souls who are new to Destiny raiding will find Leviathan’s learning curve to be a little more forgiving than those of past raids, too. The initial combat encounter outside is not too hard to piece together on your own. A section in the aforementioned baths is also relatively manageable with a focused team.Unfortunately, things go south from there.Without delving deeply into spoilers, one of the encounters in Leviathan is heavily centered around stealth. You know what Destiny is terrible at? Stealth. Always has been. And yet, Bungie crafted a large chunk of this raid around not being seen by AI that, frequently, does some really dumb, unexpected things. On paper the encounter is ambitious and unique, but in practice it’s a frustrating trial by fire that will discourage most of the people who attempt it.The stealth sequence is a shame, as the encounter that comes after it is spectacular, a wild neon game show that ends in a breathtaking team-wide race to the death.That brief sojourn into hilarious fun is once again dashed by the raid’s last encounter, which, as of this writing, needs a lot of work. Unreliable bugs make the final battle in Leviathan obnoxious, even for the most coordinated teams. Like the conclusions of Vault of Glass, Crota’s End or King’s Fall upon their debuts, it’s prone to breaking in unexpected ways. If a game is going to demand precision from its player base to succeed, players should expect the same from the developers who made it. Leviathan is just not at that level.As an overall product, Destiny 2 is an incredible feat. Bungie spent three years essentially beta-testing this game, and used the knowledge gained from its predecessor to improve and fine-tune just about every aspect of the experience. As with the original, there are still rough patches to pave over, but the astoundingly fun game here is beautiful, funny, varied and constantly rewarding to play. The first Destiny was a game that we played and enjoyed often in spite of itself; with Destiny 2, Bungie has crafted something that’s genuinely worth the time, especially if you’ve got a few dedicated friends willing to join you.Destiny 2 was reviewed using final “retail” downloadable PlayStation 4 codes provided by Activision.

Destiny 2,Kirk Hamilton,Kotaku,https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-kotaku-review-1818530629,"As I struggle to fall asleep after a night of Destiny 2, the game keeps running through my mind. It’s like getting a song stuck in my head: I see the flash of combat and feel the rumbling controller in my hand. But I rarely hear the sounds of battle. Instead, I hear voices.They aren’t the voices of gruff Commander Zavala or wiseass Cayde-6, nor any other characters from Destiny’s roster of stalwart heroes and fantastical machines. They’re the voices of the people I play with: Disembodied chatter coming through my headphones, people comparing notes, complaining, strategizing and bickering, struggling to find a collective purchase on this great big game we all play.Sometimes, I imagine voices of my own. The characters in these stories aren’t real, but they could be.$70 off these best-in-class wireless headphonesGizmodo reviewed them and declared them to be “annoyingly incredible.""“You didn’t play the first Destiny, right?” asked Alex from across the table. She knew the answer, but it still seemed polite to ask. Sean shook his head.“So you basically spend your time shooting aliens. That’s the game. It’s a first-person shooter, you run around and shoot aliens, and you get better guns and armor and whatever. Then you shoot more aliens, and you get better stuff. It’s a loot game like Diablo, so the gear you get is random. And that’s the treadmill, right? The game gives you new stuff slowly, so you always feel like you have a reason to play.”They were at the Three Cats on Pacific, and happy hour was about to end. Alex hadn’t asked Sean to meet her here to sell him on Destiny, exactly, but she had thought about how cool it’d be if he started playing. She had maintained a few regular Destiny friends back when the first game had come out, but they’d faded over the past year or so. There hadn’t been enough to keep everyone coming back. She’d seen how often Sean was online, usually playing Overwatch or Rocket League. He clearly didn’t have a life. He was perfect.“There’s also a lot of backstory, if you want to get into that, though the game doesn’t really bog you down with it. You play as a Guardian, which is basically a sci-fi zombie warrior. You got resurrected by a little robot called a Ghost, and that’s why you can’t die. It’s funny, it’s like, the entire plot of Destiny 2 centers around the fact that your character has the ability to resurrect after dying. So your character’s main superpower is that they’re a video game character. They can die over and over again, while everyone else can only die once.”Alex realized she was getting sidetracked. It was a classic mistake: never open with lore. She’d read a lot of the grimoire from the first game, and knew an unhealthy amount about the events undergirding Destiny’s  many sketched-out folk tales. She’d read the Hive Books of Sorrow, and remembered the tale of Oryx and his sisters better than she remembered most of the classic lit she’d read in high school. Sean wasn’t ready for that yet, though, and it wasn’t like Destiny required knowing this stuff to enjoy it. Better to ease him in.“It’s a sci-fi post-apocalypse, basically.” Alex tried to signal their waiter, who passed by for a second time without making eye contact. She was short, and she’d made her peace with that. Waiters never noticed her. “It’s the future, and this huge, moon-sized mystical sphere called the Traveler shows up on Mars. It unlocks all these technological secrets, and humanity becomes super advanced in just a few years. They start colonizing the solar system, human lifespans triple, that kind of thing. Then this evil force called ‘The Darkness’ turns up to ruin everything. The Traveler sacrifices itself to protect the humans. And it works, the Darkness is vanquished, but the Traveler is dead, too, so everything kind of goes to shit. As the Traveler dies it creates the Ghosts, those little robots, and they each get assigned to a Guardian, who’ll protect humankind now that the Traveler isn’t around to do it. And that’s the setup.”Sean started to reply when, over his shoulder, Alex saw the waiter approaching. She stuck her arm straight in the air and waved emphatically; no way he could miss her this time. Success! He gave her a nod and a “one second” gesture, then passed by on his way back to the bar. She craned her neck to try to see what he was doing, then gave up and turned back to Sean.“So I don’t need to have played the first game?” he asked.“Nah, not really,” said Alex, looking down at her empty glass. The napkin stuck to the bottom and had gone nearly transparent. “Maybe read a recap online or something, but you can just start this one fresh. Basically, in the first game you fought off a bunch of aliens and then everything was fine. At the start of the second game, a bad guy named Ghaul turns up with an army and totally destroys everything. He invades the last city on Earth, where the Guardians had set up their base, and puts a big net over the Traveler. You lose everything you built in the first game and have to start from scratch. The story is about rebuilding from nothing; it’s self-contained. And it’s pretty good, you know, for a big dumb space action game.”“I always see people making fun of Destiny’s story,” Sean said with a grin. “But yeah, I dunno, I liked Halo’s story, or at least, the first couple games. Same people made it, right?”“Oh, well, it’s a lot like Halo, actually!” Alex smelled blood. She hadn’t known Sean liked Halo. “Destiny 2 is way more Halo-like than the first game. Especially toward the end of the story. There’s some big set-piece battles, tanks and vehicle segments, and actually a lot more jokes and humor than Halo even had. And the music is really great, it’s definitely got those Halo vibes. Plus we could play together! I mean, that’s my not-so-secret plan, to get you to play. It really helps to have a clan in this game, and I dunno, I mean, you and I actually live in the same city, we’re in the same time zone… I think it’d be fun!”Sean leaned back in his chair. He didn’t immediately respond, but he looked thoughtful. Alex watched the waiter making his way to their table.“Fuck this captain and his teleporting… I can’t… fuck! God damn it!” Peter shook his controller in dismay as his screen went grey. He heard the announcement, “Guardian Down,” as it echoed through his teammate Javi’s speakers, back through Javi’s headset, and into their party chat. As usual, Javi needed to turn his fucking TV down.“We’re screwed. It’s my turn to be doing damage, I had my super, and I’m fucking dead.” Peter, Javi, and their third teammate Andrew had been at it for four hours now, desperate to complete the quest for a gun called The Rat King. As far as any of them could tell, this was the hardest mission in the game. It required them to beat a timed high-level “strike” mission with at least five minutes left on the clock. After four hours, the best run they’d managed was still 90 seconds too slow.“Don’t worry about getting me up, just focus on clearing enemies,” said Peter, dejectedly. He knew he needed to work on his attitude, especially in moments like this. When things started going south, he had a tendency to get dark, and that shit was contagious. It was just a video game. Not just any video game, it was a sequel to Destiny! He’d played hundreds of hours of the first game, more than he ever thought he’d devote to a single game. Plus it was Saturday, and he had nowhere else to be. He muted his mic, took a deep breath, and looked out the window. It was a beautiful Midwestern September afternoon. Next door, a big guy in an undershirt was getting ready to fire up a leaf blower. Peter turned back to his TV just in time to see Javi bite the dust. The clock kept ticking.“Let’s just start over,” he said. “That wasn’t a bad run, I just screwed up and got too aggressive. Let’s take a minute to regroup.” Javi and Andrew assented, and Paul pulled them out of the activity.“I’ll be right back,” Javi said, “I think my food’s here.” A light click as he muted his mic.“Man… this game.” Peter didn’t know Andrew all that well; he was a work buddy of Javi’s that he’d played a bit with over the last couple of years, but they’d never met in person or found much to talk about when they weren’t playing. “Sometimes I really hate it, even though I love it. I’m looking through my gear right now and it’s wild to think about how much stuff they’ve fixed.”This was a favorite pastime of Peter’s, usually when he and some members of his party were waiting in orbit for others to get ready to play. He’d start going through all the arcane things hardcore Destiny-heads like him had previously memorized that had been streamlined out of the sequel.“Remember how we used to have to go to orbit every time we wanted to change activities? Or how we had to keep multiple sets of gloves depending on which gun reloading perk we wanted?”“It’s pretty dumb,” drawled Andrew. “Like how we used to have to level a new gun up before we could use it.” Where was Andrew from again? Peter couldn’t place the accent, though he was pretty sure Andrew had told them at some point. West coast time, he thought. It always felt awkward, asking a Destiny friend where they were from. Like you were asking for their phone number, or to be Facebook friends.“Yeah! They’ve made the game so much friendlier,” said Peter. “Like how all the currencies work. Pretty much everything I collect has one use, so I don’t have to hoard stuff or wonder if I’m gonna regret spending it. I turn in tokens to each vendor, and if I turn in enough tokens, I get an item. I break down stuff I don’t want and turn the parts in at the gunsmith, and get more items that way, too. It’s so much simpler.”“Well, the microtransactions,” said Andrew.“Well, yeah.” Peter knew microtransactions, which got you cosmetic items in exchange for real money at the in-game “Eververse” store, were a sore spot for a lot of Destiny players. It wasn’t too bad now, since he didn’t care much about cosmetics. But the minute they started selling limited-time items for actual cash, things would probably get ugly.“The Eververse is just… I guess I just avoid it. I get why they would want to put microtransactions in the game, I just hope it doesn’t become a bigger deal once timed events start. Everything else, though, good shit. I guess the first Destiny added so much stuff over the years that it makes sense they’d take the opportunity to whittle it back down. I hope the same thing doesn’t happen with Destiny 2. Like, I hope they’ve got a clearer plan for how it’ll evolve over time.”“Yeah,” said Andrew. “Also would’ve been nice if they’d introduced a new alien race. We’ve been fighting the same enemies for three years.” He started to say something else, but Javi unmuted his mic and drowned him out.“Okay, sorry about that. Food guy got here.” Once again Peter could hear the TV coming over Javi’s microphone. “I’m gonna have to eat while we play, but I’ll just mute myself.”“How about while you eat, we go through our strategy again.” Peter started talking through their plan of attack. With the clipped drone of someone repeating instructions for the dozenth time, he listed off movement patterns and timed assaults, each a component of a frighteningly rigid routine they’d perfected over the last few hours. Well, not perfected. If they’d perfected it, they would’ve beaten the fucker by now.When Peter felt frustrated by Destiny, as he was now, he tried to look on the bright side. He focused on how unusual it was to play a game that asked this much of its players. They weren’t bad at Destiny, so there had to be a reason they’d spent so much time hitting their heads against this quest with such limited success. Sometimes it was just a demanding game. Rough going now, but Peter had been playing Destiny long enough to know that eventually they’d work something out. And when they did, the sweetest reward would be knowing that they’d they’d never have to do this stupid quest ever again.“Did you see that? Did you see that?” Wake leaned forward in his chair, looking directly at the camera. “This shit is OP! Nerf this!” He was laughing so hard he couldn’t breathe. “I gotta take a break… I gotta… it’s too much.”His aunt still called him Lucas, but to a couple hundred thousand Twitch subscribers, he would always be known as Wake. He’d been entertaining viewers since the first Destiny launched in 2014, back when his life was normal and no one cared what he thought about much of anything. He’d started out posting Destiny gun reviews on YouTube, then realized that he was good enough at shooters that people would actually tune in to watch him play. He started up a Twitch channel and his viewership quickly climbed. One minute he’d been finishing up school and planning a move from Orlando to L.A., the next he had a couple thousand people spending their Sundays watching him throw grenades at aliens. He stopped going to classes, moved out of his cousin’s apartment and into his own place. It had actually been a whole process, but looking back on it now, it seemed like it had happened all at once.When it came to Destiny, Wake prided himself on being first. His clan got known when they were the first to clear the Vault of Glass raid back when it launched with the first game. It took their six-man team ten hours, which he actually hadn’t been expecting. They’d almost been the first to go undefeated in the debut Trials of Osiris competitive tournament, but were foiled by some kid DDOSing them just ahead of their eighth win. The perils of livestreaming video games. Nowadays Destiny raids and Trials runs were more of a known commodity. There had been three more raids since the Vault of Glass, and Wake’s clan had placed somewhere in the top five for each one. For Destiny 2’s new raid, they’d only just made the top ten. No big deal. It was a whole new game, and there were still a lot of firsts on the table.Wake’s crew was planning to raid more this weekend, but for now, he and three of his clanmates were screwing around in Destiny’s competitive Crucible. It was the four of them versus four opponents, and as usual, they were dominating. Wake had just gone on a killing spree with Uriel’s Gift, an auto-rifle that was quickly gaining popularity among top Destiny 2 players. The “meta,” a term for the guns and gear that most players agreed were the best, was always a hot topic for streamers like Wake. What was the meta? Was the meta stale? Which past meta was best? Destiny 2 had barely been out a week, and the new meta hadn’t yet taken form. Always an exciting time.“Somebody save a highlight of that,” said Wake, still laughing. “I’m putting that one on my wall behind me. I don’t know how. I’ll figure it out.” The team they were facing had been better than most of the kids they’d run across this morning, and he hadn’t been expecting to get any highlight-reel clips. People still didn’t expect a flank, was the thing. Destiny 2 rewarded team-play to the point that most teams would move around in a big blob of four, but they’d wind up all looking in the same direction. Wake had taken advantage of that, coming around the side and gunning down three fourths of their team before they even realized he was there. But that fourth guy… that one was the kicker. With his health in the red, Wake rushed his last opponent and desperately pitched a Hunter throwing knife, switching to his sniper rifle and firing without aiming down the sights. He didn’t know why he switched to his sniper; just had a feeling that it’d work. Somehow the knife landed, along with his bullet. The rest would be easily reviewable in slow-mo on his YouTube channel by the end of the day.On the monitor next to his game screen, chat was going haywire. A litter of emoji confetti and all-caps exclamations blew past, too fast to read. Wake played it up a bit more for the camera, holding his hands above his head, then slumping down in his chair. “Take us to orbit, take us to orbit.” It was time for a break.As chat settled down, Wake looked through chat for some viewer questions. Destiny 2 hadn’t been out that long, and most of his subscribers hadn’t had as much time to play as he had. He’d been hitting the game 16 hours a day since it launched, and most people with a straight job or classes to attend just couldn’t keep up. He was here to show them what they wouldn’t see on their own.“What do I think of the new PvP?” He read a question off the screen. “I mean, I like it. You guys all know I like it. It’s definitely more fun with a team. You gotta work together. I like how they lowered the team sizes from six to four, though I was skeptical during the beta. Four is actually a pretty good number. Small enough that everyone makes a difference, but big enough that you don’t feel like you’re solo all the time. It’s way harder to kill another player now, so you gotta work as a team. Fewer hero moments, which maybe is bad for streamers like me, ha ha. But hey, that was a hero moment just then, right?”Wake’s doubts about Destiny 2’s PvP actually went deeper than he let on. He used to get a lot of traction with kill montage videos, which he spent hours carefully editing to show only his most impressive sniper shots. This new game was so much more grounded, and montage material had been harder to come by. On top of that, there were no custom matches for him and his clan to mess around with. And there was just one competitive playlist on most days, which meant he couldn’t even choose which game type he was going to stream. Team games made it harder to be a star, and Wake needed to be a star.He scanned chat for another question. “Am I gonna switch to PC when that version comes out? Come on, guys, always with this question... I don’t know. Maybe I’ll play on both.”[In the channel: Peter, Javi, Andrew][Peter is typing]Peter: So let’s talk this through. The raid hit yesterday. We gotta get a group together. I’m pretty happy with how we did on Rat King, so I think we three should do it. If you guys are into it we need three more to get to six.Javi: yeah, I’m def in. My roommate’s got a class on Friday and I told her I’d need the living room, so I’m good to go late. I can start at 6 eastern, if that works?Andrew: I’m in. I know a couple people I was gonna ask. Cool if I add them?Peter: Yeah, do it[Alex and Sean have entered the channel][Andrew is typing]Andrew: Alex and Sean, meet Peter and Javi. Alex is an old Destiny hand, she got Sean to start playing.Peter: Hey guysAlex: Hey guys!Javi: Nice to e-meetchaSean: HowdyAndrew: You guys said you’re free to raid on Friday, we were thinking 6 eastern. That work for you?Alex: 6pm works. Also fwiw, Sean is totally new to raiding. I told him he’d be fine but I think he’s kinda skeptical. I’m running warlock, power level is 284 with all my best stuff on. I think Luke Smith tweeted that the raid would be 260-280, so that should be fine?Peter: Cool! Sounds like 6pm works for everyone. Yeah, I’m at 282-5 depending on my gear, and I feel like that’ll be fine. Sean, you’re gonna have a good time. I’m sure Alex already told you, but the raid is kinda like a strike, only it’s for six people and it’s way more complicated. You have to work through a bunch of challenge rooms and figure out how to beat each one. They’re usually pretty complicated. It took us like a week to beat the Vault of Glass in D1, but it was one of the coolest things I’ve ever done in a video game. If that sounds good (and your power level is high enough) let’s do it!Sean: Yea I’m power level 267 or something, I think, I’m playing as a titan. I’m excited and kind of scared, sorry in advance if I ruin everythingAlex: He’s just being modest, he’s actually really good. He and I have been doing strikes all week and even doing some PvP, he’s totally carrying his weightPeter: Oh also we all want to go in blind and figure things out for ourselves, so no reading spoilers or watching walkthroughs or whatever!Alex: No worries, I did the same thing with D1, gotta raid blindSean: So all I need is to not know what’s going on? I can handle that lolPeter: haha great. That gives us five for the raid, anybody got a sixth?Sean: I know a guy, Will, from high school. I saw he kept liking destiny stuff on facebook, so apparently he plays. I don’t know if he played the first game. I’ll hit him up and let you know. 6PM Friday?Peter: 6pm Friday.“I can only say it so many ways. Things with us just weren’t working out. He’d gotten mean, and I had to go.” Will pinched his phone between his ear and his shoulder, which allowed him to talk while keeping both hands on his game controller. On the TV across the room, he was about to blow up a giant six-legged spider-tank somewhere in the European wilderness. White damage numbers popped off of the tank every time he opened fire.He and his sister were talking for the fifth time in as many days. The subject of their call, as ever, was Will’s recent decision to end things with his longtime partner Michael. She still sounded unconvinced. She’d really liked Michael, and was actually a little weirdly invested in their relationship, Will thought.“I feel like you’re asking me to convince you, when I really just need your support,” Will said. “He wasn’t good for me for a lot of reasons. You weren’t there.” Will was splayed out on the couch in sweat shorts and an old high school tennis t-shirt. He glanced around his sublet, an overpriced haven after an abrupt departure from his and Michael’s downtown apartment. The woman who normally lived here didn’t really believe in interior design. Will had left a lot of his stuff behind, but his PS4 and laptop had made it out with him. Thank god for that; he had something to focus on aside from his failed relationship.“Can we just not talk about Michael for a minute? How are you, how are the kids?” His sister started talking about how Will’s niece and nephew were doing in school, and he found his attention drifting back to the TV. The tank still had half its health left; maybe there was some secret to this fight that he hadn’t figured out? He had the TV muted, but he was starting to worry his sister would hear his controller vibrating. It was louder than he’d realized. A few more shots and he finally did enough damage to stun the stupid thing, which exposed its glowing engine core. He went in for the kill, joined by a pair of random players who’d been passing by.For what felt like the tenth time that afternoon, Will offered silent thanks for the fact that Destiny 2 had launched just a couple days after he’d decided to detonate his social life. For all Michael’s faults, he had still been Will’s closest friend. Everyone Will knew in Hartford, he knew through Michael. Their dog had been Michael’s dog before it had been their dog. Will was left with his sister, a couple of acquaintances he’d made through work, and that was it. Well, and Destiny. He also had Destiny.The tank exploded, and Will got some loot for his trouble. Blue gun, blue helmet…. garbage. It didn’t matter; on to the next mission. His Destiny to-do list relaxed him. He hadn’t been a huge fan of the first game, but he could tell this one was an obvious improvement, particularly in the “stuff to do” department. He could just screw around in one of the planetary patrol zones for an hour or two without getting bored, and he got the sense there were still a lot of things he hadn’t found because he didn’t read guides or forums online. He’d liked the story, too, though he had a hard time keeping track of all the characters. It didn’t really matter, he guessed. It was obvious who the good guys were, and who the bad guy was. Plus it had the guy from Firefly in it.Will knew Destiny was meant to be played with other people, but he’d come to the first game late and never really established a regular crew to play with. So far he’d been playing the sequel solo, too, casually messing around in the patrol zones and doing strikes with randoms. He was supposed to be trawling Craigslist for apartment listings, but most days after work he’d smoke some weed, put on his headphones, and spend the night enveloped in technicolor explosions and melodramatic choral chants. He knew plenty of people liked to get lit and play Destiny with their friends—some types of cough were impossible to disguise over voice chat—but he never felt comfortable playing stoned with strangers. Their faceless voices were too remote, and he’d get paranoid. Better to go it alone.Will liked Destiny 2’s sights and sounds, but he liked the sense of progression even more. Humans were simple animals, he figured. They liked watching progress-bars fill up and numbers climb. Destiny 2 had some really good bars and numbers, better even than the first game. He figured he’d be filling bars and raising numbers in this game for at least another month or two. He’d seen some stuff online about how to max out his power level, but as far as he could tell that required getting into gear mods and doing a lot of complicated inventory management. Too much of a pain. He didn’t care if the numbers were climbing at their fastest possible rate; it was enough that they kept going up. He checked his current power level. 273. Not bad.Shit, he’d missed what what his sister had just said, and now she was waiting for him to respond. He tried to replay her last few sentences. She’d been talking about one of the other parents at his nephew’s school, right? He took a shot in the dark. “Yeah, that sounds… uh. That’s tricky.” Fuck. She’d noticed his hesitation. “No, I’m listening. I am! You were talking about Cal’s school, and that one mom who keeps being weird about Cal and her son.” There it was; he’d remembered. Will grimaced and looked back at the screen, desperately trying to get his character to a ledge where he wouldn’t get shot. Destiny didn’t have a pause button, and almost anywhere you stood, something would eventually start shooting you. His controller kept buzzing, a plaintive sound in an otherwise silent apartment. This game was not great for multitaskers.After promising he’d keep the family posted on his apartment hunt, Will said goodbye and set down his phone. He turned  up the TV volume and focused his full attention back on the game, finally shooting the screeching aliens who’d been distracting him. Pop. Pop. God, headshots in this game were satisfying.There was still a lot of Destiny 2 that he hadn’t seen—the Nightfall strike, some competitive PvP stuff, the raid—but most of those things required friends. This game seemed to constantly be asking him why he didn’t have anyone to play with. Like he needed another reminder that his social life was fucked. You were supposed to be in a clan, but how did you find a clan? Will had never been in a clan in his life. There was something called “Guided Games” that he figured he could use to find other people to play with, but he hadn’t mustered up the courage to test it. Random matchmade strikes were as far as he was willing to go. 20 or 30 minutes with a couple strangers, and a big boss fight at the end. Minimal commitment, maximum enjoyment. No one talks, no one sends friend requests, and everyone goes their separate ways when it’s over.Will checked his phone and saw he’d gotten a new Facebook message. It was from Sean, an old friend from high school. Weird. What was old Sean up to? He went to unlock his phone, but his controller started vibrating again. Those aliens were back. They always came back, didn’t they?From: PeterTo: Alex, Javi, Andrew, Sean, WillSubject: <no subject>Welp. Thanks for staying up late everyone, even if we didn’t get it done. Sorry I was being a grump toward the end there. I thought we did pretty well, considering. We just need to tighten up our strategy for that last boss. And obviously, we gotta stop dying. Sucks that there’s so much randomness in that fight, felt like we were losing for some bullshit reasons. Alex, maybe if you and I switched places, and you went to the shadow realm? Or maybe not. As long as we all make our callouts, the team in the main room should be able to take care of the Councilors. I was looking on reddit and there literally aren’t any other tips for that fight, no one knows how to make it any easier. I dunno. Open to suggestions.From: JaviTo: Peter, Alex, Andrew, Sean, WillSubject: Re: <no subject>I thought we agreed we weren’t going to look anything up? I hate it when one person looks stuff up then pretends they don’t know the answers while everyone else figures out what to do.From: PeterTo: Javi, Alex, Andrew, Sean, WillSubject: Re: <no subject>Oh, I mean, I figured we spent like four hours stuck on the boss last night, so it’d be cool if I tried looking up some specific strategies. We already figured out what to do, we just have to do it without screwing up. I didn’t look ahead, promise.From: AlexTo: Peter, Javi, Andrew, Sean, WillSubject: Re: <no subject>Yeah, I looked around a bit too. Not gonna lie, that was pretty rough. I had fun with some of the earlier stuff, though the pleasure gardens can fuck off. Why does Bungie keep putting stealth sections into Destiny? Don’t they realize that it never works?I was watching Wake and some guys stream the boss last night after we called it quits, and they were doing almost exactly what we were doing. They’re all above 300 and I don’t even think their damage was that much higher. They were playing on alt characters, I think, since I’m pretty sure they all beat the raid on the first day. I watched for like an hour and they couldn’t get it done. So, hey, we’re just like them!From: SeanTo: Alex, Peter, Javi, Andrew, WillSubject: Re: <no subject>Well as the resident rookie, I had fun. I get what everyone was saying about the dogs, but I really liked the baths and the race section, that was hilarious. I wasn’t expecting raids to be so involved, since the rest of the game is so much simpler! I know I kept saying all that last night. It’s crazy, though. Do any other console games do this kind of thing? Can we go play those games, too?From: PeterTo: Sean, Javi, Andrew, Alex, WillSubject: Re: <no subject>Hahahaha Sean man I’m glad we had you come with. It’s cool to be reminded how weird Destiny raids are, since most of us have been at it so long we’ve kinda lost perspective. Plus by that seventh straight hour, you lose the will to live. I sort of wish we could take you back through the raids from the first game, especially King’s Fall and Vault of Glass. This raid was okay, but those probably had less bullshit per encounter. Maybe rose-tinted glasses on my part, haha.From: AlexTo: Peter, Javi, Andrew, Sean, WillSubject: Re: <no subject>I do like how in D2 you don’t have to level up with raid gear to be high enough level to raid. That was always so stupid. A lot of the stuff they’ve fixed in the sequel is stuff they never should’ve gotten wrong in the first place, but I guess that doesn’t mean I’m not glad they fixed it? Anyway. Everyone on to try that fight again tomorrow? I can’t do six, can you guys do 9pm?From: JaviTo: Alex, Peter, Andrew, Sean, WillSubject: Re: <no subject>9 works for me! Andrew says it’s good for him too.From: SeanTo: Javi, Alex, Andrew, Peter, WillSubject: Re: <no subject>9 is good for meFrom: WillTo: Javi, Alex, Andrew, Peter, SeanSubject: Re: <no subject>Sorry, wasn’t on email, just catching up. Ya, I can do 9.Earlier that year, Activision had flown Wake out to Los Angeles for Destiny 2’s big unveiling event. They put him up in a hotel and set him up on the main stage with a few other big streamers. Half a million people had been watching online. At the event, strangers came up like he was their friend, told him how much his streams meant to them. Reporters introduced themselves and asked him what he thought about this change, or that one. Did he care that the console version didn’t run at 60 frames per second? What did he think of the new weapon loadouts? And of course, was he considering switching to PC when that version came out? Even three years later, part of him couldn’t believe anyone cared what he thought about any of it.While he was careful never to show it on stream, Wake spent a lot of his downtime bouncing between elation and anxiety. He never forgot how lucky he was to live this life where he got paid to play video games all day. How lucky he was that Destiny had blown up, and that he’d decided to make videos about it when he did. How lucky he was that so many people seemed to admire him, that he got to be what his cousin jokingly labeled “tiny famous.”He’d managed to spin a few sponsorships and promotional appearances into a stable income, and he was even starting to put some money in the bank. It still felt tenuous. Why did people like him, in particular? What if they stopped? What if he said the wrong thing on stream, or got caught up in a scandal? Or what if the buzz on the sequel didn’t last, and some other game came along and stole Destiny’s thunder? Could he maintain his following if he switched over to another game? Easy come, easy go, and Lucas without a backup plan.All the more important to hit the sequel as hard as he could. Right now, Destiny 2 was huge on Twitch, and he was picking up more new subscribers than ever. He looked down at chat. One commenter was sounding off about how he hated the changes to Destiny 2 PvP because it made it so much less fun to play solo. “That’s true, true,” said Wake, congenially. “It’s a lot less fun solo. You get with some randoms and they don’t know what they’re doing, and suddenly your team is getting worked and there’s nothing you can do about it. Even worse is how the game matches a team of randoms with a team of dudes in a clan, who are all coordinating in chat together. Bungie’s gotta fix that.”The truth was, Wake wasn’t having as much fun with Destiny as he used to. He wasn’t sure what it was; maybe just that he’d grown as a gamer, or his tastes had changed. He’d spent some time playing Overwatch back when it came out a year ago, and had dabbled in streaming some Battlegrounds over the summer while Destiny was at a low ebb. PUBG was so much fun, and so interesting compared with Destiny. Maybe it was just over-familiarity. The better he got at Destiny, the more aware he was of its flaws.“I don’t wanna climb up Bungie’s ass or anything,” he said, leaning back in his chair and looking away from the camera. “There’s lots of stuff I still don’t like. For hardcore players like me, the endgame is already feeling thin. I feel like I’ve already gotten everything there is to get. Servers are still weird for PvP, like, how often you trade with someone? Where you both die at the same time? With all the PvP stuff, it is what it is. You all know what I’ve been saying. You can’t always look at Destiny like it’s a true competitive game. It’s not Counter-Strike.”Chat appeared to agree with him: Destiny 2 was not Counter-Strike. That was part of the problem, really. Chat always agreed with him. Most people he talked to—clanmates, commenters, subscribers—tended to agree with him, even though he knew he couldn’t be right all the time. Maybe he just needed to spend more time with other streamers, people who had their own fans and their own opinions. Maybe he should go and find a new game with a new community. Maybe he should just go back to school.Not now, though. Now, there was a new Destiny game out. There was a new raid to explore, and new secrets to dig up. He had a new crop of excited viewers, and his numbers kept going up. Trials had launched this morning, and he’d scheduled a full weekend of carrying lucky subscribers to the top of the Spire. He could think about life stuff later.“That was… fuck,” said Sean, yet again. Alex could hear a dry crack in his voice. Understandable, given that they’d been hammering away at a raid boss for seven hours straight. “I can’t believe we finally did it.”“We did it,” she responded. “We did do it. It got did. I’m still not sure how I feel about that.”“I don’t smoke, but I need a cigarette.”“I can’t get over how much bullshit was in that fight,” said Will. “I can’t believe we didn’t fuck it on that last rotation. You guys weren’t in the shadow realm, you don’t really know how bad it got. It was a miracle.”“There was a point when I didn’t know what we were gonna do,” said Sean. “We’d sunk in so much time that it felt ridiculous to quit, but winning seemed impossible. Plus, Will, you’re on east coast time, right? You are a champion.”Peter and his two friends had departed shortly after their victory, but Alex, Sean, and Will were still hanging around in chat, decompressing. Alex looked at the clock. 2:30AM, and she had work tomorrow. Maybe she’d just call in sick. She pushed the thought aside. “You guys, we did it! We fucking did it. It’s still sinking in.”“I’m starting to think we did it,” joked Sean. “Alex, did we do it?”“Shut up,” she laughed. “I gotta pee. I’ll be right back.”Alex muted her mic but kept her headset on as she walked down the hall to the bathroom. The wireless range got a bit dicy in here, but she could still hear the party chat. Her apartment got so quiet at night. Not for the first time, she wondered what her roommates made of the boisterous curses and exclamations that had been emanating from her room. Her headphones cut out, and as the signal faded back in, Will was talking.“…the most human interaction I’ve had in weeks,” he was saying. “Ever since the stuff with my ex, I haven’t actually talked to many people? Just my sister, mostly. I didn’t think I liked playing games with other people. I liked those guys we were with, though, and Alex seems cool.”“Yeah, she’s great,” said Sean. Alex smiled. She wondered if he knew she was listening in. “I’m glad she talked me into this. The game’s driven me nuts for the past week, but I can’t say it hasn’t been fun.”“Yeah, man,” said Will. “I dunno when I’ll be have time to raid like that again, but we should definitely play again soon. We should start a clan! I guess this is how you get into a clan.”Alex double-checked that her mic was muted before she flushed, then started back up the hall. As she walked, she went over her remaining Destiny to-do list. An exotic quest had opened up after they finished the raid; it rewarded you with a weird looking shotgun. She’d seen Wake streaming with it the other day, and it looked beastly. Then there was the Crucible quest—she was no great shakes at PvP, but now that she had more friends to team up with, maybe it’d be more fun? And when would they raid again? Questions for another day.She sat down and unmuted her mic. “Okay, I’m back. What were we talking about?”As I struggle to fall asleep after a night of Destiny 2, the game keeps running through my mind. It’s like getting a song stuck in my head: I see the flash of combat and feel the rumbling controller in my hands. But I rarely hear the sounds of battle. Instead, I hear voices.For all the words I’ve written about Destiny, I’ve listened to many more. Destiny is the game that I play with people, and my impressions of it and this new sequel have been irrevocably shaped by the hundreds of conversations I’ve had in and around the game itself. In between hurried strategy sessions and snippy cross-talk, we share what we like and don’t like, what Bungie has fixed and what they still need to fix, and where we see the game going from here. Sometimes we talk about our lives outside the game. Usually we don’t.""Nothing like a clean slate.""First-person loot shooterSame great shooting with a much more player-friendly design. Fantastic music. Killer story finale.Inventory management's a chore. Power leveling becomes a grind. Needs some new enemy types.BungiePS4 (reviewed), Xbox One, PCSeptember 5 (PC coming 10/24)Completed the story, a bunch of crucible matches and sidequests, and the Leviathan raid over the course of about 60 hours.What do I make of Destiny 2? The characters in the stories above aren’t real, but each one represents a part of how I actually feel. I share Peter’s appreciation of the many ways Bungie has made it more approachable than its predecessor, and his frustration at how the game still occasionally manages to get in its own way. I’m with Will on how therapeutic it can be; for all its surface-level violence, Destiny 2 is an oddly soothing game. Wake makes some good points about the changes to PvP, and I share his  sense that Destiny 2 might not hold my attention as firmly as the first game did. Alex understands how important it is to play with friends, and how lovely it can be to coax a group of strangers into accomplishing something that seemed impossible.Destiny 2 is a more competent product than its predecessor, and perhaps a less interesting game as a result. It doesn’t have the same idiosyncrasies and shortcomings, and it doesn’t seem to hold its players in such low esteem. It doesn’t dare us to break it as often.Bungie has stripped out so much of the nonsense we previously had to keep track of, and almost every simplification has been for the better. They’ve added a story that makes sense, even if by doing so they’ve robbed their robe-clad sci-fi world of some of its mystery. The raid is fascinating, thematically ambitious, and occasionally infuriating. The shooting is still fantastic; inventory management is still a pain in the ass. The armor isn’t as pretty as it was in the first game.Like many modern video games, Destiny 2 will spend the next few years in a constant state of becoming. Capturing its essence in this moment or that moment is as difficult as snatching a mosquito out of the air with two fingers. This is clearly a high point, the highest since The Taken King launched nearly two years ago. It’s a red-carpet welcome for new players and a slightly bittersweet payoff for those of us who’ve been there from the start. Soon enough, everything will change yet again.It’s been two weeks since Destiny 2 came out, and I could no more crystalize my impressions of it than I could transcribe the dozens of late night confessions, emailed strategy sessions, passive-aggressive recriminations, and heroic exultations I’ve shared with my in-game compatriots. That’s fine. Let’s live in the moment. A new era of Destiny has begun, and there’s already so much to talk about."

To cut to the chase, this is a game that finally makes good--sometimes a little too good--on Bungie's big idea of blending its genre-leading console first-person shooting with a Diablo-style loot dispenser, and it's been a long time coming. Remember 2014, when the first Destiny's notoriously fractured storyline and aimless, unfulfilling endgame grind left a large portion of its player base feeling shortchanged? Bungie does. On both counts, it's clear in playing Destiny 2 that Bungie learned most of the right lessons from the turmoil of Destiny's debut, even as it feels like the studio also forgot some of what made Destiny unique along the way.Destiny 2 certainly has a more coherent story than last time. The sequel turns the forgettable faction vendors from the first Destiny into living, breathing video game characters and casts them in a desperate fight for survival as a legion of particularly mean Cabal, the franchise's monstrous spacefaring version of the Roman Empire, shows up and kicks what's left of humanity out of its last refuge on Earth. These principal characters are scattered across the solar system as the Cabal busies itself stealing the god-like powers of the enigmatic giant space orb that makes Destiny possible, and you then spend a dozen-odd missions flying from moon to planetoid to capital spaceship and back, trying to recruit those faction vendors back into the fold so they can lead an assault on the Cabal occupation. In contrast to the nebulous mess of the original, Destiny 2's story is clearly presented and you never have to stop and scratch your head, wondering what you're doing and why. There are unique mission mechanics, fast-paced vehicle sequences, and a whole lot of enormity and spectacle that recall Bungie's best campaigns. It's epic and exciting and focused in a way the original Destiny wasn't.At the same time, there's a distinct shift in tone from the first game. Where Destiny was austere to a fault, the sequel overcorrects with a cast that sometimes feels like it's made up entirely of comic relief (and not all of the jokes are very comical), and the plot turns on more trite video game clichés than I've come to expect from Bungie. The story revolves around a world-destroying super machine and a sneering one-note villain in a way that's a little too predictable, coming from a studio that's never really relied on things like mustache-twirling bad guys. Recall that the entire Halo series' long-running antagonist wasn't a single villain but a multi-species alien religious cult with a complex hierarchy and system of beliefs. The first Destiny struggled to even effectively explain who you were fighting against or what the stakes were, but I hoped for a little more than a vaguely generic bad guy who wants to blow everything up in the sequel.For all the incoherence of its plot, Destiny managed to imply the outlines of a vastly grander world than what was taking place right in front of you. It was a world with numerous alien factions each with their own agendas, rituals, and social structures--even if you had to dig through digital trading cards on your phone to fully understand everything--all taking place against the crumbling interplanetary remains of humanity's most triumphant era. A couple of those alien factions feel like they're reduced to set dressing in Destiny 2, and with a few exceptions there's less interest in building intrigue around the mysteries of a fallen civilization. The first game struck a unique blend of tangible and mystical. Its combination of post-utopian science fiction and classical mythology created a specific atmosphere that fired the imagination, and its setting among our solar system's most familiar and yet unknowable locations served a function of wish fulfillment, as you rooted around the remains of a research collective on Venus or explored alien cathedrals hollowed out of the goddamn Moon. Destiny 2 makes a similar attempt, but comes up short. Of the game's four locations, one is essentially a glorified oil rig, and while another, Nessus, is technically a real planetoid way out in the far reaches, who had ever heard of it before this game? To some extent this is all a matter of taste; Destiny 2 trades breadth for focus, and that'll work better for some people, but it resulted in a less memorable experience for me. Bungie's storytelling has always been a little weird, but not much of Destiny 2 is as weird as the first game.Having said all this, the conclusion of Destiny 2's campaign defied my expectations in some startling ways, and there's such an urgency to the last handful of missions and the world of Destiny is left so fundamentally revitalized after the last couple of hours that the ending did a little to relieve my relative disappointment with some of what had preceded it. Without getting too specific, the campaign leaves the world of Destiny in an exciting place, and sets up the franchise to deliver new stories in the future that are more in line with what I've come to expect from this series.There's a good chance you'll actually want to stick around this time for those new stories to drop over the coming months and years. The single best thing I can say about Destiny 2 is that Bungie has finally found a way to fit all of the game's nuts and bolts together to create a loot shooter satisfying enough that the only reason to stop playing it is because you've run out of things to do. And there's a lot to do. In addition to the campaign, all the activities you expect from the first game return, from patrols and public events in the open world to three-player strikes, the competitive Crucible, and weekly rotations of ultra-hard Nightfall strikes and Trials of the Nine competitive matches. And then, of course, there's a post-game raid for six players, a grueling cooperative challenge that can take you a dozen hours to analyze, figure out, and actually defeat.Sure, most of this stuff was featured in the first Destiny, but it's all been refreshed or improved here in significant ways. There are more types of public events now, and they all have optional heroic versions that are harder and yield more rewards (and are a challenge to unlock in their own right). Nightfalls now come with more inventive modifiers that dramatically change the way you play. The first game's Nightfalls merely increased various weapons' damage and forced you to restart the entire mission if your team wiped, leading you to play incredibly cautiously (or in my case, frequently not play at all). The new Nightfalls feature tight timers and rotating damage mechanics that require precise, coordinated, speedy play that's an exhilarating improvement on the plodding old version. The Crucible comes with a smattering of standard modes across multiple playlists, and while this sort of multiplayer with its player shields, high-flying jump jets, and all-powerful super abilities isn't for everyone, I've come to enjoy the smaller scale and more tactical nature of Destiny 2's multiplayer now that it's been reduced to four players. If nothing else, this makes it a lot easier to get a fireteam of three other people together to play with you, and a good fireteam with strong communication can really clean up in there.The key to making Destiny 2's activities and character progression so much more seamless and rewarding than in the first game is in simplification. Bungie has thrown out all the esoteric nonsense from the first game, with its half-dozen different types of upgrade currencies and weird quest items and other concepts that some players understandably balked at. In place of all that, there's now a simple reputation system where each planet and each type of activity has a vendor associated with it, and anything you do on that planet or in that activity contributes to your reputation with that vendor. When the meter with a given vendor ticks over, you pick up another item package. Rinse and repeat as necessary. Whether you're running a ton of strikes, or playing Crucible endlessly, or hanging out with friends and casually popping off public events and looking for treasure chests in the European Dead Zone, you're earning rep that will translate into new gear sooner than later. And all of these activities are tied together with a challenge system that gives you even more goals to work for and results in even more gear on a daily basis, with a weekly set of ""milestone"" quests that guarantee you gear well above your level if you complete the requisite activities. The game has a way of making you feel like you're working toward three or four different goals at once. Where Destiny sometimes felt too stingy with its gear drops, especially in the endgame, you'll quickly have more loot in this game than you know what to do with.Actually, that's the other thing that makes Destiny 2 work better: they upped the drop rates. A lot. You will not stop getting a steady stream of better gear right up till you're ready to tackle the endgame raid, and there are relatively easy ways to level beyond that. The elusive exotics--hand-crafted weapons and armor that were so rare in the first game Bungie added another item to increase your chances of seeing them--are now built-in quest rewards throughout the story and also drop at a startlingly fast pace. For the most part all this loot keeps the game humming along, and keeps the endorphines pumping steadily in your brain as you get new guns and armor at a steady clip. I can't believe I'm saying this, but at times it can instead feel like too much of a good thing, and I almost wished the game would pump the brakes a little. Some of the lower-level guns are quite fun to use, but during the early game you rarely use the same gun for more than an hour before you get something better and feel compelled to switch to the thing with the higher number. It doesn't always feel like a given loadout has time to breathe before you're shaking it up again.The bigger problem with getting so much loot is that you can level right past some of the better content in Destiny 2 without realizing it. Bungie has included a new ""adventure"" category of missions scattered around each location, and these are well worth seeing. While the main campaign typically makes you feel like you just arrived at a new location before you're being whisked off to the next one, the adventure missions help to flesh out and develop the characters and goings-on in a specific place. Each one has unique voiceovers and little self-contained storylines, and many of them feature unique mechanics or take you to some really impressive-looking parts of each zone that you wouldn't necessarily run across otherwise. The problem is, the rewards for these missions are fixed and aren't especially valuable in light of all the other activities that yield gear much faster, so if you're doing a mix of Crucible, public events, and so forth along with the campaign, you can reach a point before you realize it where the adventures are no longer valuable from an upgrade perspective. It would have been nice to see these missions utilized in a way that feels more meaningful to your character progression, and I ended up solving this problem by, uh, starting a second character and making sure to step off the loot treadmill to stop and smell the roses once in a while. Though, if the arc of the first Destiny is any indication, there's a good chance Bungie will go in and find a way to draw more players into this sort of meaningful side content over time.Destiny 2 adds a tremendous number of quality-of-life improvements that should be a huge relief for long-suffering fans of the first game. You can now travel directly from planet to planet, rather than having to sit through one loading screen to return to orbit, then another one to fly to a new location. Unidentified loot engrams now go into their own inventory bucket rather than cluttering up your gear slots, and in a why-didn't-they-think-of-this-before move, the game now takes all the gear you possess in your inventory and vault into account when it generates new loot for you, rather than forcing you to tediously equip your highest-value stuff every time you go to decode an engram. Public events now show up on zone maps complete with a little timer telling you exactly when they'll start. And clans, which were worse than useless in the first game, are now a brilliant way not just to organize activities with friendly players, but to collectively contribute to group goals. Clans level up based on everything their members do in the game, unlocking little buffs and bonuses along the way. And in perhaps the most player-friendly change in all of Destiny 2, every week that a single clan fireteam completes a tough challenge like a Nightfall, raid, or Trials run, every clan member gets a piece of high-value, rare loot. The new clan system is a brilliant way to get people together for pickup activities and so forth. It's entirely possible I've had more social interaction in two weeks of playing Destiny 2 than I've had in calendar 2017 to date, which I hope says more about what a good time this game is with friends than it does about me.Perhaps the one mark on Destiny 2's record is its increased focus on microtransactions. The first game introduced paid cosmetic items and player emotes over time in a relatively inoffensive way, and that system returns here in an expanded capacity. There are way more and higher quality cosmetics than before, and you can actually earn a fair number of them for free just by playing the game (paying will only give you quite a few more of them faster). The one outrageous exception is the change to the shader system that previously let you dye all your gear the same color. On the upside, shaders can now be applied individually to each piece of armor, and also to every gun, sparrow, and ship in the game. On the downside, shaders are now single-use items that you'll need to grind to obtain more of... unless you pay real money to get them faster, and even then you may not get the ones you want. And this is in a game where you change gear constantly and will lose those shaders sooner than you'd like. It's a real shame to see Bungie regress a previously player-friendly customization system, seemingly in an effort to drive microtransactions.It goes without saying that Destiny's core shooting remains among the absolute best available on a console, but it's worth noting that the game's three classes and their three subclasses have been redesigned from the ground up to give you more interesting and consistent gameplay options. In contrast to Destiny's confusing grid of ability bubbles, the subclass skill trees here are easily legible and are all split into two branches, each of which has a unifying theme. So if you want a gameplay style that revolves around getting aerial kills, or one that lets you recover health in multiple ways, or one that just lets you punch the hell out of everything, you can have that. The perks on a lot of exotic gear seem tailored to further enhance specific subclasses, and there's also a fairly clever (if slightly confusing) new gear mod system that lets you add even more buffs to weapon handling, ability recharge rates, and so forth on each piece of gear. You can even use gear mods to change out the damage type on elemental weapons. Speaking of weapons, the first game's primary/secondary/heavy system has given way to kinetic, energy, and power types. Now hand cannons and auto, scout, and pulse rifles can have elemental damage types and sit in both your first and second slots, letting you customize more thoroughly with weapon combinations you couldn't use before. Shotguns and sniper rifles now hang out in the power category along with rocket launchers and swords, which certainly makes them a less frequent annoyance in the Crucible, and the game seems to be more generous with power ammo in PVE activities, so you still get to use those weapons plenty there. Just about everything related to the combat in Destiny 2 feels more varied and thoughtful than it did in the first game.It shouldn't be surprising to say the look and feel of Destiny 2 more than lives up to Bungie's considerable pedigree, but that doesn't diminish the sheer artistic accomplishment of the game. Even as I found some of the new planetary locations conceptually less interesting than those of the first Destiny, I also lost count of the times my jaw dropped open at some perfectly framed scene or elaborately lit tableau, especially in the raid and some of the strikes. There's an increase in both the size and detail of the game's environments over the first Destiny, probably owing to the focus on current console hardware this time around, and the second-to-last mission of the campaign in particular features some of the most breathtaking and larger-than-life imagery I can ever remember in a game. And while I sorely miss Marty O'Donnell's signature percussion and the game could use a few more french horns, the Destiny 2 score has grown on me considerably over a few dozen hours. There are some really memorable themes in here, and the inclusion of the Kronos Quartet gives a couple of dramatic scenes some real emotional oomph.Like with any loot game, you'll eventually exhaust Destiny 2's content, but unlike the first Destiny, you'll likely feel a lot more satisfied when you do. The new raid, Leviathan, is much easier for new players to access in terms of gear requirements, and has an unexpected setting and some utterly wild visuals and moments, even though a couple of the encounters are infuriatingly inconsistent at the moment. Trials of the Nine has less stringent requirements than its incarnation in the first game as well, and if you play enough of it you might earn enough rep for an item or two even if you never manage to eke out seven consecutive wins. Bungie has also gotten better about communicating its roadmap for future content and is already teasing something called ""Faction Rally"" in the near future, and you can bet Iron Banner will worm its way back into the game some weekend soon. And this is all in advance of the first DLC pack coming in three months, which is rumored to contain an entire new planet to explore, provided you like this game enough to pay for more of it. That's the biggest success of this sequel: it's now good enough that you no longer need to make excuses about why you play so much Destiny. Destiny 2 may misstep in a couple of ways its predecessor didn't, but it also shores up its fundamentals so thoroughly that the future for Destiny fans looks bright indeed.The CHAMP and Jan are here to deliver news on The Last of Us Part 1 PC port, EA layoffs, PSVR2 reports, and more!© 2023 GIANT BOMB, A FANDOM COMPANY.

Destiny 2,Mike Williams,USgamer,http://www.usgamer.net/articles/destiny-2-review,"Destiny 2 comes to PC to shake up the torpid loot shooter scene, and it's all the better for it.There’s a gratifying feeling PC players know very well. The relief of downloading a new game and seeing it run great out of the gate without much tinkering. Whether it’s the many years of bad ports, or the specific desires of players on a platform as malleable as PC, there’s always been this looming worry that the next big game will screw something up somewhere.The PC version of Destiny 2 effortlessly nullifies these worries in the first few minutes, but it’s how it plays beyond the opening moments that turns it from a good PC port into a good game. Practically every website covered Destiny 2 in September. Most people reading this probably already know that the story is nothing to write home about, and that the endgame leaves something to be desired for the most hardcore fans.The number of environments, weapons, activities, rewards and everything else around what you actually get up to in Destiny 2 is well documented in our Destiny 2 guide and hundreds of other places online.The praise and grievances are all relevant here, no less valid than they were at the console launch. Nothing on that end has changed; this is still the same game many played in September. So instead of wasting time rehashing old critique, I am keen to tell you about my experience as a PC player in a game ostensibly designed as a console shooter first. 
 
The first thing that immediately hit me was the much higher frame-rate. Before I had time to properly judge weapon mechanics or how character movement feels on a keyboard, I was in awe of how smooth the game runs during quiet and hectic moments alike. I had no problems maxing out all settings at 1440p and averaging 120fps. Admittedly, it's a near-top-of-the-line PC, but you won't need much if you aim for 60fps.There is no question about the responsiveness upgrade you feel at higher frame-rates. Destiny 2 already felt great at 30fps, I would even argue it feels better than some 60fps shooters on consoles.But on PC, with frame-rates as high as your machine can pump out, the game is unshackled. Your inputs feel all the more tactile. Unloading the entire clip of a hand cannon, then throwing a grenade and dodging into a reload as a Hunter feels like some ideal version of Overwatch’s McCree we never got. The precision of a mouse offers infinite utility, and much greater control. More than that, it opens up new avenues for you to appreciate and enjoy weapon classes Destiny players have been using in a certain way for years.A slow-firing auto rifle was something I often avoided on console. If I needed a low rate-of-fire precision weapon, I’d use a scout rifle. On PC, I could easily turn this auto rifle into a scout rifle by tap-firing without losing any of the precision. Sure, a scout rifle will always have higher impact, but I had more control over something so small than I ever did on a controller.I worried hand cannons would be cumbersome and unnecessarily slow after playing the beta, but the sheer number of them in the full game negated this almost immediately. In fact, it made me appreciate some of the finer variances between the slow, classic revolver-style hand cannons and the more modern options. But gunplay isn’t the only thing that feels great on PC. Character movement is similarly well adapted to keyboard’s digital inputs. 
 
Your average Destiny session features a lot of platforming, and while the original game changed my mind on the point of having this at all in a first-person game, Destiny 2 convinced me that first-person platforming can still feel good without analogue inputs. This is a big deal; PC shooters for years have been struggling with the best way to implement first-person platforming. The old Half-Life nightmare level comes to mind.The games that figured this out – like Portal – had much less of an emphasis on combat. While Destiny 2 doesn't ask a lot of you in most firefights, pulling off cool moves is what keeps combat interesting. Platforming and air movement are big parts of that, and they must respect your momentum without feeling floaty and weightless – see Borderlands for the worst way to do this.None of these issues are anywhere to be found here. I deliberately picked a Warlock in the launch version because I remember hating its jump and air control on a pad. I still think it’s the worst of the three classes in this regard, but I have never quite appreciated the reason for why Warlock jumps have so much glide until I played on PC. Perhaps through sheer luck or genius forward-thinking, the UI in Destiny was designed to work well with a mouse from the start. On console, you control what’s essentially a big mouse cursor. This translates well to PC, for the most part.Navigating a planet’s map doesn’t respond too well to the speed of a mouse. The camera pans at a speed typical of analogue sticks, and you can't use arrow or WASD keys to navigate it like some RTS games. It’s not a big issue, but together with the unnecessary push towards holding buttons instead of pressing them, makes certain parts of the UI, such as checking the weekly Milestones, feel finicky.You’ll quickly forget Destiny 2’s roots as a console shooter once you get used to these quirks. The game plays just as well as any PC open-world shooter. Getting around the world is easy. Jumping off a Sparrow into a Public Event before getting lost trying to locate the chest you’re hearing the chime for feels natural on mouse and keyboard. The incredibly fast load times (even on a regular HDD) means that even the in-orbit moments are cut to 20 or 30 seconds, and I never once hit the in-world loading issues I got so many times on consoles.  
 
Bungie always struck me as a developer too precious about the games it makes and the worlds within them. The old joke of capitalising every other word in dialogue still holds true. For all my time watching, playing, and covering Destiny, the studio’s vision for everything within it - from the way the action feels, how rewards are doled out, and down to how stories are told - is one that’s always been very specific. It was a surprise to see a studio that’s so wrapped up in how its creations are perceived recognise that the needs and expectations of a whole new platform could mean that some of these beliefs will have to be abandoned. Let me be frank. The PC port of a game as a popular as Destiny would have probably sold just fine even if it was terrible. Taken a step further, a competent but otherwise lacking port accompanied by hollow claims about how the game should ""feel"" from Bungie would have still done well commercially. Destiny 2 on PC could have easily been just another console port that looks and runs a bit nicer than consoles, but doesn’t really do any one thing well enough to truly feel at home on PC.So to see how far Bungie and Vicarious Visions have gone to make this a good PC shooter first, and a good port as well, tells me that nothing was off the table during development. And beyond that, it signifies a commitment to PC from the most unlikely places. 
 
Destiny 2 on PC is a completely different experience to the one on consoles, not just because of its technical implementation, but in how it feels when you do the things we’ve been doing on consoles for years. Destiny 2 players on PS4 and Xbox One who are serious enough about the game need to consider migrating to PC. Technical analysis revealed that you can easily achieve 1080p/60fps on plenty of affordable hardware configurations.The game still plays great on a controller on PC, and no amount of exclusive content will matter when you see it running this well. Sure, you’ll have to stomach the upfront cost of a PC, but I am willing to bet you’ll find other uses for the new machine than just playing Destiny 2.Before the release of Destiny 2, PC players looking for a loot shooter had one of two options. Replay any of the Borderlands games, and suffer through plenty of samey drops and mediocre shooting mechanics. Or download Warframe, a free-to-play Diablo-esque shooter that feels good to play but has a grindy progression system and uninteresting environments.Players on PC no longer have to contend with less when the best one is right there on their preferred platform.You're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!

Destiny 2,Patrick Hancock,Destructoid,https://www.destructoid.com/review-destiny-2-pc--473355.phtml,"darkThe Destiny franchise has finally come to PC. I’ve always been interested in the franchise, but I never play my Xbox in any meaningful capacity so I knew if I were to ever get my hands on the series, it would have to be on PC. It makes sense — both the loot-driven and FPS genres thrive on PC, so an amalgamation of the two feels right at home.I had some concerns about jumping into the second game without any knowledge of the first, but it’s worked in the past so I figured it could work again here. While there are some high notes, I feel as if Destiny 2 mostly misses its mark.Destiny 2 (PC)Developer: BungiePublisher: ActivisionMSRP: $59.99Release Date: October 24, 2017I’m honestly not completely sure what happens in Destiny 2’s story. Like, I get the gist of it and I always know what my character is supposed to be doing, but coming with no prior knowledge of the previous game left me with nothing but apathy for just about everything. There’s a moment in the story where a character, as dramatically as possible, says “Get me so-and-so and whatshername” and then the cutscene ends. All I was left thinking was “I bet that was dramatic and cool for people who know those characters.”That being said, even without any real knowledge of Destiny and its world, damn, does Destiny 2 know how to build to some incredible moments. I don’t need to know anyone’s motives to understand that playing around with unlimited light is an exhilarating moment. While most of the boss fights are more spongy than epic, there are smaller moments in the story that sticks out the most. Just as impressive are the tonal shifts, which Destiny 2 performs excellently. I felt some genuine dread while moving through the darker areas with my flashlight on.It’s a bit sad to have gone through almost all of the content entirely alone, given the multiplayer-leaning design of the game itself. It’s so strange to see so many people running around the hub world and out on the various planets and have no way to talk to them. Why do I need to use third-party websites to create an actual team? Why is there no general chat? I get mixed messages when I play in Destiny 2. It is structured like an MMORPG, but with none of the things that make the genre memorable.As a first-person shooter, it feels great. The different types of guns all have a distinct flavor, as do the unique weapons later on. But again, I feel like there are mixed messages being sent between the design and the gameplay. I’m led to believe that there is more than just shooting here: a supercharged ability, class-specific abilities, and an entire skill tree to work through. When taking a closer look though, there’s not much to separate this from most other FPS games. A grenade and melee attack with some quirky interactions is hardly what I would call interesting.This would be less of an issue if the cooldowns were shorter. It often feels as if Destiny 2 is a traditional FPS game until the big boss fights, at which point everyone just dumps their abilities into it until it dies. Outside of those larger fights, I would occasionally use my grenade when an appropriately grouped bunch of enemies presented itself. On the flip side, I often felt discouraged from using my melee attack; it was always tied with reducing the cooldown of things that were usually already up (I played primarily as a Warlock, I understand that this is not an issue with every class).Things start to get better in Strikes, which act as an end-game series of repeatable missions for teams of three. When players are rotating their ability usage, combat is much more fluid and fast-paced. Yet again, no one communicates. I’ve typed things into the chat plenty of times and had no response from anyone. Most people seem pretty determined to blast through the content as quick as possible. I always seem to be on a team with those who cut every corner possible, which can be pretty off-putting, especially if you haven’t done the Strike before. “I guess we don’t have to kill these guys…”Then again, the game almost demands that you zoom through the end-game stuff as fast as possible. After completing the story, it felt like a slog to increase my power (light) level. Since this power is tied to the player’s armor and weapon levels, everything is loot dependent. “Leveling up” means nothing and is more of a progress indicator for the story missions. After reaching max level, gaining experience simply leads to receiving another bright engram, which is essentially a lootbox and, of course, you could also just pay for these. The game doesn’t feel too skewed towards making the player feel as if they need to pay for them, but the temptation is constantly there. As Chris mentioned in his original review, it’s not quite pay-to-win, but it’s damn close.I enjoy a loot treadmill as much as the next person, but this feels awfully structured. From what I’ve experienced, the loot players find that playing the missions is great for getting to the end-game, but after that, it‘s mostly vendor trash. Finding guns that increase the character’s light level by one feels pitiful. It’s the engrams that promise larger leaps. So players play Strikes as fast as possible to earn an engram or two, open it, and see if they become “more powerful.” Sure, it’s exciting to open up a legendary engram and find something badass, but it’s equally deflating to open up a legendary engram and find something badass that you found five hours ago. Your progression is not tied to your performance, but instead tied to chance.I am also shoe-horned into using my strongest weapons all the time. For example, I have no interest in power weapons that aren’t shotguns or swords. However, if I receive a rocket launcher that’s +30 to my current sword, there’s no reason for me to stay with the sword other than the fact that I like it more. I just need to hope that I find an equally powerful sword. It’s rare that the weapons ever feel more damaging than a previous one — the number is just higher. My 240 power level sniper rifle is the same thing as my 100, except the number that pops out of the enemy is bigger this time. There are some innate weapon mods like quick-scoping, and also player-driven mods to make weapons better, but rarely do they make a significant impact on the weapon’s feedback to the player.The PVP Crucible is another way to spend your end-game, but man, I’m not sure why players would spend their time here. Given the cooldowns, PVP is essentially any other FPS game where the players occasionally throw out a sci-fi ability. It’s an okay experience, but an all too familiar one, which is a letdown. I suppose the cooldowns help balance everything in the long run, but the end result is a par-for-the-course PVP experience.For me, it was all about the “Adventures” and Public Events. Adventures are essentially side-quests that pop up around the various planets and feel way more natural. This has been my go-to content outside of the story missions. They get reset and can be replayed, but unless you’re a super-hardcore player you likely won’t feel the need to constantly play the same Adventures over and over again — there are enough to keep things varied. Public Events are just that – events that anyone on the planet (in your instance, at least) can cooperate in and gather some loot. It can feel weird to do the same mission time and time again, but it’s not as farfetched or as boring as other repeatable missions, and again, they feel more natural. These two things are what keep me coming back to Destiny 2.The PC version runs incredibly well. I have never seen the framerate drop below 60 (cutscenes are locked at 30), and generally rests at around 70-90. The environments look absolutely stunning; there were multiple times where I simply stopped what I was doing just to look around. Likewise, the soundtrack to Destiny 2 is phenomenal. Why haven’t more people brought this up? The brilliant score hits all the right notes and makes those aforementioned incredible moments even more memorable.There are definitely some weird, probably console-driven decisions in here. It can take forever to get rid of your excess inventory by dismantling. Players need to hold the F key while mousing over the item, which slides the next item into that slot as the first item disappears. To dismantle that item, however, the mouse has to leave it and come back. Every time. Why can’t I ctrl-click a group of items and dismantle them all at once? Also, why the heck doesn’t the map screen start centered around my character?I was glad to see a colorblind mode included, but it doesn’t address my biggest color issue: the weapon element colors. Each sub-weapon comes with an element: solar, void, and arc (or, as I know them, firey, circle-stuff, and spiky-ball). Certain enemies have an appropriately colored shield (red, purple, light blue) that need to be hit with the appropriate elemental weapon for easy disposal. Problem is, I can’t tell the difference between the void and arc colors, especially not mid-firefight. I essentially just hope for the best when shooting either of those two shields.Destiny 2 is an incredibly competent shooter that lacks a strong identity. Just when I think I understand what it’s going for, some off-brand design decision comes into play that shows me I’m wrong. PC players who missed out on the first game will likely have no interest in the actual story, but the missions are varied and exciting enough to be worthwhile. Despite my issues, I can easily see myself jumping back into Destiny 2 frequently enough to shoot some aliens and scoop up some loot.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]AlrightSlightly above average or simply inoffensive. Fans of the genre should enjoy them a bit, but a fair few will be left unfulfilled.

Cody Perez 
After a lengthy, dense campaign mission, I gently laid the controller down with my heart still beating rapidly. I had just experienced challenging platforming across broken walkways, fights through dark, suffocating passages, traversing rigs anchored above unnaturally large waves, and a suspension bridge battle complete with wave after wave of enemies. All to turn on the power.This was just one of several missions that you will encounter over the course of the Destiny 2 campaign, and it didn’t hold back at all; a summary for this hotly anticipated sequel as a whole. An absolute surprise considering I had put more than 30 hours into the original, only to realize it just wasn’t for me.A long-time Halo fan, I wanted to see Bungie be successful on its own two feet, but the first game just didn’t cut it. Coupled with playing the first two of three tutorial missions at E3, I was very skeptical of Destiny 2. Everything looked and felt like more of the same, just with the addition of a number.However, it was through those opening missions that Destiny 2 took the time to prove that it means business. The story – and yes, there is an actual story – begins with the Tower social hub from Destiny being attacked by a new faction of Cabal called the Red Legion.We’ll keep this relatively spoiler-free, but these first three missions play out as a symbolic passing of the torch as you witness the subsequent destruction of what you once knew and the emotional, even painful beginning of something else entirely.Having done the first two missions once already, I was eager to rush through, but the third and final tutorial mission accomplished its feat of forcing me to slow down and pay attention. It was the first sign that Destiny 2 is something entirely different from its predecessor.This carried on through the entirety of the campaign, gripping me in a way that only Bungie’s former series Halo was able to. There were so many moments that shocked and awed me, including numerous cutscenes that brought meaning to the narrative and an actually fleshed out villain.That isn’t to say that it doesn’t have its flaws, though. Once the game opens up to its first major area where you can explore and go on side missions, there is a sort of disconnect between the main campaign and everything else there. I found out very quickly that it’s best to ignore the new Adventure missions and the like that are there purely as filler content.These side quests are monotonous and a bore to accomplish, lacking the heart that fills the campaign. At the beginning, it’s best to not try to complete everything on the map, as it does nothing except grant XP and kill the vibe. However, what does work are the public events that occur.These only happen every once in a while and last just a few moments, but there’s joy to be found in being drawn to the same centralized spot as strangers and completing a difficult task together. It also helps that the environments you’ll be visiting are stunning, from the grassy woodlands of the European Dead Zone to chained-together platforms stationed on endless water to a hidden desolate wasteland-turned-paradise.Destiny 2 is just as visual pleasing as it is to play. Bungie are masters of gun-play and it’s no different here. The much needed quality-of-life improvements like removing the trio of primary, special, and heavy weapons in favor of the less restrictive categories of kinetic, energy, and power weapons are much appreciated. This is in addition to more plentiful ammo, smarter enemy AI, and more accessible multiplayer.You gain access to the Crucible as early as level two, allowing you to jump into both quickplay and competitive matches of four versus four. Crucible is virtually unchanged, minus the addition of some new maps and a couple of new modes. It isn’t a total blunder, but it’s disappointing that it didn’t get the same love that the singleplayer had been given.Countdown is an interesting addition, giving a condensed version of Battlefield’s Rush, where two teams take turns planting bombs and defending points. It breaks up the usual cycle of modes like Control or Clash, but it also brings attention to the Crucible’s most glaring issues.The new maps are all rather small and confined. This in and of itself isn’t so bad, but it causes multiplayer to be non-stop action. This means there is no downtime for you to strategize or catch your breath. It alleviates the dreaded campers, but it also eliminates any sort of natural ebb and flow that is crucial to online multiplayer.On the opposite end of the multiplayer spectrum, cooperative modes like Strikes have improved greatly. Strikes are set to a playlist much like the Crucible where it queues you up with other players and immediately sends you on the mission. The several available Strikes at launch are vastly different in design.Though all Destiny 2 Strikes end one way or another in a huge boss battle, the journey to that point is unique. The levels vary from narrow passages to open battlefields, with more than a few surprises I won’t spoil. The boss battles themselves are multi-layered affairs, including sub-objectives that must be completed in order to win.To complete a Strike in Destiny 2, though, the playlist is locked behind a wall that requires you to be a certain level and more than halfway through the story. It isn’t the only feature that is locked behind a significant amount of playtime, as there are several like this, including rather simple ones like challenges (think bounties). This can be frustrating, as the game forces you to grind on several occasions to access new areas, features, and even the story.Thankfully, the overall character progression in Destiny 2 is generous, granting you endless amounts of loot from enemies and mission rewards. Even the ever elusive Exotic weapons and armor are granted occasionally, allowing you to adequately prepare ahead of time for the endgame content.Speaking of endgame content, we waited to post our final review in eager anticipation for the Leviathan raid. We’ve posted our full impressions for that here, but the short of it is that Destiny 2 is notable for having enough content at the end to last you for months to come.The Raid coupled with all of the level 20 quests, Adventures (which are much more fun to complete after the story instead of during), the endless Crucible, Milestones, and many, many hours of grinding towards the power cap supplies everything you need to get hundreds of hours of play out of just what the base game offers.The content doesn’t end there, as Bungie has already detailed even more content to come like Trials, the return of the Iron Banner, and the leaked first expansion called Curse of Osiris. Destiny 2 has renewed my faith in Bungie, the series as a whole, and is easily what the first Destiny should’ve been as it fulfills on everything that it originally seemed it would be and more.Cody Perez is an Editor at Game Revolution.

Destiny 2,Chris Carter,Destructoid,https://www.destructoid.com/review-destiny-2-459702.phtml,"dark[Read reviews for the Curse of Osiris, Warmind, and Forsaken expansions.]Bungie kind of promised the world when it gave us the original Destiny. The hype was astronomical, and the first preview event didn’t even have a playable build. What we actually ended up getting was a very strong shooter with a weak RPG backbone, a foundation that was slowly built up over the course of several years.Destiny 2 still isn’t the game that was described to us ages ago when the hype train began, but at this point, it’s good enough if you’re looking for an action shooter.Destiny 2 (PC, PS4 [reviewed], Xbox One)Developer: BungiePublisher: ActivisionRelease Date: September 6, 2017 (consoles), October 24, 2017 (PC)MSRP: $59.99The chief improvement in the sequel is that Bungie went out of its way to make everything less of a chore. General tweaks have been made that place an emphasis on just roaming around and having fun, and are akin to Blizzard’s lauded complete rework of Diablo III with “Loot 2.0.” While doing patrols in the past and happening upon public events that you’d find off of a third-party website felt like a tedious grind in the first game, now it’s desirable (and visible on-screen), both in terms of loot and for showing off where the game nails it the most — combat.Everything is flashier and more functional in Destiny 2. Instead of sticking with a tried and true subclass, I loved experimenting with all three for Warlock, Titan, and Hunter, trying new combos out with friends and trying to synergize class abilities. The end result is that everyone has more utility, and there’s less room for cookie-cutter builds (though they’ll still exist when the raid rolls around). It took years, but they’re pretty close to getting balance right.Even the story has more panache, which mostly works in its favor. Sure it might basically be a re-telling of several Star Wars beats, but it’s easy to follow and even easier to get invested in, with the game’s cast coming front and center. Every performance, including Lance Reddick’s Zavala and Nathan Fillion’s Cayde-6, feel less phoned in, and some of the newcomers have already cemented their place in the Destiny universe.You’re still going to get a few low points just like the first, there’s no escaping that. A few quests are almost exactly the same, the enemies are mostly the same as the original, and there’s a ton of re-used assets and re-used areas even within scenarios unique to Destiny 2 (the Nightfall for the first week is almost entirely re-purposed hub zones). But again, everything just flows so much better here, as you can level up and earn satisfying levels of loot through PVP, dungeons, or open world play. No longer do I feel obligated to stick to one planet to level, as I frequently found myself hopping between all four and joining in on public events just for the hell of it.Planets, mind, that are vastly improved both from a lore perspective and in terms of personality. There’s a lot more meaningful jaunts to happen upon, and the rolling tides of Titan feel like a legitimate spectacle now that the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions are long gone (even though the last Destiny expansion shirked them, their footprint was still apparent). Everything is more manageable and digestible too. “Meditations” allow you to repeat story missions (gone is the annoying icon-filled map), challenges are linked to activities like Strikes, and patrols are back. Instead of earning useless Motes of Light after you reach the level cap of 20, you’ll now unlock “Bright Engrams,” which provide a heap of cosmetic and gameplay upgrades.It’s a double-edged sword, because of course, they’re linked to microtransactions. While some of you are going to be pissed that these glorified lore-disguised loot crates exist at all, you’ll probably be even more angry at the fact that you can get weapon and armor mods from Bright Engrams — mods that directly impact gameplay and make your equipment marginally better. Shaders being downgraded to a single-use classification also stings.Based on my experience it hasn’t ruined the game in a meaningful way, but it uncomfortably flirts with pay-to-win, and feels straight up over the line. I think Bungie needs to go back on it as soon as possible in fact, as they’ve ruined so much good will from the original Destiny, which only dealt in cosmetics. As a premium game with a season pass (and likely more paid content beyond that, as was the case with Destiny), it’s far less excusable.Destiny 2 commits a lot of the same sins as its father, but it succeeded in doing something the original never did — make roaming around the open world fun and rewarding. It still has a lot of room to evolve with expansions and major updates, but the future is looking brighter than it once was.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher. My Warlock’s Power Level at the time of the review is 270, my Titan and Hunter completed the story, and the Nightfall was completed. For more thoughts, check out our initial review in progress.]AlrightSlightly above average or simply inoffensive. Fans of the genre should enjoy them a bit, but a fair few will be left unfulfilled.

Destiny 2,Paul Tassi,Forbes,https://www.forbes.com/sites/games/2017/09/18/destiny-2-review-ps4-one-small-step-one-giant-leap/,"Destiny 2The original Destiny, despite having one of the most mangled production histories in recent gaming memory, managed to craft something that attracted millions of die-hard fans, a game that would convince even its biggest critics to spend hundreds or thousands of hours playing. Bungie, creators of Halo, had pulled a second rabbit out of its hat. In the last three years, Destiny has become a hugely influential shooter, despite managing to trip over itself nearly every step of the way.Destiny 2 was a chance for a reset. An opportunity for Bungie to stop and take stock of the last few years and consider what worked and what didn’t in the original. The final result is a game that has improved upon itself in almost every way, trimming fat and bolstering weak points. But as ever, it’s hard not to want more from Destiny 2, as what we get just doesn’t quite feel like enough in many ways.While Destiny 2 allows players to port their Guardians from their original game to this new one, that’s all you’re allowed to bring over. Everything you own, every currency, every weapon, every piece of armor is destroyed. Literally destroyed, as the famed Last City and its protective Tower are laid to waste by Cabal invaders. They’re led by Ghaul, a commander who wants to take the immortal gift of the city’s giant space orb, the Traveler’s light, and acquire its power for himself. The Traveler is caged, Guardians lose their light, and it’s up to us, one single Guardian out of thousands, to crawl our way back to our former glory, reuniting our old mentors to reclaim the city, and the light, from Ghaul.If most of that sounded nonsensical, that’s understandable. Destiny has struggled to create a cohesive narrative with its use of nebulous concepts like “Light” and “Darkness” as major forces in the universe, but the sequel does manage to improve on the story of the original, which was ten times more bizarre than what I just described. I’ve played the original Destiny’s story probably 20 times by repeating missions, and I still probably cannot accurately tell you what happened there, or why.Destiny 2 is different. Though the story is somewhat generic, you must rally the troops to take down a big bad, it’s at least coherent, and often well-told, relying on the voicework of sci-fi staples Gina Torres, Lance Reddick and Nathan Fillion as the members of the Vanguard, Ikora, Zavala and Cayde-6 respectively. The game also introduces quirky new side characters, a glitchy AI, a stoic sniper, a skeptical resistance fighter, who manage to actually be some of the more interesting NPCs in the game by the end, once you’ve fleshed them out with a variety of story and side missions. The weakest link in the chain remains your own Guardian, who used to have a handful of lines in the original game, but now has zero, and only your Nolan North-voiced Ghost does the talking for you, which grows tiresome after the first few cutscenes that have you standing around in awkward silence while a blinking tetrahedron speaks on your behalf.Destiny 2Stripped of your power and gear, the hunt to reclaim both begins all over again. Soon you will reclaim at least some fraction of your lost light, allowing you to use “space magic” once again and try out one of the game’s new subclasses, which will have you throwing flaming swords as a Warlock, using a crackling electric staff as a Hunter, or marauding around with a Captain America-like shield as a Titan. The new subclasses are fun, as are tweaks to the old ones, but one major area in which Destiny 2 is lacking is the absence of a new fully-fledged class, an odd move for an RPG sequel where that would usually be mandatory. And even the new subclasses are killing off old ones they’re replacing, and many closely resemble others that already exist in the game.Still, that doesn’t mean they aren’t fun to use, and combined with Bungie’s eternally top-notch gunplay, Destiny 2 is one of the tightest-performing shooters in the market. This has been the series’ strength from the start, and while not much has changed from the original in this regard, not much needed to. The simple act of a headshot, of an enemy-blasting super move, of an unloaded shotgun clip into a boss’s ribcage feels better than in any genre equivalent. Destiny runs circles around its rivals in this department, as it allows you, the player, to feel supremely powerful at all times, a singular thresher maw of destruction from start to finish. The game's expert gunplay also translates into a more refined PvP system, which shifts the focus away from one or two power weapons and allows for more competitive, diverse play through the game's new dual primary loadouts, something I initially hated, but gradually understood to be an improvement. It's taken PvP from a mode I mostly avoided to something I actively seek out to mix up gameplay.Part of Destiny 2’s narrative improvements are linked to the structure of the game, which blends story missions, side-adventures and frequent cutscenes to move the story forward. The earlier sections are some of the game’s most memorable, as you track through a frozen wasteland with only a single pistol to defend yourself against pursuing War Hounds as a heartbreaking orchestral soundtrack plays. Destiny 2’s score is one of its crowning achievements, a haunting, thrilling tracklist that will stay with you long after stop playing.Players will trek across four new zones, the European Dead Zone on earth, the moons of Titan and Io, and the planetoid of Nessus. The EDZ is a hugely, sprawling area that is easily two or three times as big as any zone in Destiny 1. Yet, Titan, in contrast, is more or less only two open play areas with a bunch of branching hallways used mainly for missions and not general exploration. The size disparity across the zones is significant, but unlike the lack of any new character classes, at least this sequel did create four truly new zones rather than continuing to build on old assets like the first game did for years. Patrol mode in each of these areas now integrates almost all the activities of the game and is the most improved aspect of the sequel as you can hunt down hidden chests, fight secret bosses in Lost Sectors and participate in rewarding (possibly too rewarding) public events in your eternal quest for loot.Destiny 2But even with brand new activities found in these zones, the enemies that populate them area nearly identical to what we’ve seen before. All five of Destiny’s races return, the Fallen, Hive, Vex, Cabal and the Taken, the last of which is an amalgam of the first four, and one I hoped we’d leave behind. Only the Cabal adds more than one or two new types of fighters to their roster, and everyone else has to be content with minor tweaks. This creates a rather weird experience in Destiny 2, where you can easily be the same subclass using the same exotics fighting the same enemies that you were in Destiny 1. In those moments, the claims that Destiny 2 is really Destiny 1.5 feel like they hold true.In some ways, however, Destiny 2 adds by subtraction. I am frankly amazed by just how streamlined Destiny 2 made its economy compared to the first game. Staples of the old Destiny, planetary materials, strange coins, ammo synths, exotic shards, motes of light, have either been eliminated or had their role greatly reduced. No longer do you have to do anything to upgrade weapons or armor, as all drop with set, unchanging perks that are instantly unlocked the moment the item drops. Every vendor is now based on a “token” system where running strikes, playing Crucible, doing patrol, dismantling guns will let you turn in specific tokens to assigned NPCs to get yourself 1-2 pieces of legendary loot as you slowly increase your power level. It’s incredibly straightforward, and I would argue a vast improvement over the original, which had a mess of bounties, objectives and currencies that over-complicated everything the deeper you got into the game. The addition of Bright Engrams to the real-life-money Eververse store has been a point of contention, but given the rate in which you can earn them in-game without paying, and their complete focus on cosmetics, the concept does not appear to be anything that significantly hamstrings the game in the pursuit of greater revenue. But we’ll have to see how the system expands in time, like it did in D1.What these changes will mean for the endgame is a bit less clear. This week, Destiny 2 opened up its two endgame activities, a new 6-man Leviathan raid and ultra-competitive PvP, Trials of the Nine. Both are challenging in different ways, with Leviathan being arguably the most complicated raid in the game’s history and 100x the difficulty of anything you’ll encounter in story mode. Destiny’s endgame usually revolves around running these activities multiple times indefinitely, but the streamlining changes make me wonder if that will still happen this time around. Exotics drop like candy through frequent play (I have almost a full collection of exotic guns after just two weeks), and the changes to Legendaries, where all guns of the same name drop with the same perks, makes farming the “perfect” roll on your favorite weapon obsolete. So for these endgame activities, once you have X gun or X piece of armor, that’s it. Duplicates serve no purpose. While I don’t particularly mind this as I have too many other games to play to sink 2,000 hours into grinding for perfect drops in Destiny 2, I feel like die-hard players may run into a wall pretty quickly as it’s incredibly easy to amass most of the best gear in the game in short order with this new system.Destiny 2Still, I think these changes are for the better. Destiny 2, from its story to its gameplay systems, is a much more coherent experience than the original in almost every way. Combine that with its rock-solid gameplay, and you have a recipe for a sequel that takes several dramatic steps forward for the series, even if it remains weirdly stuck in place in a few areas like classes and enemy types.I have had nothing but fun with Destiny 2 in the last two weeks. When my most major complaint is that I just wanted more from it, that implies what is there is thoroughly worthwhile. I wish Bungie had more time to build even more into Destiny 2, but what they have added is great, and what they’ve taken away also makes for a better experience, for the most part (I’ve avoided a consumable shader rant for this entire review, somehow).It’s hard to imagine that Destiny 2 won’t satisfy fans of the original, but it’s also the type of game that will allow new players to jump right in, and skip some of the worst growing pains of the series. While there’s still room for improvement, and for this universe to live up to its full potential, Destiny 2 makes undeniable progress, and reinforces the idea that this is a series we’ll be playing for at least an entire decade, when all is said and done.Platform: PlayStation 4, Xbox One (later PC)Developer: BungiePublisher: ActivisionRelease Date: September 6, 2017Price: $59.99Score: 9/10Follow me on Twitter and on Facebook.

Destiny 2,Ozzie Mejia,Shacknews,http://www.shacknews.com/article/101421/destiny-2-review-light-bright,"New to Shacknews? Signup for a Free AccountAlready have an account? Login NowDoes the Traveler's Light shine brightly on Destiny 2, Activision and Bungie's sequel to their 2014 MMO shooter? Our review.Full disclosure before starting off this review: I did not play the original Destiny, at least not very much of it. Aside from press events and conventions, my time with Activision and Bungie's first attempt at a first-person shooter MMORPG was limited. In total, I had spent less than a few hours on 2014's Destiny.So I went into Destiny 2 with limited knowledge of the original and an open mind. And what I experienced was an enjoyable (albeit flawed) story-based campaign with a healthy variety of weaponry and a lot of activities to take part in with other players that happened to be passing by. It didn't take long before I felt hooked and had thoughts of, ""Oh, so this must be what the fuss was about with the first game."" It's a solid MMORPG that's just as enjoyable for solo players as it is for groups of friends.Given the way Destiny 2's campaign starts out, there's a sense that little about the first game's story actually matters. A massive brute named Dominus Ghaul leads a Red Legion invasion of the Last City, upending the Guardians and cutting off their connection to the Traveler and the power-bringing Light that it provides. While the intro mission familiarizes players with the game's controls and mechanics, it's the subsequent missions that offers up an emotional sense of powerlessness that helps establish the narrative.After regaining a connection with the Light and starting the campaign in earnest, it's easy to feel overwhelmed by the massive worlds that Bungie designed. Fortunately, thanks to the numerous public events that players of all levels can take part of, it's easy for newcomers to become acclimated to how Destiny 2 works and how to go about finding better equipment. There's no limit to how many public events players can participate in with total strangers, offering a sense of comraderie, while also flying solo. One of the best moments of my early hours with Destiny 2 was in warding off a Vex assault by teaming up with other players to knock down some hulking six-legged walker mechs. It was nice to hang around with these people, knowing the solo-player campaign missions would still be waiting later.Speaking of the Vex, one of the things I had a problem with, in terms of Destiny 2's story it that it likes to toss out numerous enemy races, but does little to narratively distinguish them. There are instances in the game where two enemy factions will be fighting each other and I'll come to realize that they all look similar. The game does little to give these enemies an identity, providing little in the way of lore. Sure, Ghaul and the Red Legion get plenty of exposition through the campaign's stunningly beautiful cutscenes, but nothing else really makes Destiny 2 feel like a complete world, lore-wise. Side missions help little in that regard, though things do start to pick up with the post-campaign activities.The other issue I had with the campaign is that it feels unnecessarily padded. No, it's not just the level grinding. In fact, the grinding doesn't feel so terrible, thanks to the variety of side missions and public events that pack each of Destiny 2's worlds. It's actually the fact that the Sparrows don't unlock until after the campaign is over, meaning Guardians have to hoof it across these vast worlds to make it to their next mission. There are Fast Travel points available, but even those are often located a good distance from a mission marker. Getting across worlds takes a good chunk of time and is often a frustrating venture, especially since it's easy to get lost or get bombarded by enemy fire along the way. It artificially adds hours to the campaign and it gets to be aggravating after a while.There's no shortage of ways to pick up rare and exotic loot in Destiny 2 and it expands much more when the campaign is over. A smorgasbord of activities become available once the formal campaign ends, with players able to take part in Strikes, Patrols, Flashpoints, side missions, Raids, and more. Aside from the big Leviathan Raid, none of the activities take too much time and they feel substantially rewarding, especially when doing all of it as part of a clan.But while loot is plentiful, there are limited ways to customize that loot and show it off. Destiny 2's Shader system is needlessly limited, only allowing for one-time use to put a unique visual touch on a weapon or armor. Given that loot often drops like candy out of a piñata in Destiny 2, it doesn't take long to find the new hotness. However, at that point, the Shader application can't be undone and it's essentially wasted. That leads to hesitation to use Shaders that have been earned through gameplay and it means players like myself will hesitate more before customizing weaponry, which takes some of the fun out of the whole enterprise.Worse yet, it is frustratingly easy to pick up duplicate drops from engrams, especially on the Exotic and Legendary level. The frequency of duplicates is disheartening given how much time is invested in collecting materials to turn into the various Destiny 2 supporting cast. What good is collecting Tokens if it just means getting the same thing I already have equipped? Given the rich availability of different items in Destiny 2, it feels like duplicates shouldn't be this much of a problem.Destiny 2 offers three character classes: Titan, Warlock, and Hunter. Each class is simplified to suit a character's play style, offering distinct weaponry and abilities to complement their tank, support, and DPS roles. Figuring out which class works best for you is a big part of the experience, as is discovering which pieces of gear work best for those classes.Each class also gets several subclasses to build around, each of which specializes in a select handful of abilities and offers a different super ability. Playing around with the Sentinel's powerful melee Void shield and the Sunbreaker's giant hammer has been fun to experiment with, with certain subclass types feeling more suited for different situations than others. For example, I don't really need a Defender's bubble shield when taking on a giant campaign boss, but it does come in handy during a Strike or a Raid. Fortunately, Destiny 2 allows for players to equip two subclasses and switch between them.The downside of building these classes is that upgrading feels noticeably linear. Leveling a character and earning an upgrade point only gives me a single spot to use that upgrade point. I can't really customize my character, because I'm essentially forced to shoehorn that upgrade point in a certain place before I can access my character's other abilities. The choice expands slightly upon unlocking a second subclass, but I wish I could vary my character build more as I'm leveling up.In spite of its shortcomings, Destiny 2 shines thanks to its replayability. There are many different ways to enjoy the game, both alone and with friends. As a solo player, I've even come to familiarize myself with different players, as we went through a Strike mission and later attempted and failed the Leviathan Raid. (Advice: Do not attempt the Leviathan Raid with strangers.)The campaign is enjoyable while it lasts, thanks mostly to smart single-player AI (which becomes noticeably dumber in multiplayer), a truly epic soundtrack, and great voice acting performances. Nathan Fillion, in particular, is a hoot as Cayde-6. But with so many different elements of the game that open up after the campaign, there's so much to do and something truly for everyone. Even the 4v4 PvP modes in the Crucible are a fun diversion, with varied playlists and some brilliant map design.Destiny 2 proves that the journey is more rewarding than the destination. Sure, I'll pick up duplicate or useless loot, but at least I had a good time along the way. And honestly, it's the kind of good time I could see myself having for a long time.Ozzie has been playing video games since picking up his first NES controller at age 5. He has been into games ever since, only briefly stepping away during his college years. But he was pulled back in after spending years in QA circles for both THQ and Activision, mostly spending time helping to push forward the Guitar Hero series at its peak. Ozzie has become a big fan of platformers, puzzle games, shooters, and RPGs, just to name a few genres, but he’s also a huge sucker for anything with a good, compelling narrative behind it. Because what are video games if you can't enjoy a good story with a fresh Cherry Coke?

Destiny 2,Sherif Saed,VG247,https://www.vg247.com/2017/11/02/destiny-2-pc-review-the-best-loot-shooter-is-made-better-by-the-move-to-a-new-home/,"Destiny 2 comes to PC to shake up the torpid loot shooter scene, and it's all the better for it.There’s a gratifying feeling PC players know very well. The relief of downloading a new game and seeing it run great out of the gate without much tinkering. Whether it’s the many years of bad ports, or the specific desires of players on a platform as malleable as PC, there’s always been this looming worry that the next big game will screw something up somewhere.The PC version of Destiny 2 effortlessly nullifies these worries in the first few minutes, but it’s how it plays beyond the opening moments that turns it from a good PC port into a good game. Practically every website covered Destiny 2 in September. Most people reading this probably already know that the story is nothing to write home about, and that the endgame leaves something to be desired for the most hardcore fans.The number of environments, weapons, activities, rewards and everything else around what you actually get up to in Destiny 2 is well documented in our Destiny 2 guide and hundreds of other places online.The praise and grievances are all relevant here, no less valid than they were at the console launch. Nothing on that end has changed; this is still the same game many played in September. So instead of wasting time rehashing old critique, I am keen to tell you about my experience as a PC player in a game ostensibly designed as a console shooter first. 
 
The first thing that immediately hit me was the much higher frame-rate. Before I had time to properly judge weapon mechanics or how character movement feels on a keyboard, I was in awe of how smooth the game runs during quiet and hectic moments alike. I had no problems maxing out all settings at 1440p and averaging 120fps. Admittedly, it's a near-top-of-the-line PC, but you won't need much if you aim for 60fps.There is no question about the responsiveness upgrade you feel at higher frame-rates. Destiny 2 already felt great at 30fps, I would even argue it feels better than some 60fps shooters on consoles.But on PC, with frame-rates as high as your machine can pump out, the game is unshackled. Your inputs feel all the more tactile. Unloading the entire clip of a hand cannon, then throwing a grenade and dodging into a reload as a Hunter feels like some ideal version of Overwatch’s McCree we never got. The precision of a mouse offers infinite utility, and much greater control. More than that, it opens up new avenues for you to appreciate and enjoy weapon classes Destiny players have been using in a certain way for years.A slow-firing auto rifle was something I often avoided on console. If I needed a low rate-of-fire precision weapon, I’d use a scout rifle. On PC, I could easily turn this auto rifle into a scout rifle by tap-firing without losing any of the precision. Sure, a scout rifle will always have higher impact, but I had more control over something so small than I ever did on a controller.I worried hand cannons would be cumbersome and unnecessarily slow after playing the beta, but the sheer number of them in the full game negated this almost immediately. In fact, it made me appreciate some of the finer variances between the slow, classic revolver-style hand cannons and the more modern options. But gunplay isn’t the only thing that feels great on PC. Character movement is similarly well adapted to keyboard’s digital inputs. 
 
Your average Destiny session features a lot of platforming, and while the original game changed my mind on the point of having this at all in a first-person game, Destiny 2 convinced me that first-person platforming can still feel good without analogue inputs. This is a big deal; PC shooters for years have been struggling with the best way to implement first-person platforming. The old Half-Life nightmare level comes to mind.The games that figured this out – like Portal – had much less of an emphasis on combat. While Destiny 2 doesn't ask a lot of you in most firefights, pulling off cool moves is what keeps combat interesting. Platforming and air movement are big parts of that, and they must respect your momentum without feeling floaty and weightless – see Borderlands for the worst way to do this.None of these issues are anywhere to be found here. I deliberately picked a Warlock in the launch version because I remember hating its jump and air control on a pad. I still think it’s the worst of the three classes in this regard, but I have never quite appreciated the reason for why Warlock jumps have so much glide until I played on PC. Perhaps through sheer luck or genius forward-thinking, the UI in Destiny was designed to work well with a mouse from the start. On console, you control what’s essentially a big mouse cursor. This translates well to PC, for the most part.Navigating a planet’s map doesn’t respond too well to the speed of a mouse. The camera pans at a speed typical of analogue sticks, and you can't use arrow or WASD keys to navigate it like some RTS games. It’s not a big issue, but together with the unnecessary push towards holding buttons instead of pressing them, makes certain parts of the UI, such as checking the weekly Milestones, feel finicky.You’ll quickly forget Destiny 2’s roots as a console shooter once you get used to these quirks. The game plays just as well as any PC open-world shooter. Getting around the world is easy. Jumping off a Sparrow into a Public Event before getting lost trying to locate the chest you’re hearing the chime for feels natural on mouse and keyboard. The incredibly fast load times (even on a regular HDD) means that even the in-orbit moments are cut to 20 or 30 seconds, and I never once hit the in-world loading issues I got so many times on consoles.  
 
Bungie always struck me as a developer too precious about the games it makes and the worlds within them. The old joke of capitalising every other word in dialogue still holds true. For all my time watching, playing, and covering Destiny, the studio’s vision for everything within it - from the way the action feels, how rewards are doled out, and down to how stories are told - is one that’s always been very specific. It was a surprise to see a studio that’s so wrapped up in how its creations are perceived recognise that the needs and expectations of a whole new platform could mean that some of these beliefs will have to be abandoned. Let me be frank. The PC port of a game as a popular as Destiny would have probably sold just fine even if it was terrible. Taken a step further, a competent but otherwise lacking port accompanied by hollow claims about how the game should ""feel"" from Bungie would have still done well commercially. Destiny 2 on PC could have easily been just another console port that looks and runs a bit nicer than consoles, but doesn’t really do any one thing well enough to truly feel at home on PC.So to see how far Bungie and Vicarious Visions have gone to make this a good PC shooter first, and a good port as well, tells me that nothing was off the table during development. And beyond that, it signifies a commitment to PC from the most unlikely places. 
 
Destiny 2 on PC is a completely different experience to the one on consoles, not just because of its technical implementation, but in how it feels when you do the things we’ve been doing on consoles for years. Destiny 2 players on PS4 and Xbox One who are serious enough about the game need to consider migrating to PC. Technical analysis revealed that you can easily achieve 1080p/60fps on plenty of affordable hardware configurations.The game still plays great on a controller on PC, and no amount of exclusive content will matter when you see it running this well. Sure, you’ll have to stomach the upfront cost of a PC, but I am willing to bet you’ll find other uses for the new machine than just playing Destiny 2.Before the release of Destiny 2, PC players looking for a loot shooter had one of two options. Replay any of the Borderlands games, and suffer through plenty of samey drops and mediocre shooting mechanics. Or download Warframe, a free-to-play Diablo-esque shooter that feels good to play but has a grindy progression system and uninteresting environments.Players on PC no longer have to contend with less when the best one is right there on their preferred platform.You're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!

My feature-length look at Destiny 2's first 15 hours can be summed up as follows: the Destiny series has returned with a better story, superior zones to shoot bad guys in, and a more pronounced sense of purpose. It has also returned looking a helluva lot like the series' first always-online, first-person shooting game.Those initial sessions left me optimistic about the state of the sequel, which is why I chose to cover it in ""pre-review"" form at all (let alone in a positive manner). Still, I wanted to tell a more complete story of how much content ships in this game—and whether Destiny 2's network requirements might get in the way.One week of questing, shooting, and engram-collecting later, I have a verdict. I do this knowing fully well that Destiny 2 has content-related surprises up its robo-armored sleeves, thanks to weekly events and the like. But I have mostly reached the edges of the game's on-disc content and can see the full picture of what Bungie expects its fans to play for weeks and months on end.Destiny 2 is what the first game should have been all along, which means, at long last, there's a Destiny game finally worth recommending.I'll start with the game's campaign, because it's the river from which all other Destiny 2 conversations must flow.The story doesn't expand much beyond what I saw during my pre-review sessions. An evil force known as the Red Legion has come to crack open the original game's ""Traveler"" (a massive, mysterious orb that floats over Earth and grants this series' heroes many powers, including immortality). You're one of the rare Guardian heroes who somehow regained your original powers after a terrible Red Legion attack. You are tasked with facing off against the Red Legion, disrupting its nefarious plans, and reclaiming the Traveler's powerful ""light"" force.There's a basic throughline to the campaign. Your mission: explore new planets and moons. Find, assist, and regroup with the original game's Guardian ""leaders"" (Ikora, Cayde-6, and Zavala). From there, restore enough of your lost power, via experience points and increasingly better loot, to take on major Red Legion baddie Dominus Ghaul. (He's the one who opens the game by downgrading your Traveler-fueled powers in the first place.)The trick about Destiny 2 is that the campaign isn't exactly a straight-line, choreographed run through missions. There's definitely a progression, marked by highlight missions that you have to do in order. But the game is designed with a free-flowing, come-back-for-more system. This approach delivers combat around every corner and plot around some of those corners.On paper, it's all very similar to Destiny 1. You'll fly to one of the four default planets, then run around and pick up a variety of quests that pop up in your vicinity. The first Destiny, however, was pretty awful at leading players to intriguing paths and battlegrounds. The starting four planets in D1 proved to be short and architecturally boring. D2, on the other hand, has planets and moons stuffed to the gills with structural density, intriguing biomes, and paths that weave above, below, and through the ground for the sake of compelling marches through gangs of entrenched foes. I've described some of the planets' differences in the gallery above, but I must impress upon you: these new planets are gorgeous, dense, and varied. The same goes for the missions packed into their bones.All of Destiny 2's new Strikes are much bigger in scope and scale than any of the Strikes in the original game—which I would say about the rest of Destiny 2's primary co-op content, really. Expect huge alien outposts, massive leaps up and down in elevation, and dastardly pacing in terms of enemy and boss waves descending on the Strikes' craziest battlegrounds. But with so few Strikes on offer at launch, Bungie lets players choose whether or not to get bored with the selection by overplaying these five missions.My advice: pace yourself on the Strikes, since D2's overworld has so much more emerging content than D1. That will be cold comfort to those who prefer when a co-op game discretely sets its start, middle, and finish conditions. But I had more fun focusing on the first week's bonkers-hard Nightfall tweak on a Strike mission dubbed The Arms Dealer; I enjoyed learning its every nook and cranny, optimizing its battles, and making sense of its tricky Nightfall conditions, which included a timer and a cycling of which ""energy"" weapons worked best every 30 seconds.As of press time, Destiny 2's six-player Raid missions were about to go live. My character still isn't high-powered enough to access them. I complain about, then accept, that math-related issue below.Pretty much every night since the game's launch, I've lost hours falling into the D2's default gameplay loop. I'll land on a planet of my choosing, then activate a ""patrol"" mission. This leads me to one or two delectable battles, with largely the same enemy types and species from D1 (with more variety among each species' ranks) dancing around with very sharp dodge-and-flank or you-charge, I-snipe tactics.After that, I can pop an ""adventure"" flag to run-and-fight across three or four increasingly tough battlegrounds (which the game leads me between via checkpoint markers). Along the way in that adventure mission, I will almost certainly run into either a ""public event""—which is a time-limited opportunity to take down a massive boss or major objective—or a ""legendary enemy""—which is just a tough, oversized creature who pops up somewhere on the map with a vague hint of lights and sounds when you're close enough. Through all these paths, there's always a combination of an intense, underground rumble, a massive, open-field assault with other online players at my side, and a dart-between-buildings rush to take down foes.As a result, I've, uh, been late to work every day this week.Let's go back to the campaign, because every mission tries to tell some piece of the story. Like I said in my pre-review, Destiny 2 reveals plenty of subtle and solid story via squad chatter in your ears during missions, and this happens all the time—even if you're doing a seemingly simple ""kill 12 snipers"" patrol mission or repeating a longer mission for the eighth time. Destiny 2 understands that you're coming back to the same planets and possibly repeating or rehashing certain terrain many times. It wants to feel solid, fun, and an itsy bit revealing every single time.So it's not just good enough for me to say that Destiny 2's campaign is a tidier, more enjoyable, and far more sensible story of redemption and survival than D1. What's clever here is that Destiny 2 just keeps on dumping little bits of story even after you've ""beaten"" the campaign... especially since some awesome and memorable ""campaign"" missions unlock only after you've seen the game's ending, anyway. (If you want a time estimate for the campaign, by the way, I'd measure it at about 12 hours, so long as you include those after-campaign missions and a healthy portion of the affiliated, optional adventures. You can run through the mandatory missions far more quickly, though.)In exchange for that drip-feed of character interactions and story tidbits, you have to accept that Bungie isn't interested in crafting a story about one great hero. You don't get a single, well-written protagonist to root for as you make your way across Destiny 2's planets. Bungie wants you to root for yourself—and to trick you into thinking these voice actors and their reams of dialogue are actually a bunch of people who are super into your Guardian status. The writing staff just about pulls it off—and I offer that as a huge compliment, since I found myself shocked to suspend disbelief for even a millisecond to think that Nathan Fillion's voice as Cayde-6 was cheering, loudly and specifically, for me, the Titan with the shiny, sun-bullet gun.Strangely, Bungie rushes you into not giving a crap about roughly one-third of this content.At a certain point in your progress, Destiny 2 starts dumping unbelievable loads of experience points into your soldier's coffers. The current D2 level cap is 20, and the climb from 15 to the max took me about an hour. That was way faster than the 10 or so hours I needed to reach level 15. Once you're level 20, your path to increased strength or power is through loot. (Think dungeon crawler games like Diablo.) At max level, you can only get stronger weapons or new abilities by making sure you equip all of your highest-number items, then hoping that you pick up weapons and armor which will push those numbers up just a teensy, weensy bit with every loot pickup. [UPDATE: Bungie confirmed back in August that you no longer need to equip higher-level items in order to reap the best possible rewards. Thanks to readers for pointing this out.]As it turns out, by the end of my first week with the game, I had nearly maxed out every possible way to get ""better"" loot. Each week, players can take on missions and tasks in a number of categories, including the player-versus-player Crucible, the special Strike missions (which must be played in a larger group), the extra-long, extra-hard Raid missions (which require even more players and power and weren't live in the game's first week), and more.Once you reach level 20, you'll only need about 10 hours of play throughout all that awesome content I listed earlier in the article, just romping around planets and picking up plot-filled adventures, before Destiny 2 starts to laugh at you. Sorry, mate, it veritably says. Most of that discretely programmed content littering our alien planets is meant for lesser players, and we've fast forwarded you to a whole new tier of ""exotic"" loot. At this point, you can't just run around planets, raise hell, and be satisfied that your every action is accruing you a planet-specific currency to possibly get cooler loot. To max out your Destiny 2 strength, you have to start checking these weekly checklists of specific tasks, warping to those points, and doing what you're told.Otherwise, you will be forbidden from the game's Raid playlist of content, which requires a ""power level"" (the number determined by all of your equipped weapons and armor combined) of at least 280. As I write this, I have plateaued at 270, which is fine. I'll get my number bigger at some point. But I also have a few nifty unplayed ""adventure"" missions on my maps, and they aren't doing squat for my progress. That just seems silly on Bungie's part. Why not let the numbers grow a little more slowly?[UPDATE: After this article went live, I was informed that Bungie had announced a Raid ""power level"" requirement of 260. Thus, I'm totally leveled up enough to start playing the Raid content, which goes live on Wednesday. I apologize for the error.]My suspicion, which nobody has confirmed: Bungie wants you to reach level 20 ASAP... because the game's microtransactions can't be purchased with real money until you reach level 20. These are almost all cosmetic, and the power-specific ones are wimpy, but there's still a real stink of bean counters rushing players through some of Destiny 2's coolest stuff just so we can start paying for loot boxes.I'm not sure this dooms Destiny 2 in terms of longer-term play. Bungie expects players to reach a level cap and get into a rhythm of playing and replaying certain content in hopes of earning those crazier, rarer guns and pieces of armor. But, gosh, they didn't have to rush it that fast. This is a sequel, not an expansion pack. Right?Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

Destiny 2,Mick Fraser,God is a Geek,http://www.godisageek.com/reviews/destiny-2-review/,"September 6, 2017In hindsight, the Destiny 2 Beta was probably a bad idea. For some it had opposite the desired effect, showcasing an admittedly thrilling opening level but leaving many cold to the fact that it seemed very much to be simply more Destiny. Now it’s finally out, though, I’m happy to confirm that, while it retains everything that made the first game great, it adds a heap of new stuff to more than justify its sequel status.First of all, it now has a story. A coherent, surprisingly captivating story. There’s no sign of the mysterious Exo warrior from the first game, which probably confirms that we’ll never understand what the Darkness was or what we were really up against in the vanilla campaign of the first game. The sequel instead takes its story beats and atmospherics from The Taken King and Rise of Iron expansions, showing that Bungie has grown and learned as a developer. Destiny 2’s campaign is much more in line with those latter-day add-ons, interspersing the sublime gunplay with full cutscenes, characterisation, and a villain who almost – almost – becomes truly interesting before the story does what video game stories have to do, and renders him just another big boss to fight. That said, though, it’s a pretty decent final tussle.So first, the backstory. Set some time after the events of Rise of Iron, Destiny 2 sees the Guardian headquarters invaded and the Last City half-razed by Ghaul, a Cabal general who fancies himself an Emperor. He wants the Traveler’s Light to make himself immortal, and he thinks the way to get it is to strap a huge machine to it and essentially strip-mine it. With their connection to the Light lost, even the three heroes of the Vanguard, Zavala, Cayde-6, and Ikora Rey, are left fearing that their next death will be their last. It falls to you, then, as the only Guardian still bound to the Traveller, to save the Last City. Once again, though, your grand destiny is tempered somewhat when XxXArsef4ceXxX has also apparently been deemed worthy despite the fact he’s done nothing on this mission but stand beside you doing the “flossing” dance while you square up to humanity’s greatest threat. Sometimes, the shared world works against the central “lone wolf” conceit, especially in the otherwise-brilliant final mission.But the story’s good. It’s great, actually, and does more than just frame the action in a pointless narrative. Which is not to say there isn’t loads of action. In fact, Destiny 2 is fairly brimming with things to do from the first few missions, drip-feeding new activities every couple of levels or so. Whereas the first game locked everything but the campaign and bounties behind the level cap, the sequel throws things in regularly. There’s a ton of new distractions, such as Adventures that take you on little, bullet-filled sojourns around the various worlds, and Lost Sectors, which are little mini dungeons with a boss-guarded loot chest at the end. Oddly, other things are locked instead, such as your Sparrow. Now, some might say that’s because the new fast travel option means you need your Sparrow less often, which is true, but others might proffer the theory that it’s because at level 20 you can buy Silver, and with Silver you can gamble for rare Sparrows in Bright Engrams.Either could be true, but it’s testament to Destiny 2‘s structure that I only missed my zippy little speeder at one point in the whole campaign, and keep forgetting I’ve got one now I’m in the end-game. Incidentally, calling it “end-game” is even more of a misnomer than ever, as the rolling of the credits is actually the beginning of the true Destiny 2 adventure. Now everything is open to you, and everything is in service to the monkey on every Guardian’s back: the Light Level (here renamed “Power Level”). No spoilers, but things change in the end-game, which is a nice touch to solidify your achievement. But now the galaxy is your oyster, and you can return to any of the four main worlds (Earth, Titan, Nessus, and Io) to explore, join other Guardians and run Strikes and Nightfalls and Heroic Events and Adventures and Crucible matches, as well as tying up end-game mini questlines.Everything you do on a world earns you Tokens for a specific Faction of the resistance against Ghaul. You’re working with normal humans for the most part (as well as one slightly sinister AI), and they require you to do a lot of donkey work. Luckily, they reward you handsomely, and their tokens (as well Lord Shaxx’s, Zavala’s, Ikora’s, and the Gunsmith’s) earn you rep and purple engrams. Even the Nightfall Strike each week looks to be as hard and as lucrative as ever. If you’re more of a competitive sort, the Crucible has also had some tweaks. Most matches are now 4v4, and the new maps work well to exploit that. They’re a hodge-podge of environments torn roughly from areas in the campaign, but they all look beautiful and highly detailed. The European Dead Zone map is as joyous as its predecessor, while new arenas like Altar of Flame make for some excellent gunfights. Of course, it’s all very even at this stage as few people have worked out all the exploits and camp spots, but that will change with time. New game mode Survival is fun, as each team resurrects from a finite pool of lives. When they’re gone, death is permanent until the next round. It’s fun and quick, the smaller teams and tighter spaces adding a sense of urgency, and the shared lives upping the ante on both teamwork and self-preservation.The final big change is Clan integration. No longer something born from necessity because you can’t matchmake for Raids and the Trials of Osiris, Clans are now an important element. When you’re all clanned up, everything you do earns you Clan XP which unlocks perks for you entire group that last a while Season (the length of which we don’t currently know), while sterling performance in certain high-level activities earns Clan-wide rewards. It makes you more likely to play in a Clan, which means you’re less likely to need to use the new Guided Games feature. GGs are a way to matchmake for things like Raids, as the system will match you with other Clans currently looking to make up numbers. LFG should be a thing of the past. Ironically, the fears raised by the beta are largely founded, despite all the new content, because, when you get right down to brass engrams, the gameplay is very, very similar to Destiny. I mean, this is kind of Destiny filtered through Halo 3 (there’s even a tank mission), but it’s certainly more of an evolution than a revolution. Changes to weapon loadouts, the inclusion of new guns (grenade launchers and tracer rifles), and the addition of gear mods notwithstanding, it’s the same shooter: gunplay polished to a gleaming shine, but now with extra explosions and a plot to back it up. If anything, it’s a little too easy. I’m a Destiny veteran, admittedly, but I had no problems whatsoever soloing the entire campaign.But I’m more than fine with that, if I’m honest. There are issues with microtransactions, if you’re the type of person on which they, rightly, grate, but on the whole what Destiny 2 charges you for are not essential. You can earn everything you can buy easily enough without the need to spend your money. That aside, I have no real problem with any other element of Destiny 2. It looks glorious, especially some of the locations on Earth and the stormy seas of Titan, and it plays incredibly well. It’s also full to bursting, which was at the top of almost everyone’s wishlist. DLC has already been confirmed, of course, but there’s easily enough here already to fully justify the launch price. The story isn’t huge, but there’s a ton of stuff to do besides the campaign and it’s all ridiculously fun. Bungie have mostly listened to us. They haven’t got it all right (things like Shaders seem to have been intentionally tweaked to part us with our pennies), but Destiny 2 has got it where it counts. It’s big and bold and bursting with content and heart, and there’s a genuine sense of adventure to it all. Quite simply, it’s one of the best first person shooters of the last few years and more than deserving of your time and energy.Great story

Destiny 2,Dennis Scimeca,GamesBeat,https://venturebeat.com/2017/09/07/destiny-2-review-in-progress-all-the-markings-of-a-brilliant-sequel/,"Connect with top gaming leaders in Los Angeles at GamesBeat Summit 2023 this May 22-23. Register here.The story of the original Destiny is of a series of expansions that made up for deficiencies as Bungie took its lessons from a passionate fan community. It is clear that the studio took criticism to heart and wove those lesssons into the core of Destiny 2. Almost every problem suffered by the original Destiny at release has been addressed by Destiny 2 save the franchise’s continuing social challenges.Our early impressions of Destiny 2 originally published on Sept. 7 were based on 20 hours of play at an Activision event held several weeks before the release of the game and 10 hours with the live servers. Our final review published on Sept. 15 is based on playing Destiny 2 for around 50 hours on the Xbox One with another 20 hours invested on the PlayStation 4.If you look at Destiny 2 holistically as a piece of game design you have to marvel at the quality of its construction. The art design, sound design, detail in level construction, and musical score are all fantastic. Destiny 2 is beautiful to look at. It’s wonderful to see what Bungie could do when the studio wasn’t tied to the need to develop for the less-powerful Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, like the studio had to for the original Destiny. Destiny 2 on PC is going to look amazing for anyone with a powerful gaming rig.Bungie also develops some of the smoothest and most responsive first-person shooters in the industry and the depth of Bungie’s expertise is on full display in Destiny 2. Combat is enjoyable purely for its own sake. Weapons provide real variety and encourage experimentation. The new character subclasses are awesome. Destiny 2 sets a high bar for how good a first person shooter can be purely in terms of design.GamesBeat Summit 2023Join the GamesBeat community in Los Angeles this May 22-23. You’ll hear from the brightest minds within the gaming industry to share their updates on the latest developments.Cayde-6, voiced by Nathan Fillion of Firefly and Castle fame, might be called the only developed character in the original Destiny, that otherwise mostly featured a large cast that were empty vessels handing out quests or doling out rewards.Destiny 2 has a smaller ensemble than the first game. Interacting with the same characters more often gives the player more opportunities to get to know them. And when players approach them to receive quest assignments, the characters deliver unique dialogue specific to that quest intro. This is not throwaway dialogue. It conveys interesting lore about the world of Destiny 2. You will want to listen to these characters if you care about the story and denizens of Destiny 2, and that means you will get to know them better over time as compared to the original Destiny.Even after finishing the story in Destiny 2, Cayde-6 still feels like the flagship character of the Destiny universe. Hawthorne, a “normal” human who works with the immortal Guardians is a nice addition to the cast, however. We still have not encountered characters who feel like throwaways and look forward to future Destiny 2 story expansions to see how Bungie enlarges the narrative.Above: Nathan Fillion returns to provide comic relief as Cayde-6 in Destiny 2.In the original Destiny, players had to go to Bungie.net or use the Destiny companion app to read the Grimoire, a series of cards that players unlocked by achieving feats and completing milestones, in order to read the game’s lore.  Having to step outside the game to learn about its world was a shame.In The Taken King expansion for the original Destiny, Bungie added a mechanic in which your AI companion Ghost would scan objects of interest in the world and deliver a report on the significance of the object, thus delivering small pieces of lore. Destiny 2 makes liberal use of this mechanic. This time, the lore is in the game.The lack of post-story content was a chief complaint from players of the original Destiny. Destiny 2 does not have this problem. We have discussed the almost overwhelming amount of content in Destiny 2’s open maps: Adventures, Lost Sectors, Patrols, Public Events, and wandering high-value targets, and Challenges show up automatically for you to finish as you wander the maps.This fantastic amount of open-world content joins Strikes, 15 to 20 minute missions that end with a boss, the player-versus-player Crucible, six-player Raids that combine gymnastics, puzzle-solving, and precision shooting, and the punishing Trial of the Nine weekly PvP tournament as endgame, post-story content.Light measured the combat potential of your character in the first Destiny. Weapons and armor had a Light rating, and your total Light was the average of those numbers. The loot algorithms would look at your character’s Light and, if you were lucky, rewards would be of slightly higher Light value than the gear you had equipped. This is how you leveled up.Players of the original Destiny might have two “outfits” on them at all times, the selection of weapons and gear they actually fought with and the ones that had the highest Light values, this second outfit being donned just before the player cashed in quest rewards.Destiny 2 replaces “Light” with “Power.” The systems are identical for all intents and purposes. You don’t, however, need to wear your highest Power gear in Destiny 2 to get loot with higher Power values. Destiny 2 will read your best potential equipment loadout and your loot drops will then reflect those numbers, meaning you ought to always be getting loot with higher Power no matter what gear you have equipped.Above: The weapon and armor systems in Destiny 2 are much less frustrating than in Destiny 1.In the first Destiny, weapons and armor not worth keeping could be broken down into weapon parts and armor materials respectively that would be worthless once you had huge stacks of both. Destiny 2’s weapons and armor of Rare or higher quality break down into parts you can turn over to the Gunsmith to earn gear.Rarely did a piece of gear in Destiny 2 feel like outright garbage, either because it was almost always a few Power points higher than other gear in our inventory or because it broke down into gunsmith parts. This made the game feel less like a grind than the original Destiny did at release. This may change by the endgame when you’ve maxed out your Power rating and are looking for specific weapons and armor. Every piece of gear we received in the early and mid-game however had some sort of value.Weapons in the original Destiny had randomized attributes that could make some versions of a gun better or worse than others by same name. You couldn’t get excited when you found a weapon you were looking for because the randomized attributes or “roll” of that version of the weapon might render it awful.Destiny 2 has no weapon rolls. Every gun is the same as every other one of the same name. The chase to earn that weapon feels less like a grind because you don’t need to worry about having to find the same gun over and over again to land a version with the perk rolls you need.Standardized versions of weapons also make inventory management easier. If you receive a new version of a weapon you already own and the new version has a higher Power rating, you don’t need to compare the perk rolls to decide which version to keep. You can immediately break down the lower Power version of the weapon and not worry about it.Above: It is easier to get attached to your gear in Destiny 2.Matching damage types to enemy shield types is important in Destiny’s most challenging content. If a bad guy has a Solar shield and you don’t have a Solar weapon to break it quickly, then the chances of your dying are much higher as you pound away against those Solar shields. In Destiny 2, matching damage types can make an enemy’s shields explode, which does area of effect damage.Players of the original Destiny therefore had to swap out weapons in order to do the type of damage they needed when facing specific types of enemies. That often meant abandoning a favorite gun. Destiny 2 players can use weapon mods to change damage types, so rather than having to stop using that Void shotgun because you need a weapon that does Arc damage, you can attach an Arc damage mod to the shotgun and you’re good to go.Calling all gaming execs!

Destiny 2,Rich McCormick,"Rock, Paper, Shotgun",https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/10/25/destiny-2-review-pc/,"Embrace it?It’s 4AM and I’m whispering with strangers in the dark. I found them online through a private channel, arranged a meeting in secret, and set my alarm to wake under cover of night. We’ve already got a plan, but we need to talk it through, to get on board with each other. We need to make sure we won’t get caught this time.I promised my wife I’d stop doing this, but these are the sacrifices I have to make in order to finish Destiny 2’s Leviathan raid.Leviathan is the crown jewel of Bungie’s MMO-ish shooter: a turbo-complex multi-stage mission that requires six people to complete. Those six people can’t just show up, either. They need to be willing to commit consecutive hours of their lives to communicating, implementing, and then executing multiple multi-stage plans. They’re expected to know each of those plans ahead of time, and to be able to rattle them off in chat channels with military precision. They’re expected to bring their best gear — armour and guns — and then they’re expected to never miss a headshot. 
 
For this endeavour, Destiny 2 offers two rewards: one intangible and one tangible. The former is an intoxicating sense of satisfaction at beating such a sustained mechanical challenge with a fire-forged group of new friends. The latter is some new guns and armour of slightly higher quality with which they can do it all again.They show Destiny 2 game at both its best — as a frequently beautiful and consistently enjoyable shooter — and its worst, as a grinding loot box that ends up paying out in frustratingly small increments.The shooting comes first, and Destiny 2’s guns feel uniformly fantastic. There’s a huge number of them, and while they fall into specific archetypes, there’s variation within those templates. Scout rifles — scoped and single-shot weapons by definition — are my favourite for story missions and aimless patrols, but I prefer to break out my Vigilance Wing pulse rifle for Destiny 2’s PvP activities. 
 
Vigilance Wing is a grand and gold-plated thing, bedecked in Egyptian symbols and finished off with two sweeping wings on its sides. Where most pulse rifles fire three-bullet bursts, this kid shoots five, making kills in Destiny 2’s multiplayer Crucible a doddle — assuming I can aim my first two bursts above the neck.I have the same affection for the MIDA Multi-Tool, an understated and functional-looking scout rifle that shoots with a pleasant clicking sound. Same goes for the Wardcliff Coil, which looks like the head of a jury-rigged microphone and shoots a hailstorm of weird blue bolts in the vicinity of its target. Or Merciless: a boss-melting fusion rifle that gets angrier if it doesn’t kill its target, charging faster with every repeat shot.These guns are just some of Destiny 2’s Exotics: specialised and memorable weapons earned either through convoluted quest chains, or randomly awarded as drops. But even its standard guns feel like they’ve had similar amounts of care lavished on their kick, their bark, their reload animations, and their whole feel. 
 
They have lost something from their console transition — specifically, an over-eager auto-aim that made controller shooting surprisingly easy. On PC, with the precision of mouse and keyboard, auto-aim is disabled, meaning your reticule placement is entirely on you. This is a sensible shift, and one that needed to be made in order to keep Destiny 2’s competitive multiplayer modes feeling fair.Auto-aim’s not gone entirely: Bungie says that it’s kept it in the game for controller users, a decision that’s already controversial. It would be tough to give up mouse control, though, which feels smooth and precise — there’s none of the unpredictable acceleration that some console transitions end up lumbered with. By tying shooting to mouse clicks rather than chunkier trigger pulls, Destiny 2’s PC shooting feels a touch flimsier than its console cousin, but not by much: bullets have a distinct visual heft, connecting with enemy torsos, arms, and legs with obvious thunks.Those enemies come from various species, and include the scuttling Fallen, the chitinous Hive, and the weird, shimmering Taken. You’ll also face the Cabal — genocidal space turtles who want to capture the weird power that makes Destiny 2’s player characters immortal. These waddling monsters are fat, grumpy, and my favourite things to shoot, especially when you hit them in the head — at which point their helmets fly off with a ping, a cloud of previously pressurised gas, and an accompanying curse in an angry alien language. 
 
On console and controller, a lot of the heavy lifting in making the weapons feel good is done via rumble and force feedback. On PC and mouse, however, it’s clear that so much of Destiny 2’s great gunfeel actually comes from that sound design: a suite of booms, bangs, and bursts that keeps shooting fun. It’s hugely important that shooting remains fun, too: the MMO-ish structure of the game means you’ll be pootling around its public areas and be replaying its strikes, raids, and patrol missions and again and again.There are a set of core story missions, too, that cast the player as a Guardian from Earth, stripped of their Light (the power that makes them able to resurrect on death) by king of the angry space turtles, Dominus Ghaul. In order to reclaim that Light, you’ll hop from Earth to the moons of Io and Titan, as well as the imaginary minor planet Nessus, brought back to our solar system by robotic hive mind species the Vex.Even for the creators of the Halo series, Destiny lore is dense, but Destiny 2 is wildly more comprehensible than its predecessor. Destiny 1 never came to PC, but genuinely included the line “I don’t have time to explain why I don’t have time to explain.” (For extra points, that line was provided by a character whose mission, allegiance, and even name is still unknown.) For ease of understanding, Destiny 2 leans far harder on a few core characters, established already in the pre-existing fiction and given clear personalities by the very earliest cut-scenes. There’s the mystical Ikora Rey, the stoic Commander Zavala, and the cheeky Cayde-6, each voiced by mid-tier celebrities (Gina Torres, Lance Reddick, and Nathan Fillion respectively). 
 
They popped up in a six-hour campaign that reached an impressive crescendo after first laying my character low, and then letting me bring her back to power. Missions aren’t structured in particularly thrilling ways — it’s a shooting gallery all the way to infrequent bosses — but they’re set against some of gaming’s juiciest vistas. It’s a beautiful game, especially on a powerful PC, where its huge stages run smoothly. Titan, in particular, is incredible, with a greeny blue terraformed ocean that bats cargo ships around like toys and makes me feel like a tiny speck of insignificance in an uncaring solar system.That’s the same even on underpowered PCs, where “low” quality settings still produce pretty views at high frames-per-second. Destiny 2’s also picked up a grab bag of graphical options — including Vsync and an FOV slider that goes all the way to 105 — that the console kids didn’t get. It all contributes to some spectacular moments, especially when, mid-mission, Destiny 2 decides to ramp up the spectacle.Its missions are coherent, well-paced, and given the views, clearly expensive. But that makes it all the weirder that Destiny 2 is happy to jettison its story missions as soon as you’ve played them once. Repetition is the name of the game with three-player strike missions, patrol quests, and the Leviathan raid, which asks players to come back every week to get the best endgame gear. In order to do the story missions again, however, you’ll need to visit Ikora Rey to pick up one of a limited pool of “memories,” or start a new character entirely. 
 
I think it’s so willing to drop these story missions because although it dresses up in the clothes of a first-person shooter, Destiny 2 is something else. I’ve been calling it “MMO-ish” so far, but that’s inaccurate. It’s first-person, and there is shooting, sure, but it’s not “MMO-ish” — it’s just an MMO. It’s got daily challenges, it’s got social spaces shared between players, and it’s even got little numbers that pop out of enemies when you damage them. Most importantly, it has buckets of loot, and it has a levelling system designed to keep players grinding away for incremental increases to their strength.Actually, it has two levelling systems. Destiny 2’s character level system is simple: a straight shot from level one to level 20 that most players will max out by playing through the story missions on offer. Its other system is far more involved, is tied to players’ gear, and is the reason I set my alarm for 4AM to finish the Leviathan raid with internet randos.A player’s weapons, armour, and accoutrements are all assigned their own level, from 10 to 305 (at present). These numbers are then averaged out and assigned to the player as their own “light level.” That light level defines a player’s ability to take on late-game tasks like the Leviathan raid, which in turn pay out with even higher-tier loot to push that level further.The system means that a player with a full suite of 305 armour and guns will hit the level cap, but — for the first few months at least — you’ll likely be sitting somewhere between 280 and 300. I’m stuck in this limbo right now, my level dragged up by a fancy pulse rifle I got when my clanmates finished a weekly event, but pulled back down by a terribly uncool helmet. 
 
It’s far less binary than a more standard character experience system, stratifying Destiny 2’s endgame as a very slow getting-ready-for-a-night-out montage: I need the perfect hat, the perfect trousers, the perfect cape. An infusion system also means you can continue to imbue your favourite pair of space leggings with your more powerful gear, or, as in my case, continue to wear the chest armour with the fluffiest collar all the way into the next year.But the system can also be grindingly annoying when it doesn’t spit out the things you need. Especially when you dedicate five hours at 4AM to complete the punishing Leviathan raid and your reward is the same pair of gloves you got last time — albeit at a slightly lower level.Other missions, including the three-player strikes and the daily challenges, don’t give out loot directly. Instead they use a token system, handing the player chits that can be traded in with fully voiced vendors in the game’s social spaces and on each of its planets. Hand over enough of these tokens and you’re guaranteed regular loot (generally at a lower level than your current), but despite working to democratise the obtaining of new weapons and armour, the system is weirdly dissatisfying.It’s disappointing, because Destiny 2’s token system sounds like it should be an upgrade over Destiny 1’s more random loot drops. It ensures that players aren’t grinding for days only to get nothing, keeps a constant stream of new items coming in, and makes an easy way to measure progress from game start to endgame. Still though, I don’t like it. Few games have laid my basic meatbrain stupidity out as clearly as Destiny 2, but I can’t help it: I just don’t get the same dopamine spikes when I pull something new out of the big invisible loot pile as I do in other games. 
 
That’s also because it’s so much easier to just get all of the stuff I want in Destiny 2 than it was in Destiny 1. That problem isn’t helped by the game’s weapon perk system, which locks specific bonuses to specific types of gun. A “Does Not Compute” scout rifle, for example, will always come with the same three sights, the same boosts to movement speed while aiming, and the same choice between bonuses to aim stability or a magazine increase. This reduces the excitement of pulling new loot, as once you’ve got one Does Not Compute, getting a second becomes pointless.Half the guns you most likely won’t even want. Despite Destiny 2’s huge arsenal, a handful of guns have risen to the top as the only acceptable weapons to use in both PvE and PvP environments. The previous game’s system — in which perks were randomly generated and players were praying for a gun’s “god roll” — could involve far more grind, but also allowed for far greater difference between play styles.Similar edges were sanded off Destiny 1’s PvP Crucible mode, to its arguable detriment. Where the previous game had a six-on-six format, Destiny 2 casts teams of four against each other, and rotates game modes at random. The result is a slower game that — on console at least — has calcified already, all but demanding that players roam the map in tight groups, picking off opponents that have wandered from the herd with one of four or five communally sanctioned weapons.On PC there’s a chance that metagame could wander into more interesting territory, but in these early days, I’m more inclined to believe it’ll continue in the same vein. Laser accurate scout rifles are currently the top of the pile of guns, and the increased aiming ability offered by the mouse is likely to keep them there. More of a shift could be caused by Bungie themselves, who have been willing in the past to step in and make tweaks to both individual guns and weapon categories wholesale, but they’ve not always been quick to do so. 
 
I know Bungie can be slow to make these changes because Destiny 1 took over my life for a time. I spent that year playing and replaying the same missions, hoping for the perfect weapon drop, and hanging on the company’s every tweet for months at a time. In its current state, I’ll be done with Destiny 2 much sooner, having already picked up the majority of its goodies and blasted through most of its endgame.Until then, though, I’ve got an alarm set for 4AM next Wednesday morning. And the Wednesday morning after that, and probably the Wednesday morning after that. And if a slick, beautiful shooter is keeping you up at night for a month, isn’t that sometimes enough?Note: This Destiny 2 review has been written after spending several hours on the PC version of the game, and more than 50 hours with its console counterpart. While graphical settings, menus, and control schemes are different from PC to console — and have been explored specifically in this writeup — the story, missions, and activities on offer remain the same.Once we’ve had more time to try the game on varying machines of varying quality, we’ll also follow-up with another piece that speaks to the PC-specific tech experience. Destiny 2 will also change in the future as Bungie makes tweaks and releases new DLC. Expect RPS to update our collective opinions accordingly at that time.Destiny 2 is out now for Windows and is available via battle.net and other retailers for £44.99.You're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!

Please try again Returning players know that Destiny‘s best loot and gear was only to be found by completing challenging events with no matchmaking, primarily Nightfall strikes and raids. That meant you’d need to organize and schedule a team of three to six people you knew to be available to take on hours-long sessions – a tall ask for many grown-up gamers with busy lives.Bungie’s reasons for not supporting matchmaking made sense, to a point. It worried strangers wouldn’t communicate and strategize with one another, grow frustrated, and potentially drop out before completing the mission, making it all but impossible for the others to finish. But proving Bungie wrong, it would seem, were third-party workarounds in the form of websites that helped players who couldn’t put together a fireteam on their own to find each other. It was matchmaking outside the game, as it were. And it worked. Grouped together, plenty of committed loners successfully completed Nightfall strikes and raids.  Bungie has tried to address this problem in Destiny 2 in a clever way. A new feature – currently in beta – called Guided Games allows lone players to be matched with clans short a squad member. It’s a very specific kind of matchmaking that ensures everyone involved knows what they’re getting into. The loners need to take an “oath” to commit to spending the time required to complete the mission, to cooperate with others, to communicate, and to be open to various strategies, while the hosting clan members understand that they’ll be working with someone with whom they may need to be patient and show them the ropes.That said, it’s not perfect. For starters, if you’re the loner and you somehow lose your connection to Destiny’s servers while playing (this happened once to me), you’ll be dubbed an “oath breaker” and get banned from Guided Games for a while through no fault of your own.And while I understand the usefulness of Guided Games for raids, which are extraordinarily intricate and abstruse, requiring serious teamwork, I’m still not convinced that they’re needed in Nightfall strikes. I completed Destiny 2‘s first Nightfall strike with a pair of players who spoke no English without any more trouble than the regular Vanguard strikes, which support matchmaking.On the subject of raids, Destiny 2‘s first one – Leviathan – is a doozy. A reader who belongs to a clan of dedicated Destiny players offered up his team to guide me through, and I relied on them entirely to show me the ropes. We needed to act as a team to run gauntlets, creep through alien forests undetected, and navigate a massive mechanical labyrinth. It would have been difficult in the extreme to manage these tasks with strangers who hadn’t learned to cooperate with one another. That said, I still kind of wish Bungie would at least allow us to try. Because speaking as someone who keeps gaming hours that don’t jive with those of his friends, I’ve experienced far more frustration simply trying to get a group together to try a raid than I have playing and repeatedly failing a tough encounter.Moving beyond raids and Nightfall strikes, I’ve extraordinary little to complain about endgame content. There’s so much more in Destiny 2 at initial release that it makes the original game’s launch offerings seem almost like a demo by comparison. I’m inching toward the 300 Power level cap (I was at 273 at the time of this writing) and I have yet to do any missions twice, save for a handful of Vanguard strikes. There seems to be an almost infinite array of little tasks, quests, adventures, and patrols available, and many of them – like the Invitation from the Emperor adventure on Nessus – add meaningfully to Destiny’s larger lore, providing more context for what we already know or preparing us for what’s to come.And the Crucible, while a bit low on maps and modes at the moment, offers some of the tightest and most entertaining player-versus-player combat around. Teams are smaller – just four-versus-four rather than six-versus-six – as are most of the maps. And with more match types revolving around objectives – such as Countdown, in which players must either defend or defuse bombs – there’s clearly more of a focus on teamwork. Even in more traditional match types I’ve noticed that groups of players tend to stick together, regardless of whether they’re part of a clan. Plus, subtle changes to various systems – the super meter takes longer to charge, heavy ammo can only be picked up by one player when it spawns – ensures there’s a lot less chaos and fewer one-hit kills. It’s more tactical than Destiny‘s Crucible, and it’s better for it.But it’s the progression system that’s the heart of the endgame experience, and I’m happy to say that it, too, is an improvement over what we saw in the original. There are still several types of currencies and various ways to earn better gear, but the Byzantine complexity of it all has been drastically scaled back. Save for a few ongoing weapon quests – one of which has taken the form of a riddle I’ve yet to solve – I’ve always felt like I’ve known more or less what I needed to do and how to go about doing it. It’s easier to upgrade exotic weapons so that they stay with you as your Power level grows, and there’s far less grind-y hunting for random resources to achieve arbitrary objectives.Most importantly, though, I’ve yet to experience the sensation of feeling like I’m not moving forward. If I head out for an hour or so to fight in the Crucible, do a strike or two, or complete a few more adventures on a moon or planetoid, I can count on advancing at least one or two Power levels when I get back to the social hub to trade in my loot and decipher engrams. I’m always making progress. That might change once I hit the level cap, but right now the sense of forward momentum is so tangible that I’m finding it hard to put down my controller at the end of the night.The improved endgame combined with a far more satisfying campaign makes Destiny 2 an easy recommendation for folks interested in an online shooter. If Bungie can sustain the feeling of progression through the long months between expansions – and perhaps do just a little more to make the experience a bit more welcoming for lone players – then I suspect Destiny 2 will enjoy a long life.   Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion and encourage all readers to share their views on our articles.

Destiny 2,Noah Anzaldua,GamingTrend,https://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/destiny-2-bungie-30th-anniversary-pack-review-a-marathon-of-bungies-best/,"Destiny 2’s latest content drop is a special one. Rather than being tied to a specific narrative beat, or a progression of the story, The Bungie 30th Anniversary Event is about meditating on the players’ journey with Bungie so far. With nods to just about all of Bungie’s created IP (with the possible exception of Oni), this event does come across as a celebration of Bungie’s best and brightest. For consumers looking to get in on the action, however, there may be some initial confusion as to what is free-to-play and what requires the purchase of the 30th Anniversary Pack. Here is a handy graphic straight from Bungie that makes everything crystal clear.Now that that’s cleared up, let’s get into reviewing the main offerings. On the free side of things, everyone has access to the new six-player activity, Dares of Eternity. Players might hear that name and think, “that sounds like a cheesy game show” and those players would be exactly right. Dares of Eternity plays into that game show theme all throughout its run. Xur, everyone’s favorite emissary of the nine, has somehow gotten mixed up with an otherworldly horse, known only as Starhorse, and now he is acting as our own personal game show host. Needless to say, Xur’s will has never been his own, and now his life goal seems to be helping Starhorse in its quest to get the player some loot. Xur taking the spotlight seems weird at first. He has always been the shady figure akin to the merchant in Resident Evil 4, but this event gives players a little more insight into him as a character and some of it is pretty moving, especially when it comes to the way Bungie writes him during the questline. For the most part, though, he is just an unexpectedly funny “announcer” during the new activity. After each encounter, you are rewarded with neighing from Starhorse and slot machine sound effects that only further the wacky game show feeling.Dares of Eternity takes place in the Realm of the Nine, with its white towering architecture accented by deep pink and purple lighting. The aesthetic of the Nine has always been top-notch, and the visual design does not disappoint here. Each new area in the activity is kicked off with a spin of a wheel to determine the next enemy race you will fight, and Xur always has some witty remark or callback to offer about the final outcome. If it’s Cabal, watch out for a fun reminder of the most iconic line in Destiny history, and if it’s Hive, he might remind you to bring a Sword. It is all really funny and well done, in a way that won’t get old any time soon. Each fight is excellently crafted, offering more engagement and objectives to the players than most six-man matchmade activities that Bungie throws the players’ way. Players will either be capturing points, collecting buffs to destroy crystals, throwing orbs at blights, and much more, and the mode is sure to stay fresh thanks to the randomness that the wheel creates.Additionally, while Guardians take on these encounters, Bungie has curated the best music from Destiny to accompany each fight. Themes associated with each enemy race dominate the score and create an amazing sense of nostalgia that heightens an already great activity. Even without the nostalgia, though, the music from the original Destiny has always been exceptional, and it is used here to great effect. The final bosses of Dares of Eternity are all taken from the repertoire of enemies the Guardians have dispatched in the past. This includes Zydron, Crota, and Valus Ta’aurc, and every fight incorporates the most memorable aspects of their past renditions. Overall, Dares of Eternity is a fantastic new six-man activity, free for all players to take part in. It rivals the fun of Menagerie, arguably Bungie’s best six-man activity, and it does so by creating its own atmosphere and mood that feels like a celebration of the power fantasy Bungie has created with Destiny.Destiny, however, would be nothing without its rewards, and Dares of Eternity does not disappoint. After completing the first run of Dares, players are met with the rewards they can start chasing. In what would be the craziest move of brand synergy (if Fortnite did not pull things like this off every day), the Halo Battle Rifle, the Combat Evolved Magnum, the Halo Beam Rifle  and the Halo Energy Sword are now present in Destiny 2. All of them are available under different names, of course, but they are translations of Halo weapons into Destiny’s sandbox. The battle rifle and magnum stand out the most as they really feel exactly like Halo weapons. In fact, I would say that the Destiny 2 battle rifle feels better than that of Halo Infinite. Guns in Destiny 2 and their effects on enemies are just too good to be compared to most other shooters, and seeing a Cabal head pop off as I hip-fire BR bursts into it just gives me a much better sense of kinetic feedback than doing the same to any enemy in Halo ever has. The magnum, known in Destiny 2 as the Forerunner, is extremely unique. It is a sidearm, it uses special ammo, it is in the kinetic slot, and it is an Exotic that deals significantly more precision damage when the enemy is unshielded. It is in Destiny 2 in all its glory, down to the insanely oversized reticle and the crisp feeling zoom. No matter how viable it is in the endgame, I can see myself using the BR and Forerunner combo in the months to come pretty much all the time. Everything I have discussed so far is completely free, with the addition of a breech-loaded grenade launcher called Pardon Our Dust, and it is all completely worth trying out, even if you aren’t necessarily a fan of Destiny. Now, though, let’s move on to the 30th Anniversary Pack.On top of the new weapons, comes a host of new perks that will most likely roll on future weapons to come. Some of these perks are really unique, offering new ways to play and change up builds. One such perk, Perpetual Motion, buffs reload speed and other stats while in motion. Another, Eager Edge, increases the lunge distance and speed of swords immediately after switching to them. There are a few other added perks here that I won’t spoil, but every one of them adds something interesting to the gameplay.The pack includes a lot of cosmetics, which may or may not be worth it to consumers, but the main offering is the new Dungeon, its rewards, and the Gjallarhorn Exotic Rocket Launcher. The Dungeon, Grasp of Avarice, takes place in the Destiny loot cave from the original game. It is a really special thing when players are able to influence the design of a huge game like Destiny, and that is exactly what they have done here. The loot cave was such a moment for not just Destiny players, but the video game world in general, and now Bungie has honored its legacy by creating an incredible tribute to the “greed” of Guardians. The story, told through collectible audio logs, explores just how far some Guardians went on their quest for engrams, and it gets surprisingly dark.A friend and I two-manned the Dungeon and went in without looking into any guides or videos. I fully recommend buying the pack to people who want to grind new Destiny content and need something to hold them over until The Witch Queen. The dungeon itself is extremely well-designed, with a ton of secrets and beautiful spaces to play in. It honestly surprised me how much they included in the Dungeon, and there was one encounter, in particular, that is reminiscent of the sparrow race in Scourge of the Past. That said, nothing in the dungeon is incredibly innovative. There is nothing that feels like a pushing of the envelope for what Bungie can do, but it is all perfectly designed and polished, and a lot of fun to go through. The rewards for completing the Dungeon include weapons such as the Eyasluna and the 1000 Yard Stare, as well as a set of armor based on the aesthetic of the Thorn hand cannon. Completing the Dungeon is also the key part of progressing the quest for the Gjallarhorn. Grasp of Avarice is fun, and I will definitely be grinding it many times a week to farm god-rolled weapons and armor, as I am sure many other Guardians will as well.The Gjallarhorn is back, and although I never used it in Destiny, I am loving every bit of it in Destiny 2. It is intricately designed, with gold details and a regal feel to it, and every shot of it feels like bliss. Not only that, it buffs non-Exotic rocket launchers held by your teammates, essentially making them mini-Gjallarhorns, and affording them another Exotic slot. It feels amazing to use, but it also does not feel like a must-use. This is generally the direction Bungie is going in with weapon balance in general, and that’s a good thing for the game. Not having must-use weapons creates build diversity and allows for more player expression, which is really the driving reason to play once you hit the endgame. Still, once players unlock the Gjallarhorn catalyst, they may not want to put the gun down as it makes it one of the few rocket launchers capable of holding 2 rockets in a mag and buffs the already strong Wolfpack Rounds.For many, the $24.99 asking price for Gjallarhorn, a Dungeon with some nice rewards, and some cosmetics might not be worth it, but I think Bungie has created one of their best content drops yet with this release.Bungie’s 30th Anniversary Celebration feels like Christmas Day for Bungie fans. Every second spent playing the new activities and using the battle rifle and magnum feels like a dream that doesn’t have to end. A lot of the offerings here are free, but the Dungeon and the Gjallarhorn are totally worth the asking price even without the extra cosmetic goodies. This drop is not only a celebration of Bungie’s past, but a glimpse into Destiny 2’s bright future, and I am all in.—Noah AnzalduaSee below for our list of partners and affiliates:One of the longest running independent gaming news, reviews and culture sites on the web.The thing that is magical about the Wizarding World isn’t the magic – it’s...by Ron BurkeThe world is going to end.

Destiny 2,Travis Northup,GamingTrend,http://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/destiny-2-review/,"With a more focused narrative, more activities to do than ever before, and enormous quality of life improvements to the Destiny sandbox and economy, there isn’t much to dislike about this game.Some video games blow you away with beautiful, open-world areas, while others hold your attention with intense, fast-paced gameplay. Some games draw you in with a social experience that you can enjoy with your friends, while others focus on telling a captivating story. There aren’t many games, however, that do all of these things. Destiny 2 is one of them. Gripping, addictive, and a downright massive game, Bungie’s follow-up to Destiny is bigger and better than I could have hoped for and playing it so far has been an unconditional joy.Destiny 2 begins with the metaphorical and literal destruction of everything we came to know in Destiny 1. The Tower, longtime home to the Guardians and well-known social space from the original Destiny, is overrun by a hostile force. Your powers are taken from you by military Cabal Emperor and albino grunt from Halo lookalike Dominus Ghaul. Stripped of your power, you are cast out of the Last City, and left with nothing. Throughout the course of Destiny 2’s campaign, you’ll reclaim your lost abilities and fight back against the Cabal Empire.The plot of Destiny 2 is simple. It’s a revenge quest against an overwhelming force in a larger-than-life science fiction Universe — in other words, not something that gamers are unaccustomed to. That said, Destiny 2 pulls from a vast amount of lore and world-building done over the course of three years in Destiny 1, and puts it to good use. By expertly utilizing the foundation set up by Destiny 1, the sequel manages to tell a heroic story of epic scale, while also taking time to slow things down and savor emotional moments. In Destiny 2, not only do we get epic moments culminating in a massive, beautiful explosion, but we also get little moments that are equally enjoyable. We learn about the villain’s history and insecurities. We see a commander brought low. We see the Throughout the course of Destiny 2’s campaign, you’ll reclaim your lost abilities and fight back against the Cabal Empire. brutality of being invaded by a hostile force. Without going into any spoilers, I’ll say that the second story mission in Destiny 2’s campaign in particular differs starkly from anything that Bungie has ever done, and stirred emotion in me in a way I never expected a normally light-hearted game like Destiny to do. Balancing the over-the-top action that fans have come to expect from Destiny with these little moments is no easy task, but Bungie does it masterfully with Destiny 2, and those who found the narrative in Destiny thus far wanting will be pleasantly surprised by the sequel.New characters to Destiny, like Dominus Ghaul and Iago, get a surprising amount of time in the spotlight as the game’s villains, while existing characters like Ikora, Cayde-6, and Zavala all undergo their personal story arcs as some of the game’s most dominant personalities. While Bungie created compelling characters with The Taken King and Rise of Iron, Destiny 2 takes it to a new level by having these personalities undergo a massive crisis, and showing them to us out of their element. On the other hand, while we’ve become accustomed to seeing Destiny’s villains portrayed as heartless monsters looking to wipe humanity off the map, Destiny 2 does a lot to humanize its chief antagonist, and presents us with motives that are more complex than wanton destruction. That said, some characters stubbornly remain little more than comic relief, a fact I would be more disappointed with if the comedy weren’t so damned good.Although there are many things to like about Destiny 2’s surprisingly interesting narrative and complex characters, the story wraps up so quickly, it’ll give you whiplash, and leaves many questions annoyingly unanswered. Worst of all, some of the characters they spend valuable storytelling time building up throughout the campaign, depart in a manner unfitting of their potential. I don’t think I’ll be spoiling anything or surprising anyone by stating that the good guys win in Destiny 2’s story, which results in some of the very characters I’ve described to exit the narrative prematurely. I think this is a serious problem for the Destiny franchise. Everyone wants to see the bad guy get his comeuppance. I get it. But Destiny has a real problem in that it has no longterm antagonist, and if the cutscene before the credits roll is any indication, Destiny will continue to have this problem. We’re introduced to bad guys like we’re speed dating, and after our five minutes is up, we never see any of them again. We had the darkness in vanilla Destiny who are almost entirely absent from Destiny 2, followed by a slew of lesser villains that last no more than a few hours before being slain. With Ghaul, we had a real opportunity to meet a force that we couldn’t immediately take down — a longterm villain to provide players with someone to know intimately over time and elevate the narrative to something more than it’s been. I hope that someday we’ll get that in Destiny, but we didn’t get it here.Perhaps the biggest change that Destiny 2 introduces comes in the form of how you spend your time playing. Whereas Destiny 1’s core gameplay mechanic revolved around replaying the same set of activities again and again to grind for rewards, Destiny 2 provides a wide variety of unique activities with a regular flow of rewards, in a system that a Bungie employee described to me as being “more compatible with life.” Instead of a set of activities on the destinations map, players now drop down to a planet and open up their map to find things to do. Players can do story missions, strikes, and crucible, of course, but they can also do “adventures,” a new type of side-quest that tells a story, “lost sectors,” an activity that asks you to discover and explore a hidden area of the world to claim a prize at the end, and “treasure hunts,” which have you hunting for a golden chest filled with loot, hidden in the world. In addition, public events and patrols make a return, with various quality of life improvements. For example, public events can now become heroic public events, when a secret objective is completed during a normal public event. Heroic public events are usually difficult to trigger and harder to overcome, but provide excellent rewards upon completion. Doing any of these activities gives you tokens that can be put towards leveling up with an NPC, which provides loot drops that are guaranteed to make your guardian stronger.And all of this is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of content. Each map is absolutely packed with places to go, things to do, and enemies to slay. Various activities can also be replayed with new dialogue and other changes to renew the experience, and special rewards are granted by doing so. And this is all before PvP, the raid, or any endgame activity is taken into account — the sheer volume of content is jarring. Destiny 2 delivers a world of things to do in a way that Destiny 1 promised, but never quite created. And best of all, Destiny 2 delivers all of this content at a breakneck pace with few wasted moments. Where Destiny 1 had you floating in orbit a lot, Destiny 2 allows you to jump from planet-to-planet without floating around in dark space. Where Destiny 1 had you searching for a group to play with on a “looking for group” website, Destiny 2 provides Guided Games, a service that pairs solo players with existing groups, and encourages everyone to get in on all of the action that the game has to offer.Once players clear out the campaign though, they reach Destiny’s endgame loop, which has much less to offer in the way of content. You’ll clear the Nightfall and the Raid. You can participate in Trials when it goes live, and work on the weekly activities that come out on reset, but most of the time you’ll be grinding. You’ll do 100 public events, run the same strikes until you are talking along with the dialogue, and play crucible until your thumbs bleed, all in the name of getting a little stronger or getting a new exotic to drop. This is the part of Destiny that can become a bit of a pain to endure, but the good news is that this time around it seems totally optional. Hardcore players can grind all they like, but there aren’t any events so far in Destiny 2 that require you to play ad nauseam unlike Destiny 1. This is a huge improvement for those who want to be included in endgame content without going through the slog of an endgame grind, but a disappointment for those looking for an excuse to log on each and every day. As one of the latter players, I wish that there was more content geared towards those spending a lot of time in the endgame loop.If there is one thing that Destiny has always nailed as a franchise, it’s the engrossing gameplay the series offers, and Destiny 2 continues that tradition. Combat in Destiny 2 is fast-paced, over-the-top, and awesome in a way that few games are able to achieve. Throughout my time with Destiny 2, I found myself hooting, hollering, cursing, cheering, gasping, laughing, and much more. It’s a game that simply invites you to react to it. One moment you find yourself exploring a mysterious cave, the next you’re surrounded by hordes of dangerous enemies, and a few moments later you’re standing atop a pile of their corpses holding a magical sword covered in flame. It’s every bit as fun as it sounds, and on its own is worth the price of admission, in a game that offers so much more.
Players are no longer expected to level up their equipment (usually through pouring motes of light into them) to unlock all the perks, and instead of relying on random rolls, all unique equipment has predetermined stats designed for the balance and experience that was intended for the player.The Crucible, Destiny’s PvP content, also returns in Destiny 2, and is better than ever. While Destiny 1 could be a bit chaotic and wild with its 6v6 modes, and one-hit-kill grenades and super abilities, Destiny 2 has tuned the pacing down a bit. Competitive modes are now always 4v4, and time-to-kill has been increased thanks to guardian abilities being nerfed a bit. These adjustments create a PvP experience that is a little more strategic. Instead of rushing in, and hoping to get a few abilities kills before getting stuck with a grenade, you’re encouraged to stick with your team, and use concentrated fire and communication to best the opposing team. As a Destiny player who values a less chaotic PvP experience, and who always has a reliable fireteam at his back, I couldn’t be more excited for the changes to the Destiny PvP meta. For solo players however, this focus on teamwork might be a drawback. Destiny 1 could be a frustrating experience when you found yourself paired with crappy teammates, and I don’t think the situation will be improved in Destiny 1. Hopefully Bungie’s focus on clans and guided games, will aid solo players in enjoying crucible, and other group activities.There have been a ton of mechanical quality of life changes to Destiny 2 that warrant analyzing for this review, but I’ll try to do so without getting too lost in the weeds (which is easy to do in a game the size of Destiny 2). First up are the loadout changes. The loadout menu may feel very familiar to fans of Destiny 1, but a lot has been reimagined. The primary, special, and heavy weapon slots have been replaced by kinetic, energy, and power weapon slots. The primary effect this has is that weapons like the sniper rifle, the shotgun, and the fusion rifle have been moved to the power weapon slot, which makes them less prominent in the game, especially when it comes to PvP where power ammo is harder to come by. As for the kinetic and energy weapon slots, they both serve as primary weapon slots with distinctly different uses, advantages, and disadvantages. Kinetic weapons tend to do more damage against unshielded enemies and do not possess elemental effects, making them a reliable choice for most of the combat in Destiny. Energy weapons, on the other hand, do less damage to unshielded enemies, but possess elemental properties, and, when used against enemies with shield of that same element, do much more damage and culminate in a massive explosion when an enemy shield is downed.Meanwhile, power weapons serve as the most powerful option afforded to the player, but whose ammo is harder to come by. That said, in many PvE activities, power ammo is common enough to use almost as your primary weapon of choice, so their role is actually more prominent in Destiny 2 than it was in Destiny 1. My initial analysis of this new loadout system is that it’s far superior to the system Destiny 1 had in place. In competitive modes, kinetic and energy weapons are your bread and butter, with power ammo mixing up gameplay and becoming a major point of contention on the battlefield. This makes the game less about finding ways to one-shot your opponents with snipers and shotguns, and more about working together to achieve victory through concentrated fire. In PvE, power ammo is common enough to not diminish the importance of fan favorites like the sniper rifle, while also creating an interesting relationship between kinetic and energy weapons and when it’s best to use them.Another major loadout change comes in the form of the way weapons and armor work. Players are no longer expected to level up their equipment (usually through pouring motes of light into them) to unlock all the perks, and instead of relying on random rolls, all unique equipment has predetermined stats designed for the balance and experience that was intended for the player. Both of these are positive changes, as you’re no longer wasting valuable time grinding to get Destiny looks better than it ever has, and exploring vast expanses as your guardian is often a breathtaking experience.equipment leveled, or trying to get the perfect roll for a weapon you like. Subclasses have also been simplified, by offering pre-selected sets of subclass perks that you equip as a group. This change I am less a fan of, as customizing your subclass in Destiny 1 was one of the more rewarding experiences. That said, the new way is simpler in a way that a lot of people will appreciate, and provides a group of perks that work together in a comprehensive way automatically, instead of asking players to “do the math,” and figure out what works.Talking about the economy in Destiny is always difficult. It’s complicated and not terribly interesting, but it’s also something that every player cares deeply about. I will do my best to break it all down without boring anyone to tears. Destiny 2 has three currencies: glimmer, legendary shards, and bright dust. Glimmer is used to buy things, and serves as the primary currency for players in most cases. Glimmer is used to purchase new equipment from vendors, equip new shaders and skins to items, and much more. Glimmer also caps out at 100,000, which is a nice boost from the cap of 25,000 in Destiny 1. Legendary shards are used to infuse weaker equipment into stronger equipment. Shards are obtained by dismantling legendary and exotic weapons and armor that the player no longer needs, and the cost of infusing an item depends on its rarity, and the rarity of the item being used for infusion(e.g. infusing an exotic, using a rare item costs more legendary shards). The final currency is bright dust/silver, which is used to purchase items from Eververse, and obtained by dismantling items acquired through the Eververse store.Microtransactions are featured prominently in Destiny 2, which is not a thing that most players will be happy to hear. The good news is that the microtransaction economy has been greatly improved, and players now have more opportunities to earn Eververse items without emptying their wallet. Once the player reaches the max level with a character, every additional level up grants the player a “bright engram,” which contains a package of Eververse items. This means that by playing Destiny, you’ll gain bright dust and other items that you’d normally have to obtain via a microtransaction, which is awesome. That said, there is some time-gating here. Every week, the first three level-ups towards a bright engram happen more quickly than all of the levels following. This means that earning that fourth, fifth, and sixth bright engram will require a significantly longer time investment, essentially time-gating you from getting all of that glorious premium loot that you’ll undoubtedly crave. It’s not my favorite system in the world, but it’s head-and-shoulders above the system in place in Destiny 1, which essentially required a monetary investment if you ever hoped to obtain Eververse items. Absent from Destiny 2’s economy are motes of light, strange coins, exotic shards, and various other currencies that doubtless confused many Destiny players over the years. Instead, Bungie has retooled their economy and made these three currencies manage all of the things you do while playing — a huge improvement in my book.Destiny 2’s presentation is better than any game in recent memory. Running in 4K/30 fps on PS4 Pro, Destiny looks better than it ever has, and exploring vast expanses as your guardian is often a breathtaking experience. You’ll climb massive trees with cherry blossoms, dive into the depths of a sleek facility overrun with hive forces, and crawl through the mud of a ruined city. Guns are sleek and unique, and the armor you find makes you feel increasingly like a badass. But despite how good the game looks and runs, it’s eclipsed by the absolutely incredible audio presentation. The music in Destiny 2 is varied, emotional when it needs to be, and pulse-quickening more often than not. Each weapon has a unique rhythm to it, enemies scream and roar, and loot pops onscreen with the addictive, satisfying sound imaginable. Destiny 2 easily has one of the best presentations in recent gaming memory.Finally, having played through the raid, I can confirm that hardcore players will be able to look forward to incredibly challenging content in Destiny 2. The puzzles are intricate, the encounters are challenging, and the ambiance and mood are spectacular. Although one encounter in particular made me want to throw a controller at the television at times, the overall experience is equal parts amazing and frustrating, and that’s always been a part of the raid experience in any game. One marked improvement to the raid experience is the inclusion of cutscenes and dialogue in the raid. Though this time around Bungie seems to be dipping their toes in the water, I hope that in the future they’ll expand on this idea and tell a full narrative as a part of their endgame content. It would make the traumatically difficult encounters all the more worth the while to overcome.Destiny 2 is a massive accomplishment, and a huge step in the right direction for the franchise. With a more focused narrative, more activities to do than ever before, and enormous quality of life improvements to the Destiny sandbox and economy, there isn't much to dislike about Destiny 2. —Travis NorthupSee below for our list of partners and affiliates:One of the longest running independent gaming news, reviews and culture sites on the web.The thing that is magical about the Wizarding World isn’t the magic – it’s...by Ron BurkeThe world is going to end.

Destiny 2,Matt Brown,Windows Central,http://www.windowscentral.com/destiny-2-xbox-one-review,"No offers foundWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.Despite mixed opinions on the game at launch, it can't be argued that the Destiny has become one of the biggest names in the industry today. Maintaining a healthy player base three years after launch, Bungie's online shooter has been the latest success story for the developer — building a name close to overshadowing its own Halo series.Four expansions, hundreds of hours, and an endless onslaught of loot later, the game's successor, Destiny 2, has finally hit store shelves. Delivering a much-improved Story mode, a slew of enhancements to gameplay and a much deeper ecosystem, the game is already shaping up to be one of the biggest launches in 2017. And while Destiny 2 may live up to its promises, many of these stray from being a true evolution.Destiny 2 kicks off shortly after the events of the first game, with players flying into the Last City – the final outpost and safe haven for humanity, protected by the presence the Traveler. The mysterious orb still hovers above the city, serving as the source of ""Light"" which gives Guardians their strength and abilities in combat. However, upon arrival, the settlement is found in a fiery state of disrepair, amid an all-out assault from the ""Red Legion"" faction, led by Dominus Ghaul.Ghaul believes the Light was delivered to humanity in error and in an attempt to harness its power, commands his forces to take over the city and capture the Traveller. Regardless of your efforts, Red Legion forces are able to obstruct the Light of the Traveler, draining all powers from Earth's final defenses. Now vulnerable and missing the gift of Light, all Guardians flee the Tower in refuge across the solar system.Destiny 2's opening sets up the premise for the remainder of its narrative, in a quest to regain your Light from the Traveler and use your powers to take down Ghaul. With your Vanguard sidekicks now in hiding, the game takes place across various new locations, to build up abilities, assemble a team and claim back your homeland.One of the principal focuses of its Destiny 2's story is character development, with a clear improvement on the events that took place in its predecessor. While in the first game, the mild storytelling felt like a bridge between gameplay, Destiny 2 better validates its inclusion with a much heavier focus on building the overarching world.Following the capture of the Traveller and the fall of the Last City, the story explores a new angle on the conflict, attempting to bring up the individual struggles of the entire cast. Each of the main characters has their own backgrounds and values behind wanting to avenge the Traveler's fall and throughout the game these are explored to build a greater understanding of each character's personality. Stretching further than mediocre radio banter goes a long way in making players emotionally invest in characters, and while Destiny 2 doesn't deliver revolutionary storytelling, simply adding further context and depth to the world is a welcome change to see.Stretching further than mediocre radio banter goes a long way when emotionally investing in characters.It should also be stressed how crucial the debut of Ghaul is to Destiny's story, clearly outlining him and his Red Legion army as distinct enemies amongst various existing conflicts in the world. Rather than ambiguously pushing ""the darkness"" as the main foe, Ghaul's presence sets a well-defined goal and helps with understanding the crux of the narrative no matter your investment.Destiny 2's opening starts out strong, with arguably some of best early hours of both gameplay and story I've experienced from a shooter in some time. Between its cinematic edge to gameplay, engaging environments, and perfectly synced score, your first endeavor into the world feels truly memorable. A blend of tense combat and heartfelt moments establish the exemplar of what Bungie strives to achieve and makes a striking sense of presence through its atmosphere.Destiny 2's opening starts out strong, with arguably some of best early hours of both gameplay and story I've experienced from a shooter.Despite its powerful opening, the momentum of Destiny 2's main campaign begins to dwindle over time, losing some of the charms during its opening hours of gameplay. After regaining your Light powers and moving onward to new locations, missions begin to feel less animated and lose their sense of awe, by falling into a structure reminiscent of the original. While the story is a major improvement upon the first game, a degradation in depth struggled to keep me fully engaged until the end credits.Looking back at what the original Destiny first offered, it's clear how far the studio has come in building up its world. In contrast to a predecessor that left me unsure if it had was even concluded after my first playthrough, Destiny 2 delivers a satisfying (although predictable) adventure that sparks deeper consideration for its universe. Wrapping up with a tease of what's to come for future content, it will be interesting to see if Bungie can maintain its delivery of richer story content through expansions.Three years on, the feel of combat in Destiny, and more specifically its gunplay, is still a major draw for many players. Destiny 2 offers an unrivaled level of fluidity and dynamism to even the smallest details in battle and still makes for one of the best feeling shooters on the market. The inheritance of groundwork from the original is blatant, but for anyone who spent mere minutes in its sandbox, it's no surprise Bungie has revived this winning formula.Destiny 2 offers an unrivaled level of fluidity and dynamism to even the smallest details.The feel of Destiny's combat is a major reason for why many (myself included) stuck with Destiny post-launch. It's loot and various activities may feel gratifying, but few shooters still feel as good to purely pick up and play. Each of the game's weapons, both new and returning, feel satisfying to handle and are only complemented by responsive controls built with controllers in mind.As an extension of your abilities in combat, Destiny 2 also introduces three new subclasses – a route to pursue under your main class, which determines the contents of your skills and upgrade tree. Of the new subclasses, one has been added to Titans, Warlocks, and Hunters – while disposing of some established in the original game. When first reclaiming your Light, all classes dive straight into the new subclass, with opportunities to unlock your secondary and tertiary entries to follow.Although these subclasses and their abilities deliver some tweaks to gameplay, there are clear parallels to those from the first game. Aside from the Titan's badass ""Captain America"" style shield, the new subclasses and their abilities fail to feel like true evolutions in gameplay.In terms of raw new content, one of Destiny 2's biggest additions is four new locations to explore. Earth returns, with a new area known as the European Dead Zone (EDZ), both Titan and Io introduce new moons within our Solar System and Nessus takes combat to a planetoid for the first time in series history. Each of these is an entirely new area detached from Destiny, with those from the first game no longer accessible in the sequel.Greater variety in the level themes has led to more varied gameplay, including fleeting mechanics based on set pieces.Destiny 2 generally displays a major step up in level design, with richer and more engaging environments over those seen in the first game. As expected from the franchise, these worlds still look stunning even on standard Xbox One hardware – thanks to fantastic art direction and environmental design. Whereas in the first game, later environments were felt like a heartless backdrop at times, both personality and lifelessness can be felt through a majority of Destiny 2's locations.These changes also feed into gameplay, with environments now having a greater effect on how certain missions play. Greater variety in the level themes has led to more varied gameplay, including fleeting mechanics based on set pieces. Whether shielding from the burning rays of the sun aboard a space ship or diving into the twisted salt mines of the EDZ, these moments stand out as memorable locations through your journey.Aside from the aforementioned big changes, a lot of core content seen in Destiny 2 draws a lot from the first game. I could spend hours listing all the minor changes seen throughout the entire ecosystem, but ultimately, a huge push has been made to improve quality of life inside its world. From the new system behind equipping weapons, improvements between navigating open worlds and attempts to remove cumbersome elements of progression – Destiny 2 feels like successful refinement upon Bungie's original vision.And though these changes are all welcome, this leads to one of my biggest gripes with Destiny after sinking hours into the game. In terms of core gameplay, Destiny 2 does little to stand out from the original. To an extent, this was expected – as you'd assume from a Destiny successor, influence should be taken from the first installment. But in many situations, the game offers improvements without offering a true evolution.In terms of core gameplay, Destiny 2 does little to stand out from the original.Without the addition of a new class, no new major enemy factions or other noteworthy changes to shake up gameplay, what emerges is still an experience very much like the original. For fans already invested in the universe this should be a welcome sight, but for those not enticed by the gameplay offered previously, there are still aspects that will irritate skeptics.As seasoned veterans know, after completing the main campaign, Destiny still has a lot of content to offer. Both Strikes and Crucible remain key parts of the package in Destiny 2 and are crucial modes for those looking to invest in the long term.Strikes return in Destiny 2 with mostly the same formula, throwing a team of three players into cooperative missions with additional depth upon your average campaign mission. In their latest revision Strikes are more-likened to small Raids – taking advantage of creative platforming and combat traits, usually reserved for the game's expansive six-man missions. After many criticized the first Destiny's bosses for being needlessly drawn out, each of the Strikes now has its own mechanics to understand and adapt to in the heat of conflict.While Crucible has only seen some minor changes this time around, Destiny 2 still improves upon the mode in several ways. The biggest of these is the new 4v4 player versus player (PvP) setup, which reduces the number contestants per match from ten to eight. Although seemingly trivial in the scope of the sandbox, this already changes up the core pacing of how Crucible is played. The new Countdown mode also shows promise in its current state, taking the well-established ""plant the bomb"" gameplay seen in other popular shooters of today.For those who enjoyed Destiny the first time around, Destiny 2 has so much to offer – even for returning players.So, in the long term, how will Destiny 2's longevity hold up? Although we're still in the early days of the game's lifecycle, the game clearly has a lot to offer as a part of the package. With several of the game's modes returning, there's promise for the game to maintain a dedicated player based better than vanilla Destiny, although how post-launch support is handled will have a huge bearing on this.As of writing, Bungie has a wide range of content in the pipeline for Destiny 2 – from both new experiences and returning favorites. After launch, one of the franchise's most praised modes is making a comeback with the ""Leviathan"" raid, while high-stakes ""Trials"" PvP is also around the corner for competitive players. Other promised features to flesh out the Destiny ecosystem, such as Clans and Guided Games, are also seeing staggered rollouts in the weeks to come. And that's not even touching on the two paid expansions, which will be hitting the game in the months ahead. Whether this content will satisfy players later down the line is yet to be seen, but Bungie is already showing some signs of building upon the missteps of the first game.Overall, while I've enjoyed my time with Destiny 2 so far, it's a game I'm still conflicted about today. On the one hand, its a rewarding shooter with both mechanics and worlds packed with potential, however, clear shortcomings in the scale of its improvements leave much to be desired.If anything, Bungie has clearly refined upon the first Destiny, building upon what made the game so good, while avoiding some of its weaknesses. For those who enjoyed Destiny the first time around, Destiny 2 has so much to offer – even for returning players. But at its core, those who weren't fans of the original won't find major revelations in this sequel.This review was conducted on Xbox One using a copy provided by the publisher.Matt Brown was formerly a Windows Central's Senior Editor, Xbox & PC, at Future.

Destiny 2,Sam White,Telegraph,http://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/reviews/destiny-2-review-accomplished-rewarding-fun/,"From Destiny 2’s first moments it’s a bigger, bolder and better game than its predecessor. While the familiarities – and some of the flaws – of the first game are immediately apparent, there’s more purpose and a better sense of direction than Bungie ever achieved with the 2014 original.The campaign is coherent. The set-pieces are more impressive, both visually and in scope. The pacing is more accomplished. The multiplayer aspects are better structured so you don’t feel alone if you don’t have a roster of friends to party up with at all times. Activities and tasks are administered to you at a far better rate, too, resulting in a game that doesn’t just draw the curtains on its own campaign and leave you to figure out what it is you’re supposed to do next.It’s a game that is sure to evolve more over time as Bungie adds more content much like it did with the original’s handful of different sized expansions. But the current launch build of Destiny 2 is already well beyond where the original was 3 years ago. It’s still something we’re discovering  as we progress – we've not completed the 6-player Raid, for example, which promises the most challenging of Destiny 2’s puzzles and bosses. But we're desperate to play more.Destiny 2’s wonderful feedback loop of first person shooter satisfaction is its key draw. It's the thing that'll grab you initially and it's the thing that'll keep you returning. The gunplay remains some of the best in the business, and with every new rare weapon you unlock there’s an immense journey of discovery as you shoot it for the first time, experiment with its special abilities, and plaster it with your customisable skins to tailor it to the perfect “look” for your superhero-esque avatar. This was always a strong point of the original game, and the weapon and armour teams haven’t missed a step in creating a ton of gear that you truly want to have in your arsenal.Progression is constant from the get go, but gently slows as you level past the game’s level 20 cap and move into the Power system – a ranking that levels you according to the strength of the loot you acquire by completing missions and challenges. Everything in Destiny 2 adheres to this ranking, which means you have to follow its loop of missions, adventures (new to Destiny 2, these are great side quests), Strikes (tougher multiplayer missions) and Patrols (freeform activities out in the over world) to keep up the constant slew of new weapons and armour. As you do so you’ll become stronger and stronger.That climb to ultimate strength starts with a devastating fall from grace. Destiny 2’s campaign starts with your character and his pals – a group who are blessed with the light of the Traveller, a mysterious moon sized orb that saved humanity from the darkness – being attacked by a big baddie called Dominus Ghaul. As a member of the alien faction called the Cabal, Ghaul has come to Earth to trap the Traveller’s light for his own nefarious use. It’s an opener that strips you of your powers and sends you running with your tail between your legs – you lose your weapons, your levels and your abilities, and set up camp in a nomadic outpost called The Farm.From there, you attempt to piece the band back together in order to mount a retaliation against Ghaul. The campaign is better paced and more expertly told, and its proceeding 6 - 7 hours pack a string of brilliant missions, especially in its final third. It’s not going to set the world on fire, narrative wise, and it has a middle portion that sags as it sends you across various beautiful parts of the solar system completing  different  objectives, but it's still the best story that Bungie has told since Halo. It evokes memories of the Master Chief's heyday, from the great mission design to the way it uses an amazing score to punctuate its most intense action set piece moments.So, while the campaign is the first thing you’ll play in Destiny 2 – a design decision that threads you through learning the basic core parts of the game – it’s the aftermath of the story that really adds up to much more impressive experience.The new Adventures are a great way to see more of the game’s several open hubs – there’s a lush part of a futuristic Earth, an alien expanse on the Jovian moon of Io, the swelling methane seas of the Saturn moon of Titan, and the truly bizarre dwarf world of Nessus – in extensive unique missions that often feel like full campaign quests in their own right. Lost Sectors are another brilliant addition that offer vaguely signposted portions of the map that you can delve into to discover new areas that reward you with significant loot, and it adds up to a far more comprehensive open world shooter experience.Other parts of Destiny 2 – the aforementioned Strikes, Patrols, the Raid, as well as the multiplayer arena known as the Crucible – are all familiar but improved. Strikes add a deeper layer of interaction this time around, from environmental obstacles like an enormous spinning drill, to more dynamic boss fights that require more thought than just shooting. That isn't to say Destiny 2 has suddenly cast off its bullet sponge foes, but there's less of a grind and more of a meaningful trajectory.All your objectives are tracked in the Director, which is an excellent way of keeping up to speed on everything you can do and how close you are to further milestones (which reward you with yet more loot).Ultimately, Destiny 2’s end goal is succeeding in the long game. Who knows if all of this content, while vastly improved and more varied, will keep players entertained in a month, or three months time. It’s now up to Bungie to keep up the momentum. Destiny 2 is more accomplished, more rewarding and more fun than its predecessor ever was and that’s a hugely impressive achievement. Years ago, when Bungie first announced the series, they promised a 10 year journey. The first game failed to deliver that dream, but with Destiny 2 we have moved a hell of a lot closer."
Destiny 2,Alex Hern,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/14/destiny-2-review-sequel-shooting-online,"Bungie has improved its sci-fi shooter with a less lonely game for those who don’t have online friends and a more rewarding one for those who do There are three reviews of Destiny 2 that need to be written.The first is Destiny 2: the campaign, the game that you can sit down and play through from start to finish. It’s a genuinely good experience, with a plot that makes sense, characters who have actual personalities, and a narrative delivered through more than just text inserts and mission descriptions.Take the opening mission, Homecoming, which is already familiar to those who played the beta. It would be perfectly possible to write an entire review focusing on this 30-minute experience, a textbook in game design laid out perfectly for the player.You begin, unlike in the first game, with a fully powered-up guardian, dropped into the middle of an all-out attack on the Tower, last cradle of humanity in a far flung future. Over a snappy string of set-pieces, the game introduces new players to the core cast of Cayde-6, Zavala and Ikora Rey, teaches them the basics of combat and of their special abilities, and drops plenty of fan service in the background for returning players. Most impressively, the level silently communicates the importance of teamwork, matchmaking players into groups of three in the background before throwing them in a larger space where they get to see the effects of other classes’ super abilities, and find out their own abilities get recharged when their allies succeed.A twist of the narrative later, and your guardian finds themselves wracked, depowered, and stumbling through the crumbling remnants of the Last City. The canny design doesn’t end quite yet, with the game smoothly introducing a final few concepts (you try to jump over a ledge you can’t quite clear, only to discover the game now offers “mantling”, letting your character pull themselves up from near-missed jumps), and your character slowly finding their way to allies. Strings swell, a falcon soars, and you realise this is perhaps the first time Destiny has ever done more than telling a story: it’s evoking a feeling.From there, admittedly, things plateau a bit. Most of the rest of the campaign is a fun romp, a getting-the-band-back-together cliché with a few diversions here and there, before everything comes together in an all-out raid on the City, and the end credits roll.Look: you aren’t going to be writing letters home about this plot. Even for an MMO, it’s fairly thin, lacking the epic sweep that players of more traditional online games like WoW or FFXV have come to expect. But it’s the first time in the three years of Destiny’s history that you can reasonably say to the sort of person who bought the Halo series to play through the single-player campaign that the Bungie they know and love is back.But about three quarters of the way through the campaign, Destiny 2 (the single-player game) takes a short excursion, introducing you to its true form: Destiny 2 (the eternal experience). That’s the second review that needs to be written.It’s a far smoother introduction than that of the first game, which unceremoniously dropped you from the end credits back in the game world with no real explanation of how to progress, what the next goal was, or why you were still playing. Now, in the midst of the campaign, the game takes the time to introduce the activities you’ll spend the next few months repeating, once the story is over: the patrols, the strikes and the crucible. By the time you do finish the campaign, you’ll likely be champing at the bit to sink some real time into these things.It’s when it comes to the variety and enjoyment of these activities that Destiny 2 shines. Compared to earlier iterations of the game, where players rapidly realised that one and only one gameplay loop offered valuable rewards, here Destiny goes out of its way to offer you an incentive to range widely over its cornucopia of delights. That hasn’t stopped players finding a marginally more rewarding loop, even so (if you’re a min-maxer, expect to spend a lot of time on Titan over the first few months), but it does mean the days of running in circles through Archer’s Line on the moon desperately farming Helium Filaments are over.New clan features also mean the game is a far less lonely experience for those without many online friends, and a far more rewarding one for those who are used to playing with a group. Destiny rewards you for being in a clan – any clan – and then heaps further rewards on clans that play together.The core gameplay loop has always worked on a narrow level, because the Bungie team are, and always have been, the masters of making gunplay satisfying on a minute-to-minute level. Shooting aliens in the head feels good in this game, and when you start receiving exotic weapons in the latter half, it feels even better.But the wider loop, of continually getting new and better loot, spiralling your character towards the level cap, is also improved. It’s no longer a toxic fruit machine, and the number of guaranteed rewards in the game is at a level where it’s possible to avoid huge levels of frustration entirely. There’s a chance, in fact, that it may be too generous: a game with a level cap of 300 should probably not see players reaching 293 within a week, before the raid was even released, as a member of my clan did. That’s a hollow complaint, though, and if your only problem is you play the game too efficiently, then you’ll probably find other things in its gargantuan world to occupy you soon after.The last review is for those who’ve been clinging to the first game for three years, who just need to be reassured that everything’s still on track: Destiny 2 is Destiny without the bullshit. Almost.Everything you hated about the first three years of the game has been refined, removed, or reappraised, and the game that was left was one that makes sense from toe to tip. And then Bungie added in just a little bit of extra bullshit, focused on endgame micro-transactions: Sparrows are now cosmetic items you receive randomly in the game’s lootbox-style “bright engrams”; shaders, received the same way, are now single-use items, received in packs of three to five; and the faintest whiff of non-cosmetic paid upgrades exists in the armour and weapon “modifications”, which you receive in the same way and use to boost your gear.It’s not the end of the world, but it’s a small preview of where you’re likely to feel greatest irritation most rapidly. Ultimately, how it plays out in the long term comes down to how free the game is with these drops: currently, it looks like the intention is only to soak those who really want one specific exotic emote, or set of shaders. If that remains the case, I’ll get over it."
Destiny 2,Jason Rodriguez,PC Invasion,https://www.pcinvasion.com/destiny-2-season-of-the-chosen-review/,"It’s time for yet another season in Destiny 2. With the threat of Savathun and the Darkness looming in the distance, Guardians will have to face another foe seeking endless power. This “big bad” in Destiny 2: Season of the Chosen happens to be Empress Caiatl, the daughter of our tubby pal Calus.Yes, at a glance, Destiny 2: Season of the Chosen seems disconnected from the reality of the universe being built around you. But, the more I played, the more I experienced qualms and doubts about Bungie’s newest offering. The moment you launch Destiny 2: Season of the Chosen, you’re treated to a cinematic where Osiris chides the Vanguard for resting on their laurels and neglecting to prepare. Next, you see Zavala and Osiris negotiating with Empress Caiatl. This Cabal leader was someone who betrayed Calus to Ghaul, the Guardian’s nemesis in the vanilla campaign. Her goal: make the Guardians bow down to the Cabal Empire much to Zavala’s and Osiris’ chagrin.The narrative, once again, leaps from a potential catastrophe to an emerging threat. The key difference here is that we already know about the Cabal’s motivations. Their galaxy-spanning military is out to take systems by force. It’s as one-dimensional as it gets. To go from communing with the Darkness in Beyond Light to yet another villain with paper-thin characterization can be jarring.If the term “jarring” applies to the narrative, then using it on the core gameplay loop would be an understatement. Given the Cabal’s penchant for dominance, the Vanguard aims to prevent all-out war by “challenging champions” and “proving your might.” This leads the player to partake in Battlegrounds, which are short romps through locations that you’ve seen before. The only difference now is that you’re contending with countless Cabal foes.A Battleground run lasts around ten minutes, a mini-strike, if you will. The mechanics are the usual mishmash such as kill a lot of mobs, pick up balls and throw ’em, and shoot the thing so the boss loses its shield.  And that’s just the first part of Destiny 2: Season of the Chosen‘s gameplay loop.The second part combines the above with the Hammer of Proving. It has related mechanics such as Cabal Gold, Tribute Chests, the Prismatic Recaster, and Umbral Engrams (these last two were seen in the Season of Arrivals). Your tasks consist of completing playlist activities to obtain Cabal Gold for your Hammer of Proving, slotting a rune using that Cabal Gold, finishing a Battleground run to smash a Tribute Chest, gaining a charge for your hammer, visiting the H.E.L.M. command center, and, finally, using the hammer’s stored charges to focus an Umbral Engram via the Prismatic Recaster. Lather, rinse, and repeat.Does that sound needlessly convoluted and disconnected? Yes. It doesn’t help matters that the previous iteration of the engram-focusing feature was more straightforward, even earning Bungie a bit of praise from the community.Unfortunately, the current implementation leaves a lot to be desired. It’s like Bungie combined the runes from the Chalice of Opulence, the charges from Wrathborn Hunts, and the general “kill X number of mobs” tallies for exotic catalysts. And these are just to let you focus a single Umbral Engram type.Likewise, it bears mentioning that Hammer of Proving’s upgrades are time-gated, with several perks requiring rank-ups via reputation from seasonal/weekly challenges. This, too, seems like a contrived method of presenting you with bounties. In a way, the grind feels even grindier than before. That leads to a situation where mechanics and features that ought to be simple turn into artificially-padded progression.Destiny 2: Season of the Chosen has one ritual weapon, the Salvager’s Salvo grenade launcher. It’s far from being the next Mountaintop, and I doubt I’d replace my energy slot with that in PvP. As for exotics, the only weapon that’s been released so far is Ticuu’s Divination, which is a bow with tracking shots that tickle mobs. Needless to say, it’s a disappointment.As for other legendary weapons, dozens have been added to the loot pool. There might be a few that’ll become fixtures in the long run such as the Shadow Price auto rifle, Brass Attacks sidearm, Extraordinary Rendition SMG, and The Palindrome hand cannon. The main downside here is that too many of these items fill the aforementioned energy slot. I’m reminded of the Garden of Salvation raid from Shadowkeep when lots of drops were energy weapons.It’s too early to tell if these will offset the effects of sunsetting. Moreover, several weapons are either from Destiny 1 or are “reprised” versions — you’re essentially redoing activities and praying to the RNG gods for the perfect roll even though the sunsetted version of the item might have been fine already.Regarding Stasis, the subclass is still a nightmare in competitive play. Titans and Hunters maximize its effectiveness, and Warlocks can only look on in sadness. This season also has new Stasis aspects and fragments (and aspects are obtained rather quickly).Lastly, Bungie did add a couple of strikes, but these (Devil’s Lair and Fallen Saber) are from Destiny 1. In fact, the Fallen Saber strike can’t be accessed at all. As for the strike that’s actually new (Proving Grounds), it won’t be live until March 23.As of now, Destiny 2: Season of the Chosen neither excites nor keeps me engaged. The “core gameplay loop” might as well be called the “chore gameplay loop” owing to the mechanics involved. But, these are just my impressions from the first few days. I’ll see what else is in store in the coming week since the game will have another Battleground map. Likewise, since there are new and reissued weapons, I’ll be gunning for better rolls (pun intended) just to see if the loot pool is more vibrant.Folks know that Destiny 2 is an evolving game and its seasonal structure leads to further developments down the line. Season of the Chosen is hardly different in that manner. Still, the past couple of weeks gave Guardians plenty to talk about. The second week saw The Presage exotic mission which, upon completion, led to the Dead Man’s Tale exotic scout rifle as a reward. That’s followed by the master difficulty version that went live this week, awarding the catalyst for the weapon.The Presage mission, which takes place aboard a derelict Cabal ship filled with Scorn, puzzles, and various secrets, is a treat from start to finish. It’s worthy of being heralded as one of the best and most unique world spaces, mentioned in the same breath as The Whisper and Zero Hour. But, it’s not something you’ll play every week (unless you’re looking for more random rolls for the exotic)Outside of The Presage, the weekly experience I’ve had has been a monotonous, tedious slog. It was punctuated by the Empress Caiatl storyline and Battleground runs/Challenger’s Proving quests cited earlier, all for a few hammer charges just to focus a single engram. Funnily enough, you can complete your weapon tally kills and get five charges for each focusing action you’d do to get a single tier 3 engram. Even then, all your efforts won’t guarantee you the rolls, let alone the specific weapon, that you need. So, yes, my opinion from the first week until now hasn’t changed: Season of Arrivals had a better implementation of this mechanic.Now, do you want to farm for Nightfall-specific weapons? You can do that, but you’ll need to climb to reach the power cap once more (or boost your artifact’s XP) since, naturally, the mobs you used to beat up now have a higher power level. Will you actually get decent or even god rolls? Well, that’s still up to RNG. With more perks to choose from nowadays, these actually lower the percentage of getting the right combinations.How about getting reissued items? I personally feel that the idea of reissuing gear is more of an insult. You’re farming again for the items you’ve obtained before, and the reason you’re farming is that they were made useless last season. Oh, and as for the PvP side of things, you’re not missing out. Trials of Osiris is home to a dwindling number of “sweats,” with more people jumping to their doom to get a weapon after three games. As for Iron Banner, you’ll be playing Control (again) and getting refurbished armor (again). It feels like we’re really stuck in a Vex time loop.Yes, Destiny 2: Season of the Chosen, like all the previous ones, has its ups and downs. Sadly, once you’re done experiencing the rush of something new, you’re back to the grind that, many years later, hasn’t improved. Worse, if the umbral engrams mechanic is any indication, it’s as though Bungie can’t follow through with something that was once successful and well-received. Will the Proving Grounds activity change all that on March 23? Only time will tell. For now, you’re left with nearly a month of the same old stuff. In any case, whether you’re tired, disappointed, hopeful, or still giddy, you can check out our Destiny 2: Season of the Chosen guides and features hub.Destiny 2: Season of the Chosen truly manages to capture your attention owing to The Presage exotic quest. Outside of this, the excitement of seeing Battlegrounds for the first time and the high mob density in the Devil's Lair strike will wear off. Soon, you'll realize that you're back to that monotonous grind. It's made even worse by an emphasis on gaining more charges, rerunning playlists given all the vaulted content, and a ridiculous change to the Umbral Engrams system that was previously well-received.About Us

Destiny 2,Mark Kriska,PlayStation Universe,https://www.psu.com/reviews/destiny-2-destiny-2-beyond-light-ps5-review/," Mark Kriska / December 14, 2020Destiny 2 Beyond Light PS5 Review – Beyond Light just launched a few weeks ago. While the game loaded quicker on PS5, the full update to truly take advantage of most next-gen features has released for PS5. These advantages range from improved frame rates to a field-of-view slider. While not all features of the PS5 are taken advantage of, everything that has been updated here is a game-changer. Literally.While most of this review will focus on the enhancements the PS5 update brings to Destiny 2 overall, there has been some new content even since we published our Destiny 2 Beyond Light review. I will be touching on these new developments as well, but this will mostly be a technical focused review.Frame rate and pixels have never really been high on my list of importance. The story and gameplay loops are what pull me in and keep me playing most games. Meanwhile, console gamers would consistently hear about frame rates, no load times, and resolutions being a major focus for PC players. While these things are still something I don’t play games for, I now see the appeal and how they can make an already great experience even better.Destiny 2 now runs at a super smooth 60 frames-per-second in PvE content and up to 120 FPS for PvP. This is a huge improvement and makes the game feel much faster. Friends of mine who spent more of their time in other first-person shooters, like Call of Duty, often complain about how slow Guardians feel. This PS5 update goes a long way to silencing those criticisms.Summoning your Sparrow, racing across Europa, jumping off, and maintaining your momentum to headshot a Fallen Dreg on a glacier peak is exhilarating. In tandem with the unmatched gunplay that Bungie is known for, the new sense of speed makes Destiny 2 unrivalled as a first-person shooter, at least in terms of gameplay.PvE isn’t the only part of the game to see an improvement from the higher frame rates. As mentioned above, PvP has received a boost to 120 frames-per-second. Personally, I couldn’t tell the difference between 60 and 120. However, this has been a running issue in my life. Nevertheless, from what I can tell from friends online, not to mention my increased average to my kill/death ratio, the higher frames do indeed help. This, along with the decreased number of cheaters on the console, are more than enough of a reason to jump back over from PC.Quick frame rates aren’t the only thing Beyond Light for PS5 offers. If you played Destiny 2 on PS4 at all, you know how slow it would load. It took multiple minutes even to select your character and what felt like hours to change gear. There was no debating that up to date PCs running SSDs had a clear advance. That was until now.Getting from the home screen to the Tower on PS4 took roughly around two minutes. Meanwhile, on PS5, load times get basically cut in half. Granted, some of this has to do with the reduced content Destiny 2 received in Beyond Light. Before removing destinations, Destiny 2 on PS4 took upwards of five minutes to fully load.Load times aren’t the only advantages Destiny 2 receives from the SSD. Your character menu can now be entered into in under one second. This may seem like a small advantage but is actually a game-changer. In the heat of battle, seconds make all of the difference, and the ability to jump into your character, change some gear or weapons, and get back to the action in less time than just loading your character on PS4 is a night and day difference. It can win a Crucible match or save a resurrection in a raid.Along with super fast frame-rates and load times, the Destiny 2 PS5 update also brings a Field of View slider. This is something I never really heard players talk about. However, this has been the most visible change I’ve seen in the PS5 update. Along with 4K support, these potentially ultra-wide shots give Destiny a sense of scale.With the addition of FoV, the upscaling to 4K resolution has made Destiny 2 look crisp. As a lifelong Destiny player, these small but impactful changes have made Destiny 2 feel like a brand new game.With that being said, there is one glaring omission to the next-gen update. The lack of DualSense support isn’t surprising, but it isn’t forgettable either. Other games like Fortnite and Warframe have both included the DualSense in their own PS5 update, and it’s something I hope Bungie addresses in the future.It’s still unclear how much effort actually goes into developing features for the DualSense. Regardless, the feeling of you’re Super erupting in the controller, or the different feelings of Hand Cannons vs. Auto Rifles would be a lot of fun. Since the launch of the PS5, I’ve become a true believer in the new technology Sony incorporated into their new DualSense, and it’s something I hope everyone in the industry takes advantage of.Nevertheless, even without full DualSense support, the vibration itself is slightly more noticeable on the controller’s better haptic motor. Jumping in the tower and feeling your Guardian hit the ground and riding your sparrow felt more intense. I was constantly asking myself if these were new features or just enhances.I was even forced to boot up my PS4 and load up Destiny to make sure the game vibrated in those sections as well on last-gen. With that being said, I would have loved dedicated support for the DualSense to fully take advantage of a truly next-gen feature.In a lot of ways, Destiny 2 feels like a new game on PS5. With all of the enhancements we talked about, the game has never looked or felt better on console. Nevertheless, a large number of players are still playing the game on PS4. With these two player bases being part of the same ecosystem in a cross-play world, these players shouldn’t feel left out. Bungie has gone above and beyond to make sure that they aren’t.Although the game has received all of the bells and whistles on PS5, it never feels held back by PS4. I jumped back and forth a few times between PS4 and PS5 to truly understand the differences. A few of my clan members have been unlucky in acquiring a PS5, but even while raiding, there was no apparent disadvantage to the last-gen players. Four of the six of us had been lucky enough to get our hands on the PS5, and outside of personal experience, there seemed to be no advantage to one group or another.This is something I truly commend Bungie for. More often than not, when a developer enhances its game for next-gen, the last-gen version feels archaic and awful in comparison. Destiny 2 somehow updated its game to feel leagues better without sacrificing quality for its players who haven’t stepped into the next generation of consoles.Rest assured that no matter what version of Destiny 2 you currently are playing, you are going to have an amazing experience. From the newly added Hawkmoon quest to the raid, Destiny 2 is an amazing experience for all players.Destiny 2 and the original Destiny have been where I spent most of my gaming time during the last seven years. Yes, I have taken breaks to avoid being burnt out and to play other titles I’m excited for. Nevertheless, I can honestly say Destiny has never been in a better place. From a steady stream of new content to content that truly changes the world.Bungie has seemingly figured out how to perfect the gameplay loop with Beyond Light. This, coupled with the next-gen improvements, has made Beyond Light one of the most important updates in Destiny history. While I am disappointed with the lack of DualSense support, the new content that has been dropping, along with the return of the winter event The Dawning, have me very hopeful and excited for the next few weeks, not to mention months and years.Bungie has managed to take an already amazing feeling game on PS4 and enhance it to a new height while retaining that same feeling. This is something that blows me away every time I boot up Destiny 2 on PS5. In many cases, when jumping back to last-gen after playing a game’s PS5 counterpart, the PS4 version will feel slightly outdated. This isn’t the case with Destiny 2. The PS4 version of the game feels just as amazing as before; the PS5 update just takes what was already there and turns it up to 11.Destiny 2 and Destiny 2: Beyond Light are available now on PS5.Bungie has delivered an amazing experience with its PS5 update. From the silky-smooth frame rates to the field of view sliders, Destiny 2 has never felt this good. All the enhancements the PC community has been able to experience and take advantage of are finally on consoles. Cross-gen support along with the same content drops means that regardless of what console you play on, you're getting the best version of Destiny 2 that your system can run.

Destiny 2,Liam Croft,Push Square,http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/destiny_2,"GuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpDestiny 22020 7.4Game RatingUser Ratings: 134Our Review: Scroll DownNo time to explainVersion Reviewed: EuropeanA lot has changed for Destiny 2 in the three years since release. After launching as a full-priced product, it decided to take the free-to-play route in late 2019. After teaming up with Activision to bring both the original game and this sequel to market, Bungie cut ties with the publisher to do it alone. And after expanding the base game with two big pieces of DLC, a lot of content was recently removed so the developer can better handle and manage the experience. The popular looter shooter finds itself in an interesting position then as the PlayStation 5 version arrives — a significant update designed to enhance the game for those already playing rather than attract new players. This is the best Destiny 2 has ever looked and ran on consoles to date.While PC players have been enjoying Bungie's Halo follow-up at 60 frames-per-second for years, the same cannot be said of those on PlayStation 4 or even PS4 Pro. Last-gen systems were always capped at 30, creating a drastic difference between versions. That all disappears on PS5, however, as Sony diehards are finally given the chance to see what they've been missing out on. And it's a bit of a revelation.Destiny 2 has always felt great to play, with a copious amount of mobility options and fantastic gunplay. The PS5 version takes those mechanics to the next level as 60 frames-per-second makes for a smoother overall experience both in terms of how your controller inputs are reflected on-screen and your reaction times to those very enemies demanding a press of the R2 button. Combined with the slightly larger PS5 DualSense controller in your hands, it feels divine.That applies to all PvE content in the game, where you and a bunch of friends can team up and take on the armies of Darkness. With the recent release of Destiny 2: Beyond Light, a lot of new missions, quests, and destinations allow you to do just that should you wish to invest some cash. The free experience will introduce you to the world and its lore, but the good stuff still requires a purchase. In that sense, it's not a particularly great free-to-play offering.We're not done discussing frame rates though because Bungie has gone the extra mile to implement an optional 120 frames-per-second mode during PvP multiplayer matches. While only compatible with the best 4K TVs on the market, it provides a noticeable advantage over those competing at lower frame rates. Your reactions will be quicker, you'll spot enemies in the distance faster, and navigation of each map feels more fluid with gunplay that only gets better. Considering the game still matchmakes you against players on PS4, it almost feels unfair at times. The trade-off is a significant hit to visuals, to the point where it looks worse than what a base PS4 can produce. Of course, reaching such a high frame rate must be taxing on the hardware, but there is a very noticeable drop in graphical quality. It's up to you decide whether that's worth the slight tactical advantage.In the usual 60 frames-per-second mode though, Destiny 2 takes advantage of the PS5 to deliver better lighting, draw distances, and more detailed models at 4K. It's a significant improvement over what PlayStation players are used to and makes for a next-gen showpiece alongside Demon's Souls. Never has loading into the Tower been so impressive.Better yet, you'll actually get there faster than ever. Load times have been significantly reduced across the board, ensuring less time is spent waiting in orbit or travelling to a planet as assets and environments are put together. The PS5 SSD is to thank for that. No longer is there a delay between pressing the Options button and your inventory and loadout appearing — a real frustration the community has put up with for years in the heat of battle. If the frame rate boost isn't considered the best thing about Destiny 2 on PS5, the speedy load times most certainly are.But then that's about as far as Bungie goes supporting the next-gen console, with no room whatsoever for Activity Cards or DualSense controller implementation. The adaptive triggers feel exactly the same as the PS4 DualShock's counterpart and we've only got standard rumble to play around with. Disappointing omissions indeed — the ability to load straight into a Crucible match or the Tower from the PS5 home screen would have been a real gamechanger.It's a solid update then all things considered, but the best and worst thing about this next-gen version is that it is still very much Destiny 2. Its hardcore community is very much established and those potentially interested in giving the looter shooter a shot have most likely already done so. This PS5 version does absolutely nothing to change that — it’s simply a prettier and better running version. Clans committed to chasing the maximum Power level and mastering Raid encounters can continue doing so while newcomers find themselves overwhelmed with systems, mechanics, and levels as soon as they boot the game up. Fixing that particular issue was never the main objective of a PS5 version, but as we kick start a new generation, it's tough to avoid just how impenetrable Destiny 2 can be.The PS5 version of Destiny 2 caters entirely to its committed community with a smooth 60 frames-per-second that accentuates its tremendous gunplay, taking it to new heights for console players. Further perks include another frame rate mode in the triple figures and dramatically shorter load times to ensure the action comes quicker than ever. While new players will continue to be overwhelmed by almost everything it has to offer, Destiny 2 in the next generation is a crowd-pleaser for those already playing — a fanbase that has learned to both love and loathe the experience at the very same time.Good 7/10Scoring PolicyAbout Liam CroftLiam grew up with a PlayStation controller in his hands and a love for Metal Gear Solid. Nowadays, he can be found playing the latest and greatest PS5 games as well as supporting Derby County. That last detail is his downfall.Comments (15)“Big visual hit in 120 FPS mode”120 fps is fullhd hence no point in aiming for a 2.1 hdmi tv. Maybe a PS5 pro will change that but I am more than fine with 60fps.@LiamCroft Great review thanks, I love this game but I jumped off after the season of the Drifter as I didn't really like Gambit but I am itching to get back in. It will however have to be after Cyberpunk but D2 at 60 fps on PS5 is difficult to resist!@Mostik It does play really, really good at 60 FPS. Worth checking out if you already play the game!@LiamCroft I definitely will, did use the fov adjuster at all? I am reading do things about it.Said it when they showed the UI and will say it again. The cards/game help and the adaptive controllers will go the way of the dodo halfway through the PS5's lifecycle, there's no way that 3rd party will spend resources implementing those features in their games.@Mostik I messed about with it a little, but I honestly don't have any experience with this particular feature so I don't really know if it's any good or not in this instance.@LiamCroft
Another major improvement I noticed is the implementation of hdr. This was very poor until now, especially since beyond light a lot of colors were wrong and darks were crushed hard. But since yesterday the game is very vibrant and beautiful.I honestly couldn’t imagine playing Destiny 2 in 30FPS anyway! I dropped off after about 200 hours on PC, which is 60FPS, but I’d say I definitely got a whole lot of fun out of it.I still not avenged Cayde-6 🙄Maybe in 2021 I'll go back and play it again. Think I have 3 expansions at this point.th game still hasn't improved very much in the past two years unfortunately, forsaken was a great update, Beyond Light is the bare minimum they could get away withAs a player who used to Raid and be part of a clan (also got the platinum) it's STILL overwhelming to boot up. I want to get back into it, but you just don't know where to start once you fall off Destiny. Activity cards would also have been absolutely perfect for this game. A card to jump in crucible, a card for Gambit, for strikes, telling you the percentage of stuff you have to collect for weapons/loot. They could do so much here, and triggers is a no brainer. I hope Sony gives bungie some incentive to support these PS5 features.Neat, but 60FPS isn't gonna make me use precious PS5 storage on it. Take advantage of the dualsense like Siege, and we'll talk again.AVOID THIS PS5 VERSION IF YOUR A CLAN PLAYER!!!This Ps5 version sucks ass, You cant see your clan members on the roster OR clan screens, Your still in your clan BUT you cant play games with them because there on last gen!!!The Destiny games are a bit like Take That. They may have written their own songs and music, but man, they started something heinous.I'm tempted to give Destiny 2 a go at long last with the PS5 update. Enjoyed the first game but haven't touched the sequel, so I'll probably hop on it to get through the basic content and then move on. Sounds like the PS5 update has been well implemented for the most part, but it's a shame the haptics haven't been included (yet).

Destiny 2,Garrett Drake,COGconnected,http://cogconnected.com/review/destiny-2-pc-review/,"I’ve spent the last month and a half annihilating alien hordes, garnering gear, reaping loads of clan rewards, and scavenging the cosmic plains in the PS4 version of Destiny 2. And though I’ve grown weary and rather disinterested in the structure of the endgame content, I wasn’t at all reluctant to pay a visit to Bungie last week in order to get my hands on the PC version of the game. Having spent roughly six hours experiencing the campaign, world activities, and PvP, I’m confident in stating that I find Destiny 2 on PC to be the definitive version of the shared world shooter.If you had a chance to indulge in the PC beta, I trust you’re well aware of just how splendid the game feels when using a keyboard and mouse. You may have questioned the supposed lack of weapon recoil upon laying waste to your enemies as I did. I conducted an experiment of my own by firing various weapons down the sights and from the hip at a wall. Despite how it may feel, weapon recoil does exist. This begs to question how natural recoil control on keyboard and mouse will effect mods that assist with recoil. Thankfully, that was one of the first questions addressed during the roundtable discussion that fellow media personnel and I shared with a few of the game’s developers. According to David Shaw, the PC project lead at Bungie, the team at Vicarious Visions initially ported the exact structure of the game’s console controls to keyboard and mouse. To no surprise, it just didn’t feel right. He and the team promised that the existing recoil mods will function the same on PC as they do on console. Additionally, players can alter their crosshair positioning. By default, the crosshair resides in the direct center of the screen. If desired, players can switch the crosshair positioning to the console version. Following months of tweaking and refinement, Vicarious Visions have managed to develop a distinguished feel for the PC that stands entirely on its own in comparison to the console version. 
I initially adhered to the default controls but swiftly realized I’d rather take matters into my own hands. Mapping keys to your liking is quick and simple. Call me crazy, but I moved my melee ability from the C key to the click of the mouse wheel. Naturally, I spent the first several minutes unintentionally swapping weapons during melee attempts but eventually managed to get used to my questionable decision. I also moved my grenade from the Q key to one of the thumb buttons on the mouse. You may find my keyboard alterations to be ludicrous, but that’s the beauty of any game on keyboard and mouse. You can manipulate the hell out of the controls in order to satisfy your play style. I also briefly got my hands on a PS4 controller with the intention to compare and contrast. The higher frame rate obviously provides a silkier feel, but to my own astonishment, using a controller on PC feels nearly identical to playing on console. While chatting with the devs I was informed that they intentionally made an effort to mirror the feel of the controller on consoles. They’re aware that some players may prefer to kick back and relax with a controller and decided that it’s important to maintain a consistent feel across all platforms. Subtle aim assist does exist while using a controller, but it doesn’t feel quite at sticky as it does on console. If you need a break from the keyboard and mouse you can instantly pick up a controller and keep playing, or vice versa.___________________________“Vicarious Visions have managed to develop a distinguished feel for the PC that stands entirely on its own in comparison to the console version.”Match the controls with either VSync or an uncapped frame rate, and you’re in for one buttery smooth experience. Though I believe the game feels immaculate while locked at 60fps, I did dabble with an uncapped frame rate for an extended period of time. During my playtime, I reached between 150-180 frames on menu and map screens and ranged between 60-95 frames during hectic combat scenarios. Remarkably, I never once dipped below 60 frames with the uncapped option enabled. Players also have the option to lock their frame rate at whichever number they desire. If a precise 86 frames float your boat, you’re able to lock it down. Players seeking to lock the game at a max of 200fps or beyond will obviously need an incredibly powerful rig and/or have to compensate by lowering the visuals in order to maintain a consistent performance. In terms of PvP, variable frame rates came into question. The developers claim that variable frame rates will not affect competitive encounters. Personally, I believe if someone’s confined to playing the game at 30fps on a potato versus an individual rolling at 120fps on a mega-rig, there’s bound to be some sort of an effect. Only time will tell. Visually, I struggle to notice a major difference between 60-200+ frames. However, I can certainly feel the difference. Whether I’m popping Cabal heads, tossing grenades, or making swift 180 degree turns, the game feels outstanding to play.I’ve spent well over a hundred hours in Destiny 2 on a PS4 Pro. It’s certainly a pretty game on a console, but it pales when juxtaposed with the breathtaking 4K visuals on PC; especially with HDR enabled. From the heavily saturated colors of the starlit skies to the light reflecting off of your weapons, the graphics are simply stunning. As expected, everything from FOV, draw distance, to texture quality can be altered within the settings. I briefly cranked all of the settings to ultra at an uncapped frame rate and managed to complete a public event while encountering minimal hiccups. If you’re in possession of a supercomputer, you’ll more than likely be able to continually run the game at its utmost potential. The only similarity between console and PC are the in-game cutscenes and animated cutscenes. The in-game scenes are still presented at 30fps, and the animated scenes run at what I assume to be 23.976fps. It’s a bit jarring to jump from 120 frames to 30 in an instant, and though it tends to break immersion, it didn’t ultimately hinder my experience.Aside from using a mic, there are three forms of text communication at player’s disposals. Fireteam chat can be enabled by pressing Enter on the keyboard, while team chat can be enabled by pressing /T. Additionally, in classic Blizzard fashion, whispers can be used to chat with friends across other games and in Destiny 2’s public spaces. The public spaces whisper function is disabled by default but can be enabled within the settings. The text functionalities are great, but the game is currently lacking two important options; one being more crucial than the other. In its current state, Destiny 2 is lacking the options of general chat and clan chat. Seeing as clans are such an integral component of the game’s design, it seems as though the ability to chat with your online clan mates in-game would be a no-brainer. You can still chat with clan members via the Destiny 2 app, but that’s exactly what was wrong with the first game. Players shouldn’t need to seek outside sources in order to simply communicate.  The same applies to general chat. Sure, if I’m flying solo on Nessus and find myself in need of an extra hand, I can send a whisper to any of the players within my vicinity to call for help. However, there’s no promise that every player will have their whisper option enabled. Therefore, connecting with new players will be drastically hindered by the lack of general chat. In a game pitched as a ‘shared world shooter’, players are surprisingly limited with text to chat options. The developers have stated that they’ll be actively listening to community feedback as the game progresses. I imagine that the lack of clan chat, specifically, will be one of the first major issues addressed.___________________________“Whether I’m popping Cabal heads, tossing grenades, or making swift 180 degree turns, the game feels outstanding to play.”My thoughts on Destiny 2’s story remain the same, but my impressions of the endgame content have altered after having spent over a hundred hours grinding away on PS4. I find the token system to be rather discouraging in comparison to Destiny 1’s reputation system. I’d much rather grind for specific pieces of gear that I’m assured of receiving versus receiving random items from legendary engrams. The journey from a power level of 265 to 305 is grueling, and players who are looking to reach max level as soon as possible are limited to weekly milestones and public events. Milestones are spectacular, but I’d love to see them expanded. The addition of more challenges and rewards added to standard strikes and adventures could be a good starting point. At the moment, I have no motivation to complete anything outside of public events, the weekly Nightfall strike, Trials, and the raid. Lost Sectors were a blast to initially discover and explore, but now I have no interest in revisiting them. All of the resources are at Bungie’s disposal, and they have the ability to build upon the great features that already exist within the game.As far as the content schedule is concerned, the launch of Destiny 2 on PC will mirror the first two weeks of the console version. The Leviathan Raid will debut a week after release, and Trials of the Nine will begin the following weekend. Once the first two weeks conclude, the PC version will remain in sync with the content schedule and patches of the console versions. That leaves one final question in the balance: Will we ever be able to make a one time transfer of our console characters to PC? The developers stated, “It’s something we’d love to do, there’s nothing to announce at this time, but it’s certainly something we think about.” I’m keeping my fingers crossed for that one. Though I’ve already experienced everything the game currently has to offer on console, Destiny 2 on PC truly feels like a brand new experience. Player choice is at its core and I took full advantage of every option at my disposal. I’ve always been a console guy at heart, but I have every intention of transitioning to Destiny 2 on PC when it launches on October 24th.
