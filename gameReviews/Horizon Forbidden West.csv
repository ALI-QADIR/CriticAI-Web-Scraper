Horizon Forbidden West,Malindy Hetfeld,Eurogamer,https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2022-02-14-horizon-forbidden-west-review,"Dino crisis.Let's get one thing out of the way first: If you've enjoyed Horizon: Zero Dawn and are already looking forward to the sequel, there's likely only a very small chance you won't enjoy Forbidden West. Guerrilla Games made sure of that by giving you a game that is functionally identical to a lot of Zero Dawn. You will take on herds of machines so you can harvest them for parts. You will shoot animals for their hides. You will climb Tallnecks and rappel down. You will take out countless camps of near-identical human opponents. And, if you're anything like me, you will also take a lot of pictures - of swirling red sandstorms, snow-tipped mountains and views of sprawling forests. In truth, I can't calm down about the way Forbidden West looks. Someone made this, and you can walk around in it!All of these elements worked well before, and I expect many players to embrace Forbidden West just as they did in 2017 because of them. What I'm interested in, however, is change. Since this is a sequel, it feels fair to ask whether Forbidden West improves on elements that could have done with improving. I can recognise and appreciate that Guerrilla made attempts to address some common criticisms of the first game. However, in most cases these intended improvements don't actually improve a lot.The new map is once again a stunner. I got a lot of enjoyment from just discovering each new part of it and taking it in. I often made my own quiet moments - coming up to a star-studded sky after a night swim, or watching trees sway in a storm for a while before moving to the next objective. It's not an entirely bug-free journey at this point, but I consider most bugs I encountered to be minor and most should be fixed with the day one patch that arrived towards the end of the review period. (Side-quest progression bugs, due to an NPC not going where they're supposed to, cleared after reloading my save, and the rest of the bugs were camera or lighting-related, with music overlapping sometimes, plus some pop-in that's since been reduced by the patch.) Characters are almost always just as gorgeous as their surroundings. I especially live for the skin in this game. Aloy now has the ruddy cheeks of a perpetually pale redhead, and beautiful freckles, and I'm obsessed with the several different shades you can clearly distinguish on darker-skinned characters. There are still unnaturally moving, dead-eyed characters in sequences, likely due to not using mo-cap for everything, but even that is a lot less noticeable.As for what you do in this world, and with these characters? After a lengthy tutorial which establishes the basics, all bets are off.In short there is a discovery problem. New weapons and monsters are very often not organically introduced as part of the story, but come across as entirely optional, no matter how useful or exciting they could be to encounter as part of Aloy's adventure. This happened in the previous game, too, but now, you will often fight familiar monsters during the main quest, only to find new ones only outside of the critical path. This is a shame, particularly since the new weapons in particular are a lot of fun - bolt blasters, essentially the machine guns of the Horizon universe, are perhaps slightly overpowered, but make up for this by the slow reload times and weight, which influences Aloy's dodge. My personal favourite is the shredder disc, which functions like  a boomerang - if you manage to catch the disc twice after firing it, the third shot will explode on impact. But with Forbidden West's new elements, new potions and traps among them, comes a sense of being overwhelmed. I often went into the menu to switch outfits and weapons mid-fight despite the weapon wheel, or desperately thumbed through a large array of traps while running away from a monster. Since rarer versions of a particular weapon type don't just have improved stats but also fire different ammo, I was never comfortable with selling anything, and often stared at the screen just crunching numbers. The variety of weapons would ideally mean that players have the freedom to use whatever weapon they like best, but too many of them are expensive, or sold in unlikely places, to make that happen. I can't speak for the higher difficulties, but the fact that I just didn't need most of the new additions is part of why a lot of them felt like stuff, rather than useful new tools. Elsewhere it's the same story. You get to pick your skills from large skill trees with much better UI design now, for example, but the new skills themselves just didn't impact play for me - Forbidden West feels like a game that wants to be more than the original was, but in reality it can be played with the same skill set and items from its predecessor, and does not feel worse for it.  So why are they there? (In terms of more, more, more, however, I should mention the extensive list of accessibility features, including button layout customisation, vibration intensity settings, subtitles of different sizes and a long list of volume controls.)Food, which you can forage for and have someone make for you at a settlement, and a stash for items Aloy can no longer hold on her person, are two more new additions I didn't really know what to do with. Both are prime examples of RPG elements lifted from other games that just won't work in the context of Horizon. The world is so full of all kinds of stuff I didn't feel the need to access my stash. Usually I just didn't know what was in there, having forgotten how many times the game told me ""pouch full, sent to stash"". And, left with no easy way to check unless I wanted to travel back to a settlement and take a peek in there myself, it was easy to ignore. Granted, food may well make an impact at higher difficulty levels, but again you eventually carry so much of it that, ahead of a battle, I sat in the menu for minutes to crunch stats.Other improvements are equally troublesome. One frequent criticism of Zero Dawn were its many rather stupid human enemies. The main quest at least lowers that number, but of course you can still spend countless sidequests shooting at bandits. In Zero Dawn, I enjoyed nothing more than taking out entire camps stealthily. Granted, it was probably too easy - I could hop between tufts of tall grass, and lure half the camp to my position without anyone wondering why bodies were piling up right behind them. But in Forbidden West, I don't think enemies have become smarter - they still overwhelmingly remain standing in the same spot while you shoot at them, and tend to shoot the wall beneath you whenever you're in a slightly elevated position. But this time around, if one of them hears you, almost always all of them hear you. They can see you from what feels like miles away, and more often than not, very open level design completely forbids me from actually sneaking up on anyone, with tall grass often positioned in a way that makes it impossible to sneakily detonate blaze or acid cannisters. Additionally, any human opponent seems to be able to withstand some ten odd arrows. Monster battles meanwhile, in many ways the heart of Horizon, feel practically unchanged, probably because they worked fine the way they were. You can now fight several new types of monsters, including hippo-like Widemaws, something that looks like a coati and more dinosaur-adjacent creatures. I generally enjoy the battles and think they are exciting just due to how ferocious and big these machine animals are. But for the first time I noticed that just adding new types of monsters actually doesn't add variety to the fundamental gameplay - you still really just shoot a lot of arrows at them. For these encounters, too, the level design now just forbids some of the more tactical gameplay - in some areas I just wouldn't know where to put a tripcaster, or put a trap down without being seen.In terms of structure, Forbidden West's main quest structure is now much more geared towards visiting dungeons. I like that a lot more than visiting different cauldrons and killing everything inside (which of course you can still do) or tracking after the condescending know-it-all Sylens because otherwise you wouldn't know where to go. There is more of a clear goal to what you're doing this time around. You get coordinates to a place, navigate your way through it, fight a big monster and then get some computer bits at the end. The dungeons often look pretty cool, showcase Forbidden West's greatly improved climbing, and allow for some good indoor level design. There's much more climbing and pathfinding to do than before, and while it's never a challenge to find out where you need to go (because Aloy will tell you, as she never shuts up), I think there's a good mix here between climbing, scanning your surroundings and even swimming.A lot of what hasn't improved - or has, in places, become markedly worse - is connected to the story. Aloy travels west because she's trying to find a working copy of the sentient computer that's been running earth. Let's just sit with this sentence for a moment. Enjoying Horizon always meant accepting the inherent video game-y ridiculousness of its premise, but given how much work Guerrilla put into Horizon's world-building, I felt there was almost something akin to a balance there. It was fun to discover where things came from along with your protagonist, and the answers she found were silly but just believable enough.But that thrill of discovery is now mostly gone, and what we're left with is the story of a world that's dying because someone didn't debug it regularly. Much of Forbidden West's narrative issues are frustratingly embargoed, but know that at times it will go fully off the rails into wild, nonsensical sci-fi. Its ending is tedious and anticlimactic. Before you get there, you'll encounter some oddly pro-military cringe, oodles of ""don't ask"" logical leaps, and antagonists almost entirely devoid of personality and, strangely, screen time. Horizon Forbidden West is still evidently not a game that has anything of interest to say about its apocalypse... It's a game that exists to be looked at.In other words, Forbidden West successfully manages to undermine most of what was interesting and fun about Zero Dawn's story, because the deeper you look into things, the more you get confronted with pseudo, sci-fi fantasy stuff that even in a video game is difficult to take seriously - and oh, does it want to be taken seriously. Beyond the story, in Forbidden West Aloy herself is the real disappointment to me. She's now known as a saviour and a champion - soon even in the West, which at least provides an excuse for why everyone would ask her for help. But Saviour Aloy is also absolutely unbearable. She isn't just accepted, she's revered, and while she at least partially rejects that new status (""Varl, uh...helped""), she's also incredibly obnoxious all of a sudden. Aloy will repeatedly state what she needs to do, such as ""I need to go west, I need to go west,"" but she'll never explain to anyone why, only hinting, cryptically, at how she's the only one who can save the planet. The constantly sullen way in which Aloy says everything now becomes particularly difficult to bear at times, because she just sounds so done. That isn't a knock on Aloy's voice actress Ashly Burch, but on whatever process led to her being asked to perform this way, mumbling her way through every line and ending everything on an exhale so it sounds like a sigh. Meanwhile, Aloy's constant ""gotta go"" attitude leaves no time for other people's troubles - characters are frequently brushed off because they simply couldn't understand, but her character's urgency feels entirely fabricated when there's always time to hunt Pelicans and help a diplomat or two. Aloy recklessly endangers the people she's supposed to save, just to get her way, causing destruction and threatening murder in service of her mission, completely without remorse. This Aloy will kill you to save you, but before that she will belittle you and speak in technobabble. Granted, I did enjoy some of the multi-part sidequests, as they highlighted the day-to-day struggles of the new clans you meet - but here too, the number of recognisable characters has been greatly reduced, and the number of interesting female characters, a major part of what worked so well with Horizon Zero Dawn's storytelling, seems to have markedly and frustratingly reduced. What's more, narratively, almost the entire campaign is structurally identical. Usually some bureaucracy or another will keep Aloy from doing the thing she needs to do - like win some clan chief's trust, usually, again, by killing a lot of people - and then, only once she's done that, she can finally get her world saving done. It's a well-trodden criticism of the open world genre's storytelling issues, but a pertinent one, and one that Forbidden West does little to counter.As a woman with African roots, it was also startling to see Zulu face paint in the game being treated as a cosmetic, something you can get at a settlement for shards, as if it were fun Halloween makeup - completely removed from its cultural significance. As a result of all this, Horizon Forbidden West is still evidently not a game that has anything of interest to say about its apocalypse, brought about, essentially, by a few Silicon Valley idiots, other than ""look how pretty these holograms are"". It's a game that exists to be looked at.There are other frustrations. While Forbidden West is not a difficult game to understand, it acts like it is. Aloy will narrate your every move, and I mean every move (""I should scan this."" ""I fell off and need to find my way back up""), robbing you of all agency to discover anything for yourself. Characters will explain the same issue over and over, but feel like empty, quest-giving shells otherwise (also a frequent criticism of the first game). And again, there's the lingering sense of borrowing without meaning, without understanding the original context of what's being borrowed. To seemingly counter that issue of shallow side characters, for instance, Guerrilla once again lifts a mechanic from somewhere else - characters who accompany you for stretches of the main game and fight with you, God of War-style. I really like these people, and would give each of them their own main game over Forbidden West's Aloy immediately. They convene at a hub, Dragon Age: Inquisition-style, where you can watch them banter and ask them how it's going. This is again a good idea in practice that just doesn't, and won't, fit Forbidden West the way it does other games, as after characters arrive at the hub you don't take them with you again. They're just sitting in a large bunker, without much to say on your progress. I didn't get a lot of added value from it.It's a real shame. While it's undoubtedly another accomplished game in terms of technical achievement and sheer visual spectacle - I'm reminded again of those incredible faces, and one particularly outstanding underwater level - I've enjoyed Forbidden West less than Zero Dawn. The main story has major issues, and the level design made it difficult for me to play the way I had previously enjoyed, while making a lot of the newer systems feel redundant. Beyond that, the sense is of a game where Guerrilla has cobbled together RPG building blocks often without making them work within the context of its own game, and in some cases actively worsening Horizon Forbidden West as a result. I don't expect groundbreaking innovation, but with using well-established elements there's always the danger of them having been done better elsewhere. Unfortunately, with Horizon Forbidden West that's often the case.You're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!

The Forbidden West may have been forbidden just because it needs you so much - and I'm totally here for it.Release date: February 18, 2022
Platform(s): PS5, PS4
Developer: Guerrilla Games
Publisher: Sony It builds on what was offered by Horizon Zero Dawn - an open world filled with quests to catch your attention, a strong story of post-post-apocalyptic life, robot dinosaurs, and technological mysteries. There was almost a concern that this sequel may feel too familiar, just teleported to a new map, but the opening hours alone were enough to alleviate those fears. Although the same framework is there and the core gameplay mechanics remain untouched, this truly is an evolution, a new beast fitted over the mechanical bones of the Old Ones.Regardless of whether the next quest you find is a smaller errand or core story mission, there's a depth and breadth to each one that's consistently surprising. What you'd expect to be a simple fetch quest is always much more than that, and someone you initially think is an incidental character becomes a recurring favorite you're desperate to see pop up again elsewhere. That's key to the experiences in the Forbidden West as the most immediate change is the improvements to the humans you'll find in this robotic world. While there were a handful of memorable characters in the original game, developer Guerrilla has made every single person you interact with in the sequel feel unique and interesting. Regardless of the time you spend with any NPC, each one has a distinct personality, a slither of backstory, and an interesting hook. There's a beautiful array of diversity here too, including non-binary representation and characters with disabilities, which is an interesting conversation to be had in a tribalistic world. The little touches make a difference too, like seeing anyone in the desert areas visibly glisten with sweat; while possibly the best facial capture in games to date allows for every look and smirk to come to life. There's a lot more humor and humanity on show here and it all aids how connected you feel to the world and its people in Horizon Forbidden West. Even the returning gameplay elements have had more personality injected into their metallic joints. Tallnecks return as a means of unfogging the gigantic map, with the huge giraffe-esque beasts dotted at different points around the Forbidden West. The original game's gimmick was just working out how to get to their heads in order to hack their geographical knowledge. But, this time around each of the majestic creatures gets its own little narrative quirk. Cauldrons too, the ancient robot manufacturing plants that you have to hack to gain the ability to take control of the dinos, all require a different approach. Dyes and face paints can be unlocked to customize Aloy further, while more machines can be overridden and commandeered than ever before. It helps to diversify your approach to combat too. Regardless of how powerful you get as Aloy - who's conveniently got into some ""trouble"" between games to explain the loss of all her advanced weaponry and power armor - the robot dinosaurs will always be king here. One bad move can be fatal against the toughest opponents, like the gigantic mammoth-inspired Tremortusks that have dominated the trailers for the game. Your only way of effectively taking them down is to plan, strategize, and make sure you've prepped, along with moving and attacking with as much caution as you can before the inevitable chaos quite literally reigns down on you. I love the fact that taking down the biggest machines is always a challenge; there's a difficulty curve at play that you never quite crest the top of. But it ensures that taking them down never feels anything but rewarding. Although the game does do a poor job of explaining some of the intricacies of its systems - particularly when it comes to the different ammo types, firing options, and the way to benefit best from its pretty complex skill tree. The new Valor system, which gives Aloy huge buffs and boosts to use in combat that can be switched out at will, is a welcome addition that always delights with its little cutscene triggers and liberal use of war paint. But, anyone who hasn't played the original game could well find themselves lost in the weaponry sub-systems. Another frustration is the climbing. It was said that the game offers 'free-climbing' with no limitations on where you can shimmy on up, but in reality, climbing is limited to secret handholds that you expose with a pulse of your focus. There's no consistency to where and when you can climb, and the button prompts to leap from handhold to handhold are clumsy and awkward. Accidentally flinging myself from the side of a skyscraper became a regular occurrence, with the movement occasionally becoming frustrating to the point of utter irritation. It's certainly not a patch on the smoothness of scaling the world that you'll find in something like Assassin's Creed: Valhalla and that's such a shame when the world continually urges you to explore it. What always works though is how rewarding exploration feels. Like all of the best open-world games, there's always something to discover around the next horizon, with some areas locked off until you've obtained the right skill. There's always the subtle encouragement to revisit earlier areas to discover what you've missed, and because of the strength of the game's side quests and other narrative beats, you won't want to miss a single thing. The addition of swimming adds enhanced depth to the world, although it does come complete with its own dangers, and when the climbing does work it all blends to make you feel like you can go anywhere. At the center of it all is Aloy. Our returning heroine is just as compelling here as in the original game, if not more so because some of the struggles she has to overcome feel much more relatable this time around. The first game saw her as an outcast growing from child to young woman, just trying to find out where she came from. The discoveries she makes of Elisabeth Sobeck and the activities of the old ones become her driving force. But here, she's already armed with so much knowledge that it's the more human-level arc that really drives the story forward. Of course, there's a world to be fixed and big bads to be vanquished, but it's as much about fixing the world as it is about Aloy learning that the people of Earth are just as much worth saving as the planet itself. The journey she takes from being staunchly, almost repugnantly independent, to embracing the friends - old and new - that push their way into her life is quite unforgettable. More than once I found myself laughing out loud or fighting back a tear or two. What you end up with is a cast that both myself and Aloy would die for, which is complemented by the other adventures you've had along the way to saving the world. So compelling are they that you may well feel compelled to avoid the main story for fear of it all ending too quickly. I adore the more subtle developments too, like hearing the way the inhabitants of the Forbidden West react to Aloy's presence changes. Known initially by many names throughout the land, like Red, Savior of Meridian, and flame-haired, eventually you'll notice that her insistence at being called ""just Aloy"" starts to stick. It's a world you want to spend time in, and like Aloy, will want to protect at all costs. And did I mention that it's utterly stunning too? This is the first massive PS5 open world and the variation you'll find here will always have you reaching for the screenshot button. The neon lights of Las Vegas, the withering remains of San Francisco, the warning glow of a robot searching for you through the underwater reeds, it looks and feels magnificent to play. What Guerrilla Games has achieved here is nothing short of phenomenal. Story, gameplay, mechanics, and the world itself are all such an improvement on the original game - which in itself is a feat alone. The climbing, ironically, is the only thing that really holds it back from utter perfection, but it's not enough to make Aloy's latest story go without anything bar the highest recommendation. You know a game is good when the robot dinosaurs aren't the thing you want to talk to your friends about first. Sam Loveridge is the Global Editor-in-Chief of GamesRadar, and joined the team in August 2017.

Horizon Forbidden West,Kimberley Wallace,Game Informer,https://www.gameinformer.com/review/horizon-forbidden-west/horizon-forbidden-west-review-leaping-to-greater-heights,"Horizon Zero Dawn was just the introduction to Guerrilla Games’ fascinating world and the unlikely hero who would do everything in her power to save it. The sequel, Horizon Forbidden West, takes everything to an exciting new level with its novel mechanics and riveting lore. Guerrilla Games improves on the last game’s shortcomings and isn’t afraid to borrow popular features from other big-name series, like Uncharted, Mass Effect, and Assassin’s Creed. The result is a game that’s not only fun to play, but full of surprises and wonder. Zero Dawn was a great proof of concept, but Forbidden West shows Guerrilla Games still has plenty of thought-provoking and compelling places to take Aloy’s adventures.Forbidden West picks up six months after the events of Zero Dawn. Aloy’s discoveries have only brought more questions and dangers her way, forcing her to head west for answers. With a few returning characters and plot tie-ins from the first game, Forbidden West isn’t ideal for newcomers who want to embrace the narrative. Guerrilla’s writers expertly expand upon Horizon’s rich lore and dive into the series’ sci-fi elements, which are the sequel’s most gripping aspects. Some of the most fun I had was piecing together Aloy’s journey, but certain revelations and “ah ha” moments aren’t as satisfying without the full context from the first game. The overall narrative kept me engaged, but certain parts feel rushed, and I was disappointed that villainous characters like Regalla are not given more time to shine.In the last entry, Aloy’s journey was often solitary, but Forbidden West makes other characters central to her success, which is a nice change of pace. Returning faces like Varl and Erend get to show more of their personalities, and newcomers like the kindhearted Zo and tragic warrior Kotallo have interesting backstories that explain their tribes’ beliefs and values. To make these burgeoning relationships more authentic, Aloy establishes a home base, a la Mass Effect, where she can talk to her companions about new developments in the main quest, learn their thoughts about one another, and get to know them more on a personal level. I loved watching the base populate with new members and seeing new areas open within it. If anything, I wanted more time to hang out with the characters. It was that fun to be around them and listen to their banter. The world is the star of the show. Forbidden West is a technical marvel, with breathtaking vistas, vibrant underwater corridors, and lush jungles. Every locale has its own flavor; just wait until you see Las Vegas. Traversal has been greatly improved, with smoother climbing mechanics and a new tool called the Shield Wing, which acts almost like a futuristic umbrella to let you descend from great heights. However, the world’s constant sense of discovery really had me glued to my controller. Forbidden West is a much bigger game than its predecessor, featuring an impressive number of quests and items to uncover. The story-focused side quests add so much to the lore that I never wanted to miss one, as they provided great insight into the tribes. One side quest forced me to pick between two imperfect characters vying to lead a tribe, while another had me battling the most vicious combination of machines flying on top of a Sunhawk.The side content also allowed me to unlock new locales and dungeons, and this doesn’t even factor in the additional activities like clearing rebel camps, climbing Tallnecks to reveal more of the map, and exploring Cauldrons for new machine overrides. I wasn’t expecting such a dense and vast world, and I always felt like I had something to do. Side quests offer great rewards, making them worth your while – some of my best weapons and armor came from these pursuits. I especially enjoyed revisiting settlements to see how some of the environments and their residents changed due to my actions. And as a nice touch, even more side quests would open regularly.Battles are still adrenaline-pumping affairs, and the satisfaction of besting monstrous machines never dissipates. You can expect more destructibility and bigger setpieces for fights, and I loved how the variety in the locales, from fighting in close quarters to rocky areas with plenty of places for cover, kept things fresh with new strategies to consider. Forbidden West allows you to embrace your own playstyle, offering many ways to get the upper hand on machines. This has its advantages and disadvantages. I loved the creativity at my disposal, like shooting weapons off machines and using them against the enemy or causing chain reactions with specific elements to cause big explosions. But at the same time, I never felt a growing sense of power that keeps combat interesting over time, and a lot of this comes down to my disappointment in the skill trees.The abilities you learn via the skill trees feel more like tiny perks than exciting upgrades. For instance, you can unlock the ability to set up traps faster, more potent potions, and extra ranged damage alongside weapon techniques that do anything from guaranteeing a knockdown shot to increased shredder damage. The best addition to the skill trees is Valor Surges, which are special attacks you tactfully unleash. I wish there were more of these abilities to experiment with, because once I unlocked and fully upgraded the radial blast, which triggers a powerful AoE shockwave, I never found another that felt as valuable. Some others include dealing more damage with melee attacks for a limited time and a damage-absorbing energy shield. That being said, the skill trees were so inconsequential to my success that I let my skill points pile upward of 10 without even touching them.Thankfully, the game is full of worthwhile improvements that make for a better experience, from a cleaner HUD to less inventory management. My favorite enhancements were being able to use Aloy’s focus to see climbing points and her ability to tag specific machine parts in a different color for easier targeting. The latter comes in handy for key upgrade resources, as certain machine components are crucial to upgrade your armor and weapons. Upgrades are a greater time investment as a result, and I grew tired of fighting the same machines repeatedly. As far as performance, I ran into a few minor glitches alongside some poor A.I. pathing and bad checkpoints, but none of these were significant issues that caused me much frustration. I was actually impressed by how smooth the game played considering its size and scope.Horizon Forbidden West reaches a new high bar for Guerrilla Games. It does more than surpass its predecessor; it takes Horizon’s fiction to captivating places and builds a rich world that rewards you for the effort you put into it. Mostly, it’s an entertaining experience, complete with jaw-dropping moments and unforgettable fights.

Horizon Forbidden West,Nicole Clark,Polygon,https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22929940/horizon-forbidden-west-review-ps5-ps4,"Filed under:Returning to Aloy’s machine-threatened world is well worth the wait I still remember the moment when Horizon Zero Dawn opened up past Nora territory, and I took my first steps into the vast wilderness. I went slack-jawed as I roamed red rock plateaus, admiring the topographical fidelity to the natural world. All of it was filled with robotic foes, which I fought with just bows, arrows, and a spear. I played every quest, completed every Hunting Ground; I got the Shield Weaver armor, and collected most of the metal flowers; I played through the Frozen Wilds expansion. Three years later, I went on a road trip through Utah and Colorado, to see this part of America myself.Horizon Forbidden West has delivered on the promise of more on just about every level. It’s a buffet you might graze on forever, filled with quests, characters, encampments, environments, and collectibles — and battles against new deadly machines. The game’s many expanded traversal tools and combat options deeply enrich the time you spend in this gorgeous, nearly photo-real wilderness. But Forbidden West also stumbles over this “more is better” ethos. Both mechanically and narratively, it suffers under the weight of its sequel ambitions, trying too hard to be grand, and sometimes losing sight of its strong world-building and storytelling heart. That said, Aloy is still a character I love, and her world is one I enjoyed spending time in — and one I plan to explore indefinitely.Horizon Forbidden West, especially on the PlayStation 5, is breathtaking; it’s one of the most impressively realized wilderness games I’ve ever played. On PS5, you can regularly walk from interiors right into the wide world, without loading screens. This gives players incredible freedom in their journey westward, exploring gorgeous vistas bursting with giant sequoias, expansive lakes, and crumbling ruins swallowed by desert sands. Joshua trees and scrub-speckled flatlands give an immediate sense of place — and Forbidden West even lets players explore decaying ruins of actual American cities. These landmarks punctuate Forbidden West’s story about climate crises and the excesses of the ruling class. Though the last game ended with a battle against the rampant AI Hades, humanity’s victory did not repair the lethal machines that were originally part of a terraforming project meant to save the Earth. The off-kilter system has created unstable weather patterns, blighted farmlands, and polluted waterways — and Guerrilla Games’ overgrown rendition of the West Coast is a plausible projection of our real-world climate degradation.Aloy’s expanded traversal tools, while flawed, greatly aid the player in exploring this world. The developers took obvious cues from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, adding a glider to Aloy’s toolkit and more handholds for her to climb on. In Forbidden West, Aloy can scale mountains, the peaks of which offer grand rewards: a gorgeous view, a height advantage against enemies, and the opportunity to glide over ravines and rolling pastures alike. Swimming is also a singular joy, once you’ve unlocked a tool that allows for infinite underwater breathing. I’ve spent hours watching swimming machines, and exploring the richness of marine life clinging to crumbling buildings. With Forbidden West’s better fast travel system — it’s free to travel between discovered campfires, while traveling from anywhere to a campfire costs one fast travel pack — this all weaves into a rich exploration experience, whether you’re fast-traveling or running from place to place, enjoying the abundance of the world around you.In Horizon Forbidden West, I’m constantly switching between the 60 fps and 4K graphics modesBut despite the creativity of Aloy’s new traversal tools, their uneven execution dampens some of the fun. Handholds are often not marked — by default, you pulse your Focus to reveal them — and not all surfaces are climbable, which can be frustrating. It’s especially difficult when navigating enclosed spaces, and when the margin for error is slim; a fall means repeating an entire platforming sequence. Early swimming challenges are often disorienting, with hard-to-see visual cues. The grappling hook is full of potential, but it’s mostly used to dislodge vent covers, and often requires players to time jumps perfectly. In a game so obsessed with the joy of exploration, it’s all the more heartbreaking to adhere to environmental puzzles’ single-track solutions.When freed from the confines of caves and laboratories, Forbidden West thrives — especially when Aloy flexes her skills as a hunter. New machines are fearsome and deadly, and a treat to fight or override: There are giant boars and rattlesnakes, as well as terrifying mammoths and Triceratops-esque robots. As in Zero Dawn, taking them down requires scanning for weak points and removing crucial components. In keeping with its expanded navigation tools, Forbidden West also introduces new weapons and traps. Collecting an arsenal of sharpshot bows gave me more freedom to develop a sniper strategy around tearing off canisters, then taking down beasts with acid, flame, or frost. The game also largely scraps the rote human-enemy fights of Zero Dawn. A rebel faction has learned to override machines, and fighting humans atop the backs of Chargers requires rethinking stealth strategies entirely.However, the game doesn’t do a great job of teaching takedown tactics. Zero Dawn walked players through using a Thunderjaw’s disc launcher against it, while Forbidden West cues players to fire elemental arrows and try traps, without offering a more cohesive combat strategy for larger, scarier enemies. This can make such machines, like the aforementioned mammoths, feel like a confounding spike in difficulty.Forbidden West’s struggle to teach the finer points of combat might just be because there are so many ways to fight. Players who aren’t so keen on stealth have more options now — for example, expanded melee combos make the spear much more viable. There are six perk trees, with a wealth of unlockable skills (thankfully, some of Aloy’s best skills from Zero Dawn, like Silent Strike, are defaults in Forbidden West). But it can all feel like a deluge. These skill trees are detailed, and even include a new special attack called a Valor Surge. This is in line with the broader abundance of additional options, from bows to armor to cooked meals to the game’s new crafting tables.This is all to say that Forbidden West gives players a lot to play with — and it’s easy to lose sight of the bigger picture, even as the story keeps raising the stakes about Earth’s predicament. Still, it wasn’t what I focused on. Forbidden West told me that Aloy had limited time to save the planet from famine. But I screwed around hunting wild machines, and wasted an hour shooting some 20 lizards to get their “wild meat” for an upgrade to my quiver. I made time to replace an overworked cook’s favorite griddle, and to deliver a flower to a “forbidden” lover. I did melee pit challenges, went on errands, fought through cauldrons, and picked apart rebel outposts. I involved myself deeply in the concerns of my fellow people, and gained companions that altered my perception of this beautiful world. My attachment to these comrades led me to other settlements, full of specific concerns like labor disputes and simple personal spats, along with the ever-present machine threat. Forbidden West hits its stride when Aloy is engaging with settlements and tribal communities, and investing in her companion characters. These aren’t story quests I had to play along Aloy’s journey — but they’re the ones I chose to anyway. The companions aren’t very useful in a fight, but that didn’t make me love them any less. They’re vital in a game where you’re a hero who has to save the world. These relationships convey a world worth saving, far more than the main storyline really does.At the same time, Forbidden West continues the series’ depiction of a post-racial society, while also borrowing aesthetics from various cultures — Zero Dawn received fair criticism for appropriating Indigenous cultures in its tribal designs, as well as using the term “Braves.” (In Zero Dawn, you learn that the AI function Apollo, which contained records of human history, was destroyed. This ostensibly allows the world to start fresh, free of the racism of the present day.) While the racial diversity of the Horizon games feels like progress in the context of AAA games more broadly, it’s at odds with how race, ethnicity, and culture are borrowed here without being discussed, or even acknowledged. I may have missed audio logs or journal entries that explain these issues, but that reinforces the idea that they aren’t core to the story. In the end, this is Aloy’s story: She continues to be a headstrong protagonist, and I say that admiringly. In Forbidden West, she takes no shit — but she also learns valuable lessons about accepting help, and about acknowledging the grief that comes from growing up as an outcast. She goes to bat for the people she cares about. Forbidden West homes in on the contrast between her convictions and those of Dr. Elisabet Sobeck, the creator of the Zero Dawn project that set the whole series in motion, and the character from whom Aloy was cloned. Where Sobeck took the destruction of humanity as an assumption, and worked to repopulate the Earth, Aloy fights for the survival of those who are alive today. Even as the story throws in twists and additional characters that alter the scope of the threat she’s up against, her steadfast resolve remains. Getting to play as her — in such a beautiful and densely packed world — is a journey I won’t walk away from anytime soon.

Horizon Forbidden West,Ari Notis,Kotaku,https://kotaku.com/horizon-forbidden-west-the-kotaku-review-1848524470,"For a game about exploring the unknown, Horizon Forbidden West sure plays it safe.Horizon Forbidden West follows directly in the path etched by its predecessor, 2017’s Horizon Zero Dawn. It’s an open-world role-playing game set a thousand years from now, in a version of America covered in rust, rubble, and robot dinosaurs. On your adventures, you clear dozens of bandit outposts, open hundreds of treasure chests, craft yourself an armory of battle-ready gear, and assist various folks who need assistance in various ways. You do all this as a young woman named Aloy (voiced by Ashly Burch), whose impeccable archery skills form the foundation of the action. You’ve done this all before.Make no mistake: Despite its comfortably familiar trappings, Horizon Forbidden West is a tour de force. Its sprawling world feels alive with a tangible vigor many open-world games can only dream of. Not since The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt have I played side-quests as invariably engrossing as these. In moments of downtime, Forbidden West features a fully optional tactical mini-game that’s so captivating I almost had to ask for an extension on this review because I kept getting side-tracked (we’ll get to that). In the busier moments, the core offerings—running, jumping, climbing, gawking slack-jawed at giant robot dinosaurs, then shooting those robot dinosaurs with an inventive arsenal of bows and arrows—are a blast from tip to tail.It’s a technological marvel to boot, too. In every frame, Horizon Forbidden West is a delectable feast for the eyes, at least on PlayStation 5, unseating last year’s Xbox racer Forza Horizon 5 as the best-looking console game in the neverending arms race of graphical fidelity. Pre-release coverage restrictions (Sony provided Kotaku with a PS5 copy of Horizon Forbidden West under condition of embargo) limit us to publishing 20 screenshots before launch. I’ll be frank, a small part of me wanted to just publish a post headlined “Here Are 20 Screenshots Of Horizon Forbidden West” and call it a day. This game is that beautiful—and, yes, for all you digital photogs, there’s a robust photo mode you can avail yourself of at any moment.But it’s hard not to feel a twinge of disillusionment amid the splendor, much like the diminishing thrills you get when vacationing in the same place for a return trip. Horizon Zero Dawn was a revelation. Horizon Forbidden West is a refinement.Horizon Forbidden West picks up several months after the events of Zero Dawn. Turns out, the big bad of that game—a malevolent artificial intelligence program known as HADES—wasn’t quite as defeated as Aloy was led to believe, but was exactly as undefeated as players were led to believe via Zero Dawn’s post-credits stinger. Also: the world is probably gonna end as a result. On word from her kinda-friend-kinda-not Sylens (Lance Reddick, who delivers all of his lines…like so), the solution to Aloy’s dilemma lies westward, past the confines of the charted world. So that’s where she goes.Key to this western realm, and to Forbidden West’s multi-plotline story, is a factionalized nation known as the Tenakth. The Tenakth maintain a tenuous peace with the principalities of the first game: the Carja, the Oseram, and so on. But their leader, Hekarro, is grappling with a rebellion spearheaded by his former lieutenant, Regalla (the inimitable Angela Bassett), which threatens that peace.Following her heroics in Zero Dawn, Aloy has attained a sort of messiah-like status, which allows her to do pretty much whatever she wants and go pretty much wherever she wants to go. People treat her with reverent awe and acquiesce to her requests, praising her as the “savior.” One major city centers a prominent district around a statue of Aloy carved from gold. (“The sculptor wanted to go even bigger,” one character remarks.) But Aloy doesn’t have the time nor the patience for any of that. She just wants to save the world.Alas, there is one place Aloy can’t just wander into unfettered: the west. You see, the west is, as the game’s title so aptly describes, forbidden (oh-ho!). The Tenakth keep a tight border; the only way Aloy is allowed to travel their lands is by attending a summit between east and west. Her first real task, simply, is to ensure the summit goes off without a hitch.Throughout Forbidden West, characters comment on Aloy’s seemingly divine prowess. Little do they know, her “second sight” abilities are a result of how, as a child, she happened to find a wearable device from the old world called a Focus, which renders augmented reality overlays on the world, revealing a cascade of unseen information in neon light. In the early moments of Forbidden West, Aloy clues other characters into the verboten knowledge of the Focus, even providing versions of the device to her friends.Sequels to open-world games tend to lean on a trope: They typically kick off with some disaster or other narrative mishap stripping the main character of all the powers and gear you painstakingly earned in the first game. That’s not the case for Horizon Forbidden West’s Aloy, who maintains much of her prowess, right down to certain skills—like the ability to slow down time while aiming her bow—being available from the start.This allows Horizon Forbidden West a unique opportunity. Instead of some trite sequence in which, for your benefit, she “learns” how to control a device she’s had years to master, Aloy walks her longtime friend Varl (John Macmillan)—and thus the player—through its quirks and functions. It’s a neat spin on the tired “you lost all your stuff” formula and forced tutorials that don’t make any narrative sense, for sure. But it’s nothing quite as groundbreaking as the highwater marks of its forebear.It is perhaps unfair to measure Horizon Forbidden West against the lofty expectations established by Zero Dawn. Let’s rewind for a second to the 2010s, a not-exactly-halcyon era that saw the big studios of the world caught up in a cycle of sequels and threequels and prequels. Here we had a brand-new series from a studio (Guerrilla Games) best known—and perhaps written off by some—for a quintessentially generic series of sci-fi shooters known as Killzone. But this new game…man, it wasn’t just good. With its distinct action and unforgettable enemies, it was phenomenal, setting a standard for what an ambitious big-budget video game could accomplish. How fun! How fresh! How pleasantly unexpected.From the jump, Horizon Forbidden West could never pull off the same hat trick. Its biggest gimmick—that it uses fossilized behemoths from the Mesozoic as blueprints for artificially intelligent war machines—isn’t a novelty that can be replicated. You know how it goes: You see one robot T. Rex, you’ve seen ‘em all.To compensate for a lack of what experts call “holy shit!”-ness, Horizon Forbidden West distracts by throwing more at you—more giant robot dinosaurs, more Hollywood A-listers, more lens flare, more skill trees and upgrade materials and weapon variations and categories of optional activities, more, more, more, more, more.Fundamental systems that worked, like Zero Dawn’s peerless bow-shooting and unique approach to clearing a massive map’s fog of war (you climb a robot brachiosaurus), have been expanded. A slew of imaginative new weapons—explosive javelins, rapid-fire bows—join reimagined versions of the classics. Where “ropecaster” bows were once strictly used to tie down finicky enemies, now you can also use them to attach explosive canisters to machines. Where “tripcaster” bows were once strictly used to place traps on the battlefield, now you can also use them to generate handy shield walls.The systems that didn’t work have been overhauled to the extent that they now do. Take, for instance, Zero Dawn’s climbing “puzzles,” which seemed like nothing more than a taped-on afterthought in 2017. Now, in part thanks to a nifty grappling hook and a straight-out-of-BotW hang glider, scaling cliffs and crumbled buildings is consistently engaging. (The obvious lesson: Put grappling hooks and hang gliders in every game.) Routes sprawl outward in branching, often head-scratching mazes. Whatever mechanical tweaks Guerrilla adjusted under the hood, you always feel in full control of where Aloy moves her limbs, too. The result is a recurrent mechanic akin to something out of Naughty Dog’s hit series of Uncharted adventure games—right down to that studio’s infamous “Hey this handhold seems like it’ll ho- ohhhh crap!” feature. What a welcome improvement.If this all sounds like I’m preoccupied with considering Forbidden West in the incandescent light of its predecessor, well, that’s because the game itself openly invites such comparison. It’s almost imperative that you play the first one (or at least read through a fan wiki from cover to cover). A “previously on” narration calls out key plot points yet doesn’t elucidate the emotional anchors that steady those points. Characters mention past events devoid of any contextual framing. And while this all contributes to a natural conversational cadence in cutscenes, to the sense that you’re stepping into a world as real as ours—one in which people talk like people rather than characters who have to awkwardly shoehorn exposition into their interactions—it can get confusing at times. Indeed, despite having played Zero Dawn twice, I had to refer to one of those fan wikis several times throughout my 50-odd hours with Forbidden West, just to understand WTF people were talking about.What’s more, Horizon Forbidden West doesn’t entirely wash itself of the sins of its past. In 2017, around the release of Zero Dawn, critic Dia Lacina pointed out how the game mishandled indigenous culture in a barnburner essay for Mic (originally published on Medium). Specifically, Lacina called out how Zero Dawn flagrantly tossed around phrases like “braves” and “savages” without including any deeper examination of said phrases, nor the historical weight behind them. The ensuing conversation spurred a response from Guerrilla; narrative director John Gonzalez told Vice the studio was “not intentionally being insensitive, or [meaning] to offend in any manner.”I don’t for a second profess to speak for people of indigenous descent, though I will note that I certainly ran into some eyebrow-raising moments over the course of Forbidden West. To be clear, I never heard the words “braves” or “savages,” which suggests Guerrilla is listening and has taken feedback from half a decade ago to heart. That said, unless an explanation totally passed me by, Forbidden West never addresses why many characters wear outfits reminiscent of traditional Native American clothing, a point of contention for some in the wake of Zero Dawn. All that “savior” stuff? Given that Aloy is white, and that so many characters in Horizon—in roles both crucial and secondary—are people of color, yeah, it’s weird! Due to those aforementioned embargo restrictions, which are so extensive as to bar me from mentioning a character who is literally in one of the trailers, I can’t get into detail here, but the entire final act—the denouement in particular—smacks of colonialist overtones, all in service of little more than sci-fi grandeur. In the coming days and weeks, as players approach and then complete the endgame, it’ll be a conversation to watch.It’s a shame, too, as Horizon Forbidden West’s first and second acts tee up intriguing mysteries that raise thematic issues such as the evils of colonization and the lengths to which obscenely wealthy people will go to shape the planet in their image. The game could have spent its conclusion confronting these topics head on, daring to use its post-apocalyptic world to say something meaningful about ours. But instead, it veers right into the potholes so many big-budget productions veer into, emphasizing twists for the sake of surprising the audience, expanding the fiction for the sake of beefing up the lore bibles, and, ultimately, raising the stakes to comical heights for no immediately apparent purpose beyond keeping the franchise engine roaring.Five years ago, Horizon Zero Dawn stood out among the crowd by openly challenging what we’d fairly come to expect from the insatiable serialization machine. Horizon Forbidden West has succumbed to the same machine.Where Horizon Forbidden West’s main quest falters, it’s propped up by a fount of truly excellent optional stuff. If you’re not stumbling upon a short story with surprising emotional heft, you’re battling a machine variant not seen in the main campaign, or uncovering some new way to play the game. One seemingly tedious early quest—in which you’re tasked with rescuing miners trapped in a waterlogged mine—contains the first tutorial for underwater swimming, an essential aspect of Forbidden West. (Worth it.) Scaling giant robodinos (called tallnecks) to defog the map isn’t just a matter of navigating hand- and footholds: each one also requires you to complete a bespoke and often entertaining side-quest. In one memorable sequence, I sat slack-jawed while battling my way through an abandoned treehouse city woven into a canopy of redwoods, just to get the necessary height to clamber aboard that region’s tallneck.After 50-odd hours, I’ve hit the credits with dozens of optional activities left unfinished, and I fully plan on checking out as many as I can in the coming weeks.These side-quests are enriched by Forbidden West’s stellar acting and frighteningly realistic facial capture tech. In a lovely touch, one I don’t think I’ve ever seen so aptly captured in a video game, characters don’t always maintain eye contact, often breaking it in the middle of conversation, looking off into the distance or down at their feet. Eye contact is hard! Real people don’t maintain it for every second of every conversation; we’re not BioWare dialogue trees.Horizon Forbidden West neatly organizes its library of secondary activities with a near foolproof set of submenus. Side-quests officially marked as side-quests are the meaty ones, the ones with fascinating narrative or mechanical twists. Errands, meanwhile, consist of the one-act stuff—standard fare like hunts and fetch quests. But even some errands offer up unique scenarios. (One notable errand had me quietly tail a robot triceratops and pluck flowers out of its, um, waste without getting noticed.) There are further categories for everything else, from combat challenges to platforming gauntlets to environmental puzzles tucked away in the world’s dustiest corners. By categorization alone, you can instantly tell the degree of depth you’ll find and commitment you’ll need for each activity, a design choice that more developers of open-world games should copy.But behind every small convenience hides a slightly less-small inconvenience, showing how the Horizon series—yeah, it’s a series now—has failed to keep pace with advancements made by open-world game design over the past half a decade.After you commandeer a dino-robot for use as a mount, you can call it to your side at any moment, but you can’t bring it into any settlements—a minor annoyance made particularly conspicuous when you visit a settlement arranged along a very narrow mountain pass. You leave your mount at one end, then call it to you again…a whole two seconds later. How’d you get here, buddy?When allies fall in battle, you can revive them, or they’ll automatically revive after about 30 seconds or so. Great! But when it comes time to follow those allies for a quest, you’ll have to slow down to match their speed. Less great…If you approach an environmental puzzle you can’t yet solve due to lacking a piece of gear, Aloy will openly remark how she doesn’t seem to have the necessary equipment, saving you from wasting time learning that yourself the hard way. Actually, hmm, no drawback to that one—it’s simply fantastic.There are dozens if not hundreds of fast-travel points, designated as campfires. The catch? You can only initiate travel when you’re at one of those campfires, unless you want to burn hard-earned shards (Horizon’s in-game currency).The autosave is forgiving, but if you want to manually save (c’mon, who here has full trust in the autosave?), you can only do it at one of these campfires.Then there’s the stash, one of Forbidden West’s most singularly accommodating features. When you loot a resource your pack is already full of, it’ll automatically go into your stash, which shows up at any of the game’s bazillion outposts and, in my experience, has limitless space. But while you’re exploring, you still have to stop in your tracks to pick stuff up; you can’t snag some flowers while sprinting through a field, à la Ghost of Tsushima.It’s a bummer that Horizon Forbidden West doesn’t make looting as seamless as possible, because the game is designed to have you loot everything. While exploring, you’ll nab ridgewood, fiberzest, vigorstem, bitter leaf, sourflame, medicinal berries, and crunchy spikestalks from a sea of vegetation. Off the metal skeletons of machines, you’ll get tusks, nerves, cores, coils, blaze, sparkers, circulators, stickpaste, blastpaste, glowblast, chillwater, purgewater, metalbite, crystal braiding, volatile sludge, machine hearts, machine muscle, machine minds. In chests and sunken caches, you’ll find relics from the old world, sellable trinkets like chimes (car keys) or jewelry (a smartwatch). All of those are real items from the game, by the way, save for one I totally made up. (See if you can’t guess.)These are essential not just for crafting various traps and tools but also for participating in Horizon Forbidden West’s economy. Want to buy a “pulverizing spike thrower”? Well, you’ll need 1,062 shards, a sunwing circulator, and a large machine core. Want to upgrade its efficacy? Okay, now you need 127 shards, four braided wires, four small machine cores, and one medium machine core. For the next level, and for the one after that, you’ll need a wholly different set of loot. These requirements are distinct for every piece of gear in the game.That’s not all. If you want to increase your carrying capacity, you’ll have to hunt non-machine creatures—actual animals—for hides, bones, feathers, and such, an act that gets real old, real fast. I’m not just saying this because the whimper a fox makes when it dies sounds a lot like the noise my cat makes when he’s hungry. (Okay, I’m kinda saying this because the whimper a fox makes when it dies sounds a lot like the noise my cat makes when he’s hungry.) It all feels like a tedious vestige from a prior era of gaming. Just let me spend my shards on a bigger quiver!All of your gear—whether it’s a long-range “sharpshot” bow or a snazzy armor set with perks that fit your playstyle—has a distinct array of stats, correlating positive or negative defense ratings for a litany of elemental damage types. You can tweak your equipment with “coils,” or augmentations, applying minor stat bonuses. Every enemy, too, is resistant to certain elements and weak to others, info you can pick up by highlighting them with Aloy’s Focus device.Zero Dawn set itself apart from its contemporaries by encouraging a thoughtful, tactical approach to combat, something that remains present in Forbidden West. You might be several levels over par, you might be playing on the standard difficulty tier, and you could still get stomped by a robot velociraptor if you’re not careful. Battles play out smoothest if you hammer out a plan of attack beforehand—marking enemy walking routes and laying traps and crafting the most effective ammo—so it behooves you to quietly assess combat scenarios from the sidelines and tailor your loadouts before jumping into the fray. But we all know how plans go, and sometimes you need to quickly break out the big bows. Whatever the case, your odds are best if you have a wide array of fully leveled-up equipment.I’m sure some people will salivate over all this potential fine-tuning; that sound you hear is the dulcet chorus of a thousand Google Sheets being opened and primed around the world. Me? I unlocked a skill that essentially turned one of Aloy’s bows into a rocket launcher and stopped obsessing about that stuff. If I had the loot necessary to complete an upgrade or buy a snazzy set of armor, cool! If not, well, so be it. I had rockets.Nothing in Horizon Forbidden West sunk its claws in me more than a mini-game. I’m not sure when exactly this trend truly took off—I blame The Witcher 3’s “Gwent”—but every expansive open-world RPG these days apparently has to feature an in-universe board game of some sort. Horizon Forbidden West’s take is a turn-based tactics game called “Machine Strike.”Matches of “Machine Strike” play out on a square grid-based board. You and an opponent each have a set number of pieces, all based on the machines you fight against in the “real” game. Your goal isn’t to wipe out all of your opponent’s pieces. See, every piece is allotted a number of points. Taking an opponent’s piece out will award you that many points; similarly, if you lose a piece, your opponent will earn however many points it was worth. Your goal is to hit seven points before your opponent does.You’re given 10 points to customize a set of pieces. Stronger pieces, which have higher attack and HP values, are typically worth more points. So it becomes a measure of risk-versus-reward. Do you stack your set with low-value, low-power pieces? Or do you choose just a couple of strong ones?The board itself is a strategic landmine. Tiles can appear as one of six terrain types, which alter a piece’s stats, sometimes providing bonus effects or debuffs. Plus, every piece—just like the machines they’re based on—has strengths and weaknesses. Attack one from the side and you may deal extra damage. Attack another from the same vantage, however, and you might hit armored sides, nullifying some of your damage.I cannot possibly emphasize this enough: “Machine Strike” on its lonesome might already be my favorite game of the year. (I’m a huge sucker for good tactics.) Were I not on a tight deadline to complete Horizon Forbidden West, I’d have sought out every single “Machine Strike” player.Oh, yes, “Machine Strike” isn’t just something you access via menus. Most towns, cities, and settlements are home to an NPC who plays the game. Defeat them on three boards and they’ll award you with a piece, which you can use to further customize your sets, helping you defeat tougher players in other towns. One afternoon, I found myself wholly ignoring my more pressing quest log and, instead, charted a course from Plainsong to Scalding Spear through Fall’s Edge and Thornmarsh—yes, the city names are amazing—just to seek out more “Machine Strike” players.It’s one small touch that makes Horizon Forbidden West’s settlements more than mere pit stops for resupplying. These cities aren’t real places, but sometimes feel like they are. Despite playing a major role in the game’s marketing, San Francisco plays a disappointingly minor role in Forbidden West’s overarching story, not even showing up (for me at least) until the 25-hour mark. Instead, you spend much of your time bouncing between truly visionary locales: a bustling post-apocalyptic metropolis built around a crashed cargo plane in the Nevada desert; a driftwood citadel on a whitesand beach near– according to my admittedly amateur geolocating–modern-day Alameda. It’s fantastical digital tourism at its finest.That’s what you want from an open-world game, right? Not necessarily an airtight main plot, as nice as such a thing is, but a believable, well-realized world you can lose yourself in. In that regard, Horizon Forbidden West hits it out of the park.A side-quest in Horizon Forbidden West’s opening area introduces you to an elderly man. He’s sitting on a ledge high in the mountains, staring at a giant robot pterodactyl embedded in a rocky spire, well and truly dead. He’s convinced that its death was an act of the gods, that observing it will grant him salvation, and so he plans on sitting and staring and waiting until he’s shown the heavenly lit way to a new home where everything is safe. Aloy points out how, actually, the bird-robot was gunned down by heavy artillery. He doesn’t listen. He’s convinced it’s a sign.Setting aside the high-minded sci-fi hijinks, Horizon Forbidden West is at its core about the extent to which characters will go to find faith and meaning. In her newfound “savior” status—again, still weird—Aloy finds herself fielding many of these evidence-free assertions. People go on and on about “land gods” and “diviners” and “legacies” and blah blah blah. At every turn, Aloy reacts to these whims with curled-lip bemusement. They claim to see god. Aloy knows the truth; she literally sees it.By the end of the game, I found myself reacting to Horizon Forbidden West itself with a similar curled-lip bemusement.""No BotW to distract you this time!"" - Kotaku.comSci-fi twist on the Museum of Natural History's dino hallFluid combat, sharp dialogue, a rewarding open world, constantly getting distracted by how damn pretty everything is.Instances of tone-deafness, minor inconveniences due to outdated design, a story that goes off the railsGuerrilla GamesPS4, PS5 (played)February 18, 2022Roughly 50 hours to hit the credits with roughly 50 percent completionHorizon Zero Dawn succeeded for many, many reasons, though perhaps its strongest feature was the way it expertly conveyed a dual-timeline narrative split between past (how the earth succumbed to robot apocalypse) and present (how the earth’s current inhabitants want to prevent another one). You made as much of the tale as you wanted to. Audio logs and text messages filled in the backstory of how exactly the world dovetailed into shit. You could opt into these as much or as little as you chose, but even if you availed yourself of every one, you’d still not know everything, not really. You filled in the gaps yourself.Audio logs and text messages are still present (by the hundreds) in the sequel, but Horizon Forbidden West goes out of its way to explicitly address questions—not just those posed in this game but those lingering from the first one too. Horizon is at its most intriguing when you’re slowly unspooling the thread. The magic trick doesn’t quite land when you’re having everything imparted to you via lecture and exposition. You and I will never know every little thing about the real world we live in—about its people, about its history. Why do we need to know so much about this fake one? Where’s the room for some imagination?It’s not solely a problem with Horizon Forbidden West, nor is it a problem limited to video games. You see it across popular genre fiction these days, as everything from Star Wars to the Marvel Cinematic Universe doubles down on plot over people, going so far as to fill in backstories for enigmatic characters who were killed off years ago. Everyone does it these days. It’s the safe play. Welcome to the Era of Fandom.I thoroughly enjoyed Horizon Forbidden West, and I suspect anyone who loves open-world RPGs will thoroughly enjoy it as well. But despite getting a kick out of fighting robot dinos, despite the enthralling time sink of “Machine Strike,” despite finding myself ravenous to return to this rich, inspired open world, I can’t shake how plainly Forbidden West misses the one philosophical throughline that helped its predecessor ascend to greatness: Sometimes, the question is more interesting than the answer. "
Horizon Forbidden West,Chris Carter,Destructoid,https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-horizon-forbidden-west-ps5-version/,"darkIt’s been five years since Horizon Zero Dawn? It doesn’t feel like it! But within the context of the Horizon series as a whole, it does feel like Guerrilla Games has made a lot of strides in that time: and we all get to experience those efforts with Horizon Forbidden West.[This review contains broad spoilers for the first Horizon. No story spoilers for Horizon Forbidden West are present.]Horizon Forbidden West (PS4, PS5 [reviewed])
Developer: Guerrilla Games
Publisher: Sony
Released: February 18, 2022
MSRP: $69.99Let’s make this clear: if you liked Horizon Zero Dawn, you will in all likelihood dig Forbidden West. It’s a generally bigger, bolder sequel, without giving up what made the original game resonate with so many people.Since it’s been a while, it’s probably best if we recap the story just a bit. So Aloy is now aware of her role in the world, and how this Horizon universe came to be. We can dispense with the pageantry and most of the upfront mystery boxes. The sequel gets down to business, letting us know the stakes — the world is being corrupted unless Aloy can reenact preventative measures — and it kicks off immediately with that quest. The end of the first game presented a potential continuation of the narrative, with teases in tow, and Horizon Forbidden West delivers on that promise.I love that we’re presented with a clear sense of urgency immediately. “People are suffering” due to the terraforming, and Aloy has a plan to stop it (which is naturally going to have some twists and turns in there): easy hook! It also goes a little further with the technological angle now that the cat is out of the bag (especially when juxtaposed to less advanced societies), and we get to see more of her personal struggle with being a messiah figure now that she’s famous. How people react to that throws a wrench in the mix beyond the macro scope of the story.The technological/worldbuilding aspect of the narrative is not perfect, since it has to go bigger with what we already knew from the first game’s lighter touch and gradual reveal. It can get jargony and MacGuffin-ey — and there’s some cheesy dialogue choices — but it tethers all that with good character moments. It was very common for me to groan and light up in surprise in the same scene.This is fundamentally a different Aloy, and I prefer her journey in Horizon Forbidden West. We know her well at this point, and we get to see her fully unchained, on a practical and emotional level. While the dialogue is questionable at times (mostly from an expository standpoint), this world is still worth caring about. And for all of you continuity folks out there, we also get a reason for why she doesn’t have her upgraded gear (she “ran into trouble” before the events of the game).One thing that drew me in quickly beyond the renewed stakes was the world itself. It looks absolutely gorgeous on a PS5, and that’s due in part to the sequel’s brighter and more varied environments; the titular “west” of this universe. It all comes down to personal preference, but I found it really easy to get invested in this sequel’s aesthetic shift. It’s tough to talk about a few of the bigger areas without spoiling them, but suffice to say that a photo mode (which is included, to be clear) is a prerequisite. I’m also surprised at how well the team handled the underwater portions, which are usually a death knell in modern open-world games.I found it easier to get more invested in Horizon Forbidden West in general, actually, as there are more things to do as a whole. And I don’t mean “more pins in the map,” in a gamification/content dump sense. But tactically and mechanically, there are more options to approach how you play the game. More traps, extra weapons and items (and status effects), it all adds up. That sense of “setting the scene” for a big confrontation, then pulling the trigger and feeling satisfied in the ruin of your enemies, it’s all back.Gliding with the Shieldwing item (which makes open-world traversal so much better in tandem with the returning fast travel) and diving underwater with more expansive aquatic zones are huge parts of it. But there’s also more organic climbing opportunities thanks to a concerted effort to add more footholds, which make platforming that much more enjoyable from the smallest dungeon to the largest vista. Speaking of the former, underground areas tend to blend together less, as bunkers are more than just the same few types of layouts in Forbidden West.More enemies to fight is a huge plus, as the team generally goes bigger (literally), while putting a lot of love and care into the little guys, too. Machine and human-integrated fights add a wrinkle to a ton of marquee battles, and there are a few genuine “whoa” action game moments with story fights. All of this adds up to form a more dynamic, expansive game. Horizon Forbidden West is adopting some tried and true classic open-world design philosophies, too. Crafting and gathering are back, and it’s still just as serviceable as it was before. The crafting wheel keeps things efficient, and the detective vision (Focus) still justifies itself more than a lot of other projects.The visual feedback for the combat system makes fights a lot less frustrating, as you’ll be able to tell at a glance if something is plinking off armor, or digging into a soft spot with red and green arrows respectively; it’s not so busy that you lose track of everything. And when you get skill points like candy for trees with abilities that matter, you know you’re in for a good feedback loop. Cram in more accessibility options and you have a stew going.That expansiveness doesn’t come at a great cost, at least in my experience. I didn’t encounter very many bugs at all: just one instance where I had to refresh an area (leave and fast travel back) to talk to an NPC to trigger a quest. But given that Horizon Forbidden West — unlike another recent open-world game involving the undead — provides tons of auto-saves by default (and the option to manually save in whatever slots you want), it’s going to be hard to get into a truly game-breaking situation.I was worried about Horizon Forbidden West, but a few hours in a lot of my fears were eliminated. Guerrilla Games has a great handle on the open-world genre at this point, and knows how to cater to people who do like certain broader comfort-food elements without going overboard. It’s a shame that we have to wait so long between projects, but if it ensures this level of quality, I can deal.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]GreatImpressive efforts with a few noticeable problems holding them back. Won't astound everyone, but is worth your time and cash.

Jason Faulkner 
The follow-up to 2017’s Horizon Zero Dawn is one of the most eagerly anticipated titles of 2022, and for good reason. Its unique sci-fi take on humanity’s future set captivated players and made us want to see Aloy’s story through to the end. Horizon Forbidden West picks up right where the first game lets off and takes us into uncharted territory as Aloy tries to fulfill her destiny and complete the mission of Project Zero Dawn.Aloy defeated HADES at the conclusion of Horizon Zero Dawn, but it might have been for naught. Machines continue to run rampant and attack humans, crops are withering and dying, the Red Blight is spreading across the land, killing anything it touches, and massive storms blow savage winds and rain that threaten to drown out humanity’s last refuges. The terraforming system is collapsing, and it’s only a matter of time before the Earth becomes uninhabitable.So, Aloy is determined to find a backup of the terraforming AI GAIA. The original sacrificed herself to prevent HADES from using her power to destroy the ecosphere, but Aloy figures there must be at least one backup remaining. The data she has indicates that if she can reinitialize GAIA and reintegrate her subsystems, Zero Dawn can be saved, and the terraforming can be properly completed.The tale that ensues is one of the most engrossing we’ve seen on the PS5 yet and is an excellent swansong for the PS4. The Forbidden West introduces us to a ton of new characters, including the agrarian Utaru tribe and the warrior Tenkaths. We also get hints at what’s happening outside of the former United States with the introduction of the Quen.Attention to the lore really pays off in Forbidden West as a lot of questions that were posed by the first game are answered. Unlike Zero Dawn, which revealed the past in small snippets, the floodgates open up here, and the full picture of humanity’s downfall becomes clear.The gameplay in Horizon Forbidden West is much the same as in its predecessor. There are no significant changes to any of the systems. Instead, it builds on the exploration and combat and improves many of the issues players had with Zero Dawn.For the most part, you’re going to be doing a lot of exploration. The Forbidden West is covered in old ruins, tribal settlements, mountains, forests, and deserts. This time, there’s more verticality involved, and climbing has been revamped to be semi-freeform. It’s not quite like Breath of the Wild, where you could climb anywhere, but there are many more opportunities for scaling surfaces available.Aloy also gets some new tools to assist in navigation. These are introduced throughout the game and help you bypass obstacles that would otherwise block you from progressing. The Pullcaster serves as a grappling hook that lets you pull yourself up to anchors. Alternatively, you can use it to pull open vents, clear rubble, or pull crates. Aloy also gets a Shieldwing, which can be used to safely glide from heights, and a Diving Mask that allows her to breath underwater.Aloy’s new ability to travel underwater is one of the big highlights of the game and is used to significant effect. However, I don’t think the devs used it enough. One of the main missions takes place almost entirely underwater, but then the mechanic takes a backseat for the rest of the game. Since we have access to the coast of California, I would have liked to have seen some side quests diving in the ruins of San Fransisco and more opportunities for underwater exploration in general. As it is, you can dive underwater, but there’s not a ton of meaningful stuff to do there outside of picking up some aquatic plants and harvesting marine animals.Combat sees a bit of an upgrade in Forbidden West as well. The basics are still the same. Each enemy type has weakpoints and is strong and weak versus different elements. This time around, though, you can cause elemental overloads by hitting specific points with attacks of the right element. Hitting shock coils, for example, with a shock attack will cause it to overload after a short time and explode, which will immediately affect the machine with the stunned status effect. This allows for a quick follow-up with a critical melee attack which can do massive damage.Because of elemental overloads and weaknesses, it’s less imperative to remove armor this time around. Instead, you’ll want to use the improved scanner functionality to discover an enemy’s weaknesses and exploit them with the proper damage type. There are a few new elements this time around as well: Plasma, Acid, and Purgewater. However, one, Corruption, has been removed.Because of the added ability to hit enemies with status effects and their increased weaknesses, combat doesn’t feel as grueling this time around. You can also equip new Valor Surges, which give Aloy a timed buff. These correspond to the six skill trees (up from three in the last game) and can do things like increase ranged damage or stealth ability.Unfortunately, I found myself using machine overrides less and less. Many of the overrides now require you to both visit a cauldron and craft them using very rare machine parts, and the payoff just isn’t worth it. I get that the ability can be overpowered, but combat options have expanded enough to where just outright defeating machines is easy and fun enough that I didn’t want to go on a grand crusade to craft the overrides.Crafting is still a big part of gameplay and has been moderately improved. The inventory UI is better in general, and being able to refill Aloy’s materials from your stash easily makes crafting in the field much less irritating.However, one flaw does carry over from the first game, and it’s one we see in many open-world titles. There’s just too much crap to pick up. After every fight, you have to scour the area to make sure you grab every little doodad you’ve knocked off a machine. After the 35 hours or so it took to beat the main story (not to mention the additional 40-50 to knock out the rest of the content), I got tired of hoovering everything up.I wish Aloy could have crafted a little robot parrot to auto-loot the area, especially since getting some of the rarer machine materials requires you to knock off very specific parts that can be hard to find afterward. At the very least, some sort of auto collection for rare and higher-grade materials would have been appreciated.I would have also appreciated a cosmetic armor slot. Each armor has unique stats and buffs, so I often find myself wearing an outfit I didn’t like because it fit my playstyle. My Aloy shouldn’t have to look like a frump just because I need those concentration boosts.I played Horizon Forbidden West on the PS5 and regularly switched between performance and quality modes. You get a full 4K at 30fps and all the fancy lighting and particle effects in quality mode. However, I didn’t notice a massive difference in visuals between the two modes. Performance mode gets you 60fps with a variable resolution. Despite being lower fidelity, I suspect that most players will enjoy the latter mode more. The higher framerates really make the game come to life and highlight the great animations and combat.Unfortunately, there were some issues with the visuals, which were only somewhat alleviated by the day one patch. The game suffers from pop-in, which can be extremely noticeable in some areas. Sometimes it seemed like Level of Detail models weren’t loading in at all. I’d be heading toward an object, and parts of it would be hanging in the air until I was right on top of it, and then a building or tree would immediately appear out of thin air. This might be a bug instead of a limitation of the engine or console because it didn’t always happen.Horizon Forbidden West is a great sequel that’s full of twists and turns that ended in a satisfying conclusion. I won’t spoil anything, but it takes the series in a very interesting direction that I didn’t see coming when the game began. While not vastly different, the gameplay is a definite improvement over the original.Aside from some very minor bugs, Forbidden West was a treat to play and is an early contender for Game of the Year. Aloy’s journey across the West is a must-play for PlayStation owners and another reminder that Sony’s first-party studios are at the cutting edge of gaming.9Jason Faulkner is the Senior Editor of Game Revolution and PlayStation LifeStyle.

Horizon Forbidden West,Bill Lavoy,Shacknews,https://www.shacknews.com/article/128800/horizon-forbidden-west-review-big-machine,"New to Shacknews? Signup for a Free AccountAlready have an account? Login NowGuerrilla Games delivers a massive experience with Horizon Forbidden West that's sure to be a big hit among open world aficionados.Big open world games have a unique opportunity not afforded to titles that are smaller in scope. The number of moving parts allows developers to miss with one or two things and still provide an incredible experience. The key is to create mechanics fun and engaging enough to drown out the weaker ones. Horizon Forbidden West falls directly into this category, shining brightly in ways that make its few misses seem not so bad.Horizon Forbidden West is a post-apocalyptic open world game that continues Aloy’s journey. A huntress of the Nora tribe, Aloy earned the title of Brave by completing the Proving in Horizon Zero Dawn, a tournament held to test the skills of Nora adolescents. The events of the Proving became the catalyst for the story of Horizon Zero Dawn, with the High Matriarchs of the Nora tribe declaring Aloy a Seeker, someone who is allowed to explore beyond the borders of Nora land. That exploration and the events that unfolded made up the entirety of Horizon Zero Dawn, so we’ll stop there to avoid spoilers. Thankfully, Guerrilla Games has provided a handy recap tucked into the Extras menu before Horizon Forbidden West begins, so even those who didn’t partake in Aloy’s initial adventures can get caught up in short order.Horizon Forbidden West begins with Aloy searching for GAIA, a powerful AI that was responsible for the governance of the Zero Dawn Project that predates any events found in the games. This project was a terraforming system that was designed to restore life on Earth after rogue machines began eating biological matter. When things went sideways (massive understatement), GAIA sacrificed herself for humanity. Now, Aloy and her allies must search for GAIA to stop a blight that is threatening civilization. If that sounds like a lot for one person, it is, and Aloy’s personal journey running parallel to the overarching narrative includes grappling with that weight and the lofty expectations she puts on herself simultaneously.Once players set foot in the world, those that played Horizon Zero Dawn will feel a familiar gameplay loop in Horizon Forbidden West. This is not a reset of the systems, but rather an evolution. Aloy can still hide in tall grass to evade enemies or confront them head on with her spear, but both combat and exploration take steps forward thanks to gadgets like the Diving Mask or Gliderwing, and weapons like the Spike Thrower and Shredder Gauntlet. The Spike Thrower became a personal favorite because it's essentially a spear you throw that can do massive damage. It's a great way to get out to an early lead in a boss fight. These additions are all a success, delivering a fantastic experience that persists through the entirety of Horizon Forbidden West.From new gadgets that make exploration and combat more unique, to the skill tree expansion and introduction of Valor Surges, Horizon Forbidden West's gameplay is its greatest strength. I was heavily invested in hunting down machines for parts to upgrade my gear or skill points to unlock new abilities. The more I experimented, the more I realized that Horizon Forbidden West had considerable depth to its combat. At first, it feels like you’re just whacking machines with a stick until they topple, but soon you’re chaining attacks together and overwhelming your foes with speed and damage.It all starts with a skill tree that includes six branches: Warrior, Trapper, Hunter, Survivor, Infiltrator, and Machine Master. You can lean into one or two heavily or split your skill points by picking and choosing bits and pieces of each. If you invest in the right skills in a specific branch, you’ll unlock a Valor Surge that reflects that branch’s theme. Being a stealth player who enjoys the Hunter Bow and Spike Thrower, I dug into Hunter and Infiltrator. My go-to Valor Surge was called Stealth Stalker, allowing me to cloak and navigate tricky areas without being seen. These Valor Surges can be swapped in and out as required, so I’d swap the Stealth Stalker for Ranged Master to do massive damage with ranged weapons ahead of boss fights.This is how Horizon Forbidden West builds a satisfying gameplay loop. As you learn how different weapons and skills can be effective against various machines, you begin chasing those items. Any time I saw a vendor who sells weapons, I was dropping everything to browse their stock. When I found an item I wanted, I’d either buy it or create a Job (a self-created quest to locate needed resources to purchase or upgrade an item) to find the parts to buy it. This pushed me into the world to get those components, and along the path I’d inevitably discover a Cauldron to clear, Relic Ruin to explore, or Tallneck to climb. I’d run into new machines that pose different challenges, encouraging me to unlock new skills and buy more gear to deal with these new threats. It’s a rewarding cycle that never felt like a grind, but the one thing I wanted was a way to reset the skill tree. If it’s in the game, I haven’t found it, and there are certainly some skills I’d pass on in favor of others a second time around. Thankfully, you're swimming in skill points, so resetting the tree isn't crucial.This core gameplay loop is reinforced by some nifty additions, like Food Boosts obtained by purchasing meals from chefs found at various settlements throughout the world, or environmental traps capable of dealing big damage to big foes. Most of these can be ignored on lower difficulties if you just want to hit the big machine with the big stick, but the payoff is fantastic if you properly prepare for a fight and execute your strategy. I particularly enjoyed the moments before fighting a Cauldron boss, studying the machine and going through my inventory to find the right weapons and elements. Cauldron's are dungeon-like locations that Aloy can unseal. You'll typically work your way through a jumping puzzle of sorts, then fight a boss at the end. The reward is not only machine components, but also the ability to override a new machine and possibly mount it.Riding a machine makes traversal of the world much easier, and there is a lot of world to see and many things to do. You'll find yourself grabbing all sorts of collectibles, playing the new Strike mini game, and even partaking in races. There are activities around every corner, but none are forced on you. Feel free to dive into the things you enjoy and pass on the ones you don't. Horizon Forbidden West offers a plethora of content, but lets you pick and choose between it. If you are someone looking to see and do everything, expect to spend north of 70 hours in Horizon Forbidden West, and that's probably on the low end of estimates. Where I’m hot and cold with Horizon Forbidden West is its narrative. I was heavily invested in the main story and Aloy’s internal struggles. It was rewarding to watch her grow with the help of friends, though seeing Aloy struggle to live up to expectations she created for herself was at times difficult. Many will relate to the way she puts personal wellbeing and growth aside because there are more important matters at hand. Many of us ignore our own needs for what we perceive as the greater good, and in Aloy’s case the greater good is the survival of humanity. Point for Aloy.Where I fell off with my narrative interest was with random quest givers in the world. I thought Aloy’s immediate group of friends and allies all had interesting motives and asks, but once you get into the random population and tribes, the motive is mostly pure survival. Look, it’s as basic as it gets. It’s literally the core motive of every species that’s ever existed. It’s also not very interesting from one character to the next. In Horizon Forbidden West, I played main story missions because they were interesting, but I completed side quests for skill points and gear. The redeeming detail is that side quests include combat with machines comprised of components you want. They reward skill points that further your build and reward XP to level up. The tasks themselves are often interesting, I just didn’t really care about most of the characters asking for help.My hope is that everyone gets a chance to play Horizon Forbidden West on a PS5 with a 4K display. Guerrilla Games has created a breathtaking world. Whether it’s a quiet moment looking at the clear night sky, or a trek through snowy mountains, Horizon Forbidden West is a shining example of what the PS5 can accomplish with graphics, not unlike 2021's Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart. My experience was smoother when set to Performance (high frame rate) instead of Resolution (consistent resolution), so take note in case that setting matters to you. I didn’t notice dips in resolution when I was set to Performance.The one visual downfall of Horizon Forbidden West is that it does not include color blind settings, which is a major oversight for a game that uses color to differentiate between components on machines that can be individually targeted. It’s perplexing given the effort put into accessibility, as Horizon Forbidden West includes custom difficulty options, co-pilot mode, button mapping, and settings to tweak the experience to very specific needs. I don’t know how many times I didn’t target a component vulnerable to chain reaction because I couldn’t tell which part it was. I would often opt for tear damage on larger components that I could see. Some of this was alleviated with combat experience, but color blind options are needed here.Being color blind meant that I often had to get very close to machines to differentiate their components, but there was a silver lining to this. The closer I was to machines, the more I found myself admiring the subtle beep and boop sounds they make as they go about their business. It almost gives a peaceful personality to machines that can turn violent in an instant. It’s also helpful to hear their telltale sounds over the crest of a hill, giving you the advantage over what lies ahead.Horizon Forbidden West does a masterful job with its sound across the board, including wonderful performances by its actors. Ashly Burch is fantastic, but so is a supporting cast that includes Angela Bassett, Lance Reddick, Carrie-Anne-Moss, Noshir Dalal, and more. Their performances are backed up by music that complements gameplay, building tension as you explore a Cauldron, only to fade after you defeat its boss. It’s not a new mechanic by any means, but I still love how tense music fades when the battle is over, letting you know that you can exhale.Horizon Forbidden West is an ambitious game that builds off the strengths of its predecessor in almost every way. The world is a more interesting place to spend time, the combat has evolved, and the visuals have taken leaps that exceeded my expectations even with the generation jump in hardware. It’s a shame that outside of the core cast there is a depth lacking for most of the characters, and leaving color blind options out of a game that uses color in its mechanics is a miss on otherwise great accessibility options. What I can’t let go of, though, is just how good Horizon Forbidden West is everywhere else. I need to find all the weapons. I must unlock all the skills. I’ve got to know what’s in those Relic Ruins or solve the puzzle and defeat the boss in the Cauldron. Horizon Forbidden West is absurdly good in so many ways that it borders on must-play for open world aficionados.This review is based on a PS5 digital download code provided by Sony Interactive Entertainment.

Horizon Forbidden West,Dom Peppiatt,VG247,https://www.vg247.com/horizon-forbidden-west-review-ps5,"Aloy is set to go west – where the skies are blue – but will life be peaceful there, or will mysterious threats ruin her freshly-minted hero status?You’ve just slid under a robotic elephant’s tusk as it tried to gore you with the entirety of its 10-tonne-plus weight. Some of your flowing red hair caught the tip of its kevlar tusk. But that hasn’t phased you; you look up, pull out an explosive spear and jam it under the beast’s jaw. A dodge roll to safety, a quick sprint behind a nearby knoll, and a look over your shoulder tells you it was a clean hit – the resulting explosion took the beast’s plated armour clean off. You notch an arrow to your bow, concentrate as you take aim, and fire. Bullseye! The tusk comes off, clean. Just what you needed for that weapon upgrade. 
Does this sound familiar? Because it is. Moment-to-moment, Horizon Forbidden West isn’t all that different from Zero Dawn. Sure, there are more bells and whistles, the world is bigger (and, somehow, also more dense), you’ve got some fancy new ways of getting about, and there are some new robotic animals to dispatch. But this is Zero Dawn, Mark II. For better and for worse. 
Guerrilla Games bolted out the gate with aplomb on its first venture into the reset future of the Horizon universe, kitbashing together some fluid My First Monster Hunter combat, a rich and tempting world full of collectible goodies, and a story that had the true identity of red-headed huntress Aloy nestled snugly at its center. Without that central conceit, though, Forbidden West seemed like a dubious proposition – could this 60-plus hour game keep me entertained, even when this main plot point has been removed?
Short answer; ""yes"" with an ""if."" Long answer, ""no"" with a ""but"". What Forbidden West lacks in narrative punch, it makes up for with its combat and some spectacularly-conceived set pieces. Just when you get bored with an errand making you go kill a Snapmaw again, or when you get frustrated with being sent back to an already-plundered location for a side quest when there’s a whole world to explore, the game always has another hook baited for you in a story mission to get you back onside.
But that’s not to say all the superfluous stuff is turgid; take the Tallnecks – those giraffe-cum-Brontasaurus machines from the first game that you need to climb to unveil local map markers. Forbidden West only wants you to do the standard find, climb, and scan stuff once. From then on, there’s always another way of tackling them – whether that’s using ballistas to bring them down in the midst of a Ravager siege, figuring out how to navigate a rudimentary Go Ape course to get high enough to override them, or whatever else, there’s typically a fresh take on the assumed task. A fair share of the map icons in Forbidden West map do this, too. Eat your heart out, Assassin’s Creed.
Open world fatigue is real, of course. A wealth of errands are drab, and the writing outside of the main quest (and main cast) is questionable at best, off-putting at worst. But that’s fine, because you’re only doing some of those missions to get more experience, right? The meat of this game is in working through the story, and wrapping up loose ends that fray off from the main narrative thread in the process. It’s just a shame about the go-here, do-this trudge that forms a large percent of the non-story experience.
About 10 hours in, you’ll unlock a sort-of hub – a home for Aloy where allies and friends gather. It reminds me of Mass Effect and the Normandy; you can grab what are effectively loyalty missions from the ragtag team that assembles over the course of the game. Here lies the game’s heart, really; the end of the world is fast approaching, but going off on one to find a replacement arm for your ex-warrior mate resounds a lot more than stopping some sort of synthetic plague. 
Guerrilla uses this base to really throw you out into the world, too, and highlight the bits it really wants you to see (and rightly so, because the map is bloody massive). ‘Remember that place you ran through in this story mission?’ the developer asks when you ask your newly-found friend why they’re so glum. ‘Go back there, and really get to know it. We think you’ll enjoy it.’ Suddenly, my quest to halt the terraforming threat that’s about to bring the world to its knees evaporates, and I’m in a village ogling the local flora and trying to find a way to make someone I’ve known for about 25 minutes a bit less sad. Credit to you, Guerrilla, you’ve side-tracked me again, and I’m enjoying it. This time.
It helps that this is one of the best-looking games I’ve ever played, too. Being tossed from the top of the map to its left-most extreme is bearable if I’m going from frozen mountains to lush, West Coast beaches. ‘Hey, maybe I’ll stop off at that jungle village en route to mop up that combat pit quest,’ I think as I set out on what will no doubt be a three-hour detour. An hour of that is in Photo Mode, as I try to capture Aloy’s face as she gets clotheslined off her mount into the snow, and some electric-fanged panther thing comes diving at her.
The combat itself is pumping. The new additions – Valor Surges you can deploy like special moves that give you stat buffs, new melee options that make hand-to-hand less of a drag, new weapons to break up the rhythm – are all OK, but they’re nothing worth writing home about. This series is always going to be about the rhythm of trapping, sneaking and shooting from range – every single encounter (except a few specific story battles) give you the option of starting from stealth. And rightly so, because that’s what this game is all about. 
The Decima Engine’s obsession with growing long grass everywhere gives you plenty of opportunity to get close to machines, target their weak parts, and go about dissembling them with precision bow shots, explosive javelins, boomerang discs, plasma-loaded crossbow bolts, acid bombs and whatever other deadly ephemera Aloy has managed to cram into her suspiciously concealed pouches. 
When the game is firing on all cylinders (you’ve set a trap to knock an avian machine out the air, you’ve peppered with arrows on the way down, and now you’re flinging glue bombs at it with impish glee), it’s hard not to love Forbidden West. It makes you feel like a superhero. After a fight with some behemoth bat-like thing in a late-game story mission, a companion remarks “I’ve never seen anyone fight machines like you Aloy!” Damn straight. I just took its ears off from about 100 meters away! Then I set it on fire! As I shredded its wings with razors! I’m a hunter god.
It’s a shame that the connective tissue between the set-pieces fails to burn as clean as the rest of the game. It’s thrilling to hit a new big narrative beat, see the wondrous zones that open up before you, and marvel at the technological feats Guerrilla has crammed into the game (the Las Vegas bit is going to be an all-timer, for example). But once you’ve saved the day for the locals and they start whining about a local machine that’s stolen their fuel supply, or want you to retrieve something from an outcrop in those hills, you start to roll your eyes. ‘I’m only doing this because I need the money,’ you mutter under your breath as you accept. You don’t do that in The Witcher, do you?
A novel mini-game helps plaster over some of the cracks in your downtime, and a breadth of collectibles litter the map, too, but there’s no hiding from the fact that – on the exhale – Forbidden West suffers from open world bloat. It’s satisfying to leap off a mountaintop, glide down into a new biome, absolutely obilterate some peacefully grazing machines and then grappling hook your way outta there, but rinse and repeat that across the whole map and it starts to get a bit monotonous. 
Perhaps I’m focusing a bit too much on the negatives here, but it’s what forms a lot of the process. I’ve put over 60 hours into Horizon: Forbidden West for this review, and the majority of that time has been spent in the world, helping my companions with their woes, and tending to the moronic NPCs that can’t do anything for themselves. It casts a shadow on the bombast and intrigue of the central plot – in a world where we’re seeing games weave these two elements together so satisfyingly, you can’t help but notice a title that doesn’t.
Horizon: Forbidden West does a great job of building on the foundation that Zero Dawn laid out; everything is more beautiful, the stakes are – somehow – higher, and the flirtations with BioWare-style story ideas shows just how much of a future this series has. The exploration and combat pillars of the game sing in harmony, too… it’s just a shame that there’s so much sludgy filler amongst all that well-oiled machine killer.

Horizon Forbidden West,Chris White,God is a Geek,https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/horizon-forbidden-west-review/,"February 18, 2022Four whole years have passed since Aloy’s last adventure. Ever since, the red-haired warrior has been a part of the gaming zeitgeist. She became a PlayStation icon, much like Nathan Drake, Ratchet & Clank, and Sackboy. She was a woman who was physically and mentally strong, showed great courage in the face of adversity, and saved the world which Guerrilla created. Horizon Zero Dawn was a masterpiece. To paraphrase Shakespeare, Aloy was the stage, and the men and women around her were merely players. With such a force of nature, it was inevitable there would be a sequel. Not only that, but the huge cliffhanger at the end of Zero Dawn screamed out for more. Horizon Forbidden West is not just a worthy sequel, it’s another triumph, and quite possibly Guerrilla’s magnum opus.In every way, Horizon Forbidden West is superior to its predecessor. There’re new mechanics, tons of collectables and side quests, a dense and dynamic map, and more machines to fight and befriend. The story is also grander in every way, feeling much like The Empire Strikes Back did to A New Hope. Blight is ravaging the land, and a new threat is sending the world to the edge of extinction. Throughout the story, Aloy befriends new faces while working with old friends to stop the mysterious new enemy called the Zeniths. Sylens is back, and his mysterious post-credits scene from the prior game is explained. I thoroughly enjoyed Aloy’s journey in Forbidden West.The new land is dangerous, filled with fierce weather systems and machines ready to rip you from limb to limb. Not only that, but people can be just as deadly. Thankfully, Aloy is more than equipped to try and save humanity. There’re tons of weapons that can be used to take out various enemies, all with specific elemental ammo for those particularly vulnerable, whether it be fire, frost, or acid. There’re a range of bows that do damage at short and long range, with some best used to tear off machine parts. The Boltcaster is a powerful weapon that fires bursts of ammo in quick succession, and the BlastSling fires bombs to great effect. Aloy still has the Tripcaster shocking enemies and knocking them down, as well as Ropecaster for tying machines up to allow for flurries of damage.The spear is a masterful short range weapon for attacking enemies, and can deliver critical strikes and severe damage when used properly. New gadgets include the Shieldwing which is used for gliding from high places; the Diving Mask for swimming underwater without losing oxygen; the Igniter which destroys Firegleam and gets you into previously obstructed places; the Vinecutter that breaks down vines blocking entrances; and the Pullcaster allows you to grapple to higher points, pull machinery and platforms, and remove large amounts of rubble from blocked pathways. Horizon Forbidden West is filled with plenty of opportunities to make use of every piece of equipment.By defeating machines and killing other humans, the amount of craftable items can feel overwhelming. However, once you start to learn what parts are needed for what you want to buy or craft, there’s a satisfying flow to Horizon Forbidden West’s economy. By collecting machine parts, a visit to merchants across the map or workbenches let you craft new stuff, making your equipment better suited to deal with bigger threats. Metal Shards are the game’s currency, and can be used to spend how you wish, as well as repairing overridden machines. Coils and weaves can be equipped to weapons and outfits for added buffs to specific attacks or elemental specific gear. You can also use traps to great effect.Each machine will be weak or strong to particular elements. You can also focus on particular parts so that they lose particular opportunities to attack. Shoot an acid arrow at one of the cannisters on a Brickleback’s lower back and it’s game over. Shoot a Burrower in the eye and it’ll go down instantly. When it comes to larger machines like the Tideripper, Slaughterspine, Thunderjaw, or Tremortusk, there’re still plenty of ways to weaken its defences. You need to make sure you study them, whether in battle or from a far. This is part of why I adore the machines of Horizon Forbidden West. They are expertly designed, and each one is completely different from the next. Not only that, machines can be overridden. Find all the Cauldrons and its core to ride them in the wild.The map of Horizon Forbidden West is gigantic. Not only is it large, it is packed full of things to do. Relic Ruins hide orbs, and offer clever puzzles to solve. Rebel Camps and Outposts are filled with enemy clans to wipe out; Salvage Contracts let you find specific machine parts for a reward; Hunting Grounds and Melee Pits test your skills as a warrior; and finding all Tallnecks reveal more of the map’s secrets. There are Black Boxes and Vista Points to find that offer glimpses of the past; surveyor drones to take down; and so much more. Even the side quests are huge, with each one feeling more than just some generic fetch quest. Guerrilla has made sure everyone will have the option to spend hundreds of hours exploring the Forbidden West.On PS5, Horizon Forbidden West is stunning. The frozen and dangerous mountains; the sandstorms in the desert; the sunny coastline; the swamps and jungles. Everywhere you go, the landscapes are remarkable. Every inch of the map has been given plenty of attention. It feels like a living, breathing world. I was in awe of the fantastic job done in making the world so alive. The way the machines exist in their own habitat is incredible. It’s hard to use words to do justice to how spectacular the various environments are. Character animations are equally impressive. Combined with the impressive acting on display, the entire experience will be one not easily forgettable.Horizon Forbidden West is an enormous title that is filled to the brim with exciting missions and content. Combat consistently evolves, and the range of weapons and gear is staggering. The story is consistently engaging, and the characters are well-realised and thoroughly interesting. Aloy’s adventure is by far one of the most thrilling of this generation so far. She continues to be one of PlayStation’s most-beloved characters. Machines are perhaps the greatest part of the entire adventure. It’s fun to fight them, but also to watch them exist. They feel real. They feel alive. As much as I enjoyed taking them down, I found it highly satisfying to live among them.I’ve not seen a game look this spectacular before. From the various biomes and how their ecosystems work, to the vibrancy of the world and how NPCs all go about their daily lives, Horizon Forbidden West is another blockbuster. Bigger than the original in every way, I honestly can’t fault the stunning work Guerrilla Games has done in bringing the next chapter in Aloy’s story to the PlayStation 5. There isn’t a doubt in my mind it’ll be discussed in great detail come end of year discussions for GOTY. All that’s left for me to say is make sure you put time aside to play one of the greatest single player games of all time.An engaging story
Gorgeous visuals
Machines are expertly designed

Horizon Forbidden West,Diego Perez,Attack of the Fanboy,https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/horizon-forbidden-west-review/,"The PlayStation 5 has been out for nearly a year and half now (for those of you who have been lucky enough to get your hands on one), and the initial summer 2020 reveal event feels like it happened just yesterday. Many titles were shown off during that reveal showcase, including Returnal and Demon’s Souls, but Sony closed the show with Horizon Forbidden West, the follow-up to former Killzone developer Guerilla Games’ 2017 new IP. Forbidden West was positioned as one of the PS5’s first killer apps, a can’t miss title from a first-party PlayStation studio. It wouldn’t just be the sequel to one of the most beloved PS4 games, but it’d also be a taste of what’s to come with the next generation of PlayStation.While there’s also a PS4 version of the game accompanying the PS5 release and we’ve already seen a fair number of next-gen showcases by this point, Horizon Forbidden West has continued to impress in all of its pre-release showings. Now that the game is making its way into players’ hands, the question can finally be answered: Is Horizon Forbidden West a true next-gen experience like it was marketed to be?As the name implies, Horizon Forbidden West sends Aloy to the western region of what used to be the United States in search of a solution for an unstoppable blight that has been ravaging the scattered tribes of the land. Although Aloy saved the day once in the events of Horizon Zero Dawn, the post-apocalypse now has yet another apocalypse looming. The Forbidden West is a dangerous and unfamiliar place crawling with new machines to battle, new locales to explore, and new tribes to encounter. It’s a surprisingly varied place, and it makes a fantastic setting for this sequel.Just like the first game, Horizon Forbidden West’s story has two major threads. There’s the present-day plot revolving around Aloy, the tribes of the Forbidden West, and Aloy’s colorful cast of supporting characters, and then there’s the ancient plot centered around the Old Ones, humanity before the collapse that led to the current state of the world. Horizon Zero Dawn’s central mystery about the Old Ones and the origin of the machines was a huge highlight, and the sequel has huge shoes to fill when it comes to crafting a compelling narrative. Unfortunately, most of the novelty of discovering how Horizon’s world works has worn off, but the sequel still has its fair share of secrets to discover.While you’ll still learn a lot of new things about the old world in Horizon Forbidden West, Aloy’s personal journey takes center stage this time. Now that players already know the basics about Zero Dawn, the machines, and the Old Ones, the game takes much more time to flesh out the main cast of characters and the tribes of the Forbidden West, delving deeper into their customs, traditions, and day to day lives. Forbidden West really feels like the next chapter in a singular story rather than a fully standalone sequel. You can probably still enjoy it without having played Zero Dawn, but you’ll be missing out on a whole lot of context that the game expects you to understand going in.The switch to a more personal story seems like a strange decision at first, especially with the game’s somewhat slow start, but once you get settled in with the main cast and start working through some of the side quest chains, starts to make sense. Just like the first game, Aloy is an incredibly strong protagonist. She’s grown a great deal since Zero Dawn, and it shows. Her exploits have made her much more assertive and confident, but she still has depth. She’s already saved the world once, but as every victory leads to another seemingly impossible challenge, she still struggles with self-doubt.Also, because of her origins as an outcast, Aloy still struggles to work with other people, and her world-saving journey requires her to have a few friends by her side. Thankfully, Forbidden West’s supporting cast is much more fleshed out than Zero Dawn’s and watching Aloy open up to them and grow more comfortable working with a team is the emotional core of the story. Even the side quests feel much more meaningful this time around. They’re filled with cutscenes and give out much more worthwhile rewards, so it’s hard to skip them when you come across them.Of course, the combat has always been the shining star for Horizon, and it’s better than ever before in Forbidden West. The core tenants are still the same: shoot weak points with your bow, set traps and tripwires around the arena, and use other tools to give yourself an advantage. Most of the weapons from the first game return, so you can use your old loadout if you want to stick to what you know. Forbidden West’s new weapons are the best of the bunch though. The Spike Thrower lets Aloy chuck spears at her enemies, and the powerful burst-fire Boltblaster is perfect for destroying parts.Forbidden West also features a much more expansive skill tree that really lets you prioritize the parts of combat you like the most. There are multiple trees that you can dump skills into, and you can ignore the ones that you don’t like. If you want to improve Aloy’s melee capabilities but don’t care about traps or stealth at all, then you can do that. Skill trees also unlock new weapon techniques for each weapon type, which are special alternate firing modes that require stamina to use. These range from nocking multiple arrows at the same time or instantly placing a tripwire without having to manually line it up. These add a new layer of depth to an already deep combat system, and they allow you to specialize in the strategies that you enjoy.The game’s enemy designs also play a large part in making combat so enjoyable. The Forbidden West is home to multiple new machines, and each of the newcomers is a blast to fight. The big ones shown off in trailers like the snake-like Slitherfang are threatening boss enemies, but even the smaller enemies like the monkey-like Clamberjaws are fun to take down. Each machine requires a different strategy to fight, and even the smaller ones still pose a threat.The game’s new upgrade system ensures that you’ll see a wide range of machines as well. Each piece of gear, including both armor and weapons, can now be upgraded several times. You’ll still want to replace your early-game gear with rarer stuff later down the line, but you can get more life out of your equipment and unlock more of its perks by upgrading it. When you need a part for an upgrade, you can create a quest for it and the game will mark its exact location on your map. With this system, you can essentially go on hunting trips specifically for the machines that you need, ignoring the actual list of side quests to go on your own personal little side quests.The upgrade system exemplifies all the best parts of Horizon Forbidden West. It places as little resistance as possible between you and the things you need, cutting out the busy work and just letting you get out into the world and fight the cool robots. You can spend hours just going down the list of upgrade materials, planning out hunts and trying out new weapons. First on the list is a Snapmaw, then maybe you can fast travel over there and fight a Thunderjaw, and so on, all the while earning skill points to unlock new abilities to try out in combat against the next machine. It’s a mesmerizing loop.The game’s actual side content is great, too, and there’s a lot of it. Everything is organized into sections in your quest log, so you can pick exactly what you want to do. There are your standard side activities like Rebel Camps and Hunting Grounds, but there are also addicting new activities like the Machine Strike minigame or old-world ruins that contain treasures. Even the things that existed in the first game like Cauldrons and Tallnecks have been improved upon. Each one feels unique, and the twists that you encounter with each one keep them from feeling like cookie-cutter content.Getting around the world is also much easier in Forbidden West. Aloy has a new grappling hook called the Pullcaster, but it can only be used to move objects around or to zip to specific ledges. There’s also a new glider, but don’t expect to get very far with it. It’s really just to break your fall. The climbing system has also been vastly improved. You can’t freely climb anything, but you’re no longer limited to scripted sequences with bright yellow paint. You can now scan cliffsides with your focus and see highlighted handholds, which is helpful given how much verticality there is in this game. Oh, and don’t forget flying mounts, which are exactly as cool as they sound.The Forbidden West itself is also much more varied than you would think. There are multiple radically different biomes in the game, and each of them feels massive. The snowy mountains feel impossibly tall thanks to the aforementioned verticality, forests feel super dense, and even underwater sections are enjoyable to explore. Every inch of this game is gorgeous, and the scale is equally impressive.That’s on PlayStation 5 though, and there is a PS4 version of Horizon Forbidden West launching on day one as well. The PS5 version does have a ton of next-gen enhancements though, and it’s obviously worth getting that version if you have the choice. Loading times are blazing fast, the DualSense features make combat feel great, and the game is beautiful in 4K. The game also uses the cutscene character lighting system during gameplay on PS5, which sounds like a small feature, but it makes a noticeable difference. Finally, PS5 players can opt to play at 6o FPS, which is arguably the biggest improvement.Despite all that though, the game still looks and runs fine on PlayStation 4. Horizon Forbidden West was touted as a next-gen showpiece when it was first revealed for PlayStation 5, but now that it’s here, it reveals a much more comforting truth: cross-generation games are fine and will be fine for a long time this generation. Horizon Forbidden West feels like a next-gen experience. It constantly wowed me with its visuals, its scope, its presentation, and everything in between. It doesn’t feel held back at all.That doesn’t discount the PS4 version, either. Both are enjoyable ways to experience the game. Even though the PS5 version is noticeably better, the days of a last-gen game looking and running much worse compared to its next-gen counterpart (looking at you MGSV and Shadow of Mordor) are long behind us.Despite how enjoyable Horizon Forbidden West is from start to finish, the whole game still feels a bit too familiar. It does make substantial improvements to the formula that the first game established, but it all feels expected. Forbidden West really doesn’t push any boundaries, especially when compared to the rest of Sony’s first-party lineup. It’s just more Horizon, which is both an exciting and slightly disappointing prospect.Still, Horizon Forbidden West is a fantastic game that is really hard to put down. Even though it has a lot of stuff that we’ve seen before, clearing out bandit camps and finding collectibles is still a great time, especially in a world as beautiful and unique as this. It may not break much new ground, but the rest of 2022’s games already have some serious competition to live up to. Horizon Forbidden West is a bigger, better game than the original in nearly every way. With tons of engaging side content, a wide array of beautiful biomes to explore, and multiple threatening new machines to take on, there’s a lot to see and do in the Forbidden West.This game was reviewed using a copy of the game provided by the game's publisher,public relations company, developer or other for the express purpose of a review.

Horizon Forbidden West,Josh Wise,VideoGamer,https://www.videogamer.com/reviews/horizon-forbidden-west-review/," Posted in Reviews
Horizon Forbidden West is the sequel to Horizon Zero Dawn, which was released in 2017. We spend the new game, as we did the first, in the company of Aloy, who is played by Ashley Burch. Over four years on, it’s tiring company. Burch still delivers many of her lines in a harried whisper, hinting at the gruelling weight bearing down on our heroine. “The burden of your task is written across your face,” one character says, and he’s not wrong. What is this burden? Aloy herself sums it up thusly: “Everything dies unless I succeed.” Fair enough. Still, you would think that her load would be somewhat lightened by the prospect of riding a mechanical velociraptor, as she does in the course of her adventure. But no. Even up there, perched amidst the creature’s steel feathers, her spirits fail to take flight.The crux of these open-world games is that life on Earth has both leaped ahead and lapsed into rubble. Society has been razed—by forces not so much unknown as intricately uninteresting—and toyish robotic beasts prowl the shells of cities, as though our doom were like data, to be sniffed on the breeze. This is apocalypse, Hasbro-style. More than Nintendo and Microsoft, Sony has catered to our odd, unslakable hunger to witness, and play through, our own ruination. We have the elegiacally zombified variety, dished up by Days Gone and The Last of Us. Then there is Resistance and Bloodborne, wherein monsters besiege us from the cosmos and brew within our veins. And, more recently, Death Stranding, in which we wobble drearily on the rim of extinction, cheered only by the sight of Norman Reedus’s abs, as he steps out of a steamy shower cubicle.His journey, in that game, was a westward trek, with the aim of repairing a splintered America by hooking it up to high-speed internet: the pioneer trudge, retrodden with the promise of an unlimited monthly package. Likewise, Aloy, as befits the title of her game, must go west. In fact, she, too, is plugging something back in. An A.I., called GAIA, is missing chunks of its former self, which have spun off and forged their own fiefdoms. In order to prune back the surge of a scarlet vine, whose poisonous tendrils have crept across the land, Aloy must gather up these so-called subordinate functions—DEMETER, POSEIDON, and HEPHAESTUS—and restore GAIA’s ability to govern the ecological balance. This mission takes her, ultimately, to the baked crust of San Francisco. Typical. You have a Dutch developer, owned by a Japanese company, and the salvation of all mankind is achieved how? By heading to Silicon Valley and hoping for a software upgrade.There are further complications. America is carved up and tussled over by various tribes, and the Forbidden West is home to the Tenakth, who bedeck their bodies with torn-off hunks of machine. “As you may have noticed, violence is the native tongue of the Tenakth,” someone warns us. “To survive, one must master it.” This will come as good news to fans of the previous game, who will flock to this one already fluent. Ranged against Aloy are certain factions of the Tenakth, and, more entertaining by far, a menagerie of metal animals. Along with returning favourites, there are plenty of new additions, such as the Tideripper, a kind of plesiosaur; the Sunwing, an environmentally friendly update on the pteranodon which flaps and glides on stretchy solar panels; and the monkeyish Clamberjaw—no mate has ever been more prime.You are free to approach these skirmishes as you see fit. My preferred tactic was to hang back and scan my quarry, heeding its weak points and rustling up explosive traps and tripwires to ensnare the poor thing. (Special mention has to be made of the Acid Blast Trap, which spews guacamole-hued gloop all over your foe, chewing through its armoured hide with a pleasing hiss.) If you would rather get up close and personal, you will find Aloy fitted with a few more melee options. Her trademark spear can now be charged, using her nifty new combos, until its shaft blushes with blue light, ready to unleash a super-powered swing. Plus, she now boasts a grappling hook, though, like Master Chief in Halo Infinite, no actual boasting will be done; like fashionistas suspecting a fad, Aloy and the Chief clearly resisted the gizmo until it passed into the realm of the passé, before quietly adopting it and wielding it with éclat.I was always surprised at how compelling the combat is in this series. Not least because your enemies look capable of not much more than inflicting a really nasty bruise on the arch of your foot, as you clomped on them in the night. But the clashes in Horizon Forbidden West are like miniature versions of the terrain-chewing bouts of Monster Hunter. They gain a narrative momentum, as you retreat, set traps, and sally forth. This being an action-R.P.G., you will find the menus laid out with main and optional quests, with a grove of upgrade trees for the cultivation of a personal strategy.Before making Horizon Zero Dawn, the developer, Guerilla Games, was known principally for the Killzone series, an array of military shooters in which dark-clad invaders, with eyes like orange headlamps, battled dour marines under skies as bright as concrete. Hence the explosion of colour that attended Aloy’s first outing—all damp sap greens, and clouds smeared in yolky daybreak. It resembled an advert for TVs with high dynamic range. With Horizon Forbidden West, Guerilla is armed with the grunt of the PlayStation 5 (though the game is also out on PlayStation 4), and we get not just a catalogue of alluring tones but a richer palette of ideas. One of those pesky A.I. fragments takes after Frank Sinatra and hides out in Las Vegas. Only, the place is submerged in an underground sea, with Tiderippers drifting by the sunken tables like would-be high rollers. It turns out that Vegas took some notes from Andrew Ryan and clasped its lights in glass. When Aloy drains one such dome, boots up a dormant casino and ascends into a hot desert night, she finds the dunes flooded with the holographic ghosts of long-gone attractions—a mirage of the Mirage!—shimmering on from here to eternity.In the wake of imagery like that, who needs a plot? I have to confess: the story of these games has never grabbed me. Partly, this is because combing through reams of matted lore in an effort to uncover the origins of its cybernetic bestiary always felt foolish; one look at a Tallneck, at the proud white plates that adorn the lofty black curve of its spine, and it’s clear that the man to blame is Mark Cerny. And partly it’s because the stern and steely impatience of our tour guide seems to rub off on me. Aloy has the pissed-off air of an I.T. support technician, summoned to solve uninteresting problems. When one character talks, with wide eyes, about lost and forbidden knowledge, Aloy is quick to cut her down: “Not lost. Not forbidden. Just a newer format,” she says, prescribing an updated dongle.It’s little wonder that no one in Horizon Forbidden West, not even her allies, can draw close to her. The one person who would really get Aloy isn’t even in her game; that would be the Link of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, which came out the same year as her debut. He, too, was out of his time; roused from a watery slumber, he slogged out into a broken world with the aid not of a Bluetooth earpiece, as favoured by Aloy, but of a tablet PC. Despite pitching in to help, the pair of them seem to float above the troubles of ordinary folk, borne aloft by destiny or mild boredom. In her new game, Aloy even pays homage to Link’s paraglider, gripping a crackling laser umbrella as it wafts her off over the horizon. Everything may die unless she succeeds, but the burden of her task, for a few moments, has lifted.Developer: Guerilla GamesPublisher: Sony Interactive EntertainmentAvailable on: PlayStation 5 [reviewed on], PlayStation 4Release Date: February 18, 2022To check what a review score means from us, click here.

Horizon Forbidden West,Dean Takahashi,GamesBeat,https://venturebeat.com/2022/03/11/the-deanbeat-why-flying-and-swimming-bring-the-world-of-horizon-forbidden-west-to-life/,"Connect with top gaming leaders in Los Angeles at GamesBeat Summit 2023 this May 22-23. Register here.I loved the story, open world, and battles of Horizon: Zero Dawn, the big PlayStation 4 hit from Sony’s Guerrilla Games. I wasn’t surprised at all that the title starring the woman character Aloy sold more than 20 million copies since its debut in 2017.Nor am I surprised that the sequel Horizon: Forbidden West is an outstanding game. I played through on the PlayStation 5 and finished the story after dozens of hours of play. And I was shocked to find that I had only completed about 30% of the content in the game after the credits rolled. I probably put a good 50 hours into it (my timer wasn’t accurate at 167 hours). I should have remembered that when I completed the first game I was only 32% of the way through the content.I enjoyed going into combat with the crazy and terrifying Machines of the post-post-apocalyptic world and uncovering the secrets of the complicated narrative. It was so tough to fight those machines with an underpowered Aloy in the early part of the game. But I also enjoyed leveling up and eventually domesticating those beasts and riding around on them or flying through the endless skies.As you see people say on social media, Horizon: Forbidden West is one of the prettiest games you’ll ever play, with the PS5’s graphics capability pushing out some amazing scenery as well as fast-action combat at the same time. GamesBeat Summit 2023Join the GamesBeat community in Los Angeles this May 22-23. You’ll hear from the brightest minds within the gaming industry to share their updates on the latest developments.I felt like some of the boss fights were very tough. If you haven’t leveled up much, it’s suicidal to go after some of the big Machines. But over time, if you do enough missions and side quests, you get stronger and get to allocate points to different characteristics and become more powerful or dexterous. It was very tough to fight bosses like Regalla if you hadn’t mastered a variety of types of combat, including running away.I dealt with bosses by shooting various types of arrows, planting traps, and engaging in melee combat as I could. Some of those boss fights seemed to last forever, like the boss fights I faced in Halo: Infinite. It felt so good to get through them when you were done. Even some of the side quests were very difficult. And that was very gratifying.By the end of the game, I had completed 17 main missions, eight side questions, and two errands. I had dispatched 262 machines (one by one, with some of them gigantic boss beasts) and 106 humans. It was exhausting and rewarding.The story remains one of the best sci-fi post-apocalyptic narratives I’ve seen that can sustain itself across such a long game. You don’t feel like you’re just playing a map game because the story takes you both into the past and the future as you try to unravel a mystery and, against all odds, try to save the entire world.I loved exploring the depth of the world through new mechanics like flying. After you fight Regalla’s henchman early in the game, you get a shield that you can use as a glider. The glider lets you jump off mountain peaks or tall buildings and float gently down to the ground. You can also gain access to some flying Machines late in the game and be able to call them anytime you want. By this time in the game, you will have unlocked a lot of Fast Travel links and so that helps you get around a lot. But flying is sometimes the best way to go into battle. I unlocked the Sunwing machine mount after upgrading so I could override the machine by ambushing them from behind.When you’re hoping to climb to the top of a Tallneck, a giant mechanical beast that can map an entire area for you, it is often easier to drop on top of the Tallneck by bailing out of a flying mount. I also used the flying mount a lot to battle some of the biggest beasts in the game. On the ground, those beasts cornered me and tore me apart. But when I had the flying mount, I could call it in, escape, ambush a beast from above, and then call the mount back in when I could. Aloy became so much more dangerous when she could attack from above. Swimming was also a joy. At some point in the story, you get access to a swimming mask and its accompanying oxygen source. That allows you to dive down into the depths for a long time, and you can explore an entire underwater city and fight with Machines underwater or hide from them. It was only by flying and swimming that I realized that the world of the first game was so much more limited than the one of the sequel. Just by unlocking these abilities, you realize that the world is really three dimensional, and you have so much more to explore in the world of Horizon: Forbidden West. Compared to the new game, the old world of Horizon’s first game seems so flat.I don’t have much to say on this front. I do feel that Aloy is very light on emotion this time around. She almost never appears vulnerable, and she has very little sympathy for Beta, a DNA-based version of herself, who becomes so easily discouraged. Aloy eventually comes around with the hugs and communicating on a human level. I can understand that the developers saw her as a strong warrior who had no patience for weakness. She doesn’t like attention or pomp, and she hates anything that slows her down.But the storytellers ran the risk of turning her into a robot when she faced so much misery in the world around her. I did appreciate it when the narrative took some different twists that revealed more shades of Aloy’s character and her vulnerabilities. But I don’t consider the character design to be flawed.I had some rare crashes while playing, but it was so easy to start back up and return to where I was that this wasn’t a problem. I only found one side quest that I wasn’t able to finish. I made it through each part of the Shadow of the West side quest until I reached the final boss and his annoying machine. It took me a while to get competitive in that fight, but then the game kicked me outside of the chamber where the boss fight took place. The door was red instead of blue, and I had no way to get back into the chamber. I went back numerous times, and it never reset.As the story took its various twists and turns and led toward its conclusion, I went into the final campaign cold. I had not leveled up some of the all-important weapon types and figured I could get through it. But it turned out that some of the new enemies I faced were vulnerable only to a certain type of weapon that I didn’t have. I made it all the way through to the final boss fight of the game, but I couldn’t win it with the weapons that I carried. So I restarted a previous saved game and purchased the gear I needed and leveled up. Then I went back into the entire endgame, and it went much more smoothly. The final battle was still difficult, but I beat it on my third try.I’ve seen a lot of people say they have skipped Horizon: Forbidden West to play other games like Gran Turismo 7 and Elden Ring. I’m in the middle of Elden Ring now, and I feel like I have my training wheels on. But I wouldn’t skip Horizon: Forbidden West, as I feel like this is going to be one of the best games of 2021.Mike Minotti actually reviewed the game for us.

Horizon Forbidden West,Mike Minotti,GamesBeat,https://venturebeat.com/2022/02/14/horizon-forbidden-west-review-in-progress-a-lot-of-aloy/,"Connect with top gaming leaders in Los Angeles at GamesBeat Summit 2023 this May 22-23. Register here.Some people criticize some of my favorite open world games by saying that they “feel empty.” It’s a complaint they levy against the likes of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Pokémon Legends: Arceus. I never mind the open spaces. I enjoy doing a bit traveling and exploration.But if you’re one of those people, then Horizon: Forbidden West is the antithesis of a “feels empty” open world game. This sequel from Guerrilla Games comes out on February 18 for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 (Sony gave me a PS5 code for this review). It’s one of Sony’s biggest exclusives since the launch of the PS5. And “big” is the operative word here.In fact, it’s so big, I didn’t even get all that close to beating the game in time for the review embargo. Maybe if I had rushed through the story missions, I could have gotten there. But Forbidden West excels at making you want to see all of the extra activities.In that respect, it reminds me of The Witcher III. Side quests don’t feel inherently “less” than the ones from the main story. The side missions expand on the world and characters, often ones the main scenario introduces you. GamesBeat Summit 2023Join the GamesBeat community in Los Angeles this May 22-23. You’ll hear from the brightest minds within the gaming industry to share their updates on the latest developments.They also offer beefy rewards. Yes, Forbidden West has a traditional level up and skill tree points progression system. I like that you often earn points directly for completing a mission or side activity. That’s a pretty tangible reward, and it makes it worthwhile and fun to check out all of those icons on your map.Ah, yes. Icons on maps. Forbidden West is what I like to call a “map game.” It’s a certain flavor of open world gaming where you’re constantly opening that map, setting a waypoint to the nearest activity, and then you start knocking them out like they’re items on a to-do list. If you ever played an Ubisoft game, especially the Far Cry series, you know what I’m talking about.Sometimes, map games can feel tedious. It’s like you’re completing chores. Content is so dense that you never have a chance to actually explore. And while that latter point may still hold true for Forbidden West, the core gameplay and the quality of these map activities are fun enough that I don’t mind.Especially when it involves combat. Fighting feels great in Horizon: Forbidden West, especially if you focus on ranged attacks with your bow. Yes, you can opt for a sneakier approach, and you usually want to pick off a few enemies with traps and stealth attacks. But usually, things will devolve into a brawl, and I enjoy the hectic action. I’m dodging out of the way of charging enemies and aiming my bow at specific body parts either to exploit weaknesses or to give me some extra crafting materials.You also have a couple of cooldown abilities that you earn in the skill tree. While in, say, Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla, these attacks dominate combat, they take more of a backseat here. That’s a good thing. Combat is more about the basics — combos, stealth, aiming — and less about spamming abilities.As much as I enjoy the combat, traversal can feel a bit stiff. I know how much you all love when we compare games to Breath of the Wild, so here we go! Breath of the Wild popularized the “if you see it, you can go there” approach to open world games. Sometimes, Forbidden West will straight up tell you with a text box that you can’t do progress further in the area you’re in until you unlock an ability later in the game.That feels bad, especially when you already dedicated some time to explore an old ruin, getting excited about what may be inside, only to learn that you have no choice but to give up and come back later.Aloy’s movement can sometimes feel as restrictive as the exploration. You have to do a lot of Uncharted-style climbing, and it sometimes isn’t clear what you can and can’t grab onto to. You can press a button to highlight what edges you climb on. That helps, but it’s also weird. It can feel like the game arbitrarily decides which parts of a cliff or building you can latch onto. You see the hand of the game designer here, drawing paths for you to traverse, when I’d rather have better and freer traversal tools that give me more options.Even Aloy’s tools can feel underwhelming. Early in the game, you get a kind of grappling claw. You’d think this would open up a lot of traversal possibilities, but you can only use it on a select few spots. It’s mostly used to knock down walls or to zip yourself up to specific (and sparse) hook points. Later, you get a glider (yes, once again, like Breath of the Wild), but it’s slow and falls fast.Honestly, those issues present moments of frustration, but I get over them quickly. I enjoy the game’s world — which is colorful, vibrant, and full of detail. I like its casts of characters, and Aloy is an interesting protagonist (even if her stubbornness and difficulty accepting help — her defining character flaws — sometimes feel illogically extreme).And if you’re a fan of lore, you have plenty of that absorb here. The world of Horizon takes place centuries after an apocalyptic event on Earth, which gives the game its signature blend of sci-fi and prehistoric sensibilities. It’s fun learning more about the downfall of the old world while searching for ways to save the new one.Technical issues can sometimes be a drag, although you do expect some of those with any open world game. I will say, I find Aloy’s hair physically more distracting than anything. These long strands flail about at the slightest tilt of her head, often clipping through her armor and weapons. I have to stop myself from staring at her hair — and losing focus on the actual story — during those cutscenes closeups.I also had Aloy get stuck in a T-pose during a boss fight. That was a bummer. It was a dramatic encounter, and I was doing well, but then she just sort of got stuck, and I couldn’t make her budge. I could do nothing but wait for the boss to kill me, so I could try again.But, again, those are minor annoyances. Overall, Forbidden West is an impressive, huge game.Anyone who digs these kinds of dense, map-based, open world experiences is going to feel happy with what Guerrilla Games is offering here. This is something you could spend a lot of time with, first enjoying the story, then going out of your way to see and complete every last bit of content.Once I see the story to its end, I’ll be able to settle on a score. But if you’re just looking for a recommendation, consider it given.Horizon: Forbidden West is out on February 18 for PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4.

Genre: Action/adventureHorizon Forbidden West doesn't try to reinvent the proverbial wheel with new gameplay mechanics or a controversial story. It is a true sequel to Horizon Zero Dawn, delivering more of what made the first game successful. This is a double-edged sword, of course. Series fans will delight in seeing protagonist Aloy fighting against both man and machine during her quest to save the planet. However, those who weren’t impressed with the original installment will find little to sway them in this new entry.While there were moments during my playthrough when I wanted to see the gameplay and narrative do something truly unexpected, I was having too much fun to dwell on Forbidden West’s shortcomings. The game focuses on giving action/adventure fans a rousing and enjoyable experience. In that respect, Forbidden West prevails.This title has everything I look for in open-world games: a large map full of unique environments, meaningful side quests and loads of collectibles. It also has an engaging narrative that ties all the disparate gameplay elements into a cohesive whole. It’s too early to consider Forbidden West as a Game of the Year candidate, but it’s one of the most entertaining titles I’ve played so far in 2022. Even if Horizon Forbidden West isn’t a true “next-gen” title, as it's also available on PS4, it’s still an all-around gripping experience.Read on for our full Horizon Forbidden West review.Horizon Forbidden West takes place about six months after the conclusion of Horizon Zero Dawn. Even though that story had a definite conclusion, the world remains in peril. The terraforming process that gave life to the post-apocalyptic land continues to malfunction, causing plant life to wither and rot. This spells doom for the humans and animals who already have a hard time surviving in a world overrun by killer robots (called ""machines"" in-game). As before, Aloy and her allies must do what they can to save the planet.Because so little time has passed between the events of Forbidden West and Zero Dawn, the story initially feels like a continuation of the previous adventure. Eventually, the narrative expands, and a new threat emerges to takes things in an interesting direction. I won’t spoil things here, but it’s a clever bit of plotting that expands on a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it piece of worldbuilding from the first title.Speaking of worldbuilding, the various side quests and errands do a great job of making the primitive-future world of Forbidden West feel authentic. Side quests tend to tell self-contained stories, but also add to the larger narrative tapestry. Whereas some games have side content that feels superfluous, Forbidden West’s optional quests feel like natural extensions of the main plot. Even traditional fetch quests and collectible hunts tell miniature stories. It's worth your time to complete them, especially since you'll earn rewards, such as items and experience points.Open world games often fall prey to meandering campaigns. While there is an element of that in Forbidden West, the core plot remains fairly focused and follows a typical three-act structure. If you simply stick to the critical path, you’ll experience an entertaining and cinematic story, on a par with the likes of Ghost of Tsushima, Marvel's Spider-Man and God of War. While the narrative doesn’t take many risks, it is exceptionally well-told. I don’t foresee people having major complaints about Forbidden West's overall structure.Horizon Forbidden West has the standard gameplay trifecta for an action/adventure title: combat, platforming and puzzles. The latter element isn’t as prevalent, but you’ll get heaping doses of the former two. Sprinkle in some light stealth mechanics, and you’ve got a slew of gameplay elements that keep you engaged with sheer variety. You’ll never get bogged down in one particular activity for long, which is great.You’ll fight most enemies from a distance using specialized bows and arrows. Other weapons, such as the Ropecaster and Slingcaster round out your arsenal. If machines get too close for comfort, you can fight them off with your spear, which you also use to override and control machines.Battling machines can get pretty intense. Perhaps my memory is fuzzy, but I don’t recall robots being this aggressive in the previous title. To survive, you’ll need to land attacks in-between dodges, or otherwise use the environment for cover. Each machine has weak spots, or is susceptible to certain elemental attacks. Scanning robots for said weakness prior to an engagement is essential. Focusing attacks on specific parts ensures you’re not stuck in long engagements. Considering the ferocity that the machines display, you’ll want to end battles as quickly as possible.As the game progresses, you’ll either buy or find upgraded weapons and armor. You can upgrade your current gear at workbenches in villages or shelters scattered across the map. Upgrading equipment is a straightforward process. So long as you have the requisite materials for an upgrade, you’re golden. Thankfully, the game has a feature that shows you where to find whichever parts you need on the map. This way, you can make a beeline to a herd of machines, or a cluster of plants, to retrieve the necessary crafting items. I’m normally not a fan of crafting in games, but Forbidden West includes it in a relatively unobtrusive manner. Plus, upgrading equipment keeps you alive longer, so it’s in your best interest to upgrade often.Battling foes and completing missions earn you experience points. You’ll gain skill points whenever you reach a new level. Finishing quests can also net you skill points. The skill tree has an extensive amount of unlockable skills, focusing on different areas of gameplay. Warrior skills make you more effective at close-range combat, while Hunter skills add new bow-and-arrow abilities, for example.Each skill tree has Valor abilities, which are effectively super-moves-. For example, initiating a Hunter Valor skill increases your chances of landing critical strikes with ranged weapons. Using an Infiltrator Valor skill will temporarily render you invisible to all enemies. The Valor meter fills up relatively fast, which encourages you to -use whatever skill you’ve enabled frequently.It’s easy to develop an Aloy that suits your particular playstyle. Like using smoke bombs and explosives? Then drop some points into Trapper skills. Want to give yourself more health and elemental resistance? The Survivor tree will keep you in the proverbial game for longer. Of course, you can also do what I did, and unlock a balanced number of skills across all branches. The choice is yours.There's no shortage of places to climb or otherwise traverse in Horizon Forbidden West. Aloy’s Focus (a small device she wears close to her right ear) highlights handholds and ledges you can use to surmount natural and manmade structures. Scaling tall mountains with the new grapple hook or jumping between steel beams is fluid for the most part. You’re never truly in danger of falling, but the platforming sections are a welcome respite from combat. You’ll also do plenty of climbing and jumping when scouring areas for out-of-the-way loot. As such, it’s good that platforming is as just as fun in Forbidden West as it is in Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection.The map is stuffed with a bevy of optional content. In addition to the aforementioned story-focused side quests and collectibles, you’ll also find challenges in and around most of the main villages. These include archery challenges, machine hunts, wrestling matches (with weapons) and even an in-depth board game. One of the larger villages has an arena where you’ll go up against machines in gladiatorial matches. Some of these encounters can be more brutal than anything you’ll encounter in a mission or out in the wild. But if you want to earn the very best gear Forbidden West has to offer, this fighting arena is the place to go.There are even more activities Forbidden West has to offer, but I don’t want to spoil all the goodies you’ll find. Suffice it to say, there’s a lot to see and do in this game.Horizon Forbidden West, like its predecessor, is a visual powerhouse. I played the PS5 version, and was blown away by the graphical presentation. Everything from dense forests, barren deserts, towering mountains, humid swamps and old-world ruins come to life in exquisite detail. There were many moments when I stopped to let myself appreciate whatever environment I was currently exploring. Humans and machines also have an impressive amount of detail — especially the latter.On PS5, you’ll find two visual modes. Quality mode delivers 4K resolution with “full graphical settings” at 30 frames per second. Performance mode runs at a variable resolution and at 60 frames per second.While Quality mode looks crisper and does an excellent job of removing jagged edges via anti-aliasing, I opted to play in Performance mode. Having Forbidden West running at a (mostly) smooth 60 fps during both gameplay and cinematic scenes more than made up for any losses in resolution or visual effects (most of which I found imperceptible anyway). But whichever mode you decide to play on, you're in for a visual feast.The music does a good job of immersing you without ever drawing too much attention to itself. Most of the soundtrack consists of tribal-like music you’d expect from a world where humans live in primitive, almost-Stone-Age societies. But given the sci-fi nature of Forbidden West, there’s a good helping of synthetic sounds that jell well with the tribal percussion. One of my colleagues also loved how well Horizon Forbidden West incorporates the PS5's DualSense's haptic feedback — in fact, he fell back in love with the controller.Horizon Forbidden West is a slam dunk for PlayStation users. While it's not a revolutionary game, it delivers a solidly crafted experience that most players will fall in love with. It’s hard to knock a game for giving people exactly what they want. Also, it’s a relief to get an open-world experience that doesn’t completely exhaust you with extraneous content. The fact I want to continue playing this game, despite having finished this review, speaks volumes. It's a blast.If you own a PS4 or a PS5, you can't go wrong with Horizon Forbidden West.

Me, a game critic who has played this game to its conclusion and feels obliged to report on it, and you, a player with an itch to sate your curiosity and be convinced. So let me earn my keep and get this over with so you can go spend your $80 and start having fun. For those not in the know, Forbidden West is Guerrilla Games’ PlayStation-exclusive (PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5) follow-up to 2017’s Horizon Zero Dawn, a sci-fi open world romp that became an instant sensation. Here’s a quick recap to get us all up to speed. Sometime in the 2060s machines wiped out all biomass on Earth, leaving it a lifeless rock. A genius named Elisabet Sobeck — who saw the catastrophe happening in slow motion and, tragically, knew there was nothing that could stop it — created what you might call a backup for civilization. The machines would eliminate all life on Earth, but at some point in the distant future, when the threat was over, an AI designed by Sobeck named GAIA would reboot the biosphere, bringing back plants, animals, humans and a life-sustaining climate. Fast forward a millennium and presto: It worked! Sort of. The world is alive again, but animal-like machines roam the wilds, posing a constant threat. Plus, much of humanity’s knowledge was lost, so the newly minted people exist in primitive tribes with no understanding of what came before. Except our hero, Aloy. A physical clone of the Sobeck, she gradually learns the planet’s history, discovers that another catastrophe is fast approaching, and, of course averts it. That’s all you need to know heading into Forbidden West. The sequel opens with Aloy revered as a saviour by the people she helped. But she soon learns that there’s another apocalypse-scale disaster mere months away. The answers she seeks are in the titular lands to the west of where she grew up — basically Nevada and California — which few of her people have ventured into due to the notoriously aggressive tribes that inhabit this area. Much like the original, a huge part of the fun comes from shocking plot twists and perspective-shattering revelations, so there’s not much more I feel safe revealing in a review published nearly a week before launch. Suffice to say we get to spend more time with many characters from the original — like the mildly bumbling, beer-swilling, hulking-but-humble brute Erend, who is as lovable as ever — meet a memorable set of new personalities — including the sweet-natured Alva, our first glimpse at someone from beyond America — and learn plenty more about the days leading up to humanity’s extinction, including some speculative commentary on climate change, the American political divide and the consequences of corporate egoism and greed without oversight. It’s bold and compelling stuff. I’m also shy to expound much on the world itself, which is an absolute pleasure to explore. The topography is hugely varied and brilliantly crafted to make the free-to-roam wilds feel vast and boundless, even as you inevitably bump up against its edges. More than that, though, it’s simply beautiful. Deserts and oases, mountains and valleys, towering redwoods and emerald green lakes, sandy beaches and roiling oceans all sit under a sky that shifts from cloudy blue afternoons to crimson sunsets to spectacularly starry nights. Light spears through treetops and lights up grassy, flowery knolls like something out of a grand fantasy painting. I’m not one to make much use of photo modes, but I was so taken with this world that I stopped to capture dozens of screenshots so that I could continue to enjoy Forbidden West‘s vistas beyond the game as desktops and screensavers. Combat is pretty jaw-dropping, too. The machines — based on birds, dinosaurs, mammals, and more — are feats of artistic imagination composed of myriad metal pieces and dazzling lights. They move with a speed and fluidity we normally don’t see even in video game animals and believably alter their complex behaviours as we methodically strip them of armour plates, weapons and key components we can collect and use for crafting. These dynamic behaviours also force us to think strategically. Much like the original, we have seemingly endless options in how we take on each machine we face. Beyond tactically shearing off components, we can use element-charged tripwires to weaken their defences and slow them down, briefly bind them to the ground with anchored ropes (especially useful for encounters with winged foes), throw javelins with timed explosives into exposed weak spots, or override machines to make them attack their allies. Learning the rhythms and attacks of the dozens of different machines you face and figuring out effective means to dispatch each helps ensure combat never grows dull. Nor does traversing the world. Each hill we crest and valley we cross leads to new wonders and mysteries. You’ll investigate 1,000-year-old ruins filled with puzzles to find treasure troves of valuables, embark on epic ascents of mountains and ruined skyscrapers to discover tantalizing fragments of ancient knowledge, and dive into the crystal clear waters (yes, Aloy can swim now) of forgotten caverns to hunt for valuable elements. The powerful sense of wonder and discovery that comes with exploration kept me playing hours past my bedtime night after night. When you need a break from wandering you can stop in one of many villages and settlements to play a few rounds of Strike, a strategy board game with collectable pieces modelled after the machine animals. It’s not quite as addictive as The Witcher 3‘s Gwent, which eventually got its own standalone game, but it’s not far off, forcing players to carefully consider each piece’s capabilities and the terrain of the board in order to best some of the better players you’ll encounter. But as entertaining as all these activities are, the main reason Horizon Forbidden West has had an iron grip on my attention for nearly 90 hours over the last couple of weeks is Aloy. I am fully invested in her. Ashly Burch — whom you might recognize as one of the game testers in the Apple TV+ sitcom Mythic Quest — reprised the role, providing both voice and performance capture, and she serves as an emotional anchor for the entire narrative. In Burch’s hands Aloy is endlessly capable yet quietly vulnerable, feeling the weight of the world on her shoulders as she believes herself the only person who can stop the coming calamity. For all her cool outward confidence she harbours a hidden self-doubt that only the logic of a machine mind seems capable of calming. She grows subtly but substantially in this entry, beginning in self-imposed mental isolation before gradually coming to realize some things can only be done with the help of friends. And she’s surrounded by a gifted supporting cast, including: a bombastic Angela Bassett as Regalla, one of the game’s fiercest antagonists; Lance Reddick, who returns as the cold and cryptic knowledge seeker Sylens; and Canada’s own Carrie-Anne Moss, who plays a character I won’t discuss here but whose calm delivery of momentous lines makes her deliciously difficult to parse. Working with a script from a team helmed by Ben McCaw — who also wrote the first game — that takes time to develop depth and relatability for each main character, including some of the “bad” guys, the actors breathe life into the sumptuous digital domain created by Guerrilla’s coders and artists. This combination of human emotion and technical acumen has resulted in an amazing feat of world building on par with some of the greatest interactive stories around. Now, after such unabashed praise, this is where I suppose I ought to take a moment to point out that it’s not a flawless game. Of course it’s not. Some evidence follows. I hit the level cap — 50 — some 30 hours before finishing the story. Granted, I made a point of doing just about every side quest and errand I could find, and there were still loads of passive and active skills to unlock plus weapons and armour to earn and upgrade, so the sense of growth continued. But experience points earned from completing missions and defeating enemies just sort of float away once you hit that top level, which can be a little disheartening. Climbing mechanics need a bit more work, too. Aloy’s ascents up sheer cliffs can be frustrating as she sometimes won’t move to handholds that seem within reach or occasionally gets stuck in architecture (though it’s worth adding that such glitches were surprisingly rare for an open world game of this scope, especially after I installed the launch day patch). And, like most non-linear games in which we’re provided a range of activities beyond the main story, there are times when, should you take a moment to stop and think, you’ll realize how odd it is that Aloy might pause to help someone hunt for a random old world relic or help track down a meandering machine when the end of the world is nigh. I’m not sure anyone making open world games has figured out how to get around this particular narrative conundrum, though. None of these issues, however, ever topple Horizon Forbidden West‘s magical awe. I lost myself in its fantastical world and the plights of its people, feeling a sense of urgency and purpose that I seldom experience in games, a need to see and learn more. Pair that with combat intense enough to cause real trepidation but so rich and complex that I never stopped craving it, and the result is a game that I didn’t want to see end. But, after one final shocking twist that clearly sets up a third (perhaps final?) instalment in the Horizon series, end it does. And it closes with one of the most satisfying credits sequences I’ve encountered in all my long years playing games, one that called up memories of just about everything I’d experienced playing over the last couple of weeks. I suspect it may be even more resonant for casual players who absorb the game over a much longer stretch, allowing each mission and location to settle a little deeper into their psyche. If you’ve read this far, hopefully you don’t feel too spoiled. If you’ve simply scrolled down for a conclusion, the TL;DR is that Horizon Forbidden West is the first absolutely essential PlayStation 5 experience I’ve encountered. Have no fear laying down your hard-earned money. Simply put, this one is special.

Horizon Forbidden West,David Burdette,GamingTrend,https://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/horizon-forbidden-west-review-a-monumental-step-into-the-future/,"Ever feel like you are alone in the world? How about that you knew everything going on, but no one else could help? This is kind of what happened in Horizon Zero Dawn, where our heroine Aloy grows up an outcast in a post-apocalyptic world, but upon finding a piece of old world technology is launched into a grand mission to not only discover who she is, but her importance to the survival of the Earth. After the battle of Meridian, where Aloy hopes she’s erased the threat to humanity, everything is still falling apart. There are storms, the robots are angrier than ever, a blight is consuming the land, and Earth seems to be on a crash course to destruction. In order to find a solution, Aloy has spent the last six months hunting down GAIA, the AI system built to restore the Earth after Ted Faro’s combat machines wiped out all life. There’s plenty going on here at the beginning of Horizon Forbidden West, but after watching the credits roll I couldn’t have been any happier with the direction Guerrilla games sophomore effort has gone, and it’s very easily an early contender for game of the year.Figuring out where to start with all of this, and of course, not spoiling anything, is certainly a challenge, but let’s have at it. As I mentioned, you start out in a quick tutorial type area with Varl from the original game as a companion. Let me preface with this, this is definitely not what you’ll be playing the entire game. While I know it’s similar to how the original game handled it, having a specific tutorial area, this is a bit off of the pace I expected when starting the game. Maybe it’s just me, but it didn’t work as well as I’d hoped. Then… I climbed a rocket ship and knocked it down to kill three giant robot snakes, and had to fight the one that survived the crash. Yeah, Horizon is absolutely crazy, and it only ups the ante from here.Jumping from this leads you into another closed off area, but this one is more about exposition than anything, allowing you to chat with people from the first game to hear about what’s been happening in their lives. Of course, you don’t get to stick around. You just found out that Hades isn’t actually dead from your boss battle in the previous game, given that Sylens (played by Lance Reddick) gave you a lance he intentionally designed as an antenna in order to beam Hades to him. It’s time to go to the Forbidden West and track him down, with the side benefit of destroying Hades as well as hopefully finding that copy of GAIA we mentioned earlier.At least, that’s what I was supposed to be doing. Horizon Forbidden West is massive, and even at the start of the open world map known as The Daunt, you’ll find yourself wanting to go after every icon on the mini-map. The hilarious thing for me was that I spent seven hours doing most everything there, and it’s a tiny part of the map, maybe an 8th to 10th of the full scope of the larger world. The reason it’s so easy to get locked into trying to do all these things lies in the gameplay, along with incredibly well designed side missions and objectives that keep you invested.The thing about video games, you’re not generally going to do something the other guy hasn’t already done, especially in the open world action-adventure space. We saw that in Horizon Zero Dawn, where plenty of mechanics were borrowed from other games. That being said, it all works if you perfect or make those your own, and Horizon Forbidden West doesn’t mess with an already great formula, instead improving on what they’ve already made fantastic. The example I always like to use is how we’ve all gotten tired of climbing towers and using them to show us what there is to do in a region, but Horizon took the same idea and made it a brontosaurus type dinosaur named the Tallneck. Even further, it’s not enough just to climb it, you’ve got to figure out how to make it onto the big guy in order to hack him and reveal all the map – the creature itself is the puzzle. Taking something and making it feel fresh is something Horizon constantly does, and it’s certainly a big part of Horizon Forbidden West.This continues on with the weaponry, and honestly, they didn’t do much to it. Even with that being the case though, I find this more not fixing what isn’t broken. Using all of the things available, like the bow or the sling feel great, but they felt great in Zero Dawn. I don’t think they had to do much to tweak these, because they already worked so well, though the lock-on mechanic is a welcome one. The same with crafting on the fly, with the weapon wheel still being super easy to use. Those things, along with the Pokemon-esque system of using specific types of ammo on specific creatures works amazing, so there’s no need to tinker. I know I have a more definitive playstyle with the bows, and the freedom Horizon gives you in equipping weapons allows you to choose the type of Aloy you’re going to be. Want to be more stealthy? Use the tripcaster and traps. Plan to take them head on? The sling and bow are going to be your best friends. Being able to do anything in a game certainly makes it fun, and it also keeps you in it because you want to try new things.Guerrilla has also pushed to make your melee attack a lot more potent, and their efforts have mostly paid off. Melee is still going to generally be your last resort play, and for good reason, they’re not pushing you to make a melee built character. But melee is now a lot more viable thanks to both upping the speed, as well as adding a few combos to unlock. There aren’t many, but they do in a pinch, and using them charges your staff to energize them with a resonator charge you can shoot at with your bow for a nice extra bit of damage.While there isn’t much new on the weapons front (although I do love my throwable exploding spear), three new pieces of equipment do give some additional agility to maneuver around the map. Given the wonderful mix of verticality thrown in, the pullcaster and the energy shield turned glider are a boon to your getting around quickly, as well as escaping in dire moments. Being able to use the pullcaster to grapple up to a ledge can save you from an untimely death to a monster dino you somehow missed with your focus, the same with being able to jump off a cliff and glide to safety. While it’s not new, another huge design change has been making the sides of hills/mountains more scalable, with handholds that aren’t just yellow jutting pieces for you to find. It’s not a Breath of the Wild level of being able to climb everything, but it’s definitely a huge step up from Zero Dawn, and it helps with accessibility for those who need it.The last piece of equipment is the diving mask, and it changes the game exponentially once you get it. Forbidden West can feel a bit like a metroidvania in that respect, with sections in The Daunt walled off from exploration because of these missing pieces. That in perspective, the handling of underwater adventuring is positive, even if combat is non-existent. The story mission where you’re hunting for more of GAIA (I’ll keep it brief to let you have fun with it for yourself), is mostly how I’d want anything underwater approached. Water levels are generally disliked (looking at you Water Temple), but Guerrilla’s design being enjoyable elevates it. In all fairness, all they had to do was make me not hate it and it would be a win.As for upgrading yourself and your arsenal, you’ll spend a lot of time collecting things in the world and gaining skill points from completing activities, just like Zero Dawn. There are a few things I really like here, and I’ll start with the expanded skill tree. There are 162 skills on a tree that reminds you of the constellations from Skyrim, dividing them into six different categories. It really depends on how you want to play the game, but in any case you have the opportunity to earn plenty of points relatively quickly, although when I rolled the credits I’d only earned 69 of the 162. Included in these are the valor abilities, which are more or less a cool special move that gives you a boost in tight spots. I can’t say I used them much, but occasionally in a boss fight Ranged Master would come in handy to add extra damage on my bow shots.Besides this, you’ll be crafting away at workbenches after collecting the things you need. The good news in Forbidden West, there is a stash system now, and even better it automatically takes in the things you collect past your carry limit. All you have to do is run by it and click a button to restock, and it’s now a feature I’ll demand in open world games. Moving into crafting, unlocking new levels on weapons and outfits allows better stats, but also opens slots for coils (which were in the last game) and perks for the weapon. For instance, the Pyre Hunter Bow I have shoots fire arrows, but upgrading it added 10% burning enemy damage. It’s the little things that count, and Guerrilla has done a stupendous job refining what was already great into something fantastic.Of course, the equipment and skills allow you to do a ton in this world, and explore each of these incredible environments. There’s the beachside aura of the Golden Gate Bridge, the sandy plains of future Las Vegas, the quiet forests of what I assume is Oregon, all blending together in a magnificent juxtaposition of our modern world, and the ruined one we see before us. Zero Dawn did it well, but something about Forbidden West feels even bigger and more alive. I’m sure being able to take advantage of the PlayStation 5’s processing helps, but given this is a cross-gen title most of this is going to exist on PlayStation 4 as well. It’s just so well designed, with the beauty of the setting, the characters, the machines, and the wildlife so vibrant and inviting. That’s not to forget the incredible lighting either, which makes it all look so good.The environments are great, and what they house is even better. We all know why you’re buying Forbidden West, because you want to fight a bunch more of those insane robot dinosaurs. We found out in the first game that all of these creatures (I know they aren’t all dinos) have a purpose, being created by the Hephaestus function of GAIA to terraform the Earth for humanity. When GAIA exploded herself to keep a mysterious signal from causing everything to be wiped clean, all of these functions were thrown off into different areas and started doing their own thing, albeit in somewhat of a psycho way because they weren’t ever supposed to operate on their own. Well, there are even more in the world, along with your favorites from the first game like Watchers, Chargers, and of course our favorite, the Thunderjaw. Some are pretty simple, the Bristlebacks seem like ox-like animals, but they continue to grow more complex, like in your run-in with the Slitherfang. Before the end of the game you’ll fight multiple new boss creatures, and it’s amazing seeing the range and creativity Guerrilla brings to Forbidden West. I wasn’t sure how they’d outdo themselves in this area, but they did.Similarly, the different tribes and human enemies you encounter in Forbidden West have more range, enabling the world to be multi-dimensional. It somewhat reminds me of the factions in Fallout New Vegas, not everyone is going to want to kill you, and many will be looking for favors from you. I never encountered anyone friendly that I could tick off mind you, so you’ll know your enemies from your buddies, but some rendezvous won’t start cleanly. I am a bit disappointed in the missing ability to have to choose my friends and enemies, especially with decision making a part of dialogue, but I understand it’s harder for a writer to make a definitive narrative under those circumstances.With that in play, you’ll be handling a bunch of different side quests for plenty of different people, and it’s been handled with aplomb by Guerrilla. One of the criticisms Horizon Zero Dawn received was past the main characters and story, the things on the side were very… plastic. By that, I mean that the character models for side people were off, the voice acting seemed to be an afterthought, and there wasn’t any personality to it. Guerrilla seems like they took that to heart, because many of these quests I’ve encountered in the sequel have an energy that was missing from the original. This is especially present in the face capture, which aren’t a bunch of blank expressions, and with fantastic performances by the cast, such as Ashly Burch (Aloy), John MacMillan (Varl), and John Hopkins (Erend) . Not only have they outdone themselves in bringing the NPCs to life, but they feel personable and part of your adventure as opposed to a tacked on mission.This extra effort bleeds into everything. The care and passion poured into creating a cast that feels like living breathing people, not just NPCs. Talking with a random Utaru farmer whose convoy has been attacked by machines pulls an emotional response from you with his profuse thanks for saving their lives. There were moments like this in Horizon Zero Dawn, but it doesn’t compare to the thorough nature in Forbidden West. Another step up has been the more prevalent characters, with Erend, Varl, and the others you’ll befriend, feeling like the close companions they’re supposed to be. I’d have finished Forbidden West much quicker if I hadn’t spent so much time conversing with them at my base, and the dialogue has received major upgrades to leave you searching for moments to explore the backstory of the characters.Speaking of “finishing Forbidden West”, in the midst of running around doing all sorts of things, Guerrilla doesn’t skimp on your foremost assignment. The entire planet hangs in the balance, and the discoveries Aloy is going to make as you attempt to save everyone are going to blow you away. I thought what we found out in Zero Dawn was an insanely creative and entertaining story, but the revelations you get as you progress through the Forbidden West raise the stakes for everything and everyone. One thing is certain, Guerrilla doesn’t pull any punches. Every time I thought I was done reeling from one story beat, another would swoop in to make my jaw drop. It’s not just the shock factor either, each piece of the puzzle is extremely satisfying, and you’ll generally sit there wondering how in the world they came up with it. The final third of the game in particular is inconceivably packed with details, going from 0-60 with constant new discoveries. All that in the rearview, Horizon 3 is TOTALLY set up, so don’t worry about our favorite Nora warrior going anywhere.The campaign aside, there’s a bunch of different activities to do. Besides the obvious side missions, returning from Zero Dawn are things like Cauldrons, Hunting Grounds, Rebel Camps, and the like. In Forbidden West there’s a couple of other things like errands, salvage contracts, the melee pit, and others. One of the things I really like is the addition of being able to create jobs to do upgrades for your weapons or outfits. Remembering all the things necessary to improve what you’re working on can be tough, so adding a recipe system like this is appreciated. I put about 22-25 hours into my run of the campaign, so if you add everything else to the equation you’re probably looking at 50 hours minimum to do every little thing, and I’m sure plenty of people will end up with 80+ in.As per any review, I like to make sure and let you know if anything is a real issue. Honestly, the technical prowess of Guerrilla comes through nicely. The game runs extremely well in performance mode and quality, with largely minimal loading times. There were a few problems I did run into, but once the day one patch arrived for us last week those issues disappeared. You’ll still get some pop-in, but it’s much less pronounced.One last thing to talk about, the Dualsense and the wealth of accessibility. First with the controller, I like what Guerrilla has done, but it does feel like they played it safe in using the adaptive triggers. I bring up Kena: Bridge of Spirits a lot when it comes to how to handle a bow in a game, and Aloy’s just isn’t as intense as Kena’s. It still works well enough, and the haptic feedback is decent. Secondly with accessibility, the menu holds a fortune of adjustments you can utilize, from multiple controller presets, to auto-sprint, to ease of waypoints. Another huge benefit is co-pilot, allowing a second person to take the reins using a second controller to assist someone in playing what can be a complicated game.It’s not just that Horizon Forbidden West is bigger, it’s better. Guerrilla had already crafted an incredible title in Zero Dawn, but they’ve graduated into building an immaculate one in Forbidden West. Its strengths are taken to new heights, tuned to being the best they can be, and what were once weaknesses transform into pillars the series can build on. Besides a few minor technical issues, Horizon Forbidden West is the perfect example of what you want a sequel to an already great game to be, and it’s certainly a challenger for best game in 2022.—David BurdetteSee below for our list of partners and affiliates:One of the longest running independent gaming news, reviews and culture sites on the web.The thing that is magical about the Wizarding World isn’t the magic – it’s...by Ron BurkeThe world is going to end.

For those unfamiliar with the story of Horizon, a hunter of the Nora tribe, Aloy, must travel across the post-apocalyptic landscape of the United States to take down giant machines that nearly wiped out humanity a thousand years ago. Horizon Forbidden West will expand on the original setting and take players further along the coast through California and Nevada. The game is being released on 18 February 2022 on both the PS4 and PS5 consoles.Horizon Forbidden West will retail for £59.99 for the Playstation 4 version or £69.99 for the Playstation 5 version. Pre-orders are available from Playstation (£69.99, Playstation.co.uk), Amazon (£51.95, Amazon.co.uk), Argos (£69.99, Argos.co.uk) and Game (£69.99, Game.co.uk).Read on for our full review of the game.Read moreA copy of Horizon Forbidden West on the PS5 was provided to us by the game’s publisher. We spent over 30 hours with the game, playing through the story, side quests and wandering around its vast open world, before being trampled by a tremortusk.Rating: 9/10Horizon Forbidden West is set a thousand years into the future after a man-made mass extinction event leads to the near-destruction of all life on earth. Humanity survived but the loss of knowledge after a millennia meant the remaining human settlements reverted back to primitive tribalism as large, roaming machines became the new apex predators.The game follows Aloy, a hunter of the Nora tribe, six months after the events of the first game, Zero Dawn. A new plague known as the “Blight” is destroying organic life and causing widespread famine across the former United States. In an attempt to prevent the spread by restoring a back-up of a terraforming artificial intelligence known as “GAIA”, Aloy travels to “the forbidden west” to save the world.Aloy will travel to the West Coast of the former United States We’ll avoid spoiling the events that took place in Zero Dawn, but Aloy’s connection with the old world and access to its technology is a driving force in her determination to save it, stubbornly shouldering this burden despite a population unable to comprehend the consequences if she fails.What has set Horizon apart from the numerous open-world action games is its world building. The cautionary tale of unfettered innovation in the name of profit are familiar themes in a world both enamoured and terrified by artificial intelligence, but in its depiction of a world reborn against all odds, uncovering the mysteries of its destruction is what makes it so intriguing.Very rarely does a game make a compelling case to find every datapoint and audio log, but untangling the story of an old civilization in the throes of survival is half of what makes journeying through it so memorable.The other half is its combat. Throughout the world of Horizon, bands of tribal warriors are an obvious threat, but the most pressing are its mechanical creatures, taking their appearances from natural predators such as crocodiles and hawks all the way through to prehistoric dinosaurs like velociraptors and T-rexes. In Forbidden West, there is much more variation in the local fauna and new creatures, such as giant snapping turtles and elephants, dominate the region.New enemies known as “tremortusks” make a challenging new foe Each machine is formidable in its own right and as many travel in herds, they can be overwhelming in their response to Aloy’s presence, attacking her on sight. Aloy can use her “Focus” (an old-world device that reads and transmits data of her surroundings) to locate each machine’s weak points and different parts that can be harvested if they are successfully removed before the machine is destroyed.Using a mix of stealth, trapping, close and ranged weaponry before commencing each attack is recommended. Fights can become an intense flurry of defensive and offensive reactions. Creating space and knowing when to close in can feel complicated at first, as each machine can be relentless in their attacks, but using opportunities to create distance, stagger enemies, craft traps, heal and restock ammo quickly becomes second nature.While the range of weaponry has expanded, the fighting mechanics have stayed consistent with Zero Dawn, but there are plenty of quality-of-life improvements that take players out of menus and allow them to craft resources in real-time.Both in and out of combat, Aloy’s traversal has also been greatly improved, with a grappling hook that can be used to quickly ascend ledges as well as a hang glider which makes clearing long distances from high vantage points much less arduous. Through pre-release trailers and gameplay, there’s also been a higher emphasis on underwater exploration. While these sections of the game are a new feature for Horizon, they suffer the usual pitfalls of underwater levels, even if they are nice to look at.Aesthetically, Horizon Forbidden West shares a lot of similarities with Zero Dawn, which is a testament to how good the first game looked when it was released in 2017.The game looks exceptional on the PS5 There is a noticeable improvement in how the game runs as well as its lighting and water effects. Finer details such as facial animations also appear more natural than they did in the prequel, lending itself well to the quality performances from the colourful cast of characters.Without question, Forbidden West is certainly one of the best-looking games currently available on the PS5.Forbidden West also makes good use of the PS5’s dualsense controller. Loosing arrows, crafting and pulse-scanning all put the adaptive triggers and haptic feedback to the test.  Even if it doesn’t push the hardware to its limits like Astro’s Playroom, it does aid in bringing the immediacy of gameplay into the player’s hands.In Horizon Forbidden West, Guerilla Games has developed its post-apocalyptic marriage of technology and nature to craft a beautifully realised vision of a world desperate for rebirth.The story will take new players to unexpected and breathtaking places, and fans of Horizon Zero Dawn will have plenty of their questions answered.While Horizon Forbidden West takes great leaps in its visual and story presentation, it stays the path with its gameplay, making small but notable additions that improve the experience.Not much has changed since Zero Dawn, but when that gameplay revolves around hunting mechanical dinosaurs, why would you want it to?If you’re looking for discounts on technology or video games, then try one of these codes:Want to find out what PS5 games we’re looking forward to?

Horizon Forbidden West,Keza MacDonald,Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/feb/14/horizon-forbidden-west-review-an-eccentric-adventure-with-robot-dinosaurs,"PlayStation 4; PlayStation 5; Guerrilla Games/SonyFor a big-budget blockbuster game, Horizon Forbidden West is extremely weird. It is a detailed sci-fi story about a red-haired outcast warrior, the tribes that inhabit a post-apocalyptic Earth a thousand years in the future, and a bunch of robot dinosaurs. It’s a tangle of different ideas and complicated systems that only reluctantly interact with each other. It’s also a damn good time, and especially on PlayStation 5, a stunning example of just how good video games can look in 2022. You kind of get used to its beauty while you’re playing, but I found that whenever I returned to the game after making a cup of tea I was newly struck by whatever awesome scene was frozen on the pause screen: Aloy mid-roll away from a murderous mechanical hippo, or standing in the foreground in her war paint with an extraordinary view of mountains and snow behind.It’s when I was out in this world, following whatever trails I found, that Horizon made me happiest. I lost hours out there, retrieving random artefacts from old train stations or crashed planes, collecting so many plants and materials to stuff into Aloy’s magic backpack, and scrapping with the intimidating mechanical creatures that stalk the place. Getting into fights with these things is the absolute highlight of the game. They are aggressive, impressive and varied in both appearance and behaviour; they respond to you intelligently, and the combination of bows, traps and elemental weapons that you hunt them with can make each encounter feel like a battle of wits. It just feels incredible. I could play around all day in this place, trying to shoot the tail off a screeching flying metal monster so I can upgrade my bow.Following the story, I was less interested. Forbidden West’s plot is – and I say this with some affection, after more than 30 hours immersed in it – a barely decipherable load of MacGuffin-laden sci-fi, all painstakingly written and acted by an engaging cast and scriptwriters who’ve done the best they could with such a sprawling, unwieldy story. Briefly summarised, it boils down to this: Aloy must find a bunch of artificial intelligence subfunctions (riveting, I know) to rebuild a super-AI that can save her world. Conveniently these fleeing AIs have confined themselves roughly to the west coast of the former USA, whose deserts and ruins and mountains make up the enormous map that we’re given to explore with Aloy. (It’s always America, isn’t it? We’re never wandering the post-apocalyptic, overgrown remnants of, say, Liechtenstein, or Norway.)Horizon’s linear chapters highlight its less endearing quirks – the controls, for instance, which are unbelievably convoluted. The first couple of hours give a terrible first impression, introducing all of the slightly annoying things that you’re going to need to get used to. Climbing involves three different buttons. Spend a couple of days away from the game and your fingers will entirely forget how to find their way around the controller in a way that makes Aloy do what you want. The game pulls up little text tutorials throughout, which always made me laugh; I’d suggest that if, after 20 hours with a game, you still need to remind players how to throw a rock or jump backwards off a ledge, then the controls might be a little idiosyncratic.Other random minor frustrations, such as healing being tied to an ever-depleting stash of magic berries, or having to craft ammo mid-fight from collectible resources that can run out, cause minimal suffering out in the wilds – but not in the middle of a tough boss fight at the end of a long story mission, when they can stop you in your tracks.There are a lot more of these weirdnesses, but I became almost fond of them over time. I always enjoy games that come up with entertaining justifications for the extremely video-gamey abilities and goals that they give you, for instance, and Aloy uses old-world technology to scan creatures for weaknesses and highlight all of the collectible doodads on the screen. This is just so bare-faced and convenient as to be straight-up endearing. And though I lost interest in a lot of the (many) conversations that Aloy engaged in out in the Forbidden West, I never lost interest in her. She is a great person through whom to experience this wild and stunning place, competent and inspiring even when you’re fumbling around trying to remember how to call your robot horse, but end up accidentally scarfing a plate of virtual stew instead.I don’t think I’ve seen half of what Forbidden West has to offer. It bored me sometimes with endless dialogue and exposition, but is equally generous with things to do and places to explore and creatures to unwisely provoke. Unlike many open-world games it is continually offering you something new, and a couple of the tools you acquire later in the game really open the whole place up. It’s got the spirit of a Metroid or Tomb Raider-style puzzle adventure on the scale of an Assassin’s Creed. And once again: by god, it is beautiful. I’ll happily endure 10 minutes of being lectured about terraforming, in exchange for marvelling at these sunken caves, forbidding plains and mechanical T-rexes.Horizon Forbidden West is out February 18; £59.99 (PlayStation 4)/ £69.99 (PlayStation 5)"

			Guerrilla Games have turned everything up to 11 for Aloy's return – but is bigger necessarily better?
		Difficult second album syndrome is a long-established concept in the music world, the theory running that while groundbreaking bands have their entire lifetimes to come up with that initial starburst of surefire self-expression and fresh takes on familiar themes, sending them back to the studio to recreate that alchemy to order can be another thing entirely. It’s a creative conundrum I think about a lot while wandering the wastelands of Horizon Forbidden West, the sprawling sequel to 2017’s staggeringly successful action RPG Horizon Zero Dawn. Set far in a post-apocalyptic future where what's left of the human race is battling to survive against killer robots designed to resemble animals, the game's unique juxtaposition of neolithic tribal chic and hi-tech weaponry struck a significant chord. Earlier this month Sony announced the first game had sailed past the 20 million sales mark but in the sequel-hungry video game world, Horizon’s transformation from original IP to franchise was practically a given from the ring of the very first cash register. Indeed, in an interview that took place mere months after Zero Dawn’s release, then-PlayStation boss Shawn Layden told the Telegraph Sony would “be in the Horizon business for some time”. Zero Dawn rightly earned plaudits for its thrilling gladiatorial battles between woman and machine but it's often overlooked just how much that kinetic core combat loop masked more mundane open world gameplay tropes, with heroine Aloy filling time between main missions scaling towers to reveal the cribbed location of puzzle dungeons, bandit camps, caches of collectibles, and other familiar activities liberally lifted from Ubisoft’s early set texts. Second time around, raging against the machines remains an undeniably visceral joy but it no longer possesses the shock of the new. So how best to rekindle that spark? Perhaps inevitably, Dutch developers Guerilla Games’ go-to solution is scale. And lots of it. Almost every facet of Forbidden West has been exponentially enlarged, elongated, or, less charitably, padded out. The map is bigger, of course, but so too is Aloy’s moveset. As well as a hatful of hand-to-hand combos to master, each ranged weapon in her new (and, yes, expanded) arsenal now has multiple fire modes, unlocked and managed via six new and swollen skill trees. Then there are also a dozen or so ‘valors’ that confer special stat boosts or abilities once a power gauge has been filled, much like the ‘super’ attacks in Destiny, and even more elemental status effects to juggle with. It inarguably adds more tactical layers and strategic depth to combat but it’s also a lot to manage in the heat of battle. Fighting is still very much Forbidden West’s trump card; this is a series much more at ease with the former part of its action RPG genre than the latter. With the franchise’s Planet of the Apes-style plot twist played out to good effect in the first game, Forbidden West works hard to spin a similarly epic narrative web capable of snagging your attention but often ends up down convoluted sci-fi cul-de-sacs. It’s not for the want of trying, mind; no opportunity for exposition is passed over, with even the smallest of side quests accompanied by lengthy (and, mercifully, optional) pre-interrogations and countless lore-enriching datapoints to collect. It doesn't help that the game also takes an absolute age to hit its stride, its first half dozen-or-so hours spent ambling through de facto tutorial areas which will have returning players itching for the stabilisers to be removed. When they eventually are it’s like being given the keys to Jurassic Park. Forbidden West’s technically stunning game world is, frankly, enormous and crammed with distractions and diversions. To assist you in getting around this vast expanse Aloy has a couple of new MacGuffins lifted from the Legend of Zelda’s back catalogue: a grapple gun-cum-hookshot, and a device called the Shieldwing but which functions very similar to Breath of the Wild’s paraglider (albeit with none of that game’s nuanced stamina and updraft-micromanagement). Another addition is the ability to buy pre-prepped packed lunches that bestow combat buffs, seemingly cribbed from Monster Hunter’s menu. Verdicts on Guerilla’s brazen lack of compunction when it comes to cherry picking prime features from other games will vary according to personal taste but it does add to the general sense that Forbidden West would have benefitted from a tighter focus. It might seem like a churlish complaint but there’s so much to do here it’s often overwhelming. As well as the story and side quests and returning bandit camps, machine cauldrons and hunting grounds, Aloy's to-do list now includes exploring relics and sunken caves, fulfilling salvage contracts, collecting survey drones and crashed fighter jets' black boxes, solving vista tower environment puzzles, fighting in two different variety of combat arenas, and mastering the chess-like game-within-a-game, Machine Strike.Admittedly I have an obsessive compulsion towards completing open world games (and actually ‘platinum-ed’ the first game, completing every side quest and activity) but noticing my play-clock had ticked past the 24-hour mark before barely half of Forbidden West’s map had been revealed was a source of as much anxiety as anticipation for what was to come.Fans will lap it up, of course, and rightly so. Horizon Forbidden West offers more – much, much more – of the things they loved about the first game, and does most things better as well as bigger. But while there's a lot of things to like here, it's a harder game to love. Like a band who go for extraneous instrumentals and showy solos over memorable choruses, one can't help but want a tad less filler and a touch more killer. The example of difficult second album syndrome that most readily came to mind while I wandered these wastelands is the Stone Roses, who spent almost five years trying to outdo their era-defining, genre-defying debut only to emerge with a bloated classic rock retread that effectively ended the band’s career. That’s not to say Horizon Forbidden West is gaming’s ‘Second Coming’ – but it’s not the second coming of gaming either.Horizon Forbidden West will be released on PS5 (version reviewed) and PS4 on February 18th."

Do the machines still rage as Aloy turns west?When Horizon Zero Dawn first landed on the PS4 back in 2017, it was obvious Sony and Guerrilla Games had a sure-fire hit franchise on their hands – the idea of fighting monstrous robot dinosaurs in an apocalyptic wasteland was intriguing. The world was stunning, and Aloy was your archetypal outcast hero who was easy to rally behind.It wasn't perfect, though. The open world was vast but ultimately empty and the combat, especially against humans, was rough around the edges.Related: The best Horizon Forbidden West pre-order deals on PS5 and PS4With Horizon Forbidden West, the developers have a chance to refine the series into an even bigger hit, and after spending a long time with the open world game, we think in some areas they've sharpened the overall experience. However, they have sadly left other pitfalls much the same as they were before, making for a fun but still somewhat flawed experience.If you wanted more of the same, you've got that. In spades. But if you were looking for a huge upgrade and some big changes, you'll be left a bit disappointed.Back in the shoes of Aloy, the game opens with a montage of the first six months since the destruction of Hades. Our red-headed hero, in search of the world-saving super computer Gaia, finally gets a message from the ever-shady Sylens that makes it clear he didn't tell her everything she needed to know. Rather than destroying Hades, he made a copy for himself – setting up a chase into the Forbidden West in which she's always one step behind. It works fine as an initial set-up and pulls you in but so quickly becomes one of the weakest parts of the whole experience, taking the somewhat grounded story and turning it into something inexplicable just to keep things moving.In some ways, this was probably inevitable – what can't Aloy fight if she can take down gargantuan robot dinosaurs single-handedly? That’s right, immortal space humans who, for no real reason, can fly and live in permanent bubble shields. If that sounds boring to you, wait until you get to the final boss fights which are your classic overpowered bullet sponges. What makes this series work is the concept of technology and nature combining to make the world it has, and the stories of local tribes and characters are some of the most enjoyable to experience. So stepping off into hard sci-fi with little to no explanation just seems to miss that point entirely, making it hard not to bounce off the story and go off to find your own to tell. As soon as the game starts, it's clear to see the PlayStation 5 putting in the work to show off some truly breathtaking graphics, with colour bursting from the screen and plant life moving with the wind as you explore a range of regions and weather systems. Character models in particular are unbelievably detailed, never ceasing to impress even deep into the late game and offering a true taste of what this generation of consoles can do.The open world this time around is filled to the brim with things to do, no longer simply a big empty space. You'll come across small campfires in which you can pick up rumours from tribe locals or help them with whatever dangerous task only Aloy can accomplish.Training grounds, races, side quests and hunting grounds are a fun pastime, training your skills for the next step up – while a full-scale arena tests your might against increasingly more challenging machines. It's safe to say there's plenty more to do in this new game, without that usual sense of simply ticking off the various points of interest across the map. We rarely felt like we were simply venturing out for some glorified fetch quests, with plenty of side missions offering variety and not an insignificant amount of challenge.There's a lot more artillery available for you to dispatch enemies with – but with this push for more, the combat experience often feels rushed and frantic, which doesn't help an already chaotic combat experience. There are more than a few mechanics that have been nabbed from other popular open-world RPGs. Here, Aloy can cook meals for buffs and perks, organise resources in her stash and needs to customise and select the right weapons or traps for the right machine. When the conditions are right, and it's Aloy going mano-a-mano with a huge machine such as the Tremortusk, the combat sings. It becomes a beautiful dance of timing attacks, laying traps and working your way through their armour.However, the battle can often dissolve into a mass of different machines attacking at once, and you'll quickly find yourself just running for your life as you frantically try to find the right weapon on the wheel, or cycle through traps in a rather tedious D-pad menu. Perhaps this is something that could have been streamlined into a more traditional RPG system of picking a class and building into that playstyle instead of pushing you to be a jack-of-all-trades, but alas, you must find a use for all your skill points, though not all the additional upgrades feel particularly impactful.Battling human enemies is about as inspiring as it was in the first game, essentially being a choice between using basic stealth mechanics or raining arrows in an all-out gun fight – which isn't perfect as even straight headshots won't be a one-hit kill if the right bow isn't to hand. You can still use Aloy's spear as a melee weapon and, given the right improvements, it can be a viable option and can be fun to swirl around the battlefield with, but we can't help thinking this is a missed opportunity to offer a deeper experience. Considering how many of the tribes constantly talk about trial by combat, being born in battle, and so on, we can't imagine they meant floating around a field and smashing the R1 and R2 button until an enemy flops to the floor allowing for a stealth strike.This mismatch of dated systems with modern visuals and ideas of course isn't exclusive to Forbidden West, and it's not just about the combat either. Climbing is a huge part of the game as you'll often need Aloy to surmount huge cliffs and scale mountains to find rare machines or help out NPCs – yet this 'freedom' is hamstrung by needing to find the right glowing yellow spots in the right patches of rock to climb. You heavily rely on your vision  and hoping they don't lead to a random dead end (though the addition of a ""pulse"" to quickly discover climbable points in your immediate vicinity is helpful). There's also a suspiciously familiar gliding system that you'll almost certainly recognise from Breath of the Wild – why not just allow free climbing with a stamina meter at this point? This frustration can be compounded in certain smaller areas in which a fall means repeating large platforming sections from scratch – sometimes forcing you to wander around particular spots in circles while you find the right glowing spot before attempting a climb you know might end in failure.Related: Best PlayStation 5 deals 2022The story beats are much more streamlined this time around, with a clearer focus on your main goals. However, they aren't as interesting as the bigger side quests. The illusion of fighting through ostensibly high-tech corridors that are actually just generic grey caves are a stark contrast to the fun we had learning more about each of the clans and helping them through their daily issues. Whenever we were indoors, we spent most of our time itching to head back outdoors to the open world, which which should really be the biggest star of the show. As you build relationships with other characters, some will join you back at your HQ, opening up the opportunity to get to know these colourful, well-written characters that surround your journey – which is great, if it weren't for Aloy being such an all-knowing, petulant brat for most of the dialogue.At this point in the story, Aloy is quite literally a global superstar, famous for both the battle of Meridian and her more recent efforts, so it's rather jarring to see Aloy ""humbly"" brush off conversations and asserting her world-saving ambitions when she often just sounds ungrateful. She's quick to push other characters' opinions aside and pretty willing to murder and cause destruction as long as she gets her own way, because to her nobody else can apparently understand how important her mission is. At one point she obliterates a protective wall around a tribal village just to force them into joining her cause. Aloy, sadly, is the least interesting and most aggravating character in Forbidden West.Her constant observations of the world around you and pointing out the immediate path in front of you spoils any potential for exploration, and she will forever badger you to scan this object or talk to this guard before you get the chance to stumble upon that action yourself.  Frustration is the biggest feeling Horizon Forbidden West left us with. While parts of the game are stunning and a joy to play, there are so many others that feel outdated or pointless additions which serve to pad out the experience and not enrich it as a whole.Every video game of the modern era promises something bigger, but there's a skill in finding the balance between ""more"" and ""better"". There are dozens of new mechanical creatures to discover and fight, but it all boils down to how many arrows you're willing to pump into a critical part to kill it.You'll have plenty to do and there will always be another objective to distract you from the core missions, but at some point you'll find yourself crunching the numbers and plotting the best way to complete several additional objectives and level up before realising that it's all just a little bit tedious.The main story is one of the weakest parts of the whole experience, starting off in a manner you'd expect before taking a hard sci-fi turn that quickly flies into the ridiculous and unexplainable (so much so, the game brushes off any need for understanding in certain areas). The last part of the game turns into more and more MacGuffin hunts and finishes a villain's arc before it really starts.Sure, things are set up for a third entry in the series, but it's done in an extremely forced fashion leading us to wonder who had more say in that decision, Guerrilla Games or Sony.If you loved Zero Dawn and simply wanted more, warts and all, this is easy to recommend. But if you were looking for something groundbreaking with a lot more polish, then Horizon Forbidden West is really a mixed bag.Horizon Forbidden West is out on Friday, February 18 for PS5."
Horizon Forbidden West,Paul Sullivan,COGconnected,https://cogconnected.com/review/horizon-forbidden-west-review/,"*This review contains no spoilers for Horizon Forbidden West, and tags any Horizon Zero Dawn spoilers as such*Horizon Zero Dawn is one of the best loved new IPs from the PlayStation 4 era, having recently crossed 20 million sales and cementing Guerrilla Games as one of Sony’s heavy hitters. With dynamic gameplay and a compelling fusion of fantasy and science fiction, it’s no surprise that Horizon Forbidden West continues the journey of series heroine Aloy. And continuing is very much what Forbidden West is going for. It doesn’t rewrite the book or overhaul the gameplay, but it makes smart enhancements that make it a richer, more interesting experience that leans equally on its characters, story, world design, and mechanics. Journeying into the Forbidden West is a fantastic undertaking that’s well worth the time and effort.*Horizon Zero Dawn spoilers in the next paragraph. Scroll down to “To be clear” for the end of the spoilers*At the end of Horizon Zero Dawn, Aloy defeats the rogue HADES AI, stopping it from reactivating the Faro Plague that nearly wiped the Earth clean a thousand years in the past. The immediate threat quelled, Aloy seeks out the last resting place of Elisobet Sobeck, the Zero Dawn creator with whom she shares her genetic code. In a foreboding after credit scene, we discover that Sylens has captured HADES for his own purposes, telling the AI they have things to discuss. With GAIA destroyed and the biosphere at great risk of collapse, Aloy sets out to repair the existing damage and ensure the future viability of the Earth. That’s the bare minimum of what you’ll likely want to remember from Horizon Zero Dawn, as there are links to Aloy’s past exploits all over the place in Forbidden West.To be clear, you should really play and complete Zero Dawn before playing Forbidden West. It’s a direct continuation of the story, and big parts of the narrative won’t have the intended impact if you don’t know what’s going on. Even those of you who’ve played the original game are going to want to watch a recap video before you get going – I know I had to pause and take a minute to remember things.Without giving anything away, Horizon Forbidden West sees Aloy journeying west to rebuild GAIA and literally save the world. No pressure, right? Along the way there are countless great character moments, both with returning faces like Varl and Erend, and brand new ones like Alva, Kotallo, and Chief Hekarro. The team at Guerrilla has done an outstanding job of bringing familiarity to Forbidden West while also focusing their attention on new and exciting ideas. Much like Zero Dawn revolved around the ideas of and interactions between groups, Forbidden West weaves the web of interaction much tighter. What you thought you knew isn’t always based on perfect information. Of particular note is how the writing handles the culture and traditions of the various tribes such as the Tenakth and Utaru. In a world where subtlety in popular culture writing is distressingly rare, Forbidden West was a treat. There’s a massively diverse cast of characters who interact and grow through earned respect. Perhaps most importantly, the focus is on creating an engrossing world from the interactions that diversity creates.How many times have you played an RPG and only explored side conversations in service of completion? Horizon Forbidden West is packed full of lore, side conversations, and revelations about the world, and I wanted to hear, read, and observe everything. I never found myself wishing a character would stop talking, or wanted to button through a conversation, at least in the more prominent stories.A good deal of the jobs and errands in the game are very much that. Bring back this person, find this thing, kill this machine. They come as an expected part of this genre, but essentially the mechanical side of the game makes even those less story driven pieces worth doing.Many times I’d find myself getting completely into the weeds of hunting collectibles or helping one of the tribes out. Crucially though, it doesn’t go too far. Where I’ve found myself getting tired of the game in other action RPGs because of my completionist nature, Forbidden West avoids that fate by providing mysteries I desperately wanted the answers to. So for every Tall Neck I ran 5km to, there were equally as many times I ignored those activities in favor of continuing the main tale.A big part of the reason for that is Aloy herself.Aloy always felt like a paradox. She’s principled and extremely morally driven, endlessly willing to do what’s necessary based on her view of what’s right. But equally, she’s incredibly uncomfortable with the responsibility that’s been thrust upon her. The warmth of her heart isn’t easy to see, being shrouded by a cold, analytical exterior. Close relationships are difficult for her to establish. Aloy struggles to tell the people she cares about how she feels. In Forbidden West, she continues to be a fascinating character very well acted by Ashly Burch.Horizon Forbidden West does a brilliant job of exploring Aloy as a character, giving her a platform for character growth. Everything we know about her, and everything she thought she knew about herself is directly challenged. The story itself is a mirror of sorts, forcing Aloy to examine her own perspectives. Faced with both changes and challenges, watching and participating in Aloy’s grandiose and yet somehow delicately told story is an absolute pleasure.The world provides copious amounts of fuel for Aloy and the other characters to work with. There’s an incredible diversity of landscapes to be explored, smoothly covering most of the North American west with believable transitions. All the video game staples are of course here: snowy mountains, alpine forests, temperate rainforests, deserts, and more. Each has immense character, and often directly affects gameplay. Taking on a pack of Bristlebacks in the jungle or a snowy field are two completely different parties. The common thread is that each region feels like a real place with elements existing where you’d expect them to in reality. Believable world design and construction are far from an expectation in games, and Horizon Forbidden West has one of the most tantalizing worlds I’ve encountered.Throughout all those landscapes are remnants of the past. Structures left behind by the old ones often have much more to them than you see or the surface. Equally common are places where there’s no information to be found and the environmental storytelling lets your imagination run free. It’s a fantastic balance of showing and telling.Getting around the world is an organic experience. I recommend playing in the explorer mode, which limits the number of breadcrumb trails you’ll be following to the bare minimum. Though not as seamlessly refined as Ghost of Tsushima’s gusts of wind, there are few reasons to visit Forbidden West’s map screen. It’s far more engaging to simply point Aloy in the direction of her objective, and let the world design tell you how to get there.There’s of course the option to adjust things to suit your taste. But Forbidden West continues Zero Dawn’s minimal UI concept, and is designed to match that. It makes the world a more interesting place when you can just explore instead of needing to pull up the map all the time.Traversal isn’t nearly as seamless and formless as in Breath of the Wild though. Aloy can only climb certain areas of rock faces, even when they look similarly scaleable. Skyrimming (it’s a word) up a mountain in a way the game doesn’t expect occasionally leads to invisible walls. You’d think that would be annoying, but it barely registered for me. Of all the Horizon series’ goals, traversal would be less important than almost anything else I’m covering in this review.In lots of places, that leads to a fair bit of what I lovingly refer to as “open world jank”. Aloy can fail to step over surfaces that look mostly flat, or refuse to pull herself up onto a ledge that looks like many others. Other times her feet or hair will clip through objects, and these moments do remind you that you’re playing a game. But as I’ve alluded to, this franchise is less concerned with the act of going from A to B, and infinitely more interested in what happens along the way and once you’ve arrived. It’s a different approach than many competitors, and one that ultimately works really well.It does have multiple similarities to other open world adventures though, and throughout my 50 hours with the game I found myself most often comparing it to the latest series of Tomb Raider games. Like Lara, Aloy gathers gadgets and tools as she goes, and outside of a few game changing mechanics – like the shield wing glider and the ability to stay underwater for longer – they’re more about gating areas than changing how you play. It’s a Metroid-lite approach, and it works very well. I indeed felt compelled to return to areas many times not just for missions, but because I now had a tool that’d let me explore a relic ruin or other facility.Under the category of “more”, we most prominently find gear, crafting, and skills. These mechanics haven’t substantially changed from Zero Dawn, but there’s a heck of a lot more to them. Where there were a handful of outfits in Zero Dawn there are dozens in Forbidden West, each with unique tradeoffs, upgrade paths, and associated ways of playing.The skill tree has expanded more clearly encompassing Aloy’s array of skills, and includes a lot more choice in the process. Instead of treating them as a checklist I knew I’d eventually complete, I found myself rushing toward certain skills in certain trees, because I wanted to play a certain way. A vast array of weapon skills have been added to what was available in the last game, and most exciting is the new Valor Surge. It’s essentially a super that builds up over time, and can turn the tide of battle in an instant. A special potion that causes constant health regen was particularly useful in close quarters combat, while a surge that massively increases ranged damage for a few shots was extremely useful against enemies with particularly vulnerable weak points.That variety extends to weapons and elemental damage types too, with an absolute slot machine of different setups to consider. I tended to favor Hunter Bows, filling out my weapon wheel with options for dealing fire, ice, shock, acid, tear, and plasma damage (among other traits!), and the amazing thing is I could have ignored all those options. It would be possible – and fun – to replay Forbidden west with a completely different approach, working primarily with slings, or warrior bows, or shredders, or javelins. There are a ton of options, and though I focused in one direction the strategies are all equally interesting to play around with.You see where I’m going with this, right? Horizon Forbidden West’s combat is phenomenal, and a massive upgrade over the already excellent Zero Dawn. It’s extremely tactical in nature, and on harder difficulties it’s absolutely necessary to engage with those weaknesses. I found myself changing outfits and loadouts for specific creatures and encounters, setting up traps, and even planning escape routes before tougher battles. It leads to an extreme amount of satisfaction when everything falls into place and you detonate a canister on a machine causing a chain reaction, or you detach a key resource you desperately need from a rare machine. With practice, hunting in Horizon Forbidden West is supremely satisfying.All that might get boring eventually, if not for the vast array of different machines to take on. Plenty of them are returning favorites like the Thunderjaw, Fireclaw, and Stormbird. Even though I’d tackled those foes before, experimenting with new weapons and the strategies they enable was incredibly fun.
The new additions are great too: the Leaplasher, Tideripper, and Tremortusk to name a few. It continues the unique structures that made Zero Dawn’s machines so engaging – machines are consistently clearly identifiable and related to something real, but at the same time completely unfamiliar.Also, wow, the machines are meticulously detailed and well constructed. Each has weak points and armor plating that makes sense for the creature it’s based on, all of it completely dynamic and believable. I spent a lot of time in photo mode zoomed all the way in on machines, people, and environments just to take in the unbelievable level of detail and material quality in Forbidden West.Visually – especially on the PS5 – Horizon Forbidden West is jaw dropping. The art alone is enough to make a graphics nerd’s hands get clammy. Combined with the technical precision on display, Guerrilla has produced an absurd level of fidelity. Yet more impressive is how they’ve managed to scale the experience to run stably on the original PS4, albeit at a much lower resolution and without many of the most impressive effects.Cutscenes in particular look incredible. Aloy and the other characters look outstanding, with attention to detail that’s absolutely top tier. Aloy’s skin looks, frankly, real. Her cheeks are subtly windburned, a result of her months in the wilderness, while the fur around Varl’s collar looks… like fur. It’s a scary level of realism, and a lot of that has to do with the lighting model that’s in play.It’s cinematic and atmospheric, and works to enhance the characters and landscapes that are being lit up. So many open world games with dynamic time of day get that utterly wrong, and they should be looking at Forbidden West to try and copy that system. Vistas and overlooks are designed for that jaw drop moment, and it still hasn’t gotten old. Fog settles into low lying areas up in the mountains, with the light scattering believably. Surfaces are similarly affected by the light, reflecting and diffusing just as a real surface would.It’s a shame that ray tracing didn’t fit into the equation on PS5, though. Reflections appear to be mostly screen space based, and it’s one area where things can fall apart as a character near to the camera effects the reflection of distant objects and terrain. Perhaps in a future update or DLC, Guerrilla?On the animation side, things are mostly outstanding. I’m not sure if they did facial capture for every scene and minute side mission in the game, but it looks like they did in most cases. Characters emote and react well, and the lip synching is as close to perfect as I’ve seen. I say mostly outstanding because things don’t always work flawlessly. Aloy’s hair is a bit overactive for my taste, sliding back and forth over her shoulder like it’s coated in teflon. In a few scenes (even with the day one patch), facial expressions didn’t seem to play correctly. Particularly after a camera cut, I noticed a few times where Aloy’s face was her neutral expression despite the gravity and emotional nature of the situation. I’m sure this will continue to be ironed out in coming patches, and to be absolutely clear, this problem cropped up in probably less than 1% of scenes.There are definitely other bugs in the release version of the game. It’s definitely expected in a game of this scale and scope, but there are few things you’ll certainly notice. Occasionally, the game will fade to black for a second and fade back up if you’re traversing a big distance quickly, though this issue is far rarer with the day one patch applied. I also had a few hard game crashes during my time, but again, things have been smooth since the day one patch. The one thing that hasn’t improved with the day one patch is some sudden loading of assets. There were a few times that a tower or wall would suddenly pop into view as I approached, hiding the already loaded interior contents of the structure.Thankfully, outside of what’s mentioned above there were no progression or gameplay related bugs in my time with the game. Granted, my 52 hours played as of this writing only equated to 44% completion, so your mileage may vary depending on what content you check out peripheral to the main story.I’ll also briefly touch on the performance modes for the PS5 version of the game. I preferred the 30fps resolution priority mode personally. On a 4k screen, the resolution is far higher than in performance mode, and it gave me the cinematic experience I was looking for without noticeably affecting the level of control I had during combat and exploration. I did notice what I assume is some dynamic resolution scaling, and in busy scenes you’re liable to see a few jagged edges scattered around. In performance mode a solid 60fps is achieved, but in swapping between the two I felt like the performance mode smeared a layer of grease over the world I didn’t love. In all, both modes perform basically as advertised.So while Horizon Forbidden West isn’t changing the rules of the genre, it’s an excellently crafted, entertaining, and satisfying adventure. It looks phenomenal and offers a sandbox of gameplay that remains just as unique as the original. Is it more of the same? In a way, I suppose. But I know I wouldn’t say no to more of Horizon Zero Dawn as it was 5 years ago, and Forbidden West is an improvement in nearly every way.*Review copy provided by the publisher*Developer: Guerrilla GamesPublisher: PlayStation Studios"
Horizon Forbidden West,Rob Larkin,Gaming Nexus,https://www.gamingnexus.com/Article/7523/Horizon-Forbidden-West/,"Horizon Zero Dawn was simply one of the best games of the entire PS4/Xbox One console generation. It is a treasure that everyone should play, even if it was exclusive to Sony. Having been ported to PC around a year and a half ago, most should now have that opportunity. Gaming Nexus' original review gave it the highest rating we had at the time. It appeared in our favorite console games of the last generation three times from the eight writers, including in my submission. I open by reminding you of all the praise heaped upon the preceding game because, amidst all the accolades that are sure to come the way of Horizon Forbidden West, you would be doing yourself a disservice if you have not played the earlier entry first - not just because Zero Dawn is so darn good, but also because Forbidden West has no interest in holding your hand and getting you up to speed with this sequel.Horizon Forbidden West hits the ground running. It makes a passing attempt to recollect the previous game only in so far as it is wrapping up some goodbyes with the few central characters that don't carry on into this next adventure. The opening mission is through an old ruin with a familiar face alongside, even if that face has collected a full beard around it. From there we move back to Meridian for a glimpse at the site of the first game's climatic final battle and to give those farewells to friends left behind, and then on to the West, the Forbidden West. This is the land beyond the reach of the Carja, the land of the Tenakth - the Carja's historic enemies since the 9th Sun-king's reign, now at bay under an uneasy truce. We leave what was once the Arizona deserts and now realm of the people of the Sun. We leave Aloy's home in what was the Colorado Mountains and all the rest of the locales across the Rockies of the first game and move through the deserts of Nevada all the way to the coastline of California to make our heroine's mark on new peoples, new tribes, new challenges, and even new machines. These first few moments move quickly, the path through them mostly linear. There is only a minimal introduction to the game mechanics, inventory management, or backstory. Forbidden West expects you to step into Aloy's shoes and to know the paths those shoes have trod to have gotten this far. It does not build you up into the role. If I have one criticism of the game, it's probably that right there. I adored Horizon Zero Dawn, I was captivated by the story, enthralled with the gameplay, it was a complete gaming experience. But it has also been years since I last picked it up. I remember well the main storyline but the details have gone fuzzy, and my reflexes when trying to take down a Scrapper fuzzier still. I had forgotten about Ropecasters entirely until deep into one forge and was frustrated by a particular beast getting the better of me before the memory of that strategy finally flooded back, but I was a long way from the nearest weapon shop where I might even buy one. You start this new quest with a spear and a bow and hopefully a much better recollection of the arsenal from the first game - and how to use it - than I did. Following the main storyline, you are rarely going to run into the upgrades you need to overcome various difficulty hurdles on that singular course. You have to take inventory of what you're missing and seek it out in the world yourself, find a few shops, locate a weapon with that element absent in your loadout, upgrade that base armor before your lack of defensive fortitude rotates into being the weak link in your game. For example, at one point, fairly well into the quest, I realized I still hadn't equipped any of the coils or weaves I had collected for elemental boosts to my weapons and armor. My beginning load out has no slots unlocked and I had forgotten about these modifications, which were a large component of the first game, before I found my damage lagging on my targets. Then, when it came time to actually equip them, I couldn't actually figure out how to do it... I had missed the button in the inventory screen and assumed I needed to head over to a workbench. A little onerous I thought, but whatever, it actually makes some narrative sense. In the next settlement I strolled up to the workbench only to discover there was no mod equip button there. What gives? Finally after returning to the inventory screen in the pause menu did I finally find that button for weaves and coils. Here is a basic gameplay mechanic, a central component of building a loadout and I first forgot it existed and then couldn't figure out how to do it, partly because I'm a bit of an idiot, but also because Forbidden West took no interest in teaching me.I appreciate what I think Guerrilla Games was trying to do here, not to rewrite history and start you off back at square one. ""I've been... traveling light."" Aloy herself exclaims in the first mission when questioned as to where all that gear collected over the dozens of hours of Zero Dawn went. It fits in with tone and the immediacy of the quest itself. I really like that this is a true sequel, not a reboot of the first game, but I also think that pendulum swung a little too far. A quick in-mission tutorial on a weave slot in the prologue could have gone a long way. The player certainly doesn't need to be spoon-fed, and maybe it does fit not to teach them; but a reminder would have been appreciated, especially because we're talking about a sequel to a five year old game here.When the Forbidden West does open up in front of you it is am impressive expansion of countryside, forests, mountains, settlements, machines, and quests - so, so many quests. The thing about games like this, and by no means is Forbidden West alone here, is that the main narrative thread is one of hurry up and save the goram world, and yet you are plopped into a world where every other stranger you pass by is bleating about their issues large and small and no one but ""The Savior of Meridian"" is apparently available to assist. On the rare occasions where a scout/search/war party is sent in advance, the mission merely changes to ""We lost contact with the party, can you help?"" I'm not so much criticizing here, because the intent and the effect is an immersive landscape with lots of things to do; but when the ""fate of the world"" are the main campaign's table stakes, then your missing brother/sister/coworker up in that mountain/cave/abandoned ruin doesn't exactly carry the same weight when the clock is ticking on a larger narrative where... we all gonna die. In that main narrative is a compelling and engaging tale. While you play the hero, this game takes the tact that you are, in fact, not alone. Your friends carry the burden with you. The main thread is one that takes on much greater depth in relationships. NPCs are partners on this journey, occasionally accompanying you on particular quests and holding their own in the battles that ensue. While Aloy may be the genetic copy of Alpha Prime - Elisabet Sobeck herself, it is the company around her that drive what will come after, either in success or failure. Old friends combine with new faces and the central thread is not one of hero worship or elevating the champion above the crowd, but about community, about bringing people together, and fighting for a common goal towards a better future. It's powerful stuff and presented with aplomb. Guerrilla has a capable cast, including A-listers like Carrie-Anne Moss, Angela Basset, and Lance Reddick that deliver on a well-crafted script. The plot builds on the seeds laid in the first, and nothing about it feels forced or cheap. This review naturally comes with heavy restrictions on what details I can provide, but I wouldn't want to spoil anything anyway. It's excellent story telling that is worth every moment of the journey. So there is this impressive, expansive West to explore in either 4k 30fps or 60fps under a lower resolution. The draw distance from the mountaintops into some of the details that you can see opening up before your eyes as you leap form the peak and glide down into that space is just awesome. The world comes alive with weather effects, flora and fauna, and changing environments - every once in a while, too alive actually. Cutscenes can be interrupted by the odd butterfly floating in front of the camera but if that's the price for the immersion of everything else, it's one I'm glad to pay. Performance on the PS5 is excellent. Loading is unnoticeable across this incredible expanse. I know enough about game design that I can understand why certain corridors are placed where they are, but as a player you can move seamlessly across the entire map. In the earliest days of my review I encountered a few lighting and texture issues. They would only happen occasionally, usually triggered when entering or existing a cutscene, but haven't noticed a single issue since the most recent patch, and any others I have confidence the planned day one patch would solve as well. Every once in a while the screen does blink black, but that appears to be precisely when an auto-save is triggered. Seeing as auto-saves are always planned when away from key moments or combat scenarios it was noticeable, but never an issue. Two weeks of playing on a pre-release build and only minor issues, nearly all seemingly solved already should bode well for others' experiences. The immersive world, fantastic cast, great story, it all builds on the foundation of Zero Dawn. While there are some noticeable improvements, the game does not try and reinvent anything, only expand on that sturdy base. In addition to the new threats and enemies I will not spoil, there are new machines to battle. Giant mammoth like Tremortusks fill the screen. Massive snakes, hooded like cobras, stretch as tall as a multi-story building. If you thought the Thunderjaw was the baddest foe in Horizon, he's not even the baddest giant dinosaur anymore. New machines to fight. New machines to override. There's even new things to mount, like the velociraptor like Clawstriders.  There are also new skills to master... once you finally get your groove back and remember the skills you had lost from the original. Movement is much more fluid and refined. Aloy hurdles, traverses, jumps and dodges better than ever. You even earn both a glider and a breathing apparatus to transition the fight across the elements of earth, wind, and fire water. Battles can become real dances with certain foes, once you've sheared off any ranged weapons they might be pointing at you first. You also have Valor abilities, special buffs that can be applied every so often when the Valor meter is full. One ability might give bonus damage for melee weapons, another for ranged, another might blink you invisible - the perfect get of jail card when you find yourself overwhelmed by odds not ever in your favor. New elements can be attached to your arsenal to pinpoint enemy weaknesses, like purple plasma that fizzles and damages over time or orange adhesive that can gunk up an machines movement even better than a ropecaster ever could. Weapons themselves get special effects too, like nocking up to three arrows into a single bow draw, or releasing them high to land down in a mortar like volley, or tossing out tripwires in rapid fashion.  Horizon Forbidden West has it all. I was skeptical at first, because I have been such a fan of Guerrilla Games since the Killzone series and I was such a fan of Zero Dawn, I just couldn't believe Forbidden West would live up to the weight of that expectation. In my first days of playing, with the occasional graphical glitch (now seemingly fixed) or with the occasional hiccup of stumbling over gameplay elements or storyline that had grown stale in my mind in the years since last playing the original, I wasn't sure it was going to hit those heights. But as the story moved from strength to strength, as this awesome world unfolded before my eyes, as I kept iterating over that fulfilling gameplay loop of stare down giant machine, break gun off giant machine, reduce giant machine to giant pile of scrap to loot with their own detached gun, I settled back into every comfort that made the first the classic it is. Horizon Forbidden West is every bit the game Zero Dawn was, if not better, and deserves the same praise. Just do yourself this favor first: if you have the time to replay Zero Dawn in its entirety first, do it and do it now. If you can't wait to take the reins again of everyone's favorite flame-haired Nora, then at least drop into a ""Story so far"" video on YouTube before embarking on this next adventure. Horizon Zero Dawn was one of the best games of the last console generation. I'm not sure I see any reason why Horizon Forbidden West won't go down as one of the best of this generation. * The product in this article was sent to us by the developer/company. First picked up a game controller when my mother bought an Atari 2600 for my brother and I one fateful Christmas.   Now I'm a Software Developer in my day job who is happy to be a part of the Gaming Nexus team so I can have at least a flimsy excuse for my wife as to why I need to get those 15 more minutes of game time in...

The original text follows.With Horizon Zero Dawn, Guerrilla Games set the bar very high for itself. Its first attempt at an open world action RPG really resonated with PlayStation fans, thanks to intense combat, a compelling narrative mystery, and a great lead character. It's a lot to live up to, but having now spent dozens of hours playing Horizon Forbidden West, we think it's about as good a sequel as fans could hope for.Set six months after the first game's conclusion, Aloy is traveling far and wide to prevent the world from spiralling into another mass extinction. Ominous storms brew in the sky, and an unusual red plant is spreading rapidly across the country, killing all flora and fauna in its wake. Her search for answers leads her to the titular Forbidden West, a dangerous region that's home to the volatile and deadly Tenakth tribe. Of course, all sorts of obstacles present themselves, not least of which is Regalla, a Tenakth rebel waging civil war with her followers and an army of machines at her command.We certainly won't be going into spoiler territory here, but rest assured that there are plenty of twists and turns in the sequel's complex story, building upon the present day tribal conflicts as well as the events and ramifications of the past. With Zero Dawn unveiling such a fascinating history and constantly presenting you with immense revelations, the sequel was always going to struggle to do better. Forbidden West's narrative may not quite have the same impact as the original, but it still has its fair share of WTF moments, and the way the story is presented is certainly an improvement. Audio logs are still here, but most of the plot is conveyed in a more organic way.That's in no small part thanks to improved writing and a much, much better cast of supporting characters. Some familiar friends, such as Varl and Erend, join Aloy on her quest and are even more likeable, while new faces such as Zo and Kotallo are fantastic. Everyone feels more fleshed out and human, and you'll grow to like them as they play a larger role in the overall narrative.Similarly, conversations with other NPCs are improved as well. Quest givers and merchants are afforded far more personality this time around, and all conversations are now livelier than the static back and forth headshots seen in Zero Dawn. It's here where you may notice some janky facial animation, however. The game looks astonishingly good 99 per cent of the time, but with such polished presentation, things like eyes darting around or poor lip syncing are more noticeable. It's not the end of the world, but a shame when the rest of Forbidden West is so beautiful.Yes, as expected of Guerrilla Games, the visuals are sublime. The setting, which includes arid desert, snowy mountains, lush jungle, and crisp shorelines is gorgeous through and through, with some incredible sights strewn across the map. The artistic design is incredibly strong; the machines are impressively detailed and wonderfully animated, while human characters are among the best seen in open world games. Each tribe has a recognisable identity with their wonderfully outlandish outfits and body paints. There is some rare pop-in, but it's a very good-looking game — particularly in the 4K resolution mode. The performance mode still looks great and is our preferred way to play, but to get the game running at 60 frames-per-second, the number of pixels takes a noticeable hit.You might not have much time to soak in the sights, though, as you'll be too busy having fun, battling those hulking great robots that roam the land. Tying the game together is the combat against machines, and it's just as satisfying as ever beating the odds and taking them down as a one-woman army. In fact, the DualSense controller comes into its own here, enhancing the action with some well-implemented haptic feedback. Some of the more subtle things done with the controller are really great, like the feeling of the tall grass brushing by as you walk through it, and the increased resistance on the trigger when preparing an arrow.The machine designs are brilliant, with some new additions like the fearsome Slitherfang providing some of the game's best fights. As before, you can equip many different weapon types, including new ones like powerful Spike Throwers and the Shredder Gauntlet, which launches discs that deal damage for a short time before returning to you. Figuring out the best ways to deal with machines, whether it's using traps, removing some of their components, or just taking advantage of elemental weaknesses, is far and away some of the most engaging combat in the open world realm.You can even use Aloy's spear, which is a more viable option now. Less so against machines, perhaps, but the improved melee moves make human battles more interesting. You can of course revert to your trusty bow, but some human enemies will rush you and engage in close combat. After unlocking more moves in one of the skill trees, melee is definitely more exciting, and fighting Regalla's rebels is more enjoyable as a result. Throw in the Valor Surges, which are special moves that can quickly turn the tide of battle, and combat overall has more to offer in Forbidden West.I already expected the combat and presentation to be exceptional in Horizon Forbidden West – and, as Stephen has already articulately explained, it is – so it’s the cast that’s most impressed me in this long-anticipated sequel. The supporting characters in Horizon Zero Dawn were some of the most forgettable in recent RPG memory, but Aloy’s sophomore story is packed with interesting personalities.It all helps make for a more believable backdrop, where you can buy into the idea that the various clans have existed for years, each governed by their own unique outlook on the world that shapes them. The way Forbidden West segues between spirituality and sci-fi is extremely engaging, and the release has just the right amount of levity to offset its more serious subject matter. All of this is supported by an addictive gameplay loop, which makes the moment-to-moment exploration moreish – even if it can feel formulaic at times.Finicky platforming and a little too much repetition of core gameplay systems prevents the game from realising its full, unbridled potential, but this is still an open world you’ll want to invest in, and the Forbidden West will linger long in the memory – even after you’ve left.Sammy BarkerEditorIt still forms the basis of many missions, but you'll be happy to learn quests and other activities are more diverse than ever. The Hunting Grounds return to offer machine combat training, and Melee Pits now also fills that role for, well, melee. A huge Arena provides you with more extreme challenges, while out in the world, you can find Gauntlet Runs, which are races astride machines. Furthermore, there are a range of environmental puzzles and collectables to seek out. The best part is that most of this optional stuff feels cohesive, fitting in nicely with the wider narrative. Even Tallnecks and Cauldrons — essentially ""radio towers"" and dungeons — are more varied and more closely tethered to the story.There's plenty to explore off the beaten path, although some may be disappointed to learn the climbing is relatively restricted; clicking R3 will ping Aloy's Focus, which reveals items to pick up and handholds she can traverse. It never felt like much of an issue that you can't just climb anywhere, as riding around on machines or using the new glider and grapple hook can get you to most places. We did find the climbing to be a little fussy at times, with Aloy refusing to grab certain outcroppings, but it works perfectly fine for the most part.While there are some small irritations, then, we don't want to leave things on a sour note. Horizon Forbidden West delivers where it matters most, improving on the first game's shortcomings and building on the established lore in meaningful ways. We've thoroughly enjoyed returning to Aloy's world, one that's filled with bafflingly silly yet captivating sci-fi, and a handful of characters that, by the end, we genuinely cared about.Overall, Horizon Forbidden West is a huge improvement on its predecessor. The map is diverse and full of stunning sights; characters and conversations are so much better; and the already great gameplay is enhanced with new weapons, more options, and better melee. The story doesn't have quite the same element of surprise as the first game, but it still builds upon things with some daring twists of its own. Any minor quibbles we have melt away when the game's firing on all cylinders. It's a gorgeous, wildly fun action RPG, and there's nothing else quite like it.Excellent 9/10Scoring PolicyReview copy provided by Sony Interactive EntertainmentPlease note that some external links on this page are affiliate links, which means if you click them and make a purchase we may receive a small percentage of the sale.

I mean, I’m sure we all kinda hoped/expected this level of quality… but it’s always good to get a bit of confirmation. Friday can’t come soon enough.Hey! Any questions, just copy me in. @get2sammyb may also be able to help. We'll both keep an eye on this comments thread today Knew it would be great 😃Brilliant review, Stephen! This game is good.I was not expecting a 9. I usually only check PushSquare, Inverse, GamesRadar and Easy Allies for review scores, all have scored it 9/10 except GamesRadar who gave it 4.5/5.
Congratulations, you've just pushed my hype levels higher than I thought they could go.Absolutely can not wait for Friday.(In the interest of clarity, I skipped straight to the score. Will read the review later) ❤️The review score sounds just about right! Roll on friday! Going to look amazing on my ps5!Hurry up friday is all i can say.I'll be getting this from the app on friday. Excitement levels are rising...No surprises here. Would love to hear more about the graphics though, especially since it's a next-gen game. Compared to the predecessor?/ compared to RDR2?
@quintumply (awesome review btw)Edit: Would love to hear about the attention to detail? (some un-expected attention to something for ex)Beyond ready for this!Still busy with Dying Light 2 and with Elden Ring next week I'm going to give this a miss for now.I never got into the original and despite the insanely pretty graphics I don't see this one grabbing me eitherI'm hypeeeeedFriday can't come soon enough.I just finished Deathloop. And since I don't have too many great PS5 games I had to cave in and ordered this now. I pray I'll like it @Splat pfp checks out@lolwhatno Visually it's a surprisingly big leap from the first game. Aside from a bit of pop-in here and there, it looks truly wonderful, especially in the resolution mode (but it looks great either way).Red Dead 2 I think has the edge in terms of sheer attention to detail — I don't think I've seen a more well-observed setting in a game. But Forbidden West is still very impressive; I think the machines are brilliantly designed and if you really look at them, they're so intricately put together with loads of moving parts.@Quintumply I had played the first one after I had already played breath of the wild. So whenever I was roaming around I would usually try and climb everything only to realize that I could only climb certain things. Having said that is this game similar in that aspect? I love being able to climb everything and it's kind of hard to go back to not being able to.@Quintumply hah, that's awesome to hear! Thanks for replying.@hayesdude You can't climb anywhere. Climbing is closer to Assassin's Creed than Breath of the Wild. But as I say in the review, you can get basically everywhere with little trouble.@hayesdude Same here, if I can't climb the table at the bar I'm breaking the disc. I love being able to climb everything, If I see a mountain in the horizon I want to be able to climb it.Edit: Your username proves that you're my arch-nemesis....Our battle will be legendary!Red Head Redemption!! That's a good one. Super hyped for it. Finally another big title.@get2sammyb @Quintumply Did either of you try the PS4 version or were reviews codes just for the new gen?I can't wait for this game! I wonder what the trophy list is like. If I remember correctly the first one was pretty simple so I'm guessing more of the same. Either way I'm platting it.88 with 66 reviews on Metacritic88 with 78 reviews on OpencriticHyped for it. Sony don't miss.I expected it to be a bit higher since it looked to me it improved in everyway. It's gonna be tough for goty though hehe.Can't wait for this! Loved the first one. Sadly, going to be a few weeks for me as moving house shortly and need to wait for some internet service before I play it.@steizgr8 same. as much as I look forward to it. There's only one game I'd put it aside for. And that happens to come out a week later: Elden Ring. But Horizon will be the first game I'll jump into after that. What a good ""problem"" to have.Wheyyy! Both this Friday and next are gonna be good days for me if feel 😁@Thrillhohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wFAKxvJpU4https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMVVs1QTeAwLooking forward to playing this eventually. May have even preordered if it wasn't for Elden Ring next week. I wouldn't mind replaying Zero Dawn first either. Great read!Oh that’s a nice review. I hope you guys keep the second opinion a trend and expand it. I’d love to see that for Elden Ring. It makes Push reviews more interesting. 👍@lolwhatno wait, are we still calling ps5 games ""next"" gen?I knew the characters and dialogue would be very much improved (you can see that in The Frozen Wilds) but it would be hard to top the engaging story from Zero Dawn.4 more days...@Quintumply Is the music just as brilliant as it was in the first game?Slightly baffled that you guys have stated that this is a huge improvement on HZD, yet you also gave HZD a 9/10?@lolwhatno I'm sorry I already got an arch-nemesis, you can be a regular nemesis, if that's alright?Phew, physical pre-order was worth it. Ceeelebrate good times, come on..Good to hear, Sony rarely misses with these big exclusives.And they're gonna need them now too, since Microsoft has decided to just outright buy up the whole industry.Great review! Agreed that Horizon FW story was always going to struggle to match the OMG revelations from the original but it seems to have improved in many other ways. Looking forward to this.@Thrillho I have the PS4 version installed on my base PS4 and will be writing up some impressions on that version soon!Slightly worried about the story because I thought the first one’s was pants so being worse than that is getting into worse than pants territory. At the end of the day, the gameplay’s mostly what matters though so could be still worth it.@ApostateMage The music is very good, yes. Personally, I'd put this game's OST above Zero Dawn's, but both are strong.Is it true that the performance mode on Ps5 is 1080p?! That's unacceptable. If So im canceling my pre order. First dying light and now a first party cross Gen title can't get higher than 1080 at 60, cmon. I hope this isn't true.definitely one I will get when I get a M.2 SSD for my PS5. I just don't have the room right now and it need it for Elden Ring among other things.@nessisonett If you didn't like the first game's story then this one is unlikely to change your mind.@KundaliniRising333 I'm unsure what the resolution is when playing in Performance Mode but it's definitely not 4K. I'm sure Digital Foundry will enlighten people soon enough.I tried HZD but did not really like the beginning nor the gameplay. I think it is too much bow fights and heavy animations to move Aloy. For me it is much less appealing than any big open world games like RDR2, BotW, or The Witcher. I will probably stay on Pokemon Arceus for now !Should i expect the same from the sequel ?Despite all those praises, this still is a title which more-or-less will be played in [email protected] by majority. Will there ever be an AAA game with native [email protected] to trully represent ""next-gen"" ?Cancelled my physical copy preorder a few days ago. Not that I'm not interested in the game, but because I haven't finished HZD yet and Elden Ring is around the corner. Might as well save a few bucks by buying it second-hand.I really hope that the performance mode is not less than 1440p. Eagerly awaiting Digital Foundry's eventual upload.GREAT! My week off work will be well spent!I just can't wait, the game looks so good. I don't even know if I want the performance or not since the visuals are so impressive@Quintumply yah so far Ive read 3 reports suggesting it is 1080 on latest patch and one stating the latest patch may have brought it to a Drs with a max of 1440.DF will enlighten I'm sure. If it's 1080 I'm going to pass cancel pre order, and wait for eventually patching and huge price drops. Just not worth the sacrifice down to base ps4 resolution for 60 fps on Ps5. Elden ring here I come.@Simong85 Forbidden West is very similar to Zero Dawn in terms of gameplay, but everything is improved. If you don't like the emphasis on ranged combat and using a bow and arrows, I can't see that you'll enjoy the sequel's combat either, as it's mostly the same. But it is better than the first.@Quintumply Have you tried the game in an OG PS4? I have the game pre-ordered but I am afraid there may be performance or other issues...Even on a Review comment section for Horizon Forbidden West, there's still too much talk of Elden Ring. Cool your jets Soulsborne fans, let another game have it's time in the spotlight.😉Great review. Basically it improved upon some aspects (side quests, secondary characters) from the first whilst still being a lot of fun to play. The world remains beautiful yet dangerous, even more beautiful on PS5 and only the story is a slight downgrade on the first but that's to be expected imo.Really, if you loved the first one than you're likely to enjoy the second just as much if not more soIf you didn't like the first game, than just like Eurogamer, you'll probably not be impressed with the sequel. If that's the case, it sucks to be you, but there are other games out there for you to play including something about a ring but not the One Ring, that's a different and much more rich fantasy world that many have tried to immitate but never match.Got the disc on order, really looking forward to it and Friday can't come soon enough!@Medic_Alert oh well that's not as bad as others have suggested. Ill give it a view. Thnx@belmont I will be playing the game on a base PS4 very soon, and will be publishing my thoughts in the near future @velio84 I played on Normal throughout. I'd say difficulty wise it's on par with the first game; I definitely died a few times due to carelessness when fighting some of the game's bigger machines!@Medic_Alert oooh that’s actually very good
Edit: DF will have their video out today but John Linnemann says the 60fps is ""well above 1440p""... but he still chose the resolution mode for reasons he's going to explain in the video.Great review!It's a shame that I couldn't get into the first game after trying on three separate occasions, maybe one day I'll finally push through and play this series (it took me 4 attempts at The Witcher 3 to finally fall in love with it)Whilst I write this comment in my local coffee shop, a bus with a HFW advertisement on the side has just slowly drove past me... a sign?Not gonna read the review, but I'll appreciate the time and effort nevertheless! Gonna go in with a blank opinion (however biased lol).The wait is quite unbearable now lol@Quintumply so can i ask the usual boring ""how long to complete "" question?i only skimmed trough the the review to prevent spoiler sorry.@jdv95 Hmm. I would say you could get through the main story in like 30 hours? But there's so much extra stuff that you could easily double that, or more, if you want to see everything.@jdv95 One review I saw said they were at 43% completion after beating the main story in 40h. Most mention beating the game in 35-ish.@Quintumply that's awesome. 30 hours for story so it's a bit longer then hzd's story?@Voltan oh wow so a good 60/70 hours for complettion,that's awesome.It looks and sounds pretty good, but a lot of what the Eurogamer review mentions is stuff that would bug me, so I won't be rushing out to get it.@naruball Yes the gen moves with me. When I buy a ps5 it will make sense to call it current gen....Nah, just kidding I'm just in denial.@hayesdude Who is your arch-nemesis? I'm going to murder him to take his place, or am I not even second on the list?What are the difficulty options and accessability options available?What's the mini-game like? Does Nils make an appearance? How big is the map compared to the first one? What's the 3D Audio sound like?On sound, the score was brilliant in HZD but then so was the audio design for the machines and interactions with the world like using the focus. Just as good in part? Even better and more refined?This really does sound like a special game, made for fans of this first one and for those with an open mind. This is for sure the most gaming fun you can have in February and possibly beyond, hard to see any game being more enjoyable to play in 2022.😝Except for maybe Stray, I mean who doesn't want to play as a cat? Kurt Zouma maybe and that lady with the greyhounds but other than that, noone.😉@XOF Oh, hey it's you again! I hope that you enjoy the game mate!Happy gamingIf anyone is wondering the ign youtube review is awesome!The reviewer really sounds like he cares about the game/fans stops short of spoiling areas and new enemies because he says he doesn't wanna spoil it. Genuinely surprised by IGN@scpnightwing There are five difficulty settings, from Story — very easy — to Very Hard. There are lots of accessibility options you can tinker with, I think Guerrilla highlighted a bunch of those over on the PlayStation Blog.@Col_McCafferty The mini-game, Machine Strike, is surprisingly complex. I didn't play it too often but I thought it would be some token inclusion; if anything, it's maybe a little bit too complicated for its own good. If you like strategic board games, you'll probably like it though!The music is great and the audio design is fantastic, as with Zero Dawn.@Quintumply A separate ps4 review?(Base machine at that!),nice one!! Started to fear we'd stop seeing ps4 reviews with so many being cross gen titles tested only on ps5! So long as the ps4 version/ engine holds up to the original game I'll be happy.👍Meantime Eurogamer still dying on the ""Horizon series not worth an award"" hill,so I regard that a plus already in its favour since I loved it!😁@Robocod Yeah, EG couldn't be seen to be 'wrong' about the first one so gave it to someone who clearly wasn't going to enjoy the sequel, just so they can continue to sneer at the series whilst overly-praising anything from Xbox and Nintendo.I'm sure the Digital Foundry review will be a lot more interesting and fair. Any Sony open world game is slated on EG, were these same games (Horizon, Tsushima) released by Xbox well they'd be creaming their underwear.@lolwhatno Simon Cardy is one of my favorite games media people even if we don't always share opinions He hosts the IGN UK podcast, btw - probably my favorite podcast.@Robocod I don't think it'll be a full on review, but certainly a piece focusing on the PS4 version is coming.@Quintumply Somewhat surprised not to sew anyone else asking this but: what sort of proportion of the new machines are rideable? Flying mounts?@Quintumply is it more complex than Gwent? I may be one of the few that didn't like that game, at least not as much as all the hype. Probably because I was ***** at it!I much prefer Orlog from AC Valhalla, although that's one of the few things I do like in that game.🙄@lolwhatno well before you start killing anyone, you got to submit your arch-nemesis resume. I got to know what you bring to the table as an arch-nemesis.@Voltan I missed his name at the start of the review, yep it's him. Will definitely check out the podcast, thanks for the info!@lolwhatno Haha, we meet again! I hope you have a great time playing HFW too! only 4 more days to go.@tofuman86 yeah, for the PS6 😄I don't think the PS5 or the Series X can handle native 4k and 60 fps. I mean look at the RTX 3090, which is way more powerful than these consoles, it still struggles with running AAA titles at 4k 60@hayesdude Aw crap, I suck at writing:Ok here's why you should accept me in the position of your arch-nemesis:I am a highly stimulating individual, and I bring my nubile work ethic with me wherever I go. My throbbing demeanor and uncircumcised attitude lubricates the work flow, and my penile mindset secretes productivity, which ensures that I vigorously penetrate any sort of work environment. No work load is too bodacious for me to suckle, even when it's protruding off my desk. I make paperwork into a childbearing activity, and I always inseminate cooperation into my coworkers. As a matter of fact, in my last job, everyone commented on how much my supple energy fertilized efficiency in a menagerie of different scopes. Despite my tender fondling of the bottom-lines and the bulbous girth of my experience, my boss discharged me for being naughty with the office dongles. An engorged company like this surely has a pungent HR capable of gyrating these sorts of problems away. I am a flaccid person to get along with, however, my glands may pulsate if the management is too Nubian to lactate properly. Regardless, I'm sure my succulent resumé will titillate your ticklish sensibilities.@theheadofabroom Only a few machines are rideable!@Col_McCafferty I'll be honest, I barely touched The Witcher 3 so I have no idea about Gwent. @XOF Thank you, the hype is unreal. I'm still undecided on Elden ring or HFW lol!in the meantime, please say hi to Erend for me.So - we get that there's a graphics mode - and a performance mode... but you say the performance mode has a significant hit to the pixels.... how significant? Also, there's something a bit strange having your ""second opinion"" in the middle of a review - and also, it's a little strange having a 2nd opinion.... why not a 3rd or 4th? Just feels a bit odd. Also - shouldn't there be something for the PS4 version -that's the real issue (if you're saying the PS5 version isn't really up to it either). Anyhow - I think most of us are looking forward to it... and yes, we understand that HZD wasn't perfect, and this won't be either. What I missed was the - OMG feeling in the review (from what I felt in the original game). Maybe I'm reading too much into the comments.@lolwhatno if you liked the review you should go watch the review discussion about it on ign games all of them at ign seem to love horizon.HZD was my first ps4 game so I spent 100+ hours doing everything and I'm excited to return to its unique world and continue the story of Alloy on ps5@Quintumply Sacrilege!The Witcher 3 is a masterpiece, only the mighty RDR2 is held in higher esteem by this lone gamer.Maybe give it a try when the PS5 version is released and rectify your wrongs.😉@Quintumply we have digital Foundry for that job.Even if it looks beautiful, it's not for me. Found the first game to be very boring after the first few hours.But much fun to those, who enjoy it.@Oz_Momotaro The second opinion is just to provide even more information. We were very fortunate in that we received two codes for Forbidden West, and with a game of this size, we wanted to give readers as much info as possible. Hence why Sammy gives his two cents in the review too.Impressions on the PS4 version are coming soon. Glad to see it turned out good. I liked the first game but didn’t love it, gameplay was pretty fun (it did feel like a Ubisoft game at times urgh) but the story was poor and Aloy was so dull imo, so I’m gonna wait until I pick this up.You guys are too honest and thoughtful. You should do what Nintendo reviewers do and think ""I like it and it's first-party, 10/10”.@Oz_Momotaro I totally agree, @Quintumply please can you include more OMG feeling in your reviews moving forward? Thanks.@Oz_Momotaro Dude, it's another reviewers opinion....It's written under the second opinion part@Quintumply Do I need to play the first one to play this one? I mean of course you do, but I mean in a way where they don't talk about the first one to much, I know its stupid to ask, but I would like to know.@Arisen Will google it, studying rn so I don't have time to watch it but thanks a lot for the suggestion.I also loved HZD, wasn't my favorite game of all time.  I prefered Days gone, no don't stop, idk  I prefered days gone.I hope that the game exceeds your expectations mate. I also hope that you have a great rest of your day, happy gaming!Ive got to wait until 22nd before i get it for my birthday. I will be avoiding everything HFW that i see on here and on YT until then. Man its gonna be hard to not just go buy it 😂@Snatcher The story is a continuation from the first game, and the first game establishes A LOT about the world and Aloy, so I would recommend at least reading or watching a catch-up.Having said that, there is a quick summary of the first game's events at the very start of Forbidden West, so there's that. I think you could get away with playing this without playing the first, but you might want to do a bit of homework first so you're not scratching your head through the whole thing.There are some serious salty reviews out looking for hits in my opinion.Can’t wait to play this Friday, download and ready to go.@Quintumply Thanks for responding! I'm probably going to try and play the first game, if not I will read the first games story.@Snatcher Oh hey, another apex player. What is your main? I'm currently maining rampart.@Dezzy70Slant, USGamer, Thegamer, gamer. usually rate games low so I expect that from them. I think I saw somebody give Uncharted 4 a 4. A 4!!!Saw that people are questioning Stevivor's though. There's a pattern between Sony and Xbox games. Anyways it doesn't bother me. It's just 2-3 that don't enjoy gaming as much. Ghost had 83 and it was the second most awarded game that year.I hope Stevivor didn't ruined GG's bonuses though. That would be a second time they don't get the 90.Thanks for the review and insights. I'm probably going to wait a bit on this one, as I liked, but didn't love, the first one. One thing I DID love was the audio logs about the punk band that was developing over the course of the story in the past, and was one of my favorite parts because it was so different. It was nice to hear of how these people were coping with the situation while not being so ""it's the end of the world"" about it.@RevGaming Yes I saw all that as well. They should not allow these review scores on Meta.Not the 10 I was expecting but still a 9 ain’t bad. But then again there’s only one PS5 game that’s got the special 10 honour and that’s Demon Soul’s so let’s be honest pushsqaure you are a little bit picky. But then most major critics have given it a 9, gamespot another who’s difficult to please have given it a miserly 8. They really are picky. Looking forward playing it soon.@ceedj Yeah not realistic. Covid hit and people are going this is the end of the world, so when it will really be the end of the world Idk what they will do lol!@andy24king Demon Souls Remake is so far my favorite game from the PS5. This will probably beat it.@lolwhatno haha. Makes sense.Not even a 'recommended' from Eurogamer? And tbh this review scores higher than it sounds from reading it.Glad I haven't dropped any cash for this as yet.Hi there fellow gamers.Nice review @quintumply.I can´t wait to go back into the world of Horizon and just roam around exploring the beautiful different locations and fight the deadliest machines. It´s gonna be great. Also that a very interesting thing having @get2sammyb giving second opinion, or any other member of the Push Staff.The review get´s a bit more rich and the readers get more info.Roll on Friday so we can play this beaut of a game.Cheers, stay safe everyone and happy gaming to us all@RevGaming I’ve not played Demon Soul’s cos I hear it’s tough for those who don’t have much patience. Basically not easy at all. But I might have a look. Of course Horizon beats it.@Quintumply question to confirm how I buy it, as I don't want to risk messing it up please?I have a gift balance on my Amazon account and a Digital-only PS5....I need to buy £60 of PSN vouchers, then add them on my console.Then use my Web browser on my PC to access the UK PSN store, and buy a PS4 copy of Horizon.Then my PS5 will let me download the PS5 version?@Col_McCafferty Hey there friend, hows it going?Completely agree, Witcher 3 is absolutely fantastic and I´m very curious to see how the PS5 version is going to play and look like.It will be another excuse to replay some of the best quests I´ve played in a RPG and some of the best DLC storylines in a game.Also, Gwent is kinda addicting. Once you get some good cards it becomes very fun.Two amazing open world games to enjoy. happy to be a gamer.Cheers, stay safe and have a good one my friendGreat review! Kind of what I expected, but more Horizon is exactly what I wanted.I’m saving this until I get a PS5 though. I’m sure it’ll melt my eye balls off!@Quintumply how long is the story? Excellent review!@Toypop Yes, that method should work for you. Buying the PS4 version gets you the PS5 version as well. Once the transaction is done, you should be able to find the PS5 version of Forbidden West in your console's game library @Just2Milky Roughly 30-35 hours, but there's loads to do outside of that. You could spend double that in the game, for sure.Yikes... That's a damn shame. Story was the weakest link in ZD for me. Really hoped they'd have some better storytelling this time around@Quintumply great review! I enjoyed the first game, the machine combat was phenomenonal but the human combat was a little lacking. How did you find it in the sequel? Have they improved the human ai to match that on offer from the machines?@BoldAndBrash are you talking about the tribal present day story? Or our present day story with Faro and Sobeck?I found the backstory to be one of the best in recent games.The story in the first game was fantastic, not sure what some people disliked about it but that's their loss.I think if you liked or loved the first, you'll probably end up feeling the same way about the sequel. It doesn't sound like it's reinvented the wheel, but neither is it fair to say that it had to.More of the same, with new machines, new enemies, old friends and even more beautiful to boot.That'll do donkey, that'll do.😉@R1spam Machine combat is still the star of the show, but fights against humans are definitely better. They're more engaging here thanks to the improved melee options you have.As expected. Horizon is now one of the games that don't even need reviews.@Col_McCafferty Agreed. I know people have different opinions and tastes but calling the story of Zero Dawn 'boring' or 'pants' has me baffled. The way it was told, especially through datapoints, was very, very good and quite haunting I thought.I know a guy who wont play a game with a female protagonist!! I asked him once "" so what like is supposed to happen? you think you are going to grow a set of chi chi's after you complete the first chapter?!:He TILL THIS DAY, wont play HZD and he wont probably play FB.. What a sad state of affairs....@ApostateMage most gamers dont read notes, get collectibles or do side quests. Hence their experience is very low level.. On most of my games I tend to read voraciously, look around at areas and the environment. I talk to most NPCS that I can, and i do a majority of the side quests. I mean the developers put that CRAP there for a FRICKING reason!!! right??@TheArt Unless it turned out to be a complete mess, Forbidden West was always going to be a must play for many many millions of PS owners. Some reviews may be more slightly negative but I think it's fair to say that those are being written by people that didn't even like the first one.What I loved about HZD was that it was pure escapism and wasn't afraid to have fun with its mad cap yet still scary premise. It sounds like they played it 'safe' to a certain extent with the sequel but in the process improved upon aspects from the first whilst still being very enjoyable to play.Friday can't come soon enough, hopefully it will be delivered that day and I'll spend much of the weekend, and beyond, having a great time in the world of Horizon.@Just2Milky The game has interesting stories and the setting is amazing, but I found the storytelling and the bland characters to be pretty atrocious. That in itself brought the whole campaign down for me. Loved the game tho, but was hoping for better in that aspect@Kidfunkadelic83 Hey there friend.Fortunately, your wait is not going to be that long and it will be a great way to enjoy your birthday with an awesome game present.With HFW, Elden Ring and GT7 is going to be pretty interesting juggling all these games. I need more than 24 hours a day.Oh and @lolwhatno, I´m exactely the same. To me, PS5 is still next gen and it´s going to be for a while. And once you get one, you´ll see why the SSD, the 3D audio and the Dualsense makes such a positive different experience.Cheers, stay safe and have a good one you twoThis may have been mentioned already, but I'm not going through 100+ comments. I will say it's a shame Guerrilla still hasn't figured out facial animations and such like that, as that was one of the only major shortcomings for me with Horizon Zero Dawn. Maybe they should have gotten some help from Naughty Dog or Sony Santa Monica.With that said, my anticipation for the game is still extremely high. I loved Zero Dawn regardless of the facial animations. I just wish they had managed to figure that out by now, but I know I'll still love the game. 4 days!@MakersMark We can be glad Tomb Raider, Horizon, The Last of Us part 2 and Resident Evil 3 are popular, but I get you. Some people really hate playing as a woman.@Col_McCafferty @ApostateMage
I think it's either people not liking sci-fi stories or thinking Aloy is dull (I think she's the opposite).@Col_McCafferty I really don't get people. It's a sequel. Do we expect Ghost 2 and Spider-man 2 to not look like it's the same game (but it really isn't)?I wasn't overly hyped for this one, zero dawn was good but it didn't have me chomping at the bit for a follow up. If it's as good as initial reviews are saying though then I'll probably pick it up sooner than intended.@BoldAndBrash The way I understand it - the story packs less surprise, because you already know how the current state of the world happened (which was the main thing in Zero Dawn) but most reviews agree that the way it's told is better this time around.
Oh, and they definitely mention how much better the NPC's are.Great review. Can't wait for Friday.@Voltan Then I misunderstood it. That's good to hear then!@KilloWertz It's much, much better than Zero Dawn. Like, at times it does rival the likes of The Last of Us and God of War. You've got to remember though that there are hours and hours and hours of conversations in this game — much more than in any Naughty Dog or Santa Monica game — so it's really hard to get the motion capture to the same standard completely across the board.This is the best I've ever seen it done in an open world RPG, even though it's not perfect. It's vastly superior to games like The Witcher.@MakersMark It's a shame but I bet many missed the story about Bashar Mati (the druggie son who loved his mum) told through the vantage points, which was a well told story in itself. Concrete Beach Party in The Frozen Wilds was ace, too.@RevGaming To be honest, I wasn't that keen on Aloy at first but she grew on me and I really liked her character by the end. Her friend/foe relationship with Sylens is great.N.i.c.e i knew this game was gonna be amazing.still playing horizon complete edition.a 9 is a amazing score.word up son@buckp25 There aren't TOO many puzzles. (I haven't quite finished it yet.) It's not a particularly difficult game and any puzzles you'll get through quite comfortably I think.Wow so soon, it's only Monday... it's good that the revew came in so early, but also bad because the next few days until launch day are gonna be filled with even more of news about the game, reviews and articles and opinions and gameplay videos etc... Imo, the review embargos should be lifted 1 day before launch, to avoid so much of the game being revealed. Evidently one can always choose not to watch any of it, but it's kinda hard to stay away when you bang your head on something about the game on every gaming site... and for the next 4 days straight .... very tempting target  Alas, already preordered the Digital Deluxe edition for the PS5, and already preloaded it. Can't wait to finally begin the journey west!@RaZieLDaNtE Yeah it was really fun being able to add in the Second Opinion. Hopefully we'll be able to do more of this — glad you liked it! @get2sammyb I liked the second opinion too. I cant remember what website does it (maybe Gamespot, as if you would aspire to be like them!) but an ""alternative take"" section can always be an interesting read.@lolwhatno Will do! It's a tough choice, I'll give you that. I was pretty damn torn between them myself, but I decided I just couldn't wait for Elden Ring while HFW is out! lol@RaZieLDaNtE Oh hey, If it isn't the nicest person on the internet!Glad to hear that I'm not alone here with this thought lol. Really excited to try out the acclaimed haptic feedback!Happy gaming and thanks for being awesome.@RaZieLDaNtE hey, it will be a great birthday present. Will have a whole day of work before i get to play it tho. It will be the longest day ever 😂I have booked the 4th March off for GT7. I wasnt going to make that mistake again.Have a great day.@MakersMark Hi there friend.""I know a guy who wont play a game with a female protagonist""That is kinda kinda sad and strange to read.There are so many great games with pretty cool and interesting female protagonist out there, that it´s a shame your friend won´t get to experience them.@RevGaming mentioned some really good games and I want to add Returnal, Control, Final Fantasy VI and Mass Effect, since so many players have resonated with FemShep.I don´t know, to me, if a game has good and fun gameplay mechanics, amazing visuals, interesting characters, a great story and a world to explore, I don´t care who the main character is, what he or she looks like or even their romance preferences, as long he or she is a well written one. That´s it.I just want a quality, fun and engaging gaming experience.Who knows, maybe your friend will have a change of heart eventually and be able to play even more fantastic games.Cheers, stay safe and have a good one@kyleforrester87 Awesome! So glad to hear the positive feedback! Hopefully it's something we'll be able to do more of, especially with big games like this!9, impressive score but not surprising. It also seems to be the number of ads that appear on the page.I understand that including advertising on your blog brings in money and I’m fine with that, we all need to make a living. But it’s gotten a bit ridiculous, I’m scrolling and waiting for the screenshots to load only to discover it’s another ad. I mean 1 video, 2 images and 9 ads…@Col_McCafferty Yep, the only people who'd give it a low score obviously didn't get into Zero Dawn. I remember always finding excuses not to buy HZD because I didn't get the shooting giant robots with arrows mechanic, till I played it for myself and realized it's one of the most OUTSTANDING games I've ever played! I got HFW installed, raring to go Friday dawn. I had a feeling they'd take inspiration from RDR2, and from what I'm reading, looks like they did, y'know towns with personality and all.@ApostateMage Haha yeah Aloy at first was a bit annoying like Ellie but I started to like her. Plus I think people who didn't like HZD's story probably would've paid attention if most of the holographic parts were told with fully rendered cutscenes haha.My PS5 is coming, and Horizon 2 will be the very first game I will buy for it. I bought the console now to play it. Loved Zero Down, and Forbidden West was always my most wanted next gen game. It's closer now!!Sounds great! I'll be picking this up.. eventually, once it goes down in price.Most anticipated game of the year for me (would be a very close second to God of War: Ragnarok but we all know that's getting pushed to 2023). Can't wait for Friday to see if it meets my very high expectations. Horizon was, by far, the best new IP of last gen, imo.Can anyone tell me if the camera still drifts from right shoulder to left like HZD?@lolwhatno I am not the nicest person on the internet, but I´m definitely the coolest 😜😉 Your gonna love your PS5, I´m sure of it.@Kidfunkadelic83 I did the same thing for the 18, 26 of February and the 4 of March.Man those are going to be very fun days indeed.Awesome time to be a gamer that loves action rpgs and racing simulation. And then there´s the Switch games like Advance Wars Re-boot Camp, Triangle Strategy and Xenoblade Chronicles 3...... I need to win the lottery or something 😁Cheers, stay safe and all the best my friendsGreat review and I particularly appreciated the second opinion box - roll on Friday!I am replaying the first game on PC currently and it is really making me wish this was also on PC day one as well. I may end up just waiting for the PC version. I like the series but God of War and this game are just so much better on PC as I don't have to pick between looks and performance. I really thought the PS5 version would have both, but it seems we are still stuck choosing.Sounds like Guerrilla pulled it off! I’m excited to play it eventually. Love seeing that second opinion box!Ah, ok, this and the second opinion help me know I will not like this as I did not enjoy my time with the first one and the things I did not like are still there.That being said, still sound like a great time for those who liked the first, so I'm happy for y'all!@Quintumply All good...just nice actually getting separate comment/mini review type thing giving feedback on how the PS4 version fares is quite helpful! Having a 2nd opinion for the review almost feels like a throwback to Zzap!64/Amiga days!😁👍@Col_McCafferty Yep,between the defenders over at EG ""Its different reviewers!"",ignoring how recently they said in their Pokemon review it didn't deserve a recommendation & gave it one anyway,they're looking rather silly...or for click bait reactions🙄...maybe their review needs marking down...since they're so big on nitpicking repetitive things!!😋 (Apparently only when its a PS game!)@lolwhatno yes I also enjoyed IGN review. Same score as pushsquare but he seemed quite taken with the game.Amazing, cleared my weekend... another must play gaming epic from Sony!Didn't expect a 9 that's for sure. Just one question, what's Aloy like to control underwater?Eurogamer and a few others seem to be rather critical on the story.Dunno why but it seems believable as it takes the same arc as Guerrilla's previous games and it seems like they've not really fixed the issues with the previous game due to them not being groundbreakers. More copy and pasting other ideas and turning it in to a bit of a mish-mash of well executed things but not coherent.Hyped for Friday. HYPED.So hyped for it. GOTY material!!!But I noticed from all the reviews I've watched, so many QUITE BIG and some minor popping issues. Some places while they walk into settlements the game freezes for 1-2 frames. Not so fluid animations when you switch from normal combat hits to surge animations and much much more. Hope they patch all this eventually, so I can replay it on New Game+ in all it's intended glory!@Quintumply Is the an embargo of telling us whether or not any flying creatures are rideable?@NinjaSixx different generation gaming. HZD was a 9/10 for a great ps4 title and HFW is a 9/10 for a ps5 title @get2sammyb Can you use you focus while running around? In ZD you couldn’t.Yus let's GOOO!!!!It's going to be a long work week making it to Friday for sure. I haven't been this excited for a new game release in quite awhile now. Ugh, this is one of those moments I wish I could be put into suspended animation for 5 daysI admit to being confused why Sony made a machine where you couldn’t play in 4k 60fps as standard and have to throttle next gen games to experience the full quality.My Xbox x let’s me play 4k 120fps with ray tracing as does my 3080 powered pc.Anyway - great review thank you, stoked to play it next week!(Ps - The PS5 is still the best console, best controller, with the best games imho - the Xbox is frankly ***** and the pc is a pain to stream to downstairs with inferior story based games)@RaZieLDaNtE I'll definitely be replaying The Witcher 3 on PS5, hoping to give Cyberpunk a go on the PS5 as well.I imagine I'll enjoy pretty much every second of my HFW playthrough, will likely take my time with it and drink it all in. Just hope it will be delivered on Friday as planned otherwise it will be more Planet Coaster for me!@Dobbos Yep, talked like he was sharing with us something he enjoyed rather than doing a job.@RaZieLDaNtE Call yourself whatever you want I will second you on it, thanks for being the coolest guy on the internet.@Quintumply Not sure if this has already been covered but is there any carry over between save files from the first to the second game? Sometimes sequels will carry over gear or decisions made in the first game and other times they'll reward returning players with something else. Any of that here? My PS4's Hard Drive crashed a couple years ago and took my original Zero Dawn save with it  Just wondering if I'd be missing anything if I just started the sequel fresh. Thank you!@tabris95 Not that I'm aware of. The game never surfaced anything like that when I fired it up. 99% sure there's nothing that carries across.@Quintumply Thank you for the reply! I'll be starting Forbidden West on Friday with a clear conscience then!Nothing I didn't love about the first game so I know I'll love the sequelI found on PlayStation's site that you can set the camera to the left or right. So that annoying camera drift in HZD is apparently gone 🤘@lolwhatno So sorry for the late reply.I'm in a odd spot, I thought I was a hardcore mirage main.But then I actually try'd to learn crypto two season back. And, lets just say I have built up a big love for him.So I think, i'm a crypto main, mirage is my 2nd, and wattson is my 3rd.When did you start playing rampart? Before the buff or after?@Quintumply Lovely review, thanks. That's got me hyped up for the game nicely@GKT Yes, that's correct. You can choose how you want the camera to be positioned as you please. @Quintumply @get2sammyb Sorry if you've already answered this question. How did you find the hero lighting in the game. I know some on here weren't convinced of it in some trailers?@tofuman86 me too! I can’t believe this isn’t happening yet!I’m so looking forward to this. My only issue with it is that it’ll arrive Friday and I probably to get to start playing it until Sunday night.@nessisonett agreed. As good as the game was, the story was poor. It was like Fantasy Young Adult novel. Luckily the gameplay shoneI think Horizon is one of those series that either makes you obsessed (like I am) or it’s not that appealing.I loved the first game; it was my favorite PS4 title. I loved the setting, the lore behind the story, the characters, the technical excellence of Guerrilla games, and the fantastic machine fights. It wasn’t a perfect game, but it was on those few open world games that I played from start to finish, explored most of the game world, and did 80% of the side quests. That’s a rarity for me; I’m not the biggest fan of open world titles most of the time. Zero Dawn, Breath of the Wild, and Ghost of Tsushima are the only big open world games I played to completion while doing most of the side activities.I’m expecting I’ll love Forbidden West even more than I did Zero Dawn, since it sounds like my two biggest complaints from Zero Dawn (the boring human fights and the stilted conversation scenes) have been massively improved.@get2sammyb Well, ok then, that's good to know and thanks. I was just going by the mentioning of it in the review, but it seems that my concerns were for nothing.Again, glad to see that they did vastly improve the facial animations then. Either way, it's not like it was going to keep me from playing this right away. It's far and away my most anticipated PS5 game up to this point.@Palleon You're confused because you don't understand what's required to run a game at native 4k and locked 60fps, especially one with the open world scale of something like Horizon, and more importantly, when that machine needs to come in at an affordable and competitive price point for the target mass market these consoles are aimed at. This is evident by you stating what your 3080 can do, a card that is at minimum twice the price of a PS5, and that's without a single component required to run it.If that's the kind of performance you were hoping for at £450, or even £360 for the digital edition PS5, then I have some disappointing news for you.@Quintumply In the cons, I see you note ""janky faces."" Unless I missed it, I don't see mention of that in the review body. Can I get some more info on this?I enjoyed the first game but found it had many little annoyances - wooden facial expressions while characters talked being one of them. This wasn't really a problem for Aloy but mostly affected NPCs you talked to. I had hoped they'd fix it for the sequel but I guess not.Another minor annoyance was the plot which, for the most part, was obvious right from the start. Glad to hear that the narrative is stronger this time around.Another minor annoyance was the platforming which, based on this review, doesnt seem to be fixed. It was never a deal breaker but was one of the thousand cuts that lessened the experience in my eyes.Sorry but I wont believe it till I see users reviews. The AAA game is nothing but a bunch of greedy executives.Jus wanted to leave some kudos for the hilarious tagline xD... Thanks to your review I pre-ordered the game now, hope this PS4/PS5 upgrade thingy will work...@Quintumply Can you unlock both the Nora Legacy outfit andNora Legacy spear via in-game progression?Already have my copy pre-ordered, should be shipping on release day! Gives me time to go back and replay the first game's story.If it's better than The last of us part 2 than I'm down for it. I just don't want to waste a another 20 hours of my life on a game that might be as bad as that game 🥶. I love the first HZD game, got the platinum but I'm scared with how Sony handles anything now . I'm waiting on user reviews and see if the game actually doesn't waste the players time@Snatcher Oh don't worry, it's alright.Also, I'm not crazy to use rampart before her buff lol! At first she seemed insanely OP but over time I realized she is more of a strategic characters than others, you can't just pull out SHEILA and mow down every one the wind-up time doesn't allow for that.I'm still learning her and I'm relatively new to the game (level 50, started last season). Also, I love crypto mains, their ability to just pick up your banner and rez you from miles away is awesome. I hope that you enjoy your new buff.Happy gaming!@BrotherFilmriss I guess they never miss huh.Seriously though, they always have great taglines. I hope that you enjoy the game mate.@MakersMark What is the logic behind that? Did he explain why?@lolwhatno Aw thanks, the buff is amazing, but takes some getting used to LOL.Happy gaming to you as well!@Snatcher Don't want to reply there since he might feel like we don't care about him (discussing about something else). You mentioned being on NL, does that mean you play apex on the switch?! That sounds painful lol!Also, are you too getting fps drops in olympus?@lolwhatno Oh Heck no, ps4/ps5, And yes, the drops are so bad, I haven't really gotten to play. They said there working on a fix.@Snatcher Oh that makes more sense lol! Nice to hear that they are working on fixing the problem (but also surprised that they didn't notice them).Anyways, thanks for the friendly discussion, have a great day mate.Is the ps4 to Ps5 upgrade only available on disk or is it also digital?@lolwhatno Same to you as well, but your probably seeing this a day after LOL, a night after?@WanderingBullet Nora Legacy gear: I have no idea. I've yet to find it and I'm dozens of hours in. Unless it's a very late-game outfit then I think it might be a pre-order only thing.@LivingLeif Janky faces: I mean they're definitely better in this game than Zero Dawn but, just on occasion, Aloy and whoever she's speaking to, their eyes will point in some odd direction, or the lip-syncing might be a little off. It's not a deal-breaker at all, and it's not all the time, but it sticks out because the game looks so good usually.@AdamNovice Hero lighting: Didn't bother me in the slightest, I actually really like the visual style of the game and its characters.@Quintumply I see. Thanks.@nessisonett I found the first game fantastic. With all the collectibles that fill in all the backstory how everything happend.@phillyjeff Well this was the most useless response of the day it even makes me look good.@lolwhatno LolIf I´m the coolest, then you´re the nicest 😜So thank you friend, for being the nicest person on the internet 👍Cheers, stay safe and enjoy the week@get2sammyb If you get trophy Reach the Daunt before March 25th Sony will plant a real Tree https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhkN3OGYI80@Quintumply Is there an option to hide headgear?@hugoadan Yes, there is, in the Settings menu.@Quintumply Awesome! Thanks for the reply 👍👍Just reading the review now... just want to say, I hope Guerrilla make a 3rd Horizon game with Rost taking the lead telling the story of Alloy becoming an outcast and the part he played. Imagine playing as Rost, Kratos in Horizon? YES PLEASE! I also think this would complete what has so far been a thrilling story. I can't wait to play Forbiden West, I did cancel my pre order as I'm saving for a car but re-enstated it today. Roll on Friday!!@Quintumply is the ps4 -> ps5 upgrade available for a limited time(a year)? Or will it be around for good.I feel like there’s a sort of bias because this is a PlayStation focused site..@PhhhCough I actually don't know, it's a good question! On the PlayStation Store page, I can't see any mention of a time limit, so presumably the offer will stand for a long time.@Quintumply @get2sammyb Your review gets a nod and readout on MBG's video channel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwyKATn-pOESo sad that this game was held back by the PS4 and we never got those illusive flying mounts.Wish will have been at least a ps4 pro review. If the game is available also on ps4 pro, for us who couldn’t get a ps5, will be a great help to hear how the game looks, plays etc..@Richnj
Bronze trophy - Completed 2 Flying Mount Quests@Futureshark But the PS4 doesn't have that super fast SSD, therefore, is not capable of flying mechanics.I didn't enjoy the first Horizon game as much as others and aren't really fussed for the second, but I really enjoy seeing Guerrilla Games get all this praise. They have clearly done an amazing job and although I feel I need a Killzone game for myself, I can't help but be happy for a team I have nothing but respect for!Hype train comethCan't wait to get off work tomorrow! This baby is getting delivered in the morning.. I'm actually super happy a game can still get me interested/excited. Been a gamer for over 25 years and there is less and less games that get me pumped up for release day.Where's the KoF 15 review?This also deserves a 9/10@Nacheis absolutely the same here. I didn't enjoy the first one that much.I really could never get into the first game. Tried many times. Bring on Elden Ring!@Quintumply Yeah, its preorder set and available from the very first time you can open your stashThis game is good but much buggier than dying light 2 is, and people were complaining about that. Just coming off that and in to this was jarring, as the fluid pakor in dying light is really missed here and movement feels clunky in comparison. Seems like a great game so far.The game is decent but after playing another several hours (about 12 total), it's just bizarre and disappointing in some aspects technically. Some sort of sacrifices were made in both performance and resolution modes in Ps5 that have absolutely resulted in some very distracting visual quality elements on anything that isn't within like 15-30 feet of your character.Not sure why too, when you look k at rdr2 or even a more recent example would be dying light 2. That game runs at a stated lower resolution and has way less shimmer and blurriness of items in the mid to far distance. While I get that the textures and assets are far different in that and hfw, still hfw has a great deal of downscaling the further away from the character you are and to have the bizzare blurry static particulation going on as well, it is definitely underwhelming. This was no where near like this in hzd. As a cross Gen game I thought the visuals at 1800 p would be far less muddied on the Ps5 version . I recently tried to play dying light 1 to see if I'd be interested in 2, and couldn't make it through because of the dated blurry 1080p visuals. Hfw has that same resolution based blurriness in the mid and background as well.I do hope it gets addressed if possible. Or perhaps a 45 fps 4k mode be implemented that lessens whatever scaling issues are resulting in this.Is it possible iT just looks worse on a 65 inch 4k TV? (it's not an old or cheap model, but the flagship high end Samsung and most other games with great visuals look outstanding on it, without using the ever broken hdr as that is a whole other Playstation issue in itself).I'm sure these will get ironed out by guerilla, and much of this is to be expected playing an open world game at launch.@gamer_since_83 What did you think of Deathloop? My PS5 has been out for repair since early Feb (arriving tomorrow, allegedly) and it was the last game I played. Killed 2 of the people with powers (forget their name) and have invisibility and the jump forward in space abilities. Game hasn't really grabbed me yet and I'm not sure why. HFW arrives end of next week ( I waited until mid-week on Amazon to pre-order and now it's back-ordered) and I think I might just dive into that...@SomewhatDamaged The first few hours I was unsure about the game. Very strange(or unique) game and setup with the repeating days and same Maps over and over.But after a while it grew on me and I got totally lost in it for weeks with the infusing of weapons, bizarre atmosphere etc. and I got totally impressed by how different the maps felt at differing times of day. In the end I loved every aspect of the game, especially after mastering most of the abilities and weapons. The online trophies I think is annoying, so I didn’t plat the game, but got about 80% of the trophies.Now I’ll dive into HFW next week. @SomewhatDamaged Oh, and it's alarming to hear you've had problems with the PS5 and needed a repair... What happened? I've had small issues with one PS3 and one PS4 but so far the PS5 is still working.@kyleforrester87 yes - there's nothing like a publication undermining their own reviewer... seriously, my point is that if you have a reviewer, don't sub-text them with someone else who actually is passively under-cutting the review. I actually don't want people to up-sell Sony games if they don't deserve it - and having purchased and started playing HFW, I can say in the first 12 hours it actually is a buggy (surprisingly questionable QA quality compared to HZD) and not that exciting. The solution to the double review is to have a separate post (2nd opinions and counter views are great)... it is just to insert someone else's review into someone's copy is a nasty way to treat your writers IMHO.@KundaliniRising333 they may have patched out most of the shimmer... what I found weird was the incessant poppping in/out of meshes... or in the case of some of the cut scenes - materials with two meshes that didn't match up and were totally immersion breaking (and that was in Chainscrape... like the first main location). It's pretty clear to me that they went too big with HFW (especially as the game is actually 80% the same as the original in gameplay) to the point where they couldn't do proper QA - especially in a COVID environment. I would have preferred half the game with twice the quality. I know a lot will be patched out - but seriously, expected better from Sony and Geurilla. The NPC interactions are infinitely better - however, to be honest, they were wallpaper in the first game, because the real game was running around the Wild taking on Dino-bots.I'd give it a very solid 7/10 or a 7.5 if you did half points. I loved the first one, and on its merits alone Forbidden West is a great game with a little bugginess and the well-worn trope of an open world list of icons looting, crafting, and collectibles. Where this game fails for me is its lack of innovation. Sure, there's things like the hang-glider but on a fundamental core mechanic level this game did not update or improve anything. It looks beautiful on my PS5, but it plays and feels like a game from 2017. A perfect case study in this is the looting system, which requires an animation every. single. time. Ghost of Tsushima felt a little more next-gen in terms of eliminating this specific problem. And I do see it as a problem — I would argue that the repetitive system including but not limited to the animations actually breaks immersion in its frustratingly rhythm-dropping repetition rather than promoting immersion. I could go on, but if you've read this far then you probably get the idea. This is a good game. A really good one. But it doesn't feel like a new one. I love the Horizon series and can't wait to see where it goes next.@Quintumply Red Dead 2 is the most detailed game most of us will play in our lifetimes. I don’t see Rockstar making a game of that caliber ever again if not a very long time.Loved the first game it felt unique and almost different.For me the sequel had been just an average open world game still 7/10 and very much enjoying the game but it’s lost that Sony charm that the original, last of us and god of war managed to achieve.Played it on ps plus. Gave up at the first cauldron. Seems like im playing the first with more tedious story and NPC dialogue. Frustrating aloy mechanics and a bloated combat system. Looks nice however.Finished first one gave up on this bs. .6/10 at a push!

Horizon Forbidden West,Alessio Palumbo,Wccftech,https://wccftech.com/review/horizon-forbidden-west-bigger-and-better-in-every-way/,"For a long time, Dutch developer Guerrilla Games was known to PlayStation gamers as the maker of Killzone, a gritty first-person shooter franchise that had its heyday with the second installment released for PlayStation 3. I was quite the fan of that IP, and I do hope it returns someday (we do know that the studio is juggling a second project, after all), but I am an even bigger fan of open world action roleplaying games. Horizon Zero Dawn rightfully propelled Guerrilla much higher than Killzone ever did with regards to both critical reception and commercial success; the question, though, was whether they could replicate this with Horizon Forbidden West.After playing the sequel almost non-stop for the past two weeks, my answer is that it was no fluke. The developers have managed to craft yet another game that's just as captivating as the original, proceeding to make it bigger and better, even though there's no major open world innovation to be found genre-wise.First things first, though, as there's a lot to unpack. Horizon Forbidden West is literally brimming with content. According to the PS5, I've finished the game after exactly 70 hours of playtime. Guerrilla's developers were a bit coy on the topic of longevity pre-release, suggesting that the game would be about as long as Zero Dawn, but that was really underselling it, given that data from HowLongToBeat reveals the first game (without the Frozen Wilds expansion) could be completed to 100% in just 60 hours. Meanwhile, in Horizon Forbidden West, I've still got over twenty tasks left to do between side quests, errands (briefer side missions), and other types of content.These include stuff already seen in Zero Dawn, such as fighting through various melee pits and hunting grounds, climbing Tallnecks to discover points of interest throughout the region, dismantling rebel operations at outposts/camps, and infiltrating Cauldrons to unlock machine overrides. But there are lots of brand new activities, too, such as the chess-like minigame Machine Strike (clearly inspired by The Witcher's Gwent when it comes to its embedding into the world), the Gauntlet Runs (track races where you'll be using a Charger to be the first to the finish line by all means necessary, including stunning competitors with arrows or shock mines or picking up the nitro-like Blaze boost, in a nod to arcade racing games), Salvage Contracts, the endgame Arena (a challenge to survive against increasingly tough machines to gain medals that can be traded for legendary gear), and Relic Ruins.The latter activity highlights what is, in my opinion, one of the most significant improvements in Horizon Forbidden West: the puzzles. Oftentimes, you'll really have to scratch your head to understand how to get into the next room. The same applies to other points of interest, such as Sunken Caverns (though you'll need to get the diving mask to explore most of those) and other mini-dungeons scattered throughout the whole map. Puzzles in Horizon Forbidden West are nearly on the same level as the most recent Tomb Raider games, which is saying something as they were always a trademark feature of that franchise.Of course, combat remains one of the main things you'll be doing in Horizon Forbidden West. Fighting machines as Aloy is still quite different from most other games, given the focus on archery-based ranged combat. While the game does make an effort to expand melee combat options in multiple ways, including several additional moves, you won't be able to use all that against most machines without getting crushed, as I learned the hard way after dedicating the initial skill points to the Warrior specialization. Additionally, fighting against other humans won't really require you to finely use your melee spec due to the relatively low challenge on average, and there's still no ability to parry.Horizon Forbidden West's most exciting combat is once again experienced against machines. There are dozens of them, each with various strengths and weaknesses, which you'll have to properly exploit when playing on harder difficulties (which I did, and I do recommend it to maximize the enjoyment of your own playthrough).As if to further underline how the game's core is ranged combat, the brand new weapon techniques allow Aloy to spend Stamina to execute various additional effects depending on the bow equipped. For instance, with Sharpshot bows, she can take a kneeling position to charge an incredibly powerful shot, while Boltblasters let her unload an entire clip of ammunition all at once.There are also Valor Surges, which are essentially an Ultimate bar filled through various means during combat. Unfortunately, you can only equip one at a time, and there's no quick way to swap them during combat except by pausing the menu and going through the skill tree again.Needless to say, there are lots of ways to experiment with different combinations of gear and skills, allowing players to create their own playstyles. I do have one minor gripe, though: there's no transmogrification yet. Some of the coolest looking armors aren't necessarily ideal from a perk and stat standpoint, and it would be great to be able to unite both form and function as in most RPGs.The traversal options are also much improved in Horizon Forbidden West. You can grapple to certain predetermined points (even in combat, which is extremely handy to escape the grasp of a rampaging Ravager), and you can also use a Shieldwing to glide down from the higher ground.However, the real gamechanger is only unlocked towards the end of the main quest: flying. That's right; you'll be able to override Sunwing machines and summon them to fly all around the world, which is incredibly cool in and of itself. You won't do any combat while flying (despite there being a barrel roll move), which might be a tad disappointing to some, but rest assured that just experiencing this stunning post-apocalyptic world while airborne is an awesome feeling. I do wish this would have been unlocked earlier, though.That aforementioned long playtime might be partly due to the many cutscenes and dialogues, by the way. I don't have any hard data for comparison, but I reckon there's a lot more in Horizon Forbidden West, particularly if you want to go through every dialogue option to learn absolutely every single thing about a character or a faction. As a lore buff, I loved this, and it reminded me of Mass Effect a bit (alongside something else from the ending, though I won't spoil that). You can often come back to chat with fellow allies after something happens, gaining new perspectives and views on the unfolding events. Additionally, there are even companion quests and a proper headquarters, just like in a Bioware game. Narratively, this is explained with Aloy slowly coming to understand the value of relying on trusted friends, whereas in Zero Dawn she often preferred doing things by herself. It ties well with her necessary growth as a character, that's for sure. She isn't the lone former outcast turned fearsome warrior anymore; she needs to become a commander.The story itself starts slowly but quickly ramps up to unexpected heights in the latter part. The plot eventually goes to some interesting places; some big revelations in Horizon Forbidden West are sure to get fans talking on Reddit and other forums all over the Web. The quality of side quests has increased, too, even though it's still not up to the gold standard of The Witcher III: Wild Hunt.Weirdly enough for a game made by Guerrilla, one area that's not a complete win is the technical side. Don't get me wrong, Horizon Forbidden West looks great for the most part on PlayStation 5, thanks to the improved lighting and character models, but the Performance mode does come with significant downsides. The base resolution is noticeably lowered to ensure that the frame rate remains smooth, which it does with very few exceptions. However, the aliasing introduced in some scenarios (mostly outdoor environments during daylight) was honestly a bit distracting. Even so, it was a no-brainer simply due to how much smoother it felt than the Resolution mode, not only during combat but during the world's exploration, too. Just moving Aloy around feels so much better at 60 frames per second, that's for sure.All this did, though, was make me acutely aware that there was one platform where we could have had it all - PC. After all, Horizon Zero Dawn got NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR not too long ago. High-end rigs will undoubtedly be able to handle Forbidden West at 4K and over 60 frames per second without any impact on image quality, but who knows how long it'll take for this sequel to appear on PC. Given Sony's increasingly multiplatform plans, I wish the inevitable third installment could be unshackled by any console constraints, launching day and date on PC. We'll see if that will be the case.Lastly, I do have to praise the variety of biomes seen in this sequel, as well as the quality of both acting and voice acting, thanks to some great and renowned talents. The soundtrack is excellent, too, and well worth listening to even when outside the game.Reviewed on PlayStation 5 (code provided by the publisher).Horizon Forbidden West is a worthy sequel to Zero Dawn in every way, proving that Guerrilla is no one-hit wonder when it comes to the action RPG genre. This huge and beautiful world has an incredible amount of things to do and most of them are really fun, thanks to improvements to combat and traversal. The game also features another great storyline that will get fans talking about the inevitable sequel.  The links above are affiliate links.

Horizon Forbidden West,John-Paul Jones,PlayStation Universe,https://www.psu.com/reviews/horizon-forbidden-west-review-ps5/," John-Paul Jones / February 14, 2022Horizon Forbidden West PS5 Review. In so many ways, Horizon Forbidden West is the perfect sequel. Treading that very thin and often deceptive line between evolution and revolution, Horizon Forbidden West is a statement of intent from Guerrilla Games. Not only has the legendary Dutch studio kept the essence of one of the greatest games of the last console generation fully intact, but it has also meaningfully iterated upon it too, providing PlayStation gamers with a jaw-dropping Game of the Year candidate in the process. Quite simply, it’s a darn good time to own a PlayStation console – and especially a PlayStation 5 console (if you can find one, that is).Taking place directly after the events of its prequel, Horizon Zero Dawn, Forbidden West doesn’t thrust players right away into the depths of its titular domain. Instead, Aloy must make her way there first, crossing borders and encountering a whole heap of new places, people and areas in between. Though the intially slower pacing might grate a little for some, the feeling of going on an epic journey only adds to the spectacle of the whole affair – affecting a similar feeling to watching the Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit for the first time, say. That feeling of taking part in an odyssey infused with grandeur is borne out by the swathe of new settings that you’ll travel to in Horizon Forbidden West. Though the same leafy forests, dusty deserts and snow-blotted peaks feature in Guerrilla’s sequel, these settings are now complemented by the sort of sun-kissed, idyllic looking coastal regions that one would readily associate with the picturesque North American West Coast.Despite using the same engine that powered Horizon Zero Dawn nearly a half decade ago and also being a cross-gen title, Horizon Forbidden West is nonetheless a stunningly opulent first-party effort that gives the still fairly youthful PlayStation 5 hardware something of a work out. Environment complexity and geometry is much improved over Horizon Zero Dawn, resulting in much more vibrant natural environments and ecosystems that are packed with the sort of incidental detail that you might expect to see in such a flourishing realm in which nature has reclaimed her dominion.Beyond its depiction of a resplendent natural world, where the visual presentation of Horizon Forbidden West also excels is in its realization of the various ruins and landmarks that are dotted around its lush realm. Encompassing a whole range of overworld and underwater cities, together with a range of Old World ruins and settlements that each deftly represent the bespoke visual motifs of their tribe, Horizon Forbidden West fashions a world that is surprisingly visually diverse and one which certainly plays to substantial strengths of Guerrilla’s crew of talented artists.Further Reading – Horizon Forbidden West Accessibility Features Include Co-Pilot System, Subtitles, And MoreFrom a purely technical perspective, Horizon Forbidden West also brings the goods too. Though many of the same animations carry over from Horizon Zero Dawn (Forbidden West is its sequel after all), the visuals see an across-the-board improvement, resulting in everything from much more nuanced facial animations on character models, to much improved lighting, shadow effects and generally a far more detailed visual presentation than what we had in Horizon Zero Dawn. Certainly then, while I would have loved to have seen Horizon Forbidden West take full advantage of the PlayStation 5 hardware, Guerrilla’s sequel nonetheless is a stunning game that stands as one of the most impressive cross-generation games to date.The icing on the cake however, are the two visual presets that Horizon Forbidden West allows players to choose from on PlayStation 5 – namely Resolution and Performance focused modes which each strive for a different technical presentation at 30 FPS/4K and 60 FPS/1440p respectively. However, as has largely been proven the case with just about every PlayStation 5 release to date, Performance mode is absolutely, positively the way to go, as it quite literally transforms Horizon Forbidden West into a much more responsive experience, where everything from platforming to combat is much smoother, much snappier and by proxy, much more enjoyable. Of course the fact remains that with Horizon Forbidden West’s Performance mode you’re trading visual quality for framerate – a welcome trade for sure, but one that does result in Horizon’s sequel losing just a small portion of the sharpness that helps to bring out even the smallest details in its world. Don’t let the fact that Horizon Forbidden West is a cross-gen effort fool you; Guerrilla’s sequel makes full and wholesome use of the PlayStation 5’s other neat hardware features. Loading a saved game from the main menu takes just over seven seconds, while the use of the PlayStation 5’s Tempest 3D audio technology allows you to not only hear enemies approaching Aloy from any angle, but also take in the subtle environmental sounds of a beautiful world that is regaining its primacy.Further Reading – Horizon Forbidden West Themed Costumes Coming To Sackboy: A Big AdventureBy far though, it is the one-two combination punch of the DualSense’s haptic feedback and adaptive triggers that really draw you into Aloy’s world. Guerrilla Games have done a fantastic job of leveraging the Dualsense haptic feedback as a conduit for the player to feel everything that Aloy feels. From the palpable rolling thunder of riding a hulk Bristleback over treacherous terrain, to the tense feeling of a taut steel cable sliding its way through your hands as Aloy rides a zip-line at speed, Horizon Forbidden West stands out as one of the most impressive uses of haptic feedback so far.When it comes to the adaptive triggers, these are employed deftly to replicate the feeling of resistance when Aloy pulls back a bow, winds up a disc thrower or tightens a sling and in the process make the many encounters in Horizon Forbidden West feel much more keenly immersive than ever before. Ostensibly, all of this technical stuff is ultimately just prologue – where Horizon Forbidden West truly excels is in how it blends a genuinely captivating story and tactical combat with an open world that just begs to be explored. First though, the story. With the initial world building of Horizon Zero Dawn behind it, Forbidden West can look to build upon the narrative bedrock established in the first game and peel away at the corners of what we know about Aloy’s world, gradually unveiling a gorgeously realised and sophisticated setting that is both bursting with detail and revelation at nearly every turn.Further Reading – Ghost Of Tsushima Director’s Cut Update Adds An Aloy Surprise To Celebrate Horizon Forbidden West’s Upcoming LaunchNewly crowned as the saviour of Meridian, a resolute but troubled Aloy follows in the footsteps of the mysterious Sylens in search of a backup of the GAIA artificial intelligence to restore the natural world, uncovering an all-new threat in the process that harkens back to the ancient past. And… that’s it. I really can’t say much more than that at all without veering into connect-the-dots spoiler territory and for the sake of everyone who plays this game, Horizon Forbidden West’s plot is much more emotionally charged than its predecessor too, marking significant changes in Aloy’s character and companions that will surely be discussed for a while to come. Again, there will be no spoilers here – Horizon Forbidden West’s story is absolutely worth experiencing as fresh as possible.Speaking of Aloy, despite enjoying premium guest spots in other games such as Fortnite, Fall Guys and Genshin Impact, the fact remains that Horizon’s flame-haired firebrand has been greatly missed and her place as one of PlayStation Studios marquee heroes remains well-earned, thanks in no small part to Ashly Burch’s superlative vocal performance that continues to elevate the character duly.Further Reading – Horizon Forbidden West On PS5 Can Be Purchased $10 Cheaper If You Get It Via A Web BrowserAway from the more intimate and low-level beats of the story, the scribes at Guerrilla Games should also be applauded for ambitiously expanding the themes and wider background elements of Horizon’s world. A veritable kaleidoscope of science fiction, spirituality and how they intersect, Horizon Forbidden West muses on how humanity might regress after the fall of the world, with certain tribes idolizing some machines as gods, while others remain resolutely apocryphal and superstitious about the presence of those very same machines. And really, that’s the main overarching thrust of Horizon Forbidden West – it’s ultimately an epic meditation about how humankind might rise or fall further from its seeming nadir. While it hardly seems like a ground-breaking premise in the face of so many other post-apocalyptic fables, Horizon Forbidden West’s unique blend of sci-fi, religion and a vibrant setting, makes it all feel much more fresh than the usual dusty, radiation blasted/infection riddled hellscapes that we’re usually made privy to. A key part of this setting and arguably an equally iconic foil to Aloy herself are the numerous machines that have also sought to claim the remnants of the world for themselves. The various machines of Forbidden West are arguably more fun to tangle with than their flesh and blood counterparts. With each one presenting a mechanical facsimile of one of mother nature’s creations, encompassing such creatures as bulls, wolves, eagles, kangaroos and more. Again, for fear of spoiling a game that absolutely should be experienced as fresh as possible, I’ll not spill the details on Horizon Forbidden West’s more jaw-dropping machines – and trust me, your jaw will drop.Further Reading – PlayStation Studios Games – Every Confirmed And Rumored First Party PS5 Title In DevelopmentMuch like Horizon Zero Dawn, the machines bring with them a certain amount of sophistication to the combat system thanks in no small part to their unique attributes, strengths, weaknesses and bespoke attack patterns. As such, Horizon Forbidden West brings back that familiar thrill of combining melee, ranged and trap based attacks in order to outthink your machine foes, developing a strategy that is at once tricky to pull off later in the game, but amazingly satisfying when you do.There’s nothing quite like baiting a Sunwing with a shower of arrows into an acid bomb you prepped earlier, or carefully using tear ammo to blast off key components of a WIdemaw for use in crafting later. Clearly then, combat in Horizon Forbidden West is as satisfyingly creative as it always was, but here the developers have also made some welcome improvements to boot.Though ranged combat remains largely unchanged, it’s the melee side of the equation that Guerrilla Games has given the most love to, as Aloy can now perform an extended set of fairly sophisticated combination attacks, chaining together various strikes in a way that feels utterly satisfying. Another big change that Horizon Forbidden West brings is the notion of Valour Surges. Essentially one off special skills that must be recharged by attacking (and being attacked by) enemies, there are two Valour Surges embedded within each of the six skill trees in Horizon Forbidden West with each one performing a tide-turning function such as providing Aloy with extra attack power, a durable damage shield or even invisibility.Further Reading – Horizon Forbidden West Official Strategy Guide Releasing In MarchAs mentioned previously, Horizon Forbidden West boasts six skill trees (versus the four seen in Zero Dawn), that each provide an avenue for players to fully customise their playstyle and approach to combat. Coupled with the greatly improved melee combat and the new Valor Surge mechanic, quite simply combat and progression in Horizon Forbidden West feels more rewarding and compelling than ever before. This is intelligent third-person combat done right.Of course when Aloy isn’t smashing up machines or following the beats of the main story, players will be spending their time wandering the wide expanse of Horizon’s Forbidden West and it is here that the game perhaps shows the least amount of growth from a design perspective. Many of the open world activities from the first game return – such as the Hunting Ground trials, hacking Tallnecks, matching up Vista images, conquering Cauldrons, tracking down odd collectibles and more besides. Essentially then, this represents something of a two-edged sword in that if you’re currently experiencing open world fatigue (which can easily accumulate from one game to the next – I’m looking at you Far Cry, Assassin’s Creed and Watch Dogs), then the idea of these activities might come across as suffocating busywork. If however, you simply cannot spend enough time in Horizon’s world and want to do everything that the game can offer you, then you’re in good hands with Horizon Forbidden West.Further Reading – PS5 Enhanced Games List – Every PS4, PS5 Game With Enhanced Graphics Modes In 2022That’s not to say though that the full array of side activities in Horizon Forbidden West are all quite so predictable. Indeed, the various side quests that you’ll ran into throughout the game are easily a cut above what was presented in Horizon Zero Dawn, often being well constructed tests of your platforming and exploration prowess that not only reward you duly, but make you want to keep on doing more of them as you uncover more of the Horizon Forbidden West’s world. Elsewhere, additional activities such as using flying machines and other such distractions also help to alleviate the occasional over-familiarity that Horizon Forbidden West’s extracurricular tasks sometimes causes. With a span of nearly five(!) years existing between Horizon Forbidden West and its immediate prequel, it becomes clear that there is a sense of grandeur that oozes from the digital pores of the Horizon games that no other genre effort has come close to replicating. More than that, Horizon Forbidden West arguably represents an offering that sits near the apex of the open world, action adventure genre, presenting a more mature (not to be confused with gritty) world and story compared to its predecessor. Pointedly, Horizon Forbidden West not only furthers the narrative of one of PlayStation’s most recognisable icons, but also manages to reassure PlayStation gamers of the rude health of PlayStation Studios sterling reputation for creating stunning first-party, single-player adventures. In every way that it can be, Horizon Forbidden West is Horizon Zero Dawn 2.0 and while I might crave some more variety in its open-world activities, Guerrilla Games has nonetheless crafted a triumphant sequel that earns its place among the very best that PlayStation Studios has to offer.Horizon Forbidden West releases for PS4 and PS5 on February 18, 2022.Review code kindly provided by PR.Horizon Forbidden West not only furthers the narrative of one of PlayStation's most recognisable icons, but also manages to reassure PlayStation gamers of the rude health of PlayStation Studios sterling reputation for creating stunning first-party, single-player adventures.

Horizon Forbidden West,Justin Clark,Slant Magazine,https://www.slantmagazine.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west-review/,"The game is devoted above all else to making the player believe that its world is worth saving and that its people are worth knowing.Perhaps the greatest problem plaguing open world games is a certain desperation to be all things to all players. Many of the great ones are able to dodge that trap by doubling down on gameplay, but it’s becoming a rare thing to see a game truly emphasize its characters above all else. That by itself makes Horizon Forbidden West a stellar outlier, as Guerilla Games treats the diverse NPCs that fill the game’s vibrant world with a care and consideration that most developers do not dream of bestowing on their open world titles.That primacy is evident in everything from the way that the NPCs look to the way they act and sound. It’s also in the way that Aloy, our flame-haired heroine, slowly comes to terms with the beauty of life and sets out to defend its integrity. The game evolves a few of Horizon Zero Dawn’s mechanical ideas in organic, enjoyable ways, but they aren’t why you’ll want to return to the game long after the credits have rolled. It’s Aloy’s allegiance to the preservation of life.In the game’s menu is a laundry list of NPCs who need Aloy’s help, and whose stories—even late into the campaign as you’re unlocking new weapons and facing down heretofore unseen mechanical monstrosities—you’ll want to see through to the very end. That alone attests to the depth of feeling and purposefulness demonstrated by Horizon Forbidden West’s interactive storytelling. On a very fundamental level, the game is devoted to making the player believe that its world is worth saving and that its people are worth knowing.Aloy’s world is in danger, under siege from a deadly red weed called the Blight, a rogue tribe of warrior zealots led by a hardline separatist named Regalla (voiced by a mildly underutilized Angela Bassett) going on a country-wide murder spree, and a group of bastards called Far Zenith who, as they essentially consider themselves a kind of master race, are seemingly bent on wiping the Earth clean. That’s all in addition to the devil we already know from the first game: massive robot dinosaurs who are still roaming the land, and who are much more fun to deal with this time around thanks to a series of thoughtful quality-of-life gameplay tweaks.Many of the first game’s higher-end upgrades (calling a mount from anywhere, free fast travel from campsites, basic creature overrides, slow-motion when firing arrows) are unlocked at the outset and joined by other welcome improvements. For one, melee combat has a combo system that adds complexity to face-to-face skirmishes. Elemental weaknesses on mechanical enemies can be exploited to do damage, strip parts off, or cause explosive overloads.Climbing, in particular, seems to have taken a page from Death Stranding, with a Focus function that now allows players to see which surfaces and objects are traversable. The gameplay mechanics that inform the robot-hunting, while not as complex as those in, say, the Monster Hunter games, are at least varied, allowing players to approach problems in their own way, where Horizon Zero Dawn tended to simply funnel players into preset killzones.If there are moments throughout Horizon Forbidden West where you feel the linearity of the adventure a little too much, it makes up for that by endearing us to its characters, to the bite-sized episodic stories that fill its vast, startlingly detailed open world, and by making every activity have meaning to someone within it. Even the Tallneck tasks—this series’s version of the typical open-world “climb a tower, reveal the map” trope—have been crafted not just as self-contained action set pieces that are more thrilling and adrenaline-pumping than most full games, but as one more occasion to tell us stories of the world that was and how it collapsed.That connection to the past is also this game’s ace in the hole, giving us a parallel story to Aloy figuring out how to save her world, filling in the blanks left unanswered by Horizon Zero Dawn. As in that game, these stories are captivating, sad, and, at times, terrifying. There’s a story mission late in the campaign that starts as a sneering allegory of primitive people trying to emulate the CEOs and tech bros of the 21st century that slowly curdles into outright horror story, suggesting a mix of Claire Denis’s High Life and a no-holds-barred Mummy remake.There are dozens of stories across Horizon Forbidden West that are every bit as cool, engaging, and thoughtful as that one. That makes it somewhat disappointing that the main story doesn’t quite hit the same heights in the end, as there’s a sagging middle that takes a little of the wind out of the finale. But it’s not something that’s worth sweating over, as the company that Aloy keeps consistently makes the trek work taking every step of the way.This game was reviewed using a retail copy purchased by the reviewer.Justin Clark is a gaming critic based out of Massachusetts.

Horizon Forbidden West,Christopher Byrd,Washington Post,https://www.washingtonpost.com/comics/2022/02/18/horizon-zero-forbidden-west-not-much-more-than-another-save-the-world-adventure-game/,"This article was published more than 1 year agoHorizon Forbidden WestDeveloped by: Guerrilla GamesPublished by: Sony Interactive EntertainmentAvailable on: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5When “Horizon Zero Dawn” debuted in 2017 I was struck by how well Guerrilla Games, a studio which, until then, was best known for their Killzone series of first-person shooters, was able to use its talent to create a blockbuster-style adventure game that held my attention despite its formulaic story line. After spending a couple dozen hours with the sequel, little has changed in my assessment of the young franchise, but the novelty has worn off. “Horizon Forbidden West” is a competent, if conventional, action game that is undercut by its wildly inconsistent narrative elements.Set far into the distant future, the game picks up the story of Aloy, a young woman who endeavors to save the world from calamitous ruin. (In the words of the classic Smiths song, “Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before.”) Aloy is a genetic clone of the scientist who helped create GAIA, a terraforming system that reordered the environment after a cataclysmic disaster precipitated by rogue, AI-controlled, war machines. Alas, the system has broken down, leaving a form of blight to sweep the world — devastating crops and corrupting the animallike machines that were once caretakers of the land.During the opening we find Aloy searching for a way to reboot GAIA. After pursuing a number of dead-ends she has grown frustrated with her task, though she is still committed to seeing it through. Eventually she comes across a promising lead that takes her to the land of Plainsong, a place where the governing council conducts public policy through choral singing. Unlike the Nora, Aloy’s tribe who traditionally shun technology, the Utaru, the people of Plainsong, revere the machines that roam the earth, and call them land gods. As in the first game, the most potent narrative tension comes from Aloy’s interactions with people whose faith she finds misplaced. “Why does every priest I meet think blind faith is the answer?” she says to herself at one point, underscoring the skeptical humanism that defines her sensibility.In a sacred cave held dear to the Utaru, Aloy discovers a backup of GAIA, yet any relief she feels is short-lived since, to make GAIA fully functional, Aloy must locate four of GAIA’s “subordinate functions” that are scattered in different regions of the map. Exploring the Forbidden West — the large landmass where most of the game takes place — you’ll encounter the same sorts of diversions found in any number of open-world games. There are puzzle rooms to explore, trials to participate in and lots of people to help out. Given that Aloy is tasked with saving the world, it’s understandable that she looks more than a little put upon by the requests people make of her to track down culinary ingredients and the like. The problem is that no amount of finessing can mask the fact that “Horizon Forbidden West” plays like a by-the-numbers open world game. Making my way through it, I was unable to shake the feeling that with a palette swap here and there I could just as easily have been playing Tomb Raider.Familiar mechanics notwithstanding, what truly threw me for a loop was the uneven quality of the cutscenes. The acting in Forbidden West ranges from impressive to abominable. On the plus side, Erica Luttrell, who plays the strong-willed Utaru warrior Zo, is excellent. She plays the role with grace and restraint, in contrast to some of the other actors who seem preoccupied with maintaining their faux accents. Given Horizon Forbidden West’s AAA production values, I was even more caught off guard by the poor quality of the mise-en-scene in several of the cutscenes. I texted a friend and fellow critic that, considering how awkwardly they look past each other in some scenes, it didn’t even seem like the actors were sharing the same space. My friend replied they seemed as if they were pasted onto a backdrop, like something out of a 1990s game that used pre-rendered graphics.The overriding question “Horizon Forbidden West” left me with is “when will its prospective audience grow tired of the tired conventions that underwrite so many go-and-save-the-world adventure games?” As much as I appreciated the fun that came from smashing up robots, “Horizon Forbidden West” won’t earn a spot in my long-term memory.Christopher Byrd is a Brooklyn-based writer.

Horizon Forbidden West,Alyse Stanley,Washington Post,https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/reviews/horizon-forbidden-west-review/,"This article was published more than 1 year agoHorizon Forbidden WestAvailable on: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5Developer: Guerrilla Games | Publisher: SonyRelease: Feb. 18, 2022Under embargo: We were asked not to share details around certain mainline quests as well as several primary characters.Whenever a highly anticipated sequel comes out, there’s the inevitable question of how it stacks up to the original. “Horizon Zero Dawn,” Guerrilla Games’ award-winning, 2017 open-world RPG, set a high bar with its compelling story and gorgeous environments. I can definitively say after rolling credits on “Forbidden West” that it not only meets that bar, it parkours over it and soars off on a robo-bird into the sunset.“Forbidden West” hits the ground running. Within the first hour, you’re introduced to one of the many new tools in Aloy’s arsenal: the “Pullcaster,” a grappling hook that puts a new dimension at your disposal for free climbing — and the first sign that “Forbidden West” is aiming for an entirely different scale than its predecessor. From a physical standpoint, it expands vertically in both directions through the addition of underwater exploration and gliding mechanics. And narratively, “Forbidden West” explores concepts both large and small with satisfying poignancy; dialogue with companions feels rich and alive. The excellent writing and world-building combined with the PlayStation 5′s haptic feedback facilitates a new degree of immersion.Before ‘Horizon Forbidden West’: Inside the origins of Aloy and the Horizon seriesThe game follows Aloy once more, an outcast turned redeemer of a world in ruins. Set long after a plague of killer robots consumed all life on Earth, a primitive society has sprouted with the help of project Zero Dawn, a global network of terraforming systems and biomatter incubators built as humanity stared down imminent extinction. An AI named Gaia was designed to operate the system autonomously and revitalize Earth using nine subroutines, each with a specific function to make the planet hospitable again or restore life (purifying waterways, making the air breathable, reintroducing animals created from genetic stockpiles, etc.) Terraforming machines with designs inspired by birds, deer, dinosaurs and other animals were originally intended to help maintain the delicate ecosystem, but in recent decades they’ve fallen out of humanity’s control and grown violent.Following the events of “Horizon Zero Dawn,” Aloy is clearly uncomfortable with the hero worship her escapades inspired far and wide, having grown up largely alone and shunned by her tribe, and knowing that few around her comprehend the gravity of what’s at stake. In one of the first cutscenes, she notices a statue honoring her as the city of Meridian’s “savior” and cringes.Gaia maintained the biosphere for centuries until a mysterious cyber attack forced her to self-destruct. Now Aloy must find a way to restore Gaia and get her subordinate functions up and running again, stumbling into the role of ambassador and peacekeeper for the colorful communities she finds along the way. Between gathering a ragtag group of fair-weather allies, setting up a home base and meticulously planning your crew’s next big move, the plot takes on the vibe of an Ocean’s movie — if the heist involved saving the world.The environments you explore make it clear Guerrilla Games delights in giving players a range of options to solve any one problem. On battlefields, you’ll find dead machines with combustible parts, ledges to grapple to and from which to rain down arrows, or zip lines to escape in a pinch. To infiltrate an enemy base, you can sneak in on foot or try to find a nearby waterway and take advantage of the game’s new underwater exploration, surfacing deep in enemy territory. The environment becomes part of your arsenal in a way that feels natural and seamless.The Pullcaster is one of several innovative tweaks to the first game’s clunky climbing mechanics. Instead of yellow or white paint splatters denoting climbable ledges, you can now use Aloy’s “Focus,” the head-mounted AR device that gives what the locals call her second sight, to detect and highlight handholds automatically on any structure, both natural and man-made. It’s a cross between the Animus technology in Assassin’s Creed and the free climbing of “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.” Some of the most fun I had playing was when I’d get lost in the sprawling environments, with the freedom to dive underwater and swim through sunken ruins or easily summit a mountain at a whim fueling an addictive cycle of discovery.“Forbidden West” also takes a page from the Uncharted series in the environmental puzzles Aloy finds throughout her journey. Their solutions require manipulating a variety of tools like weighted panels, movable boxes and Aloy’s glider to keep things interesting.After playing for more than 40 hours, I’m still mesmerized by the core gameplay loop of building up my tool kit and adjusting my approach to take on new, more powerful machines. More than that, though, I’m mesmerized by the world. So many small details work in tandem to make it feel alive. At one point, while traveling through the desert, a small twister touched down nearby as I fought a herd of machines. I thought it was just a part of the scenery — until I strayed too close and began losing health. As you progress, NPCs reference Aloy’s adventures in passing, adding honorifics to her name that change based on which quests you’ve completed.The haptic feedback on the PlayStation 5 controller adds another layer to this immersion. There’s a satisfying weight to Aloy’s bow as you draw each arrow back for a shot, feeling the tension in the string vibrate through the controller. Sneaking through waist-high grass is a different sensation from strolling across open terrain. When I stab my spear forward, there’s more resistance on the trigger depending on the toughness of the surface I’m stabbing.A feel for the game: The developers behind the PS5 dish on the console's new features“Forbidden West’s” graphical issues occasionally shatter this immersion. These issues persisted even after installing a “day one” patch Sony pushed out last week. I ran into problems with textures and objects failing to fully load or popping in, as well as important items that wouldn’t function as designed until I restarted the quest. The issues began cropping up about halfway through my playthrough, and became more frequent the further I progressed. During one cutscene, the game seemed to decide midway through that, actually, the scene was taking place underwater, and everyone’s hair started flowing accordingly.Most of the time, though, the visuals work without a hitch, and when that happens the results are stunning. “Forbidden West” luxuriates in its breathtaking set pieces. Cinematic shots are woven in naturally as you climb mountains or scavenge through relics of the old world. The ruins of real-world cities are some of the most visually stunning game environments in recent memory.Occasional graphical issues aside, my leading criticism of “Forbidden West” is that, like a lot of open-world games, it feels bloated. When it comes to climbing Tall Necks, a type of side quest players will remember from the first game, Guerrilla Games shakes up the formula enough to keep things from feeling stale or repetitive. The same can’t be said of “Forbidden West’s” dozens of other side quests. The quality of writing and voice acting takes a steep dive compared to the mainline quests and characters. There are a dizzying number of optional activities dotting the world map, some of which are genuinely fun (like mech racing); others, meanwhile, feel shoehorned in at best (like the tabletop minigame NPCs won’t stop challenging me to play).Combat in “Zero Dawn” wasn’t exactly simple, but “Forbidden West” piles on new weapon techniques and combos until the mechanics reach an intimidating level of density. Multistep combos are easily disrupted either by an enemy attack or a slight difference in elevation. I consistently ran into a glitch when activating “Valor Surges,” powerful new stat boosts tied to Aloy’s skill trees, where the camera would veer off uncontrollably until I aimed down the sight of my bow again. After extensive experimenting, I fell back to a tactic that got me through “Zero Dawn”: bombarding enemies with explosives. Still, I did enjoy some of the new weapons: I found a variation of the throwing spear, a powerful but slow ranged weapon, that could lodge into enemies and detonate with an explosion. It quickly became my go-to.I checked my progress after the credits rolled. Apparently, I’ve only completed 43 percent of the game. Even after 40 hours, I feel like I’ve only scratched the surface. While I likely won’t exhaust every quest and errand and bizarre board game “Forbidden West” has to offer, I still feel compelled to explore more of its expansive, thriving world — just to see how Aloy’s adventures continue to change it for the better."
